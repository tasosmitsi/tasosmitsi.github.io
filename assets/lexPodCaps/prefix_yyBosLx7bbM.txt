00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
friend is telling me that the volcano seems to be starting to erupt. If that volcano goes off,

00:06.160 --> 00:13.040
we have nowhere to go. That got my attention. So if you say scared, I would say that

00:13.760 --> 00:18.400
I got the realization that what that meant. I went cold for a fraction of a second,

00:19.040 --> 00:23.760
but that meant that just my adrenaline started to kick in. And it was a very,

00:23.760 --> 00:27.920
very strange experience because now you have tunnel vision, it's about survival.

00:30.320 --> 00:35.200
The following is a conversation with Natalie Gabral, an astrobiologist and scientist at the

00:35.200 --> 00:41.520
SETI Institute, directing the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe. She explores

00:41.520 --> 00:47.040
some of the harshest places on earth, including free diving and volcanic lakes, all in the pursuit

00:47.040 --> 00:53.600
of understanding living organisms beyond earth. For this, she holds the woman's world record

00:53.680 --> 01:00.640
for diving at altitude, both scuba and free diving. She's amazing. This is the Lex Fridman

01:00.640 --> 01:04.560
podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,

01:04.560 --> 01:10.720
dear friends, here's Natalie Gabral. You are the director of the Carl Sagan

01:10.720 --> 01:14.880
Center for Research at the SETI Institute. SETI, of course, stands for Search for

01:14.880 --> 01:21.600
Extraterrestrial Intelligence. One of the things you do as part of that is travel to some of earth's

01:21.600 --> 01:26.240
most extreme and dangerous environments in search of organisms that live in conditions

01:26.240 --> 01:33.120
analogous to those on Mars. First, let me ask what the job posting for the work you do looks like.

01:33.120 --> 01:38.320
Is it like Shackleton's ad in 1900 that said people wanted for hazardous journey to the

01:38.320 --> 01:43.840
South Pole? Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger.

01:43.840 --> 01:50.640
And also, where do I apply? That's funny because there was not really a job application. In fact,

01:50.640 --> 01:56.240
when you are a scientist, you have questions in your mind and you have hypotheses and you start

01:56.240 --> 02:01.440
to list the kind of thing you need to answer. Then when you see the kind of thing you have to

02:01.440 --> 02:08.240
answer, then you kind of know the places where you need to go to do that. As far as science is

02:08.240 --> 02:16.640
concerned, I started with analyzing data from the Mars missions. I had written a PhD about water on

02:16.640 --> 02:26.400
Mars, first looking at channels and the history evolution of water. But then during my postdoc,

02:27.040 --> 02:33.440
I started to look where that water was ponding. Interestingly enough, everybody was about channels

02:33.440 --> 02:39.120
and water and whether catastrophic or what not or seepage. But when you are talking about

02:39.760 --> 02:46.320
ponding water like lakes or ocean, people started waving their arms a little bit.

02:46.320 --> 02:52.720
It was a little bit of a battle, interestingly enough. But that got us on track with my husband.

02:53.600 --> 03:00.400
We were working together and we started developing the idea, the concept of lakes in impact craters.

03:01.680 --> 03:08.160
Why in impact craters? Just because the Viking mission at the time, which is what we were working

03:08.160 --> 03:14.560
with, the resolution and the topography were so poor that there was really no way of telling

03:14.560 --> 03:20.960
where you had a real low in the topography. The only thing you knew was a hole in the ground was

03:20.960 --> 03:25.520
an impact crater. When you saw valleys. What was the Viking mission?

03:25.520 --> 03:32.960
The Viking mission landed on Mars in 1976. There were two landers and two orbiters. They were really

03:33.920 --> 03:38.720
our first feet on the ground on Mars, but they were lander. They were not moving. They were not

03:38.720 --> 03:40.800
going up. That was the data you were looking at?

03:40.800 --> 03:48.080
It was already in the 90s, but we didn't have yet the Mars Global Surveyor and what not. We still

03:48.080 --> 03:53.280
worked for 20 years. We worked on that. I did my master and my PhD thesis on Viking missions.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.680
You mentioned that the places you go to are defined by the questions you want to ask.

03:58.880 --> 04:02.480
Let's just step back. What questions have always tugged at your heart?

04:03.440 --> 04:11.840
That's the thing. That's why I was looking at those images and saw some lakes. Then came time

04:11.840 --> 04:19.040
where we started talking about sending landers and rovers on Mars and looking maybe at the

04:19.040 --> 04:25.360
possibility that Mars was habitable. Lakes are particularly good places to look for those

04:25.360 --> 04:30.560
questions. This is how it all ties up. You were always curious about life out there.

04:30.560 --> 04:36.240
I have been always curious about life in the universe and about questions on how we got to

04:36.240 --> 04:45.200
be here and the bigger question. Now with 25 years more in that business, it's more about

04:45.200 --> 04:50.320
understanding the origin and nature of life rather than whether there is life or not on Mars.

04:51.440 --> 04:56.080
This was really for me a stepping stone to bigger questions, but they were definitely

04:56.080 --> 05:02.880
important because they helped me frame my way of thinking about those questions.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.360
Looking at Mars, at lakes, understanding what the conditions were

05:08.080 --> 05:14.160
3.5 billion years ago or close to 4 billion years ago, then I knew the type of environment

05:14.160 --> 05:21.040
I needed to explore here on Earth as analogous to be able to understand what type of life

05:22.000 --> 05:26.720
still survives in those environments and what kind of instrument and what kind of resolution

05:26.720 --> 05:34.480
do I need to actually detect it. So this is how the whole thing started. It started with a small

05:34.480 --> 05:40.880
grant, literally 40K. It was a discretionary fund and this is how I got started in my career.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.760
So many of these questions you can answer by looking at life and extreme conditions here

05:45.920 --> 05:53.200
on Earth, but let's step back a little bit and look at Mars and lakes on Mars.

05:53.200 --> 06:00.080
Just going back to your PhD and before and maybe today, what do we understand about life on Mars?

06:00.960 --> 06:05.280
What do we understand about lakes on Mars? Is there water on Mars? What do we understand

06:05.280 --> 06:10.880
about the conditions from 4 billion years ago on Mars? Well, we've gone a long way. Remember from

06:10.880 --> 06:15.920
the Viking where we had a little bit more resolution than with Mariners.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.760
What did you think at that time? Sorry to interrupt. Just take us back to that mindset.

06:19.760 --> 06:27.760
It was really the exploration, your first look at a planet. You have to remember that the first

06:27.760 --> 06:35.680
mission that successfully snapped some pictures of Mars was Mariner 4. And then everybody at that

06:35.760 --> 06:44.240
time was still under the spell of H. Wells and the idea that Mars looked with a telescope

06:44.880 --> 06:51.680
so similar to the Earth. Polar caps, we could see them with a telescope and we knew it had

06:51.680 --> 07:00.000
seasoned. The actual tilt is pretty much the same as the one for Earth. So when Mariner 4 left,

07:00.000 --> 07:05.120
everybody, not everybody, but a lot of people thought that we were seeing crystal cities and

07:05.120 --> 07:11.040
domes and stuff that another civilization might have evolved in parallel to us in the source

07:11.040 --> 07:16.640
system. And of course, when the first images came back and Mars looked with that kind of resolution

07:16.640 --> 07:26.000
it had like the moon, it was a huge disappointment. Then Mariner 9 came and that changed everything.

07:26.640 --> 07:34.400
There was a little bit of drama because Mars started one of the biggest dust storms it ever

07:34.400 --> 07:39.760
experienced. And so for three months we had an orbiter circling around Mars and not seeing

07:39.760 --> 07:47.520
anything. But then when the dust cleared, all of a sudden we started discovering volcanoes,

07:47.520 --> 07:54.000
valleys, ancient channels, dune fields, polar caps, and see what I'm talking to you? I don't need to

07:54.000 --> 08:04.240
invent any words to describe Mars. And although the myth of extraterrestrial civilization on Mars

08:04.800 --> 08:11.760
was gone, all of a sudden the imagination of the scientists started to pick up because right away

08:11.760 --> 08:18.480
we were seeing something that was familiar that we could describe. So right away Viking

08:18.480 --> 08:25.040
would put on the fast track and the idea was, so Mars looks so much like Earth could have been,

08:25.040 --> 08:31.600
although it's arid and there is little atmosphere, etc. Could there be life? And of course,

08:31.600 --> 08:42.320
behind this at the time there were people like Klein and Sagan, Carl Sagan, just thinking about

08:42.880 --> 08:49.600
how can we test the idea of biology of life on Mars. So this is what Viking did. But of course,

08:49.600 --> 08:57.200
at the time when the two landers arrived on Mars, we didn't have the context of the geology of the

08:57.200 --> 09:04.800
environment. We didn't have much data at all. So the data that Viking sent back was very confusing.

09:05.440 --> 09:10.960
Some people still think today that we discovered life on Mars at the time because some of the

09:10.960 --> 09:16.880
experiment turned out to show a strange signal. But most of the community think that it can be

09:16.880 --> 09:22.640
explained by chemical reaction that we see today. So it was so confusing that NASA decided, say,

09:22.640 --> 09:27.680
okay, if we want to be serious about looking for life on Mars, we have to understand the

09:27.680 --> 09:36.240
environment because life and environment co-evolve. So as cause or effect, a planet is going to give

09:36.240 --> 09:41.920
you the physicochemical environment for life to happen. These are the boundaries. But once

09:41.920 --> 09:49.920
life is here, it's going to change everything. One of the biggest impacts of life was to inject

09:49.920 --> 09:56.320
oxygen into the atmosphere of the Earth 2 billion years ago. And that changed everything, including

09:56.320 --> 10:02.560
our signature in space. So there is this co-evolution. So if you want to understand one,

10:02.560 --> 10:06.800
you have to remove the other from the equation. It's kind of a too unknown equation.

10:06.800 --> 10:14.400
So even though oxygen changes our signature today, what if all life on Earth died? And now we fast

10:14.400 --> 10:20.640
forward a billion years, what would be the traces left? So the question I'm trying to ask is,

10:21.440 --> 10:26.240
if life had existed on Mars, what would be the signs we would look for?

10:26.240 --> 10:31.760
That's a very good question. The thing is that if you draw the parallel with Earth,

10:31.760 --> 10:40.560
it took 82% of Earth geological history to go from very simple life, microbial life,

10:40.560 --> 10:45.120
to complexity. And when I'm saying complexity, I'm not even talking about us. I'm talking about

10:45.120 --> 10:52.800
animals. So Mars is smaller, lost its magnetic field very fast, and lost its atmosphere very fast.

10:54.160 --> 11:00.560
Life also appeared on Earth very fast. So the condition being quite similar at that time

11:00.560 --> 11:04.320
between the Earth and Mars. Let's assume for a moment that life appeared on Mars.

11:04.320 --> 11:11.520
It would have been simple life when conditions started to degrade, which was less than a billion

11:11.520 --> 11:19.040
years after the planet had formed. So everything at the surface would have disappeared, except maybe

11:19.040 --> 11:25.280
for morphological traces of the interaction between life and its environment. So on Earth,

11:25.280 --> 11:32.320
the best examples are what we call stromatolites. These are rock formations that are built by

11:32.320 --> 11:38.880
microbes. So we know that. We know how to recognize them. You could have chemical traces

11:38.880 --> 11:45.440
as well. There are some interesting question marks right now about carbon isotopes at Gale Crater,

11:46.000 --> 11:52.640
because we found an abundance of C12, which normally is used by life on Earth. But it can

11:53.120 --> 11:58.000
be produced by other things. So it's not that it's a real biosignature in itself,

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
but it's intriguing. We have now the C12 and we have methane. But going back, it's a time on Mars,

12:06.000 --> 12:10.480
3.5 billion years ago, where you have lots of destructions, where you have lots of impact

12:10.480 --> 12:18.640
cratering, etc. But we still have very old rocks that survived from that time. So these are good

12:19.440 --> 12:24.240
places. That's why we're sending the rovers in those places, ancient lakes and impact craters

12:24.240 --> 12:29.680
and places where you have very old rocks. So when you say ancient lakes and impact craters,

12:29.680 --> 12:36.320
the simple question, so impact crater is a crater created by a giant rock hitting the planet?

12:36.320 --> 12:42.320
Yes, a big rock that can be metal or rock, or it can be a comet as well, mostly ice.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.400
So is that good for life or bad for life?

12:45.360 --> 12:47.760
For creating life and destroying life?

12:47.760 --> 12:54.080
Both. It's actually both. Interestingly enough, the building blocks of life,

12:54.640 --> 12:59.680
the bricks, the stuff we are made of, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen and phosphorus,

13:00.320 --> 13:07.680
they were included on our planet. They were built in just because our planet is made of

13:07.680 --> 13:13.840
these kind of rocks, asteroids and comets coming together by what we call accretion. So they were

13:13.840 --> 13:20.560
built in. When an asteroid comes, there is a lot of destruction going on. But at the same time,

13:21.200 --> 13:28.160
those rocks, they bring with them those bricks of life and they create lots of energy.

13:29.280 --> 13:38.160
If the environment around is favorable, you might possibly have some sitting going on. That's one of

13:38.160 --> 13:44.160
the aspects of what we call panspermia, which is the fact that comets and asteroids have the

13:44.160 --> 13:50.240
building blocks of life embedded in them and that given favorable conditions, they might be able to

13:50.240 --> 13:55.840
see planets. This is a theory. What percent of you, when you're looking up at the stars and

13:55.840 --> 14:02.560
wondering about this stuff, thinks that panspermia is what happened on Mars or on Earth,

14:03.280 --> 14:06.960
which is the building blocks of life came from elsewhere?

14:07.760 --> 14:13.440
That's the thing. Panspermia is a vector, potential vector, which means that it actually

14:13.440 --> 14:20.240
distributes the stuff of life left and right, but it doesn't explain the origin of life. It's not

14:20.240 --> 14:26.960
the environment itself. It just promotes maybe, and we still have to prove this. But what we know

14:26.960 --> 14:33.280
is that the stuff we are made of is very abundant all over the place, including in interstellar

14:33.840 --> 14:42.240
medium. It's all over. The idea is that maybe it just waits to have the proper environment,

14:42.240 --> 14:47.920
and we know what it needs here on Earth. It needs water. It needs energy, shelter, and nutrients.

14:48.960 --> 14:58.320
You're fundamentally interested in the origin of life and the big leaps in evolutionary history

14:58.320 --> 15:03.200
that could be like an origin of something, origin of eukaryotes, origin of

15:04.000 --> 15:09.360
photosynthesis, origin of whatever. I just think if we're a civilization here on Earth and we

15:09.360 --> 15:15.360
survive another few hundred years, I think it would be a good idea to take a big gun

15:15.360 --> 15:20.240
and just shoot life out there, like a life gun, basically try to create panspermia.

15:20.240 --> 15:27.120
That's a good backup solution. One way is to actually copy our brains and actual humans,

15:27.120 --> 15:34.480
some complex information, and send it out there. Another way to preserve life is just to send the

15:34.480 --> 15:40.800
basic building blocks, send a bunch of bacteria, a bunch of whatever the rugged organisms are on

15:40.800 --> 15:45.040
Earth. Just send a bunch of those. These are not the building blocks. They are actual organisms.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.480
Isn't that a nice shortcut? Because you said building blocks are everywhere.

15:50.800 --> 15:59.040
The bricks of life, the carbon, nitrogen, etc., they were produced by the death of previous stars.

15:59.040 --> 16:06.240
This is how they were produced. Stars like our Sun started to form 10 billion years ago.

16:06.960 --> 16:13.840
That doesn't mean that the Sun is the only kind of star that produced life or enabled

16:14.640 --> 16:21.120
life, but actually was produced 10 billion years ago. What you're talking about is a little

16:21.120 --> 16:31.120
different. Right now, there are many efforts to do the type of thing you are talking about,

16:31.120 --> 16:37.200
which is to put our DNA on whatever kind of substrate and preserve it in vaults,

16:37.200 --> 16:42.720
either in different places on Earth or on the Moon. Some people are already thinking

16:42.720 --> 16:51.200
about putting DNA on the Moon. As far as brains are concerned, it's drawing towards transhumanism,

16:51.200 --> 16:57.760
which is the enhancement of who we are through AI and machine learning. Of course,

16:57.760 --> 17:04.240
having backups is a good thing. For me, I would say that taking care of our planets and going

17:04.240 --> 17:10.800
back to a place where we are in equilibrium with our environment would be also maybe the best backup

17:10.800 --> 17:18.320
possible and let evolution do its things. Right now, we are like teenagers with enough brain to

17:18.320 --> 17:24.880
create cool tools, but we don't have enough brain to understand yet the consequences of what we are

17:24.880 --> 17:32.720
doing. Right now, we are paying for this. The question is whether we are going to be able to

17:32.720 --> 17:40.880
move forward and learn from the mistakes we are making to become a mature civilization.

17:41.680 --> 17:46.800
You probably heard of the Drake equation. That would be the L at the very end,

17:46.800 --> 17:50.320
the duration. The duration of intelligent civilization.

17:50.320 --> 17:59.600
Exactly, or at least the length of time a civilization remains detectable. It can

17:59.600 --> 18:04.240
disappear from the radar screen literally for a number of reasons. The first one is

18:05.360 --> 18:15.200
destroyed itself or being destroyed by external events, or it can become so in tune with the

18:15.200 --> 18:20.560
universe and so advanced that it disappears because it melts really in the background

18:20.560 --> 18:26.160
and it's not visible anymore. There are some wild theories out there saying that

18:26.320 --> 18:33.120
a civilization might be so advanced that you cannot distinguish them from physical processes.

18:34.720 --> 18:38.000
That was an example. It doesn't say that this is the case, but some people say,

18:38.000 --> 18:45.200
imagine that in fact all the dark matter that we see or we theorized about is in fact some sort of

18:45.200 --> 18:53.520
a biological process. You can think about a number of things. Personally, I believe that

18:53.520 --> 19:00.720
what you talk about preserving our information is kind of what life does. We need to look at

19:00.720 --> 19:09.200
ourselves as not different of what the little self that started off was. This is what tells

19:09.200 --> 19:13.840
you not about the origin of life, but in fact the nature of life, which is a lot more interesting

19:13.840 --> 19:19.920
to me because the nature of life is really what is going to give you some universal

19:20.880 --> 19:27.360
signature to look for it all over the place and not only around ponds of water for life as we know

19:27.360 --> 19:36.560
it, but the nature of life is telling you that life wants to get the most information possible

19:36.560 --> 19:43.840
around its surroundings and complexity is in fact the ability to gather and exchange

19:44.080 --> 19:51.600
preserve the most information possible. What you're saying is kind of preserving the kind

19:51.600 --> 20:02.640
of information we have. In the things that we are doing, as life happened, and I say happened

20:02.640 --> 20:08.320
because we don't know what life is, we have 123 definitions of life and some people are saying

20:08.320 --> 20:15.680
we don't have any definition, we only have descriptions of life. That's true. Think about

20:15.680 --> 20:20.160
it for two minutes. We are looking for something we don't know it is, but we have a few clues

20:20.160 --> 20:25.520
about the nature of life. There are some really good theories. The first one was Schrodinger

20:25.520 --> 20:32.240
right in the 40s. Right now there is a guy named Jeremy England. It's another biophysical theory

20:32.240 --> 20:41.600
of life. It says life is the inevitable result of thermophysics. This is the best way to beat

20:41.600 --> 20:48.000
entropy, to fight entropy, but when you look at what we are doing, if you want to know what the

20:48.000 --> 20:53.680
nature of life is, look at our languages and they can be very different languages, but they all have

20:53.680 --> 21:01.680
the same purpose, right? Exchange information, understand, store information, and also whether

21:01.680 --> 21:08.640
it is with somebody at the outside or thoughts in yourself. That's the same thing the cell was

21:08.640 --> 21:17.120
doing, but now when you're looking at life and at the structure of our languages, life started with

21:17.120 --> 21:24.640
an atom, so it's an atom. They got together to create inorganic molecules, then you have complex

21:24.640 --> 21:31.680
inorganic molecules, then you get to organic molecules, complex inorganic molecules,

21:31.680 --> 21:38.000
and then you have RNA, DNA, etc. Look at the structure of our language. We created alphabets,

21:38.800 --> 21:44.640
letters. That's your atom. Then we put them together to create syllables,

21:45.360 --> 21:52.080
right? The syllables get together to create words. Words tell you something, but they are nothing

21:52.080 --> 21:58.960
without a verb that gives the direction. That's RNA and DNA, and then you can put all the

21:58.960 --> 22:05.920
complements you want. Our languages are built exactly as life is built. We are repeating

22:05.920 --> 22:11.760
patterns. I call this the Mandelbrot universe and the fractal universe because this is exactly what

22:11.760 --> 22:19.120
it is. I would say that as much as I do believe in sending probes to explore the universe,

22:19.120 --> 22:26.720
I say we should also look inward to find the answer to some of the profound questions of who

22:26.720 --> 22:30.960
we are, what's life, what's the nature of life, because we are expressing life.

22:30.960 --> 22:35.680
CB So searching not for life, but for the nature of life.

22:35.680 --> 22:40.240
LR The nature of life, absolutely. I am more interested in that because the day we understand

22:40.880 --> 22:48.800
the nature of life, then we have a universal biosignature. It doesn't matter whether this

22:48.800 --> 22:55.840
life responds to the same kind of biochemical processes as we do, although it makes sense.

22:55.840 --> 23:02.160
I told you about the generational aspect of the bricks of life, the stuff we are made of.

23:02.160 --> 23:07.920
The sun is part of the youngest generation of stars. The first two generations of stars didn't

23:07.920 --> 23:16.960
produce the kind of elements we are made of. They were stars that were either without metal,

23:16.960 --> 23:27.600
just made of helium and hydrogen, or poor in metals. The stars died off and stars like the

23:27.600 --> 23:36.720
sun were born from those. This is why we have elements like carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc. now.

23:38.400 --> 23:44.960
That's the life we are built on. I think it's not stupid to be looking for something that looks

23:44.960 --> 23:48.560
like us because right now in the universe, this is the stuff that's the most abundant.

23:49.120 --> 23:56.960
We see with the exoplanet, with Kepler, with TESS, and now with James Webb, we see that there are

23:56.960 --> 24:02.000
many, many different types of planets that may be habitable in the habitable zone of their stars.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
There are countless stars like the sun, but more interestingly enough, there are other types of

24:08.080 --> 24:13.920
stars where you do have habitable zone as well and where the duration of the stars

24:14.880 --> 24:22.080
sometimes a thousand times more than our sun. You can imagine all sorts of things and you can

24:22.080 --> 24:29.600
imagine what type of life would be around those stars. The biochemistry might be quite similar,

24:29.600 --> 24:35.200
in fact, and especially for the simple life because simple life starts really quickly

24:36.080 --> 24:41.040
on earth. My take on this is that the universe is full of cyanobacteria,

24:41.040 --> 24:49.360
but as far as intelligent life, it takes more time. That can take a different aspect.

24:49.920 --> 24:57.280
You think it's possible that the universe is full of bacteria and even those stars that last a

24:57.280 --> 25:08.640
thousand times longer than the sun, even on the planets that orbit those stars may be bacteria

25:10.400 --> 25:13.040
for billions and billions and billions of years.

25:13.600 --> 25:18.560
We actually don't know what triggered the evolution to complexity on earth.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.080
That's still a big question, Marc.

25:20.080 --> 25:23.280
Is that the most impressive invention on earth to you?

25:23.280 --> 25:30.320
That Cambrian revolution is really what took us towards what we are. In the meantime,

25:30.320 --> 25:35.040
there were the dinosaurs, etc. The dinosaurs were wiped out, so the evolution could have taken a

25:35.040 --> 25:40.400
completely different turn. It's always, I would say, mass extinction that are going to drive

25:41.040 --> 25:51.920
what's the end game. You take two planets and you change those asteroid impacts or those big

25:51.920 --> 26:02.320
geological events that wipe out 90% of life at any time. The thing that seems to be interesting,

26:02.320 --> 26:09.440
there are two things. The first one is where you are located on our galaxy matters a lot.

26:10.720 --> 26:17.760
We actually are in the habitable zone of our galaxy. If you are too close to the center,

26:18.320 --> 26:26.320
it's a lot denser. Remember, we have the Oort cloud around our solar system. If you are in

26:26.320 --> 26:32.880
the region of the galaxy that's too populated, then you are going to run gravitational interaction

26:32.880 --> 26:40.240
with all these stars. Since it's more dense, you will have more of the comets that are living

26:40.240 --> 26:47.040
in the Oort cloud being ejected from the Oort cloud and coming towards the inner solar system.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.440
Collide with planets. You will have more of these impacts if you are too close to the center of the

26:53.440 --> 26:59.360
galaxy. Not to mention the radiation. There is a place in our galaxy where it's a really bad

26:59.360 --> 27:04.960
neighborhood. You don't want to be there. You wouldn't be able to have life. What really matters

27:04.960 --> 27:16.880
is extinctions, but also the climate history of a planet has a role to play. It seems

27:17.680 --> 27:24.480
that it's a theory. It still has to be backed up by more observation, but there is a good correlation

27:25.360 --> 27:31.120
between not only the passage of the solar system towards the center of the galaxy. There is one

27:31.120 --> 27:35.760
place where we get hit by asteroids because of the interaction I was telling you about.

27:36.720 --> 27:44.400
The other one is the climate. With the Milankovitch cycles, big jumps in life's evolution

27:44.400 --> 27:55.280
seem to be associated with Snowball Earth episodes. We don't know why yet. Snowball

27:55.280 --> 28:02.960
episodes, intuitively you would think that they are connected to a decrease in life because the

28:02.960 --> 28:10.000
whole Earth is covered in ice. But for some reason, there were big jumps in evolution right after

28:10.800 --> 28:17.120
each of those episodes. Today, there are other things like why all of a sudden you have mutation

28:17.120 --> 28:23.360
that seems to be responsible for a big jump in evolution. We are not clear yet. All of those

28:23.360 --> 28:30.080
things when you're thinking about life elsewhere are going to come into play. I cannot tell you

28:30.640 --> 28:38.640
that a planet that remains habitable for much longer than the Earth will have an evolutionary

28:38.640 --> 28:44.160
path that's the same or different. It depends on extension, depends on climate, depends on

28:44.960 --> 28:48.320
whatnot. It's a little bit surreal that we're two descendants of apes.

28:51.040 --> 28:56.480
I think that some people- Try to figure out what the heck is going on. We're very biased.

28:59.520 --> 29:06.640
We're biased as humans. You're less biased as a scientist, but we still love Earth. We still

29:06.640 --> 29:13.600
don't know anything but this Earth. Even though you tried to escape from thinking of

29:13.600 --> 29:19.360
what life is, in the search for the nature of life, we're still connected to the way we understand

29:19.360 --> 29:24.480
the nature of life here on Earth. I think that it's a little different than that.

29:24.480 --> 29:32.240
We are biased when it comes to the origin of life because we are the only model we know.

29:33.200 --> 29:41.360
As I said, it makes sense because it seems that a lot of stars like the Sun

29:41.920 --> 29:47.600
appeared ten billion years ago. There are lots of worlds that really resemble the Earth,

29:48.160 --> 29:53.360
and lots of water out there, and lots of conditions that could be a repeat of what we know.

29:53.920 --> 30:01.360
We know that this biochemistry works. Again, as I mentioned, what is going to change is really

30:01.360 --> 30:08.320
the evolution of a planet, extinction, geology, et cetera. But our model is probably very abundant.

30:08.320 --> 30:12.880
I'm not saying that the end game is going to resemble us because of all these extinctions,

30:12.880 --> 30:18.400
et cetera, but this is a good bias. It's one that has the number for it.

30:19.600 --> 30:27.840
The principle of mediocrity, I think that in that case, it really applies where the Earth

30:28.400 --> 30:36.960
is representative of an abundance of other worlds. Now, of course, there can be other biochemistry.

30:36.960 --> 30:42.640
We have some examples in our own solar system. Titan might be a representative of that.

30:42.640 --> 30:48.320
We are not very clear of the kind of biochemistry that can come out of a world where you have

30:48.320 --> 30:56.640
hydrocarbon lakes and rains and things like that, but we are going there. We will learn something

30:56.640 --> 31:07.760
about this. The bias is right there. The nature of life is different. If really life is the best

31:07.760 --> 31:13.840
way the universe has to fight entropy, there is no bias there because physics is the same all

31:13.840 --> 31:18.240
across the universe. At least the universe we know. There might be other universes,

31:18.240 --> 31:24.080
but the one we know works with the same physics. If life is the best way to fight entropy,

31:25.040 --> 31:32.080
you can imagine that life permeates the entire universe. Then the question might change to

31:33.280 --> 31:40.240
flavors of ice cream. What are the flavors of complexity that this process, this nature of life

31:40.240 --> 31:47.360
leads to? There we might have bias about what complexity looks like, what beautiful complexity

31:47.360 --> 31:53.920
looks like. We look at humans that operate a certain physical scale and time scale,

31:53.920 --> 31:58.320
and we think this is intelligence. We have another problem. We don't know what life is.

31:58.320 --> 32:02.000
We don't know what intelligence is, and we don't know what consciousness is,

32:02.000 --> 32:06.960
but we are trying to tackle the big question. Do we know what complexity is also?

32:07.760 --> 32:11.040
No. I think that we have to be honest, and as a scientist,

32:11.760 --> 32:18.080
and I'm going to step back and talk about intelligence. For me, a bacteria that has

32:18.080 --> 32:25.360
survived, like cyanobacteria, that has survived just like us four billion years in one incarnation

32:25.360 --> 32:30.640
or another, and actually they are very similar to the one that they were 3.5 billion years ago,

32:30.640 --> 32:36.960
it has some intelligence about its environment. For complexity, it might be

32:36.960 --> 32:44.240
that we need to take the word literally, which is an assemblage or additional capacity to

32:45.040 --> 32:48.880
gather, collect, store information. Maybe this is something like that,

32:48.880 --> 32:51.520
or actually use that information to do something with it.

32:53.040 --> 33:00.320
But I do completely agree with you when you talk about flavor of ice cream. I think this is exactly

33:00.320 --> 33:12.320
it. I have a basic education about what physics is doing right now, and I look at quantum physics

33:12.320 --> 33:19.360
and what it says about the universe and about the connection about an atom here

33:20.000 --> 33:24.960
and an atom here, a photon here and a photon there. I am starting to put maybe

33:25.920 --> 33:32.960
wrongfully two and two together, but in my mind, and of course it's nothing until I can prove it,

33:32.960 --> 33:39.200
but in my mind, the universe is connected everywhere in all different places. So this

33:39.200 --> 33:46.880
life connection is something that, as you said, permeates the universe, and the way to find life

33:47.760 --> 33:52.400
might be very different than to look for the origins of life. I think it's a good thing to

33:52.400 --> 33:57.200
go out there and look for the origin of life somewhere else because it's the manifestation

33:57.200 --> 34:03.440
of the nature of life that all of a sudden becomes apparent, evident to our eye. But

34:05.040 --> 34:13.440
what I think would be our greatest achievement is that if we can find that process of life,

34:14.320 --> 34:18.240
because at that point, in my mind, the universe all of a sudden is going to

34:19.040 --> 34:25.920
illuminate itself with actually its living force, what I can only call a living force.

34:25.920 --> 34:32.240
To me, this is what we are looking at, a universe that becomes more and more complex with time,

34:32.800 --> 34:40.640
more and more able to gather information, and interestingly enough, why? To understand itself.

34:40.640 --> 34:45.760
So Sagan was right when he was saying, we are the universe trying to understand itself,

34:46.480 --> 34:54.800
and the more we go, the more the universe becomes alive, maybe intelligent, and maybe also conscious.

34:55.360 --> 35:01.120
Conscious, self-aware, through us. It does make me a little bit sad as a human

35:02.080 --> 35:05.760
just watching all the breakthroughs on the artificial intelligence side when

35:05.760 --> 35:12.800
applied to natural sciences, now more and more to physics, that the creatures that will solve

35:13.760 --> 35:20.240
the question of the origin of the nature of life or just the process, the nature of life,

35:20.240 --> 35:23.840
will be AI systems. It makes me a bit sad too.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.360
I don't think so.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.000
You don't think so? You think humans will?

35:28.000 --> 35:35.120
At this point in time, remember, it was behind AI. I'm not buying in the singularity thing yet.

35:35.760 --> 35:46.480
AI is not aware. AI is being built by humans. So AI is a tool, an extremely smart tool.

35:47.120 --> 35:52.160
As long as we build it, and as long as we use it as a tool, it remains a tool.

35:52.160 --> 35:58.720
And I think there is a lot of brouhaha, and of course, science fiction and movies, they don't help.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.920
Yeah, I got to push back a little bit. Yes, I agree with you for the most part,

36:01.920 --> 36:09.520
in terms of brouhaha and sci-fi. But there is, like in the work of DeepMind,

36:10.080 --> 36:16.000
we can look at chess or we can look at protein folding. So chess is a simple one to first look at.

36:17.760 --> 36:25.840
What AlphaZero, which is their game playing engine, was able to discover and I'll stockfish

36:25.840 --> 36:34.240
about chess humbles the best human players. Not just it's better than them, it comes up with ideas

36:34.240 --> 36:41.120
that the humans don't understand. And so the AI now is telling you, even though it's programmed

36:41.120 --> 36:47.680
by humans, the AI is saying like, sacrificing a pawn here is a good idea, sacrificing a queen

36:47.680 --> 36:52.640
or a bishop here is a good idea. And then you start to kind of intuit as a human why,

36:52.640 --> 36:56.800
but you don't deeply understand. And you can say that AI is not conscious,

36:56.800 --> 37:02.480
it doesn't deeply understand the way humans do, but there's still a wisdom and a depth of knowledge

37:02.480 --> 37:08.320
in that chess playing program that humans don't have. And the same with AlphaFold with protein

37:08.320 --> 37:13.840
folding. And now they're applying it to physics to simulating nuclear reactions and so on.

37:14.400 --> 37:20.160
It feels like there might be a way to understand the nature of life, that we can kind of intuit

37:20.160 --> 37:27.200
poetically as humans, but the true understanding will come from a system that's much more

37:27.200 --> 37:33.600
computationally sophisticated. Again, I would push back on my turn because I still think that

37:33.600 --> 37:41.760
humans give themselves the ability to do that by building that tool. So the idea that the tool,

37:42.880 --> 37:47.920
we are getting into the Kardashev scale and the dark forest and all these things,

37:48.720 --> 37:57.280
we can see the world this way. At this point in time, for me, I still see a great tool.

37:59.440 --> 38:07.680
Now, whether the sci-fi scenario is going to happen, et cetera, I still think that we are

38:07.680 --> 38:12.400
far away from this. But if that tool is capable of giving me a new perspective,

38:13.360 --> 38:22.400
it's just that we are starting to jump into a deeper cognition of what the universe is,

38:22.400 --> 38:27.360
whether it's through our brain or through a different way of gathering information.

38:27.360 --> 38:31.440
Remember, this is what we do. Yeah, humans are able to actually build tools

38:32.320 --> 38:38.000
and then integrate them into their way of thinking. Maybe another generation has to be born

38:38.640 --> 38:44.880
that is raised with those tools, but we seem to take for granted all the cool technologies

38:44.880 --> 38:48.960
you integrate into your way of thinking. A lot of people that are growing up now,

38:49.760 --> 38:57.200
their mind is integrated with the internet. You basically reconfigure the way you memorize things.

38:57.200 --> 39:00.560
You no longer have to memorize a lot of facts because you can look them up really quickly.

39:01.040 --> 39:08.080
And so you reallocate a lot of resources for thinking versus memory of

39:09.040 --> 39:12.800
just strict facts, that kind of stuff. And we integrate all of that.

39:14.640 --> 39:18.160
There, I would completely agree with you. In fact, I wrote about this again

39:20.240 --> 39:23.200
in this new book that's coming out. When is the book coming out?

39:23.200 --> 39:26.720
In January. It will be in French, actually, to start with.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.600
You wrote it in French? Actually, I wrote it first in English.

39:30.640 --> 39:36.080
I translated it into French, so the English version is already pretty much ready to go

39:36.080 --> 39:44.880
if we find a publisher in the US. But anyways, the point being here is that I looked at this

39:44.880 --> 39:52.960
as a relationship with technology as a complete change. To me, this is a singularity more than

39:52.960 --> 39:59.200
anything else, which is the coevolution of humans with technology, not anymore with their

39:59.200 --> 40:04.960
environment. Why are we messing up the environment right now? Why don't we respond to pandemics the

40:04.960 --> 40:10.480
way we should? Because we are disconnected to the environment we are taking our information from and

40:10.480 --> 40:15.760
we are adapting from. Right now, exactly as you said, we take the information from the web,

40:15.760 --> 40:23.760
from the phones, etc. We have no filter over that information. Before you were out in the environment,

40:23.760 --> 40:28.720
the information you get is the one the planet is sending you. Now this information is coming from

40:28.720 --> 40:32.000
different ways. You have no way of knowing if the information is correct or not.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.640
Do I have to push back on that? No, you look at this as an ecosystem and it

40:36.640 --> 40:40.480
explains a lot of our behavior. See, I like that you said teenagers.

40:41.920 --> 40:48.800
The technology, I think, when we move past the teenager stage, enriches our ability to sense the

40:48.800 --> 40:55.440
earth, to understand what's going on with the environment. It's not that technology disconnects

40:55.440 --> 41:01.040
us from the environment. It gives us more tools with which to understand what's going on with the

41:01.040 --> 41:05.440
environment. That's true for the people who are building the tools and know how to use it. Take

41:05.440 --> 41:11.040
those tools now, put them in the general public with no filter, which is happening with social

41:11.040 --> 41:16.160
media, which is happening with a lot of things, and you see the disaster this is creating.

41:16.160 --> 41:21.200
It's not the disaster. You sound like a parent talking about a teenager. Yes,

41:21.760 --> 41:28.000
that's true. It's the growing pains of a civilization that is becoming deeply connected.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.960
We can communicate all across the world, even through the pandemic.

41:32.960 --> 41:38.000
That's the good thing about technology. This is also something I wrote. It's not the tools we

41:38.000 --> 41:43.920
create that are bad. It's the way we use them. Yes, but we are learning. This is the cool thing.

41:43.920 --> 41:49.520
Hopefully, we'll do all the learning before it's too late because our response to what's going on

41:49.520 --> 41:55.520
in the environment, our response to pandemics, is deeply connected to this disconnect we have

41:55.520 --> 42:04.480
with nature. Anyways, we all agree that we are in growing pains and hopefully we can move forward

42:04.480 --> 42:10.960
because there is a fantastic universe, something absolutely magical around us. I'm talking as a

42:10.960 --> 42:18.320
scientist. There is magic, not in the sense of trickery, but in the sense of wonder around us.

42:19.520 --> 42:30.720
There are so many signs where we are getting so close to revolutions in cosmology, in astrobiology,

42:30.720 --> 42:38.480
in astronomy, which I think to me, this is where the hope lies and also an awakening of understanding

42:38.480 --> 42:44.640
that we need to be in equilibrium with the planet if we want to move forward. Even though we have

42:44.640 --> 42:50.480
these big dreams of going on Mars and the Moon. Listen, I am a planetary geologist, so I am all

42:50.480 --> 42:57.120
for exploration. Right now, the Moon or Mars is not going to save your butt because for the logistics

42:57.120 --> 43:04.560
will still depend very much on the Earth and for a long time. I think this time we are living in

43:05.360 --> 43:15.680
will be remembered as a pivot in our history for a number of reasons. A time where there is a

43:15.680 --> 43:20.880
growing consciousness, where we are creating tools that are going a little bit ahead of us,

43:20.880 --> 43:27.920
that we have some difficult time to catch on with, where we have to deal with a population that's way

43:27.920 --> 43:35.520
too big for the planet we have. We need to really learn a sense of balance and

43:36.560 --> 43:43.120
immaturity as a civilization. How is this going to unfold? Right now, I have no clue.

43:43.920 --> 43:50.560
I draw a lot of optimism from the similar things that happened many decades ago

43:51.360 --> 43:58.480
when nuclear weapons were developed. Boy, it was that at the time even more terrifying.

43:58.480 --> 44:03.680
You just now created weapons that could destroy the entirety of life on Earth. Or not entirety,

44:03.680 --> 44:11.840
but a lot of it. We somehow found a balance. The threat constantly is out there. That threat has

44:11.840 --> 44:20.560
been made more visceral in recent times because of the war in Ukraine, but we find a balance

44:20.560 --> 44:28.400
somehow. I have a threat of optimism for human civilization that we figure it out. We're clever

44:28.400 --> 44:33.760
teenagers, I think. We are clever teenagers. There is definitely a threat of optimism,

44:33.760 --> 44:39.840
but I think it's thin. It's thin because something that has changed as well

44:40.560 --> 44:51.760
is the mentality of humans. Although the threat was terrifying when nuclear weapons were created,

44:53.600 --> 45:00.880
there was a sense of limits you were willing to push in the threats.

45:01.600 --> 45:12.640
There was a sense of decency, of moral values. It was not perfect, but it was at least a time

45:13.200 --> 45:18.080
where people could come together from very different perspectives and agree

45:18.720 --> 45:22.480
that something was more important than destroying everything.

45:23.040 --> 45:28.320
That's so hilarious you say that. Yes, you're talking about a small slither of humans,

45:28.320 --> 45:31.200
which is the scientists in the Manhattan Project, perhaps.

45:31.200 --> 45:31.760
No, absolutely not.

45:31.760 --> 45:37.600
That was also the time when over 100 million people were tortured or murdered.

45:37.600 --> 45:43.920
No, no. I agree with that. Absolutely. I'm not talking about scientists here. Actually,

45:43.920 --> 45:50.000
I'm talking about politicians. We've gone beyond that point now. This is what I'm worried about.

45:51.920 --> 45:58.240
Torture, et cetera. Unfortunately, we are apes, exactly what you said. I think that there is

45:58.240 --> 46:04.720
a lot to be... Not to blame grandpa for that, but because we can always get better.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.000
Grandpa was a wild man.

46:08.000 --> 46:13.520
But we have to improve a lot on that side before we can claim that we are a mature civilization.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.120
Because you mentioned the magic. When you look out there,

46:18.240 --> 46:20.160
perhaps it's not a scientific question, but...

46:21.520 --> 46:23.440
You don't have to be scientific all the time.

46:24.400 --> 46:29.360
You said magic. There's a magic to magic that is in part scientific and in part,

46:30.160 --> 46:34.320
I don't know, whatever fills us with awe as humans when we look up at the stars.

46:35.040 --> 46:41.120
Do you think the universe is full of life or not? When you're sitting,

46:41.120 --> 46:45.360
drinking some wine, looking up at the stars and wandering as a human,

46:46.640 --> 46:53.040
do you think we're alone or do you think life is everywhere?

46:53.120 --> 46:59.360
I am going to make such an unmagical response to that. My response is,

47:00.000 --> 47:07.920
that's the scientific response, that if we are alone, then the universe is a statistical absurdity.

47:11.200 --> 47:16.720
I have no doubt in my mind, and that is an unscientific response as well,

47:16.720 --> 47:21.120
but I have no doubt in my mind that the universe is teeming with life.

47:21.920 --> 47:25.360
What if it keeps dying?

47:26.720 --> 47:29.840
This is what life does, unfortunately.

47:33.200 --> 47:38.640
That extinction, as a process, as a part of the process of life,

47:39.280 --> 47:44.240
extinction seems to be a fundamental, both negative and positive, component.

47:45.200 --> 47:51.200
So what if all the complex life out there just keeps dying and not making way for...

47:52.080 --> 47:59.280
We're actually a statistical anomaly in us being able to survive that L in the Drake equation,

47:59.280 --> 48:05.520
being able to survive long enough to form complex organisms of the kind like mammals are,

48:05.520 --> 48:07.760
things with brains, things that are able to accomplish that.

48:07.760 --> 48:14.720
L is not about that. L is about how long a civilization is capable of being detectable,

48:14.720 --> 48:18.160
which means that rich technologies and being detectable.

48:18.160 --> 48:21.760
Okay. So there's more nuanced things to L because you can have intelligent civilizations

48:21.760 --> 48:24.640
that are not very detectable. Yeah. We had civilization

48:25.280 --> 48:32.640
for thousands of years. We started to be detectable 150 years ago. So it's about technology,

48:32.640 --> 48:40.160
technology that we can actually capture from space. You become visible to your neighbors,

48:41.760 --> 48:48.320
and this is all about the Fermi paradox. It takes time, obviously, if we're taking again

48:48.320 --> 48:54.800
ourselves as a model, but this is the only one we have, to get to the point where we become

48:54.800 --> 49:01.440
detectable. But look at the age of the universe, even if life as we understand it,

49:02.480 --> 49:07.360
not saying even as we know it, but as we can understand it, started 10 billion years ago.

49:08.320 --> 49:15.280
It takes 4 billion years to get to the point where it becomes detectable. That means that

49:15.280 --> 49:20.560
the first planet where those civilizations started off starting to be detectable when we were still

49:20.560 --> 49:27.120
cyanobacteria in ponds. So they were throwing messages that were passing above our heads

49:27.120 --> 49:32.720
at that point. Those civilizations, when you look at them now, close to 10 billion years

49:33.280 --> 49:41.760
after the start, so their son would be dead. In the best-case scenario, they move somewhere else,

49:41.760 --> 49:50.000
and what that means is that civilizations are going to rise, die, or move, and transform

49:50.000 --> 49:56.240
themselves. We can see ourselves changing. We know that humans are still changing as a species.

49:56.240 --> 50:03.520
The human being in 1,000 or even 500 years from now might not be looking a lot like we are doing

50:03.520 --> 50:09.840
right now. Who knows where we will be? We might be migrating into our planetary system. We might

50:09.840 --> 50:14.640
be migrating somewhere else. Well, you said migrating, but it seems when you look at life,

50:14.640 --> 50:24.000
it doesn't necessarily migrate. It expands. So it's not or place A or place B. It's place A

50:24.000 --> 50:30.480
and place B. It seems to expand. It could be. We are talking about the human civilization here,

50:31.440 --> 50:37.520
so there are different factors. If you are a cyanobacteria or any type of even a mammal

50:37.520 --> 50:43.840
that doesn't have the technology to escape the planet we were born on, then it's plan A.

50:44.560 --> 50:49.200
It's right there. Whatever happens to your planet, you are tied to it. You cannot escape it.

50:50.160 --> 50:56.400
For humans, it's a little different. Yeah, it's A and B or whatever we can.

50:57.840 --> 51:05.200
We have to expect that a number of the extraterrestrial civilizations that might

51:05.200 --> 51:10.240
be technologically advanced, a number of them will have disappeared just because they run the course

51:10.240 --> 51:19.600
of their evolution or because their sun run out of fuel and they didn't have a way to escape

51:19.600 --> 51:26.400
or they were wiped out by any kind of event. Then there will be those that survive.

51:26.400 --> 51:31.680
Everything I've seen from life, it seems obvious that there's life everywhere out there.

51:32.480 --> 51:39.840
In fact, maybe I don't understand the jump from bacteria enough, but it seems obvious

51:39.840 --> 51:46.480
that there's intelligent civilizations out there. Now, I don't know how to define intelligence,

51:46.480 --> 51:53.760
but there's beautiful complexity. I've looked at enough cellular automata, which is a very

51:53.760 --> 52:01.520
primitive mathematical construction that when you run, complexity emerges. I've looked at that

52:01.520 --> 52:06.960
enough to know that it just seems like there's complexity everywhere out there. That's why I'm

52:06.960 --> 52:15.120
deeply puzzled by the Fermi paradox. It makes no sense to me. I have trivial answers to it. Why

52:15.120 --> 52:24.560
haven't aliens at scale not shown up? I think the two possible options for me is either we're too

52:24.560 --> 52:28.800
dumb to see it. They're already here. They've been talking to us through processes we just

52:28.800 --> 52:36.560
don't understand. What we experience as life here on earth is actually they're everywhere.

52:36.560 --> 52:41.760
Aliens could be consciousness. When we feel love for one another, that could be aliens.

52:43.360 --> 52:48.800
Feel fear or whatever. That could be aliens. I have to agree with you. None of this is

52:48.800 --> 52:54.880
scientifically provable right now. We talked a little bit already about that. I would say

52:54.880 --> 53:04.480
that I do not adhere to the Fermi paradox because it's very anthropomorphic. It's an

53:04.480 --> 53:11.440
interesting exercise, let's put it that way. But it's a typical example of seeing the universe

53:11.440 --> 53:20.960
through our own eyes. This is where the limitation is. Understanding what's going on with complexity,

53:20.960 --> 53:26.640
as you said, and looking at the biophysical model and theories for the nature of life,

53:27.200 --> 53:33.040
I would agree that probably this extraterrestrial message is all around us.

53:33.600 --> 53:39.520
We're not yet capable of picking it up. But I think, unfortunately, even though that makes

53:39.520 --> 53:44.160
me sad, the way to pick it up is by studying life here on earth, doing some of the science you're

53:44.160 --> 53:52.400
doing, better understand the nature of life until you realize, holy crap, the thing I was looking

53:52.400 --> 53:57.280
for all along has been here all along. Well, you know, a good example of that,

53:57.280 --> 54:04.720
and it doesn't need to be an extraterrestrial civilization. Look at something that I really…

54:05.440 --> 54:11.200
Whether or not it's real, I don't care because in terms of intellectual exercise,

54:11.200 --> 54:18.960
I think it's fantastic. Look at the shadow biosphere. The idea that life didn't appear

54:19.920 --> 54:29.840
only once on earth, but there were many different pathways of it. Today, we know when we study

54:31.120 --> 54:40.320
the tree of life that led to us, from Luca to us, and the shadow biosphere is telling

54:40.560 --> 54:49.760
us that there are other pathways that came up at the time where life originated,

54:49.760 --> 54:58.960
but they are so different that we cannot recognize them as being living. We cannot pick them up in

54:58.960 --> 55:06.800
our test because our tests are being built to recognize life as we know it. For me, again,

55:06.800 --> 55:16.000
I don't know if this theory will be verified or it would be discredited, but what I like about it

55:16.000 --> 55:21.600
is that it forces me to think on how do I look for life? I don't know.

55:22.960 --> 55:31.600
So that starts here on our planet, not even with little green men. It starts with very simple life

55:31.600 --> 55:38.480
that can be so different that it might be just right in front of our nose and we don't see it.

55:38.480 --> 55:42.080
So that probably starts with the scientific humility of

55:44.400 --> 55:49.840
realizing that we might be too biased in our understanding of what is the phenomena we're

55:49.840 --> 55:54.320
trying to study. Yeah, I don't like the term bias because it involves some moral connotation.

55:55.280 --> 56:01.840
But I understand the bias in terms of scientific pathway, intellectual framework, definitely.

56:01.840 --> 56:10.560
What do you think about the UFO sightings, so the widespread experiences that people have in seeing

56:11.200 --> 56:19.280
different phenomena that are mysterious, that people project ideas about whether it's aliens

56:19.280 --> 56:23.920
or not, but they can't explain it, and there's pictures and data, and then the government is

56:23.920 --> 56:29.680
involved in releasing footage and all that kind of stuff, and that it seems to captivate the public.

56:31.120 --> 56:38.400
It always do. There are a number of things that captivate people, especially children, actually,

56:38.400 --> 56:39.760
dinosaurs and aliens.

56:39.760 --> 56:40.640
Still a child.

56:40.640 --> 56:47.600
Yeah, we are also a child at heart. So about UFOs, I am a scientist and I'm a citizen,

56:47.600 --> 56:52.640
so I'm going to tell you a couple of things. First, I don't mind talking about that at all

56:52.640 --> 56:57.680
because I think as a scientist, this is extremely interesting because the thing I don't know,

56:58.320 --> 57:00.720
I want to learn about it. This is more knowledge.

57:01.840 --> 57:09.520
We all know the statistics about UFOs. 95% of them are just natural phenomenon or things that

57:09.520 --> 57:16.080
are being misinterpreted. We know that. Then you have the 2% that might be secret programs

57:16.080 --> 57:23.360
by whatever government is out there. Another percent, say, is about natural phenomenon

57:23.360 --> 57:29.360
that we don't know about yet and we cannot explain. Then there is this tiny percentage

57:29.360 --> 57:35.120
that don't fall into all these categories of things. I think that the report about the UAPs

57:35.120 --> 57:42.400
falls into the same kind of scheme except that now they have at least some patterns of speed

57:42.400 --> 57:45.360
of other things that were in the report.

57:46.080 --> 57:57.840
Today, we don't know if these sightings are part of military program or actual UFOs. I always run

57:57.840 --> 58:02.000
into that question because, of course, as the director of the Carl Sagan Center at the study

58:02.000 --> 58:07.840
institute, I received a number of emails about the subject. People are actually confused about

58:07.840 --> 58:15.120
what the study institute is. We are not studying UFOs. We are actually looking for messages. The

58:15.120 --> 58:21.680
way I put it usually is that we are studying extraterrestrials in their natural habitat.

58:23.360 --> 58:28.400
The UFO people are trying to understand whether they invaded our aerial space.

58:29.040 --> 58:36.480
This is two very different things. Unfortunately, over the years, I actually respect very much

58:36.480 --> 58:43.680
people who are trying to go to the bottom of what UFOs are following some very

58:44.800 --> 58:50.560
scientific ways of doing this. There are very credible agencies doing this. Unfortunately,

58:50.560 --> 59:00.080
there is a folklore around UFOs. This has been a huge disservice to the scientific community.

59:00.080 --> 59:05.600
This is why you have been having that much pushback for a long time by the scientific community

59:05.600 --> 59:12.480
because no congressman in the world wants to tell their taxpayer that they are supporting something

59:12.480 --> 59:19.440
that's looking for flying saucers. When you see what's happening, it's terrifying. I am actually

59:20.080 --> 59:30.800
concerned about that relationship that people do between folklore and real search for extraterrestrials

59:30.800 --> 59:40.720
and intelligence. In fact, it's been so bad that until today, there is no government agency that is

59:40.720 --> 59:48.640
actually funding the city search. It is a private funded endeavor. What NASA funds right now,

59:48.640 --> 59:53.280
which is a progress, is a search for technosignature, which means that when you are looking

59:53.840 --> 59:58.880
at the atmosphere of a planet, you look for some disequilibrium that could tell you that something

59:58.880 --> 01:00:08.880
is there. But it's not going to fund an institute or whatnot that is looking for messages or other

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.640
things like that. Does that just have to do with the taboo associated with the folklore?

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:21.360
Yes. I think there was a pushback from the political arena decades ago about that, at the time

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:30.000
where all the flying saucers were coming out, and then the said institute got started. But now,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.640
there is more of a willingness to look at the UAP, UFO, phenomenon from a scientific standpoint,

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:47.200
so much so that the government is actually seeking some help from a scientific institution,

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:55.280
and there are programs to start looking into those phenomena. As a scientist, I am interested.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:01.520
What I'm not interested in, again, Carl Sagan comes back here. I don't want to believe. I want

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.880
to know. To know, you have to have real experiments, you have to have observation,

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:15.520
and you have things that are done the right way. I don't want to have somebody that starts with

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:22.000
what if as a question and then turns this what if into the only argument and the only conclusion

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.280
there is. You understand what I'm saying? But still, I think it's valuable to appreciate

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.960
the mystery and not deny the mystery. The mystery is there, but what I don't want is

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:38.320
people taking advantage of the public and making money out of folklore. Let me flip that. I

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:45.440
understand. There is a folklore in the stuff I do, AI and robotics, for example. There's a clear fear

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:51.600
terminator in movies and all those kind of stuff. You could say that I'm very concerned about this

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:58.480
miscalibrated understanding of the public of what robots' role are in society. Or you could see it

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.880
as a, let's use a metaphor of a wave. You can say this giant wave that we'll call folklore is a

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.840
really bad idea. We need to avoid it. We need to hide. We need to build dams. Or you can be a

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:17.280
surfer and ride the wave as a scientist. To me, the fact that people are wondering about the mystery

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:24.640
of UFOs, it means they're wondering. No, they are. But the thing, I will stop surfing that wave when

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.600
it comes back to bite an entire scientific discipline. When it hurts the science, sure.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:37.600
For now, the past 60 years, we were not able to raise money from the government, no grants.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:45.360
It's a discipline that has no postdoc or very little postdoc just because there is a fear

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.600
of that folklore on the political arena. People don't want to be associated with that because

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:59.440
they confuse the two. So I stop there. As the director of the Carl Sagan Center, I am just

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:06.560
very happy to see now that there is a course correction in the government seeking scientific

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:13.360
investigators for these kinds of issues. Hopefully, that will right the ship there.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:18.480
I love it. I love to see it. I love our little disagreements. I'm doing so, obviously,

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:25.840
respectfully and with love. It makes for a fun conversation. But I think, just like with surfing

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:31.120
a wave, there's some level of, the more you resist it, the worse it is.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.520
So we didn't resist it. It didn't come from us and we pay the price.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:47.520
I just think that the role of a scientist in part in the 21st century, when we talk about social

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:55.200
media, is to direct this sense of wonder that people have into a direction of the rigors of

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.680
science. I think we do that pretty well. I would disagree. I don't think so.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:03.440
SETI does much better, but there's other places in science where-

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.320
The search for life is a fairly easy place to draw the wonder of people.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:08.640
Yes, 100%.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.800
Because it's a profound question that pretty much everybody has.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.800
I just want to highlight the fact that I think a lot of scientists, my colleagues, friends,

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.880
think that all you need to do is science. All you need to do is the scientific process,

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:30.560
the peer review process, the data, and so on. But I think communication is actually a fundamental

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:37.680
part of the process. It has to do with funding, but it also has to do with where a bunch of humans

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.800
trying to ask big questions, trying to figure this whole puzzle out.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:47.440
I totally agree. We do have more public presentation at the institute than peer reviewed

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:52.880
articles. And believe me, we have lots of peer reviewed articles. So our scientists are out there

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:58.960
and they are sharing the wonder of discoveries. And it's so easy these days. There is not one day.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:04.080
Tell me about writing a book right now about the search for life in the universe. It's almost

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:09.120
every single day I had to correct something in the chapters I was writing.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:14.560
So SETI, in terms of both signatures and signals, is a pretty active field.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:20.400
So it's getting better right now. It's getting better. But remember that the SETI Institute

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:26.480
is not only about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. This is the historical route of the

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:32.560
institute. But it's about 10% of what we do. In fact, we are searching for life in the universe

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:38.160
from the origins of life to extraterrestrial intelligence. So 90% of everything else is

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:47.280
exoplanet. For instance, we have a good chunk of the Capri team that is actually with the SETI

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:52.560
Institute. And they are working with TESS right now. Some already have some time on the GEMS web.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:59.120
We have astrobiologists. We have astronomers. And those are looking for data, for signals,

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.880
for planets out there outside of our solar system. Yeah. Go to analog places to try and understand

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:11.040
the type of life that survive in planetary type environments. I mean, people are always surprised

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:18.080
when I tell them whatever flies in the solar system has flown or will be flying,

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.880
we are involved. So this is not something that pops in everybody's mind when they are thinking

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:31.520
about the SETI Institute because we started off as the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:37.120
But the institute has really bloomed into the search for life along the Drake equation,

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:41.040
all the terms of the Drake equation. Just to clarify, because by the way,

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.840
you're saying a bunch of terms sometimes, it's good to return to the basics. When you're saying

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:53.280
whatever's flown, SETI is a part of the things that are flown. So we, because we're using

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:59.840
we elucid sometimes to say we humans and sometimes we SETI. So the SETI is really broadly involved

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.040
in a lot of the fingertips reaching out there towards the stars. Think about Mars involved

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.440
in landing site selection, in instruments that are actually on board, some of the mission in

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:17.040
science teams, for instance, Cassini, New Horizons, also missions that will be coming.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:25.520
The search for life, we do this all across the Drake equation. So SETI is part of it and it's

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:32.080
our route and it's expanding a little bit right now. We hope it will continue to expand. So this

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:39.680
is a good time for the Institute. It also, in my mind, was the very first Astrobiology Institute

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:46.400
because we have this multidisciplinary approach where I can bring many of the scientists from

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:52.880
different domains and disciplines to think about the question. As you know, discoveries happen at

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:58.560
the nexus of disciplines. It's really a privilege when you are in an Institute like that.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:06.240
You've dived in volcanic lakes at high altitudes to study the creatures within. Can you tell me the

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:10.000
technical, the fun, the human story of that effort?

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.760
The image that is associated with the scientist is the person with the white coat in the lab.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:24.640
In fact, a number of us at the Institute are athletes doing what would be considered extreme

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:32.800
stuff. It's fun. It's a little dangerous too, but it's to get data and more knowledge.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.760
There are so many stories. I don't even know where-

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.400
When was the first time you did a dangerous thing with a volcano?

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:51.120
The first one associated to the search for life, understanding, was in 2002 where I started climbing

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:57.120
those high volcanoes in the Andes that are 20,000 footers. The view out there is just beautiful.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:08.080
You're so hilarious at spending almost no time on some epic things. I love this. How tall are

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:12.000
these volcanoes? What are you doing with a volcano? What's required to prepare for that?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.280
What does a mission like that look like? That is true. This is science embodied. It's like

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.080
athletics and science. You're studying the extreme conditions of life on Earth,

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:31.040
extreme beauty of life on Earth in those conditions. What are we talking about with this volcano?

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.960
Remember when we were talking about how do I understand how I search for life on Mars?

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.400
This is how it started for me. Then I looked at the environment. In my head, I started going

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:48.480
through the environment on Earth. That would be good analysis. Then you only have a few.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:55.520
The Andes, in that case, are some of the best in the world just because of the aridity of the place.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:04.960
The higher you go, the least atmosphere you have, the more UV radiation you have. The Andes are

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.240
volcanic, hydrothermal, plus you have the climate change that's coming. You have evaporation.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:18.960
It's a picture of Mars 3.5 billion years ago. Now you are actually entering a time machine,

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:31.600
basically. Remember I'm a diver. The first time I got in 2002 to the places we wanted to explore,

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:39.120
all of a sudden I was standing at 14,000 feet, looking at 20,000 feet and saying,

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:44.320
okay, well, I need to get up there. Are you scared?

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:50.960
No, no, because we are prepared. The only thing I didn't know is if I was going to be able to make

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.440
it to the top because now you're dealing with high altitude. You can deal with high altitude sickness.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.200
You can deal with a number of things. For God's sake, these are volcanoes and they are dormant.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:04.160
They are not extinct. That can bite us a couple of times.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.320
What was your preparation for that kind of thing?

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:13.200
There is a lot of hiking and trekking at high altitude around here, but not so high because

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:21.280
we don't have anything closer to those elevations around here in the US. But in volcanic environment,

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:26.400
climbing volcanoes here, we have plenty of those. Diving as well. I am a free diver,

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:33.120
so this is where it's going to be hilarious because I started with a completely rational fear

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:41.200
of pressurized vessels that comes from an incident in my childhood. I became a free diver to avoid

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:47.360
having to carry oxygen tanks on my back. Free diving is diving without anything,

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.120
just your lungs. That started from childhood.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:58.320
It was to the point where when I saw a pressurized vessel like a methane tank or anything,

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:04.480
I would be going around and put a lot of distance between me and that tank.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.680
I was not going to carry any oxygen tank. The first time I actually dived at the

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:18.000
summit of that lake was free diving. People look at me like I'm nuts. Well, maybe I am a little bit.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.360
People that work with you as well? That seems kind of nuts.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.400
No. It's a risk.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:31.840
Actually, it's a lot less of a risk than getting with conventional air, and I can explain that.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:41.120
But ultimately, what decided me to certify scuba and go over my fear was that as a scientist,

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:48.080
I needed more time at the bottom of the lake to sample rationally, take my time to think,

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:55.280
and I can stay quite long enough as a free diver underwater.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:02.160
But the last thing you want to do at 20,000 feet is to come up at the surface with empty lungs

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.400
because there is not much you can breathe out there to replenish your oxygen.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:14.480
So definitely, your time in the water is cut short just for safety. I realized that it was

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:22.000
not a good trade-off for me at some point. So I certified scuba, and after three years of exploring

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.280
that lake free diving, we finally came up with a full scuba diving expedition. But we were diving

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:38.880
with rebreathers, which means that we dived with pure oxygen. So rebreathers give you a bag

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:46.320
with stuff that looks like cat liters in it, which is basically to absorb the CO2

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:54.160
that you are expelling when you are breathing, and they're recycling oxygen this way. So basically,

01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:01.360
you are rebreathing your own respiration. How long can you do that? So what's interesting

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:09.280
about that technology? It's very interesting because then that completely avoids the potential

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:16.880
issues you may have with the binds when you are diving, the risk of bubbles trapped in your lungs

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:23.120
because of different pressures and different gases. So there's a complexity to the flow of

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:29.840
oxygen underwater. When you are breathing regular air, when you are scuba diving here,

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:35.520
you know that you have to do some different – when you are coming back, when you are diving deep

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:43.440
and you have conventional air, then you need to stop so that you can equalize the gases in your

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:52.000
lungs. If you come back too fast, then you can have air bubbles stuck, and then you can raise

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.480
the binds, which you can risk to be paralyzed. You can risk a number of nasty issues,

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:02.480
and we wanted absolutely to avoid that. So diving with pure oxygen avoids this completely.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:12.960
It has another benefit at high altitude is that – well, the greater risk when you are at high

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:19.440
altitude is altitude sickness. What is altitude sickness is just you not having enough oxygen in

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:26.240
your blood. So this was a good benefit. It was a good trade-off. We were lucky enough to be

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:33.600
also trained by the military, so we came up with not the civilian rebreather, which is the big

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:41.600
thing on the back that you carry on your back. We actually were given Navy SEALs, commando rebreather.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.240
You worked with Navy SEALs for this? The director of military operations,

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:53.760
yes. We were trained like astronauts for three months. I spent more time – I had a joke that

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:59.120
if somebody wanted to reach me, they better put a phone line at the bottom of the swimming pool,

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.040
because this is where I was. So we trained and we trained, and our manual about the safety was

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:12.640
about that thick. So it was a real operation. That was three years into it, because when you

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:18.320
are freediving in the years prior, there is no risk. You don't have any other gas in your lung

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:23.520
than what you are breathing. The only risk is it comes short of air, and then you are in trouble,

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.120
which happened to me one time, seriously. Tell me about that time. I got to ask you

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:34.240
about freediving before we return to the rebreather. Well, all these legs I had at altitude,

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:38.560
they are cold. They are at the minimum temperature that you can have on bodies of water,

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:43.280
clear bodies of water, which is 4°C. It's very, very cold.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:49.360
It's like an ice bath. Yeah, so you cannot

01:16:51.440 --> 01:17:03.120
just dive with a wetsuit. The idea was to take a drysuit, and I learned how to freedive with a

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.320
drysuit, which is really the worst thing you can do.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.920
What's a wetsuit? What's a drysuit?

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.760
So a drysuit, a wetsuit is usually what you use in the ocean when it's not too cold. You can use

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:19.040
also a drysuit, but the wetsuit basically is going to keep you warm because water is getting

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:25.920
into the suit, and the contact of your skin is getting to body temperature. And so for a while,

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:35.600
you can dive like that, and in the ocean here, that's fine. The drysuit is the opposite. It's

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:41.760
completely closed, which means that you don't have any contact with the water outside,

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:47.680
and you keep your warmth through your body temperature and even clothing that you can

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:54.560
put into it. So these drysuit, they are used by divers who go really deep in very cold water

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.480
and need to stay a long time underwater. So what's the bad part?

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:09.440
The bad part is that when you have those drysuit, you have a lot of air that can be trapped

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.320
in it. Usually we do what we call burping the suit. It's not a very pleasant expression, but

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.120
you get in the water, and as soon as you get in the water, you can see the air pockets all over

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:26.960
the place. So you burp the suit, you open the valve, and the air comes out. Once you have done

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.880
that, then you look with your lead belt, and you know when you are ready to go down.

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:39.600
And so what happened that day is that I actually did burp the suit, but didn't realize I burped it

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:50.640
completely. And so I went down, and immediately I felt an air pocket going to my legs. So basically,

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:57.280
air was trapped in the suit and went on my legs as I was diving like that. And so I didn't pay

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.840
too much attention to that. Because you're diving down?

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:06.880
Yeah, I was diving down. And so I didn't pay too much attention about that as I was busy,

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:16.560
just an awkward position. But then I wanted to turn and go up. Well, no can do. I was just like

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:24.400
a buoy. And I was like that. So the first time, I say, okay, I try the second time,

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.080
and the third time. And by the fourth time, I kind of realized I was in trouble. And the fifth time,

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:35.680
I say, okay, now you better give it your best try. Otherwise, it's going to be big trouble.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.040
So this is free diving?

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:39.920
I was free diving.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.920
And then you can't...

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.560
And I cannot...

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.960
What were you feeling? I mean, is there a panic or not?

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.400
No, there is no panic because you can't. You cannot afford to be panicking. In fact,

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.400
you are always thinking because there is training. This is the best part about training.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:00.560
Your training allows you that space to keep you cool and compose, which you need to be in that

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:07.600
kind of situation. And so finally, after the fifth time, I was able to rectify the position

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:15.040
and get myself up. But when I got up, my lungs were empty. I had been in the water for quite

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:23.840
some time and I knew what was going to happen. So I decided to just be the plank, not move and

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:30.640
don't do anything, just open my mouth and try to suck oxygen. But obviously oxygen at 6,000 meters,

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:38.240
20,000 feet, there is not that much. It's about a little... It's 48% of what you breathe at sea

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:49.040
level. So although it was noon at that time, the sky stayed pretty dark and starry for about a

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.800
minute or two. Oh my God, yes. The funny thing was...

01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.080
And that's the first time you experienced that kind of... I mean, can you possibly train for

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.680
that? Can you also pass out? Oh, you could. I mean, the fact that I was

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:14.400
already seeing dark was a real sign that my brain was starved of oxygen. And I had one of my friends

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:20.160
or colleagues on the shore just telling me, because I'd been under for a little while and say,

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:26.720
is everything okay? And I remember trying to say something and I was just like,

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:32.480
that's I think the best lie I ever, ever. I get the thumbs up.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.480
You were lying to the friend and maybe to yourself?

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.880
No, because I knew I was going to be okay, but it took me to be still for a few minutes.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:46.560
Well, can you talk about freediving? I mean, what's the technical skill involved here? It

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:52.640
just seems exceptionally difficult. For most people that swim, you go underwater,

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.320
it's hard. So what's the skill there?

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:03.680
You know, I think you probably can get good or better at freediving by training. So you have

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:08.800
different techniques. You can train in swimming pool and you can say, you know, frankly for me,

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:17.280
I go at the bottom of the swimming pool and I sit there. And then you have relaxation techniques.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.760
Some people meditate. I can't, I am not a good person that can meditate. Or if I do,

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:29.680
I don't know about it. But my way of doing things and taking my mind off the situation I'm in

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:37.760
is by singing in my head. I love music or hearing music. And in fact, knowing the kind of song I'm

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:42.720
singing, I know about the length of time that I'm staying underwater as well. So this is how,

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.920
you know, so this is my own way. People have different ways.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.680
What kind of music are we talking about?

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:53.760
All sorts of music can be classical, can be pop music, you know, just songs. When you really know

01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:01.200
that you are relaxed and something I experienced actually at 20,000 feet,

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:07.840
which was the greatest experience of my life in those terms, is when you forget that you have

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:14.480
water around you. At that point, you cannot tell whether you are the water or water is you. There

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:21.360
is actually no separation anymore. And I felt that when I was training in the swimming pool,

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:29.200
I never could have imagined that I would feel that way once on top of that volcano. And it

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:34.720
happened. And it was absolutely amazing. It was, you know, we were talking about how life

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:41.520
consciousness permits the universe. At that point in time, on that volcano, that day,

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:50.000
it took me by surprise. I was not expecting it. Everything around me, the lake, was arctic blue.

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:57.920
With all the ray of the sun, you could tell them apart, every single one of them. I was surrounded

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:04.560
by golden darts. And it was the most incredible experience. And I don't know if it's that kind

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:14.000
of environment that led me to just go into whatever state of meditation or whatnot. But

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.760
all of a sudden, there was no separation anymore between me, the water, the volcano.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:25.760
And if I came with questions, they didn't matter anymore because for that fraction of a second,

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.120
it seemed that I had all the answers in the universe.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:31.280
Was it the connectedness with everything?

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.400
You can call it that way. I still don't know what it means, you know, literally.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:43.840
But it is that moment where you feel that it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter anymore.

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:52.240
It was an absolute peace, absolute understanding. And it was incredible. It was an absolute

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.760
awareness. Could you describe it as beautiful?

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:04.080
That would go beyond that. I think that there is clearly, in my mind today, no words that can

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:11.120
express how perfect this was. Does that start to speak to why you love diving? Or is there

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:16.320
something special about that place, diving at such elevations and volcanoes?

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.440
You know, I started diving pretty much, this is the first thing I did when I was near water.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:27.600
In fact, there is a very fun little incident with my parents, me being on the shore of a lake

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:35.520
on vacation. I was three years old, maybe. And I had these little lifesavers on my arms,

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:42.080
and my parents were not watching. And in my little brain, I still can remember today saying,

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.680
well, nothing bad can happen to me. I cannot drown if I go underwater.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.680
See, that's the logic of a three-year-old.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:53.600
It kind of works. I mean, that's pretty brilliant.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:59.840
So I removed the lifesavers that I had, and I just went in the water. My mom said before

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:06.400
she could do anything, I was under. And it was like a natural thing. And for me, I felt

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:13.520
immediately at home and as little as I was, completely. And it goes beyond that.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:22.560
This sense of connectedness or oneness or whatever, I always felt good underwater.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:28.720
So it doesn't matter really if it's 20,000 feet. The thing that matters at that point is that you

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:36.240
need to get there. So you need to get with all the gears, with your hiking, trekking equipment,

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.560
high mountaineering gears. And when you get on top of that, you have to remove all that and

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:46.720
don a suit. Is there something you can speak

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:51.440
to the challenging aspects of that process? Or is it just like this rigorous process that's

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.320
well-designed that you have to go through and you don't think?

01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:02.560
We are humans. This is where most of the risk is because you can be well-prepared,

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:08.080
but for one reason or another, you get sick. And you can get sick not only because of

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:14.480
high altitude sickness, it can be a number of things. Or you can be tired or you can catch a

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.480
cold. And then of course you have the mountain itself. We had a magnitude 7.8 earthquake

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.800
hitting one day when we are 50 meters away from the summit.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.800
So you can't obviously plan for that.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:33.680
No, you can't. And that's the axe of gods. Working with NASA, although I am the director

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:38.800
of the study institute, my grants are coming from NASA, so I'm a NASA contractor. And every

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:44.640
time we go to those environments, we have to go through the rigorous process of training with NASA

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.200
and checking all the boxes for safety. So they are training and training and training us,

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:55.440
and I have to thank them because a lot of those trainings are the things that are in your brain

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.600
when these kinds of things happen. You know how to react and you are not freaking out.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:06.000
But in all of the things they are training us for, you have the green risk, the yellow risk,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.440
and the red risk. So the green risks are basically the don't be stupid and don't do the kind of thing

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:17.680
you wouldn't be doing at home like it's jumping on rocks that are not stable. You can tweak your

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:24.320
ankle. And then you have other risks like high altitude sickness, how you prepare for that,

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:29.280
how you recognize that. These are the yellow risks. And then the red risks. The red risks

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.880
are what they call the axe of gods, the kind of thing that they can happen. You know there is

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:40.960
nothing you can do about it, and then you accept that when you do that. So those are volcanic

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:47.760
eruptions when you're in this kind of environment, earthquakes, and avalanches, for instance.

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.880
So you're on this giant mountain and it's shaking.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:57.280
No, it's not shaking. That's the interesting part of it. There was a whole background of things

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:05.360
that happened that day when we started off. But we got to 50 meters from the summit. And I have

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:11.440
part of my logistics team that is at the foot of the mountain. And being so close to the summit,

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:18.480
we have to go under an overhang of lava. So it's just like we are just under this big vault of lava

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.600
and it's actually beautiful. If you want something beautiful,

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.160
it's the Altiplano seen from 20,000 feet. It's just absolutely stunning.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.520
What are the colors? What are we looking at?

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:35.520
The colors are that of early earth, which means primordial earth. It's ochres, yellows, oranges,

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:44.000
browns with a dark blue sky. And so you're just, you know, it's a time machine. You're just out

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:51.200
there and you're climbing 42 degree slopes. So all of a sudden I'm right next behind the guide

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.720
and the guide has been with us. It's family, you know, we've been together for 10 years

01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:05.840
and he's starting to do that. I don't discuss. When Macario do that, you know, I listen and I

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.640
ask the team to do the same thing where maybe half a dozen. And then I went to talk to him and say,

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:16.080
what's going on? He's on the radio. And then he gives me the radio. I'm talking to my logistic

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:20.480
chief officer who was at the bottom. And he said, we're having a tremendous earthquake.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:29.520
He was saying that the, actually the ground was waving. It was so bad. And he was freaking out

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:34.560
because he said, everything is avalanching and I'm very puzzled because we are in a very dangerous

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:39.520
part of the volcano. Nothing's happening. I turned around and then this is when I realized

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:45.600
there is dust absolutely everywhere. Everything that I saw two minutes before it's gone just

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:52.320
disappear into a wall of dust, but nothing's happening where we are. And our friends down,

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:56.960
they were freaking out because they were seeing everything avalanching and especially the other

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.840
side of the mountain we were on was avalanching. So they have no visuals. They have no visual.

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:07.040
They thought that we are caught in the avalanching. So I said, no, but some,

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.040
so at that point- So they thought you were screwed.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:18.800
Yeah. And I said, okay, so if this is what's happening, then I'm taking everybody to the summit

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:23.600
because we have a very large crater that will take care of avalanching, will be safe. And I'm

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:29.840
waiting for the aftershock because this is what you do when you have earthquakes. So here we go,

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:36.960
taking everybody in the crater. And now you have half a dozen scientists in the crater with the

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:45.520
crater lake. And this is why we came for. So we just had a 7.8 earthquake. And what do you think

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:51.680
they do? Well, of course they do the science they came to do. So the only thing is that I couldn't

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:59.920
because my radio was only working when I was on the rim of the crater, but I had a little assistant

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:07.520
with me, a young Bolivian teenager. He had been shadowing me for three weeks. So he knew exactly

01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:12.080
what to do. And he said, Natalie, no problem. Give me your bag. I'll do the sampling for you.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:16.480
So I was monitoring the situation and- Were you scared?

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:25.680
And I wasn't at that point. And there was another moment, my friend downstairs, I could,

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:31.680
at the foot, yeah, we've known each other. As I said, we're a family. This team is family.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:38.640
We've known each other. I am the grandmother's kid. So we are close. And I could feel for the

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:47.360
first time in my life that he actually was scared. And he was calling me every 30 seconds,

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:53.120
telling me stuff. I say, you have to stop this now. Just call me to give me information that

01:32:53.120 --> 01:33:00.880
is useful for me to make decisions. And so I say, okay, what's going on? All right. He tells me,

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:06.160
there is still avalanche, et cetera. And then a few minutes later, he calls me and says,

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.560
I think that Laskar is erupting. So now I have to tell you, we are on a volcano.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:16.480
The next volcano, we share a slope with it. It's a little lower, but that's the most

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:24.000
temperamental volcano of the entire chain. And this one has a history of eruption. And then

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:30.320
my friend is telling me that the volcano seems to be starting to erupt. If that volcano goes off,

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:38.240
we have nowhere to go. That got my attention. So if you say scared, I would say that I got

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:43.840
the realization that what that meant. I went cold for like a fraction of a second, but that meant

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:49.440
that just my adrenaline started to kick in. And it was a very, very strange experience because

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:54.640
now you have tunnel vision. It's about survival. And I say, okay, now you are going to tell me

01:33:54.640 --> 01:34:01.920
what I need to know. Tell me, what do you see? He says, I see smoke. I say, what kind of smoke?

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:08.480
He says, it's white. I say, no big deal. That's water vapor. Okay. Where is it going?

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.560
It's going to Argentina. That was the opposite direction of where we are. I said, okay,

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:18.960
I'm staying where I am because right now there is no danger. And there is still the issue of

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:25.600
the aftershock. I didn't want to have the team caught in the central gully of the volcano

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:31.120
with the Netherlands coming at us. So I stood there. And he called me after that and said,

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:38.960
well, it's still going to Argentina. Fine. Okay. And then a little later, he calls me and says,

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:46.080
Natalie, things are changing here. I say, okay, what's going on? I say, well, the cloud is a

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:54.880
little yellow. And I was thinking myself. What does it mean when it's yellow?

01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:03.680
Sulfur. And then when you have sulfur mixed with the water vapor or the water in your lungs,

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.800
this turns into sulfuric acid. Then you're really screwed. And I say, okay.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.600
Thank you for the information.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.800
Where is the cloud going? He said, the wing is shifting. It's coming your direction.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:24.080
Yeah, that was a day like that. And I am talking to him on the radio and I'm turning around.

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:29.040
And as I turned around, I see the cloud starting to pop on the opposite side of the rim.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:36.400
So at that time, we had no choice anymore because now you have to figure out what's going to kill

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:44.080
you first. And so there was the risk or the potential of an avalanche, but at least you can

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:51.120
see the rocks. The gas is going to kill you before you can see it. So I called everybody back.

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:58.960
We gather our stuff. I didn't give too much detail, but I say it's time to go downhill and fast,

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:06.160
so which we did. We stopped only when we were at mid-camp. And then at that point,

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:11.520
we saw the cloud just completely covering the summit where we were. So we did well to bail out,

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:18.640
but that was 500 meters higher than we were. So we are safe. I was just making sure that

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:24.800
it would not go down the slope where we were. We are safe. So we stayed and just rested for a

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:30.400
little while. And after that, we descended. And it was all an adrenaline. I can tell you what,

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:35.120
I had two of my crew with headaches. Part of one of them was because of the altitude,

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:40.240
we climbed very fast. The other one was because of the cloud. She was the closest to the cloud when

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.480
it happened. So we descended fast. Wow, that was close.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:50.480
That was close. And it's interesting how the human body and mind works, because I know that

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:56.240
from the moment my friend told me that the volcano seemed to be erupting, I was going on

01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:03.200
adrenaline. But when we got close to them and I saw him, we were getting close to the cars,

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:08.640
I saw him coming towards me. And the slope, all of a sudden, all the adrenaline went away.

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:15.360
I was a mess. I had to find the first rock and sit down. It was gone.

01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:20.720
Fascinating. So you just basically physically and mentally collapsed once you saw.

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:27.360
Absolutely. There was nothing left of me. I got in the car and I felt in the car as we were heading

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:32.640
back towards our camp, I could have passed out. I really fought back. And I'm not the kind of

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:41.280
passing out really easy, but there was nothing left. I had no energy, no nothing. It's fabulous

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:49.440
how you react and how this is embedded in your brain from eons of evolution,

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:56.720
of reaction to a dangerous situation, basically. The drive to survive.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:00.640
Yeah, something like that. You just told us one heck of a story.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:07.360
And as you said, such story comes along with many of the diving expeditions that you do. But

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:14.480
on the science side, what is that world that simulates, that travels back in time

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:18.080
into the Martian landscape? What does the science reveal?

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:26.560
The science reveals that life is resilient. When I started that project, I told my husband,

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:31.120
I said, this is going to be very fast. We are going in such nasty environment that we're not

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:38.240
going to find anything. And we'll be back home fairly soon. So 20 years later, we are still

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:42.880
studying those environments. Those you've got feeling like not much can possibly survive.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:50.000
Well, the UV environment is so nasty. But there you find the same microorganism

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:57.840
that made the very first fossils on earth 3.5 billion years ago. And they keep surviving.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:05.520
They developed an adaptation, Swiss army knife, if you prefer. And so you learn about that.

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:12.320
You learn about what they are, how they adapt through times and through environmental changes,

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:17.600
which is really important. What are their signatures? We learn to recognize them.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:23.920
We learn what kind of instrument we need, what kind of signature, whether it's chemical or

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:31.760
morphological or whatnot. So basically, we learn how to explore. But I would say that to me,

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:36.640
and this is a realization, interestingly enough, that came three years into the project,

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:46.160
I really woke up literally one morning saying, you know, we have been coming here for three years now

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:52.800
trying to understand how to search for life on Mars. But what this place is showing us is what's

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:59.200
happening right here right now on our own planet. And by exploring those extreme environments,

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:04.960
we are also reaching to places not too many people go. And so we are learning more about our own

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:12.640
biospheres and the diversity of our own life here on earth. So these are the two main things

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.600
that I would say. What kind of life survives up there?

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:22.560
On top of those volcanoes, it's about bacteria, you know, mostly.

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:27.440
Is there something specific about that bacteria that's able to be so rugged?

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:33.760
Yes. They have adapted to very high UV radiation. And it's not only because they are at high

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:42.480
altitude. It's because early Earth didn't have an ozone layer. So when the ancestors of those

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:50.240
bacteria originated, they have to survive a world where you had lots of short UV coming down at the

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:57.200
surface and also lots of hydrothermal environment, you know, volcanoes and hot water, lots of salt.

01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:05.440
And you see all these toolbox still embedded in those microorganisms today, four billion years

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:12.400
later. It's just amazing. And depending on the environment, they are going to switch some of these

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:24.720
defenses adaptation on or off. The UV situation there is so nasty that here you have bacteria like

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.360
that. I know bacteria, you find them everywhere. It's really something you find all over the place.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:37.040
But if you find them here in California, they will turn their protection against UV during the day in

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:44.720
summer and they will switch it off at the end of the day. There in the Andes, it's so nasty that

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:52.000
that thing stays on all the time. But if you take samples and bring them back here and start to

01:41:53.040 --> 01:42:00.880
culture them, like we did on top of a building, leaving them, you will see the second generation

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:08.960
of this organism, they are starting to switch on and off again. So they are extremely adaptable,

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:16.400
extremely rugged. And that's why they are still here. And probably that's why we're here because

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.680
life finds ways. Is there some degree to which the harshness of the conditions

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:28.000
enables the flourishing of life versus shuts it down?

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:34.800
Well, it will shut down those that cannot survive. Obviously, this is a statement that's

01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:40.960
kept an obvious right there, but it's also the survival of the fittest. And this is what

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:51.520
evolution is. So they are here because they were the most adaptable. And so evolution is

01:42:51.520 --> 01:43:00.000
going to show the path of the fittest. The one that cannot resist, they might have a good time

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:08.240
for a little while, but then... We've seen this at much different scale. And with complex life,

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:17.200
not so long ago, 100,000 years ago, Neanderthal was side by side by Homo sapiens. But Neanderthal

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:23.520
was completely adapted to a cold earth, to a glacial earth of the end of the Pleistocene.

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.840
And when conditions change, it couldn't last. You think... I mean, there's still some mysteries

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:36.400
around that, right? Exactly what were the harshness of the conditions. I'm still

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.600
really suspicious. What did Homo sapiens do? No, no, no, no.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:43.280
I really want to know. There's some shady stuff that happened.

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:48.160
Shady stuff happened. They met. They bred together. They fought against each other.

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:55.520
What humans do, you had to expect that. But the thing is that Neanderthal was completely adapted

01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:04.000
for a very long time to live at the edge of those glaciers. They were probably in a weakened

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:13.360
situation when Homo sapiens came and started to spread. So basically, this is what life does.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.360
It adapts. And if you cannot adapt anymore, it disappears and something else takes over.

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:25.120
You hold the Women's World Record for diving at altitudes, both scuba and free diving. So I have

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:31.920
to ask, can you describe the details of those records? I never looked. For those, I'm not

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.480
after records at all. In fact, I didn't know I had broken those records when that happened.

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.680
We did that as part of our expedition, our scientific expedition.

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:44.880
So it's basically sport in the name of science versus...

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:50.560
No, it's science in the name of science. And it's just a very physical thing that you have to do.

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.960
So we trained ourselves like athletes. To get the job done.

01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.840
To get the job done. You're holding your breath underwater

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:04.000
for a very long time with free diving. What are we talking about? Do you think in terms of time,

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.680
is there layers where you know through training you're in a good place? I'm sure you take time

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.880
off and you get rusty, right? Yes. And I have not been diving in a while,

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:20.800
so probably I need to go back to the drawing board at the bottom of the swimming pool. But

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:24.880
having training from the past, I think it will pick up much more faster than...

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:30.720
Basically, I would never, at those altitudes, I would never go over three minutes. That would

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:35.920
be suicidal. So the altitude is much tougher than the pool back at ground level.

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:40.800
It is, but it's not... Oh, it's because when you come up and you have to get up.

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:44.880
Yes. That's not the going in the water. When I'm underwater, I'm fine. And if I wanted,

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.440
I could stay longer, but it wouldn't be very wise.

01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:52.400
You've written about the history of life on Mars. Like you said, you're kind of exploring that by

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:59.680
looking at the lakes here. Do you think there's been life on Mars? Do you think there is life on

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:05.360
Mars? Right. So when you're looking at the environment of Mars early on, it's fairly

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:11.680
similar to that of early Earth. Never was exactly the same because Mars was always farther from the

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:19.040
Sun than the Earth. So it was always a little cooler, but you have to imagine maybe the Arctic

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:25.440
during the summer, that would be early Mars, with a lot going on for it in terms of environment,

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:32.800
very favorable to even life as we know it. So we don't know how fast life

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:42.560
So we don't know how fast life happened on Earth. There are signs right now showing that it might

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.960
have actually originated only 200 million years after the crust cooled down.

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.880
Yeah. This still has to be verified, but that's the closest. And these are indirect evidence,

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:59.600
like carbon left by the activity of life, not life itself. And there is a twist in the story

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:07.440
for Mars is that it seems that Mars came together as a planet faster than the Earth

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:17.040
and had water earlier than the Earth. So it may be that Mars was habitable and might have seen

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:25.600
the beginning of life earlier than the Earth. So all of this is speculation, obviously. We haven't

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:32.880
found any evidence or solid evidence yet. I would say unambiguous evidence, but unambiguous

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:39.360
evidence of life is going to be something interesting to prove because we don't know

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:44.240
what life is, remember. So I always joke that the only way we would know that there is life on Mars

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:51.200
if there was a rabbit jumping in front of the rover. But we might be gathering, we have what

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:58.960
we call a ladder of life detection, which is that you have a series of ranks that you need to go

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:09.680
through that actually are not proving you that you discovered life, but are making the possibility

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:16.160
that what you discovered was made only by the environment more and more improbable.

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:21.280
So we are trying to prove the contrary, right? So this is what we have right now.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:28.480
And as far as I'm concerned, considering all the unknowns we have, I think there was as much chance

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:36.160
that life originated on Mars that it did on Earth. And if it was at the surface,

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:42.320
then it got in trouble after 500 million years because of the disappearance of the

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:47.680
magnetosphere, the loss of the magnetosphere and the atmosphere. But as we know, life doesn't

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:55.520
only stay in one place. As soon as it's out there, it's going to adapt, it's going to give itself

01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:05.360
more chance to survive. And that to me means that if life appeared, I would say it's still there

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:10.720
and probably on the ground where it can be in an environment that's more stable. So I don't know

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.000
how stability is good or not. It might not be so good, but they might be in a different type

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:22.080
of metabolism through dormancy, waiting for different climate cycles. And there is the

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:30.400
fact that Mars changes a lot faster than the Earth. And climate changes are a lot stronger

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:35.840
in magnitude. So there might be a place on Mars. We know that there is a place on Mars

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:41.840
deeper in the subsurface where temperature and pressure are good for liquid water to stay there.

01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.920
So these would be good places for a stable habitat over time, no matter what happens

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:56.320
at the surface. But if life is also caught between that deep zone and the surface,

01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:02.080
there is an active layer. There is a lot of ice in the subsurface of Mars. And when the climate

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:09.600
changes, when the obliquity goes beyond 30 degrees, then at that point you will have some

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:18.240
activation of that zone. You have thawing of the ice. So all this region is reactivated. And maybe

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:26.480
that's a way where you have pathways for life to move from the deep zone to closer to the surface.

01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:33.680
This is why I'm one of those scientists who think that life might not be so far from the surface

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:41.280
than we think. So we don't have to dig very far to find it. We probably won't. That would be so

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:47.120
amazing. I'm thinking of that just because of this experience as well of extreme environments.

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:54.080
You have to sit and look and listen, basically, to the story of my life. If I want to understand

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:58.960
where microbes are located on Mars, I have to become the microbe, right? This is the

01:50:58.960 --> 01:51:04.560
thought experiment. And if I want to understand where ET is, then I have to become ET. So it's a

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:13.040
big stretch. But in extreme environment, you sit in the desert for a while and you just try to

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.240
understand where the wind is coming from, where the humidity, when it's showing up. And then you

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:23.040
start to understand the patterns of those things. What are the useful signals that you need for

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:29.440
survival? You need to know where water is, where the source of energy is going to be drawn from.

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:34.080
You need to find shelters. And shelters don't mean that, for instance, you can have a water

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:42.400
column of a lake or a river or whatnot, or the ocean. It can be also a very thin layer of dust,

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:50.640
or it can be a translucent rock. And you see what we call endless. These are the same cyanobacteria,

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:55.600
but a different version of them. They live inside the rocks, inside those crystals,

01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:03.920
because they have the best of life. They are into translucent crystals so that they receive the light

01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:11.840
from the sun. They can do the photosynthesis. But there is enough of that crystal so that the nasty

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:22.320
UV is being stopped. And they are in their little house. And when you are looking at the temperature

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:28.080
within those rocks, they tend to make it toaster than the outside temperature. So there is a lot

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:35.600
of things going on. So what I'm saying for Mars is that, yeah, right now you don't have an atmosphere

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:42.000
very much, 160 times thinner than the Earth. Six millibars is really not much, but it's there.

01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:50.400
But you still have a lot of UV, the short UV, like the nasty one, UVA, UVB, UVC that can really mess

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:59.360
up your DNA and destroy it beyond repair. But as soon as you have a little alcove into a rock

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:06.960
or a cliff, I'd be looking at those places, but you have to understand Mars, or any other planet

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:14.240
for that matter, at the level that matters for the microbe. And so then-

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.000
Be one with the microbe.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.120
Be one with the microbe, which means that we have lots of orbital data,

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:25.360
which is good to understand habitability at the planet level or at the regional level.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:25.860
Yeah.

01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:32.240
But we have very little data right now that is very useful to understand habitability

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:39.600
at the scale that matters for the microbes at this point in time. So we need to do a better job with

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:47.600
that. My idea is to have arrays of environmental stations that could have a lot of benefits.

01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:52.720
One would be to give us that vision for the microbes. That would be good for us through

01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:54.880
biology. And second-

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.200
A collection of stations on Mars.

01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.160
On Mars, yeah.

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:01.120
That give us a good map of the planet.

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:06.000
High resolution, we can do that regionally. And on top of that, so that's good for us through

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:12.320
biology for the search for life on Mars. That's good about how to learn where microbes could be

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:18.800
that can be a problem for contamination both ways. So that's good for planetary protection.

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:26.320
And since those stations would have communication capabilities on them, that's excellent for human

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:31.360
exploration because now normally you have weather stations all over the place that can tell your

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:37.840
astronauts. Learn the pattern when it's a good time to go out or not go out and also helps them

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:43.920
communicate when they go and do sorties. So there are a number of things you can do that can tell

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.760
you lots of information.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:52.480
Let's rewind the clock a little bit. You grew up in Paris. I was just there. Helen McDonald in

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:57.840
her New York Times, amazing profile piece of you, writes that your teenage years were troubled.

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:05.200
So how did the challenging early years make the human being the scientist that you are today?

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:12.800
Everything. I think that this is what's taking me on top of those big mountains.

01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:20.640
And the irony is for me to be looking for the origin and nature of life because I was so close

01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:30.080
to losing it. But to me that was a great lesson learned and that helped me see through the beauty

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:38.640
of life. Going on the other side of that, it became really what made me and helped me go through

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:46.000
absolutely everything and anything in life. Climb mountains and tell me there is something

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:55.280
I want to know and I am going to give it my best and I won't give up and I won't give in.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:03.200
This is a message that I carried all my life and I'm so very grateful that I did because

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:06.480
all these things that I would have missed if I hadn't done that.

01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:12.160
This is something that I wrote in my first book and part of it is the reason why I wrote it,

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:20.720
just because I felt that there were messages in my path. Oftentimes teenagers are troubled.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:25.760
It can be one way or another. Or if it's not a troubled teenage, you have times in your life

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:31.840
where you doubt, where you're just waving your arm and say, what's the purpose? What's the reason?

01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:36.080
By carrying on. When I see all the things that I'm doing,

01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:41.840
the dream that I was able to fulfill, what a waste it would have been.

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:48.400
There was a point in your life where you thought about suicide.

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:55.040
Oh, yeah. I did more than thinking about it, but I was the lucky one. For some reason,

01:56:55.040 --> 01:57:01.040
I'm still here. I still don't know why, but I'm still here. The lesson for me was that never,

01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:08.480
ever again, because you have to give tomorrow a chance. You never can think about tomorrow

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:14.000
in the terms of the present. You never know what can happen. You know what is going to happen if

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:23.600
you go through what you want to do. Tomorrow is never happening. The other lesson came a few

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:29.760
years later where actually somebody was drowning and I went after that person. I almost died that

01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:34.720
day too. Not that I wanted to, but it's just because the conditions were very, very difficult.

01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:43.520
That person died from there, although we took him out of the water. I had a lot of difficulty

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:50.800
coming out. I came out, but then I thought a lot about that guy. He was in his 30s. It was like

01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:58.560
a sort of an echo from a few years before telling me that person would never have a tomorrow. That

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:05.040
person would never be able to fulfill his dream or even have dreams of any kind. I was here and

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:10.480
I was going to give myself the best chance to fulfill all the dreams I wanted to and go after

01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:18.320
all the questions I wanted to. This is what gets me going now. The advice there is even if you don't

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:27.440
see an answer to the why question, why live today, give tomorrow a chance always.

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:33.920
Do you think about your death today? Do you think about your mortality?

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:37.680
Not really.

01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:40.160
You've been so close with it so many times.

01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:46.160
Yeah. That's part of life. You know what? If something happens to me while I'm doing the

01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:54.720
stuff I love, what a way of going. This will happen wherever it catches me. I don't know.

01:58:54.720 --> 01:59:00.320
I don't care. It will be what it will be. I had the best of all masters for that.

01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:09.600
I had my husband. My husband and I were 44 years apart in age. It was just a pure love story.

01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:19.280
He never looked at his age, never thought about himself or defined himself by his age. In fact,

01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:25.040
he reinvented life for himself at an age where everybody retires. We met when he was 66.

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:32.000
That was a blessing and a curse, but a blessing most of it because we took every single day as

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:42.000
if it was the last. We enjoyed life. Right now, it's not so much. I have to really think of him.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:52.800
It just passed away this last August. For me, it's more like I have to draw from his example

01:59:53.600 --> 02:00:06.880
on him always telling me, look forward, trust life, be happy, live. Today, every single day,

02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:13.920
I have to remind several times a day of this. It's not easy, but he had the recipe. He never

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:18.720
thought about death because when you start thinking too much about death, that prevents you from

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:29.120
living. Do you miss him? Oh, gosh. We were so close. I think it's more like one spirit in two

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:39.760
bodies. We were that close. Missing him doesn't even cut it. It's the toughest mountain I ever

02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:48.160
climbed. What's the role of love in the human condition? I think, I hope, that this is the

02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:52.960
force that drives the universe, although we might be experiencing the other side of it,

02:00:53.520 --> 02:01:04.240
maybe just to learn how important love is. That might be it. For me, my experience with my husband

02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:12.320
where I never had to wake up every single morning ever wondering if I was loved, I had to look

02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:21.200
in his eyes and him looking back at me to know it. When you get to that point

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:25.840
where you don't question it anymore, I would hope for humanity to reach that point

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:31.680
where you can feel the same love for the person that is unknown in the street,

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:38.080
that you feel for the people you love. I think that at that point, we are going to be reaching

02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:44.000
the maturity of that civilization we are hoping for and seeing the universe through love.

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:53.520
Yeah, that doesn't run spacecrafts, of course, but putting love into our intent of going into

02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:58.960
and settling into another planet instead of, oh my God, we need to escape because we are

02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:06.480
freaking, messing up with our own planet. I think that this is the answer to so many things.

02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:15.600
Is there a part of you that maybe just a little bit wants to step foot on Mars, like you personally?

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:21.680
Oh yeah, of course. I'm curious. I'm a scientist and I've been working on Mars. I was actually

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:26.880
privileged to be working on Gusev Crater and deciding for the landing site of the Spirit

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:32.000
Rover, which means that I worked on that landing site for 15 years and I got to see it from the

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.840
ground. That's the closest to being there and exploring. Of course, that's not physically be

02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:43.920
present there. If you were giving me the opportunity, of course, I would go, but I know

02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:54.080
one thing, I would want to come back. So given the option of dying on Mars or dying on Earth,

02:02:54.960 --> 02:02:59.120
you'd visit Mars, but you would like to spend your last days on Mars?

02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:02.240
But you would like to spend your last days here.

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:08.960
Yeah, because of a number of things. I think that, first, we are not ready to sit on Mars,

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:15.360
regardless of what being said. It will happen. It will happen and because we are explorers,

02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:22.080
humans, they're explorers, so this will happen. It's a good thing. Depending on how we go about

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:28.160
this, it can be a very good thing. With time, as much as I've been exploring, continue to explore

02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:34.960
the big questions of origin and nature of life or exploring of a planet, the love,

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:42.560
you were talking about love, the love for my own planet has grown deeper and my concern about it

02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:49.600
has grown deeper. So the data that I'm collecting to learn about other planets, I'm also using it

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:55.520
to understand better our home planet and trying to make it a little better for the next generation.

02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:02.080
So if you were talking about love, this is love that would drive me back here.

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:10.960
Yeah, this planet, sometimes I just pause and am in awe at the incredible thing we have here

02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:19.360
and I have deep gratitude for all the life forms here, the beautiful complexity. Of course,

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:23.920
there's darkness behind it, all the death, all the extinction that led

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:30.640
up to us two descendants of apes sitting here today. I feel that's a responsibility.

02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:38.480
We're the fittest that survived. Exactly right. As the dominant species,

02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:45.280
at least technologically, et cetera, maybe not the wisest one, but the dominant species,

02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:51.200
we have a responsibility towards the entire biosphere because the decisions we are making

02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:59.280
now not only affect us, they're affecting the entire biosphere. Right now, the choices we are

02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:07.200
making are leading to the disappearance of 150 species every single day. All the big mammals

02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:11.760
on this earth today are on the brink of extinction.

02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:20.400
We are within the sixth greatest mass extinction. It's unfolding before our eyes.

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:34.000
I would strongly suggest that we use our smart to help a little bit this situation. We can do this.

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:39.760
I think we can do this. We just need to redirect our energy.

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:46.560
In the name of love. This was an incredible conversation. I'm really honored that you sit

02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:51.680
with me. I've been a fan of your work for a long time now, so this is really awesome.

02:05:51.680 --> 02:05:54.240
Thank you so much for talking to me. You're very welcome. Thanks.

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:59.440
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Natalie Cabral. To support this podcast,

02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:04.240
please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, let me leave you with some words from

02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:09.040
Stanislav Lem and Solaris. How do you expect to communicate with the ocean

02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:15.840
when we can't even understand one another? Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
