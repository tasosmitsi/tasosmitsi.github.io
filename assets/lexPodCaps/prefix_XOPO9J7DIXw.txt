WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
We have two tubes that are right next to each other

00:02.440 --> 00:03.280
in the throat.

00:03.280 --> 00:06.600
One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,

00:06.600 --> 00:08.320
whatever you're gonna swallow.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.480
All of that stuff must go down the esophagus,

00:10.480 --> 00:12.640
the food tube, and end up in the stomach.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.640
And right next to the esophagus, millimeters away,

00:15.640 --> 00:17.540
is the windpipe or the trachea,

00:17.540 --> 00:19.040
which goes down to the lungs.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.640
Throat, heart, feces, genitals.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.920
Every organ from moment to moment keeps us alive

00:24.920 --> 00:26.020
and ensures our survival.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.920
The genitals are, in a way, the opposite.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.500
How would you improve the penis and the vagina?

00:33.960 --> 00:36.680
The following is a conversation with Jonathan Reisman,

00:36.680 --> 00:40.080
a physician and writer of The Unseen Body,

00:40.080 --> 00:42.640
a doctor's journey through the hidden wonders

00:42.640 --> 00:44.200
of human anatomy.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.920
He has practiced medicine

00:45.920 --> 00:48.000
in some of the world's most remote places,

00:48.000 --> 00:52.880
including the Alaskan and Russian Arctic, Antarctica,

00:52.880 --> 00:56.600
and the Himalayan mountains of Nepal.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.760
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.360
in the description.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.900
And now, dear friends, here's Jonathan Reisman.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.560
You wrote a book called Unseen Body,

01:09.560 --> 01:12.200
all about the human body, the messy, the weird,

01:12.200 --> 01:14.860
the beautiful, and the fascinating details.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.320
So, from an evolutionary perspective,

01:18.320 --> 01:21.920
are most parts of the human body a feature or a bug?

01:21.920 --> 01:24.240
Is it like the optimal solution

01:24.240 --> 01:26.320
or just a duct tape solution?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.160
Great question.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.440
I think that most of the time,

01:29.440 --> 01:32.400
the way the body works is the best solution.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.640
I haven't seen many alternatives, so it's hard to compare.

01:35.640 --> 01:38.200
But I think, you know, there's some parts of the body

01:38.200 --> 01:40.120
that make more sense than others.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.520
You know, the way our hands work, for instance.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.280
You know, the muscles are up in the forearm

01:45.280 --> 01:47.020
and then the tendons kind of come down

01:47.020 --> 01:48.880
like strings on a puppet.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.720
And just the dexterity it gives our hands

01:50.720 --> 01:52.600
is just really amazing.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.320
And it's hard to imagine a better tool

01:55.400 --> 01:57.400
than the human hand to do everything from, you know,

01:57.400 --> 01:59.760
hold things to play piano

01:59.760 --> 02:02.560
and do a million other daily activities that we do.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.080
One thing I talk about in the book,

02:05.080 --> 02:07.800
there's some other body parts that seem to be lacking

02:07.800 --> 02:11.560
that kind of brilliant design, such as the throat,

02:11.560 --> 02:15.240
you know, where the food, drink are swallowed

02:15.240 --> 02:16.320
and air is inhaled.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.800
And they kind of, those two paths

02:17.800 --> 02:19.880
come within millimeters of each other.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.560
And you slip up once, you laugh while eating,

02:22.560 --> 02:24.760
or you speak while trying to swallow

02:24.760 --> 02:26.400
and you die from choking.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.320
So it seems less than optimal,

02:28.320 --> 02:30.040
though I'm not sure it could be better

02:30.040 --> 02:33.040
from the way we're kind of formed in the womb

02:33.040 --> 02:35.880
as a beginning as this tiny little tube.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.700
I don't think it could have been done any better

02:37.700 --> 02:39.100
or there's any other way to do it,

02:39.100 --> 02:41.480
but it is an unfortunate thing that, you know,

02:41.480 --> 02:43.000
does lead to some problems.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.440
So the hand, if I could just linger on that for a second,

02:46.440 --> 02:50.400
you talk about the wisdom of a design in the book.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.360
What are the important things about the hand?

02:53.160 --> 02:55.240
It seems like very useful for many things

02:55.240 --> 02:57.400
and it seems to be quite effective.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.040
A lot of people think the thumb is foundational

03:01.040 --> 03:05.560
to the human civilization.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.200
Is there any truth to that?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.080
I think that is true.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.260
Actually, one of the ways in which the importance

03:10.260 --> 03:13.300
of individual fingers comes to attention

03:13.300 --> 03:15.760
is when people have severe injuries to their fingers.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.440
For instance, I have a story in the book

03:18.440 --> 03:21.240
about a guy whose thumb is nearly ripped off

03:21.240 --> 03:23.160
by his dog's leash.

03:23.160 --> 03:26.200
And, you know, when plastic surgeons,

03:26.200 --> 03:27.760
who are often the ones to repair that,

03:27.760 --> 03:29.680
sometimes it's orthopedic surgeons,

03:29.680 --> 03:31.360
they will debate, you know,

03:31.360 --> 03:33.940
how important is it to save this finger?

03:33.940 --> 03:36.080
Or how important is it to save, you know,

03:36.080 --> 03:39.520
let's say the kind of tip, the one third,

03:39.520 --> 03:41.400
the tip one third of one of your fingers.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.180
You know, it depends on the length that you'll lose.

03:43.180 --> 03:44.760
It depends on which finger.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.000
And so the thumb really is the most crucial

03:48.000 --> 03:50.680
just, you know, for your occupation in most cases

03:51.440 --> 03:54.120
to just daily life and your ability to get around

03:54.120 --> 03:55.240
and take care of yourself and others.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.560
So, you know, they'll be more,

03:57.560 --> 04:00.000
they're willing to go further, do more surgeries,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.360
more aggressive therapy to save a thumb, let's say,

04:03.360 --> 04:05.440
than, you know, the tip of your pinky finger.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.640
So in that way, I do think the thumb, you know,

04:07.640 --> 04:09.840
does seem like the most important in many ways.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.320
It's nice that there's backups.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.120
I wonder if that's part of the feature.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.960
Or is it just the symmetry that nature produces?

04:15.960 --> 04:18.760
You think the two hands is like,

04:18.800 --> 04:21.520
is it about the symmetry or is it about backup?

04:21.520 --> 04:25.640
We'd be much less formidable hunters, gatherers,

04:25.640 --> 04:29.360
survivors in any way, if we only had one hand.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.960
So I think that is important to have two so we can,

04:32.960 --> 04:35.840
you know, even everything from kind of spearing an animal

04:35.840 --> 04:37.860
to firing a bow and arrow to butchering an animal,

04:37.860 --> 04:40.360
you really need two hands to do it very effectively.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.200
What can you do a better job with three?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.840
Great question.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.360
And we'll never know, perhaps.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.560
You tweeted, now I'm gonna analyze your tweets,

04:51.560 --> 04:53.200
like it's Shakespeare sometimes.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.720
You tweeted that, quote, millions of years of sex and death

04:57.720 --> 04:59.300
designed the human body.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.680
It's like poetry.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.920
Are those two basic activities basically summarize

05:05.920 --> 05:09.180
everything that resulted in humans on Earth?

05:09.180 --> 05:13.880
So like, is that a good summary of the evolutionary process

05:13.880 --> 05:16.560
that led to this conscious, intelligent being,

05:16.560 --> 05:18.500
is death and sex?

05:19.320 --> 05:20.400
In a way, yeah.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.600
So sex is how more of us get made, obviously.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.800
And death is how we get weeded out

05:25.800 --> 05:28.040
or the gene pool gets weeded out

05:28.040 --> 05:30.240
and certain genes survive and others don't.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.600
And, you know, the age at which we die,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.720
whether it's before we've, you know,

05:35.720 --> 05:38.720
had sex and reproduced ourselves is a big factor

05:38.720 --> 05:41.260
and who survives, who doesn't, who passes on their genes

05:41.260 --> 05:44.520
and what the future of the body looks like, you know.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.640
Who lived and who died before they were able

05:47.640 --> 05:50.080
to be at reproductive age a million years ago

05:50.080 --> 05:52.720
was pretty important in what we look like now.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.880
And perhaps how we have sex and die now

05:55.880 --> 05:58.240
will determine what we're shaped like,

05:58.240 --> 06:00.320
unless technology has an even bigger role in that,

06:00.320 --> 06:01.640
you know, a million years from now.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.260
So you think that's fundamental to like,

06:03.260 --> 06:05.280
if there's alien civilizations out there

06:05.280 --> 06:08.440
that have the same order of magnitude of intelligence

06:08.440 --> 06:11.500
or greater, do you think that we will see something

06:11.500 --> 06:13.840
like sex and something like death?

06:13.840 --> 06:18.760
So the reproducing and this selection process

06:18.760 --> 06:23.320
plus the weeding out of the old to make room for the new,

06:23.320 --> 06:25.560
is that kind of foundational to life?

06:25.560 --> 06:26.400
I would think so.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.160
I mean, it sure seems to be on earth, you know,

06:28.160 --> 06:32.440
perhaps in some distant future when medicine is nearing,

06:32.440 --> 06:35.560
you know, perfection and people can live a really long time,

06:36.520 --> 06:39.880
maybe we won't even need to reproduce as much

06:39.880 --> 06:41.120
or something like that, you know,

06:41.120 --> 06:43.840
it's hard to even know what life will be like

06:43.840 --> 06:45.800
in the distant future, but I would guess

06:45.800 --> 06:48.200
that any alien civilization will have the same dependence

06:48.200 --> 06:50.160
on who has sex and who dies.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.840
Well, that's the problem with immortality,

06:51.840 --> 06:56.000
how we're going to clear out the old

06:56.000 --> 06:58.880
to make room for the new, which is a kind of a,

07:00.440 --> 07:03.440
it's like a framework of adaptability

07:03.440 --> 07:04.600
to changing environments.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.640
So as long as the environment is changing

07:06.640 --> 07:09.160
and it seems to always be,

07:09.160 --> 07:11.360
because this is the entirety of the earth system

07:11.360 --> 07:14.160
is a complex system, it seems like you have to adapt

07:14.160 --> 07:19.160
and to adapt, you have to kill off the stubborn old ideas.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.000
And unless there's a way to like not become stubborn and old,

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
but it feels like the nature of wisdom is stubborn and old.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.520
Like that's what wisdom is, it's like the lessons of life,

07:34.520 --> 07:37.320
the lessons of experience solidified

07:37.360 --> 07:39.440
and the solidification is the thing

07:39.440 --> 07:43.400
that actually prevents you from reinventing yourself

07:43.400 --> 07:47.360
to adapt to the new changing conditions.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.000
But then again, why not have both of those modes?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.680
Like I have two minds in one person,

07:51.680 --> 07:55.120
one immortal person that like in the morning,

07:55.120 --> 07:57.240
they act like a teenager, in the evening,

07:57.240 --> 08:00.960
they act like a old wise man, that's possible.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.960
So you can imagine within one mind, both modes,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.280
but those are required.

08:08.280 --> 08:13.280
You have to have the ability to completely reinvent yourself,

08:13.600 --> 08:16.880
which is what death does in an ugly way

08:18.400 --> 08:20.520
or a beautiful way, depending on your perspective,

08:20.520 --> 08:22.280
depending whether you take the human perspective

08:22.280 --> 08:24.800
or the nature's perspective.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.840
And then you have to have the selection,

08:26.840 --> 08:30.320
so competition, so sexual selection.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.200
It's an interesting little planet we got.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.080
What's the weirdest part, function, concept, idea

08:37.080 --> 08:38.600
about the human body to you?

08:38.600 --> 08:40.680
We'll talk about fascinating details,

08:40.680 --> 08:44.520
but what's you, I should say for people

08:44.520 --> 08:48.440
that should read your book, they will come face to face

08:48.440 --> 08:50.600
with the fact that you do not shy away

08:50.600 --> 08:53.480
from the weird and the wonderful of the human body.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.560
It's like, it's fun, but it's honest.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.480
So given that, sorry to make you pick

09:02.480 --> 09:05.240
one of your children, but what's the weirdest one,

09:05.240 --> 09:06.600
would you say?

09:06.600 --> 09:09.120
The weirdest body part.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.480
Or concept or function.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.400
So the chapters you divide up kind of into parts,

09:16.400 --> 09:19.480
but there could be a thread that connects all of them,

09:19.480 --> 09:24.000
the weirdness, or maybe the texture of the substance,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
could be the liquids, the solids, I don't know.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.200
Definitely every body part and bodily fluid

09:29.200 --> 09:33.000
has their own kind of both gross and fascinating aspects.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.080
That's probably why I'm a generalist as a doctor

09:36.080 --> 09:38.720
and couldn't just, as you said, pick one of my children,

09:38.720 --> 09:41.000
become a specialist because I like them all.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.000
I feel like one of the strangest concepts

09:45.000 --> 09:49.080
about the human body is that kind of the aspects of it

09:49.080 --> 09:51.640
that are the most universal that we all do

09:51.640 --> 09:54.400
are the most taboo socially.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.640
I wouldn't have expected that

09:55.640 --> 09:57.680
if I had just looked from the outside,

09:58.320 --> 10:00.960
what we do in the bathroom, what we do in the bedroom,

10:00.960 --> 10:03.760
what we do to our own genitals,

10:03.760 --> 10:06.920
what we do to our, quote unquote, private parts,

10:06.920 --> 10:09.240
they're private, even though it's sort of the thing

10:09.240 --> 10:12.920
that we all have in common is the most we try to hide

10:12.920 --> 10:15.520
from other people and don't talk about in polite company.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.840
I mean, it makes sense as a human living in this society,

10:17.840 --> 10:20.120
but from the outside, it sort of might be surprising.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.120
How do you make sense of that

10:21.120 --> 10:23.880
if you put on your Sigmund Freud hat?

10:24.880 --> 10:26.120
The thing we all do,

10:26.120 --> 10:28.960
why do we make that a taboo thing?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.920
Is it because we like taboos?

10:30.920 --> 10:35.760
Maybe we get off, or maybe our kinks as humans

10:35.760 --> 10:39.000
is to have taboos, and it's kind of efficient

10:39.000 --> 10:41.960
to have taboos about the things that everybody does.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.680
Like you can make walking taboo or something, I don't know.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.360
But just maybe that's what we love.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.440
That's what's exciting to us is the forbidden.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.760
I think, yes, society loves rules for sure.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.120
It loves some societies more than others.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.240
They love controlling how you think

11:00.240 --> 11:02.920
and what you do in public versus in private.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.160
There's a lot of societies where, for instance,

11:05.160 --> 11:07.120
parents have sex in front of children.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.840
For instance, in a traditional Inupiaq Eskimo societies,

11:12.840 --> 11:14.640
that was sort of normal.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.560
I mean, but what are you gonna do,

11:15.560 --> 11:17.800
go outside in the middle of the winter in the Arctic

11:17.800 --> 11:18.720
and do it out there?

11:18.720 --> 11:19.560
Of course not.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.760
There's different taboos in different societies.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.280
Some taboos make perfect sense.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.920
Some taboos are even public health measures,

11:28.920 --> 11:32.080
like as I talk in the book about in India,

11:32.080 --> 11:35.720
where the hands are symmetric, as you said,

11:35.720 --> 11:38.520
but in Indian culture, the left hand is taboo

11:38.520 --> 11:41.800
and the right hand is what you use for shaking hands,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.320
for eating, for other things.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.320
And the left hand is the dirty hand that you use

11:46.320 --> 11:47.760
for wiping your own bottom.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.440
That's the toilet paper is your left hand.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.760
So while the body is anatomically symmetric,

11:52.760 --> 11:56.480
the taboo creates this pretty intense asymmetry,

11:56.480 --> 11:57.600
but for a good reason.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.960
You probably shouldn't be shaking hands with other people

11:59.960 --> 12:02.240
with the same hand that you use to kind of clean your bottom.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.480
So in that sense, it makes sense.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.360
Yeah, maybe the roots of it makes sense,

12:07.360 --> 12:10.720
but the way it propagates, especially as the times change,

12:10.720 --> 12:13.320
might not, because you can wash your hands,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.200
but the taboo remains.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.160
Right, society is very slow to change.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.640
What is the most fascinating part, function,

12:21.640 --> 12:23.880
or concept in the human body?

12:23.880 --> 12:28.880
So something that fills you with awe.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.560
I guess the most obvious one is the brain,

12:32.560 --> 12:36.680
partly because it's so sort of poorly understood,

12:36.680 --> 12:39.760
though we understand more than we ever have in the past.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.600
There's still so much that we don't understand

12:41.600 --> 12:44.600
about how the lump of matter in our skulls

12:44.600 --> 12:46.640
kind of creates this subjective experience

12:46.640 --> 12:49.720
that we all kind of understand quite viscerally.

12:50.720 --> 12:51.560
That's an easy one.

12:51.560 --> 12:54.360
I would say the kidneys are an underappreciated organ.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.560
The way they tinker with the bloodstream,

12:58.560 --> 13:01.040
raise levels of this, lower levels of that,

13:01.040 --> 13:04.880
kind of our entire lives from inside the womb

13:04.880 --> 13:07.520
until we die is just really incredible.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.160
And when you look at how much energy

13:09.160 --> 13:10.520
different organs consume,

13:10.520 --> 13:13.440
the brain and the kidneys are two of the biggest ones

13:13.440 --> 13:16.600
because the brain obviously in us is always active

13:17.560 --> 13:18.400
in controlling parts of the body,

13:18.400 --> 13:21.040
but the kidneys are just consuming a ton of energy

13:21.040 --> 13:21.880
to do what they do.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.240
They're kind of the unsung hero of the body

13:24.240 --> 13:26.080
relegated to the back of the abdomen

13:26.080 --> 13:28.400
like some forgotten organ, but they are great.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.960
I did consider being a nephrologist,

13:29.960 --> 13:31.120
which is a kidney specialist

13:31.120 --> 13:33.120
because I was so taken with the kidneys,

13:33.120 --> 13:35.240
but decided I like all the organs

13:35.240 --> 13:36.560
so couldn't pick just one.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.520
So your book is ordered in a particular way.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.120
It's throat, heart, feces, genitals,

13:44.160 --> 13:49.160
liver, pineal gland, brain, skin,

13:49.160 --> 13:54.160
urine, fat, lungs, eyes, mucus,

13:54.200 --> 13:57.280
fingers and toes and blood.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.120
All right.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.200
First of all, great chapter titles.

14:03.160 --> 14:06.520
Is there a reason for this ordering or is it all madness?

14:06.520 --> 14:09.160
There's a few different reasons that went into it.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.920
I did wanna start with the throat

14:11.920 --> 14:16.920
for the reason that it kind of presents the topic of death,

14:18.120 --> 14:20.640
which is sort of obviously very important

14:20.640 --> 14:23.160
in the training of a physician, in the career of physician.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.600
It's a big part of what I deal with.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.920
On the first day of medical school,

14:27.920 --> 14:30.240
we started the dissection of a cadaver

14:30.240 --> 14:32.080
in the class called anatomy lab.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.960
And so in a way we were kind of thrown right in there

14:34.960 --> 14:38.800
in the beginning, like this is the end of the human story,

14:38.800 --> 14:40.720
understand this, and then we sort of backed up

14:40.720 --> 14:43.800
to the beginning with embryology and reproduction and stuff.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.080
So it's kind of like we got, and I got thrown into that

14:47.080 --> 14:48.880
right away, right in the beginning,

14:48.880 --> 14:50.320
kind of like here's a dead body.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.500
Now start cutting it apart and learn the name

14:52.500 --> 14:54.960
and function of absolutely every bit of flesh.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.520
How did that change you, that first experience

14:58.520 --> 15:01.760
with the cold honesty of human biology?

15:01.760 --> 15:02.960
Right, that's exactly what it was,

15:02.960 --> 15:05.280
is cold honesty about the kind of the story

15:05.280 --> 15:06.800
of each individual human body.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.360
It has an end and that's it.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.120
I think that, well, actually before the end

15:12.120 --> 15:14.320
of that first day, so what we did on that first day

15:14.320 --> 15:16.440
was study the superficial muscles of the back,

15:16.440 --> 15:19.360
like the lats or latissimus dorsi and some other muscles.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.400
We cut through the skin of the back,

15:21.400 --> 15:24.000
my cadaver was laying face down on this metal gurney.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.880
We pulled back the kind of plastic sheets

15:25.880 --> 15:28.320
that would keep him moist for the next four months

15:28.320 --> 15:31.080
as we dissected him, cut through the skin on his back

15:31.080 --> 15:33.360
and then started dissecting through the superficial muscles

15:33.360 --> 15:34.200
of the back.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.480
And that was really all we saw that first day.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.640
We didn't get any deeper, didn't enter the abdominal

15:38.640 --> 15:41.360
or chest cavity to see internal organs,

15:41.360 --> 15:45.440
but I was so fascinated with this sort of behind the scenes

15:45.440 --> 15:47.960
look at how things work in the body,

15:47.960 --> 15:50.560
how you move your arms, how you arch your back.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.480
These are the muscles that do it,

15:52.480 --> 15:54.700
that I decided I wanted to donate my own body

15:54.700 --> 15:56.240
for the same purpose.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.440
So I made that decision literally before the end

15:58.440 --> 16:02.920
of that first day of class and I'm still sticking to it.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.360
So some day there'll be a medical student

16:05.440 --> 16:09.320
they can watch and listen to this podcast

16:09.320 --> 16:11.480
while dissecting your body.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.300
It could happen.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.480
They might not know that that person they're listening to

16:14.480 --> 16:17.160
on the podcast will be the carcass in front of them,

16:17.160 --> 16:19.000
but we never learned it.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.160
The universe will know.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.000
The universe will know.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.800
And they will acknowledge the irony or the humor,

16:24.800 --> 16:26.500
the absurdity of that.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.760
The universe will chuckle,

16:27.760 --> 16:29.920
but the medical student won't know

16:29.920 --> 16:31.920
because they never, as I did not,

16:31.920 --> 16:35.720
learn any personal information about the person,

16:35.720 --> 16:37.760
only what I could glean from looking inside him,

16:37.760 --> 16:39.000
which actually tells you quite a bit.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.160
I knew he was a smoker.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.100
I knew he had coronary artery disease.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.000
You get a window into, I knew he was overweight.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.680
You get a window into people's lives

16:46.680 --> 16:49.600
just by looking in their bodies after death.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.880
Other cadavers in the lab, not my own,

16:53.880 --> 16:55.880
or I shared one with three other students,

16:55.880 --> 16:58.960
but other cadavers, some had metal joints,

16:58.960 --> 17:01.480
like a knee replacement, some had a kidney missing.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.480
They probably, and we could tell it was surgically removed,

17:04.480 --> 17:07.000
not that he was born with one,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
and we could tell that he probably had a kidney tumor

17:09.000 --> 17:10.080
or cancer that was removed.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.600
So you do get an insight into people's lives

17:12.600 --> 17:16.040
from picking them apart after they're dead,

17:16.040 --> 17:17.280
but you don't know their name

17:17.280 --> 17:19.600
or what podcast they've been on.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.840
So as the book title says, Unseen Body,

17:23.780 --> 17:27.880
so it tells some kind of story of your life.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.920
So it does capture the decisions you've made in your life,

17:30.920 --> 17:34.280
the things you've done that might be kind of secret

17:36.440 --> 17:38.840
to that person and maybe to a few others

17:38.840 --> 17:41.680
that knew him or her well.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.840
That's so fascinating.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.000
So what kind of things can it reveal?

17:46.000 --> 17:49.840
Like what kind of choices in terms of the injuries,

17:49.840 --> 17:54.840
the catastrophic events, the lifestyle choices

17:55.880 --> 17:57.840
of smoking and diet and all those kinds of things?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.800
What can you see?

17:59.800 --> 18:03.440
What kind of history can you see about the human before you?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.880
So all those things you mentioned are things you can see.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.200
You can take the skin, for example, right?

18:08.200 --> 18:11.880
Most things that happen to us leave a mark,

18:11.880 --> 18:15.320
as I say, a story written in the language of scar

18:15.320 --> 18:16.960
where it tells you injuries you've had.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.040
And same thing with animals.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.280
I've seen deer hides that have marks

18:21.280 --> 18:23.720
that look like they're made by maybe a barbed wire fence,

18:23.720 --> 18:24.560
something like that.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.880
You can tell, sometimes it's conjecture,

18:27.880 --> 18:30.080
but you can sort of imagine what might have happened

18:30.080 --> 18:32.640
to cause that, perhaps two bucks were fighting

18:32.640 --> 18:34.760
and one got injured with an antler.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.440
And the same with humans.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.360
I have scars on my body and when I notice them,

18:39.360 --> 18:40.960
I remember what happened.

18:40.960 --> 18:45.120
I got a big cut on my hand when I was 13 and it's still there

18:45.120 --> 18:48.920
and I remember what happened every time I look at it.

18:48.920 --> 18:52.880
And so in that way, only I might know that story,

18:52.880 --> 18:54.840
but other people, when they dissect me

18:54.840 --> 18:56.040
and notice the same scars,

18:56.800 --> 19:00.080
it can fire their imagination as my cadaver did for me.

19:00.080 --> 19:02.720
They know that there is a story there.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.920
That's such an interesting way

19:03.920 --> 19:08.920
that the skin does tell a story, both tattoos and scars.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.600
Right.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.040
Some of the fun you've had

19:12.040 --> 19:14.040
and some of the damage you've done.

19:14.040 --> 19:14.880
Right.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.840
And even when I evaluate a patient,

19:16.840 --> 19:20.440
I can use scars to help me make medical decisions.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.760
So for instance, so when it comes in with abdominal pain

19:22.760 --> 19:24.200
into the emergency room,

19:24.240 --> 19:26.040
you can see scars on their abdomen

19:26.040 --> 19:29.760
that tell you about the past activities of a surgeon,

19:29.760 --> 19:30.600
perhaps.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.360
I know, I recognize the scars that are left

19:33.360 --> 19:35.160
when someone has their gallbladder removed,

19:35.160 --> 19:37.400
the scars when someone has their appendix removed,

19:37.400 --> 19:38.880
maybe when someone's had a hysterectomy

19:38.880 --> 19:42.600
and that can tell you what it might be or what it isn't.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.960
If someone doesn't have an appendix,

19:43.960 --> 19:46.600
their abdominal pain is not appendicitis, end of story.

19:46.600 --> 19:50.680
So in that way, I'm sort of looking at the tracks

19:50.680 --> 19:52.720
or the footprints of past surgeries

19:52.760 --> 19:55.320
to tell me what might and might not be the cause

19:55.320 --> 19:56.480
of this patient's abdominal pain,

19:56.480 --> 19:58.200
which is kind of my main job in the ER

19:58.200 --> 20:00.680
is figuring out what's causing it and to help them.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.560
Is there ways to get more data about the human body

20:05.560 --> 20:08.760
as we look into the future of medicine, biology,

20:08.760 --> 20:11.280
that will be helpful to fill in some of the gaps

20:11.280 --> 20:12.680
of the story?

20:12.680 --> 20:17.120
So you have companies,

20:17.120 --> 20:21.800
you have research that looks at collection of blood

20:21.800 --> 20:24.600
over long periods of time to see sort of,

20:25.760 --> 20:28.080
you know, paint a picture of what's happening in your body,

20:28.080 --> 20:29.920
mostly to help with lifestyle decisions,

20:29.920 --> 20:34.240
but also to anticipate things that can go wrong

20:34.240 --> 20:35.400
and all that kind of stuff.

20:35.400 --> 20:40.000
Is there, can you just speak to a greater digital world

20:40.000 --> 20:40.840
that we're stepping in,

20:40.840 --> 20:44.180
how that can help tell a richer story?

20:45.080 --> 20:48.720
I certainly think that we have more data

20:48.720 --> 20:50.360
than we know what to do with right now,

20:50.360 --> 20:54.280
especially with kind of direct to consumer medical devices,

20:54.280 --> 20:55.880
you know, smartwatches, et cetera,

20:55.880 --> 20:58.760
that are just collecting these reams of data.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.520
I have not seen them put to, I think,

21:01.520 --> 21:04.200
the eventual use that they will.

21:04.200 --> 21:08.120
I think that the potential is sort of just,

21:08.120 --> 21:09.640
you know, unimaginable.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.000
And I hope we're heading into a new age where,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.400
you know, you can determine, for instance,

21:14.400 --> 21:17.080
is a person gonna have more of the dangerous side effects

21:17.080 --> 21:19.120
to a drug based on their genetics,

21:19.120 --> 21:22.760
or are they gonna tolerate one drug better than the other,

21:22.760 --> 21:24.600
you know, based on their genetics?

21:24.600 --> 21:27.720
And we are slowly moving into that age,

21:27.720 --> 21:29.480
and especially the age of kind of

21:29.480 --> 21:32.520
completely synthesizing drugs in the lab.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.240
You know, much like, for instance,

21:36.240 --> 21:38.000
some of the COVID vaccines actually,

21:38.000 --> 21:41.120
like Moderna never had the virus in their lab.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.560
They made that vaccine completely

21:42.560 --> 21:44.120
without ever having the virus themselves,

21:44.120 --> 21:46.560
just by having the genome, which is sort of astounding.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.000
There's a lot of potential going forward,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.160
you know, based on that technology and some others.

21:51.160 --> 21:52.000
Oh, I didn't know that.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.920
So they basically, it's all in the computer.

21:53.920 --> 21:54.920
It's computational.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.280
Right, you have the genetic code.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.520
You have tremendous power,

21:57.520 --> 21:59.880
even if you don't have the organism itself.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.920
What do you make of Elizabeth Holmes

22:02.920 --> 22:04.640
and efforts like that?

22:04.640 --> 22:09.160
First of all, I'm a curious,

22:11.800 --> 22:16.280
I'm drawn to the darkness in human nature

22:16.280 --> 22:18.360
because that somehow reveals

22:20.400 --> 22:23.120
the full spectrum of what humans could be.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.520
So there's a lot of sort of controversial thoughts

22:25.520 --> 22:28.600
about who she is and her efforts and so on.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.960
I think you may have even tweeted about it,

22:30.960 --> 22:33.960
but I've read a lot of your tweets, so I'm not forgetting.

22:33.960 --> 22:37.440
But what do you make of her and both those efforts

22:37.440 --> 22:42.440
and the charlatans that sort of snake oil salesmen

22:42.720 --> 22:47.720
that promise those efforts to do more

22:49.200 --> 22:50.400
than they currently can?

22:51.320 --> 22:55.040
I think that her, you know, that goal that she had

22:55.040 --> 22:58.040
that she created Theranos to try to achieve,

22:58.040 --> 23:01.520
to use less blood in tests is a very worthy goal

23:01.520 --> 23:04.800
and a huge frontier that we have not achieved

23:04.800 --> 23:06.280
and that I hope we will achieve.

23:06.280 --> 23:10.560
So I understand why, you know, someone describes

23:10.560 --> 23:12.240
what a huge step forward that would be

23:13.040 --> 23:13.880
and it would be indeed.

23:13.880 --> 23:15.680
I understand why people put a ton of money behind it.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.920
Can you describe what was the promise?

23:17.920 --> 23:20.360
What are we even talking about with Theranos?

23:20.360 --> 23:22.360
What just for people who don't know?

23:22.360 --> 23:25.600
So Theranos is a company that was basically started

23:25.600 --> 23:29.720
to revolutionize the way medical blood tests are done,

23:29.720 --> 23:33.040
both to use a whole lot less blood in doing it.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.840
You know, if anyone's ever been to the doctor

23:34.840 --> 23:37.640
and had five to 10 tubes of blood removed from them,

23:37.640 --> 23:41.480
it can be quite surprising how much they take out.

23:41.640 --> 23:45.000
And it's, you know, that's the limitation of our technology

23:45.000 --> 23:46.400
that we need those volumes of blood

23:46.400 --> 23:47.800
to run all the tests that we want to.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.480
And so the promise of Theranos was that perhaps

23:50.480 --> 23:53.080
with a single drop of blood, we would be able to know

23:53.080 --> 23:57.320
as much about the person's, the condition of their body

23:57.320 --> 23:58.440
without drawing all that blood.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.600
And thereby, you know, there would be these devices

24:01.600 --> 24:03.720
she was gonna create that would sort of do it.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.320
You put a drop of blood in and it spits out

24:05.320 --> 24:06.400
everything you ever wanted to know

24:06.400 --> 24:07.480
about what's in your bloodstream.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.880
And in a way that would make it so much easier.

24:09.880 --> 24:10.720
You know, it could be,

24:10.720 --> 24:12.520
you could have one in your home theoretically.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.200
And you, I don't know why you'd wonder

24:14.200 --> 24:16.160
what your potassium level is on any given day,

24:16.160 --> 24:18.000
but you could check if you want it to.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.240
And so that goal is very worthy.

24:21.240 --> 24:25.400
You know, I put that goal up there with the frontier

24:25.400 --> 24:27.560
of making painkillers that are as good as opioids

24:27.560 --> 24:28.840
without the addictive quality.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.640
You know, that would be such a huge revolution

24:30.640 --> 24:32.040
if we did have that in medicine.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.400
But, and particularly for me,

24:34.400 --> 24:37.400
because I trained in both pediatrics and internal medicine.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.240
So I learned to care for both children and adults.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.120
In children, we do draw much less blood.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.800
They have a much lower blood volume.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.320
And we use these tiny little tubes to draw their blood.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.960
And we seemingly get equivalent information

24:49.960 --> 24:52.160
out of the larger tubes we draw from adults.

24:52.160 --> 24:53.560
And I'm still unclear to be honest

24:53.560 --> 24:56.280
why we can't draw that little amount of blood from adults.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.200
It seems technically possible.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.360
I don't know what the barriers are.

24:59.360 --> 25:02.200
I'm sure there are, or else we'd be doing it.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.840
But I do think that that is a very important goal.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.040
And if Theranos had done it,

25:06.080 --> 25:07.400
they would have really revolutionized

25:07.400 --> 25:09.040
the practice of medicine.

25:09.040 --> 25:13.920
So to return to that cadaver,

25:13.920 --> 25:18.320
that first day when you got to meet with a dead,

25:18.320 --> 25:21.120
with a human body that's no longer living.

25:21.120 --> 25:26.120
So how quickly did it take for you to get used to sort of,

25:27.920 --> 25:31.040
you said looking at the surface muscles of the back.

25:31.040 --> 25:35.000
I mean, that can be overwhelming as a thought.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.480
And people listening to this that have never dissected

25:37.480 --> 25:40.200
anything might be overwhelmed by that thought.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.640
So like how quickly were you able to get used

25:43.640 --> 25:48.520
to the brutal honesty of the biology before you?

25:48.520 --> 25:50.280
For me, it did not take long at all.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.120
I guess I've never been a squeamish person.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.880
So for me, it was kind of riveting and fascinating

25:55.880 --> 25:57.000
right from the first moment.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.280
But I do know some of my fellow classmates

26:00.280 --> 26:01.800
did have some trouble with it.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.680
Some of them I heard had nightmares

26:04.680 --> 26:08.040
in the first few weeks of anatomy lab.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.600
But then everyone, as far as I know, got used to it.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.520
And that was also actually a big lesson for me

26:13.520 --> 26:15.840
that it's pretty amazing what people can get used to

26:15.840 --> 26:16.720
in their daily lives.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.320
And I kind of extrapolated that to people living

26:19.320 --> 26:23.200
through war and through just terrible situations

26:23.200 --> 26:26.880
and living under oppressive regimes.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.080
And it really is amazing what people can get used to,

26:30.080 --> 26:31.480
almost anything.

26:32.080 --> 26:37.080
In war, people often come back and they have nightmares.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.200
They suffer through it.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.120
There's PTSD.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.240
There's a lot of complicated feelings with that.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.720
Are echoes of those same complicated feelings possible

26:47.720 --> 26:50.880
in the case of training to be and becoming a doctor?

26:51.920 --> 26:52.760
That's a good point.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.320
Yeah, I think sometimes just as a barbed wire fence

26:56.320 --> 26:58.520
can leave a scar on your skin,

26:58.560 --> 27:02.160
emotional, psychological experiences can leave a mark

27:02.160 --> 27:03.840
on your brain or your memory.

27:03.840 --> 27:08.840
And I think that definitely could be a problem

27:09.720 --> 27:10.760
in medical training.

27:10.760 --> 27:14.160
You do see a lot of things that are very shocking,

27:14.160 --> 27:17.000
very repulsive, things that you'd never forget.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
I know one of those students that had nightmares initially

27:20.000 --> 27:21.440
went on to be a surgeon.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.800
So I imagine she's not having the PTSD

27:23.800 --> 27:25.960
of kind of seeing inside her first dead body

27:25.960 --> 27:28.600
because she sees inside them all day every day now.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.840
But I'm sure it could.

27:30.840 --> 27:35.720
We go on to see so many kind of grosser or more shocking

27:35.720 --> 27:38.000
things in medical training through medical school

27:38.000 --> 27:40.480
and then by working with actual living patients,

27:40.480 --> 27:43.560
not just dead and embalmed bodies.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.680
So I do think that things can leave a mark,

27:46.680 --> 27:49.040
but I don't think that initial cadaver

27:49.040 --> 27:50.440
would be the most traumatic.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.640
Yeah, but maybe some of that trauma,

27:54.640 --> 27:57.000
the demons make you a better surgeon,

27:57.000 --> 28:00.560
just like some of your own psychological trauma

28:00.560 --> 28:03.120
might make you a better psychiatrist.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.720
Returning to the ordering.

28:05.840 --> 28:09.800
Is it order or is it chaos to the ordering of the chapters

28:09.800 --> 28:13.880
from throat and heart and feces and genitals

28:13.880 --> 28:16.760
all the way to fingers and toes and blood?

28:16.760 --> 28:18.560
So I did mention that, you know,

28:18.560 --> 28:19.560
throat was the first one,

28:19.560 --> 28:21.600
because I kind of wanted to throw the reader

28:21.600 --> 28:24.600
right into the brutal honesty of death.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.160
And I followed it up with feces as the third chapter

28:28.160 --> 28:32.560
in a way, partly to also throw them right into the deep end

28:32.560 --> 28:35.440
of how I like discussing parts of the body

28:35.440 --> 28:38.640
and revealing their gross and fascinating aspects.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.440
So I didn't want to hide anything.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.080
You know, when you train to be a doctor,

28:42.080 --> 28:45.320
everything is on the table, literally, in the cadaver lab,

28:45.320 --> 28:48.080
but also just, you know, you deal with blood and piss

28:48.080 --> 28:51.160
and vomit and feces, and that's kind of the medium

28:51.160 --> 28:52.000
of your craft.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.840
Yes, the medium of the craft, that's right.

28:54.840 --> 28:55.680
Right.

28:55.680 --> 29:00.200
Like if you're a painter, this is the paint that you wear.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.040
Exactly.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.320
And then you have to create a masterpiece with it.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.920
Like almost like a dance, because there's multiple painters.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.920
One of the painters is the biology.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.400
So let's return to throat.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.040
You mentioned it's a weird one.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.760
So first of all, a friend of mine said,

29:14.760 --> 29:19.640
I just see humans as like a bunch of holes

29:19.640 --> 29:21.560
that just walk around.

29:24.080 --> 29:24.920
Not untrue.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.480
It's a funny way to look at humans.

29:27.480 --> 29:31.720
So we have ears, we have nose, we have mouth,

29:31.720 --> 29:36.720
we have the sexual holes, vagina, penis,

29:37.040 --> 29:40.600
and then, you know, what's the medical term

29:40.600 --> 29:41.800
for your asshole?

29:42.760 --> 29:44.360
Anus. Anus, thank you.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.240
This is a very technical discussion.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.600
The rectum's further in, don't confuse the two.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.480
Oh, that's very important.

29:51.480 --> 29:54.000
Is there a difference between throat and mouth?

29:54.000 --> 29:56.080
By the way, so when you say throat,

29:56.080 --> 30:00.880
are we talking about when that hole actually becomes tubular?

30:00.880 --> 30:03.600
The throat, I would count as just sort of the very back

30:03.600 --> 30:06.080
of the, you know, the back of the mouth,

30:06.080 --> 30:08.600
where the nose also comes down and meets it,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.480
where the tonsils are and the uvula.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.200
But you're right that, you know, we are a bunch of holes,

30:13.200 --> 30:15.160
but more accurately, we're a tube, right?

30:15.160 --> 30:18.600
We start in the womb as kind of this microscopic little disc,

30:18.600 --> 30:21.920
almost like a, you know, a flatbread,

30:21.920 --> 30:25.920
and then we roll almost like a burrito into this tube,

30:25.920 --> 30:27.600
and we're a simple microscopic tube,

30:27.600 --> 30:30.160
and from there, we grow into this bigger and bigger tube,

30:30.160 --> 30:32.120
and we become more complicated,

30:32.120 --> 30:35.080
and each end of the tube does split into various holes.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.120
So all the holes you mentioned at the front end of the tube,

30:37.120 --> 30:39.920
the front end of our body, right, it splits into the nose,

30:39.920 --> 30:44.920
the mouth, the ears, the sinuses, the tube to the lungs,

30:45.080 --> 30:47.080
which is the windpipe, the tube down to the stomach,

30:47.080 --> 30:48.760
which is the esophagus,

30:48.760 --> 30:51.480
and then the other end of the tube splits as well.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.880
You know, men end up with two holes,

30:53.880 --> 30:56.720
and women end up with three holes, you know,

30:56.720 --> 30:59.360
the urethra, the vagina, and the anus, and men just,

30:59.360 --> 31:02.360
you know, the urethra and kind of the reproductive system,

31:02.360 --> 31:03.320
they share a hole.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.800
So I'm learning a lot today.

31:05.800 --> 31:10.160
It really is incredible that you start from sperm and egg,

31:10.160 --> 31:12.360
and you have some DNA information,

31:12.360 --> 31:15.520
and from that, the building project begins,

31:15.560 --> 31:20.560
and then what that leads to is like a pizza dough,

31:20.880 --> 31:24.120
and then you roll it into a tube,

31:24.120 --> 31:29.120
and that tube then eventually sort of becomes

31:29.480 --> 31:34.480
more and more complicated and gets eyes and a brain,

31:34.680 --> 31:38.480
and then can create a Twitter account.

31:38.480 --> 31:43.480
So it's really incredible that we're just a fancy tube.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.240
Right, we are, and we sprout eyes and a brain

31:47.240 --> 31:49.080
and a sense of smell and taste,

31:49.080 --> 31:51.880
pretty much to regulate what comes in the front of the tube.

31:51.880 --> 31:55.040
You know, we don't wanna eat anything dangerous or poisonous.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.440
You know, we wanna choose what we eat,

31:57.440 --> 31:58.520
even choose who we kiss.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.880
Well, we seem to be motivated

31:59.880 --> 32:04.000
by what comes out of the tube as well, in part.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.680
I mean, that's not just output.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.880
It's a feedback mechanism, seemingly.

32:07.880 --> 32:11.080
Like, we're also monitoring the functioning of the output.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.120
We're not just obsessed about the input.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.680
We're very obsessed with the output.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.920
You're absolutely right about that.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.480
People have medical complaints

32:20.480 --> 32:22.720
about their output very often that are,

32:22.720 --> 32:24.880
you know, I never cease to be surprised

32:24.880 --> 32:28.080
by a new kind of complaint or observation about the output.

32:28.080 --> 32:32.360
I think people have gone to wars over the output,

32:32.360 --> 32:35.000
and maybe sometimes the lack of the output,

32:35.000 --> 32:38.600
or the desire for output for the particular other humans

32:39.480 --> 32:44.400
that you fancy, the brain and the eyes that sprouted

32:44.400 --> 32:48.120
somehow convinced the rest of the body

32:48.120 --> 32:51.800
that this one particular other tube is fanciful.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.440
So you're going to go to major wars

32:53.440 --> 32:57.440
and lead global suffering because of the fancy

32:57.440 --> 33:01.640
and the desire for additional output with the other tube.

33:01.640 --> 33:06.640
Okay, so that's, so on the throat, that part of the tube,

33:09.480 --> 33:13.560
is it, you said the design is not,

33:13.560 --> 33:16.280
you could have thought of maybe a little bit better options

33:16.280 --> 33:18.320
because it's too multifunctional.

33:18.320 --> 33:20.800
Is that, can you sort of elaborate

33:20.800 --> 33:23.760
on the multifunctional nature of this part?

33:23.760 --> 33:26.440
Are a lot of parts of the human body multifunctional,

33:26.440 --> 33:29.480
or do you find that more specialization

33:29.480 --> 33:32.320
is going to get the job done better?

33:32.320 --> 33:34.120
There is a lot of organs, for instance,

33:34.120 --> 33:35.600
do have multiple functions.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.560
The pancreas has two, is like two organs in one.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.520
One secretes hormones like insulin into the bloodstream

33:42.520 --> 33:46.000
and the other aspect of it secretes digestive enzymes

33:46.000 --> 33:49.240
into the gut to help you digest and absorb food.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.120
The liver is like 15 organs in one.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.880
It's just amazing how many different things it does.

33:53.880 --> 33:57.520
But the throat, so basically the problem with the throat

33:57.520 --> 34:00.680
is as I said, we have two tubes that are right next

34:00.680 --> 34:01.880
to each other in the throat.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.400
One is for food, drink, saliva, mucus, snot,

34:05.440 --> 34:07.160
whatever you're going to swallow.

34:07.160 --> 34:09.320
All of that stuff must go down the esophagus,

34:09.320 --> 34:11.480
the food tube and end up in the stomach.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.000
And right next to the esophagus,

34:13.000 --> 34:16.360
millimeters away is the windpipe or the trachea,

34:16.360 --> 34:18.480
which goes down to the lungs.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.960
And your throat does these daily gymnastics

34:21.960 --> 34:26.400
to keep everything but air out of the windpipe

34:26.400 --> 34:30.280
because you slip up once and you can die.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.880
You can choke, you laugh or speak while eating

34:32.880 --> 34:35.120
and it's curtains, unfortunately.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.440
So it seems like every aspect of the body

34:37.440 --> 34:38.840
when I was learning about it in med school

34:38.840 --> 34:43.480
seems so brilliant and so perfectly designed by evolution

34:43.480 --> 34:45.480
or whoever you might think designed it

34:46.360 --> 34:50.600
to favor survival, to enhance life.

34:51.680 --> 34:53.720
But the throat seemed the opposite.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.840
It seemed set up almost for failure.

34:56.680 --> 34:59.160
And we developed all these mechanisms

34:59.160 --> 35:00.360
as a compensation, right?

35:00.360 --> 35:04.000
We have the gag reflex whenever food or something

35:04.040 --> 35:06.360
is headed towards your air pipe,

35:06.360 --> 35:08.160
your windpipe or down to your lungs,

35:08.160 --> 35:10.640
your throat has this sort of rejection of it.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.200
It pushes it away in a gag reflex.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.480
At the same time, we have a cough,

35:14.480 --> 35:16.400
which is something our body does

35:16.400 --> 35:19.040
when something inappropriate does get down the windpipe.

35:19.040 --> 35:22.240
When we get a little food down the wrong pipe,

35:22.240 --> 35:24.760
we end up coughing and the coughing does

35:24.760 --> 35:27.360
usually flush it out and get rid of it.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.960
We even have something called the mucus elevator

35:29.960 --> 35:33.080
in our lungs, which is this constant flow

35:33.120 --> 35:35.800
of mucus up the airways, up to the trachea,

35:35.800 --> 35:37.920
dragging with it all kinds of particulates

35:37.920 --> 35:40.120
that we've inhaled and perhaps some food

35:40.120 --> 35:42.200
that went down the wrong pipe and drags it up

35:42.200 --> 35:44.280
into the throat and we swallow it

35:44.280 --> 35:47.120
kind of unconsciously all day, every day is the truth.

35:47.120 --> 35:50.160
Even the mechanism of swallowing is super complicated.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.240
It uses a number of cranial nerves.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.520
It uses over 15 different muscles.

35:55.520 --> 36:00.360
It's this coordinated act to keep food out of the airway.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.400
You can see someone's Adam's apple in their neck

36:02.760 --> 36:05.120
jump upward when they swallow,

36:05.120 --> 36:09.200
which helps lift the airway up against the epiglottis,

36:09.200 --> 36:12.960
which plugs it closed and allows food or swallow drink

36:12.960 --> 36:15.000
to kind of skirt just past it.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.440
But every time we swallow, those things do come

36:17.440 --> 36:19.760
within millimeters of going down the wrong pipe.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.400
And it's just thanks to these kind of compensations,

36:22.400 --> 36:25.040
these adaptations we have to the danger of the throat

36:25.040 --> 36:26.200
that keeps us alive.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.200
As I actually took a sip of water,

36:30.360 --> 36:34.240
it's kind of, it makes you appreciate

36:34.240 --> 36:36.000
the wonderful machinery of it all.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.560
By the way, we have pulled up your Instagram

36:39.560 --> 36:41.040
that people should follow.

36:41.040 --> 36:44.120
You have a post about the throat

36:44.120 --> 36:47.640
and just showing so many different components

36:47.640 --> 36:52.280
from the tongue to the trachea, the esophagus,

36:52.280 --> 36:54.760
just the entire machinery of it all.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.240
The teeth for the chewing.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.160
It's so interesting.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.520
And so a lot of the structure of this,

37:02.520 --> 37:05.200
the anatomy and the physiology,

37:05.200 --> 37:07.640
does it echo other mammals?

37:07.640 --> 37:11.040
Are we just basically borrowing a lot of stuff

37:11.040 --> 37:14.160
from evolution and maybe making small adjustments

37:14.160 --> 37:16.960
maybe due to the fact that we're not using our mouth

37:16.960 --> 37:21.240
to murder things as other predators might?

37:22.200 --> 37:23.520
We use our thumbs.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.520
Exactly, we have hands, we don't need to bite them.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.800
Yeah, there's a lot of overlap between different animals,

37:29.800 --> 37:32.960
which I find very comforting and fascinating.

37:32.960 --> 37:33.800
Someone asked me,

37:33.800 --> 37:36.680
is there any animal in which the throat is better designed?

37:36.680 --> 37:38.520
And my first thought was whales

37:38.520 --> 37:40.720
because the blowhole is kind of up on the top of their head.

37:40.720 --> 37:44.240
So I was thinking, oh, maybe they are more separate.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.160
But when I looked into it, actually no.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.960
The paths do come very close, just like in us.

37:48.960 --> 37:53.240
And I saw a paper about some new discovered organ

37:53.240 --> 37:55.360
that actually helps keep food and drink

37:55.360 --> 37:56.760
out of the airway in whales

37:56.760 --> 37:58.240
that they hadn't ever noticed before.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.000
So it's a different mechanism,

38:00.000 --> 38:01.880
but the same kind of basic problem

38:01.880 --> 38:05.120
is that we're tubes and the air tube and food tube

38:05.120 --> 38:06.520
are right next to each other.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.000
How well do we understand,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.400
so just even lingering on this little part,

38:10.400 --> 38:13.800
is there still mysteries about the complexity of the system?

38:13.800 --> 38:16.400
Because you mentioned just even for swallowing

38:16.400 --> 38:18.480
all these parts in the brain that are responsible

38:18.480 --> 38:20.720
and all the different things that have to,

38:20.720 --> 38:22.720
like an orchestra play together.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.320
Do we have a good sense from both a medical perspective

38:26.320 --> 38:29.040
and a biology perspective, or is there still mysteries?

38:29.040 --> 38:30.440
There's definitely still mysteries.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.440
We understand a lot about, for instance,

38:32.440 --> 38:35.880
how the swallowing mechanism is coordinated

38:35.880 --> 38:37.120
in the brain stem,

38:37.120 --> 38:40.120
sometimes using some higher levels of the brain.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.040
But it is a very thoughtless thing,

38:42.040 --> 38:44.040
as you mentioned when you drank the water.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.840
It's not something we have to think about, thankfully,

38:45.840 --> 38:47.680
or we'd be thinking about it all day.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.160
There's a lot we don't understand

38:50.160 --> 38:51.880
about the basic mechanisms perhaps

38:51.880 --> 38:53.960
about how the nerves fire

38:53.960 --> 38:58.280
and how they kind of coordinate on the microscopic level,

38:58.280 --> 39:01.240
how ions rush into and out of nerve cells

39:01.240 --> 39:03.200
to kind of create that electrical signal.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.680
But we sure understand a heck of a lot,

39:05.680 --> 39:07.040
and it's very fascinating.

39:07.920 --> 39:12.160
So moving on to chapter two, we'll jump around.

39:12.160 --> 39:17.160
And you actually said the liver does a lot of things.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.600
I also saw you retweet something

39:20.600 --> 39:23.440
where it said, you know,

39:23.440 --> 39:25.920
showing that the liver is bigger than the heart,

39:25.920 --> 39:29.040
which is the body or the universe's way of saying

39:29.040 --> 39:32.800
you should drink more and care less, which is a good line.

39:32.800 --> 39:37.520
So you give props, like you said, to the kidney,

39:37.520 --> 39:40.640
to the liver, to the maybe, to the organs,

39:40.640 --> 39:44.040
to the parts that don't often get as much credit

39:44.040 --> 39:48.360
as they deserve, but let us go for time to the human heart.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.640
We get chest pain.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.680
We talk about it when we talk about love for some reason.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.680
Why do we talk about the heart when we talk about love?

39:58.680 --> 40:00.920
There sometimes can actually be some chest pain

40:00.920 --> 40:01.840
involved in love.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.720
I remember when I was a med student,

40:03.720 --> 40:06.720
I was very smitten with another medical student.

40:06.720 --> 40:09.240
It was totally brilliant and beautiful.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.680
And it actually does cause this kind of burning

40:11.680 --> 40:12.520
in your chest.

40:12.520 --> 40:13.840
I don't know what that is.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.960
I don't think it's from the heart itself.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.720
I don't know if it was like acid reflux

40:17.720 --> 40:20.000
because I was so nervous, I'm not really sure.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.480
But I definitely felt something in my chest

40:22.480 --> 40:23.680
whenever I saw her.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.720
I don't know what that is.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.720
But you could see why someone might think,

40:26.720 --> 40:28.120
oh, maybe it is your heart.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.640
That's kind of the most prominent organ in your chest.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.360
When people come to the ER with chest pain,

40:32.360 --> 40:33.960
the big question is, is it my heart?

40:33.960 --> 40:36.920
And my main job is figuring out if it is or not.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.120
So I could see why.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.280
The way ancients saw the functions of different organs

40:42.280 --> 40:46.320
is fascinating, but often hard to explain.

40:46.320 --> 40:49.720
Would it be fair to say that if you look at the entirety

40:49.720 --> 40:53.280
of human history, the way most people die

40:53.280 --> 40:55.480
has to do with the heart?

40:55.480 --> 40:59.240
Well, like in America today, cardiovascular disease

40:59.240 --> 41:02.600
and coronary artery disease is one of the most common,

41:02.600 --> 41:05.360
perhaps the most common cause of death.

41:05.360 --> 41:08.480
100 years ago, 200 years ago, it was probably not.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.520
People were not living as long and people were dying

41:10.520 --> 41:14.240
of infections that we tend to die less of these days.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.600
Sure, that's true.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.920
But in terms of things to stab,

41:18.960 --> 41:21.120
so I'm trying to sort of introspect like,

41:21.120 --> 41:24.600
why talk about the heart and love?

41:25.480 --> 41:28.760
My thought would be that it's because the heart

41:28.760 --> 41:31.800
was seen as the most important organism.

41:31.800 --> 41:35.760
It would be like the origin of life comes from the heart.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.360
The originator of life and the way you figure that out

41:38.360 --> 41:43.360
from sort of an ancient perspective is when you stab things,

41:43.800 --> 41:46.120
what is likely to lead to issues.

41:46.120 --> 41:48.760
It's like, it's possible to imagine that the brain

41:48.760 --> 41:52.320
is not as special as we might think from

41:52.320 --> 41:56.640
when you don't understand modern biology or physiology

41:56.640 --> 41:58.640
or neuroscience, all those kinds of things,

41:58.640 --> 42:01.880
especially because pain, you know, it's painless too

42:02.880 --> 42:05.560
if you stab it, the brain, I mean.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.880
Yeah, anyway, so that's really interesting.

42:09.880 --> 42:13.480
I'm sure there's a kind of a poetic answer to

42:13.480 --> 42:15.280
maybe the way people wrote about it,

42:15.280 --> 42:20.280
but what to you is the wisdom in the design of the heart?

42:20.680 --> 42:22.480
I mean, the main function of the heart basically

42:22.480 --> 42:25.280
is to push blood through the cardiovascular system,

42:25.280 --> 42:27.800
through the branching blood vessels

42:27.800 --> 42:30.400
to feed every cell in the body.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.320
You know, when I believe our ancestors started off

42:33.320 --> 42:37.320
as single-celled organisms floating in some ancient brew

42:37.320 --> 42:39.400
and they were surrounded by the medium

42:39.400 --> 42:41.080
that would bring them all the nutrients they needed,

42:41.080 --> 42:42.560
so there's no issues there.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.800
And then once you start getting multicellular organisms

42:45.800 --> 42:47.800
that are thicker and the ones on the inside

42:47.800 --> 42:50.560
aren't in contact with that sort of nutritious brew

42:50.560 --> 42:52.320
that they're growing in,

42:52.320 --> 42:54.760
you kind of need a way to distribute those nutrients

42:54.760 --> 42:56.600
to every cell, and so that's what the heart

42:56.600 --> 42:58.600
and the branching vascular tree do.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.480
So the heart, you know, it's the most,

43:01.480 --> 43:03.960
the biggest disconnect between how the organs talked about

43:03.960 --> 43:06.880
in poetry and through history versus its actual function

43:06.880 --> 43:09.200
is probably the heart, because we ascribe all these things

43:09.200 --> 43:13.280
like love and passion and life itself sometimes to the heart,

43:13.280 --> 43:15.760
but actually it's just a simple mechanical pump,

43:15.760 --> 43:17.200
you know, that's all it is.

43:17.200 --> 43:18.720
I don't wanna downplay it, it's amazing,

43:18.720 --> 43:20.440
but you know, it just pushes.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.560
It fills the blood and then squeezes it,

43:22.560 --> 43:23.600
fills the blood and squeezes it,

43:23.600 --> 43:25.280
and just that squeezing, that pushing

43:25.280 --> 43:28.440
creates the blood pressure that you need to get blood

43:28.440 --> 43:29.800
to every cell in your body,

43:29.800 --> 43:31.240
especially when you're standing upright

43:31.240 --> 43:32.800
to get blood to your brain,

43:32.800 --> 43:35.520
you need a certain amount of pressure to get it up there.

43:35.520 --> 43:39.320
Isn't it amazing to you how much volume of blood

43:39.320 --> 43:43.000
just gets pushed through by this pump?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.160
Absolutely, they say every red blood cell

43:45.160 --> 43:47.280
takes about five minutes to circulate

43:47.280 --> 43:48.840
and come back to the heart,

43:48.840 --> 43:50.440
and that circulation kind of, you know,

43:50.440 --> 43:52.840
starts in the womb and continues

43:52.840 --> 43:55.560
and kind of until the moment that we die,

43:55.560 --> 43:56.880
but the volume is tremendous,

43:56.880 --> 44:00.160
and it can never, you know, take a break basically.

44:00.160 --> 44:03.920
And it's sort of propagating all kinds of stuff

44:03.920 --> 44:06.160
throughout the body, it's a delivery mechanism,

44:06.160 --> 44:09.720
blood for all kinds of good stuff and bad stuff,

44:09.720 --> 44:14.160
nutrition, drugs, all that.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.200
Medications too.

44:15.200 --> 44:19.040
Medications, such a fascinating design.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
And it also takes the waste away, you know,

44:21.040 --> 44:22.920
it kind of brings the nutritious stuff,

44:22.920 --> 44:24.600
brings the nutrients, especially oxygen,

44:24.600 --> 44:26.840
but many other things, and then it also,

44:26.840 --> 44:29.040
as it passes the cell, takes the cell's waste,

44:29.040 --> 44:30.960
so it's sort of the freshwater

44:30.960 --> 44:33.480
and the sewage system in one.

44:33.480 --> 44:38.480
So about blood, what to use fascinating about blood?

44:38.840 --> 44:41.760
So we talk about the pump that spreads the blood,

44:41.760 --> 44:43.200
but the blood itself.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.960
Right, so the blood itself is sort of,

44:44.960 --> 44:47.840
I mean, it's the most important bodily fluid, of course.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.320
You know, from moment to moment,

44:49.320 --> 44:52.040
every cell in the body needs a flow of blood

44:53.320 --> 44:55.400
to bring it, most importantly oxygen,

44:55.400 --> 44:57.040
but also, again, all the other nutrients

44:57.040 --> 44:59.120
and to take away waste, and if that stops

44:59.120 --> 45:02.400
for even a few moments, you can be in big trouble.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.760
So blood is sort of, you know, the most important medium.

45:05.760 --> 45:09.320
It's also, doctors use it to kind of evaluate the body.

45:09.320 --> 45:12.640
It does have this kind of all-seeing quality to it,

45:12.640 --> 45:16.720
where, you know, we can evaluate organs through the blood.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.920
I can tell you about your liver, your heart, your kidney,

45:18.920 --> 45:21.240
just by taking a sample of your blood.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.840
So it's sort of like this crystal ball in a way,

45:23.840 --> 45:26.000
and we use it kind of all the time, you know,

45:26.000 --> 45:29.080
to assess someone's health, to assess their disease.

45:29.080 --> 45:33.080
Is it also the attack vector for diseases,

45:34.520 --> 45:37.680
for bacteria, for viruses and all that kind of stuff?

45:37.680 --> 45:40.480
So viruses seem to attack either the throat,

45:40.480 --> 45:41.480
maybe you can correct me,

45:41.480 --> 45:44.120
but they seem to attack different parts of the body,

45:44.120 --> 45:46.160
depending on how easy it is to access

45:46.160 --> 45:50.560
and how easy it is to get in deep,

45:50.560 --> 45:52.280
depending on what you prefer.

45:52.280 --> 45:54.400
If you wanna do a little bit of hard work,

45:54.400 --> 45:58.520
but you get in deep, or you don't wanna do the hard work,

45:58.520 --> 45:59.800
but you don't get in deep,

45:59.800 --> 46:01.320
those are the choices viruses have.

46:01.320 --> 46:04.320
But is blood one of the sort of attack vectors?

46:04.320 --> 46:07.320
What's like, if you were trying to break into the human body,

46:08.440 --> 46:13.040
like a parasite, a virus, a bacteria, how would you do it?

46:13.040 --> 46:16.240
Like, what would be the attack vectors you would explore?

46:16.240 --> 46:17.080
Right, so you gotta look

46:17.080 --> 46:19.400
for the body's weaknesses, of course.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.680
You know, we have inherent weaknesses, for instance,

46:21.680 --> 46:22.880
like our respiratory tract.

46:22.880 --> 46:26.640
We have to breathe, we have to get air in from the outside,

46:26.640 --> 46:28.680
and so that's one of the entries into the body.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.520
And so, you know, when we inhale,

46:30.520 --> 46:33.440
let's say a poisonous gas, you know, it's an easy way in.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.880
You have to breathe, you can't hold your breath very long,

46:35.880 --> 46:39.800
but, you know, air in our lungs is still kind of contiguous

46:39.800 --> 46:41.360
with the external atmosphere.

46:41.360 --> 46:44.440
It's not really inside the body until it does cross

46:44.440 --> 46:47.400
across the lining of the alveoli into the blood,

46:47.400 --> 46:49.960
as you said, that's when it really gets inside.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.480
And the other, besides the respiratory tract,

46:51.480 --> 46:53.960
the gastrointestinal tract is another way,

46:53.960 --> 46:55.160
kind of a chink in the armor.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.480
You know, we have to eat, we have to drink,

46:57.480 --> 46:59.400
and therefore we're taking the external world

46:59.400 --> 47:02.600
into ourselves, into our gut, in order to extract from it

47:02.600 --> 47:05.360
what we need and let the rest kind of flow out.

47:05.360 --> 47:08.080
So those two, the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract,

47:08.080 --> 47:09.480
you know, there's a reason that, you know,

47:09.480 --> 47:13.000
respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal infections

47:13.000 --> 47:15.240
are kind of the most common that afflict us

47:15.240 --> 47:17.800
because those are the ways in to the body.

47:17.800 --> 47:20.120
So I would definitely pick one of those,

47:20.120 --> 47:22.080
not just be a lazy cold in the nose,

47:22.080 --> 47:24.440
but really a more aggressive pneumonia down deep

47:24.440 --> 47:27.040
in the lungs and get across that barrier into the blood.

47:27.040 --> 47:32.040
But also the whole sex thing that humans do.

47:32.080 --> 47:36.200
So speaking of which, let us go for time

47:36.200 --> 47:38.440
to the genitals chapter.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.240
So what are genitals?

47:41.240 --> 47:43.360
I think I've heard of those.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.920
I think I've read about a penis and a vagina.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.880
Can you explain to me how those work?

47:48.880 --> 47:51.120
Just asking for a friend, but also,

47:52.240 --> 47:54.200
what do you use fascinating about it

47:55.000 --> 47:58.840
and maybe what's misunderstood or little known about them?

48:00.160 --> 48:03.400
Sure, so they're very unique organs, I would say.

48:03.400 --> 48:06.040
One of the things that I like to point out is that,

48:06.040 --> 48:08.640
you know, while every organ from moment to moment

48:08.640 --> 48:10.800
keeps us alive and ensures our survival,

48:10.800 --> 48:12.760
the genitals are in a way the opposite.

48:12.760 --> 48:15.680
You know, we don't need them from moment to moment.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.840
You don't even have to use them at all.

48:17.840 --> 48:20.000
And in fact, they often make us do stupid things

48:20.000 --> 48:23.080
that are the opposite of kind of enhancing survival.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.400
And they've affected the brain

48:26.400 --> 48:29.120
and you can become sort of focused and nuts

48:29.120 --> 48:31.880
based on those desires that kind of stem from the genitals.

48:31.880 --> 48:34.000
So they can be dangerous organs too.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.800
But you know, I mean, sexual dimorphism

48:36.800 --> 48:39.520
helps with genetic variability

48:39.520 --> 48:41.520
as it does in so many other organisms.

48:41.520 --> 48:42.720
You know, you take two people

48:42.720 --> 48:44.280
and mix them together, their genetics.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.080
You just get a lot more variation

48:46.080 --> 48:50.400
and more opportunities to try different genetic codes

48:50.400 --> 48:52.160
and see what'll enhance survival.

48:52.280 --> 48:54.360
We talked about sex and death.

48:54.360 --> 48:55.920
I talk about in the book a lot of,

48:55.920 --> 48:57.720
for instance, the female genital tract,

48:57.720 --> 49:00.080
how the uterus is very unusual

49:00.080 --> 49:02.760
because, you know, it doesn't even sort of wake up

49:02.760 --> 49:05.520
and start doing its thing until the second decade of life.

49:05.520 --> 49:09.520
You know, even though babies,

49:09.520 --> 49:12.120
female babies are born with all of the eggs

49:12.120 --> 49:14.240
they'll ever have in their ovaries already,

49:14.240 --> 49:15.960
they're just sort of in this stasis

49:15.960 --> 49:18.960
until they start waking up kind of once a month.

49:18.960 --> 49:20.480
And it's this cycle, you know,

49:20.480 --> 49:21.520
there's so much in our bodies

49:21.520 --> 49:23.040
that are cyclical and rhythmic,

49:23.040 --> 49:25.320
the heartbeat, the breathing.

49:25.320 --> 49:28.640
But menstruation is kind of a very strange rhythm

49:28.640 --> 49:31.320
that takes over a decade to start.

49:31.320 --> 49:34.080
And only, you know, the rhythm beats once a month,

49:34.080 --> 49:35.720
which is very slow compared

49:35.720 --> 49:37.480
to every other rhythm of the body.

49:37.480 --> 49:40.360
The other unusual thing is, you know, in medicine,

49:40.360 --> 49:43.280
when rhythms of the body cease, when they stop,

49:43.280 --> 49:44.720
those are emergencies, right?

49:44.720 --> 49:47.040
When your heart stops, that's a cardiac arrest.

49:47.040 --> 49:50.160
You need CPR, maybe an electric shock to restart it.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.920
When your breathing stops, you know,

49:51.920 --> 49:53.720
you need a breathing machine to breathe for you

49:53.720 --> 49:56.080
or something to reverse whatever might be causing

49:56.080 --> 49:58.080
the suppression of your breathing.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.960
But when menstruation stops,

49:59.960 --> 50:03.520
it's the point of menstruation in the first place.

50:03.520 --> 50:06.160
The whole reason that the uterus grows a lining

50:06.160 --> 50:09.360
and sheds it each month is to one day, you know,

50:09.360 --> 50:11.720
get fertil, the ovum to get fertilized

50:11.720 --> 50:13.440
and for it to implant in the lining.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.560
And then the rhythm ceases.

50:14.560 --> 50:16.640
And that's obviously not a medical emergency,

50:16.640 --> 50:19.120
unlike most other rhythms, you know, cessations.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.560
It's the point of the whole thing in the first place.

50:21.560 --> 50:25.960
So these particular penis and vagina are that whole thing,

50:25.960 --> 50:27.000
the uterus, whatever.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Am I not using the wrong terms?

50:29.000 --> 50:29.840
I don't know.

50:29.840 --> 50:31.080
I'll just keep saying.

50:31.080 --> 50:32.240
You use those terms.

50:32.240 --> 50:35.360
There's more technical, there's parts, various parts.

50:35.360 --> 50:38.040
In medical school, you learn every bump

50:38.040 --> 50:41.320
and, you know, every little part of every little organ,

50:41.320 --> 50:42.760
including the genitals, so.

50:43.920 --> 50:47.960
I never really thought of it this way, as you said,

50:47.960 --> 50:51.520
is that most organs are kind of full-time employees,

50:51.520 --> 50:54.320
like 24-7, they're doing something.

50:54.320 --> 50:56.120
And then there's some organs,

50:57.560 --> 51:00.960
penis or vagina being representative of this,

51:00.960 --> 51:03.320
they're not functioning all the time.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.440
They're only functioning every once in a while

51:05.440 --> 51:08.600
and then get us to do stupid stuff or awesome stuff

51:08.600 --> 51:09.600
and all that kind of stuff.

51:09.600 --> 51:11.760
But they're not essential for human survival

51:11.760 --> 51:14.280
on a second-by-second basis.

51:14.280 --> 51:18.360
And then the whole cyclical nature of the human body.

51:18.360 --> 51:20.960
How many other cycles are on a monthly basis,

51:20.960 --> 51:23.440
like that far apart?

51:23.440 --> 51:25.920
That's a fascinating design

51:25.920 --> 51:27.160
that the human body would do that

51:27.160 --> 51:32.160
and wouldn't start until the second decade of life.

51:32.520 --> 51:35.800
It's almost like, what do I wanna say?

51:35.800 --> 51:40.000
There's some kind of meta-planning going on.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.960
Like, this is the optimal solution

51:41.960 --> 51:44.480
for the sexual selection mechanism

51:44.480 --> 51:48.640
among somewhat intelligent species.

51:48.640 --> 51:53.400
It's useful to, after the brain has developed

51:53.400 --> 51:57.120
sufficiently long to now be making

51:57.120 --> 51:59.200
sexual selection decisions.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.560
You need time for this computer,

52:01.560 --> 52:04.360
this really powerful computer, to load in the info.

52:05.800 --> 52:06.640
Interesting.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.440
You also need the body to develop.

52:08.440 --> 52:11.800
A child simply isn't big enough to be pregnant

52:12.640 --> 52:14.400
and deliver another baby.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.560
I wonder if there's animals in which this happens

52:16.560 --> 52:19.240
at a much more accelerated pace in different stages.

52:19.240 --> 52:21.680
Definitely, especially certain kinds of insects,

52:21.680 --> 52:25.320
like Drosophila, a lot of the fruit fly,

52:25.320 --> 52:26.600
a lot of experiments are done on

52:26.600 --> 52:28.760
because their life cycle is so rapid.

52:28.760 --> 52:31.400
A lot of insects and other creatures

52:31.400 --> 52:34.560
are almost ready to mate as soon as they're born.

52:34.560 --> 52:35.600
Not us.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.640
Not us.

52:36.640 --> 52:41.640
Is there any improvements to the design?

52:42.800 --> 52:45.400
So a lot of people are very interested

52:45.400 --> 52:47.800
in these particular body parts.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.680
If you were to sort of step back

52:49.680 --> 52:53.000
as a geneticist, biological designer,

52:53.000 --> 52:55.520
or maybe a computer scientist, computer engineer

52:55.520 --> 53:00.520
trying to build human 2.0, or maybe a robot,

53:00.640 --> 53:04.240
how would you improve the penis and the vagina?

53:05.400 --> 53:06.800
Well, the penis, for starters,

53:06.800 --> 53:09.280
I mean, let's also discuss the testicles.

53:09.280 --> 53:10.800
You know, they're very important too.

53:10.800 --> 53:14.760
I mean, so they're fragile and they're important

53:14.760 --> 53:18.040
and yet they're hanging off the body in danger, basically.

53:18.040 --> 53:20.280
So does that make sense?

53:20.280 --> 53:22.000
You know, they begin in the womb,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.280
they begin inside the abdomen and they slowly descend

53:25.280 --> 53:27.720
and sometimes before birth, sometimes in the first year

53:27.720 --> 53:30.720
of life, sometimes never, they pop out of the body

53:30.720 --> 53:32.680
and end up hanging in the scrotum.

53:32.680 --> 53:35.040
There's a reason because the chemical reactions

53:35.040 --> 53:39.360
that create sperm function best at a few degrees cooler

53:39.400 --> 53:43.440
than body temperature and so that's why you might notice

53:43.440 --> 53:46.120
in the warm weather, they might hang further down

53:46.120 --> 53:48.800
and in the cold weather, they scrunch themselves up

53:48.800 --> 53:51.200
to get closer to the body to maintain

53:51.200 --> 53:53.520
that ideal temperature a few degrees cooler.

53:55.200 --> 53:56.960
So it's hard, you know, if you could create

53:56.960 --> 53:59.200
a sperm production mechanism that did not rely

53:59.200 --> 54:00.840
on that lower temperature, that'd be great.

54:00.840 --> 54:03.840
Keep them inside the body protected like the ovaries are.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.160
Oh, then you wouldn't rely on the lower temperature.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.800
I thought you meant create some kind of weird

54:09.800 --> 54:12.240
internal cooling mechanism.

54:12.240 --> 54:14.560
Well, I guess that would be one solution

54:14.560 --> 54:17.600
but just maybe a different type of chemical reaction

54:17.600 --> 54:19.680
or, you know, would not be reliant

54:19.680 --> 54:21.880
on the lower temperature, let's say.

54:21.880 --> 54:25.200
You know, it'd be great to design a sperm metagenesis

54:25.200 --> 54:28.480
or sperm production process that would function best

54:28.480 --> 54:30.480
at body temperature and then we can keep

54:30.480 --> 54:32.560
those delicate organs inside the body

54:32.560 --> 54:35.240
and not have them hanging out in danger.

54:35.240 --> 54:40.240
Or maybe the argument for this design is maybe it's nice

54:41.320 --> 54:44.560
to put them in danger so you are constantly concerned

54:44.560 --> 54:46.080
about it.

54:46.080 --> 54:49.080
Could be, maybe that's beneficial for male psychology.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.160
I'm not really sure.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.640
There's a psychological element here

54:51.640 --> 54:53.360
about the evolution that could be.

54:53.360 --> 54:54.880
So that's testicles.

54:56.520 --> 54:57.360
Penis?

54:58.800 --> 55:00.680
A better way to do it, you know?

55:00.680 --> 55:03.360
I mean, it's pretty good as it is, you know,

55:03.920 --> 55:07.400
when it's time for it to work, it grows and stiffens

55:07.400 --> 55:09.560
and when it's time for it not to work,

55:09.560 --> 55:11.840
it kind of shrinks and hangs out.

55:12.880 --> 55:17.240
Saw this on a Seinfeld episode, so I know how it works.

55:17.240 --> 55:18.160
Shrinkage.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.400
Yeah, that was a good one.

55:19.400 --> 55:23.640
But, you know, that's also a bit unique, I suppose,

55:23.640 --> 55:26.480
that the way it has this erectile tissue.

55:26.480 --> 55:28.520
Actually, they're similar.

55:28.520 --> 55:30.680
In the mouth of certain baleen whales,

55:30.720 --> 55:34.080
there's a certain similar kind of erectile tissue

55:34.080 --> 55:39.080
that helps cool them off because they have so much blubber

55:39.760 --> 55:42.640
and creates so much heat in moving around and feeding

55:42.640 --> 55:44.000
that they have actually a similar,

55:44.000 --> 55:45.680
similar to the penis organ in their mouth

55:45.680 --> 55:48.120
that helps cool their bodies because it's a big problem.

55:48.120 --> 55:51.000
They have to store all that blubber for fuel,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.120
but it makes them too hot, so as a compensation,

55:53.120 --> 55:55.280
they have this kind of erectile organ in their mouth.

55:55.280 --> 55:56.120
Okay.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.120
What about vagina?

55:59.160 --> 56:02.920
You know, the fact that miscarriages sometimes happen

56:02.920 --> 56:05.800
because of sexually transmitted diseases,

56:05.800 --> 56:08.080
because of trauma, you know, it would be great

56:08.080 --> 56:11.320
if the uterus where the growing fetus is

56:11.320 --> 56:14.000
is sort of even more protected from those things.

56:15.760 --> 56:18.680
You know, I guess that's a side effect of the fact

56:18.680 --> 56:20.800
that people still have sex when they're pregnant

56:20.800 --> 56:23.200
are still exposed to injury.

56:23.200 --> 56:26.240
If there was a way to make it more protected, perhaps,

56:26.240 --> 56:27.520
that would be even better.

56:27.520 --> 56:30.520
I did see an article recently about the artificial wombs,

56:30.520 --> 56:33.760
which are rapidly becoming a reality,

56:33.760 --> 56:36.560
and in animal studies, they're able to prolong

56:36.560 --> 56:40.800
the gestation of a fetus by a month in an artificial womb.

56:40.800 --> 56:42.760
Can you explain the artificial aspect

56:42.760 --> 56:43.720
of the artificial womb?

56:43.720 --> 56:44.560
Sure.

56:45.480 --> 56:49.120
I believe it acts almost like a heart-lung bypass machine,

56:49.120 --> 56:52.000
so when someone's getting bypass surgery,

56:52.000 --> 56:53.400
their heart is stopped.

56:53.400 --> 56:55.160
Literally, they throw ice in the chest,

56:55.160 --> 56:58.720
and they give a potassium infusion through the blood,

56:58.720 --> 57:00.040
which stops the heart,

57:01.040 --> 57:04.240
but the blood is run through a machine

57:04.240 --> 57:08.000
that basically does the work of the heart and lungs together.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.400
It gets oxygen into the blood

57:09.400 --> 57:11.800
and then pushes it back into the body.

57:11.800 --> 57:14.080
So I believe it's a sort of similar mechanism

57:14.080 --> 57:16.920
to keep blood and nutrition flowing to this fetus,

57:18.120 --> 57:20.880
and so it's just not inside the body of a parent,

57:20.880 --> 57:23.320
it's in some kind of other device,

57:23.320 --> 57:27.120
but I think that science is gonna rapidly improve.

57:27.120 --> 57:29.920
One benefit is babies are born premature,

57:29.920 --> 57:34.360
and while neonatology is able to continuously

57:34.360 --> 57:37.200
lower the age of viability through better technology

57:37.200 --> 57:40.680
and understanding what medicines and other things

57:40.680 --> 57:43.440
you can do to premature babies when they're born,

57:43.440 --> 57:46.200
ideally, if, let's say, premature labor begins,

57:46.200 --> 57:49.240
you can't stop it, that baby's coming out one way

57:49.240 --> 57:50.840
or the other, if you could just then stick it

57:50.840 --> 57:54.400
into an artificial womb where it can continue its development

57:54.400 --> 57:56.360
that would save a whole host of problems off,

57:56.360 --> 57:59.640
and those babies born very early suffer from damage

57:59.640 --> 58:01.640
to various organs, including the brain,

58:01.640 --> 58:02.560
for the rest of their life,

58:02.560 --> 58:05.000
so that could be a very important technology.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.760
So some aspects of the human body

58:07.760 --> 58:10.360
we can develop technologies that outsource them,

58:10.360 --> 58:15.360
sort of offload some of the stress

58:16.120 --> 58:19.800
and the workload from the human body to do it elsewhere.

58:19.800 --> 58:21.840
Like dialysis does that for kidneys.

58:21.840 --> 58:25.240
People can live decades without kidneys

58:25.240 --> 58:29.040
as long as they get dialysis, which does the work for them.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.480
Not every organ can do that.

58:30.480 --> 58:31.720
For instance, the liver,

58:31.720 --> 58:34.360
there's no dialysis version for the liver.

58:34.360 --> 58:36.960
If your liver fails, you need a liver transplant,

58:36.960 --> 58:39.560
and that's the only thing that's gonna do it for you.

58:40.640 --> 58:45.640
So that's the world's first artificial womb for humans,

58:45.640 --> 58:47.840
and we're looking at a picture

58:47.840 --> 58:50.320
of what looks like gigantic balloons.

58:50.320 --> 58:51.920
Matrix, here we come.

58:51.920 --> 58:53.760
This is very matrix-y.

58:53.760 --> 58:55.440
How are they floating?

58:55.440 --> 58:57.280
What are we even looking at?

58:57.280 --> 59:00.360
There's giant red spheres.

59:00.360 --> 59:02.440
This really looks like the matrix.

59:03.880 --> 59:04.760
I wonder where it's from,

59:04.760 --> 59:07.680
so there seems to be a paper on this, too.

59:07.680 --> 59:08.920
I don't know too much about it,

59:08.920 --> 59:12.800
but I did see that it's advancing very rapidly.

59:12.800 --> 59:15.000
The world's first artificial womb for humans.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.600
Scientists in the Netherlands say

59:17.600 --> 59:20.400
they're within 10 years of developing an artificial womb

59:20.400 --> 59:22.960
that could save the lives of premature babies.

59:22.960 --> 59:25.000
Premature birth before 37 weeks

59:25.000 --> 59:27.680
is globally the biggest cause of death among newborns,

59:27.680 --> 59:31.360
but the development also raises ethical questions

59:31.360 --> 59:36.280
about the future of baby-making and so on and so forth.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.240
Wow.

59:37.240 --> 59:40.440
We're going to be facing a lot of ethical questions

59:41.400 --> 59:45.840
as we start to mess with human biology.

59:45.840 --> 59:50.480
In an effort to help human biology,

59:50.480 --> 59:52.600
we might start to mess with it,

59:52.600 --> 59:54.560
and it's going to be very interesting

59:54.560 --> 59:59.320
as we take steps towards the matrix.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.880
All right.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.040
What about the neighbors?

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.600
Poop, feces.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:11.680
There seems to be a lot of interesting stories

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.400
in that particular output, as well.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.280
What to you is fascinating?

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.280
What to you maybe is misunderstood

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.160
or little known about poop?

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.120
Well, it's hilarious, for one thing, that we do it.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.160
Oh, okay.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.680
The word is great, as well.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.080
There's so many different words.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.640
I do, you know, when I'm talking to the parents

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.760
of pediatric patients, I use the word poop.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.640
I don't often when I'm talking to adult patients

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:49.640
try to choose a more mature word, but poop is amazing.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.000
I mean, I guess it's, you know, it's sort of the most,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.240
the dirtiest, the most vile,

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.920
the most hated aspect of our bodies.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.400
It's the grossest.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.280
We don't want to think about it, talk about it,

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.960
have it anywhere near our, you know,

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.320
food or in social interactions.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.560
With good reason, you know,

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.200
I mentioned gastrointestinal infections

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.720
are one of the most common infections

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.240
the human body suffers from.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.240
And, you know, what we call the way they spread

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.320
from person to person, grossly enough,

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.680
is referred to as the fecal-oral route,

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.840
which means a bit of someone's stool

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.480
is getting into your, you're swallowing it,

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.880
you know, through water supply.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.520
For instance, diarrhea is actually quite a brilliant

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.840
mechanism of these microbes, right?

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.720
If you, let's say you're in the intestine of one person,

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.880
your goal is to get into the intestines of another person.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.600
Brilliant to just trick their intestines

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.040
into secreting all this fluid into the intestines

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.800
to increase the volume of stool and its runniness

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.120
so that when they do poop, it gets into the water supply

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.400
and then everyone else kind of ends up

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.800
getting infected as well.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.400
Wow, that's brilliant.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.000
Just the same way like, you know,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.120
tuberculosis or coronavirus kind of infects your lungs

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.400
and makes you cough, and you send it out into the air

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.760
and it ends up in other people's lungs.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.160
And that's all evolution.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.560
Yeah, it's brilliant.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.560
So diarrhea is intelligent, is a big takeaway lesson.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.600
It's one of the most intelligent things we can do

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.640
as an entirety of an organism,

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.520
not just a particular cognitive organism,

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.920
but there's, you know, we're made up of bacteria and viruses

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.000
and there's a lot of visitors and so on.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.440
As the entirety of the system,

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.960
diarrhea is one of our better accomplishments.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.800
It's fascinating.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.480
Well, I wonder, why is poop funny?

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.000
I think a lot of that is socially constructed,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.400
just how it's sort of supposed to be hidden away

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.120
yet something we always do,

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.120
something, you know, we chuckle about as children.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.440
But even in healthcare, you know,

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.120
it becomes this big topic of conversation

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.360
because you end up talking about it constantly.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.360
Like in the ER, people come in,

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.080
they're complete strangers,

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.720
sometimes like a nice old lady who resembles my grandmother

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.600
and all of a sudden I have to ask her all about

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.000
what's happening in the bathroom.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.280
Like, is she straining?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.480
What color is it?

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.840
What, you know, what's the consistency?

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.320
Does it float on top of the water more than it should?

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.200
Is it hard to flush?

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.680
I mean, there's a million different questions you learn

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.400
as a medical student and you're like this poop detective

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.360
when people come in with issues.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.280
And so it's funny, I guess, you know,

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.040
in the exam room with the doctor-patient relationship,

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.400
there's sort of no barriers.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.680
You know, you talk about everything

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.880
and you're talking about the most intimate details

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:31.360
of a person's life,

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.240
even though you just met them a second ago.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.800
It's so different than normal social interactions.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.920
Yet there is this social aspect.

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.520
A lot of what I do is social.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.840
You know, it seems like doctors,

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.840
what they do is mostly scientific,

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.520
but actually it's just relating to another person

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.600
and you have to maintain, you know,

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.800
your professional demeanor

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.800
and this normal human level interaction,

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.760
even though you're talking about poop.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.400
And that's a skill, that's an art and a science.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.560
Actually, I want to linger on that

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.240
because I'm a fan of just diving into conversations

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:08.240
right away with strangers, just getting no small talk.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.040
And this is like the ultimate,

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.520
I don't know if it's the ultimate,

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.480
but it's one version of no small talk.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.200
You get right to the point.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.320
That's really powerful from a psychology perspective.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.520
You're a kind of therapist

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.280
or you have the power to be a therapist.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.760
I don't mean just about the medical condition of the body,

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.560
but the psychological.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.560
There's so much fear connected to this concern,

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.880
also self-doubt, insecurities,

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.320
even sort of existential thoughts about your mortality.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.880
All of those things are right there in the room.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.560
So I think one way doctors deal with that

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.000
is they kind of have this cold way about them.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:56.800
They almost have like dual mode.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.920
One is like, I'm going to be friendly on the surface

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.920
and cold about the brutal honesty of the biology.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.720
But I wonder if there's like a skillful middle ground,

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.640
this dangerous place where you can help people

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.320
deal with their psychological insecurities, concerns,

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.080
fears, all those kinds of things.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.200
Is that just really tough to do?

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.880
Yeah, it's a huge part of being a doctor

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.320
is dealing with the psychological aspects

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.320
of whatever's going on with a patient's body.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.960
I mean, in the ER, you deal with psychiatric emergencies

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.560
kind of left and right more than ever these days.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.920
And that's a huge issue, not to mention sort of drug use,

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.160
alcohol-related stuff, that gets into sort of psychology

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.360
and the human love of intoxicants

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.080
and changing the brain's chemistry.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.680
And habit, of course, we're creatures of habit

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.960
and that plays in as well.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.040
I mean, a big part of, for instance, pediatrics

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:59.040
is reassuring parents and kind of convincing them,

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.240
giving them the confidence that what's going on

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.920
with their child is not serious, will go away on its own,

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.480
does not need any particular intervention.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:11.480
And, but adults too, reassurance is a huge part of the game.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.600
Yeah, in the ER, you see humanity at its most raw.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.960
I feel like you get this tremendous insight into people,

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.440
how they live, what they worry about,

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.240
what they think about, how their body works,

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.480
and also how their mind works,

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.320
that you almost don't see anywhere else.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.120
It's a really interesting place to work.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.120
And also the way our society is shaped,

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.680
the ER is where people go for almost everything.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:37.920
When they're suicidal, they come to the ER.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.720
When they're too high on drugs to walk,

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.840
they come to the ER.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.960
Children who have been abused, sexually abused,

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.080
physically abused, come to the ER for us to investigate.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:48.560
It's sort of like the all-purpose waste bin

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.960
for the dregs of society,

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.480
what people do to themselves

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.480
and what they do to other people.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.640
You mentioned your interest in the darkness of humanity.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.960
It made me think of the ER,

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.960
where you really see what human life is like in the ER.

01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.480
Okay, you tweet about, you write about,

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.840
you think about the emergency room ER.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.120
That's really fascinating.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.200
Just the little window you give to that world is fascinating.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:19.160
What lessons about humanity do you draw

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.120
from this place where you're so near to death?

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.720
There's so much chaos.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.920
There's so much variety of what's wrong,

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.560
so little information,

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.720
or the urgent nature of the information inflows

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.960
such that you can't really reason

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.520
sort of thoroughly and deeply and collect all the data,

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.360
all those kinds of things.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:42.760
You have to act fast.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.280
You have to act fast.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.880
And then everybody's freaking out.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.040
Can you just speak to the human condition

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:55.000
that you get a glimpse at through the ER experience?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.400
Yeah, I think you do see all those things.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.320
I think on one end of the spectrum,

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.080
it is this very unique place

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.800
where you get all these unique insights.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.200
On the other end, it can become a ho-hum workplace,

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.640
just like any other, which is sort of surprising.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.480
As I mentioned before,

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.200
humans seem to be able to get used to almost anything,

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.520
and doctors can get ho-hum used to,

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.800
oh, dying of a heart attack,

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.320
oh, actively in labor and the baby's half out,

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:22.520
oh, just ho-hum, I know what to do,

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.880
going about my job and go home and have dinner

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.240
with my family and not think too much about it.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.520
That's amazing.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.160
I do try to maintain both my fascination.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.760
I think writers in general tend to think more

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.560
about what they see, write more about what they see,

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.600
maybe draw connections with what they see to other things.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.400
So I do think that writer's perspective

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.920
does help me kind of maintain my fascination

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.800
and my kind of more of an insightful perspective

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.840
than just a ho-hum, water cooler conversation.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.440
But you do see a lot.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.680
In a way, medical problems

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.200
are sort of the great equalizer, right?

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.200
Class, race, culture, background,

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.920
the failings of the human body, the way it fails

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.480
and what we can do to help in those situations

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.320
is almost universal.

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.880
I always liked this quote from,

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:14.160
Chekhov was a doctor and a writer

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.200
and he treated a lot of peasants, very low class,

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.840
and also treated a lot of aristocrats.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:24.240
And he wrote that they all have the same ugly bodies,

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.360
basically, which I think is really right on.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.920
And it's sort of, you can see people

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.320
underneath a superficial layer of clothing,

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.120
maybe it's the most expensive clothing

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.680
bought from the fanciest places,

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:38.440
but underneath their body is still failing in the same way

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.000
and they still have the same anxieties,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.920
the same worry about mortality,

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:45.520
the same concerns about why their poop turned green today,

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.360
all these things that they bring to the table.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.000
So in a way, it is this great equalizer

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.600
where people are kind of all the same in some ways.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.520
Yeah, I feel like people sometimes,

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:01.240
class, money, fame, power,

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:06.280
makes you for a time forget that you're just a meat vehicle

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.840
and just as good and just as bad

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:13.320
as the other meat vehicles all around you.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.240
In that sense, there's this question sometimes raised,

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.360
are some people better than others?

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.800
And I usually answer no to that question because of that.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.680
Yeah, some people might be better at math,

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.600
some people might be better at music,

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.800
but in the end, we're just meat bags.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.040
Beautiful as we are.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.880
There's a poem that just, a small tangent I wanna take,

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.880
I just saw it just acting that you have written.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.040
I have to, would you classify it as a poem?

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.000
Yeah.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.280
At first, if I may read it,

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.800
at first you enter the clinic,

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.600
shoulders weighed down by white coat pockets,

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.840
book stuffed, timid, you act out a role,

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.720
your white coat, a costume, your questions, a script,

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.440
your demeanor, a rehearsed act.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.600
No one is going to buy this,

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.960
but then as you play the role again and again,

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.360
repeating the lines and the motions,

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.040
the script slowly dissolves

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.960
and the interaction becomes thoughtless

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.400
and the rehearsed act slowly fades into a profession.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.040
You suddenly find yourself unable to tell

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.240
if you're still acting or if you're doing it for real.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.720
And now you're a doctor.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.280
Jonathan Reisman, MD, Harvard, Massachusetts General

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:40.080
Hospital Medicine and Pediatrics Department.

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:40.920
Beautiful.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.240
So that is what it is to be a doctor.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.520
You're just acting.

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.600
Fake it till you make it.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.200
Exactly, fake it till you make it.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.520
And I think, I imagine every medical student

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.120
has this feeling when they first go into a room.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.200
Like I talked about asking this nice old lady

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.480
about the color of her poop for the first time

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.360
and you're just like, what am I doing here?

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.960
Like does she believe I'm a doctor?

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.600
This just feels absurd.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.840
But then it's again, ho hum becomes normal.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.760
Now there's not a sperm chapter in your book.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.760
You mentioned offline that this is a second

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.680
and a third book that you're working on all about sperm.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.360
No, I'm just kidding.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.760
But, or maybe I'm not.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.920
Humor tends to make way for reality.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:32.600
So the tweet was that an average human male

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.120
produces 500 billion sperm I believe,

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.360
which is about four to five times more

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.840
than the number of people who have ever lived.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.720
And each of those sperm is genetically unique

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.680
so you can think of them, you can kind of imagine

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:51.040
the possible humans they could have created.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.160
And they're all different.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.600
They have similarities of course,

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.720
but they have peculiarities that make them different.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.520
And you can think of all the different trajectories,

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.600
all the Einsteins, the Finemans, the Hitlers,

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.200
and all the people who would have died during childbirth,

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.920
who would have died early in their years

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.280
given the different diseases.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.360
It's fascinating to think about an average human.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.080
Yeah, we're all winners of a very competitive race.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:23.920
So the people who make it, we're winners, hashtag winning.

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.920
Is there something that you find fascinating,

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.640
interesting, beautiful, ugly, surprising about sperm?

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.440
I think sperm is, yes, it is a very interesting

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.200
bodily fluid, maybe I'll write about it

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.840
in the second or third book, we'll see.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:49.000
But I guess sperm is interesting

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.480
because it's kind of the only projectile bodily fluid

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.560
from the body.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.040
Vomit can be projectile, usually that's a diseased state,

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.440
that's not the expected kind of normal healthy state.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:03.880
Oh, sneezing, would you classify that or no?

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.960
True, I guess it's, yeah, there's some particles in the air,

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.760
I guess it's not a fluid, I mean, not a liquid, but true.

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.880
I mean, cough in addition to sneeze, right?

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.240
Sneeze is how our nose gets rid of something

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:17.840
that shouldn't be there, cough is how our lungs

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.440
get rid of something that shouldn't be there.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.520
Vomiting is sometimes how our stomachs get rid of something

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.960
that shouldn't be there.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.440
All projectiles sometimes in their own way.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.280
Sperm is sort of interesting, it's created with the food

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.720
for its journey, sperm mostly feed off of fructose,

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.840
a kind of sugar, for the few days that they live

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.840
inside the female genital tract.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:38.160
But it's sort of, I like comparing our genitals

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.520
to the genitals of the plant world, which is flowers,

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.560
and in the same way that a touch me not, for instance,

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.680
the kind of flower where when you brush up against it,

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:48.920
it sort of launches seeds into the distance

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.600
to try to survive in a way, kind of the sperm

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.840
is doing something similar, launched into the female

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.960
genital tract and then all trying to find this,

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.600
competing against each other to find this egg.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.200
It's really amazing, and when you learn about it

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.120
from the biological perspective,

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.960
the most amazing thing is how many things can go wrong,

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.880
just in the sperm not surviving long enough

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.600
for it making it to the egg,

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.720
and then some genetic abnormality causing a miscarriage.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.280
It's sort of astounding that it works as often as it does,

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.720
and I think the lesson there is just that people

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.520
have a lot of sex, and so statistics just favor

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.280
it's gonna work out a good number of times.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.720
Yeah, and there might be intelligence in the design

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.920
of just the sheer number of sperm.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.960
Maybe that's yet another way to inject variety

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.640
into the system.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.320
And redundancy, I guess.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.680
We have two kidneys, we have two hands.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.560
If we lose one, we can still go on.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.960
We have however many millions of sperm get sort of launched

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.320
in every ejaculation, if a bunch fail,

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.400
or don't make it inside.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.240
There's papers on this, by the way,

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:58.400
that I read for some reason, not read,

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.360
but skimmed for some reason,

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.600
which is talking about which sperm usually wins.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.240
What are the characteristics of sperms that are winning,

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:09.320
and it's not the fastest?

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.440
So apparently there's some kind of slaughter

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:15.360
that happens early on, people will correct me,

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.280
but it's not the fastest.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.360
There is an aspect of it's the luckiest.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:21.800
It really is, like the body tries to make it

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.240
a random selection, it tries to make it fair

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.960
in making it as random as possible.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.120
Interesting, and also interesting that they're fueled

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.360
by fructose, I didn't really think about that.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:36.560
So they're a carb-loaded athlete.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:38.880
Right, with food for the journey.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.560
Food for the journey, because I'm somebody

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.920
that actually does a lot of running on,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.440
I guess you would call me a fat-adapted athlete,

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:51.240
so I do sort of meat-heavy diet,

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.920
and so you could do a lot of endurance kind of stuff

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.520
when you don't eat any carbs, any glucose,

01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.000
any of that kind of stuff, and you're very low.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.920
It's interesting to think that sperm are like,

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.000
nope, they're total bros, let's go to the gym,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
sprint, performance, short-term performance is everything.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:16.440
All right, well, that's sperm returning to the liver,

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.520
the place that deals with all our poor decisions.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.920
No.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.760
Many of them.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.160
Many of our poor decisions.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:29.160
Is there, you said that the liver does quite a few things.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.040
What to you is fascinating, beautiful about the liver?

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.960
I'd say its primary function seems to be

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.720
as the sort of gatekeeper for what we eat and absorb.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:44.560
The entire gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.640
to the rectum, the blood flows from it,

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.840
not back to the heart, but to the liver,

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:54.040
where it's first examined, kind of things are evaluated,

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:59.040
packaged, processed, detoxified, perhaps.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.200
It's kind of this great overseer

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.880
of what we digest and absorb,

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.680
and so it kind of keeps track of what's coming in,

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.640
you know, the outside world that comes in

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:11.840
and will become part of us.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:15.120
You know, that's why partly the liver suffers sometimes,

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:19.240
the injury from certain toxins like alcohol,

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.240
but beyond that, the liver is also the place, as I said,

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.680
it metabolizes things too, so it metabolizes alcohol

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.360
and why it can be injured by alcohol.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.320
It metabolizes drugs like Tylenol,

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.640
which is why Tylenol can be very toxic to the liver

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.040
when taken as an overdose.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.520
So the liver, you know, even beyond that,

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:42.080
the liver produces a lot of different, you know,

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.520
things that float in the bloodstream.

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.240
It packages cholesterol and fats

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.080
and sends them to where they're needed.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.080
It deals with protein in the blood.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.880
It deals with clotting factors in the blood,

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.960
helping the blood clot, you know,

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.320
processes things like bilirubin and other things

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.440
that really, as I mentioned,

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.440
is like 15 organs wrapped into one.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:02.840
Maybe that's why it's sort of the biggest internal organ.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.320
The skin's bigger, but it's not an internal organ.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:10.360
Right, the biggest organ in the human body is the skin.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.080
Right, but the liver is the biggest internal organ

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.000
and it really is a powerhouse and does a lot,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.640
which is why when people suffer from liver failure,

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.640
kind of everything goes wrong in a way.

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.040
And in terms of replacing organs,

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:28.360
what are organs that are easily replaceable,

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.880
which are not?

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.800
Like on the list of things that are hard to replace

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.800
and what would you put in number one?

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.200
What would you put like at the bottom?

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.600
Well, I'd say the kidneys are, you know, nothing's easy,

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.840
but kidneys are easiest in a way.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.040
Partly, I mean, maybe a big factor there

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.520
is that other people have two of them

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.480
and can give one to you.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.960
So you don't have to wait for people to die,

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.000
which is the case with hearts and livers.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Sometimes you can take a part of a liver

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.440
from someone who's alive.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.080
And the liver does have this kind of mythological ability

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.240
to regenerate itself.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:03.080
In the myth of Prometheus, he's chained to a rock

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.880
and the bird eats his liver every day

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.880
and it grows back every day.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.160
And that's actually biologically accurate.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.760
Not that you can completely get rid of it

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.640
and it'll appear again,

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.120
but when pieces of it are removed or injured,

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:17.280
it does regenerate itself pretty amazingly.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.960
So I'd say the kidneys, the fact that there are more around.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.200
Also it's, you know, the kidney is a smaller organ.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.280
It's often just, you don't have to put a transplanted kidney

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.320
where the kidney should be in the back of the abdomen.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.640
You can just kind of stuff it into the pelvis there

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.720
because it's a smaller organ.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.880
The liver would be hard because it's huge.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.080
And I guess we just have the most experience

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.880
with kidney transplants because they are the most common.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:46.400
And the heart and the brain are probably quite difficult.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.480
Brain, as far as I know, hasn't been successfully done.

01:20:49.480 --> 01:20:51.040
The heart is done.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.320
And definitely I've evaluated a lot of patients

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.880
with a heart transplant.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.200
It does work pretty well.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.520
The mechanical heart substitutes

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.640
are also advancing quite rapidly these days.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:06.240
For a failing heart, there's certain kinds of devices

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.320
they can surgically implant.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.960
Like when a failing heart isn't able to push hard enough,

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.120
you know, that's the heart's job is pushing blood

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:15.600
with sufficient pressure to create blood pressure.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.800
When it fails, there are actually these devices

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.520
you can strap onto the heart to help it pump harder.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.160
Those are rapidly advancing.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.320
Many of those were not available even 10 years ago

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.280
when I got out of med school and now they're commonly used.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.200
So maybe heart transplant won't be as necessary

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.480
in the future if those mechanical things do advance.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.160
And as I said, the heart is basically a mechanical pump.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:39.200
So perhaps it would be the easiest organ

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.880
to replace with some mechanical device.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.560
Now for something completely different,

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.040
returning to testicles for a time.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:50.040
You posted an Instagram post of testicles as food.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.240
Perhaps eating them doesn't help libido

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:58.200
because ingested testosterone is totally metabolized

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:01.160
in the liver, returning to our liver,

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.440
leaving none to reach the bloodstream.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.440
That is why testosterone only comes as injection

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.360
or topical foam, not as pills.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.200
On the other hand, estrogen and progesterone

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.360
can be absorbed orally, hence the pill.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.760
But testosterone is mostly responsible

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.400
for libido in women too.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.640
I was not expecting for this biology lesson

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:28.440
when I was looking at an Instagram picture of,

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.040
are we looking at testicles?

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:30.880
Yeah.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:34.200
Are these, like, which species?

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.400
I believe all those are from cows.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.720
From cows, cow testicles.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.920
Cows are technically females, so bulls.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.080
Yeah, well, speaking of which,

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.800
just we'll jump around a bit,

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:47.760
but you've also traveled the world quite a bit.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.520
What have you,

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.280
what is the craziest food you've eaten across the world?

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.800
What have you learned about the extremes

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.800
of the culinary arts by traveling the world?

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:07.720
I would say, I guess I've always been extra fascinated

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:11.600
with the diets of natives of the far north.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.320
I spent some time there in Russia and in Alaska

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:18.480
and always loved their diet.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.560
So when I was, I worked in Alaska in an emergency room

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.080
and did some other travels in the, in Arctic Alaska.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.800
And, you know, they eat a lot of fat.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:29.960
Traditionally, before contact, you know,

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.480
more than half of all calories

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.080
in the Inupia Eskimo diet came from blubber,

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.920
marine mammal fat, or, you know, also fat from fish,

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.880
fat from ducks and other birds

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.680
that go up there to mate in the summer.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.320
So things like raw whale blubber was especially interesting

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.160
for me and very exciting.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.600
You know, I had some beluga whale chowder,

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.440
things like that.

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:55.920
There's just all these very unusual dishes.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.760
You know, there's a dish called mickey yuck,

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:03.360
which is whale meat fermented in whale blood,

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.040
which is quite delicious actually.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.840
So is it cooked, is it eaten raw?

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.560
Is it, how do they like their fat?

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:13.800
Like in, and the same in up north in Russia,

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.760
as you mentioned.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:16.760
So they often eat it raw.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:19.200
So the raw whale blubber is called muck duck,

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.040
and it's often just sliced thin.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.520
And it's sort of cold, but not frozen,

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.840
when often when they eat it, and they slice it thin.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.120
And a lot of people assume it would be very chewy,

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.360
but it's not that chewy.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.480
It's quite pleasant actually,

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.280
and has this kind of sea smell to it as you're eating it.

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.160
I quite like it.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.320
And what's the culinary culture like?

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.680
Meaning, is it just source of energy or is it art?

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:47.520
Well, there's, you know, traditionally,

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.600
there's not a lot of cooking in, you know, in the Arctic.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.160
A lot of things are eaten raw,

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.720
partly because there's not a lot of fuel for making fires.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.040
So they will, you know, some in some of the big rivers

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.960
in Russia, for instance, that flow north,

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.140
they will bring trees, you know, dead trees and logs

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:07.700
up to the north, and they can get some wood that way.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.580
And same thing in some of the rivers,

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:12.860
kind of flowing northward from the Brooks Range of Alaska.

01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:14.780
You do get some trees, but just not enough

01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:18.220
to really produce a culinary art

01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:20.740
that requires cooking with heat.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:23.980
You know, they do have traditionally blubber lamps

01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:26.340
where the blubbers of seals and whales are used

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:28.260
to create a little flame.

01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:32.300
Often that's for light and for a little bit of heat,

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.580
and less for cooking.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:37.220
But eating things raw is definitely a huge part

01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:38.060
of the culture there.

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:40.220
And while I was, I went on a whale hunting trip

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:44.700
out on the spring ice in the Arctic Ocean by Barrow, Alaska.

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:48.840
And two of the guys, the Inupiat guys who had invited me

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.480
were kind of talking about how eating things raw

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.460
is sort of the most essential characteristic

01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.880
of Inupiat culture.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.940
And the one guy who's half white, half Inupiat

01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:59.160
said people often doubt his ethnicity

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.680
because he looks like a white guy.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:04.340
So he'll, you know, bite the head off of a raw bird

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.340
to show them that he is truly Inupiat, is what he said.

01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.120
That's how you prove you're legit.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.100
We're looking at an Instagram pic.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:14.100
As a doctor, I was used to knowing fat

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.140
as the most maligned of all body parts,

01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:19.560
and the culprit in an obesity epidemic.

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:23.540
But in Arctic Alaska, fat has always meant health

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:24.780
and survival.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.300
In fact, the entire story of life in the Arctic,

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:30.740
especially human life, is basically a tale of fat.

01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.620
And in Barrow, what's A-K?

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:34.460
Alaska.

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:35.380
Alaska, okay.

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.180
A lawn covered with a whale blubber

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:42.460
is still equivalent of a plush green lawn

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:43.740
in temperature suburbia,

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:46.980
swelling in its owner with pride.

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.140
And that's what we're looking at

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.760
is a lawn full of whale blubber.

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:54.380
A beautifulness.

01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.820
So this is, I mean, there's a lot of calories there.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:57.660
Oh yeah.

01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:58.860
And this can feed a lot of people.

01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.220
A lot of energy, a lot of warmth.

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.300
Absolutely, and it's delicious.

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:06.980
And this was like, I was a kid in a candy store, basically.

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.500
I rounded a corner in Barrow.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.140
So when people do get a whale

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:12.140
during the spring whaling season,

01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:14.060
they raise a flag or the whaling captain

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:15.540
raises a flag over his house

01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:18.700
and everyone in town is welcome to come try some.

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:21.660
And so before I went inside to try some,

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:24.020
I was kind of playing around with blubber

01:27:24.020 --> 01:27:26.340
and I saw the, this is a bowhead whale.

01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:29.300
I saw its heart, which was huge,

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.580
like the size of a yoga ball.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.820
And that was for me just like amazing.

01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.580
I spent probably the next 45 minutes

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:37.100
just looking at all aspects of it

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.660
and the stump of aorta that was attached to it

01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.920
was the size of my thigh.

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.700
That was really fascinating.

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.100
It's similar Alaska and Northern Russia

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.200
like Siberian out there.

01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.500
So where were you?

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.000
I think you have some picks from that time.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.580
Where were you in Russia?

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.500
So I spent a lot of time in kind of Western Russia as well,

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:02.180
but I did take two trips to Kamchatka,

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:04.420
including Northern Kamchatka.

01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:06.660
I didn't go far enough nor,

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:08.340
I didn't go to Chukotka for instance,

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.200
until more recently when I was a ship doctor

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.660
on a wildlife cruise that sailed from Anadyr, Russia

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.940
up to through the Bering Strait into Wrangel Island.

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.460
And we stopped in some villages in Chukotka

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:25.260
and I got a chance to try some whale and stuff like that.

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.780
Northern Kamchatka where it's more the Coriac

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:29.280
are the indigenous people.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.500
They do a lot of seal hunting.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.660
So I had a lot of seal blubber,

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:35.580
but I don't believe they do any whale hunting quite there.

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:38.580
But the Chukchi in a way are sort of similar

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.360
to the Inupiat in their diet and their life ways.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.580
Of course, everyone's diet,

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.700
all these people's diet has changed dramatically

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.700
in the last hundred years as it has

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:50.800
for actually everyone living in kind of modern societies.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.620
But for them, perhaps more than anyone else

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:54.700
since their diet was the most extreme,

01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:57.560
I think of any human culture on earth.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:01.120
Just to stay on the wild travel you did.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.480
And I should say, I'm using the word travel,

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.980
but it really, you were a doctor there.

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.120
First of all, can you just comment on the decision

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:18.120
to go to such places and to help people to be a doctor there?

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:19.520
What was the motivation?

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.020
What was the thinking behind it?

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.680
Well, I think I got the travel bug

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.160
before I ever went to medical school

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.820
and even wanted to be a doctor.

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:31.300
So right after college, I kind of wasn't very into college,

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:33.980
didn't enjoy things, kind of wanted to get out there

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:36.580
and see the world, get out of New York City

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.800
where I was a student at NYU.

01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:42.200
The first thing I did after finishing college

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.580
was I was invited to be an intern at a research center

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.340
in St. Petersburg, Russia.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:49.220
I spent six months there on my first trip

01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:52.600
and went back four more times to Russia,

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.860
traveled all over, including to Kamchatka twice

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.640
and other parts of the country I'd never heard of,

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:02.740
cities like Petrozavodsk and Siktyvkar and Pskov.

01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.740
I didn't even know a word could start with P-S-K,

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:07.700
like the city of Pskov, but it can.

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.960
And I was sort of fascinated.

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.940
I was actually studying

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.980
the international environmental movement

01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:18.540
and how it came to Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:20.340
and how organizations like Greenpeace

01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:23.220
and World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:27.180
are trying to kind of push the timber industry,

01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:29.940
which is huge in Russia, toward a more sustainable path.

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:31.620
And so I was sort of evaluating

01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.300
how is it working, if not, why not?

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:36.360
And that seems like such a little niche,

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.900
such a small detail about Russian society,

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:41.640
but in a way researching that in depth

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.720
was almost this window into the entire country

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:46.980
and the history in a place I knew nothing about.

01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.800
And I learned the language, traveled all over the country,

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:53.060
got to know the food, the history, the literature,

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.340
it was just an immersive and amazing

01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:57.660
and life-changing experience that made me

01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:01.060
want to see every spot on the globe, basically,

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.100
and learn about every culture.

01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:06.260
So I took that desire with me to medical school.

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:08.380
I decided I would go to medical school.

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.120
And from the very beginning,

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:13.300
I was intent on traveling around the world.

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.180
So a lot of my career has been fashioned

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:18.360
so that I'm practicing medicine in a place

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.500
with an interesting geographic context,

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:24.380
an interesting place with an interesting cultural context.

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:27.520
And that just makes it more interesting, I find.

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.960
Not only are medical services often more needed

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.800
in these remote and rural parts of the country and world.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.540
So I feel like I'm taking my knowledge

01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:38.580
and education experience to places where it's needed.

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:41.940
But also for me, it's just such an enlightening experience.

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:44.940
The way culture, history, geography, climate

01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:47.880
affects medical disease, but just getting to know people,

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.480
getting to know their culture, being a very useful traveler

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.760
by providing medical services in that place.

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.320
And that's taken me to Arctic Alaska,

01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.440
to Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.400
I currently work in a few different parts

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.200
of Pennsylvania, Appalachia, which for me

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:06.840
is a unique geography and culture

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:09.000
that I didn't grow up with, wasn't familiar with.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.440
So in some ways, it's exotic for me as well.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.600
And I worked in other places, too, like Calcutta, India,

01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.000
Nepal.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.600
I think my love of travel has shaped my medical career.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.480
And being a doctor does give you these opportunities

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:27.080
to go to places and travel in a unique way

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:30.480
through the medical profession.

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.400
There's a documentary, Happy People,

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.760
Here in the Taiga or something like that.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:39.600
I think Warner Herzog voices it.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:43.880
It tells the story of a simple life of survival in the Taiga.

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.200
And I think they're trapping for food.

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.760
And there's an alcoholism problem, too, as well.

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:56.760
There's a very basic life of survival,

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.560
of loneliness, of desperation.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.240
But also there's a, I think the underlying claim

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:09.960
of the documentary is that that simple life

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:14.840
actually has a kind of simple happiness to it.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.520
Hence the name Happy People.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.160
Is there, can you speak to the life

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:27.160
that people live in those places when it may be simpler

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:31.280
than you would in sort of big city life?

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.440
It's definitely very different, for sure.

01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:39.920
I guess I found, like in some of the remote villages

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:43.880
of Kamchatka, I was actually surprised how similar

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:48.880
they were in that I saw the same family strife,

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.320
the same fights, the same kind of pairing

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:58.120
of relationships and bickering and politics.

01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:01.040
In a way, I'm from the New Jersey suburbs,

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.720
and yet being in this remote village of northern Kamchatka,

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.680
I remember writing an email to my friend about how

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.080
just it seemed so similar, even though on the surface

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.600
it was this exotic other world,

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.560
the incredible material know-how they must have

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.680
to get their food from the land.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.800
The number of animal species, plant species,

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:23.880
the behaviors of the animals, seasons,

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.280
how to live that way.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.040
In a way, it's more complicated in a way

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.680
that I find fascinating, how people live on the land

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.440
and the knowledge and experience it takes

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.720
to do it well and survive.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:36.400
Obviously, other aspects of modern life in a city

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:40.040
are much more complicated than they would be there,

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.440
but I guess that was something that struck me too,

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.760
that it's simpler in some ways,

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:45.840
but more complicated in other ways.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.520
So some of the complexity that happens in life

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.080
is originated from humans, not from the technology

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.320
or all that kind of stuff around us.

01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:57.240
You can take the human out of modernity,

01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.400
but they're still human.

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:01.120
They're still human, and they fill the empty space

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:03.400
with their own human complexities.

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:08.400
Are there people that just stand out, memorable people,

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.560
memorable experiences from those places?

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:18.800
Some people that maybe made you smile, made you cry,

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.560
changed who you are as a man,

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.640
changed who you are as a doctor.

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.160
Anything jumps to mind?

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.240
I think when I was, it was interesting,

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.880
when I was in Russia, I found that most of the people

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.840
I hung out with were old women.

01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.920
I'm not sure why.

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.080
Actually, I didn't meet a lot of old men in Russia,

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:39.560
which might speak to kind of life expectancy there

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:43.600
for men in particular, but I found women,

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.040
older Russian women, including Russian from St. Petersburg

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:49.880
or some of the elderly women in Kamchatka

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.000
who were, some were Koryak, some were half Koryak,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.360
half Russian, some were Chukchi.

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.120
I just found them to be so enlightening

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:02.040
the way they talked about history, about people,

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.840
so insightful about humanity, all they've lived through

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.960
in the last 50 years in some of these parts of Russia,

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.640
like the upheaval, societal upheaval, the destruction,

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.920
the building up, it's just something

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:15.880
I could not even imagine.

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.520
And I think their insights were just very,

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.960
I'm not thinking of anything in particular,

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:22.240
but I just remember I could listen to some

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.180
of these elderly women talk about their lives

01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:25.440
for hours and hours.

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:30.000
I remember there was this elderly blind Koryak woman

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.280
who you would have thought was the most country bumpkin

01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:35.400
of country bumpkin, and yet she couldn't stop talking

01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.400
about how much she loved reading Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.680
which might also speak to the Soviet education system.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.860
And it was just sort of surprising and fascinating,

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:46.920
and just those stories and perspectives on life

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.760
really stayed with me.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:53.760
Yeah, with Babushki, there's a wisdom, there's a kindness,

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.080
I mean, I suppose that's true for older people in general,

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.480
but there's something about, it's not just Russia,

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:14.480
it's Eastern Europe, it's like this kind of look of wisdom

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.360
and not just like sort of middle-class wisdom

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:23.760
or something like that.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.500
It's like, I have seen some shit wisdom.

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:31.860
I've seen it all, and on the other side,

01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:36.860
I'm left here with a pragmatism and a compassion,

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:39.700
and also an ability to cook really well.

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:41.540
That's for sure, absolutely.

01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:44.920
There's just this balance of just deep intelligence

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:49.920
and deep kindness, and yeah, I mean, much of who I am

01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:53.100
is because of the relationship I had with my grandmother,

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:58.100
who is a Russian, Ukrainian-born Russian grandmother.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.860
Did you learn the Russian language?

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:05.920
I did, it's quite rusty at this point,

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:10.180
but I did, one of these wonderful elderly Russians

01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:12.620
in St. Petersburg sort of adopted me.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.220
I think that was another thing that a lot of these

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:18.220
elderly women on every side of the country

01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:21.780
kind of adopted me or saw me as this real curiosity.

01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.940
Sort of just not, I mean, this was around 2002, 2003.

01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:28.580
It just wasn't common for this sort of strange American

01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:30.500
to suddenly show up in the middle of Kamchatka

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:33.720
or even St. Petersburg, and just absolutely

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.500
ravenously curious about everything they had to say,

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:40.220
so I often got adopted, and one of them taught me Russian

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:44.860
and how to ride a horse, so the same Babushka

01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:46.620
taught me both of those things.

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:49.220
And like you said also, I should mention that there's

01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:51.180
something about the Soviet education system

01:38:51.420 --> 01:38:54.700
where, yeah, everybody reads Tolstoy, Dostoevsky.

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.820
It's exceptionally well-read, no matter where life

01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:00.300
has taken you, no matter where you come from,

01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:02.900
the literature, the mathematics, the sciences,

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:06.500
they're all extremely well-educated,

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:09.500
and that creates a fascinating populace.

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:18.060
Then you take that education, that excellent early education,

01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:22.100
and you throw a bunch of hardship at those people,

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:26.420
and then they kind of cook in that hardship

01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:29.220
and come out really fascinating people on the other end.

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:32.620
It makes me surprised sort of that, for instance,

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:35.220
like Russian medical science is not,

01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:38.900
you don't see a lot of sort of studies,

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.140
medical studies, advancing of medical science

01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:43.500
come out of Russia, which is sort of,

01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:45.940
I'm surprised sort of, I wish that it would.

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:49.420
I visited Akadem Gorodok outside Novosibirsk,

01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:51.340
which is an entire city the Soviets created

01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.300
just for the study of science, and it's like,

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.500
there's the geology building, and there's the biology

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.460
building, and there's the chemistry building,

01:39:57.460 --> 01:40:00.340
and I just feel like Russia has this potential

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:03.140
to be a science powerhouse, or even in the medical sciences,

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.660
but I guess you just, I don't see it.

01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:07.660
I'm not sure why.

01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:10.580
I mean, you can certainly guess as to why,

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:14.460
and I see the same thing in the other, in the sciences.

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.860
I hold the dearest sort of in computer science,

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:19.660
in engineering fields.

01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:25.100
I kind of long held this desire by long,

01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:28.140
I mean, last couple years, because a bunch of people

01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:31.820
reached out to me from Yandex and Moscow State

01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:34.660
to give lectures there, to sort of connect, you know,

01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:37.740
why so little science is coming out of there?

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:41.540
Why so little that we hear about?

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.100
And it feels like we should be able to bridge

01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:44.820
the scientific community.

01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.820
Like, science, let's even say, even in turmoil

01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:53.660
of geopolitics, even in global conflict,

01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:56.700
I feel like science should be bigger than that.

01:40:56.700 --> 01:41:00.420
But why do we not hear from the scientists

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:03.460
is because of the limitations on human freedoms,

01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:05.060
on scientific freedoms.

01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:10.060
I feel like in China, in Russia, in any regime of its sort,

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:17.820
you should give freedom to scientists to flourish

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.220
and to interact with others,

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:20.900
and you can only grow from that.

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.300
You shouldn't suppress that.

01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:27.420
The sort of Cold War ideas, we should put those aside.

01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:31.180
As somebody who spent time in Russia,

01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:34.140
as somebody who learned Russian,

01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:38.640
do you have some thoughts that you want to say

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.420
about the war in Ukraine currently?

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:45.020
It's tragic, of course, seemingly pointless

01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:47.820
to watch the destruction of a country in real time.

01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:52.820
I guess it's, you know, when you read Russian history

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:54.820
and Ukrainian history, I guess it just,

01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:58.860
it's sort of, you know, destruction is a big part of it.

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:01.780
The populace being beaten down is a big part of it,

01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:04.620
you know, from the Mongolian hordes,

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:08.060
through the Tsar and the Soviets and Putin,

01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:12.220
I guess, you know, it's just, in science,

01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.460
in particular, medical science,

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.820
it feels like this sort of unrealized potential,

01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:18.060
you know, the culture is so beautiful,

01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.540
the people are so smart and well-educated.

01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:23.020
I think the word unrealized potential

01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:24.340
is kind of how I feel.

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:27.500
That's why I wanted to celebrate that part of the world,

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.300
is there's so many beautiful people,

01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:30.980
so many brilliant people.

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.580
And I just happen to know the language,

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:36.420
so I'm able to appreciate the beauty of those people.

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.700
I'm sure the same is true in China.

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.820
I'm sure that that's one of the things that makes me sad

01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:44.740
is there's all these cultures that I don't know about,

01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.420
I can't fully appreciate their brilliance.

01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:50.660
Even Japan and places like that that are sort of,

01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:52.980
there's channels of communication wide open

01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:54.300
and there's a lot of interaction,

01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:56.340
it's still not knowing the language,

01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:58.660
I feel like I miss some of the culture.

01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:01.940
Or Portuguese and, you know, looking at South America

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:03.300
and all that kind of stuff.

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:06.700
But anyway, in Russia, there certainly is

01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:08.180
that unrealized potential.

01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:12.420
In Ukraine, so many brilliant scientists, engineers,

01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:14.300
came from Ukraine, from Russia,

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:18.300
and I hope they get to flourish soon.

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:20.020
And I hope we put this,

01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.540
I hope we stop this war, because all war is hell.

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:32.420
Is there something to comment about the biology of war?

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:39.140
Is there echoes of the emergency room experience?

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:46.340
Have you dealt with patients

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.620
that have been touched by wartime?

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:53.260
Definitely, war and medicine has a very intricate

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:54.980
and complex relationship.

01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:57.180
I don't know if it was Walt Whitman who said it,

01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.580
though he was a nurse during the Civil War,

01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:01.540
that war is the best medical school,

01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.860
but some people have said that.

01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:07.380
And, you know, even advancements in medicine

01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:11.020
come from war, you know, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:14.220
have, in some ways, really revolutionized certain aspects

01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:15.980
of the way we treat trauma patients

01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:17.660
in the civilian world as well.

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:20.100
The importance of tourniquets,

01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:22.180
the importance of transusing whole blood

01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:24.660
instead of red blood cells isolated

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:27.060
from serum and platelets, et cetera.

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:29.260
The importance of pain control in the battlefield,

01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:30.540
that's changed dramatically,

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.340
everything from ketamine injections

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:35.620
to fentanyl lollipops in the battlefield.

01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:39.140
So war has really improved medicine in many ways.

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:42.700
In another way, you know, the Department of Defense

01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:44.540
spends a lot of money on medical research

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:46.620
and kind of really pushes the envelope.

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:50.140
You know, DARPA is one aspect of the military budget

01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:52.820
that really funds these moonshot experiments

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:54.260
that are really fascinating

01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.780
and to really push the frontiers

01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:59.740
more than seemingly most, you know,

01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:01.620
kind of universities doing it,

01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:04.300
doctors and researchers doing their research.

01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:06.900
So in a way, you know, the space program,

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:08.540
which sort of was military initially

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.460
then became civilian under NASA,

01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:13.660
also led to a lot of advances and understandings

01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:16.860
of health, you know, on earth and in space.

01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:19.700
So the military is, or war in general,

01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:23.100
is a huge way that medicine advances,

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.620
not to mention the epidemics that come, you know.

01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.500
My grandmother was from what's today Moldova,

01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:29.740
what was then Romania.

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:33.300
She got typhus during World War II.

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.540
So there's typhus outbreaks, there's cholera outbreaks,

01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:38.980
you know, all these, even infectious disease things

01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:40.980
can advance in war, which you wouldn't expect.

01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:43.700
You expect sort of trauma to be the sort of main problem,

01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.940
but actually infection is a huge problem

01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:47.020
throughout history in war.

01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:48.700
So we can learn a lot.

01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:51.420
It's this kind of horrific natural experiment

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:53.780
in medical care.

01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:56.420
Yeah, and I've recently been reading about

01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:59.260
some of the horrific medical experiments

01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:03.700
performed by Nazi scientists, Nazi Germany.

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:05.820
I'll talk about it another time, perhaps,

01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:10.820
but nothing reveals the honesty of human biology like war.

01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:15.020
Just to stay on your wild journeys

01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:16.300
for a little bit longer,

01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:19.980
you have a tweet about Shackleton saying,

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:22.460
here's a photo of Shackleton's medical kit

01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:26.380
from his storied expedition to Antarctica in the 1910s.

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:29.940
Some paragoric for pain, some laxative.

01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:33.940
Only the essentials.

01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:37.020
Would you put laxative under the essentials?

01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:38.340
Anyway, sorry to interrupt.

01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:44.100
When I worked as a ship doctor in Antarctica in 2018,

01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:48.660
I had a huge cabinet full of meds and even EKG machine.

01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:52.980
So if you can comment sort of on that contrast,

01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:55.660
first of all, your own journey, how harsh was it?

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.260
How difficult was it?

01:46:57.260 --> 01:47:00.900
And given that context,

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:04.180
can you think about how hard Shackleton's journey was?

01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.740
I think the difference is unimaginably stark.

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.620
One thing I do want to point out is that

01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:13.180
the use of laxatives early in the 20th century

01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:16.780
and before that, they were used for a surprising

01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:21.060
number of ailments where they probably did not help at all.

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:23.020
But I think that was a holdover

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:24.980
from sort of the old theory of medicine,

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:28.100
the humoral theory where you have to balance the fluids

01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.460
in the body and so causing people to vomit,

01:47:30.460 --> 01:47:31.820
causing them to have diarrhea

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:36.020
or purposely taking blood out of them in bloodletting

01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:36.860
was a big part.

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:38.900
And I think that crazy use of laxatives

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.780
was maybe a holdover from that time.

01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:43.580
But that being said,

01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:46.180
they were probably not eating very high fiber food

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:47.180
on that expedition,

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.820
so perhaps laxatives could have been helpful.

01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:51.140
There's a lot of seal,

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:54.380
penguin and seal meat being eaten,

01:47:54.380 --> 01:47:56.860
which is not super high in fiber.

01:47:56.860 --> 01:47:58.620
So I don't want to discount the importance

01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.380
of laxatives in that setting.

01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:02.140
But that wouldn't be the essential thing

01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:05.020
if you're thinking of a tiny kit

01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:07.020
that has only the essentials.

01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:11.660
I mean, pain, yes, laxatives, maybe not.

01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:13.740
I think the medical kit possibilities

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:16.300
were much narrower back then.

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:18.580
This was before antibiotics,

01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:22.540
before I think germ theory might have been,

01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:25.420
it was known, but there wasn't much to do about it.

01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:27.620
So the availability of medicines,

01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:29.060
I mean, that's something that exploded

01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.420
over the course of the 20th century.

01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:33.220
So what I can put in a backpack today

01:48:33.220 --> 01:48:34.700
filled with modern medications,

01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:36.660
whether injectable or to be taken orally

01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:39.980
is just many orders magnitude greater

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:41.460
than what they had back then.

01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:46.460
So when I went, my expedition was nothing like Shackleton's.

01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:51.460
I was on a huge cruise ship with 160 Japanese passengers

01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:53.700
who came with their own translators.

01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:58.220
And as I said, I had cabinets, not just one cabinet,

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:00.460
many cabinets full of medications,

01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:04.740
both injectable, some patches, some pills.

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:08.620
I was very impressed actually with what was available there.

01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:11.100
And I didn't have to use a lot of it, thankfully,

01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:12.980
though I did use some of it for people.

01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:18.860
But, and I slept and I got free room and board on the ship.

01:49:19.060 --> 01:49:23.300
So every Southern summer cruise ships go take people

01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:25.740
to Antarctica, the Southern Atlantic islands,

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:29.180
like the Falklands and other parts of the South Pacific.

01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:30.540
And then in the Northern summer,

01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:34.140
the same kind of cruise ship explosion happens,

01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:36.380
going to Greenland and Iceland and Svalbard

01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:40.340
and Franz Josef Land and other parts of the North Alaska.

01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:42.860
And every ship needs a doctor.

01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:44.780
So it's a great opportunity.

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:48.660
They want specifically ER doctors to deal with emergencies.

01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:51.860
But you're really working in the middle of nowhere

01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:54.940
and all you have is the medications there on the ship

01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:57.540
and supplies and your knowledge and experience.

01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:59.780
And so it's a very different experience

01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:01.980
than working in a high-tech modern hospital

01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:03.300
with every bit of technology

01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:06.500
and every subspecialist consultant available.

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.100
But I sort of like that challenge.

01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.700
I mean, I like going to the ends of the earth.

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:12.900
It's beautiful, it's exciting, it's fascinating.

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:15.780
Practicing medicine in those settings is extra challenging

01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:18.700
and really makes you hone some of your skills,

01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.300
which is part of the reason that I sought them out.

01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:25.140
Do you see echoes of some of that same effort?

01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:27.380
I've gotten a chance to interact with astronauts

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:30.740
and those kinds of folks working on space missions.

01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:33.180
Do you see some of those same echoes

01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:36.020
of challenging efforts going out into space

01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:38.620
and maybe landing on Mars and maybe beginning

01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:42.180
to build a small colony on Mars?

01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:44.500
Yeah, I think the healthcare that is needed

01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.020
will be a big part of that.

01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:47.900
Obviously, we're probably gonna send

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:49.940
overall quite healthy people.

01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:51.580
But there's a lot of medical decisions to make

01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:54.540
about what should be brought, what should be expected.

01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:57.220
To some extent, I've had a lot of doctors say,

01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:58.620
oh my goodness, I can't believe you work

01:50:58.620 --> 01:50:59.460
in the middle of nowhere.

01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:02.460
What do you do if someone gets a brain bleed,

01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:04.380
falls, hits their head, needs a neurosurgeon?

01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:06.540
I mean, the obvious answer is they die.

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.500
Things, when you're in the middle of Antarctica,

01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:11.300
things kill you that wouldn't

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:13.580
if you're inside a university hospital

01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:15.340
that's fully equipped to help with every problem

01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:16.820
that arises.

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:20.340
Mars takes that to a crazy extreme, obviously.

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:22.100
I know that even going to Antarctica,

01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:24.300
different countries have had different strategies.

01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:28.340
I believe Australia used to kind of just,

01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:31.740
in anticipation, remove people's gallbladders

01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:33.540
just so that it wouldn't get inflamed

01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:36.020
because that is a very common medical emergency.

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.940
So they would just remove it beforehand,

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.740
even though it was not diseased at all,

01:51:39.740 --> 01:51:41.380
just so that while they're stuck in Antarctica

01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:44.820
over the winter, for instance, that wouldn't be a problem.

01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:47.260
There's many other issues that can arise.

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:49.660
But so those are some decisions to make.

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.100
Maybe the people who go into Mars

01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:52.380
should have their appendix removed,

01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:53.820
their gallbladder removed.

01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.220
Maybe they should have a cardiac cath

01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:56.900
to see if they have coronary artery disease

01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:58.980
just to know their chances of getting a heart attack there,

01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:00.940
though it's not always predictive.

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:02.660
It's hard to predict who's gonna get a heart attack,

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:04.940
but maybe with all the data around today,

01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:06.700
it will get better at predicting.

01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:08.100
But that will be a huge part.

01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:11.660
We can't have people, the few pioneers in a Mars colony

01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:13.140
dying of heart attacks and things like that.

01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:13.980
Don't anticipate stuff.

01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:17.700
Would you go, you've gone to some harsh conditions

01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:18.580
to be a doctor.

01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:21.140
Would you go to Mars to be a doctor?

01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:23.660
It would definitely be amazing,

01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:26.500
I think because I have a wife and two small children,

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:29.500
probably not in the cards for me at this point.

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:30.420
But-

01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:33.100
You humans with your human attachments.

01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:34.020
Sex and death.

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:38.900
If you just put more priority on the death than the sex,

01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:42.540
I think we would be better off, no.

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:44.700
I would love to go to Mars.

01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:48.220
And actually, I practice high-altitude medicine in Nepal.

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.460
Space medicine is sort of an extension of that.

01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:53.140
The air is just much thinner, like non-existent.

01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:54.660
As you go higher in the mountains,

01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:56.380
the things that happen to human physiology

01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:58.780
are very bizarre and strange

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:01.660
and still not well explained by science.

01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:03.940
And in space, it's just like a crazy extension

01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:05.300
of high-altitude.

01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:10.140
If I could just return to the, we didn't really,

01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:13.300
I think we mentioned a little bit about the food you had.

01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:15.500
Just if we can high-level say,

01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:18.620
what is the greatest meal you've ever had?

01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:21.020
So your last meal, let's go.

01:53:21.020 --> 01:53:26.020
If one more meal, I get to murder you after this.

01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:28.180
This is your last day, we get to spend it together.

01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:29.580
Where in the world would you go?

01:53:29.580 --> 01:53:30.780
What would you eat?

01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:36.260
I would say the most delicious thing is bone marrow.

01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:38.180
And I would love a full meal of bone marrow

01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:40.060
for my last, last dish.

01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:43.140
I did on my birthday in 2002,

01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:46.820
ate a kilogram and a half of crab meat and Kamchatka.

01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:50.300
And that was also amazingly delicious.

01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:52.540
The king crab they have there is incredible.

01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:54.900
But I would go with bone marrow,

01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:57.980
which is I think just one of the most delicious foods.

01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:00.100
And it's sort of this weird body part.

01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:02.620
It's basically all your stem cells, not all of them,

01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:05.020
but the stem cells that produce all your blood cells.

01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:07.660
So they are spitting out billions of white blood cells,

01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:09.780
red blood cells and platelets every day.

01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:12.580
And there's a bunch of fat in there as well.

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:14.460
Just one of the places the body stores fat.

01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.380
And so you basically add heat and that's all you need.

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.780
It's like the perfect food.

01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:21.220
You add heat, the fat for frying the stem cells

01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:22.260
is already there.

01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:25.540
There's naturally a bone vessel to contain it all.

01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:27.660
Probably add some flavor too.

01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:29.180
It's like the perfect food.

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:32.540
Does it matter which animal?

01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:35.740
I prefer a larger animal just so there's more of it.

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:37.340
I actually like, oh, that's true.

01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:39.180
I actually really like sort of bone marrow

01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:40.700
from like chicken bones.

01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:42.580
Right, just sucking it out of the bone.

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:46.700
Yes, I'm known for leaving absolutely nothing edible

01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.860
on the plate except bone itself.

01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.300
There's one other human I know

01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:55.460
that loves bone marrow as much as you do

01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.140
and that's Joe Rogan.

01:54:57.180 --> 01:55:01.540
So go, it's unnatural how much that man loves bone marrow.

01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:02.460
I understand why.

01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:03.820
I love the steak part.

01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:07.660
The bone marrow, you know what, let me argue with you

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:12.180
because I don't know, it could be an acquired taste

01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:16.420
but there's just too much, it's like too much

01:55:17.620 --> 01:55:19.300
with too little work for it.

01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:23.780
Like it's as if you gave me lobster meat

01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:26.700
without the lobster having to clean the lobster.

01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:30.540
I just feel like I'm spoiling myself.

01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:31.780
So it's very fatty.

01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:34.420
It's, I don't know, maybe I wanna work

01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:36.140
for something that tastes like that.

01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:37.540
Well, if you start from the whole animal,

01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:39.300
you do have to work to get at it, right?

01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:43.220
A lot of animals have the teeth and the jaw muscles

01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.020
to chomp through bone, we do not.

01:55:45.020 --> 01:55:49.300
So when you buy it from the store, it's already sawed up

01:55:49.300 --> 01:55:52.220
but I've definitely gotten marrow out of deer bones

01:55:52.220 --> 01:55:55.260
with a hatchet and just chop off the fat end

01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:56.500
and start spooning it out.

01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:59.060
Or maybe I'll revisit it, that's fascinating.

01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:01.860
And where, where would you eat it?

01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:04.220
Where and which place of the world?

01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:08.980
Is there something about who cooks it, who you eat it with?

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:12.380
You're not allowed to pick your family.

01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:13.220
Right.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:21.380
So like which place in the world, rural or in a city,

01:56:21.380 --> 01:56:22.220
those kinds of things,

01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:24.380
you've been to so many fascinating places.

01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:27.700
I would say Antarctica, I would say,

01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:30.820
is one of the most picturesque places I've ever been.

01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:34.420
I really did not, I didn't know how mountainous it was.

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.780
And I guess I knew there'd be ice,

01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:39.140
but just I didn't know how much ice it was.

01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:41.740
You know, it's ice and mountains, just overwhelming.

01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:44.780
I just, you know, as kind of overwhelming bone marrow

01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:47.660
might seem to you, sort of that feast for your eyes.

01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:51.260
And just ice in general is amazing.

01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:53.620
Like the icebergs floating around Antarctica

01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:55.260
is just astounding.

01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:59.540
Like the different shapes, the sizes are incredible.

01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:02.140
There's actually a, I believe it's US Navy website

01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:03.940
that tracks the largest icebergs

01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:06.460
and you can read about each of them and how big they are.

01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:10.100
And just the formations you see similar up near Greenland,

01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:12.580
though I have not been to Greenland.

01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:14.380
Just ice in general is just amazing.

01:57:14.380 --> 01:57:16.300
So I could just look at its different forms

01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:19.140
while eating bone marrow forever until you kill me.

01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:21.580
Yeah, and afterwards we go.

01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:23.980
It's back to the death of the death and sex.

01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:26.900
What is it about the ice?

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:29.780
Is it sort of the enormity of nature?

01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:33.380
It just reminds you that it's going to be there

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:36.420
before you and after, and then you get to partake

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:40.740
in the eating of the thing you need for maintaining

01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:44.500
of your biological, temporary biological organism?

01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:47.140
Yeah, I think it's a few things.

01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.420
One is just the shapes that you see, you know,

01:57:49.420 --> 01:57:53.540
the wave action, just eating away at these pieces of ice.

01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:55.940
You get these arches and just these shapes.

01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:57.500
I mean, it's just like geometry.

01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.420
The geometry alone is amazing.

01:57:59.420 --> 01:58:01.220
I studied math as an undergrad

01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:03.940
and I've always appreciated geometry.

01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:07.980
And just the shapes alone are just look like brilliant works

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:12.660
of modernist art and just obviously no two are ever the same.

01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:16.100
Not to mention a lot of them are this unearthly blue color

01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:18.940
that is just really startling and fascinating.

01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:22.900
The same color of glaciers in various parts of the world.

01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:26.260
That blue color is just really amazing.

01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:29.820
And I also just love how it's sort of this constant shedding

01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:31.900
from our Antarctic continent, from Greenland.

01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:34.460
You know, it's this constant process of snow falling inland

01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:36.980
and pushing the glaciers further out to sea

01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:38.580
and then breaking loose.

01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:41.060
I mean, obviously it seems to be happening faster these days,

01:58:41.060 --> 01:58:43.300
but it's sort of this constant shedding

01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:45.140
and sort of, I always like thinking about

01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:46.420
how the body has something similar.

01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:48.580
You know, we're constantly shedding and renewing

01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:51.420
and rebuilding everything.

01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:55.220
And so ice is sort of this constant similar process.

01:58:56.940 --> 01:59:00.620
Yeah, I did not know you were a math undergrad.

01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.820
So that, I mean, you're just keep getting more fascinating.

01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:08.260
Can you maybe take a small step into that direction?

01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:11.980
What do you find beautiful about mathematics?

01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:15.540
Why did you journey into that part of the world for a time?

01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:17.540
I liked math, I especially liked,

01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:20.660
so college math, I did some calculus in high school.

01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:21.980
When I got to college math,

01:59:21.980 --> 01:59:24.980
I was amazed that there were no more numbers.

01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:26.660
You know, the digits disappeared.

01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:29.660
It was just variables, concepts.

01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:32.300
You know, there was almost no more numbers at all.

01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:34.700
It was like this totally abstract,

01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:38.060
you know, kind of way of thinking,

01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:39.980
but that sort of reflects the natural world

01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:41.660
and teaches you about the natural world,

01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:43.860
though it's sort of this perfect, you know,

01:59:43.860 --> 01:59:46.500
platonic ideal perhaps of the natural world

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:48.660
that can still sort of help explain

01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.140
what happens in the natural world.

01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:54.820
But just these concepts are so abstract from like life

01:59:54.820 --> 01:59:57.220
and from, you know, the natural world.

01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.220
I was actually getting interested in the natural world

01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:03.180
at the same time when I was at NYU studying math.

02:00:03.180 --> 02:00:06.180
You know, I took a tour of Central Park that was pointing,

02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:08.060
the guy Steve Brill was pointing out

02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:09.820
these wild edible plants.

02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:12.060
And I was learning to identify the first plants

02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:13.980
and knowing what's edible, what's not.

02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:15.820
That was totally fascinating.

02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:17.460
And sort of this kind of thing

02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:19.340
that I felt like was connecting me to nature.

02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:23.780
And it was balanced with this utterly abstract science,

02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:25.700
you know, or utterly abstract lessons

02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:27.260
I was getting in math class

02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:29.180
where I was thinking through series, you know,

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.340
as we approach infinity,

02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:31.780
what happens to these equations

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:35.260
and concepts of like rings and abstract algebra.

02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:37.140
I don't know, it was just this dichotomy

02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:40.100
that I enjoyed both aspects of.

02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:45.060
Yeah, the concepts, but so different,

02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:50.100
this kind of logical, rigorous view of the world

02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:52.060
and the world of biology.

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:55.620
Why the big, how did that feel to take the leap

02:00:55.620 --> 02:01:00.620
into the biological, the mushy mess of the human body

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:04.820
from the mathematical, which is all very clean?

02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:07.340
Right, it does feel like a big step.

02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:09.540
I think there's more connection than you think.

02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:12.540
You know, we talked about symmetry of the body earlier.

02:01:12.540 --> 02:01:13.660
That is a real thing.

02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:18.220
Fluid dynamics of how our various bodily fluids flow

02:01:18.220 --> 02:01:20.140
and what makes them not flow as well

02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:21.460
and what makes them flow better.

02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:25.020
And, you know, all these different aspects of science

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:26.100
go into the body.

02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:31.980
You know, everything from hard bone to softer kind of flesh

02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:35.980
to liquids of various consistencies.

02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:38.980
You know, a lot of science and math does teach you

02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:41.500
about kind of how the body works, how it can work better,

02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:43.860
what happens in sort of disease states.

02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:49.100
Yeah, I suppose there's a connection.

02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:54.100
There's also kind of sort of computational biologists.

02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:58.540
This computational equivalence of each of the disciplines

02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:00.740
which are becoming more and more fascinating

02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.820
with all the work that DeepMind is doing

02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:04.900
and the work of genetics, all that kind of stuff,

02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:06.980
simulating different parts of the body

02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:09.860
to try to gain an intuition, understanding of it.

02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:12.780
That to me is super fascinating,

02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:15.300
but sometimes it does feel like an oversimplification

02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:16.660
of the way the body really does it

02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:21.660
because the body is an incredibly weird complex system

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:25.060
and it finds a way.

02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:27.340
The adaptability, the resilience,

02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:31.180
the redundancy that's built in, it's weird.

02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:34.780
It's incredibly powerful and so unlike

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:38.540
the kind of computer-based systems that we build,

02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:41.220
at least we engineer in the software engineering world,

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:43.820
which kind of starts to make you think,

02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:47.860
how can we engineer computer systems in a different way

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:50.540
that make them more resilient in the real world?

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.580
That's sort of the robotics question.

02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:55.420
What do you think about that?

02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:59.100
What does it take to build a humanoid robot

02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:02.420
or robots that are as resilient as the human body?

02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:04.100
How difficult do you think is that problem?

02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:06.540
Having studied the human body,

02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:10.660
how hard is the engineering problem of building systems

02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:13.020
like that guy over there, the legged guy

02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:15.660
that is as resilient as the human body

02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.500
to the harsh conditions of the real world?

02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:20.860
I think it's very hard

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:22.340
and we definitely haven't gotten there yet.

02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:23.860
I think we could probably learn lessons

02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:26.460
from people who are trying to grow artificial organs

02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:29.700
in the lab to eventually transplant into people,

02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:31.300
which would solve a huge problem

02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:33.380
of needing to get those organs from others

02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:35.900
and the rejection of putting a foreign material

02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:39.100
inside your body, your immune system tends not to like that.

02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:42.700
That has advanced a lot recently.

02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:46.740
I think some advances actually have been

02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:48.980
where we pay a lot of attention to stem cells,

02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:49.940
stem cells, stem cells,

02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:51.820
we can grow whatever we want out of stem cells,

02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:54.220
but now there's sort of a recognition

02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:57.140
that what we call the extracellular matrix,

02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:00.220
which is sort of the foundation of the body,

02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:02.900
the thing that holds all the cells into their proper shape

02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:04.700
and keeps them where they should be.

02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:07.060
That is actually crucial

02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:09.180
and there's probably a lot of signaling that goes on,

02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:12.700
like you stick a stem cell on the right extracellular matrix,

02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:14.820
it will turn into the kind of cell that you want

02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:17.900
and take the right shape and position and start functioning.

02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:21.220
I think that's been a huge advance

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:24.620
knowing that it's not just these celebrity stem cells

02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:27.860
that are the answer, it's this kind of part in the background,

02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.660
this sort of just like laying the foundation,

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:32.140
the system that you put these cells onto.

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:33.260
And we're not there yet,

02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:35.460
but there's definitely a lot happening,

02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:36.620
a lot of research happening

02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:39.660
and I think there'll be some advances probably soon.

02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:42.700
So now on the topic of interaction

02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:47.540
of computational systems with biology.

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:49.660
So if you look at a company like Neuralink

02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:53.220
or the whole effort of brain-computer interfaces,

02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:55.740
now there's a neurosurgery component there.

02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:59.900
We have to connect electrical systems

02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:04.500
with biological systems.

02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:08.140
So just even the implanting is difficult,

02:05:09.140 --> 02:05:11.100
then the communication is difficult.

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:13.660
But what would you say from what you know about the brain,

02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:15.300
what you know about the human body

02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:18.300
and all the beautiful mess that's there,

02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:20.580
how difficult is the effort of Neuralink?

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:22.420
Do you think it's feasible?

02:05:22.420 --> 02:05:24.860
I think it's definitely feasible.

02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:27.980
I think we need to probably know more than we do

02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:31.540
and know how to connect it in all these ways.

02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:35.780
I think some advances, for instance, much less sexy,

02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:38.060
but really already impacting medical care

02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:40.260
is something called deep brain stimulation,

02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:42.260
which is done for Parkinson's disease and others

02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:45.820
where neurosurgeons implant this device

02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:48.980
that electrically stimulates the part of the brain

02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:51.620
that is not functioning in Parkinson's disease.

02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:53.740
And it's quite dramatic how effective it works.

02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:57.220
And I remember as a med student watching a neurologist

02:05:57.220 --> 02:06:00.340
literally turn the electricity up on this handheld thing

02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:03.060
and you could see the person's Parkinson tremor go away

02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:06.660
and you could see them start to walk in a more steady fashion.

02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:09.380
And I know there's studies, there's actually studies

02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:11.980
or there may be studies in the future

02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:14.140
studying the same deep brain stimulation

02:06:14.140 --> 02:06:18.420
for everything from eating disorders to severe OCD,

02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:21.100
like severe OCD, like paralyzing OCD,

02:06:21.100 --> 02:06:23.260
not just like I want to wash my hands three times,

02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:28.260
but and so I think the potential is there,

02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:33.540
but I guess connecting the brain in a microscopic way

02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.540
in sort of a multifaceted way,

02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:37.340
there needs to be sort of a million connections

02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:39.500
or some very high number of connections

02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:40.540
for them to work fluidly.

02:06:40.540 --> 02:06:43.340
As far as I know, I'm not an expert in the area.

02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:46.700
First of all, I believe and I trust in the adaptability

02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:49.140
of the biological system to whatever crazy stuff

02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.940
you try to shove in there.

02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:54.040
So it's going to potentially reject things,

02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:57.780
but it's also going to, if it doesn't reject things, adapt.

02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:00.380
And if we can create computational systems

02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:03.620
that also adapt, AI systems that adapt

02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:07.260
and can kind of both of them reach towards each other

02:07:07.260 --> 02:07:08.820
and figure stuff out,

02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:12.140
but actually our current AI systems are not very adaptable

02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:17.300
to the, like in the wild way that biology is adaptable,

02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:19.540
like adaptable to anything.

02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:21.820
And if we can build AI systems like that,

02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:24.040
I feel like there's some interesting things you could do,

02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:25.660
but of course there's ethics

02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:29.900
and there's real human lives at stake.

02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:32.860
And there you can't quite experiment.

02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:35.060
You have to have things that work

02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:36.460
and maybe simulation can help,

02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:41.460
but reality is it's a dangerous playground to play on.

02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:45.580
It is messy.

02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:46.980
You tweeted that quote,

02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:49.860
if you look back from far enough into the future,

02:07:49.860 --> 02:07:52.920
every doctor today will look like a total quack.

02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:58.860
First of all, that's humbling to think about.

02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:03.500
Like we don't know what we're doing in the great,

02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:05.840
like there's been so much progress

02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:07.660
that we kind of have this confidence

02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:09.500
that we figured it all out.

02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:13.100
If you look at history and you read how people thought,

02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:14.740
I mean, there's so many moments in history

02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:18.260
where people really thought that they figured it all out.

02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:21.640
It's almost like there's nothing else left to do

02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:23.780
at every stage in history.

02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:25.820
And then you realize no,

02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:30.140
progress often happens like exponentially.

02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:32.140
And every moment you continue to think

02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:33.540
you figured it all out.

02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.220
But if you're being honest,

02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:37.500
if you're being humble,

02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:39.460
then you realize we're just shrouded in mystery.

02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.620
So what do we make of this?

02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:42.820
Like how should we feel that?

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:44.940
How should you feel as a doctor?

02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:48.980
How should we feel as scientific explorers

02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:50.100
of the human body?

02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:51.980
The fact that we're probably going to be wrong

02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:54.740
about everything we currently know.

02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:56.720
Right, there's a saying actually,

02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:58.100
by the time you finish med school,

02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:00.620
half of what you learned is wrong,

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:02.460
which is quite illustrative.

02:09:02.460 --> 02:09:05.780
And becoming more true as time goes on,

02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:07.360
so much medical research going on,

02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:08.540
so much learning going on,

02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:10.760
it's really wonderful in a way.

02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:13.740
But in some ways we still learn these concepts

02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:14.560
from the past.

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:17.640
And I know when you take a test as a medical student,

02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:21.940
sometimes you know they want you to give the old answer,

02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:23.780
but you know there's a new answer

02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:24.600
because of recent science,

02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:26.020
but you know to give the old answer,

02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:28.500
that's now incorrect to get the question right on the test.

02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:30.260
That happens actually quite a bit

02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:32.040
because things change so quickly.

02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:36.900
Yet, when I look back at doctors from centuries past,

02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:39.600
I mean, it's absurd what they were doing to their patients.

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:41.440
I mean, probably for most of human history,

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.580
they were doing more harm than good.

02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:45.540
They're draining people of their blood.

02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:50.480
Bloodletting was a huge part of medical care.

02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:55.300
George Washington died of a paratonsular abscess,

02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.200
an abscess right next to the tonsil,

02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:59.220
which has the great name of Quincy,

02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:00.580
and they bled him to death,

02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:02.820
I mean, kind of adding insult to injury.

02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:05.740
Doctors are a menace and do a lot of harm.

02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:07.740
I mean, hopefully not intentionally.

02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:10.740
Even medical errors are still a huge problem,

02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:13.660
cause of death and morbidity.

02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:16.460
So we do a lot of things that are not great,

02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:19.700
but our knowledge, yeah, it's very imperfect at this point.

02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:21.740
I do have some confidence.

02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:25.820
Perfect scientific studies that try to get

02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:28.980
at the reality of the universe are essential,

02:10:28.980 --> 02:10:33.020
because when I think of why a certain medication

02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.380
works for a certain condition,

02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:36.140
it might make perfect sense in my head,

02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:38.980
knowing the biology, the biochemistry, the anatomy.

02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:40.820
It makes perfect sense, it must work.

02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:42.360
I gave it to the patient, they got better,

02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.940
and that's happened 20 times in the last year,

02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:46.940
but I'm wrong.

02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:49.440
When you actually do a study, it actually doesn't help.

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:51.180
Maybe it hurts.

02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:55.340
I think the way we explain medications

02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:57.980
working in our minds is often wrong

02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:01.100
when you end up finally doing the study.

02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.780
And some of the most interesting experiments

02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:06.020
involve what we call sham surgery.

02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:08.740
So for instance, people who injure their knee.

02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:10.740
Arthroscopy, where an orthopedic surgeon

02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:13.840
goes in there with a scope, gets bits of bone out,

02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:17.060
shaves down the cartilage, cleans things up,

02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:18.140
and it helps some people.

02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:19.940
But they actually did some studies

02:11:19.980 --> 02:11:22.660
where one group of people got the true arthroscopy

02:11:22.660 --> 02:11:24.620
and others just got sham surgery,

02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:27.380
where they put them to sleep, made little cuts in the skin

02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:29.340
so that they woke up with scars.

02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:31.700
And then it turned out that it's not clear

02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:33.580
arthroscopy's actually helping.

02:11:33.580 --> 02:11:37.280
And the same, there was a recent huge study

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:40.540
of putting a stent in someone's coronary arteries

02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:41.900
if they have stable chest pain.

02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:43.260
Not like I'm having a heart attack,

02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:44.940
you need a stent right then.

02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:48.040
But kind of chronic coronary artery disease,

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:49.360
where every time I run up the stairs,

02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.600
I get chest pain, and then when I rest, it goes away.

02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:54.640
Like obviously, you put a stent,

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.240
you increase blood flow to the heart,

02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:57.520
like how could that not work?

02:11:57.520 --> 02:12:00.360
But then when they did the sham catheterization,

02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:02.520
it actually looks like it might not actually

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:04.720
help better than the sham.

02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:07.320
So I think those placebo controlled studies are essential.

02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:09.120
I mean, it is shocking,

02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:12.080
and this has been driven home during the last two years,

02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:13.520
how hard it is to figure out

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:15.160
what the hell's going on in the universe,

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:16.680
especially with our bodies.

02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:18.860
Like it is really hard to get at the truth,

02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:21.680
and what you think makes sense often turns out.

02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:23.240
I mean, the history of modern medicine

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:26.200
is littered with examples where it made perfect sense,

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:27.720
and it seemed to help some patients,

02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:31.280
and it turns out it's not doing anything, or it's harmful.

02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:33.320
Yeah, there's all kinds of narratives swimming around.

02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:36.280
We convince ourselves as a human civilization

02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.680
that something is true.

02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:41.440
There's propaganda machines, there's just self-delusion.

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:45.320
There's centralized communities,

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:47.000
like there's a scientific community

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
that believes a certain thing.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.280
There's the conspiracy theories that believe a certain thing.

02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.920
Sometimes the scientific community, right?

02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:56.280
Sometimes the conspiracy theorists are right

02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:57.560
throughout human history, I mean.

02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:00.320
And we now think the scientific community,

02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:02.720
well, now the science has really figured it out.

02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:04.760
We're way smarter than we were in the past.

02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.920
And then there's these interesting studies

02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:09.960
that I've seen, I think,

02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:12.520
Rahman Hansen mentioned it to me,

02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:16.800
that if you look at the entirety of medication,

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:19.400
like the effect of medication on human health,

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:21.920
if you do those kinds of broad studies,

02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:23.520
does it actually help?

02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:26.960
Like, does quality of life,

02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:29.520
life's been certain measures of the wellbeing,

02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:34.160
does, if you, and you look at human society as a whole,

02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:37.400
does taking medication or not actually help?

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:39.880
And those studies find there's no positive

02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:41.800
or negative effect with medication.

02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:46.720
And that's a very kind of interesting perspective.

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:51.480
I mean, you could probably argue a lot of ways,

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:52.520
but the point is,

02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:58.280
because you can bring up literally a billion cases

02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.600
where medication has significant positive impact

02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:01.960
on a particular patient,

02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:04.000
but you have to kind of zoom out

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.080
and honestly look at the positive effects of medicine,

02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:10.200
of lifestyle choices, diet choices,

02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.560
of exercise or not.

02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.720
Maybe we'll find a venture

02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:15.680
that exercise is actually bad for you.

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:20.040
Which, maybe like, there's all kinds of things

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:21.040
that we're going to,

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:24.200
I feel like we're going to figure out.

02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:26.840
One of the things I think we're going to figure out,

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:29.160
everything I've learned about my body,

02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:34.600
is that, aside from it being adaptable,

02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:37.280
there's a lot of very unique parameters

02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:38.840
that are opaque to me

02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:41.120
that I'm measuring through this feedback mechanism

02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:43.480
by trying stuff and learning about it.

02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:46.560
And one of the things we might learn

02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:49.520
is that medicine cannot be done

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:51.480
without collecting a huge amount of data

02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:53.360
about each individual human.

02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:56.040
So like, it's absurd to be,

02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:59.560
like if I show up and see a doctor,

02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:00.640
it's absurd for that doctor

02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:03.080
to have just a couple of minutes with me.

02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:07.480
Like, just, like, looking at basic symptoms,

02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:12.520
looking at such, like, crappy data.

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:17.280
Like, first of all, no long-term data.

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:19.520
No longitude, no data.

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:21.000
No historical data.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.480
No detailed analysis of all the possible things,

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:27.520
not just related to your symptoms,

02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:29.200
but related to other things

02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.040
that you're not complaining about.

02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:33.160
Just giving you a full picture of the data,

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:37.320
and then using AI to help the human doctor

02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:39.360
highlight the things that you should

02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:41.640
perhaps pay extra attention to.

02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:44.440
I think we'll look back at this time as ridiculous

02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:47.560
that doctors were expected to help anybody whatsoever

02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:49.200
without having the data,

02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.440
without having a huge amount of data about the human body.

02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:55.640
Like, you have to do so much with so little data.

02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:57.400
It's very 19th century.

02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:58.640
It's very 19th century.

02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:01.000
So it relies on the brilliance of doctors,

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.040
and of course, the intuition,

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:05.160
the instinct you build up over time.

02:16:05.160 --> 02:16:06.720
And that's quite powerful.

02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:09.560
The human brain is pretty damn good

02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:11.200
for using experience to teach you

02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:12.240
how to make good decisions,

02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:16.800
but still, you might as well be bloodletting.

02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:21.520
Like, it's humbling to think about that.

02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:22.480
It's humbling.

02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:24.120
It is humbling, and it's important.

02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:28.960
I think doctors sometimes lose that humble perspective

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:31.920
on what they do, and I think it's very important,

02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:34.120
because as I said, medical history is just,

02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:36.440
medical dogma has been tossed into the trash,

02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:38.520
and it's been so many times.

02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:41.480
Something doctors were sure of was the case is not,

02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:45.040
and it's important to be cognizant of that.

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:52.280
You tweeted about somebody that had a big impact

02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:55.920
just by reading about him on my life as well.

02:16:56.840 --> 02:16:58.800
I still think about him.

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:02.520
Rest in peace, Dr. Paul Farmer, a big inspiration to me.

02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:04.720
His medical career was a testament

02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:07.360
to what a person can do to improve the world.

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.400
So who was Paul Farmer, and what made him a great doctor

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:15.560
and a great man and somebody who was an inspiration to you?

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:19.760
So Paul Farmer was a pioneer of global health.

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:23.040
He started Partners in Health,

02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:25.680
which is a kind of an international health organization

02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:28.160
that operates originally in Haiti,

02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:30.600
also Rwanda and elsewhere.

02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:35.600
And I think he was just so a zealot for getting health care

02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.800
to some of the poorest people in the world.

02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:41.320
And I remember reading some of his books

02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:43.040
and a book about him by Tracy Kidder,

02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.840
that's really great, Mountains Beyond Mountains,

02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:47.800
about how even when he was a medical student,

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.680
he was flying back and forth to Haiti in between exams

02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:55.680
and just with this really intense focus and interest

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:58.520
in getting health care to where it's not.

02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:00.520
And I think traveling around the world

02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:05.280
to poorer places like India, Calcutta, Nepal,

02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:08.800
you really see how unevenly the benefits of modern medicine

02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:10.320
are spread over the surface of the earth.

02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:12.440
Not only because if you're in Antarctica

02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:15.000
and have a heart attack, you're in serious trouble,

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.000
but just medications that cost pennies a day

02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:21.480
can help people.

02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:25.400
A lot of children in India under five die of diarrhea

02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:27.720
and all they need is oral rehydration solutions

02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:30.200
to stay hydrated.

02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:32.520
Most of them can't afford IV fluids, for instance,

02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:35.120
to get admitted to the hospital and really dehydration

02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:37.600
just kills hundreds of thousands of kids

02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:38.920
throughout the world.

02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:41.320
Not to mention, bacterial pneumonia

02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:44.680
also is a major cause of death in children under five

02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:48.080
and many of them not all would be saved by amoxicillin,

02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:49.280
which is just pennies.

02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:54.240
And for me, I had a path

02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:56.440
and I wanted to have a career in global health

02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:59.120
and I started traveling abroad to India and elsewhere

02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.840
when I was a medical student and I continued doing that.

02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:03.600
Paul Farmer was sort of one of the first

02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.880
to kind of open everyone's eyes, I think,

02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:09.600
about the good you can do with just money

02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:12.400
that we would change that we would throw away,

02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:14.160
just put in a person, forget it,

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:16.880
or wherever we accumulate change these days.

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:18.760
So that's very eye-opening.

02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:22.240
And while medical science advances and that's good,

02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:24.440
we shouldn't forget that 100-year-old treatments

02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:25.960
could save lives in parts of the world

02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:27.560
where they're just not available.

02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:30.160
People should definitely read Mountains Be a Mountains.

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:36.840
For me, at least, sort of a person from outside all of it,

02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:40.840
it was the first person to make me realize how difficult

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:45.480
and the amount of humanity that's involved in being a doctor.

02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:50.240
So it's not some kind of cold economics-based argument

02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:52.840
about where to send treatments and so on.

02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:54.960
That is there, too.

02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:57.560
Like you said, basic treatments can help

02:19:58.520 --> 02:20:00.560
hundreds of thousands, millions of people

02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:02.160
in many parts of the world.

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:04.240
But it's also,

02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:08.800
when you have a patient in front of you,

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:11.000
there's some aspect of you that's willing

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.520
to give a lot of your time, a lot of your money,

02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:17.200
a lot of your effort to saving them,

02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.160
even though it doesn't make any sense.

02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:23.920
It's irrational in some sense, but it's also human.

02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:25.560
And that's the struggle of every doctor,

02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:28.040
like when you have to choose how to allocate your time,

02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:29.960
how to allocate your mental energy.

02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:34.200
It's a tough choice that a doctor has to make.

02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:35.360
And it's a human choice.

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:39.720
It's not some kind of cold game theoretic choice.

02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:40.880
It's also a human choice.

02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:44.320
And it can be irrational in some sense.

02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:45.920
People are asking you for help.

02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:48.360
That's basically what every patient interaction is.

02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:49.640
Someone's asking you for help.

02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:52.160
So your inclination is to help them.

02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:54.360
And even if it means going above and beyond,

02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:57.800
I mean, a lot of factors affect how compassionate

02:20:57.800 --> 02:20:59.760
a doctor might be on any given day

02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:02.680
or point in their career,

02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:05.320
their own stress and burnout, et cetera.

02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:06.760
But it's someone asking you for help.

02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:08.840
And so you do what you can to help them.

02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:15.560
You've done quite a lot of things in your life.

02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:18.120
It's been an interesting journey.

02:21:18.120 --> 02:21:21.160
Of course, there's a lot of story yet to be written,

02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:24.320
but what advice would you give to young people today

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:28.280
in high school, maybe undergrad, college,

02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:30.560
starting out on that journey?

02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:32.360
Maybe trying to pick majors,

02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:36.400
trying to pick jobs, careers,

02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:38.680
dreams and goals that can pursue.

02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:39.920
What advice would you give them

02:21:39.920 --> 02:21:41.800
to have a career they can be proud of

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:44.400
or to even have a life they can be proud of?

02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:48.200
Well, I think having passion,

02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:50.320
which isn't always a voluntary thing.

02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:52.200
You just have it or you don't perhaps,

02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:55.520
but becoming passionate about something and following it

02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:59.920
wherever it takes you, I think is really important.

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:03.240
When I finished college and sort of went to Russia

02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:05.040
for the first time, that was in some ways

02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:09.160
the beginning of my whole career and passions in my life.

02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:11.720
And I didn't know what I was going for,

02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:14.160
what was gonna happen, what kind of career I would turn into,

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:16.040
what kind of job would it help me get when I got back?

02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:17.800
I wasn't thinking about any of that.

02:22:17.880 --> 02:22:20.720
I'm very fortunate I got that opportunity.

02:22:20.720 --> 02:22:24.640
I was very fortunate to be able to go and see those places

02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:25.720
and have my mind opened.

02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:29.400
And I think that really just the fuel from that passion

02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:30.560
that was created during that time

02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:32.760
is still 20 years later going strong.

02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:35.000
I'm partial to healthcare.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.640
I love being a doctor.

02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:39.440
I think it's the perfect combination

02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:41.640
of kind of intellectual problem solving,

02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:45.000
being a detective while also working with your hands

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.120
when you do procedures, especially in the ER,

02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:49.280
it's sort of the perfect combination.

02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:51.840
I'm not a surgeon, but I do use my hands quite a bit

02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:55.440
for a variety of reasons.

02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:57.960
And so I always loved working with my hands.

02:22:57.960 --> 02:23:00.840
I loved crafts, especially prehistoric crafts

02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:03.480
before medical school.

02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:07.000
And I just love kind of problem solving, getting clues,

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.600
figuring out what's going on, following your nose,

02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:12.360
using your instincts, your knowledge,

02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:15.080
and also just keen observation of the patient.

02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:16.960
After seeing patient after patient,

02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:19.160
maybe thousands over years,

02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:22.120
you do get this sort of innate kind of sense,

02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:24.320
this gestalt about what might be going on.

02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:26.200
And it's not always a numbers thing.

02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:28.080
That's the thing, there's always,

02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:31.360
gestalt is actually a big part of medicine.

02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.360
You often in ERs or in hospitals,

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:35.920
hear a nurse or doctor say something like,

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:38.000
this patient just doesn't look good.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.920
And it's sort of, you can't point to a number of value,

02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:45.160
a level in their blood, a test, but something about them.

02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:48.800
A lot of that I think has to do with the color of their skin,

02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:49.880
believe it or not,

02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:53.000
which can change in certain disease states.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.280
But I think that it's just medicine combines

02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:00.520
this observation, the skills, the knowledge,

02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:03.040
it's art and science, it's human,

02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:06.960
and it's robotic, algorithmic at the same time.

02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:09.240
And I think it just, yeah,

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:11.760
combines kind of all my passions all in one.

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:14.080
And I would, if anyone's going into healthcare,

02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:15.440
I would strongly encourage them to do so,

02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:16.400
but I'm very biased.

02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:18.120
So with that early passion,

02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.000
whatever that little flame was that brought you to Russia,

02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:24.960
were you able to vocalize it,

02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:27.160
or was it just something like a gut

02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:31.520
that's pulled you towards some exploration of the unknown

02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:33.040
or something like this?

02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:34.840
I think it was a combination of things.

02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:36.920
One was just going to a different place

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:39.920
that was different from where I grew up, you know.

02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:42.160
The suburbs, you know, when you're in high school,

02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:44.240
you hate them, later on they don't seem so bad.

02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:45.960
But, you know, I just wanted to get,

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:48.280
I mean, I'm very fortunate how I was raised

02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:51.560
and never wanted for anything that wasn't rich,

02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:54.520
but just to get out and see a different place,

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:56.560
a different people with a different culture

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:58.560
and history and language and literature

02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.760
and to see different climates and geographies

02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:03.600
and ecosystems, I just wanted to see something different.

02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:07.400
And that, I guess that's what I've sought after ever since.

02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:09.600
So just that was just so fascinating.

02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:12.520
Like my trip to Kamchatka in 2003,

02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:14.120
where I was there for four months

02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.160
and I didn't speak English for, I think,

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:17.680
two months out of it.

02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:20.400
And just, I remember lying on the floor,

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.240
some wooden floor in a hunter's cabin

02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:23.680
in the middle of Northern Kamchatka,

02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:26.160
just being like, what am I doing here?

02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:28.800
This is, I'm just so grateful for like the experiences

02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.000
I was having, what I was seeing and realizing and learning.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.560
It was just, I was so grateful,

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:35.440
even though I was lying on this hard, uncomfortable floor.

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:37.600
It was just like, this is so amazing.

02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:40.520
And that, I don't think I'll ever have another travel

02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:42.000
as meaningful and life-changing

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.480
as that particular trip to Kamchatka was,

02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:47.600
though I'm still striving after it.

02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:51.240
You never replicate that first high, but you always try.

02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:54.440
So I just think that seeing something different

02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:56.080
is kind of the game.

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.960
And there wasn't really a plan.

02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:02.160
Cause I got a chance to talk to the CEO of Qualcomm recently

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:07.160
and his advice is, always have a plan.

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:13.560
And it sounds like you're saying, don't have a plan.

02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:16.120
Don't need to have a plan.

02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:19.600
Just listen to your gut, your passion and follow that

02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:21.400
and see where that takes you.

02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:23.280
Cause it's telling you something.

02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:26.800
Yeah, I think, I guess the plan could be specific

02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:29.560
or could be as general as I just wanna go far away

02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:30.840
and see something very different.

02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:32.240
That's my plan.

02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:33.600
And I did just- That's one line.

02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:36.680
Yeah, it just followed my nose from one thing to the next,

02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:38.600
just being interested, following my passion.

02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:41.480
And again, very fortunate I could do that.

02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:45.800
Are there places in the world you're kind of thinking

02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.600
about that your life might take you at some point

02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:55.040
to be a doctor there for a time,

02:26:55.040 --> 02:26:58.320
to explore for a time that you haven't yet?

02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:00.640
You know, I have some colleagues who do kind of

02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:03.400
global health work in various countries in Africa

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:05.720
and central and South America.

02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:09.960
I would really love to go to some of those places,

02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:11.240
not just for a short trip,

02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:13.600
but hopefully for an extended period of time

02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:17.560
with sort of the healthcare being the ticket in,

02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:20.560
but then maybe even bringing my children or just, you know,

02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:23.520
I guess at this point, some of the travel I dream about

02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:25.080
is sort of replicating what I did

02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:26.840
and showing it to my kids in a way.

02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:29.520
But there's still a lot I haven't seen

02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:31.000
and would love to see as well.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.960
But I think those opportunities sort of lend themselves well.

02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:38.000
As a doctor with kind of the ability to go there

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.760
and sort of help patients,

02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:42.600
but also teach medical students and residents.

02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:45.480
Teaching is actually a huge part of being a doctor

02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:47.080
that's underappreciated,

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:48.840
but that's actually part of the fun of being a doctor

02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:50.080
is that you're also a teacher.

02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:52.120
Of course, the word doctor means teacher,

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:54.400
but it's come to mean something else.

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.920
But, you know, in some of my jobs,

02:27:57.920 --> 02:28:00.640
I'm working alongside medical students and residents

02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:03.080
and I'm giving them my knowledge, my wisdom,

02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:04.320
sharing with them stories.

02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.880
And so that's a very satisfying part of the job.

02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:10.880
If we could take a brief step

02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:15.320
into a dark place together for a time,

02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:20.320
is there, what is a dark place you've gone in your mind,

02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:22.560
in your life?

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:26.600
What would be the darkest place you ever gone

02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:30.160
for a time, for a moment?

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:34.240
And how did you survive?

02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:36.920
How did you overcome it?

02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:39.320
That's a very good question.

02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:44.320
I would say I haven't had as dark moments

02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:49.560
as many of the people who I care for in the emergency room.

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.200
I'm fortunate in that way.

02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:55.880
I've had a pretty, you know, enjoyable, satisfying life.

02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:59.920
You know, I think everybody has dark moments though,

02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:00.840
including me.

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:03.720
One of the most shocking things I feel like

02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:07.120
becoming an adult, my two big realizations have been,

02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:08.680
one, no one knows what they're doing,

02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:12.280
and two, suicide is incredibly common,

02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:14.400
like in all humans and all societies.

02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:16.160
That I just find shocking.

02:29:16.160 --> 02:29:18.520
I mean, I've never seriously contemplated it myself,

02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:20.920
but I wouldn't say it hasn't crossed my mind

02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:24.480
during some more stressful times of life.

02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:27.600
I think it crosses everyone's mind

02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:29.800
and it sort of, as a kid, I found that,

02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:32.880
I never would have guessed how common suicide is.

02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:37.720
It's an important question to sort of the Camus question,

02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:39.120
like why live?

02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:41.720
Why?

02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:42.800
Why?

02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:46.200
Cause like life, especially when you're struggling,

02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:47.920
especially when life is shit,

02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:51.360
like why am I doing any of this?

02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:54.360
And then on top of that chemistry of your brain,

02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:58.600
it could be as simple as diet and nutrition

02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:02.440
and aforementioned exercise and things like this

02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:04.120
that affect the chemistry,

02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:07.920
such that you're more predisposed to go to the places

02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:10.000
of asking the question why,

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:14.600
and maybe struggling to find a good answer.

02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:18.040
Cause it's actually a question with no good answer,

02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:21.480
except something in your chemistry says,

02:30:21.480 --> 02:30:23.440
well, I kind of like it,

02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:26.160
but there's no good intellectual answer.

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:29.040
And especially if day to day it's pain,

02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:33.600
you get to see these stories of Robin Williams,

02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:36.480
these people that are on top of the world

02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:38.120
from an external perspective,

02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:42.920
but from an internal perspective, it's struggle.

02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:46.240
Every day is pain, feels hopeless.

02:30:46.240 --> 02:30:51.240
And yeah, that's a question we all have to struggle with

02:30:51.720 --> 02:30:53.520
or learn how to ignore.

02:30:53.520 --> 02:30:55.680
Maybe because if you ask the question too much,

02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:59.200
you're not going to find a good answer.

02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:00.440
That's a choice you make.

02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:03.080
I personally think you should ask that question a lot,

02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:09.000
but maybe because I have the luxury of the chemistry I have

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:10.320
where I'm not in danger

02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:14.360
of seriously contemplating suicide.

02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:18.080
But why live is an important question to answer constantly

02:31:18.080 --> 02:31:20.080
and struggle to answer that constantly.

02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:26.080
But people, I've been extremely fortunate to meet people

02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:30.800
over the past couple of years that are really struggling.

02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:36.760
And you have probably met people who are really struggling,

02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:43.200
like orders of magnitude more people

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:45.200
who are really struggling.

02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:48.600
Some of it is psychological, a lot of it is biological.

02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:53.120
And man, life is a motherfucker.

02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:54.120
It's pretty tough.

02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:55.640
Very true.

02:31:55.640 --> 02:31:59.320
I do think also past trauma plays a big role there.

02:31:59.320 --> 02:32:02.760
Like we talked about war wounds and PTSD

02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:05.040
and a lot of people grew up,

02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:07.000
I mean, with just horrific childhoods.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.080
They were abused in one way or another.

02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:12.000
And I think a lot of people who have,

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.920
not a majority, I'm not saying a majority,

02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:15.320
but a lot of people, for instance,

02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:19.440
who I see in the ER coming in for threatening suicide

02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:20.800
or actually trying and failing

02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:22.280
and being brought to the ER,

02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:26.560
a lot of them just have really traumatic experiences,

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:30.120
saw their parent commit suicide, were abused.

02:32:30.120 --> 02:32:32.880
These leave scars in the human brain and mind.

02:32:32.880 --> 02:32:35.960
And a lot of their subsequent lives

02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:38.640
of whether it's substance abuse, alcoholism, et cetera,

02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:40.720
is almost trying to escape from their own memories.

02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:45.480
And it's sort of such this overwhelming battle sometimes.

02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:48.800
Like sometimes people get ruined, it seems,

02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:51.320
and just can't be fixed, you know what I mean?

02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:54.640
Yes, you can improve diet and health and your life choices

02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:57.560
and seek out your passion and exercise

02:32:57.560 --> 02:32:59.200
and those definitely will help.

02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:00.880
But sometimes just like, you know,

02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:02.200
you bear the scars of the past

02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:04.320
and there's no getting rid of them.

02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:07.720
Yeah, I think it's possible to live with them.

02:33:08.880 --> 02:33:09.720
I think so too.

02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:10.560
Through the struggle.

02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:12.880
You know, they give up, you know.

02:33:12.880 --> 02:33:13.720
Keep fighting.

02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:15.760
It is a constant, it can be a constant battle

02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:16.680
for some people.

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:20.320
I know it can be, and I've talked to many of those folks,

02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:24.600
I know it can feel hopeless, but keep up the good fight.

02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:25.440
Hopelessness.

02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:26.280
Keep up the good fight.

02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:29.560
Hopelessness is kind of one of the big suicide risk factors

02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:32.200
that you sort of ask about as a doctor.

02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:33.760
You know, do you feel hopeless?

02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:37.200
And that sort of can be a harbinger.

02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:39.720
I have quite a few dark moments.

02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:44.720
So if you're listening and you're struggling,

02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:47.520
we're in this together, brother and sister.

02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:48.760
Keep up the good fight.

02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:52.920
Life is a motherfucker, as you said.

02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:55.200
It's really harder.

02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:58.000
I think as a kid, you know, in a joy-free childhood,

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.200
you don't realize like, obviously there's a ton

02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:02.080
you don't realize about life.

02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:03.440
But then when you get to be an adult,

02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:07.200
you realize just how complex and hard it is.

02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:08.880
Is it this hard for adult animals?

02:34:08.880 --> 02:34:09.720
I don't know.

02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:10.680
I don't think it is.

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:18.080
So I haven't seen the honesty of biology before you.

02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:21.640
Do you think about your own death?

02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:25.360
Do you contemplate death?

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:26.880
Are you afraid of your own death?

02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:28.280
How do you make sense of it?

02:34:29.800 --> 02:34:31.760
I've definitely thought about it,

02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:34.400
especially maybe while doing certain risky things,

02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:38.000
ice climbing and others, where every time I looked down,

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.080
I thought about my own death.

02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:43.280
But I think, you know, I think having kids

02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:45.280
changes the equation for sure,

02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:48.640
should change the equation perhaps.

02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:51.880
So I think a lot of now when I think about

02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:53.760
what will happen when I die, you know,

02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:57.080
there's a lot of worrying about what will happen

02:34:57.080 --> 02:34:58.400
to the people I care for.

02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:01.520
You know, you think about things like insurance policy,

02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:05.000
life insurance and, you know, disability insurance,

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.280
that's not related to death, but more just injuries.

02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:09.920
And that's part of the weight, I guess,

02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:13.440
that, you know, you feel as an adult

02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:16.560
that I think grows rapidly when you have kids,

02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:17.440
though not only, you know,

02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:19.040
there's other people you can care for,

02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:20.880
your own parents and loved ones,

02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:23.800
like a lot of people depend on individuals.

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:25.440
And so you think about what will happen

02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:27.800
to the other people when you die.

02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:30.360
But also to push back,

02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:33.200
that weight might be something

02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:35.680
you've convinced yourself to think about.

02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:37.680
It's an important way to think about,

02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:42.680
but you focus on that way to escape the other weight,

02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.320
which is at one point,

02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:51.600
this consciousness just comes to an end

02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:54.600
and it's hard to make sense of that.

02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:56.440
We kind of delude ourselves in thinking,

02:35:56.440 --> 02:35:58.160
okay, it just, yeah, it's ends.

02:35:58.160 --> 02:36:00.640
That's a natural way of things and so on that makes sense.

02:36:00.640 --> 02:36:03.760
So we're good, okay, that's the way of life.

02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:07.600
But like, I don't think it's cognitively easy

02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:12.320
to just realize how terrifying that is.

02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:17.320
We love life so much that the end of it,

02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:23.520
it just, it's something that makes no sense.

02:36:24.800 --> 02:36:26.320
And if you linger on that thought,

02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:29.280
I think it's a painful, it's a painful,

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:31.480
I would say even terrifying thought,

02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:34.320
not scared of like, in a way that's

02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:36.680
almost like philosophically terrifying.

02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:39.560
Like, it just reminds you, maybe humbles you

02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:42.520
that you don't know anything about anything.

02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:48.240
But one of the things we do as humans really well is we,

02:36:48.240 --> 02:36:51.040
especially with kids, you realize, okay,

02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:53.520
we start caring for others in the community,

02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:56.280
in the family and so on, and that distracts us

02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:57.440
because then we can at least focus

02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:00.080
on other people's problems and not deal with our own.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.200
Ah, when I was a medical student,

02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:06.280
I was particularly fascinated with kind of

02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:08.560
what actually happens as people die,

02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:10.880
like in the last minute, seconds of life.

02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:12.280
It's sort of surprising sometimes,

02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:14.120
like what actually kills people, you know,

02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:17.200
like you can get a, let's say a bad head injury

02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:18.920
and you know, what kills you.

02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:22.280
Sometimes it's just your consciousness decreases

02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:25.320
and you become kind of comatose,

02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:27.960
you aspirate your oxygen plummets

02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:29.600
and you get cardiac arrest, you know,

02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:31.560
that kind of sequence of events.

02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:34.720
Or, you know, a heroin overdose,

02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:36.600
let's say you stop breathing, similarly,

02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:38.640
your oxygen goes down, then you get a cardiac arrest.

02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:41.440
So I was really fascinated with what actually happens,

02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:43.400
what makes people die.

02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:45.960
And it was sort of a morbid fascination, obviously,

02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:47.800
like most of med school is.

02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:52.320
And I had many instances where I've had patients pass

02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:55.640
and as a medical student, I was sort of learning

02:37:55.640 --> 02:37:57.600
what's actually happening, watching it happen,

02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:00.000
not always being able to prevent it.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.240
It was sort of a scientific exploration.

02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:06.240
Then the patient's family comes in and are just devastated.

02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:08.600
And then it's like rips you out

02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:10.080
of the scientific perspective

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:12.600
and you just realize how horrible death is.

02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:15.560
But the person's fine, you know, it's the family, I guess.

02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:18.800
And that's why it's always, I guess that pointed out

02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:20.720
just how what people leave behind

02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:22.960
is often kind of the horribleness of death.

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:25.200
Like just becoming unconscious and staying that way

02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:28.120
doesn't seem, I guess to me personally, so bad.

02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:30.920
Sort of like going to sleep and not waking up,

02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:33.160
not counting the pain and stuff that precedes it.

02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:35.400
So the actual pain and the actual suffering

02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:39.280
is often felt by the people who love the person who died.

02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:44.000
So both financial pain, psychological pain,

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:47.320
for years, missing them, all those kinds of things.

02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:50.000
Never forgetting the anniversary of their death.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:54.160
You know, just having flashbacks or something reminding you.

02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:57.760
That sort of brought home to me sort of what death means.

02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:00.080
And it was more about what people leave behind

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:01.920
than what happens to them specifically.

02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:04.240
See, I like those concerns

02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:07.880
because I feel like I can do a lot about those.

02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:09.200
Those make sense to me.

02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:12.040
Then just be, if you're a father, just be a good father.

02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:16.000
If you're sort of, you mentioned sort of insurance.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.400
Yeah, there's like financial stuff to take care of.

02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:19.960
What I don't know what to do with

02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:25.800
is the philosophical existential crisis

02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:28.960
of the fact that this freaking thing ends.

02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:32.520
It doesn't, I don't know how to deal

02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:35.560
with the mystery that's beyond death.

02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:36.600
Why are we here?

02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:38.280
Why are we born at all?

02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:39.520
What is consciousness?

02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:41.160
And you just look at yourself.

02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:42.000
What is this?

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.120
Why do I have the capacity to suffer?

02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:46.640
Why, why?

02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:49.160
All these kinds of why questions that don't have answers.

02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:51.600
Speaking of which, let me ask you a why question.

02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:54.320
The biggest ridiculous one.

02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:56.560
What do you think is the meaning of life?

02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.760
Having with this book studied

02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:04.400
the incredible, beautiful biology of life,

02:40:04.400 --> 02:40:07.560
the components, the engineering components

02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:09.920
that make up this human body.

02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:12.320
But when you look at the entirety of it,

02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:15.200
what is, why?

02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:16.200
Why are we here?

02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:18.000
Sometimes probably more often than not

02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:20.320
I feel like the question of why is a trick

02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:21.440
of the human brain.

02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:25.840
And outside of our thoughts, there is no why.

02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:28.120
Why is not something that's in the universe.

02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:30.680
It's just this trick happening inside our brain.

02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:36.280
So why is a game that the human brain plays on itself?

02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:41.000
And then the reality of life doesn't have whys.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
I do wonder if asking why

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.960
is sort of an evolutionary adaptation.

02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:49.000
Like maybe hunting, gathering,

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.280
why does this plant grow there and not there?

02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:53.240
Why do I see the same deer tracks

02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:55.560
and by the same tree every three days?

02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:58.080
Why is this, why is that?

02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:03.480
Why does this plant make me vomit and that plant doesn't?

02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:06.120
I guess those whys are very practical

02:41:06.120 --> 02:41:08.280
and oriented towards survival.

02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:11.760
But then obviously, we not only use why,

02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:14.400
we use it to maybe hunt better, gather better,

02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:16.800
survive better, but then we sort of extrapolate it

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:21.800
into these unanswerable questions about why.

02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:23.920
Like why does life exist?

02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:26.920
And it's possible that they're not unanswerable

02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:30.320
in the long arc of science and history.

02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:33.320
We're just striving for the really difficult questions.

02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:36.320
Right now, we just don't know much about anything

02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:37.840
and so we're striving.

02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:41.280
But there's long, so most of human history,

02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:43.320
we're asking why questions,

02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:47.120
for which we now have very precise answers,

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:48.960
including with biology and physics

02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.720
and all those kinds of things.

02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:54.000
And maybe the why is this cutting edge of science

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.800
of the explorer of the curiosity of the human mind.

02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:00.000
Like man's search for meaning

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:04.240
is the sort of the ultimate driver of the why.

02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:07.920
And it's almost like it could be an evolutionary adaptation

02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:11.400
of asking exceptionally hard why questions

02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:13.640
that will never get answered.

02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:19.120
So you should always have, it's like a queue,

02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:21.680
it's a stack of questions, why questions,

02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:24.520
and that thing should never come to the bottom,

02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:26.280
should always be striving.

02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:28.520
And that's useful for humans to come up

02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:30.960
with better and better ways of survival.

02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:34.760
And maybe in a bigger perspective for the universe

02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:37.120
to figure out something about itself.

02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:39.840
And it's just humans, just a useful tool for that.

02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:42.960
Or life on Earth is a useful tool for that.

02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:47.960
Well, John, for people who should know,

02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:51.080
you're from Philadelphia, I'm from Philadelphia,

02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:54.840
so it's an honor that you would travel all this way

02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:57.560
from a place I love to the new place I love,

02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:00.440
and that you would write this really incredible book

02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:04.200
that celebrates the human body in the most honest of ways.

02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:05.720
And thank you for everything you do,

02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:08.080
for being a great educator, for being a great doctor,

02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:09.360
for being a great person,

02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:12.000
and for spending your really valuable time with me today.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:12.840
Thank you, John.

02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:14.840
Thanks for having me, Lex.

02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:16.360
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:17.760
with Jonathan Reisman.

02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:18.880
To support this podcast,

02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:21.560
please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:24.880
And now, let me leave you with some words from Paul Farmer,

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:27.840
a doctor who has inspired both Jonathan and me

02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:29.520
with the way he practiced medicine

02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:31.240
and the way he lived his life.

02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:35.560
The idea that some lives matter less

02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:38.920
is the root of all that is wrong with the world.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.760
Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
