00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
The following is a conversation with Peter White,

00:02.440 --> 00:04.720
a theoretical physicist at Columbia,

00:04.720 --> 00:06.640
outspoken critic of string theory,

00:06.640 --> 00:10.000
and the author of the popular physics and mathematics blog

00:10.000 --> 00:12.500
called Not Even Wrong.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.600
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.560
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:17.560 --> 00:18.760
in the description.

00:18.760 --> 00:22.400
And now, here's my conversation with Peter White.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.360
You're both a physicist and a mathematician.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.000
So let me ask, what is the difference

00:29.000 --> 00:31.680
between physics and mathematics?

00:31.680 --> 00:33.800
Well, there's kind of a conventional understanding

00:33.800 --> 00:37.280
of the subject that they're two quite different things.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.600
So that mathematics is about making rigorous statements

00:41.600 --> 00:46.600
about these abstract things, things of mathematics

00:46.600 --> 00:48.360
and proving them rigorously.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.000
And physics is about doing experiments

00:51.000 --> 00:53.940
and testing various models and that.

00:53.940 --> 00:56.200
But I think the more interesting thing is that

00:57.080 --> 01:01.600
there's a wide variety of what people do as mathematics,

01:01.600 --> 01:04.120
what they do as physics, and there's a significant overlap.

01:04.120 --> 01:06.600
And that, I think, is actually a much,

01:06.600 --> 01:09.080
much very, very interesting area.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.680
And if you go back kind of far enough in history

01:12.680 --> 01:14.960
and look at figures like Newton or something,

01:14.960 --> 01:17.320
I mean, at that point, you can't really tell

01:17.320 --> 01:19.240
it was Newton, a physicist or a mathematician.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.800
The mathematicians will tell you he was a mathematician,

01:21.800 --> 01:23.440
the physicists will tell you he was a physicist.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.560
But he will say he's a philosopher.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.920
Yeah, that's interesting.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.440
But yeah, anyway, there was kind of no such distinction

01:32.440 --> 01:35.040
then that's more of a modern thing.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.840
But anyway, I think these days there's a very interesting

01:36.840 --> 01:38.120
space in between the two.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.840
So in the story of the 20th century

01:40.840 --> 01:43.320
and the early 21st century, what is the overlap

01:43.320 --> 01:46.000
between mathematics and physics, would you say?

01:46.000 --> 01:49.840
Well, I think it's actually become very, very complicated.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.160
I think it's really interesting to see a lot of what

01:52.160 --> 01:54.760
my colleagues in the math department are doing.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.880
They, most of what they're doing,

01:56.880 --> 01:58.120
they're doing all sorts of different things,

01:58.120 --> 02:00.360
but most of them have some kind of overlap

02:00.360 --> 02:02.360
with physics or other.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.520
So I mean, I'm personally interested in one particular

02:05.520 --> 02:08.480
aspect of this overlap, which I think has a lot to do

02:08.480 --> 02:10.280
with the most fundamental ideas about physics

02:10.280 --> 02:12.040
and about mathematics.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.040
But there's just, you kind of see this really, really

02:17.440 --> 02:18.880
everywhere at this point.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.440
Which particular overlap are you looking at, group theory?

02:22.480 --> 02:26.360
Yeah, so the, at least the way it seems to me,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.200
that if you look at physics and look at the,

02:28.200 --> 02:31.920
our most successful laws of fundamental physics,

02:31.920 --> 02:34.840
they're really, they have a certain kind of mathematical

02:34.840 --> 02:37.800
structure, it's based upon certain kind of mathematical

02:37.800 --> 02:40.760
objects and geometry connections and curvature,

02:40.760 --> 02:43.840
the spinors, the Dirac equation.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.840
And that these, this very deep mathematics provides

02:47.840 --> 02:51.920
kind of a unifying set of ways of thinking

02:51.920 --> 02:54.840
that allow you to make a unified theory of physics.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.640
But the interesting thing is that if you go to mathematics

02:57.640 --> 03:00.680
and look at what's been going on in mathematics

03:00.680 --> 03:04.800
the last 1,500 years, and even especially recently,

03:04.800 --> 03:08.800
there's a, similarly some kind of unifying ideas

03:08.800 --> 03:11.360
which bring together different areas of mathematics

03:11.360 --> 03:12.560
which have been especially powerful

03:12.560 --> 03:13.720
in number theory recently.

03:13.720 --> 03:17.760
And there's a book, for instance, by Edward Frankel

03:17.760 --> 03:19.280
about love and math.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.320
Yeah, that book's great, I recommend it highly.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.160
It's partially accessible.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.800
But there's a nice audio book that I listened to

03:27.800 --> 03:31.920
while running an exceptionally long distance

03:31.920 --> 03:35.520
like across the San Francisco Bridge.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.640
And there's something magic about the way he writes

03:38.640 --> 03:40.520
about it, but some of the group theory in there

03:40.520 --> 03:42.240
is a little bit difficult.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.000
Yeah, it's a problem with any of these things

03:44.000 --> 03:45.960
to kind of really say what's going on

03:45.960 --> 03:48.880
and make it accessible is very hard.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.920
He, in this book and elsewhere, I think,

03:50.920 --> 03:53.640
takes the attitude that kinds of mathematics

03:53.640 --> 03:56.000
he's interested in and that he's talking about

03:56.000 --> 03:59.240
are provide kind of a grand unified theory of mathematics.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.160
They bring together geometry and number theory

04:03.160 --> 04:06.880
and representation theory, a lot of different ideas

04:06.880 --> 04:09.720
in a really unexpected way.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.440
But I think, to me, the most fascinating thing

04:11.440 --> 04:13.840
is if you look at the kind of grand unified theory

04:13.840 --> 04:15.440
of mathematics he's talking about

04:15.440 --> 04:17.520
and you look at the physicist kind of ideas

04:17.520 --> 04:19.800
about unification, it's more or less

04:19.800 --> 04:22.600
the same mathematical objects are appearing in both.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.280
So it's this, I think we're seeing

04:25.280 --> 04:28.960
a really strong indication that the deepest ideas

04:28.960 --> 04:30.240
that we're discovering about physics

04:30.240 --> 04:32.400
and some of the deepest ideas that mathematicians

04:32.400 --> 04:36.120
are learning about are really intimately connected.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.840
Is there something, like if I was five years old

04:38.840 --> 04:40.600
and you were trying to explain this to me,

04:40.600 --> 04:43.680
is there ways to try to sneak up

04:43.680 --> 04:47.360
to what this unified world of mathematics looks like?

04:47.360 --> 04:50.160
You said number theory, you said geometry,

04:50.160 --> 04:52.480
words like topology.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.480
What does this universe begin to look like?

04:54.480 --> 04:57.480
Are these, what should we imagine in our mind?

04:57.480 --> 05:00.800
Is it a three dimensional surface

05:00.800 --> 05:03.200
and we're trying to say something about it?

05:03.200 --> 05:07.280
Is it triangles and squares and cubes?

05:07.280 --> 05:09.440
Like what are we supposed to imagine in our minds?

05:09.440 --> 05:10.520
Is this natural number?

05:10.520 --> 05:13.840
What's a good thing to try to,

05:13.840 --> 05:16.760
for people that don't know any of these tools

05:16.760 --> 05:19.000
except maybe some basic calculus and geometry

05:19.000 --> 05:22.280
from high school that they should keep in their minds

05:22.280 --> 05:24.880
as to the unified world of mathematics

05:24.880 --> 05:29.880
that also allows us to explore the unified world of physics?

05:30.080 --> 05:33.120
I mean, what I find kind of remarkable about this

05:33.120 --> 05:38.120
is the way in which these, we've discovered these ideas,

05:38.240 --> 05:40.280
but they're actually quite alien

05:40.280 --> 05:42.480
to our everyday understanding.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.680
We grow up in this three spatial dimensional world

05:45.680 --> 05:47.520
and we have intimate understanding

05:47.520 --> 05:50.480
of certain kinds of geometry and certain kinds of things.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.560
But these things that we've discovered

05:53.560 --> 05:56.080
in both math and physics are,

05:56.080 --> 05:58.320
that they're not at all close,

05:58.320 --> 05:59.840
have any obvious connection

05:59.840 --> 06:01.640
to kind of human everyday experience.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.040
That they're really quite different.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.040
And I can say some of my initial fascination with this

06:06.040 --> 06:08.400
when I was young and starting to learn about it

06:08.400 --> 06:13.400
was actually exactly this kind of arcane nature

06:14.160 --> 06:15.000
of these things.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.400
It's a little bit like being told,

06:17.400 --> 06:21.000
well, there are these kind of semi-mystical experience

06:21.000 --> 06:24.320
that you can acquire by a long study and whatever,

06:24.320 --> 06:26.760
except that it was actually true.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.520
I mean, there's actually evidence that this actually works.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.960
So I'm a little bit wary of trying to give people

06:32.960 --> 06:35.160
that kind of thing because I think it's mostly misleading.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.760
But one thing to say is that,

06:36.760 --> 06:39.840
geometry is a large part of it.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.240
And maybe one interesting thing to say very,

06:43.240 --> 06:45.760
that's about more recent, some of the most recent ideas

06:45.760 --> 06:48.400
is that when we think about the geometry

06:48.400 --> 06:50.000
of our space and time,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.600
it's kind of three spatial and one time dimension.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.720
It's a, physics is in some sense

06:56.720 --> 07:00.760
about something that's kind of four dimensional in a way.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.680
And a really interesting thing

07:02.680 --> 07:06.120
about some of the recent developments in number theory

07:06.120 --> 07:09.920
have been to realize that these ideas

07:09.920 --> 07:12.720
that we were looking at naturally fit into a context

07:12.720 --> 07:15.840
where your theory is kind of four dimensional.

07:15.840 --> 07:20.840
So geometry is a big part of this and we know a lot

07:20.920 --> 07:24.600
and feel a lot about two, one, two, three dimensional geometry.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.120
So wait a minute, so we can at least rely

07:28.120 --> 07:31.520
on the four dimensions of space and time

07:31.520 --> 07:32.960
and say that we can get pretty far

07:32.960 --> 07:35.680
by working that in those four dimensions.

07:35.680 --> 07:36.720
I thought you were gonna scare me

07:36.720 --> 07:39.320
that we're gonna have to go to many, many, many, many

07:39.320 --> 07:41.080
more dimensions than that.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.160
My point of view, which goes against a lot of these ideas

07:44.160 --> 07:46.480
about unification is that no, this is really,

07:47.360 --> 07:50.600
everything we know about really is about four dimensions

07:50.600 --> 07:54.320
that and that you can actually understand

07:54.320 --> 07:56.000
a lot of these structures that we've been seeing

07:56.000 --> 07:59.040
in fundamental physics and in number theory,

07:59.040 --> 08:02.800
just in terms of four dimensions that it's kind of,

08:02.800 --> 08:07.400
it's in some sense I would claim has been a really,

08:07.400 --> 08:10.800
has been kind of a mistake that physicists have made

08:11.760 --> 08:16.520
for decades and decades to try to go to higher dimensions,

08:16.520 --> 08:19.000
to try to formulate a theory in higher dimensions

08:19.000 --> 08:21.640
and then you're stuck with the problem,

08:21.640 --> 08:23.360
how do you get rid of all these extra dimensions

08:23.360 --> 08:25.080
that you've created?

08:25.080 --> 08:27.440
Because we only ever see anything in four dimensions.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.920
That kind of thing leads us astray, you think?

08:29.920 --> 08:32.760
So creating all these extra dimensions just to get,

08:32.760 --> 08:34.720
give yourself extra degrees of freedom.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.600
Yeah.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.360
I mean, isn't that the process of mathematics

08:38.360 --> 08:41.280
is to create all of these trajectories for yourself,

08:41.280 --> 08:45.920
but eventually you have to end up at a final place,

08:45.920 --> 08:50.920
but it's okay to sort of create abstract objects

08:52.600 --> 08:55.880
on your path to proving something.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.640
Yeah, certainly, and from a mathematician's point of view,

08:59.640 --> 09:01.320
I mean, the kinds of,

09:01.320 --> 09:03.440
mathematician is also very different than physicists

09:03.440 --> 09:06.040
in that we like to develop very general theories.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.200
We like to, if we have an idea,

09:07.200 --> 09:09.680
we want to see what's the greatest generality

09:09.680 --> 09:11.160
in which you can talk about it.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.720
So from the point of view of most of the ways

09:13.720 --> 09:17.000
geometry is formulated by mathematicians,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.040
it really doesn't, it works in any dimension.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.080
We can do one, two, three, four, any number.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.800
There's no particular, for most of geometry,

09:24.800 --> 09:28.200
there's no particular special thing about four,

09:28.200 --> 09:33.200
but anyway, but what physicists have been trying to do

09:33.200 --> 09:35.760
over the years is try to understand

09:35.800 --> 09:38.320
these fundamental theories in a geometrical way,

09:38.320 --> 09:40.880
and it's very tempting to kind of just

09:40.880 --> 09:44.440
start bringing in extra dimensions

09:44.440 --> 09:46.240
and using them to explain the structure,

09:46.240 --> 09:51.240
but typically this attempt kind of founders

09:51.360 --> 09:53.400
because you just don't know,

09:53.400 --> 09:57.160
you end up not being able to explain why we only see four.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.840
It is nice in the space of physics

10:01.840 --> 10:04.560
that like if you look at Fermat's Last Theorem,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.680
it's much easier to prove that there's no solution

10:06.680 --> 10:10.760
for n equals three than it is for the general case,

10:12.120 --> 10:16.360
and so I guess that's the nice benefit of being a physicist

10:16.360 --> 10:18.640
is you don't have to worry about the general case

10:18.640 --> 10:22.160
because we live in a universe with n equals four

10:22.160 --> 10:23.440
in this case.

10:23.440 --> 10:27.880
Yeah, physicists are very interested in saying something

10:27.880 --> 10:31.400
about specific examples, and I find that interesting

10:31.400 --> 10:33.760
when I'm trying to do things in mathematics

10:34.160 --> 10:36.920
even teaching courses to mathematics students,

10:36.920 --> 10:40.200
I find that I'm teaching them in a different way

10:40.200 --> 10:43.880
than most mathematicians because I'm very often

10:43.880 --> 10:47.280
very focused on examples, on what's kind of

10:47.280 --> 10:51.760
the crucial example that shows how this powerful

10:51.760 --> 10:53.480
new mathematical technique, how it works

10:53.480 --> 10:55.680
and why you would want to do it,

10:55.680 --> 10:59.160
and I'm less interested in kind of proving

10:59.160 --> 11:01.400
a precise theorem about exactly when it's gonna work

11:01.400 --> 11:02.440
and when it's not gonna work.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.160
Do you usually think about really simple examples,

11:05.160 --> 11:09.080
like both for teaching and when you try to solve

11:09.080 --> 11:11.720
a difficult problem, do you construct

11:11.720 --> 11:13.600
the simplest possible examples that captures

11:13.600 --> 11:15.720
the fundamentals of the problem and try to solve it?

11:15.720 --> 11:19.600
Yeah, exactly, that's often a really fruitful way

11:19.600 --> 11:22.520
to if you've got some idea to just kind of try

11:22.520 --> 11:27.000
to boil it down to what's the simplest situation

11:27.000 --> 11:28.680
in which this kind of thing is gonna happen

11:28.680 --> 11:30.440
and then try to really understand that

11:31.320 --> 11:33.520
and that is almost always a really good way

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
to get insight into.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.760
Do you work with paper and pen or like for example,

11:37.760 --> 11:41.600
for me, coming from the programming side,

11:41.600 --> 11:43.880
if I look at a model, if I look at some kind

11:43.880 --> 11:47.400
of mathematical object, I like to mess around

11:47.400 --> 11:49.640
with it sort of numerically.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.640
I just visualize different parts of it,

11:51.640 --> 11:54.200
visualize however I can, so most of the work

11:54.200 --> 11:56.240
is like neural networks for example,

11:56.240 --> 11:59.400
is you try to play with the simplest possible example

11:59.440 --> 12:04.440
and just to build up intuition by any kind of object

12:04.480 --> 12:06.880
has a bunch of variables in it.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.080
You start to mess around with them in different ways

12:09.080 --> 12:10.520
and visualize in different ways to start

12:10.520 --> 12:14.760
to build intuition or do you go the Einstein route

12:14.760 --> 12:19.200
and just imagine like everything inside your mind

12:19.200 --> 12:21.240
and sort of build like thought experiments

12:21.240 --> 12:24.880
and then work purely on paper and pen?

12:24.880 --> 12:27.680
Well, the problem with this kind of stuff

12:28.120 --> 12:31.880
I'm interested in is you rarely can kind of,

12:31.880 --> 12:34.760
it's rarely something that is really kind of

12:34.760 --> 12:38.600
or even the simplest example, you can kind of see

12:38.600 --> 12:40.800
what's going on by looking at something happening

12:40.800 --> 12:44.600
in three dimensions, generally the structures involved

12:44.600 --> 12:48.600
are either they're more abstract or if you try

12:48.600 --> 12:50.720
to kind of embed them in some kind of space

12:50.720 --> 12:53.800
and where you could manipulate them

12:53.800 --> 12:55.200
in some kind of geometrical way,

12:55.200 --> 12:57.320
it's gonna be a much higher dimensional space.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.960
So even simple examples, embedding them

13:00.960 --> 13:03.040
into three dimensional space, you're losing a lot.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.560
Yeah, or but to capture what you're trying

13:06.560 --> 13:07.880
to understand about them, you have to go

13:07.880 --> 13:09.720
to four or more dimensions.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.040
So it starts to get to be hard to,

13:12.040 --> 13:14.680
and you can train yourself to try it as much

13:14.680 --> 13:18.200
as to kind of think about things in your mind

13:18.200 --> 13:21.000
and I often use pad and paper

13:21.000 --> 13:24.360
and I'm often in my office, I often use the blackboard

13:25.480 --> 13:26.920
and you are kind of drawing things

13:26.920 --> 13:29.600
but they're really kind of more abstract representations

13:29.600 --> 13:32.560
of how things are supposed to fit together

13:32.560 --> 13:35.240
and they're not really, unfortunately,

13:35.240 --> 13:37.640
not just kind of really living in three dimensions

13:37.640 --> 13:39.200
where you can understand.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.240
Are we supposed to be sad or excited by the fact

13:42.240 --> 13:44.120
that our human minds can't fully comprehend

13:44.120 --> 13:46.000
the kind of mathematics you're talking about?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.760
I mean, what do we make of that?

13:48.760 --> 13:50.760
I mean, to me, that makes you quite sad.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.960
It makes it seem like there's a giant mystery out there

13:53.960 --> 13:58.320
that they will never truly get to experience directly.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.720
It is kind of sad how difficult this is.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.680
I mean, or I would put it a different way

14:03.680 --> 14:06.600
that most questions that people have

14:06.600 --> 14:10.640
about this kind of thing, you can give them

14:10.640 --> 14:13.080
a really true answer and really understand it

14:13.080 --> 14:16.560
but the problem is one more of time.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.360
It's like, yes, I could explain to you how this works

14:20.360 --> 14:23.040
but you'd have to be willing to sit down with me

14:23.200 --> 14:28.000
and work at this repeatedly for hours and days and weeks

14:28.000 --> 14:31.560
and it's just gonna take that long for your mind

14:31.560 --> 14:34.360
to really wrap itself around what's going on

14:34.360 --> 14:39.360
and so that does make things inaccessible, which is sad

14:40.560 --> 14:43.000
but I mean, it's just kind of part of life

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
that we all have a limited amount of time

14:45.000 --> 14:49.760
and we have to decide what we're gonna spend our time doing.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.280
Speaking of a limited amount of time,

14:52.280 --> 14:55.640
we only have a few hours, maybe a few days together

14:55.640 --> 14:57.760
here on this podcast.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.320
Let me ask you the question of amongst many of the ideas

15:02.320 --> 15:05.280
that you work on in mathematics and physics,

15:05.280 --> 15:07.560
what's used the most beautiful idea

15:07.560 --> 15:11.200
or one of the most beautiful ideas, maybe a surprising idea

15:11.200 --> 15:13.960
and once again, unfortunately the way life works,

15:13.960 --> 15:15.640
we only have a limited time together

15:15.640 --> 15:18.440
to try to convey such an idea.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.800
Okay, well, actually let me just tell you something

15:21.800 --> 15:25.280
which I've attempted to kind of start trying to explain

15:25.280 --> 15:27.000
what I think is this most powerful idea

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
that brings together math and physics ideas

15:29.000 --> 15:31.080
about groups and representations

15:31.080 --> 15:33.240
and how it fits quantum mechanics

15:33.240 --> 15:35.600
but in some sense I wrote a whole textbook about that

15:35.600 --> 15:37.480
and I don't think we really have time

15:37.480 --> 15:39.120
to get very far into it.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.080
Well, can I actually on a small tangent,

15:41.080 --> 15:43.640
you did write a paper towards a grant unified theory

15:43.640 --> 15:47.880
mathematics and physics, maybe you could step there first,

15:47.880 --> 15:49.560
what is the key idea in that paper?

15:49.560 --> 15:51.520
Well, I think we've kind of gone over that.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.600
I think that the key idea

15:52.600 --> 15:54.040
is what we were talking about earlier

15:54.040 --> 15:58.400
that just kind of a claim that if you look

15:58.400 --> 16:00.480
and see what's the have been successful ideas

16:00.480 --> 16:05.200
of unification in physics over the last 50 years or so

16:05.200 --> 16:07.800
and what has been happening in mathematics

16:07.800 --> 16:10.840
and the kind of thing that Frankl's book is about

16:10.840 --> 16:13.040
that these are very much the same kind of mathematics

16:13.040 --> 16:16.440
and so it's kind of an argument that there really is,

16:16.440 --> 16:19.720
you shouldn't be looking to unify just math

16:19.720 --> 16:23.160
or just fundamental physics but taking inspiration

16:23.160 --> 16:25.600
for looking for new ideas in fundamental physics

16:25.600 --> 16:27.400
that they are gonna be in the same direction

16:27.400 --> 16:30.240
of getting deeper into mathematics

16:30.240 --> 16:33.320
and looking for more inspiration in mathematics

16:33.320 --> 16:37.360
from these successful ideas about fundamental physics.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.520
Could you put words to sort of the disciplines

16:39.520 --> 16:41.960
we're trying to unify, so you said number theory,

16:41.960 --> 16:43.160
are we literally talking about

16:43.160 --> 16:45.080
all the major fields of mathematics?

16:45.080 --> 16:48.320
So it's like the number theory, geometry,

16:48.320 --> 16:51.040
so like differential geometry, topology.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.480
Yeah, so the, I mean, one name for this

16:55.440 --> 16:57.640
that this is acquired in mathematics

16:57.640 --> 16:59.800
is the so-called Langlands program

16:59.800 --> 17:02.000
and so this started out in mathematics,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.160
it's that Robert Langlands kind of realized

17:05.160 --> 17:07.520
that a lot of what people were doing

17:07.520 --> 17:10.960
and that was starting to be really successful

17:10.960 --> 17:13.640
in number theory in the 60s

17:13.920 --> 17:17.800
so that this actually was,

17:18.960 --> 17:21.160
anyway, that this could be thought of

17:21.160 --> 17:24.120
in terms of these ideas about symmetry

17:24.120 --> 17:26.120
in groups and representations

17:26.120 --> 17:29.600
and in a way that was also close

17:29.600 --> 17:32.000
to some ideas about geometry.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.200
And then more later on in the 80s and 90s,

17:35.200 --> 17:38.120
there was something called geometric Langlands

17:38.120 --> 17:40.480
that people realized that you could take

17:40.480 --> 17:42.520
what people had been doing in number theory in Langlands

17:43.120 --> 17:45.560
and just forget about the number theory

17:45.560 --> 17:48.000
and ask what is this telling you about geometry

17:48.000 --> 17:49.960
and you get a whole, some new insights

17:49.960 --> 17:52.360
into certain kinds of geometry that way.

17:52.360 --> 17:55.560
So it's, anyway, that's kind of the name for this area

17:55.560 --> 17:58.080
is Langlands and geometric Langlands.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.680
And just recently in the last few months,

17:59.680 --> 18:02.760
there's been, there's kind of a really major paper

18:02.760 --> 18:06.640
that appeared by Peter Schulze and Laurent Farg

18:06.640 --> 18:11.040
where they made a serious advance

18:11.040 --> 18:15.960
to try and understand a very much kind of a local problem

18:15.960 --> 18:17.960
of what happens in number theory

18:17.960 --> 18:19.760
near a certain prime number.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.880
And they turned this into a problem of exactly

18:22.880 --> 18:26.560
the kind of geometric Langlands people had been doing,

18:26.560 --> 18:28.880
this kind of pure geometry problem.

18:28.880 --> 18:32.360
And they found by generalizing the mathematics,

18:32.360 --> 18:34.280
they could actually reformulate it in that way

18:34.280 --> 18:36.680
and it worked perfectly well.

18:36.760 --> 18:40.600
One of the things that makes me sad is,

18:40.600 --> 18:44.880
I'm a pretty knowledgeable person and then,

18:45.760 --> 18:48.280
what is it, at least I'm in the neighborhood

18:48.280 --> 18:50.480
like theoretical computer science, right?

18:50.480 --> 18:52.320
And it's still way out of my reach.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.960
And so many people talk about like Langlands, for example,

18:54.960 --> 18:57.640
is one of the most brilliant people in mathematics

18:57.640 --> 18:59.960
and just really admire his work.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.720
And I can't, it's like almost I can't hear the music

19:03.720 --> 19:05.800
that he composed and it makes me sad.

19:05.800 --> 19:09.000
Yeah, well, I mean, I think that unfortunately,

19:09.000 --> 19:13.200
it's not just you, it's I think even most mathematicians

19:13.200 --> 19:15.080
have no, really don't actually understand

19:15.080 --> 19:15.920
what this is about.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.400
I mean, the group of people who really understand

19:19.400 --> 19:20.240
all these ideas.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.240
And so for instance, this paper of Schultz and Farag

19:23.240 --> 19:24.840
that I was talking about, the number of people

19:24.840 --> 19:28.320
who really actually understand how that works is,

19:28.320 --> 19:30.960
anyway, very, very small.

19:30.960 --> 19:35.160
And so I think even you find if you talk to mathematicians

19:35.160 --> 19:38.000
and physicists, even they will often feel that,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.280
there's this really interesting sounding stuff going on

19:40.280 --> 19:42.840
and which I should be able to understand.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.960
It's kind of in my own field, I have a PhD in

19:44.960 --> 19:48.320
but it still seems pretty clearly far beyond me right now.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.800
Well, if we can step into the,

19:51.800 --> 19:54.040
back to the question of beauty,

19:54.040 --> 19:58.520
is there an idea that maybe is a little bit smaller

19:58.520 --> 19:59.960
that you find beautiful in the space

19:59.960 --> 20:02.040
of mathematics or physics?

20:02.040 --> 20:05.320
There's an idea that I kind of went, got a physics PhD

20:05.320 --> 20:07.120
and spent a lot of time learning about mathematics.

20:07.120 --> 20:10.000
And I guess it was embarrassing

20:10.000 --> 20:11.720
that I hadn't really actually understood

20:11.720 --> 20:15.560
this very simple idea until I kind of learned it

20:15.560 --> 20:18.160
when I actually started teaching math classes,

20:18.160 --> 20:23.160
which is maybe that there's a simple way to explain

20:23.800 --> 20:26.120
kind of the fundamental way in which algebra

20:26.120 --> 20:28.080
and geometry are connected.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.680
So you normally think of geometry is about these spaces

20:31.720 --> 20:35.000
and these points and you think of algebra

20:35.000 --> 20:38.800
is this very abstract thing about these abstract objects

20:38.800 --> 20:40.680
that satisfies certain kinds of relations.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.360
You can multiply them and add them and do stuff

20:44.360 --> 20:46.000
but it's completely abstract.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.720
It is nothing geometric about it.

20:47.720 --> 20:51.680
But the kind of really fundamental idea

20:51.680 --> 20:54.680
is that unifies algebra and geometry

20:54.680 --> 20:58.800
is to think whenever anybody gives you

20:59.760 --> 21:01.920
what you call an algebra, some abstract thing

21:01.920 --> 21:04.280
of things that you can multiply and add

21:04.280 --> 21:07.360
that you should ask yourself, is that algebra

21:07.360 --> 21:10.640
the space of functions on some geometry?

21:10.640 --> 21:12.560
So one of the most surprising examples of this,

21:12.560 --> 21:16.840
for instance, is a standard kind of thing

21:16.840 --> 21:18.640
that seems to have nothing to do with geometry

21:18.640 --> 21:22.000
is the integers.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
So you can multiply them and add them, it's an algebra.

21:27.440 --> 21:31.040
But it seems to have nothing to do with geometry.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.760
But if you ask yourself this question

21:33.760 --> 21:36.280
and ask, is our integers,

21:36.280 --> 21:37.800
can you think, if somebody gives you an integer,

21:37.800 --> 21:40.840
can you think of it as a function on some space,

21:40.840 --> 21:42.240
on some geometry?

21:42.240 --> 21:44.320
And it turns out that yes, you can.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.240
And the space is the space of prime numbers.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.640
And so what you do is you just,

21:48.640 --> 21:50.400
if somebody gives you an integer,

21:50.400 --> 21:53.120
you can make a function on the prime numbers

21:53.120 --> 21:55.360
by just at each prime number,

21:55.360 --> 21:58.920
taking that integer modulo, that prime.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.840
So if you say, I don't know,

22:00.840 --> 22:03.840
if you get given 10, you know, 10,

22:03.840 --> 22:05.600
and you ask, what is its value at two?

22:05.600 --> 22:09.640
Well, it's five times two, so mod two, it's zero.

22:09.640 --> 22:10.640
So it has zero, one.

22:10.640 --> 22:13.680
What is its value at three?

22:13.680 --> 22:17.440
Well, it's nine plus one, so it's one mod three.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.960
So it's zero at two, it's one at three,

22:19.960 --> 22:21.920
and you can kind of keep going.

22:21.960 --> 22:26.960
And so this is really kind of a truly fundamental idea.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.280
It's at the basis of what's called algebraic geometry,

22:29.280 --> 22:31.440
and it just links these two parts of mathematics

22:31.440 --> 22:32.960
that look completely different.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.120
And it's just an incredibly powerful idea.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.280
And so much of mathematics emerges

22:37.280 --> 22:39.800
from this kind of simple relation.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
So you're talking about mapping

22:41.800 --> 22:44.760
from one discrete space to another.

22:44.760 --> 22:49.640
So for a second, I thought perhaps mapping

22:49.640 --> 22:51.640
like a continuous space to a discrete space,

22:51.640 --> 22:53.640
like functions over a continuous space.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.480
Yeah, well, I mean, you can take,

22:57.480 --> 23:00.880
if somebody gives you a space, you can ask,

23:00.880 --> 23:04.120
you can say, well, let's, and this is also,

23:04.120 --> 23:05.280
this is part of the same idea.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.040
The part of the same idea is that if you try

23:07.040 --> 23:10.600
and do geometry and somebody tells you, here's a space,

23:10.600 --> 23:12.800
that what you should do is you should say, wait a minute,

23:12.800 --> 23:15.800
maybe I should be trying to solve this using algebra.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.320
And so if I do that, the way to start is,

23:18.320 --> 23:19.720
you give me the space,

23:19.720 --> 23:22.800
I start to think about the functions on the space.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.160
So for each point in the space, I associate a number.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.600
I can take different kinds of functions

23:27.600 --> 23:29.080
and different kinds of values,

23:29.080 --> 23:31.560
but basically functions on a space.

23:31.560 --> 23:36.280
So what this insight is telling you is that

23:36.280 --> 23:39.640
if you're a geometer, often the way to work

23:39.640 --> 23:41.920
is to change your problem into algebra

23:41.920 --> 23:43.160
by changing your space,

23:43.160 --> 23:45.920
stop thinking about your space and the points in it

23:45.920 --> 23:48.240
and think about the functions on it.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.800
And if you're an algebraist

23:49.800 --> 23:52.280
and you've got these abstract algebraic gadgets

23:52.280 --> 23:55.120
that you're multiplying and adding, say, wait a minute,

23:55.120 --> 23:58.560
are those gadgets, can I think of them in some way

23:58.560 --> 23:59.720
as a function on a space?

23:59.720 --> 24:00.800
What would that space be

24:00.800 --> 24:02.920
and what kind of functions would they be?

24:02.920 --> 24:05.760
And that going back and forth really brings

24:05.760 --> 24:08.240
these two completely different looking areas

24:08.240 --> 24:09.640
of mathematics together.

24:09.640 --> 24:13.440
Do you have particular examples where it allowed

24:13.440 --> 24:15.040
to prove some difficult things

24:15.040 --> 24:16.800
by jumping from one to the other?

24:16.800 --> 24:19.720
Is that something that's a part of modern mathematics

24:19.720 --> 24:21.720
where such jumps are made?

24:21.720 --> 24:23.760
Oh, yes, this is kind of all the time.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.200
Much of modern number theory is kind of based on this idea.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.960
But, and when you start doing this,

24:29.960 --> 24:32.920
you start to realize that you need, you know,

24:32.920 --> 24:36.600
what simple things, simple things on one side

24:36.600 --> 24:40.280
of the algebra start to require you to think about

24:40.280 --> 24:42.360
the other side about geometry in a new way.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.160
You have to kind of get a more sophisticated idea

24:44.160 --> 24:45.000
about geometry.

24:45.520 --> 24:49.120
If you start thinking about the functions on a space,

24:49.120 --> 24:52.040
you may need a more sophisticated kind of algebra.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.960
But in some sense, I mean,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.560
much or most of modern number theory

24:55.560 --> 24:58.920
is based upon this move to geometry.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.880
And there's also a lot of geometry and topology

25:01.880 --> 25:03.160
is also based upon.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.040
Yeah, change, change.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.800
If you want to understand the topology of something,

25:06.800 --> 25:09.480
you look at the functions, you do dram comology

25:09.480 --> 25:11.360
and you get the topology.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.640
Anyway.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.240
Well, let me ask you then the ridiculous question.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.960
You said that this idea is beautiful.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.720
Can you formalize the definition of the word beautiful

25:22.720 --> 25:24.280
and why is this beautiful?

25:24.280 --> 25:26.280
Like first, why is this beautiful?

25:26.280 --> 25:29.760
And second, what is beautiful?

25:29.760 --> 25:32.360
Yeah, well, and I think there are many different things

25:32.360 --> 25:34.160
you can find beautiful for different reasons.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.280
I mean, I think in this context,

25:37.120 --> 25:40.200
the notion of beauty, I think really is just kind of

25:40.200 --> 25:43.440
that an idea is beautiful if it packages

25:43.440 --> 25:46.560
a huge amount of kind of power and information

25:46.560 --> 25:48.800
into something very simple.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.920
So in some sense, I mean,

25:52.440 --> 25:54.640
you can almost kind of try and measure it

25:54.640 --> 25:58.320
in the sense of what are the implications of this idea?

25:58.320 --> 26:00.880
What non-trivial things does it tell you

26:00.880 --> 26:05.880
versus how simply can you express the idea?

26:06.920 --> 26:08.520
So the level of compression,

26:08.880 --> 26:12.400
what is it, correlates with beauty?

26:12.400 --> 26:15.000
Yeah, that's one aspect of it.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.800
And so you can start to tell that an idea

26:16.800 --> 26:18.840
is becoming uglier and uglier

26:18.840 --> 26:21.240
as you start kind of having to,

26:21.240 --> 26:22.360
it doesn't quite do what you want,

26:22.360 --> 26:24.520
so you throw in something else to the idea

26:24.520 --> 26:27.360
and you keep doing that until you get what you want.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.560
But that's how you know you're doing something uglier

26:29.560 --> 26:32.320
and uglier when you have to kind of keep adding in

26:33.720 --> 26:38.480
more into what was originally a fairly simple idea

26:39.480 --> 26:41.800
and then making it more and more complicated

26:41.800 --> 26:43.160
to get what you want.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.840
Okay, so let's put some philosophical words on the table

26:46.840 --> 26:48.520
and try to make some sense of them.

26:48.520 --> 26:51.240
One word is beauty, another one is simplicity,

26:51.240 --> 26:53.800
as you mentioned, another one is truth.

26:55.040 --> 26:58.600
So do you have a sense, if I give you two theories,

26:58.600 --> 27:02.760
one is simpler, one is more complicated.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.200
Do you have a sense of which one is more likely to be true,

27:07.200 --> 27:12.200
which one would capture deeply the fabric of reality,

27:13.280 --> 27:15.400
the simple one or the more complicated one?

27:15.400 --> 27:18.560
Yeah, I think all of our evidence,

27:18.560 --> 27:20.120
what we see in the history of the subject

27:20.120 --> 27:24.520
is the simpler one, though often it's a surprise,

27:24.520 --> 27:26.320
it's simpler in a surprising way,

27:26.320 --> 27:29.840
but yeah, that we just don't, we just,

27:31.120 --> 27:34.160
anyway, the kind of best theories we've been coming up with

27:34.160 --> 27:37.560
are ultimately, when properly understood,

27:37.560 --> 27:40.240
relatively simple and much, much simpler

27:40.240 --> 27:41.880
than you would expect them to be.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.520
Do you have a good explanation why that is?

27:43.520 --> 27:46.080
Is it just because humans want it to be that way?

27:46.080 --> 27:47.560
Are we just like ultra biased

27:47.560 --> 27:51.120
and we just kind of convince ourselves

27:51.120 --> 27:53.760
that simple is better because we find simplicity beautiful?

27:53.760 --> 27:57.400
Or is there something about our actual universe

27:57.400 --> 28:00.080
that at the core is simple?

28:00.080 --> 28:01.720
My own belief is that there is something

28:01.720 --> 28:03.920
about a universe that's simple.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.560
And as I was trying to say that,

28:05.560 --> 28:07.280
there is some kind of fundamental thing

28:07.280 --> 28:10.560
about math, physics, and all this picture,

28:10.560 --> 28:14.480
which is in some sense simple.

28:14.480 --> 28:18.560
It's true that, it's of course true that our minds

28:18.560 --> 28:20.840
have certain, are very limited

28:20.840 --> 28:23.680
and can certainly do certain things and not others.

28:23.680 --> 28:26.480
So it's in principle possible

28:26.480 --> 28:29.360
that there's some great insight,

28:29.360 --> 28:31.320
there are a lot of insights into the way the world works,

28:31.320 --> 28:32.720
which just aren't accessible to us

28:32.720 --> 28:34.880
because that's not the way our minds work.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.520
We don't, and that what we're seeing,

28:36.520 --> 28:37.920
this kind of simplicity is just because

28:37.920 --> 28:41.520
that's all we ever have any hope of seeing, but.

28:42.560 --> 28:46.120
So there's a brilliant physicist

28:46.120 --> 28:49.040
by the name of Sabine Hassenfelder,

28:49.040 --> 28:51.040
who both agrees and disagrees with you,

28:51.040 --> 28:56.040
or I suppose agrees that the final answer will be simple.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.400
Yeah.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.640
But simplicity and beauty leads us astray

29:01.640 --> 29:04.840
in the local pockets of scientific progress.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.720
Do you agree with her disagreement,

29:08.720 --> 29:11.160
do you disagree with her agreement?

29:11.160 --> 29:14.320
And agree with the agreement, and so on.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.760
I, yes, I found it was really fascinating reading your book

29:17.760 --> 29:21.440
and anyway, I was finding disagreeing with a lot,

29:21.440 --> 29:23.400
but then at the end when she says yes,

29:23.400 --> 29:26.640
when we find that, when we actually figure this out,

29:26.640 --> 29:28.040
it will be simple.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.320
Okay, so we agree in the end.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.840
But does beauty lead us astray,

29:32.840 --> 29:37.640
which is the core thesis of her work in that book?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.920
I actually, I guess I do disagree with her

29:39.920 --> 29:42.640
on that so much, I don't think, and especially,

29:42.640 --> 29:44.560
and I actually fairly strongly disagree with her

29:44.560 --> 29:47.160
about sometimes the way she'll refer to math.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.360
And so the problem is, you know,

29:50.360 --> 29:52.560
physicists and people in general just refer to it as math,

29:52.560 --> 29:57.200
and they're often meaning out what I would call math,

29:57.200 --> 29:59.160
which is the interesting ideas of math,

29:59.160 --> 30:03.240
but just some complicated calculation.

30:03.240 --> 30:08.240
And so I guess my feeling about it is more that it's very,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.120
the problem with talking about simplicity

30:11.120 --> 30:14.680
and using simplicity as a guide is that it's very,

30:16.120 --> 30:17.600
it's very easy to fool yourself,

30:17.600 --> 30:22.600
and it's very easy to decide to fall in love with an idea.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.000
You have an idea, you think, oh, this is great,

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
and you fall in love with it,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.520
and like any kind of love affair,

30:29.520 --> 30:32.040
it's very easy to believe that the object

30:32.040 --> 30:33.680
of your affections is much more beautiful

30:33.680 --> 30:36.640
than the others might think, and that they really are,

30:36.640 --> 30:39.360
and that's very, very easy to do.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.600
So if you say, I'm just gonna pursue ideas

30:42.600 --> 30:46.440
about beauty and mathematics and this,

30:46.440 --> 30:49.500
it's extremely easy to just fool yourself, I think.

30:50.760 --> 30:54.040
And I think that's a lot of what the story

30:54.040 --> 30:56.240
she was thinking of about where people have gone astray,

30:56.240 --> 30:59.040
that I think it's, I would argue that it's more people,

30:59.040 --> 31:01.920
it's not that there was some simple, powerful,

31:01.920 --> 31:03.600
wonderful idea which they'd found,

31:03.600 --> 31:08.280
and it turned out not to be useful,

31:08.280 --> 31:10.280
but it was more that they kind of fooled themselves

31:10.280 --> 31:13.040
that this was actually a better idea than it really was,

31:13.040 --> 31:15.120
and that it was simpler and more beautiful

31:15.120 --> 31:17.680
than it really was, is a lot of the story.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.280
I see, so it's not that the simplicity

31:20.280 --> 31:22.880
would be at least astray, is that just people are people

31:22.880 --> 31:27.160
and they fall in love with whatever idea they have,

31:27.160 --> 31:30.260
and then they weave narratives around that idea,

31:30.260 --> 31:33.600
or they present in such a way that emphasizes

31:34.640 --> 31:36.760
the simplicity and the beauty.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.180
Yeah, that's part of it, but the thing about physics

31:39.180 --> 31:44.180
that you have is that you, what really can tell,

31:44.180 --> 31:46.560
if you can do an experiment and check and see

31:46.560 --> 31:50.840
if nature is really doing what your idea expects,

31:50.920 --> 31:54.040
you do in principle have a way of really testing it,

31:54.040 --> 31:58.360
and it's certainly true that if you thought

31:58.360 --> 32:00.160
you had a simple idea and that doesn't work,

32:00.160 --> 32:01.900
and you go out and do an experiment,

32:01.900 --> 32:04.120
and what actually does work is some more,

32:04.120 --> 32:05.880
maybe some more complicated version of it,

32:05.880 --> 32:10.800
that can certainly happen, and that can be true.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.120
I think her emphasis is more,

32:13.120 --> 32:14.560
that I don't really disagree with,

32:14.560 --> 32:18.840
is that people should be concentrating

32:18.840 --> 32:22.000
on when they're trying to develop better theories

32:22.000 --> 32:25.760
on more on self-consistency, not so much on beauty,

32:25.760 --> 32:28.320
but not is this idea beautiful,

32:28.320 --> 32:30.400
but is there something about the theory

32:30.400 --> 32:32.480
which is not quite consistent,

32:32.480 --> 32:36.560
and use that as a guide that there's something wrong there

32:36.560 --> 32:40.680
which needs fixing, and so I think that part of her argument,

32:40.680 --> 32:43.960
I think we're on the same page about.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.460
What is consistency and inconsistencies?

32:47.940 --> 32:52.940
What exactly, do you have examples in mind?

32:52.980 --> 32:55.700
Well, it can be just simple inconsistency

32:55.700 --> 32:58.700
between theory and experiment that if you,

32:58.700 --> 33:01.000
so we have this great fundamental theory,

33:01.000 --> 33:02.980
but there are some things that we see out there

33:02.980 --> 33:04.220
which don't seem to fit in it,

33:04.220 --> 33:07.500
like dark energy and dark matter, for instance,

33:07.500 --> 33:09.600
but if there's something which you can't test experimentally,

33:09.600 --> 33:12.580
I think she would argue, and I would agree that, for instance,

33:12.580 --> 33:15.120
if you're trying to think about gravity,

33:15.120 --> 33:17.420
and how are you gonna have a quantum theory of gravity,

33:18.420 --> 33:21.540
you should kind of test any of your ideas

33:21.540 --> 33:24.980
with kind of a thought experiment.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.780
Does this actually give a consistent picture

33:26.780 --> 33:27.940
of what's gonna happen,

33:27.940 --> 33:31.100
of what happens in this particular situation or not?

33:32.300 --> 33:33.460
So this is a good example.

33:33.460 --> 33:34.860
You've written about this.

33:36.460 --> 33:40.600
Since quantum gravitational effects are really small,

33:40.600 --> 33:44.240
super small, arguably unobservably small,

33:44.280 --> 33:46.520
should we have hope to arrive

33:46.520 --> 33:49.640
at a theory of quantum gravity somehow?

33:49.640 --> 33:51.560
What are the different ways we can get there?

33:51.560 --> 33:54.640
You've mentioned that you're not as interested in that effort

33:54.640 --> 33:57.880
because basically, yes, you cannot

34:00.080 --> 34:02.560
have ways to scientifically validate it

34:02.560 --> 34:04.200
given the tools of today.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.480
Yeah, I've actually, I've over the years

34:06.480 --> 34:08.920
certainly spent a lot of time learning about gravity

34:08.920 --> 34:10.320
and about attempts to quantize it,

34:10.320 --> 34:13.620
but it hasn't been that much in the past,

34:13.620 --> 34:16.020
the focus of what I've been thinking about,

34:16.020 --> 34:18.780
but my feeling was always,

34:18.780 --> 34:21.300
as I think Spina would agree,

34:21.300 --> 34:24.180
that one way you can pursue this

34:24.180 --> 34:25.820
if you can't do experiments

34:25.820 --> 34:29.460
is just this kind of search for consistency.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.860
It can be remarkably hard to come up

34:31.860 --> 34:35.020
with a completely consistent model of this

34:35.020 --> 34:37.460
and a way that brings together quantum mechanics

34:37.460 --> 34:39.580
and general relativity.

34:39.580 --> 34:42.740
And that's, I think, kind of been the traditional way

34:42.740 --> 34:44.500
that people who have pursued quantum gravity

34:44.500 --> 34:46.380
have often pursued, you know,

34:48.380 --> 34:52.220
we have the best route to finding a consistent

34:52.220 --> 34:53.300
theory of quantum gravity.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.820
And string theorists will tell you this,

34:55.820 --> 34:58.540
other people will tell you that it's kind of

34:58.540 --> 35:00.140
what people argue about.

35:00.140 --> 35:03.380
But the problem with all of that is that you end up,

35:05.420 --> 35:07.180
the danger is that you end up with,

35:08.660 --> 35:10.180
that everybody could be successful.

35:10.940 --> 35:14.260
Everybody's program for how to find

35:14.260 --> 35:15.580
a theory of quantum gravity, you know,

35:15.580 --> 35:18.500
ends up with something that is consistent.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.780
And so, in some sense, you could argue

35:20.780 --> 35:23.860
this is what happened to the string theorists.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.420
They solved their problem of finding

35:25.420 --> 35:27.820
a consistent theory of quantum gravity,

35:27.820 --> 35:30.300
but they found 10 of the 500 solutions.

35:30.300 --> 35:34.620
So, you know, if you believe that everything

35:34.620 --> 35:35.980
that they would like to be true is true,

35:35.980 --> 35:38.380
well, okay, you've got a theory,

35:38.380 --> 35:41.100
but it ends up being kind of useless

35:41.100 --> 35:43.860
because it's just one of an infinite,

35:43.860 --> 35:46.060
essentially infinite number of things

35:46.060 --> 35:48.340
which you have no way to experimentally distinguish.

35:48.340 --> 35:51.300
And so, this is just a depressing situation.

35:52.220 --> 35:55.340
But I do think that there is a,

35:55.340 --> 35:57.740
so again, I think pursuing ideas about what,

35:59.380 --> 36:01.380
more about beauty and how can you integrate

36:01.380 --> 36:04.340
and unify these issues about gravity

36:04.340 --> 36:06.020
with other things we know about physics.

36:06.020 --> 36:08.860
And can you find a theory where these fit together

36:08.860 --> 36:12.340
in a way that makes sense and hopefully predicts something

36:12.340 --> 36:14.020
that's much more promising?

36:14.020 --> 36:16.340
Well, it makes sense and hopefully, I mean,

36:16.340 --> 36:19.620
we'll sneak up onto this question a bunch of times

36:19.620 --> 36:23.540
because you kind of said a few slightly contradictory things

36:23.540 --> 36:27.220
which is like, it's nice to have a theory that's consistent,

36:27.220 --> 36:29.980
but then if the theory is consistent,

36:29.980 --> 36:31.820
it doesn't necessarily mean anything.

36:32.860 --> 36:35.220
So like, it's not enough, it's not enough.

36:35.220 --> 36:36.780
It's not enough and that's a problem.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.460
So it's like, it keeps coming back to,

36:39.460 --> 36:42.060
okay, there should be some experimental validation.

36:43.380 --> 36:47.020
So, okay, let's talk a little bit about string theory.

36:47.020 --> 36:51.340
You've been a bit of an outspoken critic of string theory.

36:52.420 --> 36:56.660
Maybe one question first to ask is what is string theory?

36:56.660 --> 37:01.660
And beyond that, why is it wrong?

37:01.900 --> 37:04.540
Or rather, as the title of your blog says,

37:04.540 --> 37:06.500
not even wrong.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.860
Okay.

37:07.860 --> 37:09.500
Well, one interesting thing about the current state

37:09.500 --> 37:11.700
of string theory is that I think I'd argue

37:11.700 --> 37:13.860
it's actually very, very difficult to,

37:13.860 --> 37:15.860
at this point, to say what string theory means.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.340
If people say they're a string theorist,

37:17.340 --> 37:19.780
what they mean and what they're doing

37:19.780 --> 37:24.100
is kind of hard to pin down the meaning of the term.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.740
But the initial meaning, I think, goes back to,

37:28.340 --> 37:32.060
there was kind of a series of developments starting in 1984

37:32.100 --> 37:36.420
in which people felt that they had found a unified theory

37:36.420 --> 37:41.420
of our so-called standard model of all the standard,

37:41.620 --> 37:44.620
well-known kind of particle interactions and gravity

37:44.620 --> 37:46.700
and it all fit together in a quantum theory.

37:46.700 --> 37:49.940
And that you could do this in a very specific way

37:49.940 --> 37:54.900
by instead of thinking about having a quantum theory

37:54.900 --> 37:57.180
of particles moving around in space-time,

37:57.180 --> 38:00.780
think about quantum theory of kind of one-dimensional loops

38:00.780 --> 38:03.260
moving around in space-time, so-called strings.

38:03.260 --> 38:06.540
And so instead of one degree of freedom,

38:06.540 --> 38:08.180
these have an infinite number of degrees of freedom.

38:08.180 --> 38:11.060
It's a much more complicated theory, but you can imagine,

38:12.260 --> 38:14.740
okay, we're gonna quantize this theory of loops

38:14.740 --> 38:16.740
moving around in space-time.

38:16.740 --> 38:21.140
And what they found is that you could do this

38:21.140 --> 38:23.380
and you could fairly, relatively straightforwardly

38:23.380 --> 38:26.860
make sense of such a quantum theory,

38:26.860 --> 38:30.620
but only if space and time together were 10-dimensional.

38:31.540 --> 38:33.180
And so then you had this problem, again,

38:33.180 --> 38:34.780
the problem I referred to at the beginning of,

38:34.780 --> 38:37.220
okay, now, once you make that move,

38:37.220 --> 38:39.580
you've got to get rid of six dimensions.

38:39.580 --> 38:42.300
And so the hope was that you could get rid

38:42.300 --> 38:44.780
of the six dimensions by making them very small

38:44.780 --> 38:47.460
and that consistency of the theory would require

38:48.700 --> 38:51.380
that these six dimensions satisfy

38:51.380 --> 38:55.140
a very specific condition called being a Calabi-Ao manifold

38:55.180 --> 38:58.260
and that we knew very, very few examples of this.

38:58.260 --> 39:02.300
So what got a lot of people very excited back in 84, 85

39:02.300 --> 39:05.140
was the hope that you could just take

39:05.140 --> 39:07.020
this 10-dimensional string theory

39:07.020 --> 39:10.860
and find one of a limited number of possible ways

39:10.860 --> 39:14.580
of getting rid of six dimensions by making them small.

39:14.580 --> 39:16.660
And then you would end up with an effective

39:16.660 --> 39:18.780
four-dimensional theory, which looked like the real world.

39:18.780 --> 39:19.980
This was the hope.

39:19.980 --> 39:22.540
So then there's then a very long story

39:22.540 --> 39:24.860
about what happened to that hope over the years.

39:25.860 --> 39:28.700
I would argue, and part of the point of the book

39:28.700 --> 39:33.700
and its title was that this ultimately was a failure

39:33.820 --> 39:36.380
that you ended up, that this idea just didn't,

39:38.860 --> 39:40.980
there ended up being just too many ways of doing this

39:40.980 --> 39:44.020
and you didn't know how to do this consistently,

39:44.020 --> 39:46.260
that it was kind of not even wrong

39:46.260 --> 39:49.540
in the sense that you never could pin it down well enough

39:49.540 --> 39:53.860
to actually get a real falsifiable prediction out of it

39:53.940 --> 39:55.220
that would tell you it was wrong.

39:55.220 --> 39:59.340
But it was kind of in the realm of ideas

39:59.340 --> 40:02.100
which initially look good, but the more you look at them,

40:02.100 --> 40:05.460
they just, they don't work out the way you want

40:05.460 --> 40:07.780
and they don't actually end up carrying the power

40:07.780 --> 40:10.180
or that you originally had this vision of.

40:11.460 --> 40:14.180
And yes, the book title is not even wrong.

40:14.180 --> 40:17.780
Your blog, your excellent blog title is not even wrong.

40:17.780 --> 40:20.900
Okay, but there's nevertheless been a lot of excitement

40:20.900 --> 40:24.180
about string theory through the decades, as you mentioned.

40:24.180 --> 40:27.900
What are the different flavors of ideas that came,

40:29.420 --> 40:31.340
like that branched out?

40:31.340 --> 40:32.700
You mentioned 10 dimensions,

40:32.700 --> 40:36.540
you mentioned loops with infinite degrees of freedom.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.780
What are the interesting ideas to you

40:38.780 --> 40:41.060
that kind of emerged from this world?

40:41.060 --> 40:42.460
Well, yeah, I mean, the problem with talking

40:42.460 --> 40:43.300
about the whole subject,

40:43.300 --> 40:45.780
and part of the reason I wrote the book

40:45.780 --> 40:48.820
is that it gets very, very complicated.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.460
I mean, there's a huge amount,

40:52.140 --> 40:54.500
a lot of people got very interested in this,

40:54.500 --> 40:55.620
a lot of people worked on it.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.420
And in some sense, I think what happened is

40:58.420 --> 41:01.380
exactly because the idea didn't really work

41:01.380 --> 41:03.580
that this caused people to,

41:04.580 --> 41:06.260
instead of focusing on this one idea

41:06.260 --> 41:08.260
and digging in and working on that,

41:08.260 --> 41:11.100
they just kind of kept trying new things.

41:11.100 --> 41:14.100
And so people, I think, ended up wandering around

41:14.100 --> 41:15.940
in a very, very rich space of ideas

41:15.940 --> 41:18.620
about mathematics and physics and discovering

41:18.620 --> 41:20.020
all sorts of really interesting things.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.100
It's just the problem is there tended

41:22.100 --> 41:23.460
to be an inverse relationship

41:23.460 --> 41:26.180
between how interesting and beautiful and fruitful

41:26.180 --> 41:28.900
this new idea that they were trying to pursue was

41:28.900 --> 41:31.900
and how much it looked like the real world.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.580
So there's a lot of beautiful mathematics came out of it.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.100
I think one of the most spectacular

41:36.100 --> 41:38.420
is what the physicists called

41:38.420 --> 41:40.660
two-dimensional conformal field theory.

41:40.660 --> 41:44.700
And so these are basically quantum field theories

41:44.700 --> 41:47.820
and kind of think of it as one space and one time dimension,

41:47.820 --> 41:51.220
which have just this huge amount of symmetry

41:51.220 --> 41:53.660
and a huge amount of structure,

41:53.660 --> 41:58.060
which just some totally fantastic mathematics behind it.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.380
And again, and some of that mathematics

42:00.380 --> 42:03.260
is exactly also what appears in the Langlands program.

42:03.260 --> 42:06.860
So a lot of the first interaction

42:06.860 --> 42:08.860
between math and physics around the Langlands program

42:08.860 --> 42:10.340
has been around these two-dimensional

42:10.340 --> 42:11.580
conformal field theories.

42:12.580 --> 42:15.220
Is there something you could say

42:15.220 --> 42:18.380
about what are the major problems are with string theory?

42:21.900 --> 42:25.820
Besides that there's no experimental validation,

42:25.820 --> 42:30.420
you've written that a big hole in string theory

42:30.420 --> 42:33.340
has been its perturbative definition.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.940
Perhaps that's one, can you explain what that means?

42:36.940 --> 42:38.140
Well, maybe to begin with,

42:38.140 --> 42:40.660
I think the simplest thing to say is

42:41.660 --> 42:45.220
the initial idea really was that,

42:45.220 --> 42:48.380
okay, we have this, instead of what's great

42:48.380 --> 42:50.740
is we have this thing that only works,

42:50.740 --> 42:54.180
it's very structured and has to work in a certain way

42:54.180 --> 42:55.540
for it to make sense.

42:57.580 --> 43:01.700
But then you ended up in 10 space-time dimensions.

43:01.700 --> 43:03.620
And so to get back to physics,

43:03.620 --> 43:05.380
you had to get rid of five of the dimensions,

43:05.380 --> 43:06.860
six of the dimensions.

43:06.860 --> 43:09.100
And the bottom line I would say in some sense

43:09.100 --> 43:11.860
is very simple, that what people just discovered is just,

43:12.820 --> 43:15.700
there's kind of no particularly nice way of doing this,

43:15.700 --> 43:17.500
there's an infinite number of ways of doing it

43:17.500 --> 43:18.780
and you can get whatever you want

43:18.780 --> 43:20.180
depending on how you do it.

43:20.180 --> 43:23.180
So you end up, the whole program of starting

43:23.180 --> 43:25.580
at 10 dimensions and getting to four

43:25.580 --> 43:28.580
just kind of collapses out of a lack of any way

43:28.580 --> 43:29.780
to kind of get to where you want

43:29.780 --> 43:31.580
because you can get anything.

43:31.580 --> 43:33.660
There'll be the hope around that problem

43:33.660 --> 43:37.540
has always been that the standard formulation

43:37.580 --> 43:39.700
we have of string theory, which is,

43:40.580 --> 43:42.580
you can go by the name perturbative,

43:42.580 --> 43:46.340
but it's kind of, there's a standard way we know

43:46.340 --> 43:49.820
of giving a classical theory of constructing

43:49.820 --> 43:52.900
a quantum theory and working with it,

43:52.900 --> 43:57.020
which is the so-called perturbation theory,

43:57.020 --> 44:02.020
that we know how to do and that by itself

44:02.020 --> 44:04.500
just doesn't give you any hint

44:04.500 --> 44:06.700
as to what to do about the six dimensions.

44:06.700 --> 44:09.220
So actual perturbative string theory by itself

44:09.220 --> 44:11.380
really only works in 10 dimensions.

44:11.380 --> 44:14.380
So you have to start making some kinds of assumptions

44:14.380 --> 44:19.380
about how I'm gonna go beyond this formulation

44:20.060 --> 44:21.740
that we really understand of string theory

44:21.740 --> 44:24.060
and get rid of these six dimensions.

44:24.060 --> 44:29.060
So kind of the simplest one was the Claveau postulate,

44:29.420 --> 44:31.860
but when that didn't really work out,

44:31.860 --> 44:33.980
people have tried more and more different things

44:34.220 --> 44:38.060
and the hope has always been that the solution

44:38.060 --> 44:40.380
to this problem would be that you would find

44:40.380 --> 44:44.260
a deeper and better understanding of what string theory is

44:44.260 --> 44:47.900
that would actually go beyond this perturbative expansion

44:47.900 --> 44:51.100
and which would generalize this

44:51.100 --> 44:53.220
and that once you had that,

44:53.220 --> 44:57.260
it would solve this problem of,

44:57.260 --> 44:59.620
it would pick out what to do with the six dimensions.

44:59.620 --> 45:01.180
How difficult is this problem?

45:01.180 --> 45:05.140
So if I could restate the problem,

45:05.140 --> 45:09.900
it seems like there's a very consistent physical world

45:09.900 --> 45:11.780
operating in four dimensions.

45:13.380 --> 45:16.740
And how do you map a consistent physical world

45:16.740 --> 45:19.300
in 10 dimensions to a consistent physical world

45:19.300 --> 45:21.180
in four dimensions?

45:21.180 --> 45:23.100
And how difficult is this problem?

45:23.100 --> 45:25.380
Is that something you can even answer?

45:26.140 --> 45:30.340
Just in terms of physics intuition,

45:30.340 --> 45:32.260
in terms of mathematics,

45:32.260 --> 45:35.060
mapping from 10 dimensions to four dimensions.

45:35.060 --> 45:36.580
Well, basically, I mean, you have to get rid

45:36.580 --> 45:38.140
of the six of the dimensions.

45:38.140 --> 45:41.620
So there's kind of two ways of doing it.

45:41.620 --> 45:44.060
One is what we call compactification.

45:44.060 --> 45:46.900
You say that there really are 10 dimensions,

45:46.900 --> 45:49.300
but for whatever reason, six of them are really,

45:49.300 --> 45:51.900
are so, so small, we can't see them.

45:51.900 --> 45:54.660
So you basically start out with 10 dimensions

45:54.700 --> 45:57.860
and what we call, you know, make six of them

45:57.860 --> 46:00.820
not go out to infinity, but just kind of a finite extent

46:00.820 --> 46:05.500
and then make that size go down so small, it's unobservable.

46:05.500 --> 46:08.340
But that's like, that's a math trick.

46:08.340 --> 46:11.460
So can you also help me build an intuition

46:11.460 --> 46:15.580
about how rich and interesting the world

46:15.580 --> 46:17.900
in those six dimensions is?

46:17.900 --> 46:20.140
So compactification seems to imply

46:20.140 --> 46:22.660
that it's not very interesting.

46:22.660 --> 46:24.700
Well, no, but the problem is that what you learn

46:24.700 --> 46:28.180
if you start doing mathematics and looking at geometry

46:28.180 --> 46:31.580
and topology and more and more dimensions is that,

46:31.580 --> 46:34.180
I mean, asking the question like,

46:34.180 --> 46:37.100
what are all possible six dimensional spaces is just,

46:37.100 --> 46:38.580
it's kind of an unanswerable question.

46:38.580 --> 46:40.900
It's just, I mean, it's even kind of technically

46:40.900 --> 46:42.020
undecidable in some way.

46:42.020 --> 46:46.180
There are just too many things you can do with all these.

46:46.180 --> 46:49.540
If you start trying to make one dimensional spaces,

46:49.540 --> 46:52.140
it's like, well, you got a line, you can make a circle,

46:52.140 --> 46:55.180
you can make graphs, you can kind of see what you can do.

46:55.180 --> 46:58.260
But as you go to higher and higher dimensions,

46:58.260 --> 47:02.140
there are just so many ways you can put things together

47:02.140 --> 47:05.460
of and get something of that dimensionality.

47:05.460 --> 47:09.820
And so it, unless you have some very, very strong principle

47:09.820 --> 47:12.900
which is gonna pick out some very specific ones

47:12.900 --> 47:15.420
of these six dimensional spaces,

47:15.420 --> 47:17.340
and there are just too many of them

47:17.340 --> 47:19.500
and you can get anything you want, but.

47:19.540 --> 47:21.660
So if you have 10 dimensions,

47:22.580 --> 47:24.460
the kind of things that happen,

47:24.460 --> 47:26.740
say that's actually the way,

47:26.740 --> 47:29.780
that's actually the fabric of our reality is 10 dimensions.

47:29.780 --> 47:33.140
There's a limited set of behaviors of objects,

47:33.140 --> 47:36.100
I don't even know what the right terminology to use

47:36.100 --> 47:40.660
that can occur within those dimensions, like in reality.

47:41.580 --> 47:44.540
And so like what I'm getting at is like,

47:44.540 --> 47:47.300
is there some consistent constraints?

47:47.300 --> 47:51.100
So if you have some constraints that map to reality,

47:51.100 --> 47:53.500
then you could start saying like,

47:53.500 --> 47:56.300
dimension number seven is kind of boring.

47:56.300 --> 47:57.700
All the excitement happens

47:57.700 --> 48:00.420
in the spatial dimensions one, two, three.

48:00.420 --> 48:02.780
And time is also kind of boring.

48:02.780 --> 48:05.420
And like some are more exciting than others,

48:05.420 --> 48:08.140
or we can use our metric of beauty.

48:08.140 --> 48:10.300
Some dimensions are more beautiful than others.

48:10.300 --> 48:12.300
Once you have an actual understanding

48:12.300 --> 48:15.300
of what actually happens in those dimensions

48:15.300 --> 48:16.540
in our physical world,

48:16.540 --> 48:18.660
as opposed to sort of all the possible things

48:18.660 --> 48:19.620
that could happen.

48:19.620 --> 48:21.500
In some sense, I mean, just the basic fact

48:21.500 --> 48:23.020
is you need to get rid of them, we don't see them.

48:23.020 --> 48:25.620
So you need to somehow explain them.

48:25.620 --> 48:26.620
The main thing you're trying to do

48:26.620 --> 48:28.860
is to explain why we're not seeing them.

48:28.860 --> 48:32.580
And so you have to come up with some theory

48:32.580 --> 48:35.460
of these extra dimensions and how they're gonna behave.

48:35.460 --> 48:39.020
And string theory gives you some ideas about how to do that.

48:39.020 --> 48:43.580
But the bottom line is where you're trying to go

48:43.580 --> 48:45.660
with this whole theory you're creating

48:45.660 --> 48:49.540
is to just make all of its effects essentially unobservable.

48:49.540 --> 48:51.460
So it's not a really,

48:54.780 --> 48:56.580
it's an inherently kind of dubious

48:56.580 --> 48:58.260
and worrisome thing that you're trying to do there.

48:58.260 --> 49:00.580
Why are you just adding in all the stuff

49:00.580 --> 49:02.180
and then trying to explain why we don't see it?

49:02.180 --> 49:03.020
I mean, it's just-

49:03.020 --> 49:04.220
This may be a dumb question,

49:04.220 --> 49:07.740
but is this an obvious thing to state

49:07.740 --> 49:11.540
that those six dimensions are unobservable?

49:11.540 --> 49:13.500
Or anything beyond four dimensions

49:14.340 --> 49:15.180
is unobservable?

49:16.140 --> 49:19.500
Or do you leave a little door open

49:19.500 --> 49:23.140
to saying the current tools of physics,

49:23.140 --> 49:26.940
and obviously our brains aren't unable to observe them,

49:26.940 --> 49:29.900
but we may need to come up with methodologies

49:29.900 --> 49:30.740
for observing them.

49:30.740 --> 49:33.100
So as opposed to collapsing your mathematical theory

49:33.100 --> 49:34.940
into four dimensions,

49:34.940 --> 49:37.100
or leaving the door open a little bit too,

49:37.100 --> 49:38.700
maybe we need to come up with tools

49:38.700 --> 49:42.660
that actually allow us to directly measure those dimensions.

49:42.660 --> 49:45.180
Yes, I mean, you can certainly ask,

49:45.180 --> 49:49.180
assume that we've got model,

49:49.180 --> 49:50.700
look at models with more dimensions

49:50.700 --> 49:52.620
and ask what would be observable effects?

49:52.620 --> 49:54.140
How would we know this?

49:54.140 --> 49:55.460
And then you go out and do experiments.

49:55.460 --> 49:58.740
So for instance, you have a,

49:58.740 --> 50:01.740
like gravitationally you have an inverse square law

50:01.740 --> 50:02.620
of forces, okay?

50:02.620 --> 50:04.060
If you had more dimensions,

50:04.060 --> 50:06.580
that inverse square law would change something else.

50:06.580 --> 50:09.500
So you can go and start measuring the inverse square law

50:09.500 --> 50:12.020
and say, okay, the inverse square law is working,

50:12.020 --> 50:14.620
but maybe if I get,

50:14.620 --> 50:16.100
and it turns out to be actually kind of very,

50:16.100 --> 50:18.100
very hard to measure gravitational effects

50:18.100 --> 50:21.900
at even kind of somewhat macroscopic distances

50:21.900 --> 50:23.260
because they're so small.

50:23.260 --> 50:26.180
So you can start looking at the inverse square law

50:26.180 --> 50:27.980
and say, start trying to measure it

50:27.980 --> 50:29.340
at shorter and shorter distances

50:29.340 --> 50:33.140
and see if there were extra dimensions

50:33.140 --> 50:34.420
at those distance scales,

50:34.420 --> 50:36.740
you would start to see the inverse square law fail.

50:36.740 --> 50:38.620
And so people look for that.

50:38.620 --> 50:40.500
And again, you don't see it,

50:40.500 --> 50:43.220
but you can, I mean, there's all sorts of experiments

50:43.220 --> 50:46.580
of this kind you can imagine which test

50:46.580 --> 50:48.420
for effects of extra dimensions

50:48.420 --> 50:50.780
at different distance scales.

50:50.780 --> 50:55.780
But none of them, I mean, they all just don't work.

50:57.300 --> 50:58.140
Nothing yet.

50:58.140 --> 50:58.980
Nothing yet.

50:58.980 --> 51:02.900
But you could say, ah, but it's just much, much smaller.

51:02.900 --> 51:03.820
You can say that.

51:05.180 --> 51:06.940
Which by the way, makes LIGO

51:06.940 --> 51:09.980
and the detection of gravitational waves

51:10.020 --> 51:11.660
quite an incredible project.

51:13.300 --> 51:15.700
Ed Whitten is often brought up

51:15.700 --> 51:17.420
as one of the most brilliant mathematicians

51:17.420 --> 51:19.140
and physicists ever.

51:21.100 --> 51:24.460
What do you make of him and his work on string theory?

51:24.460 --> 51:26.820
Well, I think he's a truly remarkable figure.

51:26.820 --> 51:30.140
I've had the pleasure of meeting him first

51:30.140 --> 51:31.100
when he was a postdoc.

51:31.100 --> 51:36.100
And I mean, he's a just completely amazing mathematician

51:36.660 --> 51:38.020
and physicist.

51:38.020 --> 51:41.460
And he's quite a bit smarter

51:41.460 --> 51:43.380
than just about any of the rest of us

51:43.380 --> 51:44.540
and also more hardworking.

51:44.540 --> 51:46.780
And it's a kind of frightening combination

51:46.780 --> 51:49.180
to see how much he's been able to do.

51:50.540 --> 51:53.540
But I would actually argue that his greatest work,

51:53.540 --> 51:55.820
the things that he's done that have been of

51:55.820 --> 51:58.660
just this mind blowing significance of giving us,

51:58.660 --> 52:00.100
I mean, he's completely revolutionized

52:00.100 --> 52:02.180
some areas of mathematics.

52:02.180 --> 52:04.220
He's totally revolutionized the way we understand

52:04.220 --> 52:07.140
the relations between mathematics and physics.

52:07.140 --> 52:11.580
And most of those, his greatest work is stuff

52:11.580 --> 52:15.100
that has little or nothing to do with string theory.

52:15.100 --> 52:19.140
I mean, for instance, he, so he was actually one of fields.

52:19.140 --> 52:20.900
The very strange thing about him in some sense

52:20.900 --> 52:23.620
is that he doesn't have a Nobel Prize.

52:23.620 --> 52:25.900
So there's a very large number of people

52:25.900 --> 52:28.220
who are nowhere near as smart as he is

52:28.220 --> 52:30.100
and don't work anywhere near as hard

52:30.100 --> 52:31.700
who have Nobel Prizes.

52:31.700 --> 52:34.180
I think he just had the misfortune of coming

52:34.180 --> 52:36.540
into the field at a time when things had gotten

52:36.540 --> 52:40.260
much, much, much tougher and nobody really had,

52:40.260 --> 52:42.260
no matter how smart you were, it was very hard

52:42.260 --> 52:45.660
to come up with a new idea that was gonna work physically

52:45.660 --> 52:47.700
and get you a Nobel Prize.

52:47.700 --> 52:50.700
But he, you know, he got a Fields Medal

52:50.700 --> 52:54.580
for a certain work he did in mathematics.

52:54.580 --> 52:56.500
And that's just completely unheard of, you know,

52:56.500 --> 52:58.340
for mathematicians to give a Fields Medal

52:58.340 --> 52:59.820
to someone outside their field.

52:59.820 --> 53:03.060
And physics is really, you know,

53:03.060 --> 53:05.580
you wouldn't have before he came around.

53:05.620 --> 53:06.660
I don't think anybody would have thought

53:06.660 --> 53:08.020
that was even conceivable.

53:08.020 --> 53:11.020
So you're saying he came into the field

53:11.020 --> 53:13.660
of theoretical physics at a time when,

53:14.660 --> 53:18.220
and still to today, is you can't get a Nobel Prize

53:18.220 --> 53:20.220
for purely theoretical work.

53:20.220 --> 53:22.340
The specific problem of trying to do better

53:22.340 --> 53:24.900
than the standard, the standard model is just

53:24.900 --> 53:26.660
this insanely successful thing.

53:26.660 --> 53:30.620
And it kind of came together in 1973 pretty much.

53:30.620 --> 53:33.300
And post, and so, and all of the people

53:33.340 --> 53:35.940
who kind of were involved in that coming together,

53:35.940 --> 53:39.140
you know, many of them ended up with Nobel Prizes for that.

53:39.140 --> 53:43.660
But if you look post-1973 pretty much,

53:43.660 --> 53:47.180
it's a little bit more, there's some edge cases,

53:47.180 --> 53:50.180
if you like, but if you look post-1973

53:50.180 --> 53:53.220
at what people have done to try to do better

53:53.220 --> 53:55.380
than the standard model and to get a better,

53:55.380 --> 53:57.380
you know, idea, it really hasn't,

53:57.380 --> 53:59.100
it's been too hard a problem, it hasn't worked,

53:59.100 --> 53:59.940
the theory's too good.

53:59.940 --> 54:03.300
And so it's not that other people went out there

54:03.300 --> 54:06.740
and did it, and not him, and that they got

54:06.740 --> 54:08.940
Nobel Prizes for doing it, it's just that no one really,

54:08.940 --> 54:10.460
the kind of thing he's been trying to do

54:10.460 --> 54:12.260
with string theory is not,

54:12.260 --> 54:14.660
no one has been able to do since 1973.

54:15.540 --> 54:17.380
Is there something you can say about the standard model,

54:17.380 --> 54:20.700
so the four laws of physics that seems to work very well,

54:20.700 --> 54:24.980
and yet people are striving to do more,

54:24.980 --> 54:27.580
talking about unification and so on, why?

54:27.580 --> 54:30.900
What's wrong, what's broken about the standard model?

54:30.900 --> 54:33.100
Why does it need to be improved?

54:33.100 --> 54:37.220
I mean, the thing that gets most attention is gravity,

54:37.220 --> 54:40.740
that we have trouble, so you want to, in some sense,

54:40.740 --> 54:45.740
integrate what we know about the gravitational force

54:45.900 --> 54:48.660
with it and have a unified quantum field theory

54:48.660 --> 54:50.340
that has gravitational interactions also,

54:50.340 --> 54:52.780
so that's the big problem everybody talks about.

54:53.620 --> 54:55.940
I mean, but it's also true that if you look

54:55.940 --> 54:58.380
at the standard model, it has these very, very deep,

54:58.380 --> 55:01.580
beautiful ideas, but there's certain aspects of it

55:01.580 --> 55:06.580
that are very, let's just say that they're not beautiful,

55:08.220 --> 55:11.420
they're not, you have to, to make the thing work,

55:11.420 --> 55:14.220
you have to throw in lots and lots of extra parameters

55:14.220 --> 55:17.420
at various points, and a lot of this has to do

55:17.420 --> 55:21.940
with the so-called Higgs mechanism in the Higgs field,

55:21.940 --> 55:23.740
that if you look at the theory,

55:23.820 --> 55:27.300
it's, everything is, if you forget about the Higgs field

55:27.300 --> 55:29.940
and what it needs to do, the rest of the theory

55:29.940 --> 55:34.420
is very, very constrained and has very, very few

55:34.420 --> 55:36.380
free parameters, really, a very small number,

55:36.380 --> 55:38.060
there's a very small number of parameters

55:38.060 --> 55:40.900
and a few integers which tell you what the theory is.

55:40.900 --> 55:42.940
To make this work as a theory of the real world,

55:42.940 --> 55:45.500
you need a Higgs field and you need to,

55:45.500 --> 55:50.080
it needs to do something, and once you introduce

55:50.080 --> 55:54.440
that Higgs field, all sorts of parameters make an appearance.

55:54.440 --> 55:58.760
So now we've got 20 or 30 or whatever parameters

55:58.760 --> 56:00.880
that are gonna tell you what all the masses of things are

56:00.880 --> 56:02.160
and what's gonna happen.

56:02.160 --> 56:05.520
So you've gone from a very tightly constrained thing

56:05.520 --> 56:09.000
with a couple of parameters to this thing,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.800
which the minute you put it in, you had to add

56:11.800 --> 56:14.120
all this extra, all these extra parameters

56:14.120 --> 56:15.320
to make things work.

56:15.320 --> 56:19.120
And so that, it may be one argument as well,

56:19.120 --> 56:20.720
is that just the way the world is

56:20.720 --> 56:24.320
and the fact that you don't find that aesthetically pleasing

56:24.320 --> 56:27.480
is just your problem, or maybe we live in a multiverse

56:27.480 --> 56:30.240
and those numbers are just different in every universe.

56:30.240 --> 56:33.720
But another reasonable conjecture is just that,

56:33.720 --> 56:36.160
well, this is just telling us that there's something

56:36.160 --> 56:40.360
we don't understand about what's going on in a deeper way

56:40.360 --> 56:41.840
which would explain those numbers.

56:41.840 --> 56:44.400
And there's some kind of deeper idea

56:44.400 --> 56:46.040
about where the Higgs field comes from

56:46.040 --> 56:49.080
and what's going on, which we haven't figured out yet.

56:50.040 --> 56:53.440
And that that's what we should look for, but.

56:53.440 --> 56:55.960
Just stick on string theory a little bit longer.

56:55.960 --> 56:57.560
Could you play devil's advocate

56:58.600 --> 57:01.880
and try to argue for string theory,

57:01.880 --> 57:06.880
why it is something that deserved the effort that it got

57:07.000 --> 57:10.400
and still, like if you think of it as a flame,

57:10.400 --> 57:14.160
still should be a little flame that keeps burning.

57:14.160 --> 57:17.760
Well, I think the most positive argument for it

57:17.760 --> 57:22.120
is all sorts of new ideas about mathematics

57:22.120 --> 57:24.800
and about parts of physics really emerged from it.

57:24.800 --> 57:28.440
So it was very a fruitful source of ideas.

57:28.440 --> 57:30.080
And I think this is actually one argument

57:30.080 --> 57:31.640
you'll definitely, which I kind of agree with,

57:31.640 --> 57:34.360
I'll hear from Whitten and from other string theorists

57:34.360 --> 57:39.000
that this is just such a fruitful and inspiring idea

57:39.000 --> 57:41.360
and it's led to so many other different things

57:41.360 --> 57:43.960
coming out of it that there must be something right

57:43.960 --> 57:44.800
about this.

57:45.200 --> 57:48.920
And that's, okay, anyway, I think that that's probably

57:48.920 --> 57:52.800
the strongest thing that they've got.

57:52.800 --> 57:55.840
But you don't think there's aspects to it

57:55.840 --> 58:00.480
that could be neighboring to a theory

58:00.480 --> 58:03.200
that does unify everything, to a theory of everything.

58:03.200 --> 58:06.200
Like it could, it may not be exactly the theory,

58:09.120 --> 58:12.400
but sticking on it longer might get us closer

58:12.400 --> 58:14.400
to the theory of everything.

58:14.480 --> 58:16.080
The problem with it now really is that you really

58:16.080 --> 58:17.320
don't know what it is now.

58:17.320 --> 58:19.880
You've never, nobody has ever kind of come up

58:19.880 --> 58:23.360
with this non-perturbative theory.

58:23.360 --> 58:27.400
So it's become more and more frustrating

58:27.400 --> 58:29.440
and an odd activity to try to argue

58:29.440 --> 58:32.160
with a string theorist about string theory

58:32.160 --> 58:35.240
because it's become less and less well-defined

58:35.240 --> 58:37.240
what it is.

58:37.240 --> 58:40.080
And it's become actually more and more kind of a,

58:40.080 --> 58:42.280
whether you have this weird phenomenon

58:42.320 --> 58:44.760
of people calling themselves string theorists

58:44.760 --> 58:47.480
when they've never actually worked on any theory

58:47.480 --> 58:49.520
where there are any strings anywhere.

58:49.520 --> 58:52.560
So what has actually happened kind of sociologically

58:52.560 --> 58:55.760
is that you started out with this fairly well-defined

58:55.760 --> 58:59.120
proposal and then I would argue because that didn't work,

58:59.120 --> 59:01.720
people branched out in all sorts of directions

59:01.720 --> 59:02.800
doing all sorts of things.

59:02.800 --> 59:05.520
It became farther and farther removed from that.

59:05.520 --> 59:09.320
And for sociological reasons, the ones who kind of

59:09.400 --> 59:14.280
started out or now or were trained by the people

59:14.280 --> 59:18.920
who worked on that have now become this string theorists.

59:18.920 --> 59:23.920
And, but it's becoming almost more kind of

59:23.920 --> 59:25.680
a tribal denominator than a,

59:27.080 --> 59:29.080
so it's very hard to know what you're arguing about

59:29.080 --> 59:30.720
when you're arguing about string theory these days.

59:30.720 --> 59:32.160
Well, to push back on that a little bit,

59:32.160 --> 59:34.600
I mean, string theory, it's just a term, right?

59:34.600 --> 59:37.080
It doesn't, like you could,

59:37.080 --> 59:39.800
like this is the way language evolves,

59:39.800 --> 59:41.640
is it could start to represent something more

59:41.640 --> 59:43.480
than just the theory that involves strings.

59:43.480 --> 59:47.240
It could represent the effort

59:47.240 --> 59:49.600
to unify the laws of physics, right?

59:49.600 --> 59:50.440
Yeah.

59:50.440 --> 59:54.720
At high dimensions with these super tiny objects, right?

59:54.720 --> 59:56.120
Or something like that.

59:56.120 --> 59:59.360
I mean, we can sort of put string theory aside.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.880
So for example, neural networks

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.680
in the space of machine learning,

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.520
there was a time when they were extremely popular,

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.200
they became much, much less popular

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.040
to a point where if you mentioned neural networks,

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.480
you're getting no funding

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.320
and you're not going to be respected at conferences.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:18.320
And then once again, neural networks became all the rage

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.760
about 10, 15 years ago.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.040
And as it goes up and down,

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.840
and a lot of people would argue that using terminology

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.440
like machine learning and deep learning

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:32.440
is often misused over general,

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.200
everything that works is deep learning,

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.960
everything that doesn't isn't, something like that.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.080
You know, that's just the way,

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.920
again, we're back to sociological things,

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.280
but I guess what I'm trying to get at is

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.600
if we leave the sociological mess aside,

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.120
do we throw out the baby with the bath water?

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:57.120
Is there some, besides the side effects of nice ideas

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.200
from the Ed Wittons of the world,

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.200
is there some core truths there that we should stick by

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.240
in the full beautiful mess of a space

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.600
that we call string theory,

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.400
that people call string theory?

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.320
You're right, it is kind of a common problem

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.320
that how what you call some field changes and evolves

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.720
and in interesting ways as the field changes.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.720
But I mean, I guess what I would argue

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.440
is the initial understanding of string theory

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.600
that was quite specific,

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.160
we're talking about a specific idea,

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.880
10 dimensional superstrings compactified in six dimensions,

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.720
that to my mind, the really bad thing

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.160
has happened to the subject is that it's hard to get people

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.120
to admit at least publicly that that was a failure,

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.760
that this really didn't work.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:53.280
And so de facto what people do is people stop doing that

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.440
and they start doing more interesting things,

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.440
but they keep talking to the public about string theory

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.240
and referring back to that idea

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.320
and using that as kind of the starting point

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.320
and as kind of the place where the whole tribe starts

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.960
and everything else comes from.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.880
And so the problem with this is that having

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.480
as your initial name and what everything points back to,

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.480
something which really didn't work out,

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.280
it kind of makes everybody, it makes everything,

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.040
you've created this potentially very, very interesting field

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.080
with interesting things happening,

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:37.080
but people in graduate school take courses on string theory

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.160
and everything kind of, and this is what you tell the public

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.680
in which you're continually pointing back.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.520
So you're continually pointing back to this idea

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:48.520
which never worked out as your guiding inspiration.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.560
And it really kind of deforms your whole way of,

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.120
your hopes of making progress.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.360
And that's, to me, I think the kind of worst thing

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.200
that's happened in this field.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.400
Okay, sure, so there's a lack of transparency

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.680
and sort of authenticity about communicating

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.120
the things that failed in the past.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.920
And so you don't have a clear picture of firm ground

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.080
that you're standing on.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.080
But again, those are sociological things.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:18.720
And there's a bunch of questions I want to ask you.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.160
So one, what's your intuition about

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.640
why the original idea failed?

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.400
So what can you say about why you're pretty sure

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.440
it has failed?

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:35.360
I mean, the initial idea was, as I tried to explain it,

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.320
it was quite seductive in that you could see

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.440
why Witten and others got excited by it.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:44.440
It was, you know, at the time it looked like

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.000
there were only a few of these possible clobby hours

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.680
that would work and it looked like,

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.200
okay, we just have to understand this very specific model

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.080
and these very specific six dimensional spaces

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.720
and we're going to get everything.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.120
And so it was a very seductive idea, but it just,

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:03.000
you know, as people learn, work more and more about it,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
it just didn't, they just kind of realized that

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.280
there are just more and more things you can do

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.200
with these six dimensions and you can't,

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.760
and this is just not going to work.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.840
Meaning like it's, I mean,

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.280
what was the failure mode here?

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.240
Is you could just have an infinite number of possibilities

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.760
you could do so it's, you can come up with any theory

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.360
you want, you can fit quantum mechanics,

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.680
you can explain gravity,

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.840
you can explain anything you want with it.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.240
Is that the basic failure mode?

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:37.120
Yeah, so it's a failure mode of kind of that this idea

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.880
ended up being kind of being essentially empty,

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:41.960
that it just didn't, doesn't,

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.200
ends up not telling you anything

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.280
because it's consistent with just about anything.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.160
And so, I mean, there's a complex,

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.960
if you try and talk with string theorists about this now,

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.400
I mean, there's an argument,

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:56.240
there's a long argument over this about whether,

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.960
you know, oh, no, no, no,

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.560
maybe there still are constraints

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.680
coming out of this idea or not.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.680
Or maybe we live in a multiverse

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.640
and, you know, everything is true anyway.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.240
So you can, there are various ways you can kind of,

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.200
that string theorists have kind of react to this

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.480
kind of argument that I'm making.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.560
Try to hold onto it.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.920
What about experimental validation?

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:23.960
Is that a fair standard to hold

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.560
before a theory of everything

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.000
that's trying to unify quantum mechanics and gravity?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.400
Yeah, I mean, ultimately to be really convinced

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.600
that, you know, that on some new idea

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.720
about unification really works,

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.520
you need some kind of,

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.800
you need to look at the real world

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.960
and see that this is telling you something,

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.240
something true about it.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:48.360
I mean, you know, either telling you

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.720
that if you do some experiment and go out and do it,

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.440
you'll get some unexpected result

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.840
and that's the kind of gold standard,

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.240
or it may be just that,

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.840
like all those numbers that are,

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.040
we don't know how to explain,

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.200
it will show you how to calculate them.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.240
I mean, it can be various kinds of experimental validation,

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:08.640
but that's certainly ideally what you're looking for.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.000
How tough is this, do you think,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.880
for a theory of everything, not just string theory?

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.000
For something that unifies gravity and quantum mechanics,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.560
so the very big and the very small,

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.280
is this, let me ask it one way,

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.280
is it a physics problem, a math problem,

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.960
or an engineering problem?

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.480
My guess is it's a combination of a physics

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.760
and a math problem that you really need.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.920
It's not really engineering.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.560
It's not like there's some kind of well-defined thing

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.240
you can write down and we just don't have enough computer

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.320
power to do the calculation.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.360
That's not the kind of problem it is at all.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.080
But the question is what mathematical tools

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:53.480
you need to properly formulate the problem is unclear.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.000
So one reasonable conjecture is the way,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.800
the reason that we haven't had any success yet

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.640
is just that we're missing,

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:04.280
either we're missing certain physical ideas

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.320
or we're missing certain mathematical tools,

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.480
which are some combination of them,

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.760
which we need to kind of properly formulate the problem

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.760
and see that it has a solution

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.280
that looks like the real world.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.400
But those you need, I guess you don't,

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:24.400
but there's a sense that you need both gravity,

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.360
like all the laws of physics to be operating

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.440
on the same level.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.600
So it feels like you need an object like a black hole

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.600
or something like that in order to make predictions about.

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.400
Otherwise, you're always making predictions

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.760
about this joint phenomena.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.920
Or can you do that as long as the theory is consistent

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.800
and doesn't have special cases for each of the phenomena?

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.560
Well, your theory, I mean,

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.120
if your theory is gonna include gravity,

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.480
our current understanding of gravity

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.680
is that you should have,

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.800
there should be black hole states in it.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.840
You should be able to describe black holes in this theory.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.280
And just one aspect that people concentrate a lot on

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.600
is just this kind of questions about

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.840
if your theory includes black holes like it's supposed to,

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.840
and it includes quantum mechanics,

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.880
then there's certain kind of paradoxes which come up.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.800
And so that's been a huge focus

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.720
of kind of quantum gravity work

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.240
has been just those paradoxes.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.240
So stepping outside of string theory,

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.520
can you just say first at a high level,

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.560
what is a theory of everything?

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.280
What is a theory of everything seek to accomplish?

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.760
Well, I mean, this is very much a kind of reductionist

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.080
point of view in the sense that, so it's not a theory.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.840
This is not gonna explain to you,

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.840
anything, it doesn't really,

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.240
this kind of theory of everything we're talking about

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.320
doesn't say anything interesting,

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.240
particularly about like macroscopic objects

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.320
about what the weather is gonna be tomorrow

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.800
or things are happening at this scale.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.240
But just what we've discovered is that

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.480
as you look at the universe,

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.400
it kind of, if you kind of start breaking,

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.320
you can start breaking it apart into,

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.440
and you end up with some fairly simple pieces,

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.160
quanta, if you like, and which are doing,

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.480
which are interacting in some fairly simple way.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.480
And it's, so what we mean by theory of everything

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.480
is a theory that describes all the correct objects

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.800
you need to describe what's happening in the world

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.160
and describes how they're interacting with each other

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.880
at a most fundamental level.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:35.480
How you get from that theory to describing

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:38.200
some macroscopic, incredibly complicated thing

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.000
is there, that becomes, again,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.160
more of an engineering problem.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.640
And you may need machine learning

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.640
or you may, you know,

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.400
a lot of very different things to do it, but.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.760
Well, I don't even think it's just engineering.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.400
It's also science.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:55.280
One thing that I find kind of interesting,

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.240
talking to physicists is a little bit,

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:07.200
there's a little bit of hubris.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.720
So some of the most brilliant people I know

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.800
are physicists, both philosophy

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.360
and just in terms of mathematics,

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.320
in terms of understanding the world.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.520
But there's a kind of either a hubris

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.080
or what would I call it,

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.760
like a confidence that if we have a theory of everything,

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.560
we will understand everything.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.760
Like, this is the deepest thing to understand.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.840
And I would say, and like the rest is details, right?

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.640
That's the old Rutherford thing.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.960
But to me, there's like, this is like a cake or something.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.160
There's layers to this thing

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.040
and each one has a theory of everything.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.600
Like at every level from biology,

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.680
like how life originates,

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:52.720
that itself, like complex systems.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.840
Like that in itself is like this gigantic thing

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.840
that requires a theory of everything.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:01.680
And then there's the, in the space of humans,

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.720
psychology, like collective intelligence,

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.160
the way it emerges among species.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.240
That feels like a complex system

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.560
that requires its own theory of everything.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.480
On top of that is things like in the computing space,

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.840
artificial intelligence systems,

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.480
like that feels like it needs a theory of everything.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:24.480
And it's almost like once we solve,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.720
once we come up with a theory of everything,

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.520
it explains the basic laws of physics

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.360
that gave us the universe.

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.680
Even stuff that's super complex,

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.160
like how the universe might be able to originate.

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.480
Even explaining something that you're not a big fan of,

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.960
like multiverses or stuff

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.920
that we don't have any evidence of yet.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.640
Still, we won't be able to have a strong explanation

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:52.720
of why food tastes delicious.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.680
Oh yeah, I know.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.600
No, anyway, yeah, I agree completely.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.720
I mean, there is something kind of completely wrong

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.880
with this terminology of theory of everything.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.280
It's not, it's really in some sense,

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:06.440
very bad term, very heuristic and bad terminology,

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.080
because it's not, this is explaining,

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.160
this is a purely kind of reductionist point of view

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.280
that you're trying to understand

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.920
certain very specific kind of things,

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.920
which in principle, other things emerge from,

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.640
but to actually understand how anything emerges from this

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.720
is, it can't be understood in terms of

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.680
this underlying fund wealth theory is gonna be hopeless

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.640
in terms of kind of telling you what,

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.920
about this various emergent behavior.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.040
And as you go to different levels of explanation,

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:45.040
you're gonna need to develop different,

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.080
completely different ideas,

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.320
completely different ways of thinking.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:52.320
And I guess there's a famous kind of Phil Anderson's slogan

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:55.080
is that, you know, more is different than the,

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:59.240
so, and it's just, yeah, even once you understand how,

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.520
what a couple of things,

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.880
if you have a collection of stuff

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.160
and you understand perfectly well

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.240
how each thing is interacting with it,

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.560
with the others, what the whole thing is gonna do

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.120
is just a completely different problem.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.240
It's just not, and you need completely different ways

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.480
of thinking about it.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.400
What do you think about this?

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.400
I gotta ask you at a few different attempts

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.040
at a theory of everything, especially recently.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.240
So I've been, for many years,

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.600
a big fan of cellular automata of complex systems.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.120
And obviously, because of that,

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.480
a fan of Stephen Wolfram's work in that space.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:35.160
But he's recently been talking about a theory of everything

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.080
through his physics project, essentially.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.360
What do you think about this kind of discreet

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:45.120
theory of everything, like from simple rules

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.640
and simple objects on the hypergraphs

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.360
emerges all of our reality,

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.480
our time and space are emergent.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.960
Basically everything we see around us is emergent.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:55.440
Yeah, I have to say, unfortunately,

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.440
I have kind of pretty much zero sympathy for that.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.680
I mean, I don't, I spent a little time looking at it

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.960
and I just don't see, it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.760
And it really is, just really, really doesn't agree at all

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.920
with what I'm seeing,

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.200
this kind of unification of math and physics

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.440
that I'm kind of talking about

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.720
around certain kinds of very deep ideas

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.880
about geometry and stuff.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.480
If you wanna believe that your things are really coming out

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.760
of cellular automata at the most fundamental level,

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:30.440
you have to believe that everything that I've seen

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:34.280
my whole career and as beautiful, powerful ideas,

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.680
that that's all just kind of a mirage,

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.160
which just kind of randomly is emerging

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:41.440
from these more basic, very, very simple minded things.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.920
And you have to give me some serious evidence for that

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.200
and I'm saying nothing.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:50.440
So mirage, you don't think there could be a consistency

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:54.480
where things like quantum mechanics could emerge

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:57.560
from much, much, much smaller, discrete

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.120
like computational type systems.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.280
I think from the point of view

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.280
of certain mathematical point of view,

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.400
quantum mechanics is already mathematically

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400
as simple as it gets.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:12.400
It really is a story about really the fundamental objects

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.640
that you work with

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.440
when you write down a quantum theory

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.480
are in some form point of view,

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.160
precisely the fundamental objects

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:22.880
at the deepest levels of mathematics

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.080
that you're working with, they're exactly the same.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.480
So, and cellular automata are something completely different

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.000
which don't fit into these structures.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.920
And so I just don't see why.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.920
Anyway, I don't see it as a promising thing to do.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.600
And then just looking at it and seeing,

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.480
does this go anywhere?

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.440
Does this solve any problem that I've ever,

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.520
that I didn't, does this solve any problem

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.760
of any kind, I just don't see it.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.600
Yeah, to me cellular automata and these hypergraphs,

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.280
I'm not sure solving a problem is even the standard

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.680
to apply here at this moment.

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.600
To me, the fascinating thing is that the question it asks

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.000
have no good answers.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.560
So there's not good math explaining,

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.040
forget the physics of it,

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.200
math explaining the behavior of complex systems.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.320
And that to me is both exciting and paralyzing.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.400
Like we're at the very early days of understanding

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.000
how complicated and fascinating things emerge

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.280
from simple rules.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.960
Yeah, I agree.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.440
I think that is a truly great problem.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.120
And depending where it goes, it may be,

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.600
it may start to develop some kind of connections

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:36.720
to the things that I've kind of found more fruitful

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.800
and hard to know.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.720
I think a lot of that area, I kind of strongly feel

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.760
I best not say too much about it

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.200
because I just, I don't know too much about it.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.600
And again, we're back to this original problem

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.320
that your time in life is limited.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.760
You have to figure out what you're gonna spend

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.840
your time thinking about.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.040
And that's something I just never seen enough

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.480
to convince me to spend more time thinking about.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.960
Well, also timing, it's not just that our time is limited,

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.200
but the timing of the kind of things you think about,

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.760
there's some aspect to cellular automata,

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.880
these kinds of objects that it feels like

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.880
we're very many years away from having big breakthroughs on.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.480
And so it's like, you have to pick the problems

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.840
that are solvable today.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.440
In fact, my intuition, again, perhaps biased

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:30.240
is it feels like the kind of systems that,

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.880
complex systems that cellular automata are

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.160
would not be solved by human brains.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.360
It feels like, well, like it feels like something

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.880
post-human that will solve that problem

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.040
or like significantly enhanced humans,

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.720
meaning like using computational tools,

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.960
very powerful computational tools

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.160
to crack these problems open.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:58.160
That's if our approach to science,

01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.960
our ability to understand science,

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:01.640
our ability to understand physics

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.560
will become more and more computational

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.320
or there'll be a whole field that's computational nature,

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.720
which currently is not the case.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.520
Currently, computation is the thing that sort of assists us

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.680
in understanding science

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.760
the way we've been doing it all along.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.000
But if there's a whole new,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.560
I mean, we're from new kind of science, right?

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:22.240
It's a little bit dramatic.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:27.240
But if computers could do science

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.120
on their own computational systems,

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.600
perhaps that's the way they would do the science.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.760
They would try to understand the cellular automata

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.000
and that feels like we're decades away.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.960
So perhaps it'll crack open some interesting facets

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.320
of this physics problem, but it's very far away.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.680
So timing is everything.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.040
That's perfectly possible, yeah.

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.640
Well, let me ask you then in the space of geometry,

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.560
I don't know how well you know Eric Weinstein.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.400
Quite well, yeah.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.520
What are your thoughts about his geometric unity

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.720
and the space of ideas that he's playing with

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.720
in his proposal for theory of everything?

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:14.080
Well, I think that he fundamentally has,

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.240
I think the same problems

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.640
that everybody has had trying to do this.

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.600
And they're really versions of the same problem

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.080
that you try to get unity

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.800
by putting everything into some bigger structure.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.440
So he has some other ones that are not so conventional

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.000
that he's trying to work with.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
But he has the same problem that even if he can get

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.720
a lot farther in terms of having a really well-defined,

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.880
well-understood, clear picture of these things

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.200
he's working with, they're really kind of large

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.120
geometrical structures with many dimensions, many kinds.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.400
And I just don't see any way

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.520
he's gonna have the same problem the string theorists have.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.680
How do you get back down to the structures

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.040
of the standard model?

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.880
And how do you, yeah.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.760
So I just, anyway, it's the same.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.320
And there's another interesting example

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.560
of a similar kind of thing is Garrett Lisey's

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.400
theory of everything.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.600
Again, it's a little bit more specific than Eric's.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.560
He's working with this E8.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:26.000
But it, again, I think all these things found

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.800
are at the same point that you don't,

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:32.680
you create this unity, but then you have no,

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.960
you don't actually have a good idea

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.920
how you're gonna get back to the actual,

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.120
to the objects we've seen.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.960
How are you gonna, you create these big symmetries,

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.400
how are you gonna break them?

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.560
And because we don't see those symmetries

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.120
in the real world.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:53.880
So ultimately, there would need to be a simple process

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.320
for collapsing it to four dimensions.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.000
You'd have to explain, well, yeah,

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.040
and I forget in his case, but it's not just four dimensions.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:05.440
It's also these structures you see in the standard model.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:09.080
There's certain very small dimensional groups of symmetry.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.400
It's all called U1, SU2, and SU3.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.600
And the problem with, and this has been a problem

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.920
since the beginning, almost immediately after 1973,

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.440
about a year later, two years later,

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.160
people started talking about grand unified theories.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.160
So you take the U1, the SU2, and the SU3,

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.280
and you put them together into this bigger structure

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.560
called the SU5 or SO10.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.560
But then you're stuck with this problem that,

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.440
wait a minute, now how, why does the world not look,

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:41.000
why do I not see these SU5 symmetries in the world?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.520
I only see these.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.240
And so, and I think those,

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.920
the kind of thing that Eric and also Garrett

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.000
and lots of people would try to do,

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.200
they all kind of found her in that same way

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.680
that they don't have a good answer to that.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:01.320
Are there lessons, ideas to be learned

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.320
from theories like that, from Garrett Leasy's, from Eric's?

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:06.240
I don't know, it depends.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:11.080
I have to confess, I haven't looked that closely at Eric's.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:14.280
I mean, he explained to this to me personally a few times,

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.440
and I've looked a bit at his paper,

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.240
but it's, again, we're back to the problem

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.240
of a limited amount of time in life.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.720
Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting effect, right?

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.800
Why don't more physicists look at it?

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.920
I mean, I'm in this position that somehow,

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.920
you know, people write me emails for whatever reason,

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:47.480
and I work in the space of AI,

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.160
and so there's a lot of people,

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.320
perhaps AI is even way more accessible than physics

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.960
in a certain sense, and so a lot of people write to me

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.720
with different theories about they have

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.000
for how to create general intelligence.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.400
And it's, again, a little bit of an excuse I say to myself,

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.440
like, well, I only have a limited amount of time,

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:07.920
so that's why I'm not investigating it.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:11.640
But I wonder if there's ideas out there

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.600
that are still powerful, they're still fascinating,

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:19.600
and that I'm missing because I'm dismissing them

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:24.720
because they're outside of the sort of the usual process

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.800
of academic research.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.360
Yeah, well, I mean, the same thing pretty much every day

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.680
in my email, there's somebody who's got a theory

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:35.520
or everything about why all of what physicists are doing.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:38.960
Perhaps the most disturbing thing I should say

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.760
about my being a critic of string theory

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.760
is that when you realize who your fans are,

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:47.080
that every day I hear from somebody who says,

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:48.680
oh, well, since you don't like string theory,

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.000
you must, of course, agree with me

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.280
that this is the right way to think about everything.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.000
Oh, no, oh, no.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.520
And, you know, most of these are, you quickly can see,

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.840
this person doesn't know very much

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.280
and doesn't know what they're doing,

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:05.400
but there's a whole continuum to people

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.040
who are quite serious physicists and mathematicians

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.360
who are making a fairly serious attempt

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:14.600
to try to do something, like Gert and Eric,

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.040
and then your problem is, you know,

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.320
you spend, you do want to try to spend more time

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.560
looking at it and try to figure out

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.640
what they're really doing, but then at some point,

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.920
you just realize, wait a minute,

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.600
for me to really, really understand exactly

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.560
what's going on here would just take time I just don't have.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:34.640
Yeah, it takes a long time,

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.960
which is the nice thing about AI,

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.120
is unlike the kind of physics we're talking about,

01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.120
if your idea is good, that should quite naturally lead

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.800
to you being able to build a system that's intelligent.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.280
So you don't need to get approval

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:54.480
from somebody that's saying you have a good idea here.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.920
You can just utilize that idea and engineer a system,

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.880
like naturally leads to engineering.

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.000
With physics here, if you have a perfect theory

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.080
that explains everything, that still doesn't obviously lead,

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:11.080
one, to scientific experiments that can validate that theory

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:16.400
and two, to like trinkets you can build and sell

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.600
at a store for $5.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.120
You can't make money off of it.

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.680
So that makes it much more challenging.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.520
Yeah.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.560
Well, let me also ask you about something that you found,

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.520
especially recently appealing,

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.800
which is Roger Penrose's Twister Theory.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.160
What is it?

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.800
What kind of questions might it allow us to answer?

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.880
What will the answers look like?

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.600
It's only in the last couple of years

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.360
that I really, really kind of come to really,

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.040
I think to appreciate it and to see how to really,

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.480
I believe to see how to really do something with it.

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:51.200
And I've gotten very excited about that the last year or two.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.800
I mean, one way of saying one idea of Twister Theory

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.040
is that it's a different way of thinking about

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.800
what space and time are

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.240
and about what points in space and time are,

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.080
but which is very interesting

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.400
that it only really works in four dimensions.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.720
So four dimensions behaves very, very specially

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:11.200
unlike other dimensions.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.440
And in four dimensions, there's certain,

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:16.560
there is a way of thinking about space and time geometry

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.680
where, as well as just thinking about points

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.280
in space and time,

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.160
you can also think about different objects,

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:26.240
these so-called twisters.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:27.880
And then when you do that,

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.920
you end up with a kind of a really interesting insight

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:35.320
that you can formulate a theory

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:38.400
and you can formulate a very, take a standard theory

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.680
that we formulate in terms of points of space and time,

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.440
and you can reformulate in this twister language.

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:45.880
And in this twister language,

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:50.480
it's the fundamental objects actually are more kind of the,

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.160
are actually spheres in some sense, kind of the light cone.

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.120
So maybe one way to say it,

01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:59.240
which actually I think is really,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.280
is quite amazing is if you ask yourself,

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:05.200
what do we know about the world?

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.760
We have this idea that the world out there is this,

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:11.400
all these different points and these points of time.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.240
Well, that's kind of a derived quantity.

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.560
What we really know about the world

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.520
is when we open our eyes, what do you see?

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.600
You see a sphere.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:22.200
And that what you're looking at is you're looking at,

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.480
a sphere is worth a light rays coming into your eyes.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:29.160
And what Penrose says is that,

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:33.840
well, what a point in space time is, is that sphere,

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.640
that sphere of all the light rays coming in.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.200
And he says, and you should formulate your,

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.760
instead of thinking about points,

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.120
you should think about the space of those spheres

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:43.960
if you like.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.320
Formulate the degrees of freedom as physics

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.040
as living on those spheres, living on,

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.960
so you're kind of living on,

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.680
your degrees of freedom are living on light rays,

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.240
not on points.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.240
And it's a very different way of thinking about physics.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.800
And he and others working with him

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.800
developed a beautiful mathematical formalism

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.880
and a way to go back and forth

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.800
between some aspects of our standard way

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.280
we write these things down.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.400
And work on the so-called twister space.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.400
And, you know, certain things worked out very well,

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.640
but they ended up, you know,

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.960
I think kind of stuck by the eighties or nineties

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.960
that they weren't a little bit like string theory

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.240
that they, by using these ideas about twisters,

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.080
they could develop them in different directions

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.800
and find all sorts of other interesting things.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.920
But they were getting,

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.600
they weren't finding any way of doing that,

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:43.160
that brought them back to kind of new insights into physics.

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.520
And my own, I mean, what's kind of gotten me excited really

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:49.800
is what I think I have an idea about

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.640
that I think does actually work

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.240
that goes more in that direction.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.800
And I can go on about that endlessly

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.280
or tell you a little bit about it, but that's the,

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.240
I think that that's the one kind of easy to explain

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.280
insight about twister theory.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.920
There are some more technical ones.

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:09.400
I should mean, I think it's also very convincing

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.320
what it tells you about spinners, for instance,

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.000
but that's a more technical.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.040
Well, first let's like linger on the spheres

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.160
and the light cones.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.600
You're saying twister theory allows you

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.360
to make that the fundamental object

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.760
with which you're operating.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.680
Yeah.

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:27.400
How that, I mean, first of all, like philosophically,

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.880
that's weird and beautiful,

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.560
maybe because it maps,

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.040
it feels like it moves us so much closer

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.800
to the way human brains perceive reality.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.800
So it's almost like our perception is,

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:51.520
like the content of our perception

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.560
is the fundamental object of reality.

01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.920
That's very appealing.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.240
Yeah.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.640
Is it mathematically powerful?

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:04.720
Is there something you can say,

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.840
can you say a little bit more

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.400
about what the heck that even means for,

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:11.280
because it's much easier to think about mathematically

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.760
like a point in space-time.

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:16.920
What does it mean to be operating on the light cone?

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.400
It uses a kind of mathematics that's relative,

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.200
that, you know, what was kind of goes back

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.040
to the 19th century among mathematicians.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.440
It's not, anyway, it's a bit of a long story,

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.880
but one problem is that you have to start,

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.760
it's crucial that you think in terms of complex numbers

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:32.920
and not just real numbers.

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:36.360
And this, for most people, that makes it harder to,

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.640
for mathematicians, that's fine.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:38.480
We love doing that.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.880
But for most people, that makes it harder to think about.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:44.680
But I think perhaps the most, the way that there is

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.880
something you can say very specifically about it,

01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.120
you know, in terms of spinors,

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.080
which I don't know if you want to,

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.800
I think at some point you want to talk.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:52.640
So maybe-

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.480
What are spinors?

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:54.320
Let's start with spinner,

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.040
because I think that if we can introduce that,

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.320
then I can say-

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:01.040
By the way, twister is spelled with an O,

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.760
and spinner is spelled with an O as well.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.280
Yes, okay.

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.720
In case you want to Google it and look it up,

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:10.960
there's very nice Wikipedia pages as a starting point.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:13.560
I don't know what is a good starting point for twister three.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:16.120
Well, one thing to say about Penrose,

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.160
I mean, Penrose is actually a very good writer

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.440
and also a very good draftsman.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.080
He's a draftsman, to the extent this is visualizable,

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:23.720
he actually has done some very nice drawings.

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:26.520
So, I mean, almost any kind of expository thing

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.880
you can find him writing is a very good place to start.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.600
He's a remarkable person.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.080
But the, so spinners are something

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.400
that independently came out of mathematics

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.120
and out of physics.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.640
And to say where they came out of physics,

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:44.680
I mean, what people realized when they started looking

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:47.600
at elementary particles like electrons or whatever,

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:51.680
that there seemed to be some kind of doubling

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.160
of the degrees of freedom going on.

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.120
If you counted what was there in some sense

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.200
in the way you would expect it.

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.080
And when you started doing quantum mechanics

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.800
and started looking at elementary particles,

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:03.720
there were seen to be two degrees of freedom.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.920
They're not one.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.880
And one way of seeing it was that if you,

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:11.920
if you put your electron in a strong magnetic field

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.120
and ask what was the energy of it,

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.760
instead of it having one energy, it would have two energies.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:17.920
There'd be two energy levels.

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.480
And as you increase magnetic field,

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:22.080
the splitting would increase.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.960
So, physicists kind of realized that, wait a minute.

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.000
So we thought when we were doing it,

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.200
first started doing quantum mechanics,

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.080
that the way to describe particles

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.560
was in terms of wave functions.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:35.840
And these wave functions were complex to complex values.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.080
Well, if we actually look at particles,

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:38.920
that's not right.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.320
They're pairs of complex numbers.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:44.080
They're pairs of complex numbers.

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.920
So, you know, why, so one of the kind of fundamental,

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.040
from the physics point of view, the fundamental question is,

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.720
why are all our kind of fundamental particles

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.760
described by pairs of complex numbers?

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:56.600
Just weird.

01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:59.400
And then, but if you go, and then you can ask, you know,

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.560
well, what happens if you, like,

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.160
take an electron and rotate it?

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:08.160
So how do things move in this pair of complex numbers?

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.920
Well, now, if you go back to mathematics,

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:13.840
what had been understood in mathematics, you know,

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.360
some years earlier, not that many years earlier,

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.440
was that if you ask very, very generally,

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:24.240
think about geometry of three dimensions and ask,

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.800
and if you think about things that are happening

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.240
in three dimensions in the standard way,

01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:30.480
everything, the standard way of doing geometry,

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.520
everything is about vectors, right?

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.160
So if you've taken any mathematics classes,

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:36.680
you'll probably see vectors at some point.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:39.400
They're just triplets of numbers tell you

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:41.600
what a direction is or how far you're going

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.840
in three-dimensional space.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:46.240
And most of everything we teach in most standard courses

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.680
in mathematics is about vectors

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:51.400
and things you build out of vectors.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.040
So you express everything about geometry

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.400
in terms of vectors or how they're changing

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.560
or how you put two of them together

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.920
and get planes and whatever.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.880
But what had been realized right on

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.800
is that if you ask very, very generally,

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.800
what are the things that you can kind of consistently

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
think about rotating?

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.320
And so you ask a technical question,

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.600
what are the representations of the rotation group?

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:22.200
Well, you find that one answer is there are vectors

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:24.640
and everything you build out of vectors.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.400
But then people found, but wait a minute,

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.240
there's also these other things

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.800
which you can't build out of vectors,

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.400
but which you can consistently rotate.

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:37.040
And they're described by pairs of complex numbers,

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.440
by two complex numbers.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.560
And they're the spinors also.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.080
And you can think of spinors in some sense

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.640
as more fundamental than vectors

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.840
because you can build vectors out of spinors.

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:51.160
You can take two spinors and make a vector,

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.160
but if you only have vectors, you can't get spinors.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:00.160
So there in some sense, there's some kind of lower level

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.200
of geometry beyond what we thought it was,

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.320
which was kind of spinner geometry.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.400
And this is something which even to this day,

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:09.480
when we teach graduate courses in geometry,

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.760
we mostly don't talk about this

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:15.440
because it's a bit hard to do correctly.

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:18.920
If you start with your whole setup as in terms of vectors,

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.040
describing things in terms of spinors

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:24.040
is a whole different ball game.

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.800
But anyway, it was just this amazing fact

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:33.040
that this kind of more fundamental piece of geometry,

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.480
spinors and what we were actually seeing,

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.920
if you look at electron are one and the same.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:41.360
So I think it's kind of a mind blowing thing,

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.920
but it's very uncounterintuitive.

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:47.040
What are some weird properties of spinors

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:50.240
that are counterintuitive?

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.560
That there are some things that they do,

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:56.280
if you rotate a spinner around 360 degrees,

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.240
it doesn't come back towards,

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:00.040
it becomes minus what it was.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:04.640
Anyway, so the way rotations work,

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:05.920
there's a kind of a funny sign

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.200
you have to keep track of in some sense.

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:11.040
So they're kind of too valued in another weird way.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.720
But the fundamental problem is that it's just not,

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.400
if you're used to visualizing vectors,

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:19.600
there's nothing you can do,

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:20.560
visualize in terms of vectors

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.880
that will ever give you a spinner,

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.880
it just is not gonna ever work.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:26.640
As you were saying that I was visualizing a vector

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.120
walking along a Mobius strip,

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.920
and it ends up being upside down.

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.840
But you're saying that doesn't really capture.

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.880
So I mean, what really captures it,

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.560
the problem is that it's really,

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.200
the simplest way to describe it

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:43.440
is in terms of two complex numbers.

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.120
And your problem with two complex numbers

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.880
is that's four real numbers.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:50.560
So your spinner kind of lies in a four dimensional space,

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.840
so that makes it hard to visualize.

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:57.560
And it's crucial that it's not just any four dimensions,

01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.360
it's actually complex numbers.

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.760
You're really gonna use the fact

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.200
that these are two complex numbers.

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.200
So it's very hard to visualize.

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.320
But to get back to what I think is mind blowing

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:14.040
about twisters is that another way of saying this idea

01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:15.800
about talking about spheres,

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.360
another way of saying the fundamental idea

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.480
of twister theory is,

01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:21.560
in some sense the fundamental idea of twister theory

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:26.560
is that a point is a two complex dimensional space,

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:32.040
so that every, and that it lives inside,

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.560
the space that it lies inside is twister space.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.600
So in the simplest case,

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.520
it's twister space is four dimensional,

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:43.040
and a point in space time is a two complex dimensional

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:47.440
subspace of all the four complex dimensions.

01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.960
And as you move around in space time,

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.560
you're just moving, your planes are just moving around.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.400
Okay.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.760
And that, but then the-

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.960
So it's a plane in a four dimensional space.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.600
It's a plane-

01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.440
Complex.

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.480
Complex plane, so it's two complex dimensions

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:03.040
in four complex dimensions.

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:03.880
Okay.

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:05.760
But then to me the mind blowing thing about this

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:09.360
is this then kind of tautologically answers the question

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360
is what is a spinner?

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.080
Well, a spinner is a point.

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.920
I mean, the space of spinners at a point is the point.

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:21.520
In twister theory, the points are the complex two planes,

01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:24.640
and you want me to, and you're asking what a spinner is.

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.280
Well, a spinner, the space of spinners is that two plane.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.800
So it's, you know, just your whole definition

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:33.400
of what a point in space time was

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.200
just told you what a spinner was.

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.240
It's, they're just, it's the same thing.

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.480
Yeah, but we're trying to project that

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.760
into a three dimensional space

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:42.280
and trying to intuit when you can't.

01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.120
Yeah, so the intuition becomes very difficult,

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:49.120
but from, if you don't, not using twister theory,

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:51.280
you have to kind of go through a certain

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:54.600
fairly complicated rigmarole to even describe spinners,

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.000
to describe electrons.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.200
Whereas using twister theory,

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.800
it's just completely tautological.

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03.720
They're just, what you want to describe the electron

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.840
is fundamentally the way that you're describing

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.480
the point in space time already, it's just there.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.280
Do you have a hope, you mentioned that you've been,

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.920
you found it appealing recently.

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.240
Is it just because of certain aspects

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.640
of its mathematical beauty, or do you actually have a hope

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:22.600
that this might lead to a theory of everything?

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.120
Yeah, I mean, I certainly do have such a hope

01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:27.160
because what I've found, I think the thing

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.040
which I've done, which I don't think,

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.560
as far as I can tell, no one had really looked at

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:34.200
from this point of view before is,

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:39.000
has to do with this question of how do you treat time

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.840
in your quantum theory.

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:44.440
And so there's another long story

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.680
about how we do quantum theories

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.720
and about how we treat time in quantum theories,

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.760
which is a long story.

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:55.600
But the short version of it is that what people have found

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.440
when you try and write down a quantum theory,

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:03.440
that it's often a good idea to take your time coordinate,

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.120
whatever you're using to your time coordinate

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.960
and multiply it by the square root of minus one

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:12.000
and to make it purely imaginary.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.480
And so all these formulas which you have

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.920
in your standard theory, if you do that to those,

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:23.640
I mean, those formulas have some very strange behavior

01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:25.400
and they're kind of singular.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.800
If you ask even some simple questions,

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.000
you have to take very delicate singular limits

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.280
in order to get the correct answer,

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.040
and you have to take them from the right direction,

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.960
otherwise it doesn't work.

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:39.640
Whereas if you just take time

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:42.120
and if you just put a factor of square root of minus one

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.240
wherever you see the time coordinate,

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:47.360
you end up with much simpler formulas

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.920
which are much better behaved mathematically.

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.880
And what I hadn't really appreciated until fairly recently

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.480
is also how dramatically that changes

01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.240
the whole structure of the theory.

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.800
You end up with a consistent way of talking

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.600
about these quantum theories,

01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:04.280
but it has some very different flavor

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:05.200
and very different aspects

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.400
that I hadn't really appreciated.

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:10.880
And in particular, the way symmetries act on it

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.040
is not at all what I originally had expected.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.640
And so that's the new thing that I have

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.840
or I think gives you something is to do this move

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:26.360
which people often think of as just kind of a mathematical

01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.640
trick that you're doing to make some formulas

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:31.480
work out nicely, but to take that mathematical trick

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.200
as really fundamental.

01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:35.960
And it turns out in twister theory

01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:39.520
allows you to simultaneously talk about your usual time

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.920
and the time times the square root of minus one.

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:45.520
They both fit very nicely into twister theory.

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.360
And you end up with some structures

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.560
which look a lot like the standard models.

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.160
Well, let me ask you about some Nobel prizes.

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.320
Okay.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.600
Do you think there will be,

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:03.160
there was a bet between Michio Kaku and somebody else.

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.040
John Horgan.

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.760
John Horgan about, by the way,

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:11.160
maybe discover a cool website, longbets.com or .org.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:13.000
It's cool.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.160
It's cool that you can make a bet with people

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.360
and then check in 20 years later.

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.480
That's, I really love it.

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:21.280
There's a lot of interesting bets on there.

01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:24.000
I would love to participate, but it's interesting to see,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.440
time flies and you make a bet about

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.880
what's going to happen in 20 years.

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:31.040
You don't realize 20 years just goes like this.

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:31.880
Yeah.

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.680
And then, and then you get to face,

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.160
and you get to wonder like,

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:41.040
what was that person, what was I thinking?

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.840
That person 20 years ago is almost like a different person.

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:47.200
What was I thinking back then to think that is interesting.

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.600
But, so let me ask you this on record.

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:54.000
20 years from now or some number of years from now,

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.920
do you think there will be a Nobel prize given for

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:59.040
something directly connected to a

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.720
first broadly theory of everything?

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.000
And second, of course, one of the possibilities,

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.280
one of them, string theory.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.400
String theory is definitely not that things have gone.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:16.200
Yeah.

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:18.160
So if you were giving financial advice,

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.160
you would say not to bet on it.

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.360
No, do not bet on it.

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.560
And even, I actually suspect if you ask string theory

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:27.520
is that question, you're going to get few of them saying,

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.600
I mean, if you'd asked them that question 20 years ago,

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:32.160
again, when Kaku was making this bet or whatever,

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:34.480
I think some of them would have taken you up on it.

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:37.000
But, and certainly back in 1984,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
a bunch of them would have said, oh, sure, yeah.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.040
But now I get the impression that they've,

01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.680
even they realize that things are not looking good

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:46.880
for that particular idea.

01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:48.640
Again, it depends what you mean by string theory,

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:51.920
whether maybe the term will evolve to mean something else,

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.800
which will work out.

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:57.400
But yeah, I don't think that's not gonna like it to work out

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.040
whether something else,

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.200
I still think it's relatively unlikely

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:04.920
that you'll have any really successful theory or anything.

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.400
And the main problem is just the,

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:11.080
it's become so difficult to do experiments

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:13.560
at higher energy that we've really lost this ability

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:18.560
to kind of get unexpected input from experiment.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:22.200
And you can, while it's maybe hard to figure out

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.880
what people's thinking is gonna be 20 years from now,

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:28.760
looking at high energy particle,

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.920
high energy colliders and their technology,

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.560
it's actually pretty easy to make a pretty accurate guess

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.520
what it's gonna, what you're gonna be doing

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:37.360
20 years from now.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:42.360
And I think actually, I would actually claim that

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.520
it's pretty clear where you're gonna be 20 years from now.

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.920
And what it's gonna be is you're gonna have the,

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.040
you're gonna have the LHC,

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:51.520
you're gonna have a lot more data

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:56.120
and order of magnitude or more data from the LHC,

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:57.600
but at the same energy,

01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:01.960
you're not gonna see a higher energy accelerator

01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:05.360
operating successfully in the next 20 years.

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:08.160
And like maybe machine learning

01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:10.280
or great sort of data science methodologies

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:14.800
that process that data will not reveal any major

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.400
like shifts in our understanding

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.200
of the underlying physics, do you think?

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.040
I don't think so.

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:23.080
I think that feel that my understanding

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.280
is that they're starting to make a great use

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.160
of those techniques, but it seems to look like

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:31.040
it will help them solve certain technical problems

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.560
and be able to do things somewhat better,

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.640
but not completely change the way they're looking at things.

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:39.600
What do you think about the potential quantum computers

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.320
simulating quantum mechanical systems

01:45:41.320 --> 01:45:46.320
and through that sneak up to sort of through simulation,

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.280
sneak up to a deep understanding

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.520
of the fundamental physics?

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.760
The problem there is that that's promising more

01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:59.360
for this, for Phil Anderson's problem,

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:02.960
that if you wanna, there's lots and lots of,

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:07.960
if you take, you start putting together lots

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.520
and lots of things and we think we know

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.040
they're pair by pair interactions,

01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.360
but what this thing is gonna do,

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.520
we don't have any good calculational techniques.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:19.520
Quantum computers may very well give you those

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:21.960
and so they may, what we think of as kind of

01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:25.200
strong coupling behavior, we have no good way to calculate.

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.280
Even though we can write down the theory,

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:30.640
we don't know how to calculate anything

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:33.640
with any accuracy and that the quantum computers

01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:36.080
may solve that problem, but the problem is that they,

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.160
I don't think that they're gonna solve the problem,

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:41.480
that they help you with the problem of not having the,

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:44.240
of knowing what the right underlying theory is.

01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:48.560
As somebody who likes experimental validation,

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:51.320
let me ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding,

01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:54.560
but I don't think it's actually a ridiculous question of,

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:56.720
do you think we live in a simulation?

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:58.360
Do you find that thought experiment

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.200
at all useful or interesting?

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.640
Not really, not really, I don't, it just doesn't,

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.720
yeah, anyway, to me, it doesn't actually lead

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:12.000
to any kind of interesting, lead anywhere interesting.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.560
Yeah, to me, so maybe I'll throw a wrench into your thing.

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:19.640
To me, it's super interesting from an engineering perspective.

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.880
So if you look at virtual reality systems,

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:28.160
the actual question is, how much computation

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:33.000
and how difficult is it to construct a world

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.800
that, like there are several levels here.

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.720
One is you won't know the different,

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.360
our human perception systems

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.720
and maybe even the tools of physics

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.920
won't know the difference between the simulated world

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:45.880
and the real world.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:51.000
That's sort of more of a physics question.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.040
The most interesting question to me

01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.720
has more to do with why food tastes delicious,

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:58.680
which is create how difficult

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.360
and how much computation is required

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.840
to construct a simulation

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:06.080
where you kind of know it's a simulation at first,

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:07.800
but you want to stay there anyway.

01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:12.800
And over time, you don't even remember.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.840
Yeah, well, anyway, I agree.

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.320
These are kind of fascinating questions

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.000
and they may be very, very relevant

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.880
to our future as a species,

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:24.640
but yeah, they're just very far from anything.

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.040
I...

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:27.560
Well, so from a physics perspective,

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.360
it's not useful to you to think,

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.320
taking a computational perspective to our universe,

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:35.120
thinking of it as an information processing system

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.400
and then to give it as doing computation

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.760
and then you think about the resources required

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:42.520
to do that kind of computation and all that kind of stuff.

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:44.080
You could just look at the basic physics

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.960
and who cares what the computer it's running on is.

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:48.280
Yeah, it just, I mean, the kinds of it,

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:50.200
I mean, I'm willing to agree

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.040
that you can get into interesting kinds of questions

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:53.000
going down that road,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.400
but they're just so different from anything,

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.600
from what I've found interesting that I just,

01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.480
again, I just have to kind of go back to life is too short

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.920
and I'm very glad other people are thinking about this,

01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.480
I just don't see any anything I can do with it.

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:11.440
What about space itself?

01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.160
So I have to ask you about aliens.

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.640
Again, something, since you emphasize evidence,

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.800
do you think there is how many,

01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:22.960
do you think there are and how many

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:25.800
intelligent alien civilizations are out there?

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.520
Yeah, I have no idea, but I have certainly,

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:30.640
as far as I know, unless the government's covering it up

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.960
or something, we haven't heard from,

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.760
we don't have any evidence for such things yet,

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:37.560
but there seems to be no,

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:41.040
there's no particular obstruction,

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.200
why there shouldn't be, so.

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:47.480
I mean, do you, you work on some fundamental questions

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.160
about the physics of reality.

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:51.600
When you look up to the stars,

01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.240
do you think about whether somebody's looking back at us?

01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:58.120
Yes, actually, I originally got interested in physics.

01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.200
I actually started out as a kid interested in astronomy,

01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.280
exactly that, and a telescope and whatever that,

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.600
and certainly read a lot of science fiction

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:08.320
and thought about that.

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:12.000
I find over the years, I find myself kind of less,

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.080
anyway, less and less interested in that,

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.080
just because I don't really know what to do with them.

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:20.400
I've also kind of, at some point,

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.040
kind of stopped reading science fiction that much,

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.080
kind of feeling that there's just too,

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.080
that the actual science I was kind of learning about

01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:29.880
was perfectly kind of weird and fascinating

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:33.160
and unusual enough and better than any of the stuff

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:36.600
that Isaac Asimov, so why shouldn't I?

01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:39.760
Yeah, and you can mess with the science

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:42.280
much more than the distant science fiction,

01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:45.400
the one that exists in our imagination

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.320
or the one that exists out there among the stars.

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.200
Well, you mentioned science fiction.

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:54.080
You've written quite a few book reviews.

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:56.440
I gotta ask you about some books, perhaps,

01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:01.280
if you don't mind, is there one or two books

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.560
that you would recommend to others,

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:07.080
and maybe if you can, what ideas you drew from them?

01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:12.840
Either negative recommendations or positive recommendations.

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:15.240
Do not read this book for sure.

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:18.280
Well, I must say, I mean, unfortunately,

01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:19.920
yeah, well, you can go to my website

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.720
and there's a, you can click on book reviews

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:24.120
and you can see I've written, read a lot of,

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:27.880
I mean, as you can tell from my views about string theory,

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:31.000
I'm not a fan of a lot of the kind of popular books

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.720
about, oh, isn't string theory great?

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:37.040
And about, yes, I'm not a fan of a lot of things

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:37.880
of that kind.

01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:40.480
Can I ask you a good question on this, a small tangent?

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:46.400
Are you a fan, okay, can you explore the pros and cons

01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:50.680
of, if I get string theory, sort of science communication,

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.600
sort of Cosmos style communication of concepts

01:51:56.640 --> 01:51:59.080
to people that are outside of physics,

01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:02.280
outside of mathematics, outside of even the sciences,

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:05.920
and helping people to sort of dream and fill them with awe

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:09.120
about the full range of mysteries in our universe?

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.280
That's a complicated issue.

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:13.720
You know, I think, you know, I certainly go back

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.720
and go back to like what inspired me

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:18.480
and maybe to connect it a little bit

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:19.360
to this question about books.

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.560
I mean, certainly when the books,

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:24.040
some books that I remember reading when I was a kid

01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:26.320
were about the early history of quantum mechanics,

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:29.080
like Heisenberg's books that he wrote about, you know,

01:52:29.080 --> 01:52:31.120
kind of looking back at telling the history

01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:32.960
of what happened when he developed quantum mechanics.

01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:35.440
It's just kind of a totally fascinating,

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.360
romantic, great story.

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:40.040
And those were very inspirational to me.

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.840
And I would think maybe other people

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:44.280
might also find them that.

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:45.120
But the-

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:47.240
And that's almost like the human story

01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:49.120
of the development of the ideas.

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:50.080
Yeah, the human story.

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.800
But yeah, just also how, you know,

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:53.760
there are these very, very weird ideas

01:52:53.760 --> 01:52:55.000
that didn't seem to make sense,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.280
how they were struggling with them

01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:58.320
and how, you know, they actually...

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:01.840
Anyway, it's, I think it's the period of physics

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:05.000
kind of beginning, you know, 1905,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.400
Planck and Einstein and ending up with the war

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:11.280
when these things are, get used to, you know,

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.640
make massively destructive weapons.

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:15.720
It's just the truly amazing.

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.600
So many, so many new ideas.

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:19.760
Let me, on another, a tangent on top of a tangent

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:24.760
on top of a tangent, ask, if we didn't have Einstein,

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.760
so how does science progress?

01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:30.960
Is it the lone geniuses or is it some kind

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.840
of weird network of ideas swimming in the air

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:37.760
and just kind of the geniuses pop up to catch them

01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:39.280
and others would anyway?

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:42.600
Without Einstein, would we have special relativity,

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.720
general relativity?

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:47.280
I mean, it's an interesting case to case base.

01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:51.800
I mean, special relativity, I think we would have had,

01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:53.920
I mean, there are other people.

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:56.680
Anyway, you could even argue that it was already there

01:53:56.680 --> 01:53:57.920
in some form in some ways,

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:00.360
but I think special relativity you would have had

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.320
without Einstein fairly quickly.

01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:07.600
General relativity, that was much, much harder thing to do

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:11.720
and required a much more effort, much more sophisticated.

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.960
That, I think you would have had sooner or later,

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.840
but it would have taken quite a bit longer.

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:20.520
That took a bunch of years to validate scientifically

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:21.760
the general relativity.

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.160
But even for Einstein, from the point

01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:25.920
which he had kind of a general idea

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:27.320
of what he was trying to do to the point

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:29.920
where he actually had a well-defined theory

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:31.880
that you could actually compare to the real world,

01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:35.360
that was, I forget the number of the order of magnitude,

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.760
10 years of very serious work

01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.760
and if he hadn't been around to do that,

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.640
it would have taken a while

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:43.080
before anyone else got around to it.

01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:45.080
On the other hand, there are things like,

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.840
with quantum mechanics, you have Heisenberg

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:52.600
and Schrodinger came up with two,

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.160
which ultimately equivalent,

01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:58.200
but two different approaches to it

01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.680
within months of each other.

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:02.400
And so if Heisenberg hadn't been there,

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.040
you already would have had Schrodinger or whatever.

01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:05.240
And if neither of them had been there,

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:07.600
it would have been somebody else a few months later.

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.760
So there are times when the,

01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:14.760
you know, just the, a lot, often it's the combination

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:17.240
of the right ideas are in place

01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:19.560
and the right experimental data is in place

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.720
to point in the right direction

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:24.080
and it's just waiting for somebody who's gonna find it.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.360
Maybe to go back to your aliens,

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.320
I guess the one thing that I often wonder about aliens

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:33.640
is would they have the same fundamental physics ideas

01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:35.560
as we have in mathematics?

01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:38.480
Would their math, you know, would they, you know,

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:42.120
how much is this really intrinsic to our minds

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:43.800
if you start out with a different kind of mind

01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:46.160
when you end up with a different ideas

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:47.360
of what fundamental physics is

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:49.880
or what the structure of mathematics is?

01:55:49.880 --> 01:55:54.880
So this is why, if I was, you know, I like video games,

01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:58.000
the way I would do it as a curious being,

01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.600
so first experiment I'd like to do

01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:02.600
is run earth over many thousands of times

01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.720
and see if our particular, no, you know what?

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:08.160
I wouldn't do the full evolution.

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.200
You know, start at homo sapiens first

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.840
and then see the evolution of homo sapiens millions of times

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:16.520
and see how the ideas of science would evolve.

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:19.720
Like, would you get, like, how would physics evolve?

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:21.360
How would math evolve?

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.720
I would particularly just be curious

01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.760
about the notation they come up with.

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.800
Every once in a while I would like throw miracles at them

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:31.160
to like, to mess with them and stuff.

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:33.280
And then I would also like to run earth

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.440
from the very beginning to see if evolution

01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:37.200
will produce different kinds of brains

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:38.800
that would then produce different kinds

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.120
of mathematics and physics.

01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:43.440
And then finally, I would probably millions of times

01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:46.960
run the universe over to see what kind of,

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:52.240
what kind of environments and what kind of life

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:55.400
would be created to then lead to intelligent life,

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:59.080
to then lead to theories of mathematics and physics

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:00.840
and to see the full range.

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.040
And like sort of like Darwin kind of Mark,

01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:08.880
okay, it took them, what is it?

01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:13.800
Several hundred million years to come up with calculus.

01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:16.000
I would just like keep noting how long it took

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.040
and get an average and see which ideas are difficult,

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:23.440
which are not, and then conclusively sort of figure out

01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:27.320
if it's more collective intelligence

01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:30.200
or singular intelligence that's responsible for shifts

01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.840
and for big phase shifts and breakthroughs in science.

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.360
If I was playing a video game and ran the thing,

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.280
I got a chance to run this whole thing.

01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:40.200
Yeah, but-

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:41.680
We were talking about books

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:42.520
before I distract you, that's horrible.

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.440
Okay, so books, yeah, go back to books.

01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:47.200
Yeah, so, and then, yeah, so that's one thing I'd recommend

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:50.680
is the books about the, from the original people,

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:53.680
especially Heisenberg about the, how that happened.

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:56.320
And there's also a very, very good kind of history of,

01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:00.480
of the kind of what happened during this 20th century

01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:05.280
in physics and up to the time of the Standard Model in 1973,

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:10.280
it's called The Second Creation by Bob Crease and Mann.

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.880
That's one of the best ones, I know that's,

01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:14.720
but the one thing that I can say is that,

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.560
so that book, I think, forget when it was, late 80s, 90s,

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.160
the problem is that there just hasn't been much

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:24.000
that's actually worked out since then.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.640
So most of the books that are kind of trying to tell you

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:28.360
about all the glorious things that have happened

01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:32.640
since 1973 are, they're mostly telling you

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.840
about how glorious things are,

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.240
which actually don't really work.

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:38.560
And it's really, the argument people sometimes make

01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:40.200
in terms, in favor of these books as well,

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:41.480
oh, you know, they're really great

01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:43.760
because you wanna do something that will get kids excited.

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.320
And then, you know, so they're getting excited

01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.640
about things, something that's not really quite working.

01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:48.680
It doesn't really matter,

01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:50.680
the main thing is get them excited.

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:53.520
The other argument is, you know, wait a minute,

01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:56.680
if you're getting people excited about ideas that are wrong,

01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.960
you're actually kind of discrediting

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:02.160
the whole scientific enterprise in a not really good way.

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:04.640
So there's these problems.

01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:08.720
So my general feeling about expository stuff is, yeah,

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:12.200
to the extent you can do it kind of honestly and well,

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:14.720
that's great, there are a lot of people doing that now.

01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:18.240
But to the extent that you're just trying

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:21.760
to get people excited and enthusiastic

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:24.360
by kind of telling them stuff which isn't really true,

01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:26.520
you really shouldn't be doing that.

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:28.920
You obviously have a much better intuition about physics.

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:32.640
I tend to, in the space of AI, for example,

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:37.640
you could use certain kinds of language,

01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:41.280
like calling things intelligent

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.320
that could rub people the wrong way.

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.680
But I never had a problem with that kind of thing,

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:48.320
you know, saying that a program can learn its way

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.000
without any human supervision

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.680
as AlphaZero does to play chess.

01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:57.840
To me, that may not be intelligence,

01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:01.680
but it sure as heck seems like a few steps

02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:04.520
down the path towards intelligence.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:09.520
And so I think that's a very peculiar property of systems

02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:10.880
that can be engineered.

02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:12.520
So even if the idea is fuzzy,

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:15.200
even if you're not really sure what intelligence is,

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:19.560
or if you don't have a deep fundamental understanding

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.640
or even a model of what intelligence is,

02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:24.520
if you build a system that sure as heck is impressive

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:26.760
and showing some of the signs

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.720
of what previously thought impossible

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:33.880
for a non-intelligent system, then that's impressive

02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:36.680
and that's inspiring and that's okay to celebrate.

02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.880
In physics, because you're not engineering anything,

02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.240
you're just now swimming in the space directly

02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:43.960
when you do theoretical physics,

02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:45.440
that it could be more dangerous.

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:48.720
You could be out too far away from shore.

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:52.840
Well, the problem, I think physics is in a,

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:55.160
I think it's actually hard for people even to believe

02:00:55.160 --> 02:01:00.160
or really understand how that this particular kind

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:02.880
of physics has gotten itself into a really unusual

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:05.280
and strange and historically unusual state,

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:08.520
which is not really, I mean, I spent half my life

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:10.600
among mathematicians and half among physicists,

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:12.880
and you know, mathematics is kind of doing fine.

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.120
People are making progress and it has all the usual problems,

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:21.120
but also, so you could have a, but I just, I don't know,

02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:23.800
I've never seen anything at all happening in mathematics

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:26.360
like what's happened in the specific area in physics.

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.840
It's just the kind of sociology of this,

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.160
the way this field works banging up against

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:37.080
this harder problem without anything

02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:38.560
from experiment to help it.

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.800
It's really, it's led to some really kind

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:44.200
of problematic things and those,

02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:48.000
so it's one thing to kind of oversimplify

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.960
or to slightly misrepresent, to try to explain things

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:52.400
in a way that's not quite right,

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:55.800
but it's another thing to start promoting to people

02:01:56.760 --> 02:02:00.280
as a success is ideas, which really completely failed.

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:03.600
And so, I mean, I've kind of a very, very specific,

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:07.480
if you have people, I won't name any names,

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:09.080
for instance, coming on certain podcasts,

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.560
like yours telling the world, this is a huge success

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.720
and this is really wonderful.

02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:16.520
And it's just not true.

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:19.640
And this is really problematic

02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:22.920
and it carries a serious danger of, you know,

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:26.920
once when people realize that this is what's going on,

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:31.920
you know, the loss of credibility of science

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.720
is a real, real problem for our society.

02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:39.720
And you don't want people to have an all too good reason

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:44.440
to think that what they're being told

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.880
by kind of some of the best institutions

02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.200
in our country and our authorities is not true.

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.680
You know, it's not true, it's a problem.

02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:55.880
It's obviously characteristic of not just physics,

02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:58.960
it's sociology.

02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.960
And it's, I mean, obviously in the space of politics,

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:07.960
it's the history of politics is you sell ideas

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:14.040
to people even when you don't have any proof

02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.400
that those ideas actually work in US because

02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:19.520
if they've worked and that that seems to be the case

02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:20.520
throughout history.

02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:26.480
And just like you said, it's human beings running up

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:28.480
against a really hard problem.

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.480
I'm not sure if this is like a particular,

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:37.040
like trajectory through the progress of physics

02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:38.400
that we're dealing with now,

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.240
or it's just a natural progress of science.

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:44.800
You run up against a really difficult stage of a field

02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:49.800
and different people that behave differently

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:53.080
in the face of that.

02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:56.160
Some sell books and sort of tell narratives

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:57.840
that are beautiful and so on.

02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:00.960
They're not necessarily grounded in solutions

02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:02.720
that have proven themselves.

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.440
Others kind of put their head down quietly,

02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:08.200
keep doing the work, others sort of pivot to different fields

02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:11.400
and that's kind of like ants scattering.

02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.520
And then you have fields like machine learning,

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:17.080
which there was a few folks mostly scattered away

02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:20.960
from machine learning in the 90s in the winter of AI,

02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:23.000
AI winter as they call it.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.720
But a few people kept their head down

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:28.080
and now they're called the fathers of deep learning.

02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:30.240
And they didn't think of it that way.

02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:33.280
And in fact, if there's another AI winter,

02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.560
they'll just probably keep working on it anyway,

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:40.440
sort of like loyal ants sticking to a particular thing.

02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:43.160
So it's interesting, but you're sort of saying

02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:46.720
that we should be careful over hyping things

02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:48.400
that have not proven themselves

02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:53.400
because people will lose trust in the scientific process.

02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:57.840
But unfortunately, there's been other ways

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:00.800
in which people have lost trust in the scientific process

02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:02.240
that ultimately has to do actually

02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:05.120
with all the same kind of behavior as you're highlighting,

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:08.360
which is not being honest and transparent

02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:11.600
about the flaws of mistakes of the past.

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.120
Yeah, I mean, that's always a problem,

02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:15.920
but this particular field is kind of,

02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:18.840
it's always a strange one.

02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:20.400
I mean, I think in the sense that

02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:23.240
there's a lot of public fascination with it

02:05:23.240 --> 02:05:25.800
that it seems to speak to kind of our deepest questions

02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:28.480
about what is this physical reality,

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.320
where do we come from and these kind of deep issues.

02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:33.960
So there's this unusual fascination with it.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.440
Mathematics, for instance, is very different.

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:37.520
Nobody's that interested in mathematics.

02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:39.160
Nobody really kind of expects

02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.520
to learn really great deep things about the world

02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:43.560
from mathematics that much.

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:45.080
They don't ask mathematicians that.

02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:47.640
So it's a very unusual,

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:51.120
it draws this kind of unusual amount of attention

02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:54.880
and it really is historically in a really unusual state.

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:57.480
It's kind of, it's gotten itself

02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:01.240
way kind of down a blind alley

02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:03.600
in a way which,

02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:06.520
it's hard to find other historical parallels.

02:06:06.520 --> 02:06:08.440
But sort of to push back a little bit,

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:10.680
there's power to inspiring people.

02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:14.000
And if I just empirically look,

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.960
physicists are really good

02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:22.960
at combining science and philosophy

02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:24.400
and communicating it.

02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:26.240
Like there's something about physics often

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:28.920
that forces you to build a strong intuition

02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.280
about the way reality works, right?

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:34.240
And that allows you to think through sort of

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:37.320
and communicate about all kinds of questions.

02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.960
Like if you see physicists, it's always fascinating

02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.040
to take on problems that have nothing to do

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:43.480
with their particular discipline.

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:45.920
They think in interesting ways

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:47.640
and they're able to communicate their thinking

02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:48.640
in interesting ways.

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:52.160
And so in some sense, they have a responsibility

02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:55.600
not just to do science, but to inspire.

02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:57.880
And not responsibility, but the opportunity.

02:06:58.040 --> 02:07:02.640
And thereby I would say a little bit of a responsibility.

02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:05.680
Yeah, in some sense, but I don't know, anyway,

02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:07.880
it's hard to say because different,

02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:10.640
there's many, many people doing this kind of thing

02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:15.560
with different degrees of success and whatever.

02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:19.720
I guess one thing, but I mean,

02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:21.160
what's kind of front and center for me

02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:22.880
is kind of a more parochial interest

02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:27.840
is just kind of what damage do you do to the subject

02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:32.320
itself, ignoring, misrepresenting

02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.280
what high school students think about string theory

02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:36.520
and not that it doesn't matter much,

02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:40.240
but what the smartest undergraduates

02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:42.120
or the smartest graduate students in the world

02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:45.160
think about it and what paths you're leading them down

02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:47.080
and what story you're telling them

02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:49.640
and what textbooks you're making them read

02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:50.800
and what they're hearing.

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:53.040
And so a lot of what's motivated me

02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:57.400
is more to try to speak to kind of a specific population

02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:00.080
of people to make sure that, look, people,

02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:05.560
it doesn't matter so much what the average person

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:07.000
on the street thinks about string theory,

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:12.000
but what the best students at Columbia or Harvard

02:08:12.120 --> 02:08:14.920
or Princeton or whatever who really wanna change,

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:16.680
work in this field and wanna work that way,

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.360
what they know about it, what they think about it

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:22.080
and that they not be going to the field being misled

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:23.840
and believing that a certain story,

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.120
this is where this is all going, this is what I gotta do,

02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:29.080
that's important to me.

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:31.440
Well, in general, for graduate students,

02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:34.240
for people who seek to be experts in the field,

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:36.520
diversity of ideas is really powerful

02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:40.720
and is getting into this local pocket of ideas

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:43.880
that people hold onto for several decades is not good,

02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:44.880
no matter what the idea.

02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:47.880
I would say no matter if the idea is right or wrong

02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:51.560
because there's no such thing as right in the long term.

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:56.400
Like it's right for now until somebody builds on

02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:58.120
something much bigger on top of it.

02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.000
It might end up being right, but being a tiny subset

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:03.560
of a much bigger thing.

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:07.480
So you always should question sort of the ways of the past.

02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:12.320
Yeah, so how to kind of achieve that kind of diversity

02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:15.080
of thought and within kind of the sociology

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:17.680
of how we organize scientific research is,

02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:19.520
I know there's one thing that I think it's very interesting

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.760
that Sabina Hassenfelder has very interesting things

02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:23.880
to say about it.

02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:25.560
I think also Lee Smolin in his book,

02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:29.920
which is also about that very much in agreement with them

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:34.680
that there's, anyway, there's a really kind of important

02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:41.240
questions about how research in this field is organized

02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:45.200
and how people, what can you do to kind of get

02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:48.280
and get more diversity of thought and get people thinking

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.160
about a wider range of ideas.

02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:55.840
At the bottom, I think humility always helps.

02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:59.880
Well, but the problem is that it's also,

02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:02.760
it's a combination of humility to know when you're wrong

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:05.600
and also, but also you have to have a,

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:08.160
you have to have a certain very serious lack of humility

02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:09.680
to believe that you're gonna make progress

02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:11.160
on some of these problems.

02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:13.240
I think you have to have like both modes

02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:15.600
and switch between them when needed.

02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:20.280
Let me ask you a question you probably not gonna

02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:24.800
wanna answer because you're focused on the mathematics

02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:27.720
of things and mathematics can't answer the why questions,

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:30.640
but let me ask you anyway.

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.400
Do you think there's meaning to this whole thing?

02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:35.000
What do you think is the meaning of life?

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.880
Why are we here?

02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:37.720
I don't know.

02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.600
Yeah, I was thinking about this.

02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:42.280
So the, and it did occur to me,

02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:47.200
what interesting thing about that question is that you don't,

02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:51.040
so I have this life in mathematics

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:54.040
and this life in physics and I see some

02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:58.640
of my physicist colleagues kind of seem to be,

02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:00.600
people are often asking them what's the meaning of life

02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:02.280
and they're writing books about the meaning of life

02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.600
and teaching courses about the meaning of life.

02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.480
But then I realized that no one ever asked

02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:07.800
my mathematician colleagues,

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.680
nobody ever asked mathematicians.

02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:11.520
Yeah, that's funny.

02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:15.040
So yeah, everybody just kind of assumes,

02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:16.640
okay, well, you people are studying about that,

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:19.400
whatever you're doing, it's maybe very interesting,

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.200
but it's clearly not gonna tell me anything useful

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:22.320
about the meaning of my life.

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:25.800
And I'm afraid a lot of my point of view is that

02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:28.200
if people realized how little difference there was

02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:29.720
between what the mathematicians are doing

02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:31.520
and what a lot of these theoretical physicists are doing,

02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:34.160
they would, they might understand that

02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:38.200
it's a bit misguided to look for deep insight

02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:42.560
into the meaning of life from many theoretical physicists.

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.200
It's not a, they, you know, they're people

02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:47.200
they may have interesting things to say about this.

02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:48.040
You're right.

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:50.200
They have, they know a lot about physical reality

02:11:50.200 --> 02:11:53.920
and about, in some sense about metaphysics,

02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:56.800
about what is real of this kind.

02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:01.800
But you're also, to my mind,

02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:03.800
I think you're also making a bit of a mistake

02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:07.960
that you're looking to, I mean, I'm very, very aware

02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:10.640
that, you know, I've led a very pleasant

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:12.040
and fairly privileged existence

02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:15.280
of a fairly, without many challenges of different kinds

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:16.720
and of a certain kind.

02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:21.480
And I'm really not, in no way the kind of person

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:24.800
that a lot of people were looking for to try

02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:27.440
and understand in some sense, the meaning of life

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:30.320
in the sense of the challenges that they're facing in life.

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.680
I can't really, I'm really the wrong person

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:34.000
for you to be asking about this.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Well, if struggle is somehow a thing that's core to meaning,

02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:42.440
perhaps mathematicians are just quietly the ones

02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:45.120
who are most equipped to answer that question

02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:49.960
if, in fact, the creation or at least experiencing beauty

02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:55.800
is at the core of the meaning of life.

02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:59.360
Because it seems like mathematics is the methodology

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:04.040
by which you can most purely explore beautiful things, right?

02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:05.240
Yeah.

02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:07.000
So in some sense, maybe we should talk

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.880
to mathematicians more.

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.560
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.600
But unfortunately, I think, you know,

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:14.880
people do have a somewhat correct perception

02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:17.040
that what these people are doing every day

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.680
or whatever is pretty far removed from anything.

02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:26.120
Yeah, from what's kind of close to what I do every day

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:28.040
and what my typical concerns are.

02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:29.720
So you may learn something very interesting

02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:31.040
by talking to mathematicians,

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.840
but it's probably not gonna be,

02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:37.080
you're probably not gonna get what you were hoping.

02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:39.520
So when you put the pen and paper down

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.480
and you're not thinking about physics

02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:43.360
and you're not thinking about mathematics

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.520
and you just get to breathe in the air

02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:47.520
and look around you and realize

02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.280
that you're going to die one day.

02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:50.120
Yeah.

02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:51.160
Do you think about that?

02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:57.000
Your ideas will live on, but you, the human.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.400
Not especially much.

02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:00.200
Certainly I've been getting older.

02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:01.920
I'm now 64 years old.

02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:02.760
You start to realize, well,

02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:05.720
there's probably less ahead than there was behind.

02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:09.600
And so you start to, that starts to become,

02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:10.440
what do I think about that?

02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:13.400
Maybe I should actually get serious

02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:14.760
about getting some things done,

02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:17.000
which I may not have,

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:18.720
which I may otherwise not have time to do,

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:20.360
which I didn't see.

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:22.200
This didn't seem to be a problem when I was younger,

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.080
but that's the main,

02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:26.840
I think the main way in which that thought occurred.

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:30.040
But it doesn't, the Stoics are big on this,

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:32.080
meditating on mortality

02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:36.560
helps you more intensely appreciate the beauty

02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:38.040
when you do experience it.

02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:41.600
I suppose that's true, but it's not, yeah,

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:45.920
it's not something I've spent a lot of time trying,

02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:47.200
but yeah.

02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:49.800
Day to day, you just enjoy the puzzles and mathematics.

02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:52.480
Just enjoy, yeah, or life in general.

02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:55.760
Life is, I have a perfectly pleasant life

02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:00.240
and enjoy it and often think, wow, this is,

02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:02.640
things are, I'm really enjoying this,

02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:04.360
things are going well.

02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:06.560
Yeah, life is pretty amazing.

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:08.240
I think you and I are pretty lucky.

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:11.800
We get to live on this nice little earth

02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:13.400
with a nice little comfortable climate

02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:17.200
and we get to have this nice little podcast conversation.

02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:19.120
Thank you so much for spending your valuable time

02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:21.200
with me today and having this conversation.

02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:22.040
Thank you.

02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:23.400
Glad, thank you, thank you.

02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:28.000
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Peter White.

02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:29.280
To support this podcast,

02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:32.120
please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:34.120
And now let me leave you with some words

02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:36.200
from Richard Feynman.

02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:40.280
The first principle is that you must not fool yourself

02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:43.160
and you are the easiest person to fool.

02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:47.240
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
