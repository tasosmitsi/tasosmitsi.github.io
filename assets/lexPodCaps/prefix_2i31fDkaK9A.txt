WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.740
I tweet that and then I finished the day and I wake up the next morning and I glance at

00:04.740 --> 00:05.740
my phone.

00:05.740 --> 00:10.980
I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are, you know, quote tweeting it and demanding

00:10.980 --> 00:12.380
a retraction and whatever.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.660
And I go, Oh, okay.

00:13.660 --> 00:16.540
This looks like it's getting, it looks like it's getting some attention.

00:16.540 --> 00:21.500
Um, I then continue about my day around noon.

00:21.500 --> 00:29.300
I hear from my dad that he got a hundred messages from you should have aborted your son to we're

00:29.300 --> 00:31.540
going to find all of you to whatever else.

00:31.540 --> 00:32.860
My dad has no idea what's going on.

00:32.860 --> 00:37.860
He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have a hundred DMS to everything else you

00:37.860 --> 00:38.860
can imagine.

00:38.860 --> 00:47.260
Um, and I start to get emails about, you know, we, you know, your Jewish faith, this and

00:47.260 --> 00:48.820
that and the other thing.

00:48.820 --> 00:53.500
And so at that point to me, I thought this is just going to get worse and worse and worse.

00:53.500 --> 00:58.220
And so I deleted the tweet and I really regret doing that because over the 48 hours that

00:58.220 --> 01:01.860
followed, yes, the attacks escalated.

01:01.860 --> 01:07.500
It went through Candace Owens and then at Foxnews.com Newsmax kind of peaking with,

01:07.500 --> 01:09.380
with Donald Trump Jr.

01:09.380 --> 01:12.620
And it was horrible.

01:12.620 --> 01:16.660
The following is a conversation with David Pakman, a left-wing progressive political

01:16.660 --> 01:20.300
commentator and host of the David Pakman show.

01:20.300 --> 01:25.860
I hope to continue to have many conversations on politics with prominent, insightful and

01:25.900 --> 01:30.180
sometimes controversial figures across the political spectrum.

01:30.180 --> 01:34.340
David and I have been planning to speak for a long time and I'm sure we'll speak many

01:34.340 --> 01:35.500
more times.

01:35.500 --> 01:39.660
This conversation was challenging, eye-opening and fun.

01:39.660 --> 01:41.420
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:41.420 --> 01:44.700
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:44.700 --> 01:49.340
And now, dear friends, here's David Pakman.

01:49.340 --> 01:54.980
Are there interesting differences to you between terms like liberal, Democrat, left-wing, leftist,

01:55.060 --> 02:00.180
progressive, socialist, communist, Marxist, far-left, center-left, all of these labels?

02:00.180 --> 02:02.180
Is there interesting distinctions between them?

02:02.180 --> 02:04.420
Yeah, there's two sets of distinctions.

02:04.420 --> 02:08.780
One is if you just want to say, let's define each of these as political terms, they're

02:08.780 --> 02:09.780
all different terms.

02:09.780 --> 02:14.380
You can be a progressive ideologically, but not be a member of the Democratic Party.

02:14.380 --> 02:17.100
Many say the Democratic Party isn't even really very progressive.

02:17.100 --> 02:22.620
So these are certainly terms that we could define in order to have a conversation about

02:22.860 --> 02:27.300
the next thing, kind of as a precursor to a conversation.

02:27.300 --> 02:35.720
Sometimes the terms are used in order to tag someone with a certain ideology that's not

02:35.720 --> 02:41.700
really linked to policy or any particular political question, but they can be used positively

02:41.700 --> 02:46.600
or negatively to just kind of say, here's the image of this individual that I have in

02:46.600 --> 02:47.600
my mind.

02:48.080 --> 02:56.080
Marxist is right now very popularly being used by some on the right to attack Democrats.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.440
There's very few actual Marxists, certainly not in positions of power in the United States,

03:00.440 --> 03:03.800
but even among the general population.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.860
So I think it's important to distinguish, are we defining these terms because we want

03:06.860 --> 03:12.040
to compare and contrast the ideas that a particular group might bring to the discussion or are

03:12.040 --> 03:15.020
we using them as insults or to stifle conversation?

03:15.020 --> 03:18.700
There are terms that can be used to start a conversation or to stop it.

03:18.700 --> 03:22.940
And the use of those terms is evolving rapidly month by month.

03:22.940 --> 03:27.500
So the term leftist, I think, is a relatively popular term now to use in the negative context

03:27.500 --> 03:34.940
to describe what an outraged left wing commentator.

03:34.940 --> 03:41.800
I think what you're kind of grasping onto is that there's probably some set of ideas

03:42.040 --> 03:46.320
that would apply to most of those who consider themselves to be on the left.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.920
The discussion of how that term is mostly being used is not about policy ideas.

03:50.920 --> 03:55.040
You're accurately kind of identifying that.

03:55.040 --> 03:59.880
And it does seem like progressive is no longer being used as a smear and leftist is being

03:59.880 --> 04:01.760
used as a smear more at this point.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.760
Okay.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.480
But sometimes some of these terms are useful.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.600
Like, can we try to pick the terms that are useful?

04:07.600 --> 04:13.400
Like liberal and progressive and Democrat, liberal and progressive.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.840
Is there an interesting, definable distinction between liberal and progressive to you?

04:17.840 --> 04:20.560
That's maybe one of the most interesting ones.

04:20.560 --> 04:27.560
Ten years ago, liberal often meant what now we mean by progressive.

04:27.560 --> 04:34.880
More recently, the progressive socialist leaning part of the political spectrum has started

04:34.880 --> 04:42.680
to use liberal to mean Joe Biden, to mean someone who is not really left enough.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.560
So liberals very interesting because I remember talking with my audience years ago, maybe

04:46.560 --> 04:51.040
eight years ago or something like that, where I identified I'm going to now use the term

04:51.040 --> 04:56.600
progressive more commonly to describe my own beliefs because liberal has now been made

04:56.600 --> 04:57.600
a smear.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.980
It's being shifted into something else and it also means more of like a center left politics.

05:02.980 --> 05:10.100
So it's changed in some sense by necessity, by force, and also because the spectrum has

05:10.100 --> 05:11.660
shifted to some degree.

05:11.660 --> 05:20.100
So the term liberal has evolved now liberal, meaning some kind of embodiment of the mainstream

05:20.100 --> 05:23.060
democratic party, almost to some degree.

05:23.060 --> 05:28.380
Sometimes I'm called, I'm written off by, you know, within my space, there are all sorts

05:28.380 --> 05:33.740
of shades of gray, which I'm sure we can talk about about where I am versus should be, could

05:33.740 --> 05:36.220
be, or am wrongly placed.

05:36.220 --> 05:42.580
And sometimes an attack on me is he's just a lib, meaning I'm not left enough.

05:42.580 --> 05:46.900
I'm not progressive socialist wherever else you want to go.

05:46.900 --> 05:51.740
So yeah, the, the problem with a lot of these terms and they're used very casually by people

05:51.740 --> 05:56.940
who call into my show is that unless we actually define them each time, they very often mean

05:56.940 --> 06:00.820
very different things to different people and often come with an agenda attached to

06:00.820 --> 06:01.820
them.

06:01.820 --> 06:06.380
And so I find that they often stifle meaningful conversation rather than encourage it.

06:06.380 --> 06:13.300
Do you sense that there's a drifting of what is the threshold to be a progressive or is

06:13.300 --> 06:19.100
there, it should be used progressive synonymously with a democratic socialist.

06:19.100 --> 06:22.500
I think we should not use it synonymously with democratic socialist.

06:22.660 --> 06:27.720
And this is where there's another linguistic confusion and a political confusion.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.020
So we'll first talk about the linguistic one.

06:31.020 --> 06:37.540
Social democracy versus democratic socialism, very similar words in a different order.

06:37.540 --> 06:38.540
Okay.

06:38.540 --> 06:46.420
My, the way I operate is democratic socialism is actually a form of socialism where one

06:46.420 --> 06:49.760
would seek to socialize ownership of the means of production.

06:49.760 --> 06:56.040
As an example, social democracy is a very highly regulated form of capitalism, the likes

06:56.040 --> 06:59.860
of which we would see in Northern Europe, Denmark, et cetera.

06:59.860 --> 07:01.640
These are very different things.

07:01.640 --> 07:08.960
I associate progressivism in 2023 with social democracy and would consider democratic socialism

07:08.960 --> 07:11.840
a form of actual socialism that is different.

07:11.840 --> 07:16.100
We're no longer talking about a capitalist organization of society.

07:16.100 --> 07:22.400
So transition from one to the other is a fundamental shift in how, in how society operates then.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.600
Absolutely.

07:23.600 --> 07:29.380
And when you talk about social democracy, you're talking about socializing a couple

07:29.380 --> 07:36.020
more things than we socialize in most modern capitalist countries.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.320
I had this conversation with Patrick bet David recently.

07:39.320 --> 07:44.220
Social democracy is, okay, we've socialized the military already in the United States.

07:44.220 --> 07:49.680
We've socialized some healthcare in the sense of like the VA and Medicaid, et cetera.

07:49.680 --> 07:55.860
We're talking about socializing a couple more things still in a capitalist country.

07:55.860 --> 07:59.000
Democratic socialism would be something beyond that.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.020
And as someone who is not a democratic socialist myself, I'm maybe not the best advocate for

08:05.020 --> 08:10.480
explaining exactly how that system would function, but it would have some version of socializing

08:10.480 --> 08:13.520
ownership of the means of production, businesses, et cetera.

08:13.520 --> 08:20.000
So you mentioned you appeared on the PBD podcast with Patrick bet David.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.020
The debate was pretty intense.

08:22.020 --> 08:25.400
I should say I personally enjoyed it.

08:25.400 --> 08:30.700
I thought actually you did well and I thought Patrick did well and it was a good conversation.

08:30.700 --> 08:31.700
I thought it was.

08:31.700 --> 08:32.700
There was a little bit of tension.

08:32.700 --> 08:33.700
Yeah.

08:33.700 --> 08:36.700
And I thought that Patrick actually, so I disagreed with the internet.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.080
I thought Patrick just took on a kind of devil's advocate.

08:39.640 --> 08:44.800
He was purposely being stubborn to bring out the best in you, but the internet thought

08:44.800 --> 08:48.360
that he's being stubborn, not being open to your ideas.

08:48.360 --> 08:53.960
I thought the tension between ideas, I think a lot of the tension had to do probably with

08:53.960 --> 08:57.200
Donald Trump and Trump supporters.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.760
That certainly could be the case.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.720
And people wrote to me, people wrote to me the full gamut of everything you can imagine

09:02.720 --> 09:07.600
from this was your best thing you've ever done in public to you got humiliated and your

09:07.600 --> 09:08.800
mother should have aborted you.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.600
And everything in between.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.920
So you know, take your pick.

09:11.920 --> 09:18.320
But the most interesting feedback I got was from people who asked me after was it incredibly

09:18.320 --> 09:21.080
tense and awkward and because it seemed so combative.

09:21.080 --> 09:27.080
And I think for I'm so used to those types of tensions in the discussions that I have

09:27.080 --> 09:28.200
that it's very comfortable to me.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.020
It's not like afterwards it's it's there's a grudge or it's tense or whatever the case

09:32.020 --> 09:33.020
may be.

09:33.020 --> 09:34.020
I'm very comfortable.

09:34.020 --> 09:36.000
Just I disagree with people and that's it.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.280
So I did not find anything that happened inappropriate.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.560
I disagreed with a lot of the things he said, certainly.

09:40.560 --> 09:46.960
So you've also spoken to Michael Knowles, I think, about the idea of what is a woman.

09:46.960 --> 09:53.520
Do you can you speak broadly about your conversations with people you disagree with?

09:53.520 --> 09:56.880
You know, some of the cases, it feels like it's gone wrong.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.680
The conversations have gone wrong.

09:58.680 --> 09:59.680
Yeah.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.680
Yeah.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.680
I mean, I think there's a couple of different things.

10:01.680 --> 10:07.720
And I'm the first to tell you that depending on who I'm talking to, I go in with a different

10:08.360 --> 10:14.200
attitude about how, quote, seriously I'm taking it in the sense of whether I think it's going

10:14.200 --> 10:19.040
to be a deep policy discussion versus whether it's going to be more of a performance for

10:19.040 --> 10:21.880
an audience that is expecting a certain thing.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.360
And I think there's different types of shows.

10:23.360 --> 10:27.240
When I was interviewed by this guy, Jesse Lee Peterson in Los Angeles, it's very different,

10:27.240 --> 10:29.720
for example, than when I'm talking to Patrick Bette David.

10:29.720 --> 10:35.200
Just to give two two examples, I think the reason I stopped doing the Michael Knowles

10:35.200 --> 10:38.840
show was the number of threats I would get after the fact.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.480
That's really the I was glad to engage with him to the extent that the interviews were

10:42.480 --> 10:47.120
interesting and, you know, we could organize it reasonably efficiently.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.480
But the reason I stepped away was sort of the aftermath.

10:50.480 --> 10:57.380
But I did find him to be someone who was abundantly clear about his view and where he comes from.

10:57.380 --> 11:01.580
And while I could not possibly disagree more with him in terms of politics and culture

11:01.780 --> 11:04.460
and our backgrounds, everything is just so, so different.

11:04.460 --> 11:10.180
I found it easy to engage in the conversation just because of how upfront and clear he was

11:10.180 --> 11:12.460
about what his beliefs were.

11:12.460 --> 11:13.460
But the number of threats.

11:13.460 --> 11:14.460
Yeah.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.340
Yeah, it was just too much.

11:16.340 --> 11:21.020
And this, you know, I don't know how much you saw about this recent Twitter dust up

11:21.020 --> 11:25.900
I was involved in that peaked with Donald Trump Jr. tweeting about me and then that

11:25.900 --> 11:28.020
then declining from there.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.020
Let's talk through it.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.020
I didn't see it.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.020
OK.

11:31.260 --> 11:32.260
We study Shakespeare.

11:32.260 --> 11:33.260
I have to study your Twitter.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.700
I have to understand some how much of a sarcasm.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.700
Mostly sarcasm.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.100
I mean, here's the thing.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.340
And I know that there are people who will say, David, you're dealing with such serious

11:42.340 --> 11:43.340
issues.

11:43.340 --> 11:47.380
It's really not OK not to take everything you do completely seriously.

11:47.380 --> 11:53.620
But my view is it's so incredible that I've between chance and timing and so different

11:53.620 --> 11:58.780
things fallen into a position where this is what I do professionally and it's a career

11:59.020 --> 12:01.940
and it's financially sustainable and all these different things.

12:01.940 --> 12:07.740
I don't want to end up taking myself too seriously because I recognize the timing and luck and

12:07.740 --> 12:08.740
all of these other things.

12:08.740 --> 12:11.040
And this could have gone a completely different way.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.420
So my approach to a lot of this is let's not take ourselves too seriously.

12:15.420 --> 12:19.580
And in particular on Twitter, a platform that, you know, the degree to which it should be

12:19.580 --> 12:23.360
taken very seriously maybe has changed over time.

12:23.360 --> 12:27.020
I'm always sort of thinking a little bit tongue in cheek on Twitter.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.580
So what happened with Donald Trump, Jr.?

12:29.580 --> 12:31.580
So or the full arc of it?

12:31.580 --> 12:32.580
Yeah.

12:32.580 --> 12:37.460
To make give you a one minute arc and then we can pick whichever parts we want after

12:37.460 --> 12:38.460
a mass shooting.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.420
Now, you might say there's like two or three a day.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.580
You're correct.

12:41.580 --> 12:49.740
After the Nashville mass shooting at a Christian school, I tweeted snarkily tongue in cheek

12:49.740 --> 12:56.560
to point that thoughts and prayers not only aren't particularly useful after a shooting,

12:56.560 --> 13:02.560
they also don't prevent shootings, that there's some confusion about how there would be a

13:02.560 --> 13:07.600
shooting at a Christian school given that it is a place where prayer is taking place.

13:07.600 --> 13:13.300
I think I jokingly said something like, were they not praying enough or correctly in my

13:13.300 --> 13:15.280
deep journalistic integrity?

13:15.280 --> 13:16.280
You have it.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.280
I have your tweet.

13:17.280 --> 13:22.880
You know, this is the only display of journalistic integrity I will show today.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.880
OK.

13:23.880 --> 13:24.880
And I have a couple of responses.

13:24.880 --> 13:25.880
Beautiful.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.200
I haven't tweeted the tweets since then.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.200
Which I regret.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.200
Oh, interesting.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.200
And we can talk about that.

13:30.200 --> 13:35.120
I would love to, because it's such an interesting decision.

13:35.120 --> 13:39.040
Because when you tweet something, one of the things I've also learned is you don't often

13:39.040 --> 13:42.840
understand how it's going to be read.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.840
It's going to be analyzed like I mentioned Shakespeare, like there's certain the use

13:46.840 --> 13:51.760
of certain words that you regret saying in a certain kind of way, maybe just because

13:51.760 --> 13:58.080
it wasn't as eloquent as powerful, it didn't actually convey the thing, or is the distraction

13:58.080 --> 13:59.840
to the main message, all that kind of stuff.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.840
OK.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.840
The actual tweet is very surprising that there would be a mass shooting at a Christian school

14:04.840 --> 14:09.240
given that lack of prayer is often blamed for these horrible events.

14:09.240 --> 14:15.600
Is it possible they weren't praying enough or correctly despite being a Christian school?

14:15.600 --> 14:25.920
And a lot of people quote, retweeted that, which I'm assuming was criticism.

14:25.920 --> 14:30.720
So Colin Wright wrote, I used to consider you a reasonable progressive, but you clearly

14:30.720 --> 14:32.560
devolved into partisan hackery.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.800
I'm an atheist.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.800
It cannot begin to fathom using the murder of children and adults at a Christian school

14:37.800 --> 14:40.960
as an opportunity to dunk on the concept of prayer.

14:40.960 --> 14:45.080
And you responded, I'm dunking on the people who send thoughts and prayers and do nothing

14:45.560 --> 14:46.560
else.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.560
And the shootings continue.

14:47.560 --> 14:48.560
OK.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.560
I'm sure there's a lot of other interactions.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.160
There's a few other hundred thousand interactions.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.680
So do you want the arc leading to the leading?

14:54.680 --> 14:55.680
Yes.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
Sorry.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.680
I just wanted to display.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.280
Do you know what time of day I tweeted the original one?

14:59.280 --> 15:09.720
I feel like it was in the afternoon or evening of on a Monday, 3 42 p.m. on 27th, March 27th,

15:09.720 --> 15:10.720
which was a Monday.

15:10.720 --> 15:11.720
OK.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.040
So basically I tweet that and then I finished the day.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.080
So you tweet and then you go on with your day.

15:17.080 --> 15:23.040
I might have looked once at Twitter and it had 2000 likes and a few people saying, this

15:23.040 --> 15:27.080
might have missed the mark, but it's sort of like it's one of my twenty thousand tweets.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.080
I don't know.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.760
I wake up the next morning.

15:29.760 --> 15:33.140
My baby daughter did not sleep till seven thirty the way I would like.

15:33.140 --> 15:38.120
So she's up at six a.m. and I get up and I'm just there starting to make breakfast and

15:38.120 --> 15:40.860
I glance at my phone and I'm starting to.

15:40.860 --> 15:44.240
This was when verified meant a different thing than it means now.

15:44.240 --> 15:49.500
I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are, you know, quote, tweeting it and demanding

15:49.500 --> 15:50.900
a retraction and whatever.

15:50.900 --> 15:55.940
And I go, oh, OK, this looks like it's getting looks like it's getting some attention.

15:55.940 --> 15:59.260
I then continue about my day.

15:59.260 --> 16:05.460
Around noon, I hear from my dad that he got a hundred messages from you should have aborted

16:05.460 --> 16:10.060
your son to we're going to find all of you to whatever else.

16:10.060 --> 16:11.380
My dad has no idea what's going on.

16:11.380 --> 16:16.380
He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have a hundred DMS to everything else you

16:16.380 --> 16:18.620
can imagine.

16:18.620 --> 16:25.780
And I start to get emails about, you know, we, you know, your Jewish faith, this and

16:25.780 --> 16:27.340
that and the other thing.

16:27.340 --> 16:32.020
And so at that point to me, I thought this is just going to get worse and worse and worse.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.700
And so I deleted the tweet.

16:33.700 --> 16:39.360
And I really regret doing that because over the 48 hours that followed, yes, the attacks

16:39.360 --> 16:40.360
escalated.

16:40.360 --> 16:45.840
It went through Candace Owens and then at Fox News dot com Newsmax kind of peaking with

16:45.840 --> 16:48.800
with Donald Trump Jr. and it was horrible.

16:48.800 --> 16:53.160
I mean, thousands and thousands of the OK.

16:53.160 --> 16:59.640
But once I told my audience about what happened, I got thousands of messages from people saying,

16:59.640 --> 17:06.600
David, only someone who doesn't know you and is determined to interpret this in the worst

17:06.600 --> 17:12.000
possible faith would think you're blaming kids who died for getting shot.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.420
Of course you weren't doing that.

17:13.420 --> 17:19.340
I wish you hadn't deleted it so that it would still be up and you would now see the tide

17:19.340 --> 17:21.360
kind of turning on it.

17:21.360 --> 17:27.720
This was not a fun three days regardless, but I do regret having deleted it because

17:27.720 --> 17:28.720
it was a pan.

17:28.720 --> 17:34.120
I wanted to do the quickest thing I thought I could to get people to stop trying to find

17:34.160 --> 17:36.560
family members and send them threats.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.840
And so around noon, that's what I did.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.880
And the truth is the threats didn't stop anyway because everybody had screenshotted it.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.480
And I do wish I had left it up.

17:45.480 --> 17:51.920
Is there some degree, maybe stepping outside yourself, do you regret tweeting that in that

17:51.920 --> 17:57.080
it feeds the mockery engine that that fuels Twitter?

17:57.080 --> 18:02.560
So like, does that tweet really represent what you believe?

18:02.600 --> 18:11.600
It absolutely represents the disgust with a politics that includes saying we can't touch

18:11.600 --> 18:12.600
guns.

18:12.600 --> 18:18.440
We just, we can't, but we're willing to point to mental health or say we need more prayer

18:18.440 --> 18:19.880
in schools or whatever.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.840
1000% it represents that view.

18:23.840 --> 18:29.280
Is it the type of snark and sarcasm that I would use if given an hour to discuss the

18:29.280 --> 18:32.840
topic rather than whatever the number of characters is now on Twitter?

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
No, definitely not.

18:33.840 --> 18:41.240
And so I am very cognizant of the fact that it was unnecessarily provocative how it was

18:41.240 --> 18:43.200
written.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.200
I think I asked a similar question to Ben Shapiro.

18:46.200 --> 18:51.560
Do you worry that this style of presentation can turn you from being, you know, a deeply

18:52.000 --> 19:01.160
thoughtful, objective political thinker to somebody who is just a partisan hack or partisan,

19:01.160 --> 19:03.240
what's a good word, talking head?

19:03.240 --> 19:06.160
Do you mean with regard to Twitter or the format of my show in general?

19:06.160 --> 19:09.120
So Twitter for now, let's start with Twitter for now.

19:09.120 --> 19:17.000
And can you silo your style of communication on Twitter from being a virus that affects

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
your mind?

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Right.

19:19.040 --> 19:25.000
I don't have deep thoughts about the Twitter component beyond, I think, across all sorts

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
of disciplines.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.920
This is not the best way to most effectively solve problems and figure out solutions to

19:31.920 --> 19:32.920
complex issues.

19:32.920 --> 19:33.920
You're talking about Twitter.

19:33.920 --> 19:34.920
Now.

19:34.920 --> 19:35.920
Right now I'm talking about Twitter.

19:35.920 --> 19:36.920
Yes.

19:36.920 --> 19:43.520
That being said, I think all of us to some degree have to adapt our content to the platform

19:43.520 --> 19:46.960
that we're using in the same way that what I post to YouTube is different than what I

19:46.960 --> 19:48.640
post to TikTok.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.500
What I post to Twitter is also different.

19:51.500 --> 19:56.560
Do I think Twitter has been an unmitigated good for society?

19:56.560 --> 19:57.920
No.

19:57.920 --> 20:03.000
Have I chosen to step into Twitter as one of the ways in which I get my message out

20:03.000 --> 20:05.040
with the good and the bad?

20:05.040 --> 20:06.040
Yes.

20:06.040 --> 20:10.400
And I think that there is a deep conversation to be had there.

20:10.400 --> 20:14.320
I think zooming out a little bit in terms of what I do, and I was hoping this would

20:14.320 --> 20:16.680
come up because I think it's really interesting.

20:16.680 --> 20:20.200
I will often get emails from people who say two things.

20:20.200 --> 20:24.540
I will get the you would have such a bigger audience if you did X type emails.

20:24.540 --> 20:32.040
And usually they are plays to sensationalism, salacious and titillating content, more pop

20:32.040 --> 20:34.800
culture stuff, et cetera.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.440
On the other hand, it's folks who say, listen, what you're doing really isn't as serious

20:39.440 --> 20:41.040
as it could be.

20:41.040 --> 20:46.280
And it seems like you could do something more serious and you should consider doing deep

20:46.680 --> 20:47.680
dives.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.680
You know, once it was do a deep dive into Calvin Coolidge.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.640
And I was like, nobody will watch that.

20:50.640 --> 20:56.600
So there it's not by accident that my show is the way it is right in an hour.

20:56.600 --> 21:01.820
I'm thinking of all the platforms I'm on and I'm saying, OK, I want to do a relatively

21:01.820 --> 21:04.960
deep dive on the federal budget.

21:04.960 --> 21:11.560
And I want to talk about some of the political tomfoolery going on within the post office.

21:11.560 --> 21:16.420
And I'm going to do a segment about the wacky rally where Trump said crazy things and made

21:16.420 --> 21:19.680
up three words and said he endorsed a candidate who's named right.

21:19.680 --> 21:25.720
I'm crafting that in total to find a balance between let's build this audience as much

21:25.720 --> 21:31.840
as I can in order to have a bigger base, to get my message out there and include the more

21:31.840 --> 21:35.360
serious stuff with the hope that there's a little bit of something for everyone.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.560
And I'm finding a balance between those two sides of the spectrum.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.140
It's a deliberate thing.

21:41.140 --> 21:45.240
And I'm aware that if I were producing my show 50 years ago, the balance would probably

21:45.240 --> 21:48.320
be different and it would probably change again if we didn't.

21:48.320 --> 21:52.920
If the show was audio only rather than having all these video platforms, it would also be

21:52.920 --> 21:53.920
different.

21:53.920 --> 21:59.520
But it's a decision that's proactively made to try to get the best and most out of the

21:59.520 --> 22:01.160
hour that I'm creating every day.

22:01.160 --> 22:07.720
Well, it just feels like there's an entire machine by Twitter and journalism that wants

22:07.720 --> 22:10.000
to divide people.

22:10.000 --> 22:15.800
And the drama of that division, highlighting the partisan division, the drama of that division

22:15.800 --> 22:20.960
feels like it's a tension with objective clear thinking sometimes.

22:20.960 --> 22:26.040
So that's the, I worry that there's a drug to it.

22:26.040 --> 22:33.440
There's too much fun to mock ridiculous people on the other side.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.600
I think you're right about that.

22:36.080 --> 22:43.960
And the fact that that is true to me supports, I've talked with my audience about, you know,

22:43.960 --> 22:47.560
like the old food pyramid, which I guess was like wrong, but let's imagine that there was

22:47.560 --> 22:51.040
a pyramid that made sense on the bottom bread.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.520
I think like whole grains, maybe I don't remember.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.400
It's been a while.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.900
Junk food is at the very top.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.420
I'm very open with my audience.

23:00.420 --> 23:05.400
The vast majority of what I do is the top of that pyramid.

23:05.960 --> 23:13.040
And I tell people very openly, I don't consume a lot of the type of content I produce.

23:13.040 --> 23:19.760
And I think it's really important to, as a base, be doing critical thinking, epistemology,

23:19.760 --> 23:24.840
how do we believe the things we believe, basics about the world.

23:24.840 --> 23:30.060
After that, reading history, economics, philosophy, et cetera.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.380
After that, now we're getting into current events.

23:32.380 --> 23:42.060
I would mostly be looking at consuming primary source reporting, things like associated press,

23:42.060 --> 23:43.060
whatever.

23:43.060 --> 23:45.780
I know everybody will have a different list of what counts there.

23:45.780 --> 23:51.500
After that is when I say indulge in some of the commentary type stuff that I do.

23:51.500 --> 23:57.260
If you find that I'm thoughtful enough to make it into that, but I'm very open and really

23:57.300 --> 24:02.620
what I try to do on my show often is in being that at the top of the pyramid, tell people

24:02.620 --> 24:07.540
there's all this other stuff that should be forming your foundation that I hope you're

24:07.540 --> 24:09.780
consuming in addition to just watching me.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.100
And I'm very open with my audience about that.

24:12.100 --> 24:17.360
What about the shape, the dynamics, the characteristics of your audience?

24:17.360 --> 24:25.860
Is there some degree to which you're through mocking maybe Republicans that there's a,

24:25.940 --> 24:28.980
there's a lean to that audience and then you become captured by the audience.

24:28.980 --> 24:31.140
Do you worry about the audience capture?

24:31.140 --> 24:33.020
I worry about it.

24:33.020 --> 24:41.580
I'm relatively comfortable that it's not shaping the program to a great degree in the sense

24:41.580 --> 24:47.460
that at this point I have a pretty good sense of the things I can say that will upset what

24:47.460 --> 24:48.980
I might call my core audience.

24:48.980 --> 24:53.900
You know, one of the interesting things just to briefly go back to the Twitter thing was

24:54.020 --> 24:58.180
those people who were furious with me on Twitter and they contacted my advertisers and some

24:58.180 --> 25:04.660
advertisers dropped me and on and on and on, none of them are actually in my audience.

25:04.660 --> 25:07.300
None of them are regular consumers of my audience.

25:07.300 --> 25:11.380
They were kind of weaponized against me by people who said, Hey, look at this.

25:11.380 --> 25:15.380
The people who follow Candace Owens on Twitter, other than for their kind of shock value,

25:15.380 --> 25:17.340
they're not in my audience.

25:17.340 --> 25:20.820
And with my core audience, I know there are things I can talk about that will generate

25:20.820 --> 25:23.380
displeasure.

25:23.380 --> 25:27.220
I guess you could say with my audience, sometimes when I touch the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,

25:27.220 --> 25:28.860
that will happen.

25:28.860 --> 25:29.860
Sometimes on vaccines.

25:29.860 --> 25:36.100
There's a portion of my audience that is more generally skeptical of vaccines, sometimes

25:36.100 --> 25:43.380
on some foreign policy issues or, you know, I'm not a big fan of Marianne Williamson nor

25:43.380 --> 25:49.660
Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s challenges to Joe Biden, not because I love Joe Biden, but because

25:49.700 --> 25:51.860
I don't consider them to be the most serious challengers.

25:51.860 --> 25:53.700
I know there's people in my audience who don't like that.

25:53.700 --> 25:58.780
They get they get mad at me about that and I'm totally okay with that and that tension

25:58.780 --> 26:00.460
with with my core audience.

26:00.460 --> 26:06.300
So in that sense, I don't feel as though I've had that audience capture take place, but

26:06.300 --> 26:11.360
I know it can happen and I'm very open to being told ways in which it may be happening

26:11.360 --> 26:13.220
without me noticing.

26:13.220 --> 26:18.620
So I've made a call for questions on Reddit for this conversation.

26:18.620 --> 26:23.180
There's a lot of good questions that I'll probably bring up, but one of them was about

26:23.180 --> 26:31.620
Marianne Williamson asking why David thinks she is a garbage candidate, which of course

26:31.620 --> 26:35.860
I've never said, but perhaps you have more eloquently criticized.

26:35.860 --> 26:41.460
So let's go there to the 2024 election.

26:41.460 --> 26:44.660
So Biden, Joe Biden officially announced that he's running again.

26:44.660 --> 26:48.820
Donald Trump officially announced that he's running again.

26:48.820 --> 26:52.220
If that's the matchup, who do you think wins?

26:52.220 --> 26:56.100
If the elections held today, I think Biden.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.100
Why?

26:57.100 --> 27:00.800
Well, first of all, I believe he won last time.

27:00.800 --> 27:07.200
And if I start with the results from 2020 and I think to myself what has happened since

27:07.200 --> 27:12.800
then that would push or pull voters one way or the other, I have a hard time making a

27:12.800 --> 27:19.480
case that Trump is in a better position today than he was in November of 2020.

27:19.480 --> 27:24.120
So that's kind of my starting point, which is it's a rematch of an election with a known

27:24.120 --> 27:25.620
outcome.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.200
What has changed?

27:27.200 --> 27:33.040
And I can't make a case for circumstances having changed in Trump's favor.

27:33.040 --> 27:37.760
To give a couple of state level examples, Florida seems to be kind of moving more to

27:37.760 --> 27:44.160
the Republican side since 2020, but Trump won that state already in 2020.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.800
So it wouldn't really change the outcome.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.400
Arizona was close.

27:48.400 --> 27:53.800
I think Arizona has moved to the left since 2020, so I don't see Trump taking that one.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.140
Wisconsin, I think the same sort of thing applies.

27:56.140 --> 28:03.580
So being very like practical, that would be kind of the start of my reasoning.

28:03.580 --> 28:10.300
Do you think Joe Biden is a better candidate now than he was in 2020?

28:10.300 --> 28:14.060
I think he's a worse candidate.

28:14.060 --> 28:19.820
This is going to sound ageist, but I think he's a worse candidate in that he's even older

28:19.820 --> 28:26.620
and there already seems to be an appetite for younger candidates, particularly on the

28:26.620 --> 28:29.480
Democratic voting side.

28:29.480 --> 28:34.220
So he's going to be four years older and in a sense that could be a liability.

28:34.220 --> 28:38.500
However, he also is going to have four years of accomplishments.

28:38.500 --> 28:42.780
Now you might not like the things he's done, in which case that would hurt him, but he

28:42.780 --> 28:48.620
has started to accumulate a not insignificant number of accomplishments.

28:48.620 --> 28:53.620
Some of the big things that are known, Inflation Reduction Act and COVID stimulus, you know,

28:53.620 --> 28:58.220
but also less well known things like a bunch of little tweaks to health care, a bunch of

28:58.220 --> 29:00.020
little tweaks to student lending.

29:00.020 --> 29:04.420
There's been a lot of little things at the macro level.

29:04.420 --> 29:07.600
I don't actually think Joe Biden has that much to do with this.

29:07.600 --> 29:12.020
The same way I didn't credit or attack Trump for a lot of the macroeconomic stuff, but

29:12.020 --> 29:14.140
inflation has started to come down significantly.

29:14.140 --> 29:16.820
The stock market's quite steady.

29:16.820 --> 29:17.820
These sort of things.

29:17.860 --> 29:23.720
I think looking historically, it's a pretty okay environment for Joe Biden, with the exception

29:23.720 --> 29:28.820
that he was already the oldest president to be inaugurated in 2021 and he would beat his

29:28.820 --> 29:31.220
own record in January of 2025.

29:31.220 --> 29:33.820
And I just don't know how voters are going to see that.

29:33.820 --> 29:39.180
So in terms of just a public human being, how would you compare Trump and Biden?

29:39.180 --> 29:46.180
So if I were to give criticism towards Trump, it would be that he's chaotic, maybe to the

29:46.220 --> 29:50.940
point of being disrespectful to a lot of different groups, to a lot of different ideas, to a

29:50.940 --> 29:54.380
lot of different nations and leaders and all that kind of stuff.

29:54.380 --> 30:01.180
And then the criticism towards Biden would be that he, maybe perhaps because of age or

30:01.180 --> 30:08.180
any other kind of cognitive capabilities, is not really there mentally, in the way that

30:08.260 --> 30:11.140
perhaps you could say that Barack Obama was there.

30:11.140 --> 30:17.420
Just mentally being able to handle all kinds of aspects of being a public representative

30:17.420 --> 30:21.820
of a nation to the world and to the people of that nation.

30:21.820 --> 30:28.260
So which in the competition of personality flaws, which do you think is more powerful?

30:28.260 --> 30:35.260
You've laid out fair and I believe accurate assessments of elements of both of those men.

30:35.340 --> 30:36.540
Yeah.

30:36.540 --> 30:41.940
You haven't weighed in on to what degree you value each of those assessments, which is

30:41.940 --> 30:47.540
where I think the kind of meat of this question really is.

30:47.540 --> 30:52.260
I don't see, and I know that, you know, Biden's going to get us into World War Three, World

30:52.260 --> 30:55.020
War Three doesn't seem to be happening.

30:55.020 --> 31:01.060
I don't see the Biden deficits you listed, which I agree with you on.

31:01.100 --> 31:08.540
I don't see them as dangerous or threatening to the standing of the United States in this

31:08.540 --> 31:15.540
kind of environment with our Western traditional Western allies and geopolitics, et cetera,

31:15.720 --> 31:22.100
in the way that the sort of unhinged personality of Trump combined with his lack of knowledge

31:22.100 --> 31:25.820
about most issues is a threat.

31:25.820 --> 31:31.220
So for me, if those two are the candidates, Biden would be my choice.

31:31.220 --> 31:35.220
Now, are there people I would rather see on the Democratic side?

31:35.220 --> 31:36.220
Yes.

31:36.220 --> 31:40.180
If I knew the president would be a Republican, can I think of better options than Trump?

31:40.180 --> 31:41.180
Absolutely.

31:41.180 --> 31:46.640
You know, I think it's so funny when in 2012 it was Obama versus Romney, the difference

31:46.640 --> 31:49.940
seemed so significant between them.

31:49.940 --> 31:54.260
Thinking back, I'm sure I would disagree with Mitt Romney about tax rates and his views

31:54.260 --> 31:59.780
on LGBT or I'm sure I know are different than mine, but it seems without looking at

31:59.780 --> 32:04.840
him with rose colored glasses, so comparatively benign given the four years of Trump.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.500
So that's kind of where I come down.

32:06.500 --> 32:12.300
Even McCain and Obama, the differences seem quite drastic.

32:12.300 --> 32:13.300
Yeah.

32:13.300 --> 32:17.660
McCain was interesting because Palin as his running mate opened the door to the sort of

32:17.660 --> 32:21.820
cartoonish stuff that we've started to see on the Republican side.

32:21.860 --> 32:27.780
Palin, Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene, it started going in that direction, which has made the

32:27.780 --> 32:31.820
party a bit of a joke aside from what you believe the tax rate would be right.

32:31.820 --> 32:36.700
You can say taxes are too high, but Jewish space lasers come on, you know.

32:36.700 --> 32:39.660
So but but I agree with you on McCain also.

32:39.660 --> 32:44.040
So go back to the political terms we talked about what where in that spectrum do you place

32:44.040 --> 32:47.300
yourself today?

32:47.300 --> 32:50.100
Which of the label do you think captures your political views?

32:50.100 --> 32:54.340
I'm a massive social Democrat, which again is a capitalist.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.140
I own my own business.

32:56.140 --> 33:00.140
I pay the taxes I'm legally required to pay and not a penny more.

33:00.140 --> 33:01.980
And you know, all those things.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.380
That's where I place myself.

33:03.380 --> 33:05.900
Would you place yourself to the left of Joe Biden?

33:05.900 --> 33:06.900
Yes.

33:06.900 --> 33:07.900
Yes.

33:07.900 --> 33:11.700
Where does AOC fit into that?

33:11.700 --> 33:12.700
It's a good question.

33:12.700 --> 33:15.540
What do you think about AOC as a candidate?

33:15.540 --> 33:17.620
Do you think she eventually runs?

33:17.620 --> 33:25.020
I think that if she doesn't run into some kind of scandal, and I don't mean scandal

33:25.020 --> 33:32.660
in the sense of some personal impropriety that, you know, but I mean some kind of major

33:32.660 --> 33:39.460
political problem, it seems that she has the staying power to be an American elected politics

33:39.460 --> 33:40.820
for a long time.

33:40.820 --> 33:45.740
Whether she would even want to be president versus maybe going to the Senate or being

33:45.780 --> 33:47.180
governor or whatever the case may be.

33:47.180 --> 33:49.900
I have no idea what her ambitions are in that sense.

33:49.900 --> 33:59.420
But certainly like policy aside, she has this combination of charisma, likability to some,

33:59.420 --> 34:04.340
but also something about her personality that angers the people who don't like her in a

34:04.340 --> 34:11.700
way that only fuels her sort of presence, which I think applies to Trump as well.

34:11.700 --> 34:14.820
That I do think that she has the potential to be, to have significant staying power

34:14.820 --> 34:15.820
in American politics.

34:15.820 --> 34:16.820
President?

34:16.820 --> 34:17.820
I don't know.

34:17.820 --> 34:22.860
Do you think that's the future of political elections and politics in general?

34:22.860 --> 34:27.300
Is people who are able to skillfully piss off the other side like AOC and Trump did?

34:27.300 --> 34:29.020
I think it's an aspect of it.

34:29.020 --> 34:34.580
I think it's also understanding how to communicate policy ideas.

34:34.580 --> 34:38.780
Trump, you know, I have things I can praise Trump about if we want to get to that segment

34:38.780 --> 34:39.780
at some point.

34:39.780 --> 34:40.780
You let me know when that is.

34:40.940 --> 34:45.460
I do think that there are some things Trump is very good at, and this is why it's very

34:45.460 --> 34:50.620
hard for me to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it takes to actually fight Trump in a

34:50.620 --> 34:53.140
national primary.

34:53.140 --> 34:59.540
And one of those things is Trump has a, even though he often says very strange things that

34:59.540 --> 35:02.620
if you transcribe them, you go, that's what language is that?

35:02.620 --> 35:04.340
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

35:04.340 --> 35:11.500
In the moment, the way he relates to adversaries on stage, et cetera, is very good in that

35:11.500 --> 35:14.820
he is very much aware of how it is going to be seen by the audience.

35:14.820 --> 35:18.060
And so that's why a lot of times it's more about doesn't matter that a word salad came

35:18.060 --> 35:22.580
out of his mouth, how he immediately responded and related to the person who very good.

35:22.580 --> 35:28.540
So I think that knowing how to be good when clips are shared all the time, often out of

35:28.540 --> 35:31.840
context is extraordinarily important.

35:31.840 --> 35:36.520
Knowing how to use social media, which every election cycle, that means something different,

35:36.520 --> 35:39.560
but understanding how to use social media, very important.

35:39.560 --> 35:43.240
Those things are absolutely so important.

35:43.240 --> 35:49.200
And whether you're able to do a deep dive on the deficit, it's certainly useful, but

35:49.200 --> 35:50.680
I would say it's a bad thing.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.840
It's becoming less important in terms of figuring out who we want to represent us.

35:53.840 --> 35:59.400
So just lingering on the AOC and then maybe let's throw in Bernie Sanders on that.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.400
Yeah.

36:00.760 --> 36:05.640
So where do you place yourself and how do you do the layout of the land of Bernie Sanders,

36:05.640 --> 36:10.240
AOC, Joe Biden and David Pakman?

36:10.240 --> 36:13.820
My instinct is, and I'm going to answer it.

36:13.820 --> 36:20.680
The thing that makes this tough is Bernie says he's a democratic socialist.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.840
He ran as a social democrat.

36:22.840 --> 36:27.400
He didn't run on anything that was really socialism, right?

36:27.400 --> 36:30.600
So I'm going by their public facing platforms.

36:30.600 --> 36:34.800
I've been listening to him for many, many years and all the way back to the Tom Hartman

36:34.800 --> 36:40.680
show and I think using the terms as you've been using them, he has, I don't think ever

36:40.680 --> 36:42.920
been a democratic socialist.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.160
I haven't heard him speak about socialism.

36:46.160 --> 36:53.440
I think I've heard him speak about social programs and the value of social programs

36:53.520 --> 36:58.240
throughout the history of the United States and there and how they've been beneficial.

36:58.240 --> 37:02.080
My understanding is very similar to yours, although there may be stuff from the seventies

37:02.080 --> 37:06.200
where he really was talking about all that shit in the seventies.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.200
Yeah.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.200
You and I even who weren't around, we were doing stuff in the seventies.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.200
I feel like we did.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.200
Yeah.

37:11.200 --> 37:17.200
My sense would be, you know, Biden is like center left and then I'm to the left of that,

37:17.200 --> 37:22.800
but maybe just inside of where AOC and Bernie are very, very similar to Bernie.

37:22.800 --> 37:28.960
I mean, I identify with a lot of Bernie's ideas, maybe their implementation I'm more

37:28.960 --> 37:29.960
flexible on.

37:29.960 --> 37:33.600
I'll give you one example, Medicare for all.

37:33.600 --> 37:38.720
One way of trying to get healthcare to everybody, which Bernie's very big on is you take the

37:38.720 --> 37:42.880
current Medicare program, you just eliminate the age limit, make it available to everybody,

37:42.880 --> 37:44.920
pay for it through taxation.

37:44.920 --> 37:45.920
Interesting.

37:45.920 --> 37:52.200
However, I'm open to other models if they get everybody healthcare that is good quality

37:52.320 --> 37:53.520
and affordable.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.720
Singapore has an interesting model.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.400
Germany has an interesting model.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.400
I am.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.860
I am more agnostic about how we do it than just saying let's expand Medicare, whether

38:02.860 --> 38:04.960
that puts me to the right of Bernie.

38:04.960 --> 38:08.000
I don't, I don't know, but I'm not like exactly right there on.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.400
It has to be Medicare for all.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.400
Yeah.

38:10.400 --> 38:15.080
That's more of a, that's more just flexibility versus dogmatism.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.000
So I don't know if that puts you to the left or to the right.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
I don't either.

38:18.160 --> 38:24.960
What do you think about the term manipulation or the corruption in the DNC that perhaps

38:24.960 --> 38:28.000
tipped the scales against Bernie in the election?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Do you think there was such a thing?

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
In 2016 or 2020?

38:32.000 --> 38:39.480
Both, I would say in different, the dynamics there were different with Hillary Clinton

38:39.480 --> 38:43.440
and the pressure from Hillary Clinton as a candidate and so on.

38:43.440 --> 38:44.440
Yeah.

38:44.920 --> 38:50.000
Was there, why didn't Bernie win, I guess is one, one way to ask.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Okay.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.680
I think there's a couple of things here.

38:52.680 --> 38:57.840
First the DNC, I'm not a Democrat, just your audience may not know.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.160
I'm just a independent.

38:59.160 --> 39:00.160
Yeah.

39:00.160 --> 39:03.520
I mostly vote for candidates that end up being Democrats in local elections.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.120
Often there's no party designation.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.120
So okay.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.120
I'm obviously on the left.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.280
I'm not denying that, but the democratic party as an institution has never really been interesting

39:10.280 --> 39:11.280
to me.

39:11.440 --> 39:15.000
A rebel that resists belonging to any institution.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Exactly right.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Exactly right.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.560
And whether it matters, I don't know.

39:19.560 --> 39:26.640
The DNC and the RNC really are organizations that to some degree exist to justify their

39:26.640 --> 39:32.280
own existence because if they were no longer necessary, they would go away.

39:32.280 --> 39:36.760
And so they have to assert their value and their importance.

39:37.200 --> 39:43.560
in a number of different ways, organizing the way that the nominee is chosen, the convention,

39:43.560 --> 39:47.960
working with states on everything from redistricting to whatever else that case may be setting

39:47.960 --> 39:52.960
the order of primaries and having some involvement in how that's all going to happen.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.800
And also coordinating behind the scenes.

39:56.800 --> 40:02.520
I guess they would describe it as making sure our candidates don't get in each other's ways.

40:02.520 --> 40:07.400
We might see it and say they're picking the winner.

40:07.400 --> 40:11.200
There's nothing illegal about them being involved in picking the winner, but we might say it's

40:11.200 --> 40:12.920
not in people's interests.

40:12.920 --> 40:16.400
I think the 2020 primary was really interesting.

40:16.400 --> 40:23.480
Bernie supporter myself, I started telling my audience after a couple primaries and even

40:23.480 --> 40:30.480
before based on polling and different things, I see a real uphill battle here for Bernie.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.260
And it's really important.

40:32.260 --> 40:37.880
People in my audience are not the average union worker in Michigan who is mostly working

40:37.880 --> 40:41.640
and raising a family and then goes to vote on primary day and goes to vote on election

40:41.640 --> 40:42.640
day.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.640
If you spend a lot of time on Reddit and Twitter, you're going to have an inflated sense of

40:46.640 --> 40:50.600
Bernie's popularity within the Democratic Party.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.520
That was my sense.

40:52.520 --> 40:57.040
And to some degree, we saw that in certain states.

40:57.040 --> 41:01.500
I don't have the exact primary order and results in front of me or in my head.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.800
But the big turning point was South Carolina.

41:03.800 --> 41:10.560
South Carolina was when Joe Biden won and won handily, understood to be because of the

41:10.560 --> 41:14.360
larger African-American population in South Carolina.

41:14.360 --> 41:18.440
And right around that exact same time, I actually don't remember now whether it was the day

41:18.440 --> 41:22.480
after or the day before some of the smaller Democratic candidates, smaller in terms of

41:22.480 --> 41:27.360
support got out and said, I'm endorsing Joe Biden.

41:27.360 --> 41:32.920
And to some degree, of course, it was all organized and timed to help Joe Biden.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.560
There's no doubt about that.

41:34.560 --> 41:37.240
This is what the DNC does.

41:37.240 --> 41:44.200
It's hard for me to be mad at the DNC because this is sort of like if we believe they were

41:44.200 --> 41:48.820
there to be unbiased arbiters and to stay as much on the side as possible, it would

41:48.820 --> 41:53.940
make sense to be furious that they've gone against their stated kind of mandate.

41:53.940 --> 42:00.780
But we know that the DNC negotiates and is working behind the scenes and has a favorite.

42:00.780 --> 42:03.420
That favorite was Hillary in 2016, 2020.

42:03.420 --> 42:07.660
So I share the frustration about the power that the DNC has.

42:07.660 --> 42:11.940
But for people who were saying they did something illegal or whatever else the case may be,

42:11.940 --> 42:13.860
that doesn't seem to be the case.

42:13.860 --> 42:18.740
But this is part of why I mean, I would love there not to be this duopoly of Republicans

42:18.740 --> 42:20.100
and Democrats.

42:20.100 --> 42:23.840
And there's probably four major changes that have to happen in order to make that a reality.

42:23.840 --> 42:30.220
But I share the frustration of folks while recognizing that Reddit was not accurately

42:30.220 --> 42:32.660
representing Bernie's level of popularity.

42:32.660 --> 42:37.740
Still, I wish that the bias wasn't towards the what could be negatively termed a deep

42:37.740 --> 42:43.260
state towards the bureaucracy, towards the momentum of the past, which I think Joe Biden

42:43.260 --> 42:46.700
kind of represents versus new ideas.

42:46.900 --> 42:51.580
It's funny to say that Bernie Sanders somehow represents new ideas because he's also an

42:51.580 --> 42:52.580
older gentleman.

42:52.580 --> 42:54.060
Well, it's a frame.

42:54.060 --> 42:55.700
It's a lot of framing.

42:55.700 --> 43:02.380
And the other aspect to that is on paper, Joe Biden's platform was arguably the most

43:02.380 --> 43:06.700
progressive of any Democratic candidate who won the nomination.

43:06.700 --> 43:11.420
Now, of course, there were people who challenged the nominations who were to Joe Biden's left.

43:11.460 --> 43:13.860
A lot of this is perspective.

43:13.860 --> 43:18.380
And you know, that's how you end up saying the guy who's a couple of years older than

43:18.380 --> 43:22.320
Biden is actually the guy with the fresh perspective, which is interesting because I don't disagree

43:22.320 --> 43:23.320
with you.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.320
Yeah.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.780
And you also have to say the perspective doesn't always align with the policies.

43:27.780 --> 43:28.780
You're right.

43:28.780 --> 43:33.080
And you know, the actual policies of Joe Biden are different than maybe the perception of

43:33.080 --> 43:34.820
Joe Biden or what he ran on.

43:34.820 --> 43:39.980
I mean, just two examples I would give are during his campaign, he played up a little

43:39.980 --> 43:45.060
bit his interest in doing student loan forgiveness and something on cannabis.

43:45.060 --> 43:46.060
I never bought it.

43:46.060 --> 43:50.940
I told my audience, I think he's saying this stuff because this is the way the tide is

43:50.940 --> 43:54.300
kind of the wind is blowing and he's being advised to say this stuff.

43:54.300 --> 43:56.340
I don't think he's going to do very much on either of these things.

43:56.340 --> 44:02.020
He did actually do some student loan stuff, but that would be two examples, I think.

44:02.020 --> 44:08.780
OK, let's go to the something you alluded to, which is the pros and cons of a particular

44:08.780 --> 44:09.780
candidate.

44:10.580 --> 44:18.540
What to you as a critic of Trump, what to you are the pros, the strengths of Donald

44:18.540 --> 44:21.420
Trump and what to you are his biggest weaknesses?

44:21.420 --> 44:28.460
The strengths of Trump, see how I can frame them in a way that is both accurate and accurately

44:28.460 --> 44:33.140
assesses my feeling about it and can be taken out of context most masterfully through the

44:33.140 --> 44:34.140
clipping process.

44:34.620 --> 44:43.820
Yes, Trump's strengths are mostly superficial and in terms of presentation, Trump was able

44:43.820 --> 44:46.580
to I call it a grift.

44:46.580 --> 44:51.220
Some on the right say he's just so good at relating to different types of people.

44:51.220 --> 44:57.300
Trump as a rich guy from New York City was able to convince people that he spent most

44:57.300 --> 45:04.100
of his life trying to be kept isolated from, that he had their best interests in mind,

45:04.100 --> 45:12.020
that he knew why they weren't doing well in the 2016 economy and that he had solutions

45:12.020 --> 45:14.180
that he was going to bring forward.

45:14.180 --> 45:19.600
The truth is he never really liked those people and as soon as they weren't useful to him

45:19.600 --> 45:24.780
for a brief period of time, he you know that that love affair with his followers stopped

45:24.780 --> 45:27.140
and then now it's back that he needs them again.

45:27.140 --> 45:31.860
He didn't really understand the causes of the problems that those folks were experiencing

45:32.020 --> 45:33.620
and his solutions were laughable, right?

45:33.620 --> 45:37.720
Like Jared was going to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in year one.

45:37.720 --> 45:40.140
He was going to replace Obamacare in 2017.

45:40.140 --> 45:43.240
Things that were never going anywhere, anywhere.

45:43.240 --> 45:50.180
But what he did really well was he put up a united front of I know what is ailing you.

45:50.180 --> 45:53.020
I know how to fix it and I know how to fix it.

45:53.020 --> 45:59.100
I guess because he's a businessman and he's been above the fray of politics for so long,

45:59.100 --> 46:01.580
knowing how to use political donations to his advantage.

46:01.580 --> 46:02.580
He called that smart.

46:02.580 --> 46:03.580
Etc.

46:03.580 --> 46:04.580
I think that's his greatest strength.

46:04.580 --> 46:11.340
Why do you say that the the Jared plan for Israel-Palestine and the plan for health care

46:11.340 --> 46:12.340
to improve Obamacare?

46:12.340 --> 46:13.340
Why?

46:13.340 --> 46:14.860
Why do you say that's laughable?

46:14.860 --> 46:19.340
Well, only someone I would include the North Korea plan as well, which I'm glad to talk

46:19.340 --> 46:20.580
about.

46:20.580 --> 46:29.140
Only someone who doesn't know anything about the size and scope of these issues could so

46:29.140 --> 46:32.560
arrogantly say that they could solve them in that way.

46:32.560 --> 46:38.660
And on that time frame, I'm all for optimism and and bringing a new face to things.

46:38.660 --> 46:39.660
Absolutely.

46:39.660 --> 46:40.940
Without a doubt.

46:40.940 --> 46:47.020
But you know, a wall with Mexico that Mexico will pay for at the end of my first term.

46:47.020 --> 46:50.580
I know there are people who believed it because they would call into my show and say, I'm

46:50.580 --> 46:52.520
voting for Trump because of it.

46:52.520 --> 46:57.980
But it's hard to believe that anybody serious would fall for that unless you were deliberately

46:57.980 --> 47:02.580
wanting to just believe whatever was being fed to you or you just hadn't ever thought

47:02.580 --> 47:05.140
about these issues before the health care plan.

47:05.140 --> 47:11.100
You know, in 2017, they proposed one would have led to 24 million or so people ending

47:11.100 --> 47:12.100
up without health care.

47:12.100 --> 47:14.120
Didn't go anywhere because it was so terrible.

47:14.120 --> 47:18.660
And then in August of 2020, Trump said in two weeks, I'm going to finally have my health

47:18.660 --> 47:20.220
care proposal.

47:20.220 --> 47:21.220
It's 2023.

47:21.220 --> 47:22.260
We still never got it.

47:22.260 --> 47:26.580
You know, with all of these things, when you think them through, it was just sort of arrogance.

47:26.620 --> 47:31.300
And I get the perspective of I want optimism and I liked that optimism.

47:31.300 --> 47:32.300
It worked.

47:32.300 --> 47:33.300
I mean, fair.

47:33.300 --> 47:34.740
A lot of people saw it and liked it.

47:34.740 --> 47:40.260
As someone who followed a lot of those issues closely, they seemed, of course, like impossible

47:40.260 --> 47:41.260
promises.

47:41.260 --> 47:42.260
What's the double edged sword?

47:42.260 --> 47:48.540
So to push back a little bit, if you look at the things I have a little bit more knowledge

47:48.540 --> 47:54.140
about, which is the space of artificial intelligence, there's a company called DeepMind and there's

47:54.140 --> 47:59.220
a company called OpenAI that were laughed at for a long time when they were talking

47:59.220 --> 48:01.900
about that they're going to solve intelligence.

48:01.900 --> 48:08.220
And now they've made, especially DeepMind, and now most recently OpenAI with GPT, they've

48:08.220 --> 48:14.660
made progress that most of the community would not have imagined they'd be able to make.

48:14.660 --> 48:21.180
Everything from AlphaGo beating the WorldGo champion, just all the different steps in

48:21.180 --> 48:24.660
progress they can get into were a surprise to everybody.

48:24.660 --> 48:33.740
And they are legitimately, fearlessly pursuing the task of solving intelligence.

48:33.740 --> 48:41.140
The other aspect, he gets a lot of criticism now, but another example is Elon Musk.

48:41.140 --> 48:45.940
I can say a lot of things like SpaceX, so commercial space flight.

48:45.940 --> 48:49.780
He was laughed at for a long time that that's possible.

48:49.780 --> 48:53.020
Same thing with autopilot and Tesla, autonomous vehicles.

48:53.020 --> 48:58.780
His approach was harshly criticized by all the experts and still criticized, to this

48:58.780 --> 49:00.620
day deeply criticized.

49:00.620 --> 49:06.460
And I as a person that I believe objectively can look at the progress of autopilot as a

49:06.460 --> 49:11.580
semi-autonomous vehicle system has been incredibly surprising.

49:11.580 --> 49:17.460
So the reason I mention that is sometimes it feels like you need the guy or the gal

49:17.940 --> 49:26.020
who makes those preposterous, ambitious statements like we're going to solve health care this

49:26.020 --> 49:29.020
year.

49:29.020 --> 49:35.740
And then there's experts like yourself that are looking, thinking, have you read anything

49:35.740 --> 49:37.740
about the history of Israel-Palestine?

49:37.740 --> 49:40.380
Is a good example of that.

49:40.380 --> 49:42.660
Do you know there's a history there?

49:42.660 --> 49:47.300
Do you realize how complicated, how many people have tried, how many people have failed, how

49:47.300 --> 49:53.940
many millions of people hate each other in this in this little place, in this in this

49:53.940 --> 49:54.940
land?

49:54.940 --> 49:58.260
Like sometimes the expertise can really weigh you down.

49:58.260 --> 50:03.620
So sort of to push back, sometimes you have to have the almost be naive and stupid and

50:03.620 --> 50:07.820
just rush in with an optimism in order to actually make some progress.

50:07.820 --> 50:09.380
I agree with you 100 percent.

50:09.380 --> 50:14.540
I think it's interesting that all of the examples you gave of successes are from the technology

50:14.540 --> 50:15.540
space.

50:15.540 --> 50:16.540
Not politics.

50:16.540 --> 50:20.700
Not from politics, which I mean, listen, I would love to be able to make headway on

50:20.700 --> 50:22.820
some of these issues more quickly without a doubt.

50:22.820 --> 50:27.060
I do think at some point, though, when it comes down to voting and saying one of these

50:27.060 --> 50:31.780
people is going to be ostensibly in charge for four years through all of the departments

50:31.780 --> 50:37.060
and secretaries and choices that they make, we do want to apply some level of realism

50:37.060 --> 50:41.020
with the with the understanding that your examples are from the tech space and they're

50:41.020 --> 50:42.020
good examples.

50:42.020 --> 50:43.620
There's there's no question about it.

50:43.780 --> 50:48.540
The thing I'll add to this, I recently read Bradley Hope's new book about North Korea

50:48.540 --> 50:53.900
and it's really about an activist who doesn't even really matter.

50:53.900 --> 50:59.340
But the in the background of the book, it's written much of what is written about happens

50:59.340 --> 51:04.060
during the Trump era and when Trump did the first and then the second, I guess you'd call

51:04.060 --> 51:06.460
them summits with Kim Jong Un.

51:06.460 --> 51:12.780
And it actually did seem like to some degree, Trump's we're going to handle this like I

51:12.780 --> 51:16.300
do a business deal approach to Kim Jong Un.

51:16.300 --> 51:23.900
In some sense, it actually was logical because of Kim Jong Un and the way that it was so

51:23.900 --> 51:28.940
ego driven and they both as sort of authoritarian strongmen types to different degrees wanted

51:28.940 --> 51:34.420
that there was actually a kernel where I actually thought as I read it, Trump's initial idea

51:34.420 --> 51:35.420
wasn't crazy.

51:35.420 --> 51:38.180
The problem was he knew nothing about the backstory of the relationship.

51:38.180 --> 51:42.900
He fell for all sorts of lies from Kim Jong Un and he made offers that didn't make any

51:42.900 --> 51:43.900
sense to me.

51:43.900 --> 51:44.900
It fell apart.

51:44.900 --> 51:45.900
Fine.

51:45.900 --> 51:50.140
But that's an example where I think Trump's personality was not actually at its base.

51:50.140 --> 51:52.500
The problem when it came to North Korea.

51:52.500 --> 51:57.060
Well, there's other things of this nature that could go and some people argue goes into

51:57.060 --> 51:59.740
the strengths and pros of Donald Trump.

51:59.740 --> 52:02.820
China, for example, tariffs on China.

52:02.820 --> 52:08.100
Can you make the case that there's some positive outcomes of the way Donald Trump?

52:08.100 --> 52:09.100
Acted with China.

52:09.100 --> 52:10.500
It's really tough.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.500
And I'll give you a couple.

52:11.500 --> 52:12.500
Okay.

52:12.500 --> 52:13.500
Then also cons.

52:13.500 --> 52:14.500
I'll give you.

52:14.500 --> 52:15.500
It's tough to make.

52:15.500 --> 52:16.740
So the China thing is really.

52:16.740 --> 52:23.260
So just very recently to when we're recording this, Trump was on Fox News interviewed by

52:23.260 --> 52:29.200
a guy named Mark Levin and Trump proposed a new, I call it a conspiracy theory.

52:29.200 --> 52:33.980
Maybe it will strike you as something different about China, COVID and tariffs.

52:33.980 --> 52:39.180
And Trump's suggestion was that the tariffs cost China so much money.

52:39.180 --> 52:45.780
China sent the U.S. so much money in tariffs that they released COVID as punishment.

52:45.780 --> 52:47.980
Now there's a couple problems with that.

52:47.980 --> 52:51.980
One American companies pay the tariffs.

52:51.980 --> 52:53.820
Trump still doesn't seem to know this.

52:53.820 --> 52:59.740
Trump seems to believe that when he puts a tariff on Chinese imports, someone in China

52:59.740 --> 53:02.940
is cutting a check to the United States.

53:02.940 --> 53:07.540
American companies buy the stuff from China and then American companies cut a check to

53:07.540 --> 53:10.500
the United States for the tariff.

53:10.500 --> 53:14.300
Trump doesn't seem to get that, but it still has a sting to the Chinese economy.

53:14.300 --> 53:19.200
You can make the argument that if there is a suitable alternative domestically or from

53:19.200 --> 53:24.020
a different country that it will reduce imports, but it didn't happen.

53:24.020 --> 53:30.440
And we actually have reports now that the tariffs on China cost about a quarter million

53:30.440 --> 53:32.520
American jobs.

53:32.520 --> 53:39.160
The other problem with that idea is China created and released a virus in order to hurt

53:39.160 --> 53:41.160
you.

53:41.160 --> 53:46.720
But as of today, 5.7 of the 6.8 million deaths were in other countries.

53:46.720 --> 53:48.640
It's a very indirect way.

53:48.640 --> 53:52.760
You're mostly killing people in other countries to hurt Trump.

53:52.760 --> 53:57.560
Maybe there was a, this is the sort of thing where when I think about how Trump dealt with

53:57.560 --> 54:04.000
China, it's very scary because given another four years, who knows what he might do if

54:04.000 --> 54:06.720
he still doesn't understand how tariffs work.

54:06.720 --> 54:13.960
The geopolitics operates in complicated ways with carrots and sticks and Henry Kissinger

54:13.960 --> 54:16.200
has written quite a lot about this.

54:16.200 --> 54:23.040
In some sense, the positive aspect here that Donald Trump is willing to take big risks

54:23.800 --> 54:30.240
in the game of geopolitics with this giant superpower that is China and a lot of others

54:30.240 --> 54:37.800
are too afraid, too afraid to call them out, to come to the table and criticize.

54:37.800 --> 54:42.320
I certainly think that's an argument that can be made.

54:42.320 --> 54:47.820
My question would be what tangible positive outcomes did it lead to?

54:47.820 --> 54:51.160
And it's tough to identify any, but I think it's a great thing.

54:51.160 --> 54:57.400
I mean, listen, one of the things you're kind of getting at, maybe indirectly, is that there's

54:57.400 --> 55:02.080
been this sense that politics has been done very similarly for a long time.

55:02.080 --> 55:07.120
And even between Democrats and Republicans, still, even with some policy differences,

55:07.120 --> 55:12.360
there's still the kind of feeling that it's disconnected folks in DC mostly dealing with

55:12.360 --> 55:14.480
issues that don't directly affect.

55:14.480 --> 55:15.480
I get that.

55:15.480 --> 55:16.480
I'm with you on that.

55:16.480 --> 55:22.240
I think the question as to whether Trump's bluster was positive rather than extraordinarily

55:22.240 --> 55:27.440
humiliating in many ways, I just come down on it was an absolute and total humiliation.

55:27.440 --> 55:32.440
But I understand that you can recognize Trump doesn't know a lot of stuff, but his attitude

55:32.440 --> 55:34.320
was refreshing in some way.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.960
That's a reasonable position for someone to take.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.320
I disagree with it, but I understand it.

55:38.320 --> 55:42.180
But it's trying and failing better than not trying.

55:42.180 --> 55:44.120
This goes well beyond politics.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.480
You know, Wayne Gretzky is weighed in about this.

55:46.480 --> 55:47.480
Michael Jordan is weighed in.

55:47.480 --> 55:49.360
I mean, this is yeah.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.320
Is it better to have tried and failed than never?

55:51.320 --> 55:54.320
Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved?

55:54.320 --> 55:55.320
I don't know.

55:55.320 --> 55:58.080
I mean, listen, we live through four years of Trump.

55:58.080 --> 56:02.000
We know what that four year term was like.

56:02.000 --> 56:08.900
And it's very hard for me to say that the things he tried were were overwhelmingly reasonable.

56:08.900 --> 56:11.720
But I get the point you're trying to make and I appreciate it.

56:11.960 --> 56:14.400
If we don't do any of it, then where do we end up?

56:14.400 --> 56:15.400
Sure.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.720
We know where we ended up with with Trump and it was pretty embarrassing.

56:17.720 --> 56:22.280
OK, let's linger on some more strengths.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.660
We didn't start any new wars.

56:24.660 --> 56:26.520
We didn't start something to that.

56:26.520 --> 56:28.240
Yeah, that's it's it's interesting.

56:28.240 --> 56:31.880
There's a few different approaches to dealing with that.

56:31.880 --> 56:37.720
First, it's really important to remember that the counterpoint to that from the folks who

56:37.720 --> 56:41.360
like to say that was that Hillary Clinton was going to start three wars.

56:41.600 --> 56:42.940
Sometimes they say four wars.

56:42.940 --> 56:44.920
Sometimes they say five wars.

56:44.920 --> 56:50.920
OK, the geopolitical situation during the four years that Trump was in office, I don't

56:50.920 --> 56:56.000
know that they obviously lent themselves to wars that Trump just barely was able to keep

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
us out of.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.920
I think the Russia thing is interesting because now it's very popular to go back and say,

57:02.920 --> 57:07.680
you know, the reason Putin didn't do the Ukraine thing when Trump, right, and to somehow give

57:07.680 --> 57:10.040
Trump credit for that.

57:10.040 --> 57:15.560
There's a counterpoint to it, which is Putin under Trump, particularly if Trump got four

57:15.560 --> 57:20.600
more years, would have been able to maybe consolidate power in other ways because of

57:20.600 --> 57:21.680
his relationship with Trump.

57:21.680 --> 57:23.560
I'm not coming down on one side or the other.

57:23.560 --> 57:28.120
It's not my area of expertise, but it's not the open, shut, slam dunk that, you know,

57:28.120 --> 57:29.120
Trump likes to say it is.

57:29.120 --> 57:32.120
Putin didn't invade because he knew I would crush him.

57:32.120 --> 57:38.680
OK, so it's not obvious to me that there were imminently wars that would have started during

57:38.680 --> 57:39.680
that time.

57:39.680 --> 57:48.800
That being said, you know, for all the criticism of Obama during Crimea, Trump seemed to just

57:48.800 --> 57:52.520
kind of forget about that after all the criticism and say, I'm not actually going to do anything

57:52.520 --> 57:53.520
about that.

57:53.520 --> 57:58.880
And so there's there are foreign policy criticisms that that could be made, but it is true.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.100
No new wars were started under Trump.

58:01.100 --> 58:02.200
And I like that.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.200
I don't like wars.

58:03.200 --> 58:05.800
What do you think about his handling of covid?

58:05.800 --> 58:09.840
Can you say what are the pros and cons of his handling of covid?

58:09.840 --> 58:14.440
The con for him is he'd be president right now if he had handled it differently.

58:14.440 --> 58:18.700
I think it's abundantly clear early on.

58:18.700 --> 58:21.800
And there's now a lot of really good reporting about the conversations he was having with

58:21.800 --> 58:23.900
Jared Kushner and others.

58:23.900 --> 58:28.120
He became convinced either because of things he was being told or because he decided this

58:28.120 --> 58:29.480
is the way it's going to be.

58:29.480 --> 58:30.680
This is going to go away.

58:30.680 --> 58:31.680
Fine.

58:31.680 --> 58:32.680
It's in China.

58:32.680 --> 58:33.680
OK, it's in China and Italy.

58:33.840 --> 58:36.720
OK, we have 15 cases, but it'll soon be zero.

58:36.720 --> 58:40.280
Will be opened by Easter of 2020.

58:40.280 --> 58:42.680
None of it happened.

58:42.680 --> 58:47.760
If he had handled it in the following way, and I've said this to Rogan and I've said

58:47.760 --> 58:52.800
this to Patrick, but David and they tend to all see my side of this.

58:52.800 --> 58:59.760
If Trump had said, listen, we don't know how bad this is going to be, but I care too much

58:59.760 --> 59:02.640
about the American people to take a shot.

59:02.640 --> 59:04.480
So it's not going to be two weeks.

59:04.480 --> 59:07.480
It's going to be a little bit, but I need your help.

59:07.480 --> 59:08.960
We're going to bring everybody together.

59:08.960 --> 59:11.060
I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican.

59:11.060 --> 59:15.080
We're going to have MAGA masks and he could have kept 50 cents on the dollar to pay off

59:15.080 --> 59:17.020
Stormy or whoever, right?

59:17.020 --> 59:24.280
But it would have been, I think he wins reelection because the perception was and reality is

59:24.280 --> 59:25.520
a version of that.

59:25.520 --> 59:31.280
The perception was that he was way too cavalier about it early on.

59:31.760 --> 59:34.080
People died who didn't need to die.

59:34.080 --> 59:41.960
And I think that it was arguably the one area where he could have all but guaranteed that

59:41.960 --> 59:43.440
he was going to get himself reelected.

59:43.440 --> 59:47.440
Well, to push back on that, I mean, because you mentioned sort of masks and lockdowns

59:47.440 --> 59:49.480
kind of a solution to COVID.

59:49.480 --> 59:52.400
I didn't mention lockdowns, but I'm glad to talk about policy.

59:52.400 --> 59:53.400
Sure.

59:53.400 --> 59:54.400
Quarantine.

59:54.400 --> 01:00:00.080
There's several solutions to a pandemic, broadly speaking, and one of them is vaccine.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:05.000
Yeah, so you didn't mention that he fast-tracked the development.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.680
He his administration fast-tracked the development of the vaccine, which surprising he didn't

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.400
really take much credit for.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400
I think he did.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400
I think he tried.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400
There's a couple.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400
There's a lot there.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.880
Well, to me, it seems like you could make the case with the Trump hand gestures that

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:29.280
his decisions for fast-tracking the development of the vaccine saved tens of millions of lives.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.480
You can make you.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.560
He could in the Trumpian way, make that case.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.760
So a couple different things.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:39.880
I know you don't necessarily follow Trump's rallies as closely as I do, and I'm jealous

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.080
of you for that.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:50.080
But he did tout the vaccine stuff hugely for a while until his audience turned against

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080
him.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.080
And then he had to draw this line where he was going.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.640
I made the vaccines, which none of you have to take, by the way, freedom.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.000
You don't have to take them, but it's fantastic and nobody else could have done it.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But don't worry.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.320
Nobody's going to make you take the vaccine.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.200
And he actually got booed at a couple of his own rallies when talking about the vaccines.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.840
But let's back up a little bit fast-tracking.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.960
My understanding of what he did is he did what any president in his situation would

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.920
do and what many world leaders elsewhere did as well, which is he agreed to pre-purchase

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.140
supply of vaccine in order to provide money to pharmaceutical companies to scale up the

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:30.580
manufacturing, which is absolutely fine.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:33.540
But he wants one of the stories he tells us.

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.580
It usually takes 12 years to develop a vaccine.

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.420
We did it in nine months.

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:45.100
Thanks to me, decades of MRNA technology being developed created the platform in which you

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.620
can make a particular vaccine in nine months.

01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.440
Didn't have anything to do with Trump.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:56.020
He did pre-fund and say we will buy huge supply and that provided liquidity to the pharmaceutical

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.020
companies.

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:06.540
He obligated control to experts that enable that kind of fast-tracking of vaccines, right?

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:10.460
He was very eager for the FDA to approve it because he saw that there would be a political

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.460
benefit.

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.460
He didn't get in the way, I guess.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.460
He didn't get in the way.

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.460
Fair.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.460
I think now we're on the same page.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:19.780
He did not get in the way of vaccines being developed, which is good.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:24.580
Presidents and bureaucracies have a way of getting in the way.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.060
I don't disagree with that.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.540
I'm not aware of really any governments that got in the way.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:34.260
I mean, it seemed given the global situation, everybody, European countries were pre-purchasing

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.260
vaccine.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:40.220
African countries who were going to be later to receive vaccines were partnering with the

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.920
European countries that had pre-purchased.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:46.520
But the most interesting thing about all of this is Trump did play up the vaccines for

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:51.140
a long time until his crowd didn't want to hear about it anymore, which was crazy.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:56.380
It was sort of like he became a victim of the monster he created to some degree.

01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:01.060
One of the effects of all this that makes me truly sad is this division over the vaccines

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:03.500
has created distrust in science.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:11.740
And also what makes me sad is the scientific leaders, Anthony Fauci being one of the representatives

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.900
of that community, I would say completely dropped the ball.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.140
In what way?

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:24.820
They spoke with arrogance, they spoke down to people, they spoke in a way that a great

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:32.060
scientist does not speak, which is they spoke with certainty, without humility, like they

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:36.340
have all the wisdom and all of us are too dumb to understand it, but they're going

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:41.660
to be the parent that tells us exactly what to do versus speaking to the immensity of

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:46.740
the problem, the deep core of the problem being the uncertainty.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.500
We don't know what to do.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.500
The terrifying thing about the pandemic, we don't know anything about it as it's happening.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:58.060
And so you have to make decisions, you have to take risks about, well, maybe you have

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.060
to overreact in order to protect the populace.

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:08.020
But it's in the face of uncertainty that you have to do that, not empowered by science

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:14.780
somehow and the deep expertise that somebody like Anthony Fauci claims to have.

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:21.660
I'm really troubled by the distress in science that resulted from that.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.220
You have to blame the leaders to the degree.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:30.100
Leaders take responsibility, and I think Anthony Fauci was the scientific leader behind the

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:36.660
American response to the pandemic, and I think he failed as a scientist, as a representative

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.660
of science.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:44.700
I'm less I don't know if interested is the right word, but the kind of the the Fauci

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:50.460
review is less interesting to me in terms of what comes next than the first part you

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.700
mentioned, which is the distrust in science.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:59.020
And sometimes I'll get voicemails or emails from people in my audience who say that I

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:03.660
have had to backpedal on certain things related to this.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:09.660
And one of the things I tried to do from the beginning was not speak in certain terms when

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:11.500
we really didn't have complete information.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:16.900
So there was this period where hydroxychloroquine was first sort of mentioned as a possible

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:22.860
treatment prophylactic or, you know, proactive treatment for covid or active treatment for

01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:25.020
covid, along with a bunch of other stuff.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:30.540
There was ivermectin, there was vitamin D, there were all sorts of different things.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:37.100
And I tried to be careful to say right now we don't have rigorous science that tells

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.020
us that some of these things work.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:43.420
It doesn't mean that won't come in the future, at which point, if there was something as

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:49.100
cheap as hydroxychloroquine that treated covid effectively, unbelievable, fantastic.

01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:52.180
It's not there's no way it ever will be determined.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.260
We don't have that information right now, so it's not super wise right now to go and

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.060
start taking this stuff.

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:03.700
We eventually learned, like with vitamin D, having an appropriate vitamin D level does

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:10.340
seem to be based on what I most recently read, generally protective and a good thing when

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.180
it comes to infections of different.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.180
Great.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.980
OK, so that one we figured out.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:20.340
One of the really difficult things is that the quote truth about the vaccines did change

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:24.820
and the original again, this is all I don't pretend to be an expert, but just someone

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:28.820
who's synthesizing the medical data and writing about it.

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:37.500
Originally, the first vaccine related to the wild type strain did seem to be very effective

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:42.500
not only at preventing death and serious illness, but also transmission.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:47.300
There were people then saying it doesn't prevent transmission over time.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:52.960
As the variants came forward, the vaccine became less effective at that.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.640
At that point, I started telling my audience something different because as far as I was

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.520
concerned, the reality on the ground had changed in my mind.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.520
That's how science works.

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.520
It's not backpedaling.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.040
It's we're adjusting our beliefs to what is taking place in the real world.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:13.320
Well, to be fair, the scientists, many of whom are my friends, virologists and biologists,

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.920
they have way more humility than people like Anthony Fauci who was speaking about this or

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.400
the CEO of Pfizer who were speaking about this.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:27.040
That's the fundamental problem here is the way science works is there's usually a lot

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:35.040
more humility and a lot more transparency about what we know, what we don't know.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:39.800
People like Anthony Fauci thought it would be beneficial for the world if he speaks with

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:45.480
more certainty, but because of the political division that formed around that, that certainty

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.760
resulted in became completely counterproductive, that people didn't trust anything about the

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:56.160
vaccine, didn't trust any institutions there were that contained the experts that actually

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.120
knew what they were doing and basically didn't trust anything that was coming out of the

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:05.240
mouths of scientists, some large percent of the population.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:12.640
That made you completely ineffective at scale as a society trying to respond to a terrible

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:13.920
pandemic.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.520
That's where I put a lot of blame on leaders.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:22.600
Political leaders and scientific leaders are the ones that should inspire us to all get

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.920
together and respond.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:29.920
That should be the case for the pandemic, that should be the case in a time of war,

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.280
all this kind of stuff.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.640
I generally agree with you and for me, it's really about shared blame and there were a

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.840
lot of different reasons why the early communication wasn't good.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.800
I mean, for me, I prefer accuracy rather than overconfidence.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:51.560
I would prefer, listen, we don't really know right now whether masks do X or Y.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.240
What we do know is the supply is really limited of this type of mask.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.360
We're going to try to keep them for the frontline workers.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.560
I love that.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.880
That's the way I want to be communicated to.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.720
A call was made to do it differently, which was to say the masks don't actually help,

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.440
but the real reason is they want to keep them for healthcare workers.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.360
And then later the masks are what's going to solve.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.000
I'm with I'm with you 100 percent.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.800
I think the other layer to it is you can't ignore the political situation at the time.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:24.840
If Trump had one reelection and the vaccine distribution had taken place while Trump was

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:30.360
president rather than Biden, my belief is that the same number of Democrats would have

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.800
gotten vaccinated, but way more Republicans would have as well because they were following

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.880
not science, but political leaders.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:41.040
And when it was Biden in D.C. instead of Trump, a lot of those people said, I don't trust

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.040
the vaccine.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.360
But wait, it's Trump's vaccine.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.680
I thought, yeah, but something about the way Biden's distributing it.

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.400
So I do think you can't ignore that political layer.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:50.400
I agree with you.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.400
The communication was a disaster.

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.760
Let me ask you about Joe Biden.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.480
What are the strengths of weaknesses of Joe Biden weaknesses?

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.600
I think are some of the things you've identified.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.640
He is not seen as high energy.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:12.560
He is not the same Joe Biden that debated Paul Ryan in 2012 and ran circles around him

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:16.600
and just an incredible debate performance.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:24.680
He is not inspiring in the way that someone like a Barack Obama was to people coming up

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.840
and starting to get interested in politics.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.120
I think a lot of those are fair criticisms.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:35.880
I think on policy, he's not interested in a lot of the things that younger voters are

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880
interested in.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.400
I mentioned cannabis reform.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.280
I mentioned student loans.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.580
So I think that that's a deficit for Biden.

01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:53.440
I think the upside to Biden is when it comes to foreign policy, diplomacy, high level negotiations,

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.660
knowing how to engage with allies in a productive way, it's tough to find someone with more

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.140
experience than Biden.

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.420
I know that there are counterpoints to what I'm saying, and those include that was the

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:05.420
old Biden.

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.820
The new Biden doesn't have it.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.500
That includes that's just a sign of rot because he's been around for so long.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.220
Nobody should be around that long in politics.

01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:15.660
Perfectly reasonable criticisms to talk about.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.840
But I do see that as one of his strengths.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:25.460
And he also is good at knowing when he can work with Republicans and when he can't and

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:31.020
not wasting more time than is sort of expected for posturing reasons.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.340
And I think that that's a good thing.

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.600
Do you think he's actually there?

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.380
So in a day to day operation of government, given his cognitive capabilities, do you think

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:44.140
he is an active and practicing executive?

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:50.500
I don't know that I can say that it's because of what may be going on cognitively, but my

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:58.740
sense from the people I talk to is that he's very much involved in the highest level geopolitical

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:04.660
and big domestic economic stuff, but that a lot of the smaller issues that presidents

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:09.820
might or might not be in sort of plugged into that he's not plugged into the details of

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.220
a lot of the lower level stuff.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:15.340
I mean, you could probably apply the same exact criticism even more so towards the Donald

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:21.700
Trump administration in terms of being a practicing, active executive who's paying attention.

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:30.380
For example, Vladimir Putin is somebody who loves the role of the executive, has a huge

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:35.180
amount of meetings, is constantly tracking information about agriculture and all the

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:38.180
different subsystems of government.

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.100
Stalin, funny enough, was also extremely good at this.

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:48.820
So certain people just love the job of being an executive and I'm not sure if Donald Trump

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:57.260
did and I'm not sure if Joe Biden in his current state has the cognitive capability to.

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.260
It's a good question.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:02.740
Kim Jong Un is another one, by the way, you know, there's videos of him examining a pottery,

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:07.900
you know, a factory where they make plates and making very specific comments about how

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:08.940
the plates should be made.

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:12.580
I think that in that case, there's a lot of propaganda value to it.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:17.100
With Trump, I think you're probably right, you know, he did get involved in the minutiae

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.100
of things.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:22.780
I mean, once he pulled out a weather map and with a Sharpie drew a different hurricane path

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.020
that was more politically convenient to him.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.140
That's pretty micro, you know, saying the weather channel is wrong.

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.140
I see what you did there.

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.140
This is OK.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:31.140
I see that's a micro.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:35.220
He went to Puerto Rico and he gave out paper towels after a hurricane.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.340
Now he was shooting them like free throws, which didn't look very good.

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:42.100
So he will get involved in the micro when it's advantageous.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.100
You know what I mean?

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.740
But I do agree with you that he wants to just kind of make it so.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:46.740
Build the wall.

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:47.740
I don't know.

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:48.740
Just build it.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:49.740
Figure it out.

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:50.740
Get it done.

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:51.740
Quick pause.

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:52.740
Bath and break.

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:53.740
Sure.

01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:54.740
You're hilarious.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:59.460
And just for the sake of completeness, I should mention the subreddit would Biden has done.

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:03.540
There's also what Trump has done, but it's not as active and it has like this master

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.540
list of all the accomplishments.

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:12.780
I recommend people look at it because there's a kind of rigorous and interesting with links

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:19.980
list of all the things he's done just to list some of them restored daily press briefings,

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:24.340
cancel the Keystone pipeline, reverse Trump's Muslim ban, required masks on federal property,

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:29.500
rejoins the Paris climate agreement, extend student loan payment, freeze, extend eviction

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:35.500
freeze, historic stimulus bill, as you mentioned, and it's funny for border wall and so on.

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:41.460
And so forth DACA border strengthening of DACA rejoins the World Health Organization

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:44.780
and the timing of this, of course, is important.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:51.180
Yeah, several historic stimulus bills, which, of course, you could criticize or support.

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:56.620
Raise the minimum wage for federal contractors and federal employees for $15.

01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.620
There's a lot.

01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.620
There's a lot.

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:05.700
It makes you realize with both Trump and Biden that there's a bunch of small details that

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:06.700
matter.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:07.700
Yeah.

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:11.420
Like that matter on people's lives, like actual little policies.

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:17.420
Trump did a lot of stuff as far as I heard for the military, like not big stuff, but

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:18.420
small stuff.

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:19.420
Yeah.

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:21.420
I'd be curious what you're thinking of.

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.660
I mean, I know one of the big things under Trump was we're going to get trans people

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.260
out of the military.

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.260
That's not what I was referring to.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.900
I'm referring to that.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.780
Uh, he, Trump that tell, you know, Trump's hilarious with these stories that he tells.

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:37.460
And one of the story, and you get to know them if you, if you follow him at all, he

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:41.940
tells the story, you know, when I came into office, the generals came to me and they said,

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.420
sir, the cupboards are bare.

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.020
We have no bullets.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:48.980
And so I rebuilt the military, you know, the cupboards were bare when Obama left it and

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.380
it was just terrible, but I rebuilt it and the generals, I've got the best generals.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.620
They said, sir, it's incredible what you were able to do.

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.460
You look into it and it's like, yeah, that's not really true.

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:01.020
It is true that there are armaments that just like on a schedule do get replaced.

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.540
And that's part of the military industrial complex, but there's nothing like special

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:05.540
Trump really did.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:09.540
But these stories become, they take on like a life of their own.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:12.940
And it's interesting to sometimes try to dig down and figure out like, was there any policy

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.940
connected to that?

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:14.940
Or is that just a story?

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:19.460
Do you think it's possible to have a good conversation with each of them, Donald Trump

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:24.060
and Joe Biden in a pot in a podcast context or in a debate context?

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.060
Absolutely.

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:26.060
Yeah.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:27.980
So you're saying like, could I with either of them?

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:28.980
Oh, a hundred percent.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.980
Yeah.

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:30.980
Joe Biden too.

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:31.980
Sure.

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:32.980
Yeah.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.980
Can you dig into that a little more?

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:38.540
Well, I mean, I don't know what I think there's maybe something implicit in your question,

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:42.300
but this deeper about the nature of politics and politicians.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.300
Yes.

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:48.780
I think with either of them, I mean, the political differences wouldn't be an impediment to having

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.260
a good conversation with either of them.

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:57.620
I think one of the things that's really tough in my experience when talking to elected officials

01:16:57.620 --> 01:17:05.100
is they could be super interesting about a hundred different topics, but handlers decide

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:09.400
or try to get you to talk about something you don't really care about and something

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.180
really narrow, which doesn't bring out your best nor their best.

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:14.940
And that's a frustration.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:18.700
But I think that given an unstructured three hour conversation, I think it would be interesting

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.700
to talk to both.

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:28.100
With Biden, aside from his view on cannabis or whatever, his background and the incredible,

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:33.460
unimaginable family tragedy that he had in his first wife and multiple kids dying.

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:39.500
I mean, it's just incredible, you know, and with Trump, I think also you could have an

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.500
interesting conversation.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.500
Yeah.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:46.100
Those, the human beings with a life story there that, uh, and they're some of the most

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:53.500
successful humans who have ever lived to have, uh, rose to this highest office in interesting

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.500
complex ways.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.500
Yes.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:18:00.400
I mean, one of the things I'm troubled by, maybe you can speak to is why we're so negative

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.100
towards presidential candidates and presidents.

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.620
Why it's just, they go through this shit storm.

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:15.340
No matter who they are, they're like hated, like all the conspiracy theories and just,

01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:18.900
the dynamics of how we talk about them is vicious.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:25.340
If you, if you just look at reply, Steven Barack Obama on Twitter, it's like, what is

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.340
going on here?

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.340
Why?

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.340
Why?

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:31.740
Because we look at other leaders in other spaces and we're generally positive about

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.740
it.

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:33.740
Yeah.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:35.700
There's a couple of different things.

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:40.860
There's this dynamic, which is really unfortunate, which is you ask people, do you approve of

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:43.740
the job a particular president is doing?

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:47.460
And very often, if at any point while they were in office, they did something you don't

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.460
like, people will say, I don't approve.

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.980
And so by its nature, what that means is just like the longer you're in office, the lower

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.100
your approval rating is going to be.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:56.900
And very often that's the way it works.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:19:02.540
I mean, there's major events like nine 11 spike George W. Bush's approval to a incredible

01:19:02.540 --> 01:19:03.540
level.

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:04.780
Then it came back down with the Iraq war.

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:08.120
But there's this unfortunate thing that when, when people are just asked, you think Biden's

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.540
doing a good job?

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:14.180
If four months ago, Biden did something on healthcare that somebody didn't like, even

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:18.860
if you like most of it, a lot of people from that point forward will say, I don't approve.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.220
They might still vote for him because they like him better than the alternative or whatever.

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.660
It's just the dynamic of politics and I agree.

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.820
It's very, does it have to be that way?

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:33.460
I don't think it has to be that way, but to unwind it, so many things would have to change.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:39.020
I think our election system is part of why politics is the way it is, where you have

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:44.540
two choices and it's first past the post and we have this electoral college so that depending

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:49.100
on which state you vote in, the kind of meaning and significance of your vote is different.

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:53.600
If you vote in Montana, it's the Republican candidate's going to win and that changes

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.600
the dynamics.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.660
I think that's part of it.

01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:03.220
I think that at a personal level, I've experienced this in my life a lot.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:07.340
We've become, and by we, I mean people in the United States to some degree who talk

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:08.340
about this stuff.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:14.100
Become uncomfortable when there is disagreement and it bleeds over into now we can't have

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.620
a normal interpersonal relationship anymore.

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.960
I'm from Argentina and in Argentina it's really common.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:26.220
Even in my family, there are incredibly heated political debates at the start, the middle,

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.660
the end of some kind of gathering, but then everybody just goes back to like, okay, we

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:36.380
disagree on some things, but that's okay and we can now go and you know, finish cooking

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.940
the beef or whatever it is that we're doing.

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:43.300
And I experienced this even with people who come up to me on the street and they go, just

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:49.060
earlier today, a guy came up to me and he said, RFK all the way, baby, talking about

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:53.620
Bobby Kennedy Jr. and I just kind of, you know, I said, oh, all right, you know, let's

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:55.200
see what happens.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:59.180
And then there was another moment where the guy ended up standing next to me for maybe

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.480
longer than he thought and I could tell this guy's getting so awkward because it was an

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.420
utterance he thought that would just be on the fly and he'd be gone.

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:08.620
But now we're standing next to each other waiting for our sandwiches.

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:09.620
It's like no big deal.

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.540
You know, it's just, oh, okay, you like Bobby Kennedy Jr.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.540
I don't plan to vote for it.

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:14.540
It's fine.

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:16.460
You know, and that's like a sociocultural thing.

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:21.700
I think there's lots of other countries I've spent time in Italy, I have relatives in Israel

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:25.540
where like shouting at each other is sort of like normal and then you just go back and

01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:26.540
finish the meat.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:31.220
It sounds like shouting, I'm sort of exaggerating, but very animated, what seemed like big disagreements

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.980
and then everybody's cool.

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.660
I wish it were more normal.

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:40.620
So maybe the mechanism of going from shouting to being cool again needs to improve because

01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.940
maybe we can't solve the shouting at each other.

01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:43.940
Maybe not.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:48.420
So maybe we need to somehow figure out the de-escalation, like making up.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:51.220
I've had a few recent fights with friends like that.

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.220
Really?

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:53.220
For politics?

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.220
No.

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:55.220
Oh.

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:56.220
No.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:04.160
But political style, emotionally drenched stuff and it was interesting to go through

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:09.000
that full process and then make up at the end, but it was a process and it was a process

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.880
that required being in person and talking through it and it was stressful, the whole

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.400
thing and then maybe because most of our interactions are online, we don't get a chance to do that

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.240
in person, making up again.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:27.400
I don't know, but do you think it's a feature or a bug of the system that we're so, we just

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.640
hate the powerful?

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.240
You mentioned the online part.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:38.640
I think it's a, you mentioned it earlier perfectly, which is you take contentious political issues.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:45.700
You create a platform that rewards controversy and disagreement and limits the number of

01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:48.440
characters you can use to express yourself.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:53.280
You kind of throw it into a baking dish and you know, mix the entire thing up.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.740
It's complete and total chaos and one of the things that, you know, I've talked before

01:22:56.740 --> 01:23:00.080
about all the angry emails and threats and stuff that I get.

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:05.360
I'm acutely aware that if I had in-person conversations with most of these people, the

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:09.640
conversations would basically be like, oh, we have different views about how to solve

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.280
some of the problems we're facing.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:17.200
We probably agree about what the problem is and we probably share many values, but on

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:23.240
these particular four issues, we may have very different views, but that's okay.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:29.640
Online that's not the case and it leads to, you know, the, the mess mess that we get ourselves

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.640
in.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:33.520
But I think that it's a feature of a lot of the systems that are being used to disseminate

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:34.520
information.

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.280
Again, let me linger on that.

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:43.640
Do you regret some of the mockery and the snark you use on Twitter and even in your

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.000
show that kind of feeds that division?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:55.620
I don't regret it in the sense that it's a calculated part or tool that I use in addition

01:23:55.620 --> 01:24:00.980
to figuring out how to simplify complicated concepts and choosing stories that I think

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:01.980
are underrepresented.

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:05.380
And you know, it's, it's all part of like the package of what I'm doing.

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:13.380
I recognize that my show is not the audio visual visual version of a peer reviewed,

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:17.940
uh, you know, randomized controlled trial about abortion views on abortion or whatever

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:18.940
the case.

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:25.180
Like I'm very much aware of that, but I don't regret including it as a, as a tool that I've

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:30.180
used to build the community in some total that I've built over the last more than 10

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.180
years.

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:35.020
I guess I could ask about the different trajectories you think your show might take.

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:40.580
So you know, the dynamic you had with Donald Trump Jr. and maybe Candace Owens is the more

01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:42.500
appropriate comparison.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:48.220
Are you okay having that dance for the next few years between you and Candace Owens and

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:54.920
just kind of the mockery, the derision that's a part of that process and, and taking part

01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:05.580
in that, you know, I'm fine with it in the sense of personally, I tolerate it well until

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:10.320
it crosses the line and people pull my family in and people, right.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.500
So that's the part that we set the family stuff aside.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.200
If I set that aside, just in the digital space, I'm glad to mix it up.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:20.260
Now the truth is Candace Owens has had me blocked for years up until this incident.

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:25.060
I don't know why she unblocked me just to tweet about what I tweeted about.

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:26.900
I don't know the backstory of that genuinely.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:28.460
I have no idea.

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:32.440
So I don't have a sense that she's super interested in engaging with me on that.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.660
But all of these people, I mean, Candace Owens is welcome on my show anytime.

01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:37.960
Don Jr.'s welcome on my show anytime.

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.300
It's been a decade since I had Ben Shapiro on.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.080
He's welcome at any time.

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:46.700
I'm glad to have these conversations and I think it's an important thing.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:51.560
And also, I wish that everybody was willing to have the conversations in good faith rather

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:56.020
than as performance, it's not even really performance art, rather than being simply

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.340
performative for an audience that you have.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:02.380
In terms of your motivations, do you see, do you worry about the effects of something

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:08.220
you spoke off, spoke about offline with like the YouTube algorithm?

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:15.020
Do you, are you driven by the number of views your videos get or are you driven by something

01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.020
else?

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:24.460
So in my world, I guess I would say the number of views that any platform generates is a

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:27.620
metric that I can choose how to interpret.

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:34.020
I can choose to interpret it as I've created content that's interesting to people or I've

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.540
created content that's really angering people and that's why they're showing up.

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:38.540
They don't actually like it.

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:41.020
It's because they're angry or whatever else the case may be.

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:45.100
But it is true that there are algorithmic changes that can take place.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:49.100
Something happened in early January that affected us on YouTube or there are periods

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:53.300
on TikTok where you can tell we're doing all the same things.

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:56.740
Something has happened and then you never usually figure out what it is.

01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:02.180
So for me, it's sort of just like a general tool to see what is the level of interest

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:06.860
in what I'm doing and are the numbers so out of whack with what I would expect that I should

01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:09.100
look into whether something deeper is happening.

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:12.180
Has there been some change to an algorithm or whatever the case may be?

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:18.620
I had a debate once with someone who accused me of using click bait to generate views and

01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:23.460
we had a really interesting conversation where I said, tell me really what you mean by that.

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:30.020
Is your argument that I'm using titles that don't actually represent what's in the video?

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:32.020
No, what's in the title is in the video.

01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:34.780
I go, OK, so it's not that the title is dishonest.

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:40.660
Are you same saying I'm deliberately picking titles that will garner a larger audience?

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:42.260
And they said, yeah, that's kind of what I mean.

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:44.420
And I said, isn't that kind of what we're all doing?

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:48.580
The alternative would be choosing titles to generate a smaller audience, which seems like

01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:50.420
a real kind of waste of time.

01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:57.620
So I'm trying to navigate and play the game in a way that's comfortable, but use the metrics

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:00.700
more as a tool than as something to obsess over.

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:09.180
Nevertheless, the metrics are what they are in that they are able to affect your psyche.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:13.460
It's very difficult, which is why I have a Chrome extension that hides all the views

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:17.900
and all that on YouTube for me.

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:22.980
It's difficult not to let it affect how you think about ideas.

01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:29.980
So maybe your extensive exploration of a particular topic like healthcare generated very few views.

01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:33.580
It's difficult for you to still care about healthcare.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:38.980
There's some aspect of the human mind that starts being affected by those views.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.020
And I think that's a really dangerous thing.

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:48.540
Mostly it's probably beneficial because it probably makes you a better presenter.

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:54.780
If you do care about a topic a lot, you become more charismatic, you learn sort of in a Jimmy

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:58.020
Mr. Beast way how to present the ideas better.

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:02.980
But it also can affect which topics you choose to cover, what you choose to think about those

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:08.100
topics, the audience capture those topics, and that's a really scary effect.

01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.420
I'm really worried about my own mind in that.

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.780
So I run from that aggressively.

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:20.180
One of the things that I include in my overall approaches, I don't think about any one clip.

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:25.020
I think about an entire show or a week of shows or a month of shows.

01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.620
And so it's less about does any one clip do well?

01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:33.660
My view going in is I'm going to do stuff that won't do that well, but I think it's

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.580
really important to do and I want to make it part of my show.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:41.680
And so when I did a clip with 10 ideas for reducing gun violence, I know that that's

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:43.780
not going to get 500,000 or a million views.

01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:45.700
I know it's just not going to.

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:50.460
And the first day it'll get 12,000 and I'll go, I don't care.

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:51.460
That's fine.

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:54.660
There's a group of people in my audience that values this stuff and I want to keep doing

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.660
this stuff.

01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.740
I'll end up surprised sometime.

01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:03.220
And two weeks later has 150,000 views because it started being shared or great.

01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:08.620
But I don't go into it thinking these all need to be home runs by that metric.

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:13.100
I always go in saying I want to put out a diversity of content, including stuff that

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:16.540
is less titillating and salacious, but is important to do.

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:19.080
It's more researched, et cetera.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:22.100
And so that's the way I try to resist exactly what you're talking about.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:23.940
And I think you have to probably know yourself.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:27.100
Like for me, metrics, I just like numbers too much.

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.780
And for me, metrics do affect me.

01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:30.460
This is why I don't pay attention at all.

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.100
Like I can't.

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:36.820
I would love to hire somebody in the team who cares because we currently have folks

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:43.180
who all of us just don't care because he probably is good to care enough to kind of just do

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:46.020
good thumbnails and this kind of stuff to pay attention.

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:51.300
But to me personally, I just find inner peace and focus if I don't think about the numbers

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:52.300
at all.

01:30:52.300 --> 01:31:00.500
Because I find myself, I just remember a long time ago when I started a podcast, I would

01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:05.460
think that I failed if it didn't do well, like if I didn't celebrate the person well

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:09.940
enough, I didn't do a good job enough of a conversation when that's not necessarily

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:12.740
at all what that means.

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:13.740
It's hard not to.

01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:14.740
This is tough stuff.

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:17.020
I mean, yeah, I know exactly what you're saying.

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:22.860
And part of it is, I mean, it's, it starts in my, you have a little bit of a different

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:27.380
situation than me because you're doing long form conversations with people and the prep

01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.860
is a little bit different.

01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:32.340
One of the things in my space, because I'm reacting mostly to what's going on in the

01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:36.500
news and then also picking topics to dive into a little bit more deeply, is I have very

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:42.200
little control over the news cycle and there is a meta metric or a macro metric that affects

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:49.020
me that will quadruple my audience and then take 75% of it away, which is the seasonality

01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.420
of election cycles.

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:56.580
And the first few election cycles, it's very tough because I go, it's, it's October.

01:31:56.580 --> 01:32:00.660
I'm like, at this rate, we're going to have 20 million subscribers by next.

01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:02.620
These numbers are unbelievable.

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:07.060
And then it's January 30th, the inauguration's over.

01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:10.580
The debate is about the debt ceiling and nothing's going on.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:13.020
And I go, nobody's watching my content.

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:17.380
I must've, I must've forgotten to upload a, like something must be wrong.

01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:19.540
It's completely beyond my control.

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:23.900
So I just, and I think part of what you're saying is I try to focus on the things I can

01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:28.620
control and understand those that I really have no control over whatsoever and try not

01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:31.460
to worry about them.

01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:35.740
And try to do the things that make you happy at the end of the day.

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:40.780
You mentioned RFK, the guy you met, what do you think about some of the other candidates

01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:45.900
outside of Joe Biden in the Democratic party, RFK Jr.

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.660
What do you think of him as a candidate?

01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:48.660
I've met him.

01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:51.960
We once had dinner and we have a number of friends in common, which is what makes this

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:54.600
a little more awkward.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:02.880
But I think his campaign is basically sort of like a chaos candidacy to raise awareness

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:06.960
and maybe raise money either for his book or his anti-vaccine organization, Children's

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.360
Defense Fund, I believe it's called.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:13.880
I think there's some reporting that Steve Bannon really liked the idea of him running

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:17.520
as a Democrat again to just generate chaos.

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:19.200
I don't find it super interesting.

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:23.560
I don't find it worthy of that much discussion.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:30.680
Smart guy, nice guy has been doing anti-vaccine work that I don't find particularly inspiring.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.600
So it's not just anti-COVID vaccine.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.800
It's more broader than he's been in that space long before the COVID vaccines.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.800
Yeah.

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.800
Yeah.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:39.800
I don't find it super interesting.

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:44.680
Well, he also wrote the book, uh, the real Anthony Fauci, is that the name of the book?

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.680
Did he write that?

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:46.680
That's interesting.

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:47.680
I didn't, I don't know.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:48.680
That's, I'm not sure about that.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.760
I'm aware of that book.

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.760
I didn't know he wrote it.

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:55.760
I think I knew, but it's been, uh, uh, it's been on my reading list to get, uh, I've been

01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:02.040
trying to get a good balanced reading list about, uh, the COVID pandemic to understand

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.000
what the hell happened.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.720
And, um, anytime I start to try to go into that place, it's just, I'm exhausted by it.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:14.800
Well, it's interesting to me that you wouldn't wait longer before delving into those books

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:18.360
to have maybe a more clear hindsight.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.560
I think this is a pretty good time.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.560
You don't think so.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.200
Like this is, uh, it depends on your goals.

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:31.160
If you're thinking of it as a historical event, yes, you should probably wait longer.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:38.400
But if you're thinking about like understanding what is broken about our system that we responded

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:43.800
so poorly, that there was so much division, what is broken about our political system

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:48.080
that, um, it didn't unite us, it divided us.

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.280
Who's to blame?

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.200
There's probably a lot of different narratives, but I feel like the more you learn about this,

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.880
the better you can understand.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.040
I read, um, I'm just Vladimir Putin.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:03.000
I read like five biographies already, maybe more, um, just, it helps to really understand

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.320
the people involved, the organizations evolved, I don't know, everything from the scientists

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.320
to the political leaders.

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.200
Um, it felt like the blog posts and the tweets didn't quite capture.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.800
They didn't quite get, no, one of the things I read a ton, I don't read any like modern

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.800
political books.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:24.160
So I don't read the memoirs of elected officials.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.560
I don't read any, I just feel like I get enough of it in my job.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:30.320
So my reading list is just other things.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:34.760
It's history, it's narrative, nonfiction, economics, et cetera.

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.440
And that's my bias because I'm so overloaded with a lot of the stuff you're talking about.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:40.560
I haven't read any of Obama's books.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.640
I didn't read John Bolton's book or, you know, I don't read any of that stuff, although

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.680
I'm sure there, there is value to be gleaned from it.

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:54.840
What about the other candidate that, uh, according to the subreddit, and as you mentioned, you've

01:35:54.840 --> 01:36:01.520
criticized a little bit, uh, Marianne Williamson, do you think, uh, what are the pros and cons

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.680
of her as a candidate?

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:08.360
This is another area where many in my audience really are angry with me.

01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.940
I don't find her candidacy super interesting.

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.720
I'll tell you the pros and the cons as I see them.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:19.000
I do think that we have elected officials in the U S particularly presidents from a

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.040
really narrow range of backgrounds.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:26.800
So it's lawyers and sometimes business people, very, very often lawyers.

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:30.760
I would, I think we would benefit from a much greater diversity of backgrounds.

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.960
And I once said, and that would include, uh, people from education, people from the science

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.720
world, people with backgrounds, maybe running nonprofits, et cetera.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.280
Now, Marianne Williamson did, I guess at one point run some kind of small nonprofit and

01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:46.960
some in my audience thought that credential alone would make me fall head over heels in

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.120
love with the idea of a Marianne candidacy.

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.020
I've interviewed for her.

01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:53.700
It's just not for me is the way I like to say it.

01:36:53.700 --> 01:37:00.520
It's the, the background of the woo woo type stuff is a bit off putting to me.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:07.120
I understand that someone with literal Christian Bible beliefs that also I don't like, maybe

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.640
I'm more willing to accept as most of our presidents, of course, have had those views

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.680
because they're otherwise more qualified.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:20.160
But some of the things that she says just strike me as, I just, I just don't know.

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:21.920
I'll give you an example.

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:27.520
When she was on with Russell Brand, she said, there's no such thing as clinical depression.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:31.980
It just means someone in a clinic told you, you have depression.

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:33.360
I don't believe that to be the case.

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.040
I think we have an understanding there's two types of depression.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:38.380
There's like a genetic predisposition depression.

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:43.000
There's like a acute something's happening in my life, temporary depression.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.900
When she was asked about it recently, she said, I didn't mean it.

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:51.200
I was just trying to impress Russell Brand.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:55.360
I don't know if I'm more bothered by the things she first said or by the fact that she wanted

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:59.480
to impress Russell Brand, but it's just like, it's just really not for me.

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:03.960
And I agree with her on, we need to take the climate more seriously.

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.840
We need to expand access to hell.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:07.200
I'm with all of that stuff.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.920
Now I want to say one other thing about this.

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:12.360
Anybody who wants to run should run.

01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:17.800
I am not suggesting there should be an uncontested primary for Joe Biden.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:18.800
Absolute.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.160
So you think it should be contested?

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.840
Well, what I mean by contested is, so there's two parts to what we mean by contested.

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.760
Will the DNC organize debates and we'll get to that in a second.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:31.840
But should should anybody who's on the left get out of the way because Joe Biden is president

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.480
and he's running for reelection?

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:34.480
Absolutely not.

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.400
The question about should there be debates?

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.560
I would like there to be debates.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.000
The DNC pretty clearly isn't going to organize them.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.720
I think if you did them, you would have to say at what polling level do you qualify?

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.980
And I don't know exactly where you put that number, but I think it would be a great thing

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:56.500
to put Joe Biden on a stage with if you can get what, six percent, eight percent.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.180
I'm not really sure what the number would be.

01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:00.180
I'm totally all for that.

01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:05.660
Why is this set of candidates, at least from my perspective, so weak?

01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:07.100
Do you have do you have an understanding?

01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:10.460
There's a lot of different answers to this.

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:14.660
One aspect to this, which I think is more of a sociocultural thing, which I've recently

01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:20.780
read about to some degree, is the job actually turns off the people who would be best at

01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:23.860
it because of what you need to do to become president.

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:31.420
And it includes all but completely abandoning your existing day to day life job, which you

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:35.360
may depend on and family to some degree.

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:39.800
It's horribly negative, as we already talked about.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:43.740
And at the end of all of that, you either lose and then have to rebuild.

01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:47.380
And maybe you're not in a position to be able to do that or you win.

01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:52.380
And then now you've got four years of being one of the most hated people, no matter how

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:53.700
good a job you do.

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:58.340
So I think by its nature, it turns off a lot of people that would otherwise be good.

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:03.180
I also think that there's a lot of posturing from within the parties about, well, you might

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:04.620
be good, but it's not your time yet.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:05.620
So you should wait.

01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:08.240
And then let's talk about maybe a Senate seat here and there.

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:09.980
So it's like it's like a company essentially.

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:12.860
And they're figuring out where they want to place people.

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:16.220
I think all of these things make it so we end up with candidates.

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:17.980
People aren't super thrilled with.

01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:24.180
So it's difficult for somebody who's young or an outsider to, uh, to quickly become

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.180
a candidate.

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.460
I think that that's true.

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:31.660
And I think also in a lot of ways, it's just not, I mean, would you want to be president?

01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:32.660
No.

01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:36.860
I mean, I can't because I wasn't born in the U S it's easy for me to say, but, um, if everyone

01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:40.820
says no, then we're get the people that we have.

01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:42.360
No, I understand.

01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.500
So I would love to help somehow.

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:45.620
Sure.

01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:50.340
And I feel like there's not even a mechanism for helping except through the democratic,

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:51.340
through the voting process.

01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:57.220
But I'm just annoyed how little technology there is in the whole process, how little

01:40:57.220 --> 01:41:00.820
innovation there is in the whole process, all of this.

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:07.180
The sad thing is this is written about a lot, which is there's this thing called political

01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:13.560
hobbyism and I think there's a good chance that some of the people in my audience are

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:19.360
political hobbyists in the sense that they follow this stuff as entertainment to some

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.660
degree.

01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:26.280
And I've written a lot about how, uh, I've read a lot and talked a lot about how, okay,

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.960
we vote every two years or every four years in our local elections, et cetera.

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.360
And then we think about politics all the time.

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.980
Uh, Neil Postman wrote about this in his book, amusing ourselves to death, but what are you

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:42.560
actually going to do about the kids starving in this country and the nuclear buildup in

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.560
that country?

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:44.560
Okay.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:48.160
If everybody refocused their attention on their immediate communities and that could

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.320
mean any number, it could mean the town or city you live in, or it might mean, um, an

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.520
athletic club or whatever.

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.320
If everybody, this time they spent on political hobbyism, they moved somewhere else, which

01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.440
might put me out of a job.

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.440
That's okay.

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:03.060
I'm willing to lose my job because I think it would be so beneficial.

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:06.760
Then our communities would just be that much better, uh, because you can actually affect

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:11.180
change in a much more tangible way locally, whether it's obvious people talk about potholes,

01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:12.940
but other things as well.

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:13.940
Yeah.

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:18.980
And I wish our system was more amenable to that kind of contribution, hopefully through

01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:19.980
the digital space.

01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:20.980
It would be.

01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:27.060
Uh, let me ask you about on the Republican side, Ron DeSantis, what do you think of him

01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:30.060
as a candidate running against Donald Trump?

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:36.460
I think in the couple of weeks before our discussion today, his campaign, which hasn't

01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:40.500
even started, has sort of started to implode.

01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:45.340
This was something that I started thinking about in September, October.

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:50.540
He really doesn't seem ready for prime time in the sense that just being confronted and

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:51.940
confronted is not even the right word.

01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:57.960
Just being asked about some topics he didn't really seem to want to talk about.

01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:04.660
He responded in such a sort of disproportionate unhinged way during his recent trip to Asia.

01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:08.820
He was asked about why aren't you or why are you responding?

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:12.020
in this weird way to Trump's attacks on you.

01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:16.660
And he went into this weird bobblehead thing with a weird smile and something came out

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:17.660
that didn't make any sense.

01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:19.540
And he sort of got mad at the reporter.

01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:23.800
And it was just like, if you can't handle that, you can't be on a debate stage with

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:24.800
Donald Trump.

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:28.220
And again, for all my criticisms of Trump, the guy gets you on a debate stage.

01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:30.480
He can make you look pretty silly.

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:37.060
He was recently asked about his role at Guantanamo Bay when he was an officer in, I forget

01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:39.180
which branch of the armed forces.

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:42.860
And he just sort of attacked the journalist asking the question.

01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:45.580
And it just looked very bad.

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:49.060
And there are increasingly big Republican donors who are not fans of Trump and were

01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:52.700
sort of hoping to put their eggs in the Ron DeSantis basket who are saying, this guy just

01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:53.700
doesn't have what it takes.

01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:54.900
I don't think he can do it.

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:57.940
So I don't know if DeSantis will be able to get away.

01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:02.500
Once you're polling 20 something like he is and you haven't even announced, it's very

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:03.500
attractive.

01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:08.820
Probably to some degree is thinking if I wait till 2028, I might not have this opportunity

01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:09.860
again.

01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:15.660
But Trump's polling 52, 53, which means even if DeSantis gets all of the current non-Trump

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:19.500
vote, he has to figure out how to take something more from Trump.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.620
I just don't know how he does it.

01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:24.660
First of all, the implosion aspect, that's, that's part of the process, isn't it?

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:30.980
You kind of implode a bunch of, uh, a bunch of times and then rebuild yourself and rebuild

01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:33.420
them because the new cycle kind of forgets.

01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:34.480
That's possible.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:37.840
The problem is if he, the first debate is in August.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:44.020
So that's only a few months away and the decision is going to have to be made pretty soon.

01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:49.620
And unless he can get a new momentum going, uh, I just don't know how he gets what he

01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:51.780
needs in order to really have a shot.

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.060
So would anyone else run against Donald Trump?

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:55.060
It's very tough right now.

01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:56.420
I mean, there are other people running.

01:44:56.420 --> 01:45:01.780
There's this guy, Vivek Ramaswamy, who's running a Nikki Haley is running her campaign, basically

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:02.940
dead on arrival.

01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:05.620
Um, Trump actually does better in polls.

01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:10.140
The more people run when, when it's just him and DeSantis, that's the best scenario for

01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:11.220
DeSantis.

01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:14.940
It's not great for DeSantis, but it's, it's, uh, certainly better.

01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:20.860
Um, but I think the difficulty is this is a question for Republicans to figure out.

01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:25.580
The people who rightly recognized in 2016 that this guy is not good for their party,

01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:30.780
um, still believe this guy is not good for their party, but many of them recognize that

01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:34.380
most of the voters are still behind him.

01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:36.740
You can always say it's early.

01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:38.340
His polling doesn't really mean anything.

01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:39.340
Anything could happen.

01:45:39.340 --> 01:45:42.420
Something major would have to happen for Trump to lose that lead.

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:46.500
If he got more, uh, if he was arrested two more times and had more indictments and it

01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:51.460
just became like this guy can't even campaign because he's so busy going from court to court.

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:52.740
Maybe that would make a difference.

01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:55.540
It's really tough to imagine.

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:59.900
You said that there are three categories of people who vote Republican and, uh, that Trump

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:01.260
introduced the fourth one.

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:02.260
Wow.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.700
Can you go through the four categories?

01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:05.700
Sure.

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:09.100
So you've got like your pro-business, low tax Republicans.

01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:11.460
These are mostly people like Mitt Romney.

01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.900
Mitt Romney has a bit of the social conservatism as well.

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:17.700
He's Mormon and that's there, but Mitt Romney primarily, particularly as a Northeast sort

01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:18.700
of Republican.

01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:24.020
I mean, I know Utah, but governor of Massachusetts, he is like a low tax pro-business type guy.

01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:29.700
Um, you've got your libertarian type Republicans who are primarily about, uh, freedom and liberty

01:46:30.180 --> 01:46:31.180
often.

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:34.780
They are actually more socially liberal where they go, I don't care about gay marriage liberal.

01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:37.500
You know, I don't care so much about abortion.

01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:42.740
Um, and that overlapped a little bit with the tea party movement in 2010, although tea

01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:46.720
party did have a religious component, but sort of like the libertarian freedom minded

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:50.720
folks and then the religious conservatives, people that support candidates like Josh Hawley

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:56.180
or, uh, Ted Cruz, et cetera, where their big thing are social issues.

01:46:56.180 --> 01:47:00.940
Often they actually want a Christianity being civil government.

01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:02.880
They don't want separation of church and state.

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.460
Those are traditionally the three Republican groups.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:10.020
The one that Trump introduced was people who just didn't really pay attention to politics,

01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:16.220
but either followed celebrity or had grievances that they didn't yet have a scapegoat for.

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:21.420
Um, and were sort of right leaning culturally, even though they didn't attribute that to

01:47:21.700 --> 01:47:27.020
Republicanism and Trump was able to bring them into politics often for the first time

01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:28.140
as voters.

01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:33.700
They could be part of any of those three groups if they get more into politics or kind of

01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:37.940
be their own thing, but they're more kind of like cult of personality.

01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:39.860
I'm here for Trump types.

01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:43.820
Did it have to do anything about the culture wars and the identity politics, all that kind

01:47:43.820 --> 01:47:44.820
of stuff?

01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:45.820
Yeah.

01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:50.060
I mean, so in 2016 when Trump mobilized them, those weren't really issues the way they are

01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:51.060
now.

01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:55.180
So I think at the time, at that time, it certainly was not a factor.

01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:56.460
What was the mobilizing issue?

01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.980
I know it was just anti Hillary in 2016 there.

01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:06.700
He did a good job on anti Hillary, but a lot of it was identifying real economic problems,

01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:11.540
wage depression, lack of jobs in parts of the country, you know, Ohio and Indiana.

01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:13.620
Trump rightly identified like we have an issue here.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:16.020
We don't have enough entrepreneurship, et cetera.

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.580
Um, but there was also a lot of scapegoating that was, you know, China and people coming

01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:25.920
through the U S Mexico border were popular scapegoats for a lot of those problems.

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:29.020
This gets us kind of to populism.

01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:36.560
Populism is a rhetoric and populism as a rhetoric doesn't necessarily come with particular policies.

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:43.020
You can be a populist, a user of populist rhetoric and propose solutions that would

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:46.780
be more aligned with Bernie or Tucker Carlson.

01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:50.420
Populists will often identify the plight of the middle class.

01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:56.660
The difference would be Bernie will say, we've got to put some restrictions on how much billionaires

01:48:56.660 --> 01:49:00.300
can make and we've got to reinvest in these social programs.

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:07.540
Tucker will say BLM taking your house and a Brown person from Mexico taking your job

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.660
are what we need to deal with.

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:14.980
So the, the populist rhetoric can lend itself to very different policy and Trump used that

01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:17.140
very effectively in 2016.

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:22.980
Why do you think Hillary Clinton was hated as intense as she was by a certain percent

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:24.420
of the population?

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:30.780
It feels like, uh, that's the first election I witnessed where there's a lot of hate.

01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.940
Maybe I'm misremembering.

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:36.060
I don't remember Obama.

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.800
I don't remember the degree of hate.

01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.100
There was a conspiracy theory that he wasn't born in this country, but I don't remember

01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:43.980
hate towards Obama.

01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:46.620
Record death threats under Obama more than any previous president.

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:47.980
Towards who?

01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.980
Towards him?

01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:49.980
Towards him.

01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:50.980
Yeah.

01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:54.260
Do you mean more hate between voters or between voters, between voters?

01:49:54.260 --> 01:50:01.080
But like that's, I guess what I was speaking to, but that hate was directed towards, um,

01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:07.380
the narrative, the thread that connected all of that in 2016 was Hillary Clinton.

01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:09.100
Few different things.

01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:12.180
Um, and I'm not ranking these.

01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:14.880
These are just all things that come to mind.

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:21.520
One is Hillary Clinton had been around in the political space for a long time from her

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:26.560
time as first lady through a Senator, secretary of state, et cetera.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:34.040
So I think that there was enough time for different groups to develop an antipathy towards

01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:35.440
her for different reasons.

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:44.320
So time, um, secondly, Trump's branding of her as crooked was very effective where there

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:48.020
were so many people demanding that she be imprisoned.

01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:49.720
If you ask them, what is the crime?

01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:52.840
They don't know, but she should definitely be locked up.

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.480
That became a very big thing.

01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:03.720
The email story as it were, and, uh, James Comey doing a second public event about that

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:06.720
investigation, even though there wasn't any actual news about it, just doing a second

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:12.060
event about it at the last minute, I think hurt her and also generated some hate.

01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.260
I don't find Hillary Clinton to be particularly likable.

01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:18.300
Although I voted for her, I thought she was the better candidate.

01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:23.780
And I think that there are others who also didn't find her particularly likable.

01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:26.140
Those are a lot of impediments to becoming president.

01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:30.660
I was trying to understand why there's so many conspiracy theories about Clintons in

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:33.660
general, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.

01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:37.940
And I, maybe I'm not researched well enough.

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:39.940
Of the why of it.

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:45.420
Actually, the extent of the conspiracy theories, the sort of the, the conspiracy theories that

01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:48.220
they've killed a lot of people, this kind of stuff.

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:51.420
It's hard for me to speak to them because I'm aware that they exist, but I'm not an

01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:57.020
expert in them because they seem so obviously baseless to the degree that I've researched

01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:58.020
them a little bit.

01:51:58.020 --> 01:52:01.420
And then I move on and, uh, you know, it's been years since I've looked at this stuff.

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:06.460
I know there's the Seth Rich one and there's the Clinton body count one.

01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:10.180
I think there's one connected to Epstein, if I recall correctly, there, there's all

01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:14.380
sorts of these different ones, um, without speaking to any of them specifically because

01:52:14.380 --> 01:52:16.980
I'm not the expert on Clinton conspiracies.

01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:22.820
Uh, it does seem as though this stuff for so long has generated an audience.

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:28.060
I mean, I remember in the supermarket when Bill Clinton was president at the checkout,

01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:32.660
seeing the tabloids and there were stuff about Hillary birthed an alien baby and you know,

01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:36.380
all the, it seems like it's been titillating to people for a very long time.

01:52:37.060 --> 01:52:41.420
Well, another question from Reddit, speaking of aliens, uh, I would be curious to hear

01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:47.300
David's views on conspiracies and conspiracy theories, the extent to which real conspiracies

01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:53.980
happen and why conspiracies that have little evidence behind them managed to be so compelling

01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:55.340
to people regardless.

01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.420
Also, please bring up aliens and UAPs.

01:52:58.420 --> 01:52:59.420
Okay.

01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:00.660
Where, where do we start?

01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:01.660
The conspiracy.

01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:02.660
What?

01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:11.220
So what are in general as a person who thinks about politics, uh, thinks about this world,

01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:13.820
like where do conspiracy theories fit in for you?

01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:19.460
I think there have been conspiracies and by conspiracies, I'm using a colloquial definition,

01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:27.020
which is basically, uh, individuals working together to, um, in a clandestine way, uh,

01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:32.620
affect or affect some kind of event or phenomenon, uh, very, very broadly.

01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:39.260
I mean, certainly that those things have happened, um, the, to pick, to jump around to some of

01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:40.460
the things that were in there.

01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:47.500
I think the reason that conspiracy theories are so compelling is that it's really tough

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:50.660
for a lot of people to accept.

01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:56.460
There are random events, not predictable specifically at a stochastic level.

01:53:56.460 --> 01:54:02.900
We might be able to predict them, but specifically unpredictable, bad events in many ways.

01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:06.580
I could be the victim of one or you could, or my family could.

01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:09.740
That's really scary to a lot of people, understandably so.

01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:15.780
And for some people it's less scary and more soothing in a way to say there aren't really

01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:18.180
random events like this.

01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:19.800
Somebody planned it.

01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:23.460
And if we had just known who planned it, it just could have been stopped because we would

01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:25.540
have known exactly when.

01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:30.860
That's just a psychological level, easier to accept for people.

01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:36.900
And I get that to some degree because listen, it's, it's not the most exciting thing that

01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:41.420
everything can just be going fine and something absolutely horrible happens and kills who

01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:44.020
knows some number of people.

01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:48.020
So I think that's the biggest attractor to a lot of these conspiracy theories.

01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:52.580
It doesn't apply to all of them though, but yeah, but there's still kind of a basic understanding

01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:58.860
of human nature where people, some people are greedy and want power and are corrupted

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:00.460
by power.

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:09.740
So there's a kind of these compelling narratives that stick that, I don't know, the vaccine

01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:16.140
is a, is a opportunity for a powerful billionaire to implant chips into you so you can control

01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:17.420
you further.

01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:18.660
Right.

01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:24.140
It doesn't seem, what do I want to say?

01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:31.340
It's like for some reason that doesn't seem as crazy as it should because you think like

01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:37.340
maybe Hollywood contributes to that, but you think, yeah, you could imagine an evil person,

01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:43.300
a person that wants more control, more power, and is also at the same time able to convince

01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:47.540
themselves as history shows that they're actually have the best interest of the populace in

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:51.020
mind, that they're trying to do good for the world.

01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:55.020
So they do evil while trying to do good and you can kind of imagine it.

01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:57.380
So it's like, why not?

01:55:57.380 --> 01:56:06.580
And you listen to people in power, authorities, they kind of look and sound shady, you know,

01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:12.700
like the transparency, especially the older ones, I think younger folks are better at

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:17.940
being like real and transparent and just like revealing their flaws and the basic humanity.

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:21.900
But people that are a little bit older in the positions of power, they're more polished.

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:26.500
They're more like, it feels like they're presenting a narrative where the truth is hidden in the

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:27.500
shadows.

01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:33.780
So I don't think there's anything wrong with suspecting maybe a public figure isn't giving

01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:38.300
me the full story, totally reasonable thing to question.

01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:43.760
I don't think there's anything wrong with exploring a lot of these different things.

01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:48.180
I think the problem becomes, and I know you've talked about this in so many different ways

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:53.580
with other guests, the problem becomes when we lose a shared understanding of how we would

01:56:53.580 --> 01:57:01.180
assess whether any of these things are true and then both alleged evidence and an absence

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:08.000
of evidence both become supportive of the conspiracy theory because if there's bad evidence,

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.520
you manipulate it and say it's good evidence.

01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:13.280
If there's no evidence, you say the evidence was obviously hidden by the people who carried

01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:15.500
out the thing or whatever.

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.400
So unless we can have a shared understanding of how we would determine what's true, these

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:23.800
are common conversations often between atheists and religious folks.

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:29.040
How can we deter like is, is my faith in something or my desire for something to be true, a good

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:30.960
way to evaluate whether it is true.

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.240
They're really similar questions.

01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:38.960
Well, let me ask you about Trump on that front, about the election, 2020 election and maybe

01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:40.880
the better question is about January 6th.

01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:44.000
Do you think January 6th was a big deal?

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.600
I do.

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.120
How big of a deal?

01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:48.120
Compared to what?

01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:49.120
Civil war.

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:53.440
I think it was less of a big deal than the civil war.

01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:54.440
Okay.

01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:57.080
No, I mean, so you, well, it's a very interesting thing though, right?

01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:00.840
Because we have not only the, the event that's, that's clever actually.

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:07.680
It's not only the event, but it's what led up to it and what has happened since and did

01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:17.340
it change what is considered on the table that citizens can, should or might do if they

01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:20.220
disagree with the results of an election.

01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:25.280
So I think that there are further reaching consequences than just was the six hour period

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:29.320
on January 6th, a bigger or smaller deal than the civil war.

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:33.360
And there's so much wrapped up into it.

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:37.320
Many conspiracy theories flowed from January 6th as well.

01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:42.320
Uh, 60 minutes recently featured a guy named Ray apps who was targeted by some on the right,

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:46.480
um, claiming that he was an instigator or an agent of the FBI or something along those

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:47.480
lines.

01:58:47.480 --> 01:58:52.360
Uh, there were people claiming that no real trade was like a no true Scotsman sort of

01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360
thing.

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.260
Like Trump supporters wouldn't riot.

01:58:55.260 --> 01:59:00.860
So by definition, it must have been Antifa, uh, police let them in or police were, you

01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:01.860
know, all these different things.

01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:05.860
I think it was a big deal in a lot of ways because it completely made us have to go back

01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:12.100
to the top to say, okay, what are the parameters of valid discussion and activism in the United

01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:13.100
States?

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:18.820
But what aspect of the January 6th was bad for you?

01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:27.860
Well, I mean, if you're thinking it from a big philosophical political perspective, so

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:35.020
presumably the number of people hurt and the number of people who died is not the only

01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:36.700
metric to consider here.

01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:37.700
Absolutely.

01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:45.460
I think the sum total of what it means about how the United States operates is what's most

01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:48.500
concerning and I'll kind of just like flesh it out a little bit.

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:55.600
So summer of 2020, Trump's already saying they're going to cheat.

01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:00.980
Now the polling is close, but it shows that Biden's in a good position.

02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:02.900
People aren't happy with Trump.

02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:07.500
Any reasonable person would look and say it's going to be close, but Biden certainly wouldn't

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.820
be a crazy thing if Biden won.

02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:12.780
Trump's already saying they're going to cheat with mail-in ballots or they're going to cheat

02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:17.220
with early voting or going to cheat with machines or we should do only in person or whatever

02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:18.760
else the case may be.

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:20.640
We have the election.

02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:24.820
We knew in certain states how the vote count was going to go.

02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:26.820
Some states stop counting at 10 p.m.

02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:28.980
Some states count all of the mail and stuff up front.

02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:30.300
Some don't.

02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:33.100
Everything was completely predictable.

02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.980
At 2 a.m. Trump comes out and says, I won.

02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:38.500
Okay, but where are you getting that, sir?

02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:40.780
As he claims, people always refer to him.

02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:42.420
Where are you getting that?

02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:49.060
And with that statement, immediately we see that there is a large portion of this country

02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:54.920
that either is unable or unwilling to say, wait a second, the polling all said this was

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:57.100
a real possibility.

02:00:57.100 --> 02:01:01.300
The counting schedules are all being adhered to all.

02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:02.300
But Trump won.

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:04.140
That doesn't make any sense.

02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:05.500
That doesn't happen.

02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:06.580
It builds.

02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:11.580
People are donating millions to Trump for supposed audits, which nobody can define,

02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:13.140
lawsuits which go nowhere.

02:01:13.140 --> 02:01:14.900
And it builds and builds and builds.

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.860
And we have a total separation from a factual reality.

02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:22.540
There's no reason to think by December 1st, right, give three weeks to look through some

02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.540
of this stuff.

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:28.220
By December 1st, there's no reasonable case to be made that Trump actually won.

02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:29.500
But it doesn't end there.

02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:35.780
It goes into maybe we can just like send different electors, even though Biden won Arizona.

02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:36.780
Let's just like send.

02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:38.820
I don't remember how many electors it is in Arizona.

02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:42.020
Let's just like send Republican electors to say we vote for Trump.

02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:43.420
But that's that's not democracy.

02:01:43.420 --> 02:01:45.420
That's not the way the system works.

02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:47.740
Let's make sure we're ready.

02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:48.740
Ready for what?

02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:49.740
Exactly.

02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:55.260
And then it builds to maybe Mike Pence can just like prevent Biden from being president

02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:58.320
or maybe we can just interfere in this other way.

02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:02.540
And then it gets to let's break into the Capitol.

02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:10.940
It's the height of saying we no longer comport ourselves attached to what is a verifiable

02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:13.020
factual reality.

02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:20.020
And when we no longer do that, we're also willing to commit crimes, property crimes,

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:25.860
violent crimes to different degrees in order to try to have something other than democracy.

02:02:25.860 --> 02:02:29.900
It wouldn't be democracy if any of those things had happened.

02:02:29.900 --> 02:02:30.900
Yeah.

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.500
I think it's not the height of it.

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:42.220
I think there is still a case to be made that that did not leave the realm of protest versus

02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:45.040
a violation of the principles of democracy.

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:51.980
So to me, the height of what could happen on January 6th is if Donald Trump was much

02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:55.780
better executive, he could take control of the military.

02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:56.780
If it had succeeded.

02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:59.200
No, not even succeeded.

02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:03.840
The attempt would have been more empowered.

02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:04.840
I understand.

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:09.840
So like the way not to bring up Hitler every other word, which is something your subredditor

02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.720
also told me not to do, is kind of an important figure.

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.760
It's interesting to study that moment in history because it reveals so much about human nature

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:20.200
and that all of us are capable of good and evil.

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:25.240
But thank you dear subredditor or redditor for your contribution to the conversation.

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:29.880
I will keep bringing up Hitler and the Third Reich and I'll keep bringing up Stalin.

02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:31.760
There's so much to learn from that.

02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:42.160
Anyway, an effective practice authoritarian could roll the tanks out into the city streets

02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:51.840
to establish order and in so doing pause the process of democracy as opposed to a few protesters

02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:57.000
breaking in to a questionably protected building.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:58.680
I agree that what you're saying would be worse.

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.000
I don't want to use it to minimize what the protesters were intent on doing.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
They failed.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.200
Fortunately, to you, the intention was there.

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:10.320
Well, the intention was Trump should remain president.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:11.320
That's the intention.

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:16.720
And to what length they would have been willing to go if by the evening, early evening, they,

02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:18.560
you know, were sort of like forced out.

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:19.560
I don't know.

02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:23.680
I agree with you that Trump trying to use the military would absolutely be worse.

02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:26.920
You know, there's these reports that he tried to seize voting machines, which is kind of

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:30.840
funny because it's like once you get the machine at Mar-a-Lago, what do you do with it exactly?

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:31.840
I don't know.

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:35.080
There's a like a comedic element to Trump sitting around with voting machines.

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.100
But he did float trying to do some other things.

02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:43.920
I don't believe there's reporting that he actually tried to use the military.

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:49.440
I wonder to what degree this opened the door to further things like this with other, uh,

02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:54.280
other candidates on, you know, even in the Democratic Party also.

02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:59.000
Do you think there'll be more and more questioning of the election results?

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.200
There has been already.

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:02.120
It's very clearly the playbook.

02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.640
Kerry Lake lost.

02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:05.200
She ran for governor in Arizona.

02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:06.200
Twenty twenty two.

02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:07.200
She lost.

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:09.240
What I mean by that is her opponent received more votes.

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:12.320
It's like very clear what it means that she lost.

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:16.120
She insists to this day that she won to this day.

02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:19.880
She did the same grift Trump did about donate.

02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:20.880
We've got a case.

02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:21.880
We won in the case.

02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:22.880
You didn't win.

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:27.120
They just set a court date like that's not, that's not what, you know, lies upon grift

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:28.120
upon lies.

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:29.720
So they, they did it then.

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:36.040
Um, it is, I, I, it's extraordinarily saddening, but it seems like this is now going to be

02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:37.040
part of the playbook.

02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:39.360
Do you think people on the left will start doing it?

02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:44.340
I don't have a reason to believe that that is going to happen, but I'm not going to say

02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:45.340
it never could.

02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:46.340
Absolutely.

02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:47.340
It certainly could.

02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:49.400
People on the left could start using it as a tactic right now.

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.400
There's not a sign that that's going to happen, but it's certainly good.

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:56.620
My expectation is, and I'm not a betting man, but I would bet money.

02:05:56.620 --> 02:06:01.720
If Joe Biden loses in November of twenty twenty four, he will say I lost.

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:03.740
He will call the winner.

02:06:03.740 --> 02:06:07.680
He will concede and he will leave the White House in an orderly fashion.

02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:10.880
You don't think there'll be claims of a hacked election.

02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:17.920
The ability to hack elections is becoming, uh, more and more effective with the developments

02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:19.840
on the artificial intelligence side.

02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:26.160
The difficulty is you're basically saying, will something happen without me knowing anything

02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:27.800
about the election?

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:30.240
Imagine there really was evidence of a hacked election.

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:32.640
Then I would want those claims to be made.

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:36.840
But the way elections have gone in the past, I don't expect that that's a claim that would

02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:37.840
be made.

02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:38.840
No.

02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:44.240
Speaking of evidence of things, uh, that were claimed, what do you think about the Hunter

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:51.400
Biden laptop or as you tweeted, the laptop from hell, the laptop from hell T.M.

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:52.400
Right.

02:06:52.400 --> 02:07:00.280
Uh, to what degree was this laptop story important and to what degree was it not at this point?

02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:09.160
I have said many times, if there is any reason to believe that Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Naomi

02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:16.080
Biden, Jill Biden, Hillary Obama, Doug, and if there's any evidence, any of them committed

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:19.320
a crime, they should be investigated.

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:24.240
They should be charged and they should be tried period.

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:31.280
The Hunter Biden laptop thing has been floating around for so long and we still have zero

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:40.000
actual pieces of evidence of any crime, particularly involving Joe Biden.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.760
There's the claim from some that references to the big guy are about Joe Biden getting

02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.560
10% for some illicit.

02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:48.560
It's been years.

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:49.560
They've been saying this.

02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:52.760
They've not been able to bring forward any evidence on it.

02:07:52.760 --> 02:08:02.120
So my, um, assessment of the Hunter Biden laptop is it seems to mostly be a story about

02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:08.680
nude images released without someone's consent, which is illegal in most states and violates

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.800
Twitter's own policies.

02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:12.720
That's the main story to me.

02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:17.320
Beyond that, I don't know how many people have a copy of this hard drive at this point.

02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:18.320
Rudy had it.

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:19.320
Tucker.

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:22.320
Do you remember when Tucker, this, this is, this is unbelievable.

02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:29.680
Tucker said that he mailed himself a copy, a USB stick, and it got lost in the mail.

02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:35.080
You, you have the mother load proving the criminality of Joe and Hunter Biden.

02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:38.360
And I don't, you just dropped it off with a stamp and it got lost in the mail.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:39.360
You don't have a backup copy.

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:40.360
You don't.

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:43.040
So I'm ready for the evidence to come forward.

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:45.720
Hunter Biden has nothing to do with Joe Biden's administration.

02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:50.500
But as a person who, if he committed a crime, charge them, investigate him, whatever.

02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:53.060
But it's, it's getting, it's almost getting satirical.

02:08:53.060 --> 02:08:55.980
The degree to which they're talking about the Hunter Biden laptop.

02:08:55.980 --> 02:09:02.580
What do you think about the, the social media aspect of this, that that story got censored?

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:06.980
And what do you think about censorship in general on social media, that that story during

02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:11.340
an important time in the electoral process got censored?

02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:17.720
So I, uh, as a matter of principle, I think we have to define what we mean by censorship,

02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:22.640
but I'm against censorship short of illegal content, I guess is the way I would put it.

02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:27.840
I do respect a company's right to have terms of service and to enforce them as long as

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.060
they're not illegal.

02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:32.160
If Twitter were to say, we don't publish content from Jewish people.

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:35.120
Okay, now we've got a problem on our hands.

02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:43.120
But um, what, what is dubious to me is the claim that had people been able to see Hunter

02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:46.620
Biden's genitals, they would have voted for Trump.

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:51.940
Which I know it's like, David, you're, you're making light of and, but at the end of the

02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:57.380
day, what exactly is the claim that if you had known more about Hunter Biden, I guess

02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:02.320
allegedly hiring prostitutes and having a drug problem and seeing pictures, you wouldn't

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:04.020
have voted for Joe Biden.

02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:07.900
I mean, I know me as a voter, I don't feel that way.

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:15.060
I think, uh, it's less about the content of the story and about the actions of a social

02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:19.680
media company to control what you see and what you don't see.

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:23.420
So you could imagine a social media company like Facebook and Twitter making the same

02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:29.080
kind of decision about a more impactful story than a few dick pics on a laptop.

02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:33.420
Well, I think if that happened, then my view might be different, right?

02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:38.600
But I do my, my general view though on the Hunter Biden story is had the articles not

02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:44.380
contained those images that were illegal in many states and violated Twitter's policies,

02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:46.140
I would say publish it.

02:10:46.140 --> 02:10:47.140
Absolutely.

02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:50.540
I don't think it would have had an impact, but I would be in favor of it being, of the

02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:52.820
links being allowed a hundred percent.

02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:53.820
Okay.

02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:54.820
Uh, you mentioned Tucker.

02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:57.660
What do you, what do you think about Tucker getting fired from Fox?

02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:05.220
Um, you're a media person that works independently, Tucker was a media person who doesn't work

02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:06.220
independently.

02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:07.220
Right.

02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:08.220
Uh, yeah.

02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:11.980
What do you, what do you think about that particular situation?

02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:16.260
Is it representative of some big shift that's happening in mainstream media?

02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:18.780
What would the shift be?

02:11:18.780 --> 02:11:23.660
Uh, basically mainstream media freaking out because the funding is getting less and less

02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:24.660
and less and less.

02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:30.260
And there's going to give more power to individual commentators, basically Tucker Carlson just

02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:32.060
starting a podcast.

02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:34.500
So I think that's what he should do.

02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:39.140
I think that's the most profitable path rather than maybe going to work for Newsmax or whatever

02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:40.140
the case may be.

02:11:40.740 --> 02:11:46.020
The firing fundamentally was not a politically oriented firing that suggests Fox News is

02:11:46.020 --> 02:11:48.180
changing its tune politically in any way.

02:11:48.180 --> 02:11:49.900
There's no evidence of that whatsoever.

02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:54.020
Um, Tucker Carlson basically became a legal problem for Fox News.

02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:55.980
There's really four points to it.

02:11:55.980 --> 02:12:02.360
One is the $787 and a half million dollar settlement with Dominion partially was because

02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:06.940
of the, um, claims that went out on Tucker Carlson's program.

02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:14.540
So to some degree, Tucker's program was a prominent, uh, node of the problematic claims

02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:16.140
that became the subject of the lawsuit.

02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:17.140
That's number one.

02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:22.140
Number two, smartmatic, which is another voting machine company, still has a similarly sized

02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:25.620
lawsuit against Fox News based on the exact same sorts of claims.

02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:27.200
It may cost Fox News again.

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:30.540
So this is now two problems that Tucker's a big contributor to.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:36.620
Number three, former Tucker Staffer has brought a lawsuit and I don't remember the exact

02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:41.060
claims, but I know that there are claims of different types of discrimination.

02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:46.140
It seems like it has legs and that may be a third payout related to Tucker Carlson.

02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:50.380
And based on the 60 minutes piece from a few weeks ago, Ray Epps saying Tucker ruined his

02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:54.460
life by fomenting conspiracies about him around January 6th.

02:12:54.460 --> 02:12:56.420
That's ripe for another lawsuit.

02:12:56.420 --> 02:13:04.340
So to me, Tucker's firing was a risk mitigation strategy, uh, of many that will be employed

02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:06.140
as, as these lawsuits come forward.

02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:10.040
There's no evidence that it's because Fox didn't like.

02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:11.700
And what we mean by that, who are we talking about?

02:13:11.700 --> 02:13:15.780
Rupert Murdoch doesn't like or the, I don't know, but I don't have any reason to believe

02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:19.340
it's because Tucker's ideas were no longer welcome on Fox.

02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:20.340
Certainly the audience like them.

02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:21.340
So interesting.

02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:27.260
It's not about, it's not even about the ratings, it's about just the legal costs.

02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:28.260
Fox is interesting.

02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:33.080
The ratings question is interesting because Fox, unlike most other or every other cable

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:38.480
news channel, um, they negotiate a fee from every cable subscriber.

02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:41.760
If you have Fox news as a channel, even if you don't watch it, Fox gets a little bit

02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:42.760
of money.

02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:47.800
They are dramatically less dependent on ad revenue than CNN and MSNBC.

02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:52.400
So the ratings question is an interesting one, but Fox's position is different on that.

02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:55.280
Another question from Reddit.

02:13:55.280 --> 02:14:02.240
Both sides are the same in quotes is a meme notion that has spread far and wide in American

02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:04.320
political discourse on the internet.

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:07.340
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this notion?

02:14:07.340 --> 02:14:09.640
And why do you think it is so popular?

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:15.580
Now this Reddit comment also says that podcasts like Russell Brand and Joe Rogan or the legendary

02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:20.480
comic George Carlin are examples of big proponents of this notion.

02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:26.280
All of which I kind of disagree with, uh, Russell Brand, Joe Rogan and George Carlin

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:33.400
claim that both sides are the same and use that, you know, all politicians are crooked

02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:35.000
and they suck and this kind of thing.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.760
I don't know if they're, I don't know if that's true.

02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:39.760
Maybe George Carlin.

02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:41.880
Anyway, let's leave that aside.

02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:47.000
Uh, to what degree do you think, uh, do you agree with this notion that both sides are

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.920
the same left and right?

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:53.360
The crooked corrupt politicians, they do what politicians do.

02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:54.480
I don't agree that it's the same.

02:14:54.480 --> 02:15:01.240
I think there are different factions that like to say that, um, for different reasons.

02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:06.500
There are some individuals who want to present themselves as kind of being above the fray

02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:07.800
of partisan politics.

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:10.720
And so it's, I call it enlightened centrism.

02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:14.720
Um, do you mean that positively or no, I mean it negatively.

02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:15.720
Yeah.

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:16.720
It's, it's a bit of a pejorative.

02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:22.840
The idea that I am not going to fall for being a Democrat or a Republican.

02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:29.000
I can see that these are just two sides of the same coin equally bad lying to every,

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
okay.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.880
So that's one, it's sort of like it's popular at dinner parties in some circles to go, but

02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:37.120
with all these politicians, you know, left and right.

02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:38.800
So that's one side of it.

02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:46.080
The other side of it is that it's often used when, when your side has really stepped in

02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:47.260
it.

02:15:47.260 --> 02:15:55.180
It's a popular way to acknowledge that your side has done something wrong, but while framing

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:59.580
it as it's not uniquely wrong and it's not worse than what anybody else does.

02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:05.980
And I find that it's one of the lamest and most kind of cringe inducing things to hear

02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:09.440
because of the what comes next.

02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:15.500
And usually what comes next is not a good, accurate criticism of something that took

02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:19.140
place and a discussion of how to solve a real problem that we have.

02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:21.420
I find it a conversation stifler.

02:16:21.420 --> 02:16:25.380
It also is used to kind of suppress voter turnout, not actively.

02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:28.440
It's not that the people who say that go around saying don't vote.

02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:32.240
But the idea of course is the more people that believe that it doesn't really make a

02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:35.800
difference who you vote for, it's going to suppress voter turnout.

02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:38.900
And I want voter turnout to be as high as possible, not as low as possible.

02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:41.480
So I also dislike it for that reason.

02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:46.640
So is it possible to say that one side is worse than the other in modern, current political

02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:47.640
climate?

02:16:47.640 --> 02:16:50.880
Listen, I'm a person on the left.

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:56.200
I'm not pretending to come here as, as, and not knowing that my view is biased because

02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:57.200
I'm a person of the left.

02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:59.600
If you ask Ben Shapiro, he'll tell you something different.

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:06.840
I think in 2023, some total, the influence of the American right wing, if the American

02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:12.840
right wing were to get everything it wants, it would be a horrifying reality.

02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:18.200
If the left were to get everything it wants, we'd have to figure out a few things, including

02:17:18.200 --> 02:17:24.360
exactly how we pay for certain programs, but they're mostly noble goals.

02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:30.160
And I believe that they are more supportive of an individual self-determining what they

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:34.780
want to do in life and how they want to live and is more in line with the idea of freedom

02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:38.060
and liberty than what the right is currently proposing.

02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:39.780
That's my view.

02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:43.500
And of course, people will disagree with me and they know we get to freedom and liberty

02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:45.100
the way that the right wants to do it.

02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:47.100
Okay, well, we can have that conversation.

02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:54.900
So I think you've implied in your answer, it was kind of focused on policy.

02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:57.260
It felt like it was focused on policy.

02:17:57.260 --> 02:18:02.420
There's other stuff that people worry about, particularly with the left.

02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:05.980
That may be termed the woke mind virus.

02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:09.660
Where have I heard, who's using that term a lot now?

02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:10.660
I'm trying to think.

02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:11.660
I'm not sure.

02:18:11.660 --> 02:18:12.660
I'm not sure.

02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:15.140
I'm not sure where it comes up.

02:18:15.140 --> 02:18:21.140
But the cultural aspect of this that, you know, if you give a lot of power to people

02:18:21.140 --> 02:18:28.600
on the left, as you gave as an example, there would be a lot of kind of censorship and suppression

02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:37.800
of speech and a kind of dividing up of a society of who is allowed to basically a reallocation

02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:42.760
of resources, not based on merit, but based on some kind of high ethical notions of what

02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:44.160
is right.

02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:50.440
And only a very small percent of the population gets to decide what is fair, what is right,

02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:52.460
which is, you know.

02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:55.760
We already have a small portion of the population deciding fair.

02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:56.760
Okay.

02:18:56.760 --> 02:18:57.760
Yes.

02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:03.840
I don't know how many different ways I can say kind of a negative characterization of

02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:07.880
folks on the left when we're now comparing it just as to play devil's advocate.

02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:08.880
Sure.

02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:10.480
So is there, is that something that you worry about?

02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:14.600
So Paul, the setting policies aside, uh, woke ism.

02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:15.600
Yes.

02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:16.600
How big of a problem is it?

02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:18.040
This is a great conversation.

02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:20.160
So let's do two sides of it.

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.160
Okay.

02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:27.000
We have new polling that seems to suggest so-called woke ism is kind of more popular

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.640
in the United States than anti woke ism.

02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:31.480
And I'll tell you what I mean by that.

02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:32.680
This is the less interesting part.

02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:34.080
We'll go to the more interesting part.

02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:42.040
Second, um, people, sometimes what people mean by woke ism is an overreaction to a perceived

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:48.560
injustice that goes beyond what would be fair and equitable.

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:52.220
There was this really interesting poll and it asked questions like, for example, do you

02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:59.480
society has gone too far, not far enough, or just about the right amount in dealing

02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:03.720
with issues affecting the trans community?

02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:09.980
The woke position, which is society hasn't gone far enough, was far more popular than

02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:11.420
we've gone too far.

02:20:11.420 --> 02:20:14.440
Now the right wing media narrative is we've gone way too far.

02:20:14.440 --> 02:20:16.620
This is out of control.

02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:18.280
And there are lots of other similar answers.

02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:19.360
It's not a huge margin.

02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:23.140
A lot of these are like 58 to 42, 60 to 40.

02:20:23.140 --> 02:20:28.900
It's not like 90 to 10, but by a small margin, the so-called woke perspective of we actually

02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:34.440
haven't yet done enough to fix some of these issues is a little bit more popular.

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:38.800
So if we went back to the Santas, this is part of why I think the Santas is anti woke

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:41.780
agenda may just be a political misstep.

02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:43.120
That's really interesting result.

02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:48.520
I wonder how the questions are framed, but it's still interesting.

02:20:48.580 --> 02:20:56.480
Nevertheless, no matter what, to hear that people are majority of people in America are

02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:59.560
woke and not in the negative sense of the word.

02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:01.080
The poll didn't use the term woke.

02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:02.080
Right.

02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:03.080
Right.

02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:04.080
This is a critical thing.

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:05.080
Let's use the term work positively.

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:08.440
The term has kind of been perverted.

02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:12.200
Four years ago when the term was started to be used, I would have said, oh yeah, woke

02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:19.760
just means like I have become aware of problems that are bigger than any one person can fix

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:23.160
for themselves that relate to the system.

02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:27.240
I think that's and we might disagree on which problems fall into that category, but like

02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:28.320
it was kind of benign.

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:36.120
I think now it just means like outrageously left wing, maybe even with socialist or Marxist

02:21:36.120 --> 02:21:37.120
undertones.

02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:38.520
It's becoming a pejorative at this.

02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:40.400
But also like bullies.

02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:41.840
Sure.

02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.840
Censors.

02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:43.840
Yeah.

02:21:43.840 --> 02:21:51.800
But people that go around calling others racist sometimes, oftentimes without any proof of

02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:52.800
or justification.

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:53.880
Fair.

02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:55.360
But that's worse.

02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:57.400
That's that's a few folks on Twitter.

02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:03.280
You're saying like the polling is starting to show that like, no, they're still most

02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:07.960
of the Americans still care about these issues and want to want to want to improve, want

02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:08.960
to make progress.

02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:12.080
I think that's the case and they want to do it in a genuine way that doesn't suppress

02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:13.240
or oppress anybody.

02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:18.080
But now let me get to like to what degree do I think that actual when it goes too far

02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:19.440
is a problem.

02:22:19.440 --> 02:22:21.440
It absolutely exists.

02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:24.880
We can find instances of where this exists on the left.

02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:32.800
I've been told many times that as a Jewish Argentinian immigrant to the United States,

02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:42.200
I actually don't qualify as oppressed enough because Jews are privileged now in the U.S.

02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:45.640
and my family had just enough money to leave Argentina.

02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:50.000
So there's this kind of like oppression Olympics thing where I've been told you don't get to

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.000
comment.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:57.440
For example, like a topic in the Latino community now is, are you familiar with Latin X?

02:22:57.440 --> 02:22:58.440
OK.

02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:05.160
In Spanish, there's an analogous movement where words by their nature sort of like have

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:06.400
a gender.

02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:10.920
So like the word for friend is amigo.

02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:14.220
But if it's a woman, you would say amiga.

02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:16.940
So right from there, you can tell the gender that we're talking about.

02:23:16.940 --> 02:23:20.160
And if it's a mixed group, you say amigos.

02:23:20.160 --> 02:23:23.800
It's the male with an S, but it could include both.

02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:27.160
There's a movement now which wants to do away with that and put the letter E in.

02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:28.240
It's a new word.

02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:29.240
OK.

02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:30.800
It's a gender neutral word.

02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:31.800
Amigas.

02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:33.440
Totally new.

02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:35.000
I don't like that.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:36.000
And I don't know anyone.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.720
No one in my family uses it.

02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:42.600
And I think it's kind of like a strange imposition from someone kind of with with a solution

02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:44.160
in search of a problem.

02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:48.260
I've been told you moved to the U.S. long ago and like your English is good and like

02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:51.920
you look white and so like you don't get to weigh in on that.

02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:56.120
That I think is an example, if I understand correctly, of the type of thing you're talking

02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:57.120
about.

02:23:58.080 --> 02:23:59.080
I'm being bullied.

02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:00.080
I'm fine.

02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:01.080
I'm surviving fine.

02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:03.080
But I'm being bullied over it and disqualified and saying you don't get to speak on this

02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:04.080
issue.

02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:08.560
All of those example, all of that stuff, I am completely against.

02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:12.480
And I tell people on the left, we're actually hurting our own movement with this stuff.

02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:16.960
I just don't think it's as big as some others believe it's.

02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:20.800
You don't think it's an existential threat to our civilization in the West?

02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:21.800
No, I don't.

02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:24.640
And I mean, look, we've got a Biden administration.

02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:27.120
I see Biden as center left.

02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:29.760
Those who see Biden as extreme far left.

02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:35.080
This stuff has played almost no role whatsoever in the first two plus years of his administration.

02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:38.360
What does people that see him far left as far left?

02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:44.360
There's people on the right who, I mean, Trump says Biden's a Marxist socialist communist.

02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:48.480
I haven't heard that because I don't think that would stick very much.

02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:54.240
He says it at every rally, which I love how jealous that you don't watch these things.

02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:57.160
I love how deeply researched you are in Trump.

02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:00.040
I can only imagine how good your Trump impression is at this point.

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:01.040
It's not very sadly.

02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:02.040
It's not.

02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:03.040
It's not.

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:04.040
All right.

02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:05.040
No, but and I'll say one other thing on that.

02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:08.160
You know, take trans because Trant, just to talk about it a little bit, we haven't dealt

02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:09.440
with it much.

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:13.720
The trans issue has become huge, I believe, because the right is obsessed with it.

02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:16.500
The right is very much not concerned with gay men anymore.

02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:20.600
It used to be that gay men is like, oh, we have to stop gay men from adopting and unnatural

02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:21.880
and pedophiles.

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:23.320
Now it's trans.

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:25.280
It's drag shows, et cetera.

02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:34.200
I do think that there is a fair question to say, how do we deal with trans women in a

02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:37.640
very small short list of sports?

02:25:37.640 --> 02:25:38.640
That's real.

02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:43.760
OK, my view, though, is I go, OK, we have all issues.

02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:47.760
We have issues related to gender and sexual orientation.

02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:50.280
We have issues related to trans.

02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:53.460
In that we have specifically sports.

02:25:53.460 --> 02:25:56.880
You can eliminate from that trans men.

02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:02.040
Nobody's worried, right, about women, biological women who are trans men.

02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:06.760
And then when you say it's only in certain sports that it matters, hey, I'm right there.

02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:08.160
I think it's a complicated question.

02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:09.800
I don't know how we deal with it.

02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:14.780
I would ask leagues that have experience with this already and whatever.

02:26:14.780 --> 02:26:21.860
The problem I have is pretending that the vanguard of left wing politics right now is

02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:26.180
trying to force trans women into sports.

02:26:26.180 --> 02:26:32.620
It's like it's just not the big issue that the right is reacting as if it were.

02:26:32.620 --> 02:26:40.060
But perhaps because of the right, it's forcing the left to to continue discussing it.

02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:46.340
I mean, I feel like it even in institutions, even at universities, it feels like these

02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:54.260
ideas of diversity, inclusion and equity are taking some of the air out of the room of

02:26:54.260 --> 02:26:59.020
what a university should also care about, which is merit.

02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:07.220
It feels like reprioritization is going a little too far the other way, meaning prioritizing

02:27:07.340 --> 02:27:14.140
this kind of amorphous concept that diversity is moving away, is giving power to people

02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:20.020
that don't care about merit and just want to bully people with a big stick that says

02:27:20.020 --> 02:27:26.300
racism or sexism or anti-diversity.

02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:35.580
And it kind of suffocates the people that care about merit, about meritocracy, about

02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:38.620
inspiring people from all kinds of backgrounds to succeed.

02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:40.500
And it's just you kind of observe that.

02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:43.700
I'm sure that happens in all kinds of institutions and the concern.

02:27:43.700 --> 02:27:48.700
I think the people that are concerned about wokeism are concerned about at scale what

02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:56.660
impact does that have on a society when there's so much conversation about racism and oppression

02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:02.460
not to talk about merit, like who's the actual good person in the room, the best person in

02:28:02.460 --> 02:28:03.460
the room.

02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:05.220
Generically, that's a concern to me.

02:28:05.220 --> 02:28:11.380
The degree to which it's happening at different institutions I think is worthy of exploration.

02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:16.580
I know people who work in academia that are getting out of academia because they don't

02:28:16.580 --> 02:28:19.660
like the environment on their campuses for exactly the reason you're saying.

02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:20.740
So it exists.

02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:21.820
There is no question about it.

02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:27.540
I also think that the idea of a perfect meritocracy isn't, is maybe not necessarily the goal in

02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:34.340
the sense that, um, when you talk about perfect meritocracy, someone wrote a book about this

02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:37.900
who I interviewed about a year and a half ago and whose name escapes me.

02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:39.700
There are problems with a perfect meritocracy.

02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:49.540
I think what we want to do is generate roughly equal, um, uh, opportunity for people understanding

02:28:49.540 --> 02:28:55.100
that there is going to be an outcome on a gradient or a bell curve, allowing people

02:28:55.100 --> 02:29:00.100
generally speaking to determine the path that they want to take and giving them if it's

02:29:00.100 --> 02:29:05.500
possible the ability to pursue that without suppressing limiting.

02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:11.700
I mean, this is like relatively uncontroversial stuff among, I would argue 95% of the left

02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:15.060
with the caveats of what you're talking about, which I agree exist.

02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:17.300
It would be nice to know the actual data.

02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:19.580
Sometimes people blow stuff out of proportion.

02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:24.580
What is, it's hard, it's hard to measure how much self-censorship happens at university

02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:25.580
campuses.

02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:26.580
That's true.

02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:31.940
I think also it's sort of like the, the pit bull bite stories thing where when a pit bull

02:29:31.940 --> 02:29:38.100
bites a person, it's more likely to be reported on because it fits a certain narrative.

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:44.060
And there are right wing publications that are very interested in making this seem as

02:29:44.060 --> 02:29:45.740
if it is an epidemic.

02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:49.540
I'm the first to say it is happening to a degree.

02:29:49.540 --> 02:29:51.300
I don't know the degree that it's happening to.

02:29:51.300 --> 02:29:54.700
I know a lot of people in academia, only a couple of them say that it's an issue

02:29:54.700 --> 02:29:59.140
Would they say it though, if they believed it?

02:29:59.140 --> 02:30:01.100
I think they would say it to me.

02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:02.660
These are just personal contacts.

02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:05.220
It's not like I'm going to go blabbing to push back.

02:30:05.220 --> 02:30:12.060
I kind of agree with you, but the same time most, I mean, I'm deeply connected in academia

02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:14.540
of huge number of colleagues.

02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:19.220
Most people self-censor by not thinking about it at all.

02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:20.740
They're like, well, screw it.

02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:21.740
That's deeper.

02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:22.740
Whatever.

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:25.860
They're going to focus on the thing I love doing, which is the work.

02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:32.700
And they don't think about, uh, they basically remove themselves from politics and social

02:30:32.700 --> 02:30:37.100
issues and they just kind of say, I'm going to do my engineering, I'm going to do my mathematics.

02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:38.100
Sure.

02:30:38.100 --> 02:30:41.540
The problem with that is it's kind of, you can't go anywhere further to figure it out.

02:30:41.540 --> 02:30:45.660
It's sort of like, there's this funny clip where Jordan Peterson says, even atheists

02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:46.900
are actually religious.

02:30:46.900 --> 02:30:47.900
They just don't know it.

02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:49.340
And it's like, it's hard to test that.

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:50.340
You know, I don't know.

02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:51.340
Okay.

02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:52.820
But it's a, it's a fair point.

02:30:52.820 --> 02:30:57.260
I mean, there may be some people, if it has become so toxic for some people, they may

02:30:57.260 --> 02:31:01.620
have repressed it way down into their subconscious, but I don't know how we would know that.

02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:08.620
But you, you, you know, symptoms of it because when certain people speak up kind of lightly

02:31:08.620 --> 02:31:14.260
and then a 19 year old or a 20 year old responds and is outraged.

02:31:14.260 --> 02:31:20.140
The fact that the administration listens to that 19 and 20 year old and then reprimands

02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:25.460
whoever spoke up a little bit, that's a really dangerous sign to me.

02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:28.340
And I don't really care about these, like, so I, I'm more with you.

02:31:28.340 --> 02:31:31.300
I don't think it's a big issue, but then I noticed it.

02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:36.140
I wonder, wait a minute, would this kind of environment allow a young Noam Chomsky to

02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:37.140
be around?

02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:43.860
Would this environment allow like, I don't know, like what tenure was designed for, which

02:31:43.860 --> 02:31:49.900
is to have controversial thinkers and not kind of weird controversial thinkers, but

02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:53.420
really people that challenge things that should be challenged.

02:31:53.420 --> 02:31:54.420
Yeah.

02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:56.420
I sympathize with that significantly.

02:31:56.420 --> 02:32:01.780
I always try to look at specific examples and sometimes I'll look at people else.

02:32:01.780 --> 02:32:04.180
I'll ask for them and people will send me five.

02:32:04.180 --> 02:32:07.820
And one of them is a legit bonafide example of what we're talking about.

02:32:07.820 --> 02:32:12.700
And four are kind of like, ah, there was a complaint and it was investigated, but the

02:32:12.700 --> 02:32:14.820
teacher's tenure was never in jeopardy.

02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:19.220
And I don't know that I chalk this up to a big woke event.

02:32:19.220 --> 02:32:23.260
What do you think the kind of apparatus of the four-year degree in college is going to

02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:25.180
look like in 20 years?

02:32:25.180 --> 02:32:31.420
Oh, that's, I mean, we're like day by day, that seems to be changing with GPT.

02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:34.300
I don't know if you've gotten a chance to interact with Chad GPT.

02:32:34.300 --> 02:32:35.300
Absolutely.

02:32:35.300 --> 02:32:39.260
My entire show now is written by Chad GPT.

02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:43.420
I mean, there's a, that's partially a joke.

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:47.220
It is only because it stopped looking at the internet in 2021.

02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:49.500
If it was current, I could completely just tune it out.

02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:51.700
No, I'm kidding, but it's a fascinating tool.

02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:55.980
And it's changing the nature of how we do homework assignments.

02:32:55.980 --> 02:33:00.740
It's changing the nature of how we learn, how we look up new information, how we explore

02:33:00.740 --> 02:33:02.940
information, how we care about things we're interested in.

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:11.740
I think it, I don't think we'll have value for a university degree in 20 years the way

02:33:11.740 --> 02:33:12.740
we do now.

02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:14.380
I just think it changes everything.

02:33:14.380 --> 02:33:22.460
I think language models, Google search has already, and Wikipedia has already transformed,

02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:28.340
I would say our civilization, but it's, there was still a value for basic education.

02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:35.220
I don't, I think that starts to dissipate with Chad GPT, so I don't, I don't know.

02:33:35.220 --> 02:33:39.940
I really, I really don't think there's a university the way we think of a university in 20, 20,

02:33:39.940 --> 02:33:40.940
30 years.

02:33:41.020 --> 02:33:45.340
I mean, I have a personal interest in it in that my daughter is 10 months old and I'm

02:33:45.340 --> 02:33:46.780
doing the 529 account.

02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:52.780
I'm going through the motions as if, but I also recognize, you know, if she went to the

02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:59.340
schools I went to just with the rate of tuition increase, you're talking 200 K a year by the

02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:01.420
time she's 18.

02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:03.660
And what happens with wages relative to that?

02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:07.220
This is like separate from the technological thing.

02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:12.660
And in my mind, I'm thinking, is this going to continue being the right path?

02:34:12.660 --> 02:34:17.580
What I would love to see is so many people that I interact with just by virtue of what

02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:24.180
I do have no foundation in critical thinking, epistemology, philosophy, media literacy.

02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:30.940
And if there were some way to make that the core of some basic education that everybody's

02:34:31.940 --> 02:34:38.260
receiving, which goes beyond, you know, chat GPT can do so many things, but I've not yet

02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:41.420
seen good examples of how it can teach you to think.

02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:47.940
Maybe you have a different view on how chat GBT can teach a user to think, but those skills

02:34:47.940 --> 02:34:51.420
seem to be so lacking in so many of the people I interact with.

02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:55.140
If there's any positive change to come from a changing dynamic with higher education,

02:34:55.140 --> 02:34:57.700
I wish it would be to go in that direction.

02:34:58.220 --> 02:35:05.180
Well, no, chat GPT is actually much better helping me think than any educator, even books

02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:09.980
that I've encountered, because it's very good at presenting the full picture, even better

02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:14.900
than a lot of Wikipedia articles, you know, on questions like did the virus leak from

02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:15.900
a lab?

02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:18.220
Did COVID leak from a lab?

02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:21.740
It just presents to you all the different hypotheses, the amount of evidence available

02:35:21.740 --> 02:35:22.740
to it.

02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:27.580
It's like a full, calm, objective picture of it.

02:35:27.580 --> 02:35:29.060
There's no partisanship.

02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:31.660
It's like a really nice list of things that's available.

02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:38.100
But I guess what I mean is, does it tell you how, as a thinking human, you should evaluate

02:35:38.100 --> 02:35:41.100
the strength of each of the paragraphs it presents to you?

02:35:41.100 --> 02:35:42.100
You can literally ask that question.

02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:43.100
You can ask it to do it.

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.100
Oh, fair.

02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:45.100
Okay.

02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:46.100
Yeah.

02:35:46.100 --> 02:35:50.060
And then it's actually a fun, it's fun to ask chat GPT that question because you'll

02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:52.100
get good answers to that.

02:35:52.100 --> 02:36:01.060
And so you'll basically have a kind of Socratic, like a deep, intimate, like great podcast

02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:07.020
style conversation with an AI system every single day for as many hours as you want,

02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:12.220
especially as it improves and as the interfaces by which you communicate with the thing improves.

02:36:12.220 --> 02:36:17.500
So yeah, I think it will do exactly that, which is teach you how to think because you

02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:26.660
will offload the memory of facts and equations and whatever else school teaches you.

02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:33.380
You'll offload that to AI and instead you'll be using your human mind, which is what it,

02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:40.100
for now, is uniquely good at, which is asking good questions, thinking through the complexities

02:36:40.100 --> 02:36:43.100
of issues when there's multiple perspectives on it, all of that.

02:36:43.100 --> 02:36:44.100
Well then I stand corrected.

02:36:44.100 --> 02:36:47.100
Maybe then I don't know what college is going to be in 20 years.

02:36:47.700 --> 02:36:52.700
Well, but you were sort of commenting, I see, to the financial aspects of it, like, why

02:36:52.700 --> 02:36:55.780
does it even make sense at this point?

02:36:55.780 --> 02:37:03.620
I am thinking about the transformative effects of AI and what starts to ask, what is even

02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:04.620
education?

02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:05.620
Right.

02:37:05.620 --> 02:37:08.940
What are you supposed, what is the purpose of education?

02:37:08.940 --> 02:37:13.800
So one is to give you kind of a background knowledge on a bunch of different topics,

02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:17.680
but the other is to discover the thing you're truly passionate about and the thing you're

02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:22.520
really good at, such that you can make money and you can contribute to society and have

02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:24.280
a fulfilling life.

02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:27.440
Yeah, and also learning to interact with other people.

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:28.440
With that part.

02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:31.960
Relationships are built, socializing, and so many other things as well.

02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:37.640
But is that, you know, that is the big value of university and maybe it should be called

02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:38.940
something else.

02:37:38.940 --> 02:37:41.360
Can you get that for less than 200K a year somewhere else?

02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:42.360
Yeah, no, it's a fair question.

02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:44.120
It's a kind of social club.

02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:47.800
And you know, one of the things I think about also is people who are well connected.

02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:49.720
I mean, this has always been this isn't new, right?

02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:55.320
But if you're well connected and you have a sort of drive towards entrepreneurship and

02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:59.080
doing your own thing and you're not pursuing a field that is very licensing dependent like

02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:05.280
medicine or law, getting started four years earlier with some internships can be a privilege

02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:06.280
in some cases.

02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:11.000
But again, that's that path is available to the people that would likely do well, regardless

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.480
of whether they went to college.

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:17.800
And so it's a very privileged, self-selected group anyway.

02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:20.440
Another question from Reddit.

02:38:20.440 --> 02:38:26.400
Ask David to explain why American style libertarianism is an unserious philosophy.

02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:30.040
I don't know what they mean by American style libertarianism.

02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:38.160
I've talked before about these kind of utopian libertarians where, you know, we have we don't

02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:39.360
have police.

02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:45.360
You just kind of like hire a for-profit company if you want protection.

02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:50.280
And if there's a conflict between two of these private security companies, then I don't know.

02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:51.440
You figure it out somehow.

02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:53.000
So it's almost like anarchism.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.440
Yeah.

02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:58.720
If by I don't know what the question means by that American style libertarianism.

02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:05.360
But in general, my problems with libertarianism, as it is often presented, come from the work

02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:11.200
of sociology as well as human psychology, which is the reality that once you get a group

02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:17.160
that's bigger than one hundred and fifty people, you really have to start centralizing some

02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:23.720
decisions unless you're going to subdivide the one fifty endlessly into two seventy fives

02:39:23.720 --> 02:39:25.500
that now no longer have contact.

02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:27.200
But then that's not really one society.

02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:28.200
Now it's two.

02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:32.840
I've not seen good evidence and I've read a fair bit about this, that once you get beyond

02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:36.920
one fifty, you can keep all decisions decentralized.

02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:42.920
And once you say some things need to be centralized, then it's a matter of how you do it.

02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:47.800
And it's going to be some version of government that conflicts with aspects of libertarianism.

02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:50.120
Well, it could be companies, right?

02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:55.280
It could be it could be more market driven, which is the idea of anarchism, that you're

02:39:55.280 --> 02:40:02.120
not you don't give any centralized entity a monopoly over violence.

02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:08.120
You know, and then if you think that the markets are efficient at delivering, especially in

02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:15.900
this 21st century and beyond, where a market could have perfect information about people.

02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:20.680
So one of the issues is that you can manipulate markets because there's not perfect information.

02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:29.020
But now in the digital age, we can we can be higher bandwidth participants in the market.

02:40:29.020 --> 02:40:33.980
So if you're choosing between different security companies or you're choosing between different

02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:39.820
providers, different services, you can do so more efficiently and more effectively and

02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:41.340
in the digital space.

02:40:41.340 --> 02:40:43.420
So you could kind of imagine it.

02:40:43.420 --> 02:40:48.180
But we haven't successfully done it without governments.

02:40:48.180 --> 02:40:49.180
Yeah.

02:40:49.180 --> 02:40:56.900
And I think there's a practical once you get beyond one fifty, you also start specializing.

02:40:57.060 --> 02:41:01.060
Just as a matter of fact, you don't have everybody isn't growing their own food.

02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:03.580
Some people grow the food and other people do other things.

02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:09.380
And you come across a lot of the problems that started at the agricultural revolution.

02:41:09.380 --> 02:41:13.640
And whether you say that it's a company that's solving it or a government, the problems are

02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:15.100
going to be very similar.

02:41:15.100 --> 02:41:20.100
And I've not read anything that to my satisfaction explains how you deal with that.

02:41:20.100 --> 02:41:25.100
Well, there's underlying principles of libertarianism, which is putting priority at the freedom

02:41:25.140 --> 02:41:26.140
of the individual.

02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:27.140
Right.

02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:29.980
And that's a compelling notion.

02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:30.980
Yeah.

02:41:30.980 --> 02:41:36.620
Whenever I do these various political compass things that put you on two axes on the authoritarian

02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:42.060
libertarian axis, I am way down on the libertarian side as a left libertarian.

02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:51.340
So my tendencies are always anti-authoritarian and towards that option when it makes sense.

02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:53.940
So I sympathize with that a lot.

02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:55.100
Another question from Reddit.

02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:58.380
Ask David what issues he disagrees with you on.

02:41:58.380 --> 02:41:59.380
Is there something?

02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:00.380
I have no idea.

02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:01.380
OK, that's great.

02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:02.380
There you go.

02:42:02.380 --> 02:42:03.380
There's no issues.

02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:04.380
Perfect agreement.

02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:06.420
What's your view on Tesla?

02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:08.100
That's a good opportunity to ask.

02:42:08.100 --> 02:42:13.740
What do you think is the strengths and weaknesses of Elon Musk?

02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:14.740
You mentioned Twitter.

02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:15.940
Have you paid your eight dollars?

02:42:15.940 --> 02:42:16.980
I have not paid my eight dollars.

02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:18.540
I don't see the point in paying for it.

02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:20.180
I have no problem paying for services.

02:42:20.180 --> 02:42:21.540
I use a ton of services.

02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:22.540
I'll try the free.

02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:26.020
I'll go to the paid right now.

02:42:26.020 --> 02:42:33.780
So the way I used to use the verified feed was I would post a tweet and then the next

02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:37.660
day when I review what's going on in my social media, I would look at the replies to the

02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:41.620
tweet, which give me a mix of replies from verified and unverified people.

02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:49.720
But then I also look at the verified and see who that are verified public folks have responded

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:54.560
to me or maybe I want to engage with or whatever the case may be.

02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:58.720
I don't even understand why I would look at the verified feed anymore, so I never do because

02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:01.640
it's random folks who I don't know.

02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:06.120
It sort of lost its utility to me and then yes, I had to interrupt.

02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:12.000
But the idea is if everybody who's human pays the eight dollars, it shows to you that it's

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:13.000
not bots.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:16.680
It's at least humans from the reports about the number of people that have bought the

02:43:16.680 --> 02:43:17.680
blue checkmark.

02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:22.800
I think we may be a thousand years from enough signups in order to make that sort of like

02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:23.800
a reality.

02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:24.800
I don't know.

02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:25.800
That was the idea.

02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:26.800
It's an interesting idea.

02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:33.360
Honestly, from my experience, the obviously I was seeing all sorts of attack comments,

02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:37.520
some of which were, I'm sure from bots, but I'm ignoring all of those comments anyway,

02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:39.400
so it really didn't affect my experience that much.

02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:43.280
I mean, here's the thing about Elon and I say this, people sometimes like David, you

02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:46.520
obviously hate Elon or you obviously love Elon.

02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:50.040
I was an investor in Tesla starting in 2015.

02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:52.320
I've since sold all my shares.

02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:53.860
Great run.

02:43:53.860 --> 02:43:56.600
I'm on my second Tesla right now.

02:43:56.600 --> 02:44:02.440
I probably won't get a third one because I think that electric vehicle technology is

02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:07.580
now maturing such that when my lease is up, I'm going to have many more options with the

02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:09.900
range and charging network that's important to me.

02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:10.900
But I could be wrong.

02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:11.900
Maybe, you know, I don't know.

02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:15.560
I have no the cult of personality around people.

02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:16.600
They mean nothing to me.

02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:19.240
So for me, it's just like people are people.

02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:21.040
Nobody has only good ideas.

02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:22.040
Fine.

02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:27.480
I think that what Elon Musk did, accelerating and pushing forward the battery and electric

02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:30.240
vehicle technology is unbelievable.

02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:36.780
It's it's a it's a one person wrecking ball in the best sense of saying we're not going

02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:39.600
to slow play this and do OK.

02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:42.040
Now Toyota has a Toyota hasn't actually entered.

02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:47.280
Now, whoever, we've got a 90 mile range car and next year it'll be 110.

02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:49.520
And it's just like we're doing this right now.

02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:52.880
You can compete or you can opt out and look at what's happened.

02:44:52.880 --> 02:44:54.080
Fantastic.

02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:58.960
On the Twitter side of things, I don't really get the whole plan.

02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:03.800
I don't know if it started maybe as kind of a goof of some kind and it developed into

02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:05.600
I guess I have to buy it.

02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:09.920
And I think something about it ended up with there was a clause invoked where I think he

02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:12.360
did try to get out of buying it, but then was forced to to some degree.

02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:13.360
He was forced.

02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:19.160
The way Twitter used to work was you followed people and when you looked at your feed, you

02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:24.480
either saw the posts from the people you were following in reverse chronological order or

02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.800
posts from the people you followed algorithmically tailored to what you're most likely to want

02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:31.440
to see.

02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:36.600
And if you didn't follow someone, you generally wouldn't see their posts unless it was like

02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:40.600
a sponsored tweet or someone you follow quoted or retweeted them.

02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:41.600
Fine.

02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:46.880
The for you feed tick tock I believe first had a so-called for you feed.

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:53.240
The idea is this is stuff you might like based on I don't know what either demographic data

02:45:53.240 --> 02:45:55.980
about you, your other habits, whatever.

02:45:55.980 --> 02:45:57.520
And so it's useless to me.

02:45:57.520 --> 02:46:00.320
It's just basically mostly right wing content that that is not interesting.

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:01.320
Why do you think that is?

02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:10.000
So the signals that are used to generate the for you page is looking at all your likes,

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:15.880
all your comments, all your blocks and mutes and all that is show that I mean, I don't

02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:16.880
know what it's looking at.

02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:20.080
OK, so it's supposed to be very pleasant for you.

02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:22.720
I'm sure other people go, wow, this for you thing is awesome.

02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:27.460
And I'll get like if you had insert some right wing or sitting here, they would go Twitter

02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:29.980
used to suppress right wing voices.

02:46:29.980 --> 02:46:34.460
And now finally they're getting the fair shake that they deserve in the for you feed.

02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:41.340
OK, I mean, I wonder if there's left wing folks setting their feelings of Elon aside

02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:43.460
that are enjoying the for you page.

02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:46.500
That's a really important question because it's supposed to be people on the left and

02:46:46.500 --> 02:46:48.500
people on the right should be enjoying the for you page.

02:46:48.500 --> 02:46:49.500
Sure.

02:46:49.500 --> 02:46:50.500
Yeah.

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:53.940
I mean, so for me, my thought on Elon is some incredible successes.

02:46:53.940 --> 02:46:55.460
I don't know about Twitter.

02:46:55.460 --> 02:47:00.380
I do think that I don't believe Elon is a right winger.

02:47:00.380 --> 02:47:07.780
And when you see interviews with him, certainly at least socially and in many ways, culturally

02:47:07.780 --> 02:47:11.260
seems very moderate or even somewhat on the left.

02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:13.700
In my experience, I don't think it's a Elon's a right winger.

02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:15.820
I don't that's not an interesting critique.

02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:22.660
It does seem, though, that throughout the Twitter escapade, he certainly ended up closer

02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:28.620
to some voices that may be influencing him in a particular way that's giving some people

02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:29.620
that impression.

02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:35.020
You know, but as far as like the Elon hate or the Elon love, it's just it's just a person

02:47:35.020 --> 02:47:38.060
who's done some interesting things, some of which I like and some of which I could kind

02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:40.100
of leave, leave aside.

02:47:40.100 --> 02:47:52.220
I have seen folks be drift towards the right more in response to just the viciousness of

02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:53.500
attacks from the left.

02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:54.500
Hmm.

02:47:54.500 --> 02:47:55.500
Like who?

02:47:55.500 --> 02:47:56.500
Well, Elon.

02:47:56.500 --> 02:48:01.900
And so you just you do think he's drifted towards the right in.

02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:07.900
So I don't think at the core, but I think on the surface, I think and I think Joe Rogan

02:48:07.900 --> 02:48:13.980
has as well on the surface because I think maybe you can correct me, but it feels like

02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:18.220
people on the left attack more viciously.

02:48:18.220 --> 02:48:20.220
That has not been my experience.

02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:21.220
What?

02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:22.220
It hasn't?

02:48:22.220 --> 02:48:23.220
No, this.

02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:26.980
So yeah, let me know, because my sense was that they attack people on the left viciously

02:48:26.980 --> 02:48:27.980
as well.

02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:31.620
Left attacks its own because you're not progressive enough.

02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:36.220
You're not, you know, it's just this kind of bullying that happens very intensely.

02:48:36.220 --> 02:48:45.740
No, you're 100 percent right that when the left has attacked me, it's almost as vicious

02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:47.820
as when the right attacks me.

02:48:47.820 --> 02:48:53.540
The difference in my experience is it's a smaller contingent on the left that's willing

02:48:53.540 --> 02:48:57.160
to levy those attacks against me, but I'm on the left.

02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:01.740
So to some degree you could say, well, that that's to be expected.

02:49:01.740 --> 02:49:04.980
There is toxicity on the left, but it's intense, isn't it?

02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:09.460
Like that's what I mean, like the attacks on people who are on the left just you're

02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:10.460
not left enough.

02:49:10.460 --> 02:49:13.180
Yeah, that's no, that's and it is a small number of people.

02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:18.860
I can't deny that that is absolutely, absolutely a real phenomenon.

02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:24.880
And it depending on what sort of topics you take on publicly, you are going to suffer

02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:29.060
the wrath of that to a greater or lesser degree.

02:49:29.060 --> 02:49:32.940
But with all of these things, what I always go back to is, you know, I probably would

02:49:32.940 --> 02:49:36.420
have more disagreements with Rogan today than the last time I was on his show, which was

02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:38.380
like at the beginning of the pandemic.

02:49:38.380 --> 02:49:42.740
But there would be zeal and I've done clips critical of things that he has said, substantive,

02:49:42.740 --> 02:49:48.100
of course, to me, it's sort of like, oh yeah, I could sit down with him and do a podcast

02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:50.500
and it would be zero big deal.

02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:53.500
And I would tell him I stand by everything I said about what you said and I would say

02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:54.500
it to you right now.

02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:59.940
There are people who write to me and go, oh man, things must be really, really tense now.

02:49:59.940 --> 02:50:04.620
If you were to Rogan would never have you on because you disagreed and he loves you.

02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:06.380
I'm sure he's just not thinking of me.

02:50:06.380 --> 02:50:08.620
I'm not the most important thing to Joe Rogan.

02:50:08.620 --> 02:50:13.920
I think both of us would be able to sit down and talk about every one of my criticisms.

02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:17.620
It would not be taken personally and then we would move on and it would be the next

02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:18.620
day.

02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:19.620
You get attacked a lot.

02:50:19.620 --> 02:50:22.620
How do you not let that break you mentally?

02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:25.240
Well, I don't know.

02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:27.100
So let's see.

02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:30.420
I try to, I mean, I'm in a toxic space.

02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:35.820
The news and politics, partisan news and politics, partisan news and politics on the internet

02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:40.620
with a social media component, just completely and totally toxic from a personal perspective.

02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:45.700
When I'm done producing my last show of the week until Monday, I try to completely tune

02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:51.740
out from news and politics altogether and also make an effort to just not look at feedback

02:50:51.740 --> 02:50:53.620
and what's going on.

02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:58.900
I also really limit my visibility.

02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:00.620
I don't need to read every comment.

02:51:00.620 --> 02:51:03.780
I don't need to look at every email or every tweet.

02:51:03.860 --> 02:51:09.300
I have 15 minutes each day where I go through my social media platforms, look at generally

02:51:09.300 --> 02:51:12.140
what has the reaction been?

02:51:12.140 --> 02:51:15.920
Maybe include that in my assessment of how I want to tackle a certain issue if I missed

02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:19.620
a good point or something like that and basically try to move on when something like we've talked

02:51:19.620 --> 02:51:22.060
about at the beginning happens.

02:51:22.060 --> 02:51:23.060
It becomes obsessive.

02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:24.060
I mean, it's unhealthy, right?

02:51:24.060 --> 02:51:27.460
Where I'm going, oh my God, who's attacking me now scrolling.

02:51:27.460 --> 02:51:31.120
It becomes, you know, I'm sweating, it's horrible.

02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:35.760
But I think just like limiting exposure to that and remembering that it is impossible

02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:36.760
to please everybody.

02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:37.760
Yeah.

02:51:37.760 --> 02:51:43.200
And so I'd really rather have fresh, genuine views each day rather than views that are

02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:49.840
sort of like restricted and flattened by what I perceive to be people's preferences.

02:51:49.840 --> 02:51:55.320
So just can you speak a little more to the full process of creating the David Pakman

02:51:55.320 --> 02:51:56.320
show?

02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:59.880
Like what do you wake up because you're doing five shows a week?

02:51:59.880 --> 02:52:03.440
I have the Letterman schedule, which means I do five shows in four days.

02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:07.360
I shoot Monday to Thursday, but we're doing five episodes.

02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:11.440
Basically our guests we schedule in advance.

02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:16.560
I'm picking six to eight stories each day that are, like I said, a blend of stuff I

02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:22.440
think will be interesting, things I want to talk about and things where there's it's being

02:52:22.440 --> 02:52:25.360
discussed at one layer and I want to go deeper on it.

02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:27.520
And I feel like I'm able to do that.

02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:31.920
I choose those stories in the morning, record in the early afternoon, and we put the show

02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:34.320
out by that afternoon.

02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:39.080
What the preparation, what's the, how do you take notes?

02:52:39.080 --> 02:52:41.280
Are you on a sheet of paper?

02:52:41.280 --> 02:52:42.480
No sheets of paper anymore.

02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:43.840
I used to do sheets of paper.

02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:48.160
I found something about it, like it worked, the tactile nature of it.

02:52:48.160 --> 02:52:53.840
It became inconvenient for sharing the notes with my team, but basically we use a wiki

02:52:53.840 --> 02:52:55.320
type system.

02:52:55.320 --> 02:52:58.600
It's called Media Wiki, which is basically like a Wikipedia clone.

02:52:58.600 --> 02:52:59.600
Old school.

02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:00.600
Yeah, old school.

02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:03.080
So we can have pages for every guest, every topic.

02:53:03.080 --> 02:53:04.080
That's interesting.

02:53:04.080 --> 02:53:05.080
I haven't heard that.

02:53:05.080 --> 02:53:06.080
Yeah.

02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:07.080
I don't know anyone else who's using it.

02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:08.360
It works really well.

02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:11.520
It's so fast and it takes up almost no space.

02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:14.480
So it just is a really good tool.

02:53:14.480 --> 02:53:19.240
When my team, you know, when we book a guest and they have notes from the publicist, they'll

02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:21.560
put it in there and then I can access it.

02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:24.520
So I'm basically working off of notes rather than a script.

02:53:24.520 --> 02:53:29.800
I'll pull any audio visual stuff that I want so that that's available.

02:53:29.800 --> 02:53:35.240
And it's I mean, it's really a very seamless, you know, we're doing this every day, four

02:53:35.240 --> 02:53:36.240
days a week.

02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:37.920
And so we have it down to a well-oiled machine.

02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:40.280
Where do you get ideas from?

02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:41.280
Everywhere.

02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:46.640
I have a bunch of subreddits that I follow that I think are talking about interesting

02:53:46.640 --> 02:53:47.640
things.

02:53:47.640 --> 02:53:52.160
I have a curated list for which I still use Twitter and it is very good for this.

02:53:52.160 --> 02:53:56.920
It's a curated private list of journalists that I think are doing interesting work.

02:53:56.920 --> 02:53:58.680
So I'll see what's there.

02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:05.560
Look at the sort of standard news reporting, wire services, AP and Reuters.

02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:11.340
Glance at what everything from Drudge to CNN to whoever is covering that day.

02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:13.600
Look at Google News.

02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:17.080
How do you try to fact check stuff on your show?

02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:19.440
So like, is there sources or is there a process?

02:54:19.440 --> 02:54:25.400
I always try to get to a primary source first and foremost for the facts of the story.

02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:29.320
And then I'll use other tools for background research.

02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:33.840
Oftentimes Wikipedia's footnotes I find to be useful tools.

02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:36.520
Chat GPT is a good one.

02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:41.520
You really have to fact check it, but it'll give you ideas of where to do the fact checking,

02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:42.520
which I think is fantastic.

02:54:42.520 --> 02:54:44.840
Sometimes it gives me information that's flat out wrong.

02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:49.040
And when you ask for the source, it's like, oh yeah, that actually is not real, which

02:54:49.640 --> 02:54:52.560
is part of the process.

02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:56.400
And then when there's like an expertise type of thing, if it's a breaking legal matter,

02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:00.400
I'll just call like a friend who's a lawyer or call a friend who's a doctor or something

02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:03.040
like that if it lends itself to that.

02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:05.920
Let me ask you about the nature of truth.

02:55:05.920 --> 02:55:12.480
Do you think it's becoming more and more difficult to know what is true and will become continuously

02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:16.040
continue to get more difficult, especially with GPT?

02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:23.400
I think the big difficulty is in getting people to agree as to what is a statement of fact

02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:25.480
and what is a statement of opinion.

02:55:25.480 --> 02:55:30.760
I think once we can do that, reasonable people can more or less agree on how to get to the

02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:36.520
truth or if we can't get to it, at least figure out how we would if the information were available.

02:55:36.520 --> 02:55:43.400
But the bigger challenge I'm having is someone will call in with an opinion, but say they

02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:45.680
want to talk about fact.

02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:49.880
And I have to explain to them, you're talking about an opinion and not a fact.

02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:54.920
And this goes back to the lack of critical thinking and lack of media literacy.

02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:57.440
But that's the bigger challenge for me right now.

02:55:57.440 --> 02:56:04.600
But I mean, I think the big statements are always going to be somewhat opinions like

02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:09.720
was the elect was the 2020 election fair?

02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:12.160
I think any answer to that is an opinion.

02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:14.160
I disagree.

02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:16.160
If we define fair.

02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:18.640
Well, yes.

02:56:18.640 --> 02:56:23.840
So then I don't think it's possible to define fair in a way that's not several paragraphs

02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:28.240
where each sentence now has facts, right?

02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:30.400
So what do you mean by fair?

02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.600
Is it who can show up to vote?

02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:35.880
What was the process of how easy it is to vote?

02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:40.920
Was there actual cheating going on in different like what is the evidence of that cheating?

02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:44.280
You have to actually get to the actual details of a thing.

02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:48.640
High level, you know, everything is just going to be an opinion.

02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:56.360
It feels like you can approximate that to be like it's a well-founded opinion.

02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:59.520
Well, most of science is an opinion, even physics is an opinion.

02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:04.680
So like, I think there's a threshold beyond which an opinion becomes like,

02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:08.960
this is a pretty reliable thing to assume for now that this is OK.

02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:09.800
So let me revise.

02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:17.600
So I think maybe better said, I think that the difficulty.

02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:22.640
I mean, it is the process you described is probably the right process and it's exhausting

02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:26.240
for mundane things, and that causes major problems.

02:57:26.240 --> 02:57:28.640
If we were to say.

02:57:28.640 --> 02:57:35.360
Is it better for the economy to have a tax rate on people making over a million dollars?

02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:38.160
That's 20 percent or 50 percent.

02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:41.400
OK, what do we mean by better for the economy?

02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:44.200
It's not an overwhelming task to decide on that.

02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:47.840
We could say, well, we'll say it's better for the economy by looking at what was the

02:57:47.840 --> 02:57:52.480
unemployment rate based on the tax rate on million people earning a million a year and

02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:54.360
what was GDP and whatever.

02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:56.880
OK, we've we've agreed.

02:57:56.880 --> 02:57:58.120
This is a statement.

02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:03.760
We are now in the realm of just determining what is given the parameters that we've established.

02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:06.160
I think that that's that's relatively doable.

02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:12.160
The issue is with the bigger ones like you're talking about, where what do we mean by a

02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:18.640
fair election and fair in whose eyes and but I am with you that it often devolves into

02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:24.640
a conversation about opinions about what is fair rather than an ascertainment of the facts.

02:58:24.640 --> 02:58:31.080
Yeah, and it feels like maybe avoiding some of these big maybe there's some trigger words

02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:34.600
to maybe avoiding them allows you to actually talk about the facts.

02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:41.560
And through that, educate yourself and learn about like whether the virus leak from a lab

02:58:41.560 --> 02:58:45.200
or not to me was always a super interesting question.

02:58:45.200 --> 02:58:47.760
I don't know why everybody got super touchy about it.

02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:54.640
Most of the people I know, colleagues, biologists thought it's pretty good likelihood

02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:57.800
that it leaked from a lab, given everything they just didn't.

02:58:57.800 --> 02:59:00.800
The evidence is not there for either one.

02:59:00.840 --> 02:59:05.640
And so like you should be able to just openly talk about it unless you're in a high

02:59:05.640 --> 02:59:09.760
political office where there could be geopolitical consequences to your statements.

02:59:09.760 --> 02:59:11.320
But in general, it's an interesting question.

02:59:11.320 --> 02:59:12.360
You should be able to talk about it.

02:59:12.360 --> 02:59:17.680
But there's no first of all, there's not many facts around there, unfortunately,

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:22.600
and a lot of very conclusive statements about it, especially in the early days, were just opinions.

02:59:22.600 --> 02:59:29.760
And so you have to. The idea of what is true and not becomes a little even mentioning the

02:59:29.840 --> 02:59:34.680
truth in that context. It feels divisive.

02:59:34.680 --> 02:59:37.360
Yeah, I completely agree with you, which is strange.

02:59:37.360 --> 02:59:39.200
Like you think it shouldn't.

02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:44.920
One of the really good opening questions that I've had work to my advantage when talking

02:59:44.920 --> 02:59:50.320
with people who I know disagree with me about a contentious topic is how do you think we

02:59:50.320 --> 02:59:51.200
would figure out X?

02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:56.400
And it often gets people thinking first collaboratively.

02:59:56.480 --> 03:00:01.080
And obviously we might have very different opinions, but with something like the covid

03:00:01.080 --> 03:00:05.040
lab leak, I think it's an interesting one because if you say, OK, maybe it leaked,

03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:07.320
maybe it didn't. How would we figure that out?

03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:10.640
Who would we trust to weigh in on that? What evidence would count?

03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:12.800
Now we're kind of on the same team.

03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:18.680
And then if we can establish that, then we're on a search for a capital T truth together

03:00:18.680 --> 03:00:20.760
or whatever. It's kind of pie in the sky.

03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:23.400
But in some conversations, I've actually had success with that.

03:00:23.640 --> 03:00:29.200
And then you can kind of realize if if there's no amount of evidence that's going to prove

03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:34.440
a show to you that you're wrong in your current opinion, that that's probably a really bad

03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:35.440
sign for you.

03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:38.760
It's a waste. It may be a waste to pursue the conversation further at that point.

03:00:38.760 --> 03:00:39.760
Yeah. Yeah.

03:00:39.760 --> 03:00:43.320
What? Oh, so, OK, you think Trump was a good president.

03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:47.840
How do you determine that and what evidence might exist that would change your mind?

03:00:47.840 --> 03:00:50.200
There is no evidence Trump was the best president ever.

03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:52.120
I think the conversation is probably done.

03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:53.800
Abraham Lincoln, all right.

03:00:55.120 --> 03:00:56.680
You mentioned Israel, Palestine.

03:00:56.680 --> 03:01:00.040
Well, what do you think about the situation in Israel and Palestine and something you've

03:01:00.040 --> 03:01:02.560
thought about spoken about for quite a time?

03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:04.840
Do you think we'll ever see peace in this part of the world?

03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:08.880
I don't know. I mean, I could say yes.

03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:09.880
That's the answer.

03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:10.880
I could say yes.

03:01:10.880 --> 03:01:19.120
I the you know, one of the problems is and I'll give you may not know that the there

03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:24.960
are people on the left of my audience who call me a Netanyahu shill, even though I've

03:01:24.960 --> 03:01:30.560
never been a supporter of Netanyahu and I'm on the left, I just don't think that some

03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:38.840
of the kind of black and white characterizations about Israel are even remotely accurate.

03:01:38.840 --> 03:01:42.360
And I think most people it's become a sort of litmus test.

03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:43.960
Are you criticizing Israel enough?

03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:45.960
Are you showing us that you're actually left wing?

03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:46.960
I don't do any of that stuff.

03:01:47.040 --> 03:01:49.240
I really look at the situation for what it is.

03:01:49.240 --> 03:01:54.160
That's become a litmus test in American politics and the spectrum of American politics.

03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:55.160
Yes.

03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:08.360
My view, big picture, is that I don't think we're going to really get anywhere until some

03:02:08.360 --> 03:02:15.880
pre negotiated terms are set and the parties to do the negotiating are all good faith parties.

03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:21.600
For example, I don't think Israel's right wing party, Likud, is a particularly good

03:02:21.600 --> 03:02:28.200
faith arbiter of peace because I think Likud benefits from there not being peace and the

03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:30.080
threat of violence.

03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:31.080
And there is violence.

03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:32.600
It's not just the threat of violence.

03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:38.680
I don't think Hamas is going to be an arbiter of peace for the Palestinian people either.

03:02:38.680 --> 03:02:40.880
I think the Palestinian Authority is a question mark.

03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:42.200
I'm not sure.

03:02:42.200 --> 03:02:48.520
So I think that there need to be some preconditions that would need to be set with regard to everything

03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:52.200
from settlements to a lot of this minutiae.

03:02:52.200 --> 03:02:57.000
Big picture, though, if I imagine what the most likely solution looks like, it doesn't

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:58.440
mean it's a perfect solution.

03:02:58.440 --> 03:02:59.840
And obviously it's a solution.

03:02:59.840 --> 03:03:02.680
Many people will say it's not it's not going to happen.

03:03:02.680 --> 03:03:07.360
I think it's a solution where the borders are similar to what was being discussed in

03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:15.560
the Clinton era to some degree, as many of the settlements as possible have to go, understanding

03:03:15.560 --> 03:03:19.080
that some of the bigger ones are just not going to go and there's going to have to be

03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:25.120
meaningful land swaps with which Yasser Arafat seemed to be amenable to when he weighed in

03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:26.120
on it.

03:03:26.120 --> 03:03:27.640
I believe it was in the 90s.

03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:33.540
The topic of the Temple Mount and Jerusalem, et cetera, is a complicated one.

03:03:33.540 --> 03:03:40.660
But I think that almost certainly East Jerusalem is going to have to be part of an eventual

03:03:40.660 --> 03:03:41.660
Palestinian state.

03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:45.740
You know, I mean, like we can go as kind of as far as we want to with a lot of this stuff.

03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:50.860
What role does U.S. have to play in this coming to the table with good faith parties?

03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:56.620
I don't know whether I go back and forth between believing that the U.S. should play a big

03:03:57.620 --> 03:04:04.540
to the U.S. should play essentially no role whatsoever because, of course, of the funding

03:04:04.540 --> 03:04:10.680
of Israel that the U.S. provides, will the you I don't it's not that I have a personal

03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:15.340
problem with American involvement and somebody like Bill Clinton was arguably relatively

03:04:15.340 --> 03:04:17.900
well positioned to try to make something happen.

03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:22.100
It's more just will there will it be seen as credible on the global stage?

03:04:22.100 --> 03:04:25.080
And that's, I think, the most important thing, because at the end of whatever negotiation

03:04:25.080 --> 03:04:31.720
takes place, both sides need to agree that this is where we are renouncing all past claims.

03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:35.760
And in the future, if there's a disagreement, we can't go back to that thing from the 80s

03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:36.760
or the 90s.

03:04:36.760 --> 03:04:37.760
That's just like a critical piece of this.

03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:48.760
Yeah, it has to be stable and, you know, materialize it to something stable over years.

03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:50.640
Yes.

03:04:50.640 --> 03:04:55.960
Another difficult conflict going on in the world is the war in Ukraine.

03:04:55.960 --> 03:05:00.200
What do you think about the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022?

03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:03.400
I don't pretend to be an expert on this issue.

03:05:03.400 --> 03:05:06.800
I think you probably know more about this than I do just from the brief conversation

03:05:06.800 --> 03:05:12.960
we had before we started filming my view as a general observer of geopolitics and the

03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:16.920
way that this area, this part of the world is related to American presidents over the

03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:22.840
last several, you know, cycles is I don't think it's controversial to say that this

03:05:22.840 --> 03:05:30.040
was a war of aggression, an invasion of aggression, an act of aggression by Vladimir Putin.

03:05:30.040 --> 03:05:41.040
I do believe that if Trump had been reelected, Putin may have seen himself as having other

03:05:41.520 --> 03:05:48.520
tools with which to try to expand influence that may have been different than geographical

03:05:48.520 --> 03:05:51.960
pursuits, geographic pursuits.

03:05:51.960 --> 03:05:55.080
But we don't know that for sure.

03:05:55.080 --> 03:06:01.080
I also have a really hard time imagining what the end of this looks like.

03:06:01.080 --> 03:06:09.880
And that's very scary because sometimes the most benign end seems to be that Putin ends

03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:16.880
up out of power either through no longer being alive or deposed in some way.

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.560
It doesn't feel like that ladder is super likely.

03:06:20.560 --> 03:06:22.560
The former there's reports about his health.

03:06:22.560 --> 03:06:24.500
I don't know how accurate they are.

03:06:24.500 --> 03:06:31.500
It's just hard to imagine a face saving exit that is going to be even remotely.

03:06:33.160 --> 03:06:34.160
What's the word?

03:06:34.160 --> 03:06:38.600
It's not even a question of acceptable, just it's not satisfying either.

03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:42.320
Just not tragic, I guess, is what I'm looking for.

03:06:42.320 --> 03:06:47.040
In terms of Putin speaking to the Russian people and being able to figure out what to

03:06:47.040 --> 03:06:50.240
say, what kind of narrative to say why this war made sense.

03:06:50.240 --> 03:06:51.240
Yes.

03:06:51.240 --> 03:06:55.640
And the same on the Ukrainian side to figure out how to exit this war.

03:06:55.640 --> 03:06:56.640
Yes.

03:06:56.640 --> 03:07:03.760
I mean, to some degree, it requires Russian troops leaving Ukraine and that is somewhat

03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:04.760
under the control.

03:07:04.920 --> 03:07:10.060
I mean, of course, it's not up to Ukraine whether the initiative continues.

03:07:10.060 --> 03:07:16.880
But what I am not thrilled with are some of the reflexive, you know, if Trump had been

03:07:16.880 --> 03:07:24.680
in power instead of Joe Biden, a lot of the reflexive comments about, oh, you're if you,

03:07:24.680 --> 03:07:30.480
if you say Ukraine is just acting defensively, you're supporting neo-Nazis or some of these

03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:35.480
things that have come out of the American Republican Party seem both wacky and like

03:07:35.480 --> 03:07:38.840
they would be saying completely different things if Trump happened to be in the Oval

03:07:38.840 --> 03:07:39.840
Office.

03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:41.800
They're really proxy attacks on Joe Biden.

03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:42.800
Yeah.

03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:49.200
Well, that in some sense, Ukraine is also kind of political litmus test of how you speak

03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:56.000
about it, I think, because of the huge amount of funding that's going from U.S. to Ukraine.

03:07:57.000 --> 03:08:02.160
Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to it seems to me that this topic

03:08:02.160 --> 03:08:03.960
has become politicized already.

03:08:03.960 --> 03:08:04.960
Hundred percent.

03:08:04.960 --> 03:08:08.300
There are people like Marjorie Taylor Green and others saying we should be doing nothing

03:08:08.300 --> 03:08:09.300
for Ukraine.

03:08:09.300 --> 03:08:13.400
Zelensky is a comedian and we're supporting neo-Nazis.

03:08:13.400 --> 03:08:14.400
That's it.

03:08:14.400 --> 03:08:15.400
Full stop.

03:08:15.400 --> 03:08:18.060
And you either subscribe to that or you don't.

03:08:18.060 --> 03:08:23.680
And it very quickly becomes it very quickly becomes as partisan as so many other issues.

03:08:23.680 --> 03:08:28.480
And it's really the most disappointing thing is that some of these issues become incredibly

03:08:28.480 --> 03:08:30.800
devices, divisive, but they're simple.

03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:33.540
Like for example, a conspiracy theory that we know isn't true.

03:08:33.540 --> 03:08:36.420
It shouldn't be divisive, divisive because it's so simple.

03:08:36.420 --> 03:08:39.900
Other issues become divisive and they are simplified.

03:08:39.900 --> 03:08:44.340
But in reality, they are extraordinarily complex and you lose the ability to talk about the

03:08:44.340 --> 03:08:47.560
complexity because they're becoming partisan.

03:08:47.560 --> 03:08:52.000
Do you think there will always be war in the world as a bunch of folks on the subreddit

03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:56.640
that were interested in your different complex perspectives on foreign policy.

03:08:56.640 --> 03:08:58.760
So let's talk about war.

03:08:58.760 --> 03:09:02.200
You look at the war in Ukraine.

03:09:02.200 --> 03:09:04.200
You look at what's going on in Israel and Palestine.

03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:06.600
You look at the wars across the world.

03:09:06.600 --> 03:09:08.320
Do you think there will always be war?

03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:13.160
As a Redditor put it, is it a necessary evil in the game of geopolitics?

03:09:13.160 --> 03:09:20.720
I used to have what I now believe is an extremely naive perspective, which is that if we somehow

03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:27.880
if intelligent aliens arrived here, it would be so momentous for homo sapiens that all

03:09:27.880 --> 03:09:33.080
of our differences would immediately be exposed to so insignificant.

03:09:33.080 --> 03:09:36.640
We would never fight again and we would realize that intelligent life.

03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:42.000
And then I spoke to people who deal in space exploration and other other scientists and

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.560
they all said that David, that's extraordinarily naive.

03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:49.300
There would be a period during which this was as momentous as you're imagining and then

03:09:49.300 --> 03:09:51.180
it would become normal.

03:09:51.180 --> 03:09:55.780
And then we would go back to many of the same conflicts that we have now, sectarian, et

03:09:55.780 --> 03:09:56.780
cetera.

03:09:56.780 --> 03:10:04.500
I think that in all likelihood, there will always be conflict between factions, whether

03:10:04.500 --> 03:10:07.740
it's what we currently think of as war.

03:10:07.740 --> 03:10:08.740
Probably not.

03:10:08.740 --> 03:10:14.180
I mean, it seems as though the tactics will evolve and it will be less about missiles

03:10:14.180 --> 03:10:16.380
and I don't know where it's going to go.

03:10:16.420 --> 03:10:20.860
I don't know whether it's going to become more biological or cyber or certainly something

03:10:20.860 --> 03:10:25.700
we haven't even considered yet, but I think there will always be conflicts we would refer

03:10:25.700 --> 03:10:26.700
to in that way.

03:10:26.700 --> 03:10:33.500
Do you agree with Chomsky on his general harsh criticism of U.S. foreign policy in war that

03:10:33.500 --> 03:10:40.380
many actions, military actions in the United States are criminal in nature, almost terrorist

03:10:40.380 --> 03:10:41.460
in nature?

03:10:41.460 --> 03:10:43.620
I am not.

03:10:43.620 --> 03:10:49.020
It's been a decade or more since I've read any Chomsky and I don't keep up with everything

03:10:49.020 --> 03:10:54.420
that he has recently said, so I don't want to mischaracterize any of it.

03:10:54.420 --> 03:11:01.420
In general, Americans are sold the view that we're the good guys spreading freedom across

03:11:01.420 --> 03:11:02.420
the world.

03:11:02.420 --> 03:11:07.340
And no, Chomsky takes a perspective that, yeah, but if you look at the number of civilians

03:11:07.340 --> 03:11:11.380
you kill while doing it, it's incomparable to any other military actions across the world.

03:11:11.380 --> 03:11:12.380
Right.

03:11:12.380 --> 03:11:20.300
So I very much disagree with those who take the view that the U.S. is this wonderful global

03:11:20.300 --> 03:11:25.860
police force that's spreading democracy and fixing problems very, very much wrong.

03:11:25.860 --> 03:11:30.300
I think where I've had disagreements with Chomsky in the past is more he framed.

03:11:30.300 --> 03:11:36.200
He seems to frame the U.S. as a uniquely bad actor in some of these cases.

03:11:36.200 --> 03:11:42.740
And I think it's more an outcropping of the size and wealth of the U.S. and less about

03:11:42.740 --> 03:11:45.260
uniquely negative intentions.

03:11:45.260 --> 03:11:49.360
And so I think that would be my general disagreement with Chomsky based on stuff I read a decade

03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:50.360
ago.

03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:54.520
Well, he says that he lives in the United States, he's an American, and so he feels

03:11:54.520 --> 03:11:57.040
his focus of criticism should be in America.

03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:02.280
And I think that's one of the great things about being an American and being in America

03:12:02.280 --> 03:12:04.880
is the freedom to criticize harshly.

03:12:04.880 --> 03:12:05.880
Sure.

03:12:06.560 --> 03:12:12.240
While being a university professor, by the way, he's basically the embodiment of why

03:12:12.240 --> 03:12:14.040
ten years is a really valuable thing.

03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:15.040
I agree.

03:12:15.040 --> 03:12:17.360
Whether you agree with him or not.

03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:19.880
Question from Reddit.

03:12:19.880 --> 03:12:23.440
Ask David what he plans for his garden this year.

03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:24.440
Is this a joke?

03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:25.440
It's not a joke.

03:12:25.440 --> 03:12:27.640
I got into gardening a few years ago.

03:12:27.640 --> 03:12:32.520
Honestly, with the baby, I can't do a garden this year.

03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:35.520
And I have a lot of travel coming up, so everything would die.

03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:38.280
But I did start to try to figure out gardening.

03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:43.400
If you're stressed by the toxicity of the social media world, gardening is a great hobby.

03:12:43.400 --> 03:12:45.300
It really is.

03:12:45.300 --> 03:12:47.040
But it is extraordinarily time consuming.

03:12:47.040 --> 03:12:50.000
So I have no garden planned this year.

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:57.160
Other books or maybe movies in your life that had a big impact on you that, you know, you're

03:12:57.160 --> 03:13:00.920
thinking about that diet.

03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:02.240
Has there been stuff you read?

03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:11.920
Even just books, like blogs or writers or just sources of information that molded you

03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:17.040
into the intellectual, into the political thinker that you are.

03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:18.640
It's so hard.

03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:22.480
This is sort of like, you know, you win an Oscar and you want to make sure you thank

03:13:22.480 --> 03:13:23.480
all the right people.

03:13:23.480 --> 03:13:28.120
I read so much and have been reading for so long that it's really hard to say.

03:13:28.200 --> 03:13:39.280
I think certainly for me, narrative nonfiction has been a fantastic genre to learn not only

03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:43.160
about history, but also about people and psychology.

03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:48.040
And very often when people say, I don't really read, like, what can you recommend to me that

03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:50.360
might be interesting?

03:13:50.360 --> 03:13:55.440
Depending on, you know, knowing them to some degree, I'll give recommendations there in

03:13:55.520 --> 03:14:01.440
terms of just things I picked up recently that I think are interesting.

03:14:01.440 --> 03:14:05.040
I've been reading a bunch of Neil Postman.

03:14:05.040 --> 03:14:11.200
I read a Jenny O'Dell has a new book on time and the concept of like saving time, spending

03:14:11.200 --> 03:14:12.200
time, etc.

03:14:12.200 --> 03:14:14.120
She just published it.

03:14:14.120 --> 03:14:15.120
Super interesting.

03:14:15.120 --> 03:14:23.640
I just read Lansing's book about the Shackleton voyage in Antarctica in 1914, 15 and 16.

03:14:23.640 --> 03:14:24.640
Super interesting.

03:14:24.640 --> 03:14:25.920
I'm really all over the map.

03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:28.640
I have that one on audiobook I've been meaning to listen to.

03:14:28.640 --> 03:14:30.000
It's very interesting.

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:34.600
And it seems inconceivable how these guys survived, completely inconceivable.

03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:37.200
And yet they did.

03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:42.560
It kind of inspires you to think of space exploration and taking on similar kinds of

03:14:42.560 --> 03:14:44.960
risky and dangerous journeys.

03:14:44.960 --> 03:14:47.040
In narrative nonfiction, I grew with you very much.

03:14:47.040 --> 03:14:53.680
I've been reading a lot of 20th century history about Stalin and about Hitler.

03:14:53.680 --> 03:14:58.560
As in Follow the Third Reich, I've read twice now and I recommend it.

03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:04.560
What did you get out of reading at the second time?

03:15:04.560 --> 03:15:14.160
So the second time I listened to the audiobook as I ran, I get the same thing from it as

03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:21.480
I get maybe reading Man's Search for Meaning, which is all the troubles of day to day in

03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:30.240
the modern world kind of fade away and dissipate when I'm thinking about the, you know, basically

03:15:30.240 --> 03:15:35.960
the embodiment of evil at scale at that recent time in human history.

03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:40.320
So it makes me sort of appreciate all the, it fills me with gratitude to have all the

03:15:40.320 --> 03:15:44.840
freedoms, all the just simple joys of life that we have today.

03:15:44.840 --> 03:15:51.800
And I think the second time I was, as I was reading it, because William Shire was there,

03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:55.840
he's the author, he was there through the whole thing, you start to pick up little details

03:15:55.840 --> 03:16:03.960
as opposed to like big things, you start to pick up the little quirks of how history turns

03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:06.180
and just like these little events.

03:16:06.180 --> 03:16:11.040
You notice the dynamics between people in a room during a meeting with Hitler.

03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:14.440
You just notice these little things that are mentioned because he was either there

03:16:14.440 --> 03:16:16.960
directly or heard it the next day.

03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:21.240
So you get, that's why to me, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is interesting is because

03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:29.840
it's by a guy who was there, who's reporting on it versus a sort of a more distant, displaced

03:16:29.840 --> 03:16:30.840
retelling.

03:16:30.840 --> 03:16:35.040
And also like biographies, I'm a big fan of biographies.

03:16:35.040 --> 03:16:39.760
And Walter Isaacson has just written some incredible ones and Steve Jobs and Einstein,

03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:42.320
all that kind of stuff.

03:16:42.320 --> 03:16:45.800
Victor Frankl's book is one I've read a bunch of times and it's so short.

03:16:45.800 --> 03:16:49.600
And you know, reading in general, I know a lot of people who read way more than I do.

03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:51.760
And I also know a lot of people who don't read at all.

03:16:51.760 --> 03:16:54.960
I mean, they haven't read a book since college, essentially.

03:16:54.960 --> 03:17:00.040
To me, it's almost like the amount I get from it, it's almost like a secret weapon where

03:17:00.040 --> 03:17:05.320
when I think, you know, in two or three or 400 pages, which I can read in whatever, 10

03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:12.080
or however long it takes reading 30 pages a day, the amount of information insights

03:17:12.080 --> 03:17:17.600
into so many aspects of the human psyche that I can get, it's sort of like, it's not like

03:17:17.600 --> 03:17:20.560
I'm in a competition for anything in particular with anybody.

03:17:20.560 --> 03:17:25.040
I just do my show, but it's sort of like, if I'm reading dozens of books a year and

03:17:25.040 --> 03:17:31.440
you're reading zero, I'm exposed to so many different things and ideas that are not even

03:17:31.440 --> 03:17:32.560
in your universe.

03:17:32.560 --> 03:17:35.840
It just seems like the power of reading just seems overwhelming.

03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:42.320
And I had, speaking of getting attacked, I had a fun time getting attacked a few months

03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:44.960
ago for publishing a reading list.

03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:52.720
So I'm reading at least a book a week, read 18 or 19 books from the beginning of the year.

03:17:52.720 --> 03:17:55.680
You got attacked for the books you chose or for this?

03:17:55.680 --> 03:17:59.320
I don't know for what, but it became quite viral.

03:17:59.320 --> 03:18:01.320
Attacked for reading?

03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:03.320
That's something.

03:18:03.320 --> 03:18:08.760
So it's basically what happened is that people, I actually don't, it's not worth, folks who

03:18:08.760 --> 03:18:13.240
know, no, folks who don't even worry about it.

03:18:13.240 --> 03:18:18.600
What I really loved about being attacked for it is it shows that you can get attacked for

03:18:18.600 --> 03:18:19.600
anything.

03:18:19.600 --> 03:18:20.600
Apparently.

03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:22.280
So it's not like I did something wrong.

03:18:22.280 --> 03:18:30.520
It was kind of a beautiful thing and it was just the most intensely beautiful display

03:18:30.520 --> 03:18:35.440
of absurdity of Twitter and the internet that there would be, there were articles written

03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:38.960
about me with a book list.

03:18:38.960 --> 03:18:40.960
There's no bad books on it.

03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:47.440
The thing I was being mocked for is reading Dostoevsky, reading stuff that sounds like

03:18:47.440 --> 03:18:48.840
a high school reading list.

03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:50.040
Oh, I see.

03:18:50.040 --> 03:18:57.120
Or all these kinds of aspects of the reading list, which doesn't stand up to any sort of

03:18:57.600 --> 03:19:02.400
kind of criticism, but the fact that people are just looking for single words, a single

03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:08.640
aspects of a tweet and so on to criticize, it actually forced me to, cause I released

03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:14.280
a video about, you know, summarizing my takeaway from one of the books and I've been meaning

03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:19.960
to do more and more, but every time I started to like want to record it, I have this negative

03:19:19.960 --> 03:19:20.960
feeling.

03:19:20.960 --> 03:19:23.440
They kind of ruin the fun of sharing with others.

03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:25.340
I know exactly what you're talking about.

03:19:25.340 --> 03:19:29.060
My advice on that is don't do it.

03:19:29.060 --> 03:19:30.060
Just don't record it.

03:19:30.060 --> 03:19:31.060
Yeah.

03:19:31.060 --> 03:19:35.820
Because, and, and is that what you, yeah, but I, I think time cures it, but for now

03:19:35.820 --> 03:19:36.820
I decided not to.

03:19:36.820 --> 03:19:37.820
Yes.

03:19:37.820 --> 03:19:41.180
It's just until I'm, until I feel joy when I do it.

03:19:41.180 --> 03:19:46.100
We are in such a privileged position to even be able to do this sort of thing, right?

03:19:46.100 --> 03:19:51.440
I have taken on projects and then it sort of sounds good or I end up doing it because

03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:56.680
party that brings the idea and I feel like I can't really say no or whatever.

03:19:56.680 --> 03:19:59.880
And then when I get in front of the camera or I have to write something for a while,

03:19:59.880 --> 03:20:03.520
I did a newspaper column that I hated doing.

03:20:03.520 --> 03:20:08.840
I realized that I'm ruining the exact thing that I have worked to build, which is that

03:20:08.840 --> 03:20:10.480
I can just do whatever I want.

03:20:10.480 --> 03:20:11.480
Why am I doing this?

03:20:11.480 --> 03:20:13.160
And sometimes it takes me a week to realize it.

03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:16.640
Sometimes it takes me a year, but just don't do it.

03:20:16.640 --> 03:20:21.120
That's in this case in particular, it's also that there's a private thing I enjoy, which

03:20:21.120 --> 03:20:23.160
is reading, right?

03:20:23.160 --> 03:20:29.040
And if sharing that private thing you enjoy is not fun, then just don't share it.

03:20:29.040 --> 03:20:34.400
That that's yeah, there's certain things, there's certain private things that should

03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:36.280
remain private.

03:20:36.280 --> 03:20:38.640
That's like, which is one of the first things ever.

03:20:38.640 --> 03:20:44.080
I'm, I'm the same person privately as I am publicly, but the books, it's like, man, I

03:20:44.080 --> 03:20:48.240
don't get to share, I guess through these conversations, I can share some of the stuff

03:20:48.320 --> 03:20:51.440
I'm reading and enjoying it because it sucks.

03:20:51.440 --> 03:20:56.400
It sucks to get attacked for stuff and it sucks to get attacked for stuff you love.

03:20:56.400 --> 03:20:57.400
Yeah, especially reading.

03:20:57.400 --> 03:21:01.240
I mean, it's, you know, that's the, the bottom of the barrel.

03:21:01.240 --> 03:21:07.120
I have these ideas where I'll go, you know, maybe for my next thing, I'll go from politics,

03:21:07.120 --> 03:21:08.120
which is so toxic.

03:21:08.120 --> 03:21:12.600
I'll go to travel blogging because I, there's so many travel bloggers I follow and there's

03:21:12.600 --> 03:21:14.340
so many interesting places.

03:21:14.340 --> 03:21:16.040
And then I go, wait a second.

03:21:16.120 --> 03:21:18.280
I like traveling and just hanging out.

03:21:18.280 --> 03:21:21.760
Now traveling is going to be my job and now I've got to bring two cameras with me and

03:21:21.760 --> 03:21:25.320
I've got to get shots and I've got to film my food and I'm not going to do that.

03:21:25.320 --> 03:21:29.280
I'm just going to do what I'm doing, but then I'll travel when I want to take a vacation.

03:21:29.280 --> 03:21:31.320
Of course, some of it could be fun.

03:21:31.320 --> 03:21:38.160
I mean, I have to say when I did one video on a book in 1984, I really enjoyed it.

03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:39.400
That whole process was fun.

03:21:39.400 --> 03:21:47.120
It was, I don't think I've ever thought as hard about a book when I had to make a video

03:21:47.120 --> 03:21:48.120
about it.

03:21:48.120 --> 03:21:51.800
Cause I had to like, you know, I read 1984, I don't know how many times, probably five,

03:21:51.800 --> 03:21:52.800
10 times.

03:21:52.800 --> 03:21:53.800
I don't remember.

03:21:53.800 --> 03:22:00.600
I read Animal Farm way more, but I don't think I was like, what do I think about, like what

03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:02.320
are the key takeaways for me?

03:22:02.320 --> 03:22:03.320
I didn't really know.

03:22:03.320 --> 03:22:07.160
Like if you ask me what I think about even Animal Farm, cause I haven't done that one

03:22:07.160 --> 03:22:10.520
and I've read that one, I don't know, over 50 times.

03:22:10.520 --> 03:22:11.880
It's probably my favorite book.

03:22:11.880 --> 03:22:16.800
It's like, I would have to struggle and making a video about it, basically a little mini

03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:22.120
lecture forced me to actually have an opinion about the details of it and to do enough research

03:22:22.120 --> 03:22:25.760
to think like, okay, what is the historical context of this book?

03:22:25.760 --> 03:22:31.080
I mean, it allowed me to say interesting and to think interesting stuff about the book.

03:22:31.080 --> 03:22:36.800
I found it to be really rewarding to basically the old Feynman thing, one of the best ways

03:22:36.800 --> 03:22:38.080
to learn is to teach.

03:22:38.080 --> 03:22:39.080
Yeah.

03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:43.720
I can't think of one thing I would say about Animal Farm and I read it again, not that

03:22:43.720 --> 03:22:45.200
long ago, but I don't know what comments-

03:22:45.200 --> 03:22:52.240
You kind of have a generic comment like authoritarianism and so on, whatever, but there could be interesting

03:22:52.240 --> 03:22:57.240
quirks of the book and the characters and how corruption happens.

03:22:57.240 --> 03:23:02.800
You could say all kinds of stuff that it may be contrasting it, like even when 1984 allowed

03:23:02.800 --> 03:23:11.280
me to contrast with Brave New World and how that 1984 was politicized and how it's used

03:23:11.280 --> 03:23:13.120
by the Republican Party of today.

03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:16.880
You could say a lot of interesting stuff if you think about it and write it down on a

03:23:16.880 --> 03:23:17.880
sheet of paper.

03:23:17.880 --> 03:23:19.240
Maybe you don't need to make a video about it.

03:23:19.240 --> 03:23:25.200
I found it to be really rewarding in general, so I probably will do more of it, but not

03:23:25.200 --> 03:23:28.080
always, not as a main profession, just like with the travel blogging.

03:23:28.080 --> 03:23:29.080
I agree with that.

03:23:29.720 --> 03:23:31.240
I mean, you get threatened a lot.

03:23:31.240 --> 03:23:32.760
You get attacked a lot online.

03:23:32.760 --> 03:23:35.320
Do you think about your mortality?

03:23:35.320 --> 03:23:39.240
Well, the other day I went to the doctor and he said, you know, next physical, we're going

03:23:39.240 --> 03:23:44.920
to be talking about a lot of new things, and so I was thinking about it a lot that day.

03:23:44.920 --> 03:23:48.360
No, I mean, it's funny.

03:23:48.360 --> 03:23:54.520
I recently did a bunch of estate stuff, and when you have intellectual property, there's

03:23:54.520 --> 03:24:01.560
a question of like, OK, I have my assets, but also if I died tomorrow, especially in

03:24:01.560 --> 03:24:07.560
a particularly fiery death, my YouTube channel would probably for a while generate more money

03:24:07.560 --> 03:24:11.560
because it would be like, oh, my goodness, this person died in a terrible what happens

03:24:11.560 --> 03:24:13.800
with a future revenue stream and all these different things.

03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:19.240
And it got me thinking about legacy and about the fact that people who do this sort of thing,

03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:21.800
it's kind of a new thing in a sense.

03:24:21.800 --> 03:24:26.280
And so, you know, if you work at ABC News, at some point you just retire and someone

03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:27.400
else fills in for you.

03:24:28.520 --> 03:24:32.760
How does my career wind down given like I don't actually know the answer?

03:24:32.760 --> 03:24:33.400
I'm not sure.

03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:35.240
What is it?

03:24:35.240 --> 03:24:41.720
I just one day stop posting videos, but all my content stays up, getting fewer and fewer

03:24:41.720 --> 03:24:42.280
views.

03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:44.120
Or do I delete everything?

03:24:44.120 --> 03:24:44.600
Do I?

03:24:45.160 --> 03:24:45.640
I don't know.

03:24:45.640 --> 03:24:46.920
What what is the lie?

03:24:46.920 --> 03:24:51.080
I mean, so you my trip to Ukraine because I knew I was going to the front is the first

03:24:51.080 --> 03:24:58.680
time I did I record a video if I die and I posted it and I give instructions to to folks

03:24:58.680 --> 03:24:59.160
what to do.

03:24:59.960 --> 03:25:03.800
So like there's a closure, but it's an interesting process.

03:25:03.800 --> 03:25:10.120
Like what happens to your at which point the GPT take over the continued tweeting for David

03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:10.600
Patrick?

03:25:10.600 --> 03:25:14.920
Well, the tweeting I care less about right now, unless blue becomes something unbelievable,

03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:16.520
I'm less worried about Twitter.

03:25:16.520 --> 03:25:20.600
But some of my audience members have been saying, you know, some of these tools, David

03:25:20.600 --> 03:25:27.880
are getting good enough that we could clone your voice and also make it match video.

03:25:28.680 --> 03:25:33.160
And with scripts, you could just keep pumping out content, even if you were gone.

03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:36.040
And I said, now that I'm interested in that, I want to learn more about.

03:25:37.720 --> 03:25:39.320
Boy, it's going to be a weird future.

03:25:40.200 --> 03:25:44.200
What advice do you have to young folks that are facing this future?

03:25:45.160 --> 03:25:51.880
Almost always it's some version of start right away, and that applies in so many different

03:25:51.880 --> 03:25:52.680
ways.

03:25:52.680 --> 03:25:57.400
So if you're thinking about oftentimes the context is people want to do what I do.

03:25:57.400 --> 03:26:01.720
And I always say, do not sit around for a year thinking about lighting.

03:26:02.920 --> 03:26:04.280
This is how you never do anything.

03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:09.400
And I dozens of people who I felt obligated to talk to on the phone because of a personal

03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:14.680
connection, I go through all the advice and I can tell they're not going to do it.

03:26:14.680 --> 03:26:15.880
They just there.

03:26:15.880 --> 03:26:17.640
It's already sounding too complicated.

03:26:17.640 --> 03:26:20.920
And so instead they'll sort of say, well, I got to get the right lighting and the right

03:26:20.920 --> 03:26:22.520
room and blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:26:22.520 --> 03:26:25.800
The best thing you can do, no matter what you're doing, is just start right away.

03:26:25.800 --> 03:26:28.920
And that applies in this business and in whatever else you're doing.

03:26:28.920 --> 03:26:34.760
If you want to learn a new thing, find a new hobby, the ability to get data right away

03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:38.280
about what's working, what's not working, and whether you even like this approach that

03:26:38.280 --> 03:26:42.280
you're taking is so valuable and it will allow you to iterate.

03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:46.360
And the sooner you do it, the cost to a change of direction will also be lower.

03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:51.080
If there's any, I don't do like self-help or generic advice type stuff, but the one

03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:57.320
thing that applies in so many situations is just try it right away and iterate from there.

03:26:57.960 --> 03:27:00.840
Yeah. Start today and then do it every day.

03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:02.920
Or decide, hey, you know what?

03:27:02.920 --> 03:27:04.440
I figured out I don't actually want to do it.

03:27:05.720 --> 03:27:07.080
Yeah. Hence iterate.

03:27:07.080 --> 03:27:07.560
Yeah.

03:27:07.560 --> 03:27:09.800
Well, usually you'll discover you do.

03:27:12.200 --> 03:27:16.120
Do you think we'll make it out of the century, humanity, human civilization?

03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:18.280
Out of the, so like to 2100?

03:27:18.280 --> 03:27:19.800
Yeah. How much we got? 80 years?

03:27:20.520 --> 03:27:24.440
Yeah. 77. I think we're going to make it.

03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:25.080
You think so?

03:27:25.080 --> 03:27:25.720
Yeah.

03:27:25.720 --> 03:27:29.960
What are the biggest threats facing our civilization, if not wokeism?

03:27:30.920 --> 03:27:33.080
If it's not wokeism, it's hard to say.

03:27:33.080 --> 03:27:43.640
No, I actually think that if you believe that we are on an inflection point of sorts

03:27:43.640 --> 03:27:49.640
in changes to society and acceleration of technology, et cetera, I think it's really

03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:55.960
tough to know in 2090 what will actually be the biggest threat. So I don't know. It's so cliche

03:27:55.960 --> 03:28:01.880
to say nuclear and climate change and another pandemic.

03:28:01.880 --> 03:28:07.080
Technologically, our world might look so different. It's almost unimaginable. What

03:28:07.080 --> 03:28:13.800
it means to be human is unimaginable. And also the degree that we make progress out into space

03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:15.960
is also unimaginable.

03:28:15.960 --> 03:28:20.360
I think space is super interesting and there's people on both the left and right who, for

03:28:20.360 --> 03:28:25.480
different reasons, are kind of not into the whole space exploration thing. The people I hear from,

03:28:25.480 --> 03:28:30.280
the ones on the right, think it's just kind of dumb. The ones on the left think it's an

03:28:30.280 --> 03:28:32.120
excuse not to fix problems here.

03:28:33.240 --> 03:28:39.160
And also they say it's the plaything of billionaires, which is another funny kind of

03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:39.800
concept.

03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:45.480
Yeah. I mean, someone's got to pay for it. Why not be people who have a lot of money to-

03:28:45.480 --> 03:28:49.560
You can either be billionaires or governments that are trillionaires.

03:28:50.120 --> 03:28:54.120
Somebody has to pay for big, ambitious moonshot projects.

03:28:54.120 --> 03:29:00.760
To me, the most interesting thing is that in getting closer to the next step of space

03:29:00.760 --> 03:29:07.560
exploration, we may well learn things that can then be used to improve circumstances here.

03:29:07.560 --> 03:29:14.920
For me, it's not one or the other. And I recently read a long piece about why not Mars because

03:29:14.920 --> 03:29:17.880
it's terrible in every way for supporting life.

03:29:17.960 --> 03:29:24.280
Okay. So like that's one perspective, but still in so exploring who knows what we might end up

03:29:24.280 --> 03:29:28.840
learning. So I'm, I'm big on it. I don't share the view of some on the left about it.

03:29:28.840 --> 03:29:33.000
So I guess to add to your advice to young people, if a thing seems terrible, you still

03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:34.200
might want to consider doing it.

03:29:34.200 --> 03:29:39.800
I would say so. Yeah. How many things have seen, I mean, listen, there are so many trips where

03:29:40.440 --> 03:29:49.000
the day before I say, why am I doing this? The jet lag, I've got to do this and that.

03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:54.520
And now who, if my guest host falls through, I should just stay in work. And I go, hold on,

03:29:55.480 --> 03:30:00.680
you do this every time. Yep. Just go. You never regret it. You learn something. You try something.

03:30:00.680 --> 03:30:01.800
I never regret the trip.

03:30:04.520 --> 03:30:09.480
This hopefully applies to the conversation we had today. David, I'm a big fan of yours.

03:30:09.480 --> 03:30:13.800
Thank you so much for talking today. Thank you for being patient with me. We tried to

03:30:13.800 --> 03:30:19.320
talk earlier. Please continue doing what you're doing. Please continue being objective and

03:30:19.320 --> 03:30:24.440
thoughtful and fearless. Thank you. On the internet. Big fan of yours as well. I appreciate it.

03:30:25.480 --> 03:30:29.720
Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Pakman. To support this podcast,

03:30:29.720 --> 03:30:34.680
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:30:34.680 --> 03:30:41.000
Mahatma Gandhi. What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless,

03:30:41.640 --> 03:30:47.720
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or in the holy name of

03:30:47.720 --> 03:30:53.960
liberty or democracy? Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
