00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
The jury found Pfizer guilty of fraud

00:02.920 --> 00:04.560
and racketeering violations.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.520
How does Big Pharma affect your mind?

00:06.520 --> 00:08.800
Everyone's allowed their own opinion.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.360
I don't think everyone's allowed

00:10.360 --> 00:11.920
their own scientific facts.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.800
Does Pfizer play by the rules?

00:13.800 --> 00:16.440
Pfizer isn't battling the FDA.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.780
Pfizer has joined the FDA.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.320
The following is a conversation with John Abramson,

00:24.320 --> 00:26.520
faculty at Harvard Medical School,

00:26.520 --> 00:29.160
a family physician for over two decades,

00:29.200 --> 00:32.160
and author of the new book, Sickening,

00:32.160 --> 00:35.040
about how Big Pharma broke American healthcare

00:35.040 --> 00:37.400
and how we can fix it.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.240
This conversation with John Abramson

00:40.240 --> 00:43.720
is a critical exploration of the pharmaceutical industry.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.440
I wanted to talk to John

00:45.440 --> 00:48.200
in order to provide a countervailing perspective

00:48.200 --> 00:50.740
to the one expressed in my podcast episode

00:50.740 --> 00:55.120
with the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Burla.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.960
And here, please allow me to say a few additional words

00:58.960 --> 01:01.880
about this episode with the Pfizer CEO,

01:01.880 --> 01:04.840
and in general, about why I do these conversations

01:04.840 --> 01:06.820
and how I approach them.

01:06.820 --> 01:10.520
If this is not interesting to you, please skip ahead.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.080
What do I hope to do with this podcast?

01:13.080 --> 01:15.600
I want to understand human nature,

01:15.600 --> 01:18.040
the best and the worst of it.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.840
I want to understand how power, money,

01:19.840 --> 01:21.860
and fame changes people.

01:21.860 --> 01:24.620
I want to understand why atrocities are committed

01:24.620 --> 01:27.240
by crowds that believe they're doing good.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.320
All this, ultimately,

01:29.320 --> 01:30.760
because I want to understand

01:30.760 --> 01:33.280
how we can build a better world together,

01:33.280 --> 01:35.440
to find hope for the future,

01:35.440 --> 01:40.440
and to rediscover each time through the exploration of ideas

01:40.920 --> 01:43.380
just how beautiful this life is.

01:43.380 --> 01:47.680
This, our human civilization, in all of its full complexity,

01:47.680 --> 01:49.320
the forces of good and evil,

01:49.320 --> 01:52.340
of war and peace, of hate and love.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.600
I don't think I can do this with a heart and mind

01:55.640 --> 01:57.360
that is not open, fragile,

01:57.360 --> 02:01.000
and willing to empathize with all human beings,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.500
even those in the darkest corners of our world.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.840
To attack is easy.

02:06.840 --> 02:09.600
To understand is hard.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.880
And I choose the hard path.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.920
I have learned over the past few months

02:13.920 --> 02:17.400
that this path involves me getting more and more attack

02:17.400 --> 02:19.080
from all sides.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.680
I will get attacked when I host people

02:21.680 --> 02:24.560
like Jay Bhattacharya or Francis Collins.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.200
Jamie Merzel or Vincent Racinello.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.920
When I stand for my friend Joe Rogan.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.800
When I host tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg,

02:34.800 --> 02:36.480
Elon Musk, and others.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.640
When I eventually talk to Vladimir Putin,

02:39.640 --> 02:42.040
Barack Obama, and other figures

02:42.040 --> 02:43.940
that have turned the tides of history.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
I have, and I will, get called stupid, naive, weak,

02:50.900 --> 02:52.600
and I will take these words

02:52.600 --> 02:55.440
with respect, humility, and love,

02:55.440 --> 02:57.280
and I will get better.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.760
I will listen, think, learn, and improve.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.800
One thing I can promise

03:02.800 --> 03:05.400
is there's no amount of money or fame

03:05.400 --> 03:09.340
that can buy my opinion or make me go against my principles.

03:09.340 --> 03:13.560
There's no amount of pressure that can break my integrity.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.200
There's nothing in this world I need

03:16.200 --> 03:18.600
that I don't already have.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.500
Life itself is the fundamental gift.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.480
Everything else is just a bonus.

03:24.540 --> 03:26.660
That is freedom.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.700
That is happiness.

03:28.700 --> 03:31.720
If I die today, I will die a happy man.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.980
Now, a few comments about my approach

03:35.980 --> 03:39.580
and lessons learned from the Albert Berla conversation.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.860
The goal was to reveal as much as I could

03:41.860 --> 03:43.920
about the human being before me,

03:43.920 --> 03:45.940
and to give him the opportunity

03:45.940 --> 03:49.900
to contemplate in long form the complexities of his role,

03:49.900 --> 03:53.180
including the tension between making money

03:53.180 --> 03:54.620
and helping people,

03:54.620 --> 03:58.180
the corruption that so often permeates human institutions,

03:58.180 --> 04:00.820
the crafting of narratives through advertisements,

04:00.820 --> 04:02.380
and so on.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.060
I only had one hour,

04:04.060 --> 04:07.460
and so this wasn't the time to address these issues deeply,

04:07.460 --> 04:10.220
but to show if Albert struggled with them

04:10.220 --> 04:12.220
in the privacy of his own mind,

04:12.220 --> 04:16.260
and if he would, let down the veil of political speak

04:16.260 --> 04:19.420
for a time to let me connect with a man

04:19.420 --> 04:22.540
who decades ago chose to become a veterinarian,

04:22.540 --> 04:24.340
who wanted to help lessen the amount

04:24.340 --> 04:26.300
of suffering in the world.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.380
I had no pressure placed on me.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.780
There were no rules.

04:29.780 --> 04:32.140
The questions I was asking were all mine

04:32.140 --> 04:34.140
and not seen by Pfizer folks.

04:34.140 --> 04:38.700
I had no care whether I ever talked to another CEO again.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.820
None of this was part of the calculation

04:41.820 --> 04:44.140
in my limited brain computer.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.940
I didn't want to grill him.

04:45.940 --> 04:48.920
The way politicians grill CEOs in Congress,

04:48.960 --> 04:51.440
I thought that this approach is easy,

04:51.440 --> 04:56.280
self-serving, dehumanizing, and it reveals nothing.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.040
I wanted to reveal the genuine intellectual struggle,

04:59.040 --> 05:01.440
vision, and motivation of a human being,

05:01.440 --> 05:02.720
and if that fails,

05:02.720 --> 05:05.840
I trusted the listener to draw their own conclusion

05:05.840 --> 05:08.120
and insights from the result,

05:08.120 --> 05:10.120
whether it's the words spoken

05:10.120 --> 05:14.520
or the words left unspoken or simply the silence.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.840
And that's just it.

05:15.840 --> 05:20.840
I fundamentally trust the intelligence of the listener, you.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.880
In fact, if I criticize the person too hard

05:24.880 --> 05:26.840
or celebrate the person too much,

05:26.840 --> 05:29.760
I feel I fail to give the listener a picture

05:29.760 --> 05:32.800
of the human being that is uncontaminated

05:32.800 --> 05:35.440
by my opinion or the opinion of the crowd.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.600
I trust that you have the fortitude

05:38.600 --> 05:41.080
and the courage to use your own mind,

05:41.080 --> 05:43.280
to empathize and to think.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.320
Two practical lessons I took away.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.760
First, I will more strongly push for longer conversations

05:49.760 --> 05:53.400
of three, four, or more hours versus just one hour.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.960
60 minutes is too short for the guest to relax

05:55.960 --> 05:58.240
and to think slowly and deeply,

05:58.240 --> 06:00.840
and for me to ask many follow-up questions

06:00.840 --> 06:02.920
or follow interesting tangents.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.840
Ultimately, I think it's in the interest of everyone,

06:05.840 --> 06:07.080
including the guest,

06:07.080 --> 06:11.560
that we talk in true long form for many hours.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.840
Second, these conversations with leaders

06:13.840 --> 06:16.920
can be aided by further conversations with people

06:16.920 --> 06:20.440
who wrote books about those leaders or their industries,

06:20.440 --> 06:22.440
those that can steal man each perspective

06:22.440 --> 06:25.160
and attempt to give an objective analysis.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.840
I think of Teddy Roosevelt's speech

06:26.840 --> 06:28.560
about the man in the arena.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.400
I want to talk to both the men and women in the arena

06:32.400 --> 06:36.120
and the critics and the supporters in the stands.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.920
For the former, I lean toward wanting to understand

06:38.920 --> 06:43.400
one human beings struggle with the ideas.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.000
For the latter, I lean towards understanding

06:46.000 --> 06:48.440
the ideas themselves.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.360
That's why I wanted to have this conversation

06:50.360 --> 06:51.800
with John Abramson,

06:51.800 --> 06:55.640
who is an outspoken critic of the pharmaceutical industry.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.880
I hope it helps add context and depth

06:58.880 --> 07:02.360
to the conversation I had with the Pfizer CEO.

07:02.360 --> 07:06.720
In the end, I may do worse than I could have or should have.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.080
Always, I will listen to the criticisms without ego

07:10.080 --> 07:13.640
and I promise I will work hard to improve.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.960
But let me say finally, that cynicism is easy.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.640
Optimism, true optimism is hard.

07:24.520 --> 07:28.400
It is the belief that we can and we will build

07:28.400 --> 07:32.720
a better world and that we can only do it together.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.040
This is the fight worth fighting.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.520
So here we go.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.200
Once more into the breach, dear friends.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.120
I love you all.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.920
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.040
To support it, please check out our sponsors

07:46.040 --> 07:47.320
in the description.

07:47.320 --> 07:51.320
And now, here's my conversation with John Abramson.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.240
Your faculty at Harvard Medical School,

07:55.240 --> 07:57.840
your family physician for over two decades,

07:57.840 --> 08:01.160
rated one of the best family physicians in Massachusetts.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.440
You wrote the book, Overdosed America,

08:03.440 --> 08:07.400
and the new book coming out now called Sickening,

08:07.400 --> 08:10.120
about how Big Pharma broke American healthcare,

08:10.120 --> 08:14.760
including science and research and how we can fix it.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.760
First question, what is the biggest problem with Big Pharma

08:18.760 --> 08:21.840
that it fixed would be the most impactful?

08:21.840 --> 08:24.960
So if you can snap your fingers and fix one thing,

08:24.960 --> 08:26.800
what would be the most impactful, you think?

08:26.800 --> 08:30.080
The biggest problem is the way they

08:31.080 --> 08:36.080
determine the content, the accuracy, and the completeness

08:36.800 --> 08:41.800
of what doctors believe to be the full range of knowledge

08:41.800 --> 08:45.280
that they need to best take care of their patients.

08:45.280 --> 08:50.280
So that with the knowledge having been taken over

08:50.760 --> 08:52.080
by the commercial interests,

08:52.080 --> 08:55.240
primarily the pharmaceutical industry,

08:55.240 --> 08:58.760
the purpose of that knowledge is to maximize the profits

08:59.520 --> 09:03.320
that get returned to investors and shareholders,

09:03.320 --> 09:07.240
and not to optimize the health of the American people.

09:07.240 --> 09:11.440
So rebalancing that equation would be the most important

09:11.440 --> 09:14.720
thing to do to get our healthcare back

09:14.720 --> 09:16.440
aimed in the right direction.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.680
Okay, so there's a tension between helping people

09:20.680 --> 09:22.280
and making money.

09:22.280 --> 09:26.400
So if we look at particularly the task of helping people

09:26.400 --> 09:30.600
in medicine, in healthcare, is it possible

09:30.600 --> 09:35.440
if money is the primary sort of mechanism

09:35.440 --> 09:38.320
by which you achieve that as a motivator,

09:38.320 --> 09:39.840
is it possible to get that right?

09:39.840 --> 09:43.160
I think it is, Lex, but I think it is not possible

09:43.160 --> 09:46.760
without guardrails that maintain the integrity

09:46.760 --> 09:48.760
and the balance of the knowledge.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.040
Without those guardrails, it's like trying to play

09:52.040 --> 09:54.920
a professional basketball game without referees

09:54.920 --> 09:57.600
and having players call their own fouls.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.920
But the players are paid to win,

09:59.920 --> 10:02.400
and you can't count on them to call their own fouls.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.080
So we have referees who are in charge.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.160
We don't have those referees in American healthcare.

10:08.160 --> 10:13.160
That's the biggest way that American healthcare

10:13.800 --> 10:17.520
is distinguished from healthcare in other wealthy nations.

10:17.520 --> 10:20.560
So, okay, so you mentioned Milton Fridman,

10:20.560 --> 10:24.240
and you mentioned his book called Capitalism and Freedom.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.240
He writes that there are only three legitimate functions

10:27.240 --> 10:30.120
of government to preserve law and order,

10:30.120 --> 10:31.840
to enforce private contracts,

10:31.840 --> 10:35.800
and to ensure that private markets work.

10:36.840 --> 10:40.160
You said that that was a radical idea at the time,

10:40.160 --> 10:41.840
but we're failing on all three.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.720
How are we failing?

10:43.720 --> 10:46.720
And also maybe the bigger picture is,

10:46.720 --> 10:49.680
what are the strengths and weaknesses of capitalism

10:49.680 --> 10:51.880
when it comes to medicine and healthcare?

10:51.880 --> 10:53.160
Can we separate those out

10:53.160 --> 10:55.200
because those are two huge questions.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.120
So how we're failing in all three,

10:58.120 --> 11:01.280
and these are the minimal functions

11:01.280 --> 11:05.360
that our guru of free market capitalism

11:05.360 --> 11:07.640
said the government should perform.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.120
So this is the absolute baseline.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.760
On preserving law and order,

11:13.760 --> 11:17.520
the drug companies routinely violate the law

11:17.520 --> 11:20.200
in terms of their marketing,

11:20.200 --> 11:25.200
and in terms of their presentation

11:26.400 --> 11:29.240
of the results of their trials.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.960
I know this because I was an expert in litigation

11:32.960 --> 11:34.680
for about 10 years.

11:35.880 --> 11:40.040
I presented some of what I learned in civil litigation

11:40.040 --> 11:42.480
to the FBI and the Department of Justice,

11:42.480 --> 11:46.360
and that case led to the biggest criminal fine

11:46.360 --> 11:49.920
in US history as of 2009.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.520
I testified in a federal trial in 2010,

11:56.080 --> 12:00.000
and the jury found Pfizer guilty of fraud

12:00.000 --> 12:02.360
and racketeering violations.

12:02.360 --> 12:07.360
In terms of violating the law, it's a routine occurrence.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.800
The drug companies have paid $38 billion worth of fines

12:10.800 --> 12:14.480
from, I think, 1991 to 2017.

12:15.160 --> 12:20.160
It's never been enough to stop the misrepresentation

12:21.360 --> 12:25.640
of their data, and rarely are the fines greater

12:25.640 --> 12:27.280
than the profits that were made.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.840
See, executives have not gone to jail

12:31.840 --> 12:36.400
for misrepresenting data that have involved

12:36.400 --> 12:39.000
even tens of thousands of deaths in the case

12:39.000 --> 12:42.120
of Vioxx, OxyContin as well.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.520
When companies plead guilty to felonies,

12:45.520 --> 12:48.360
which is not an unusual occurrence,

12:48.360 --> 12:51.240
the government usually allows the companies,

12:51.240 --> 12:54.600
the parent companies, to allow subsidiaries

12:54.600 --> 12:58.880
to take the plea so that they are not one step closer

12:58.880 --> 13:01.280
to getting disbarred from Medicare,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.360
not being able to participate in Medicare.

13:05.480 --> 13:10.480
In that sense, there is a mechanism

13:11.000 --> 13:15.040
that is appearing to impose law and order

13:15.040 --> 13:18.160
on drug company behavior, but it's clearly not enough.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.480
It's not working.

13:19.480 --> 13:24.480
Can you actually speak to human nature here?

13:24.600 --> 13:26.320
Are people corrupt?

13:26.320 --> 13:28.400
Are people malevolent?

13:28.400 --> 13:32.880
Are people ignorant that work at the low level

13:32.880 --> 13:36.480
and at the high level at Pfizer, for example,

13:36.480 --> 13:38.640
at big pharma companies?

13:38.640 --> 13:40.440
How is this possible?

13:41.280 --> 13:43.320
I believe, just on a small tangent,

13:43.320 --> 13:45.400
that most people are good.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.960
I actually believe if you join big pharma,

13:48.960 --> 13:52.640
so a company like Pfizer, your life trajectory

13:52.640 --> 13:56.360
often involves dreaming and wanting

13:56.360 --> 13:58.240
and enjoying helping people.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.880
Then we look at the outcomes that you're describing.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.440
That's why the narrative takes hold

14:09.440 --> 14:13.200
that Pfizer's CEO, Al Bobrola, who I talked to,

14:13.200 --> 14:15.480
is malevolent.

14:15.480 --> 14:20.040
The sense is these companies are evil.

14:20.040 --> 14:24.560
If the different parts, the people, are good

14:24.560 --> 14:25.760
and they want to do good,

14:25.760 --> 14:28.000
how are we getting these outcomes?

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
I think it has to do with the cultural milieu

14:33.160 --> 14:34.680
that this is unfolding in.

14:35.320 --> 14:40.320
And we need to look at sociology to understand this,

14:41.440 --> 14:46.440
that when the cultural milieu is set up

14:49.320 --> 14:52.560
to maximize the returns on investment

14:52.560 --> 14:55.440
for shareholders and other venture capitalists

14:55.440 --> 14:57.520
and hedge funds and so forth,

14:57.520 --> 15:00.640
when that defines the culture

15:00.640 --> 15:04.240
and the higher up you are in the corporation,

15:04.280 --> 15:09.280
the more you're in on the game of getting rewarded

15:10.120 --> 15:13.080
for maximizing the profits of the investors.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.880
That's the culture they live in.

15:15.800 --> 15:19.720
And it becomes normative behavior

15:19.720 --> 15:23.440
to do things with science

15:23.440 --> 15:26.920
that look normal in that environment

15:26.920 --> 15:30.000
and are shared values within that environment

15:30.000 --> 15:34.920
by good people whose self-evaluation becomes modified

15:34.920 --> 15:37.680
by the goals that are shared by the people around them.

15:39.080 --> 15:44.080
And within that milieu, you have one set of standards

15:44.760 --> 15:48.720
and then the rest of good American people

15:48.720 --> 15:50.760
have the expectation that the drug companies

15:50.760 --> 15:52.320
are trying to make money,

15:52.320 --> 15:55.280
but that they're playing by rules

15:55.280 --> 15:58.480
that aren't part of the insider milieu.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.400
That's fascinating.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.640
The game they're playing modifies the culture

16:06.240 --> 16:09.400
inside the meetings, inside the rooms, day to day,

16:10.560 --> 16:12.560
that there's a bubble that forms.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.600
We're all in bubbles of different sizes.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.280
And that bubble allows you to drift

16:18.280 --> 16:23.000
in terms of what you see as ethical and unethical,

16:24.160 --> 16:27.840
because you see the game as just part of the game.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.520
So marketing is just part of the game.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.280
Paying the fines is just part of the game of science.

16:36.520 --> 16:41.520
And without guardrails, it becomes even more part of the game.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.640
You keep moving in that direction

16:44.640 --> 16:48.160
if you're not bumping up against guardrails.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.880
And I think that's how we've gotten

16:49.880 --> 16:52.200
to the extreme situation we're in now.

16:53.400 --> 16:58.160
So like I mentioned, I spoke with Pfizer CEO, Albert Berola,

16:58.200 --> 17:01.000
and I'd like to raise with you

17:01.000 --> 17:02.960
some of the concerns I raised with him.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.200
So one, you already mentioned,

17:06.200 --> 17:08.320
I raised the concern that Pfizer's engaged

17:08.320 --> 17:11.240
in aggressive advertising campaigns.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.280
As you can imagine, he said no.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.560
What do you think?

17:18.480 --> 17:20.360
I think you're both right.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.760
I think that the, I agree with you,

17:23.760 --> 17:26.320
that the aggressive advertising campaigns

17:27.320 --> 17:30.120
do not add value to society.

17:30.120 --> 17:34.560
And I agree with him that they're for the most part legal

17:34.560 --> 17:36.560
and it's the way the game is played.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.200
Right, so sorry to interrupt,

17:38.200 --> 17:41.800
but oftentimes his responses are,

17:44.400 --> 17:47.160
especially now, he's been CEO for only like two years,

17:47.160 --> 17:50.040
three years, he says Pfizer was a different company,

17:50.040 --> 17:53.400
we've made mistakes, right, in the past.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.120
We don't make mistakes anymore.

17:55.880 --> 17:59.840
That there's rules and we play by the rules.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.280
So like with every concern raised,

18:02.280 --> 18:05.520
there's very, very strict rules, as he says.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.040
In fact, he says sometimes way too strict

18:08.040 --> 18:09.720
and we play by them.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.720
And so in that sense, advertisement,

18:11.720 --> 18:13.880
it doesn't seem like it's too aggressive

18:13.880 --> 18:15.680
because it's playing by the rules.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.320
And relative to the other, again, it's the game,

18:19.320 --> 18:21.720
relative to the other companies,

18:21.720 --> 18:24.240
it's actually not that aggressive.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.960
Relative to the other big pharma companies.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.720
Yes, I hope we can quickly get back to

18:29.720 --> 18:32.760
whether or not they're playing by the rules in general.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.360
But let's just look at the question

18:34.360 --> 18:36.640
of advertising specifically.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.600
I think that's a good example of what it looks like

18:39.600 --> 18:43.120
from within that culture and from outside that culture.

18:44.880 --> 18:49.800
He's saying that we follow the law on our advertising,

18:49.800 --> 18:51.520
we state the side effects

18:51.520 --> 18:53.960
and we state the FDA approved indications

18:54.560 --> 18:57.720
and we do what the law says we have to do for advertising.

18:57.720 --> 19:02.720
And I have not been an expert in litigation for a few years

19:02.960 --> 19:04.960
and I don't know what's going on currently,

19:04.960 --> 19:07.080
but let's take him at his word.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.920
It could be true, it might not be, but it could be.

19:09.920 --> 19:14.920
But if that's true, in his world, in his culture,

19:15.480 --> 19:17.280
that's ethical business behavior.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.560
From a common sense person's point of view,

19:22.560 --> 19:27.200
a drug company paying highly skilled media folks

19:27.200 --> 19:30.440
to take the information about the drug

19:30.440 --> 19:34.400
and create the illusion, the emotional impact

19:34.400 --> 19:38.000
and the takeaway message for viewers of advertisements

19:38.000 --> 19:41.200
that grossly exaggerate the benefit of the drug

19:41.200 --> 19:45.400
and minimize the harms, it's sociopathic behavior

19:45.400 --> 19:49.960
to have viewers of ads leave the ad

19:49.960 --> 19:53.000
with an unrealistic impression

19:53.000 --> 19:56.240
of the benefits and harms of the drug.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.920
And yet, he's playing by the rules,

19:58.920 --> 20:01.360
he's doing his job as CEO

20:01.360 --> 20:04.600
to maximize the effect of his advertising

20:04.600 --> 20:07.680
and if he doesn't do it, this is a key point,

20:07.680 --> 20:11.960
if he doesn't do it, he'll get fired and the next guy will.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.640
So the people that survive in the company,

20:13.640 --> 20:16.720
the people that get raises in the company

20:16.720 --> 20:17.800
and move up in the company

20:17.800 --> 20:19.240
are the ones that play by the rules

20:19.240 --> 20:21.560
and that's how the game solidifies itself.

20:21.560 --> 20:24.400
But the game is within the balance of the law.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.320
Sometimes, most of the time, not always.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.280
We'll return to that question.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.720
I'm actually more concerned

20:31.720 --> 20:34.400
about the effect of advertisement

20:34.400 --> 20:39.400
in a kind of much larger scale

20:39.560 --> 20:43.080
on the people that are getting funded

20:43.080 --> 20:46.360
by the advertisement in self-censorship,

20:46.360 --> 20:50.960
just like more subtle, more passive pressure

20:50.960 --> 20:53.000
to not say anything negative.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
Because I've seen this and I've been saddened by it

20:58.480 --> 21:03.200
that people sacrifice integrity in small ways

21:03.200 --> 21:05.760
when they're being funded by a particular company.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.480
They don't see themselves as doing so,

21:09.480 --> 21:12.920
but you could just clearly see that the space of opinions

21:12.920 --> 21:15.240
that they're willing to engage in

21:15.240 --> 21:17.680
or space of ideas they're willing to play with

21:18.520 --> 21:22.960
is one that doesn't include anything

21:22.960 --> 21:25.600
that could possibly be negative about the company.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.840
They just choose not to because why?

21:28.840 --> 21:33.680
And that's really sad to me that if you give me 100 bucks,

21:33.680 --> 21:36.400
I'm less likely to say something negative about you.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.240
That makes me sad because the reason

21:41.240 --> 21:43.080
I wouldn't say something negative about you,

21:43.080 --> 21:45.640
I prefer is the pressure of friendship

21:45.640 --> 21:48.400
and human connection, those kinds of things.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.720
So I understand that.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.200
That's also a problem, by the way,

21:52.200 --> 21:54.360
so to start having dinners and shaking hands

21:54.360 --> 21:56.280
and, oh, aren't we friends?

21:56.280 --> 21:58.560
But the fact that money has that effect

21:58.560 --> 22:00.280
is really sad to me.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.160
On the news media, on the journalists, on scientists,

22:05.360 --> 22:06.960
that's scary to me.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.240
But of course, the direct advertisement to consumers,

22:09.240 --> 22:11.360
like you said, is potentially a very negative effect.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.520
I wanted to ask if what you think

22:14.520 --> 22:17.160
is the most negative impact of advertisement.

22:17.160 --> 22:20.360
Is it that direct to consumer on television?

22:20.360 --> 22:22.320
Is it advertisement to doctors,

22:22.320 --> 22:26.360
which I'm surprised to learn I was vaguely looking at

22:26.360 --> 22:28.680
is more than the advertisement,

22:28.680 --> 22:31.520
the more is spent on advertising to doctors

22:31.520 --> 22:32.720
than to consumers.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.080
That's really confusing to me.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.600
It's fascinating, actually.

22:35.600 --> 22:39.000
And then also, obviously, the law side of things

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
is the lobbying dollars,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.720
which I think is less than all of those.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.720
But anyway, it's in the ballpark.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.600
What concerns you most?

22:46.600 --> 22:49.800
Well, it's the whole nexus of influence.

22:49.800 --> 22:54.000
There's not one thing, and they don't invest all their,

22:54.000 --> 22:55.600
they don't put all their eggs in one basket.

22:55.600 --> 23:00.600
It's a whole surround sound program here.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.520
But in terms of advertisements,

23:04.520 --> 23:06.120
let's take the advertisement.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.680
Trulicity is a diabetes drug,

23:09.680 --> 23:12.600
for type 2 diabetes, an injectable drug.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.720
And it lowers blood sugar just about as well

23:15.720 --> 23:18.560
as metformin does.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.080
Metformin costs about $4 a month.

23:22.120 --> 23:25.800
Trulicity costs, I think, $6,200 a year.

23:25.800 --> 23:29.520
So $48 a year versus $6,200.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.640
Trulicity has distinguished itself

23:31.640 --> 23:35.120
because the manufacturer did a study

23:35.120 --> 23:37.360
that showed that it significantly reduces

23:37.360 --> 23:41.120
the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetics.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.400
And they got approval on the basis of that study,

23:44.400 --> 23:47.600
that very large study, being statistically significant.

23:49.040 --> 23:53.360
So the ads, obviously, extol the virtues of trolicity

23:53.360 --> 23:56.840
because it reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.360
And that's one of the major morbidities,

23:59.360 --> 24:01.600
risks of type 2 diabetes.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.840
What the ad doesn't say

24:02.920 --> 24:05.920
is that you have to treat 323 people

24:05.920 --> 24:08.120
to prevent one non-fatal event

24:08.120 --> 24:10.240
at a cost of $2.7 million.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.800
And even more importantly than that,

24:13.800 --> 24:17.720
what the ad doesn't say is that the evidence shows

24:17.720 --> 24:22.040
that engaging in an active, healthy lifestyle program

24:22.040 --> 24:24.600
reduces the risk of heart disease and strokes

24:24.600 --> 24:27.480
far more than trolicity does.

24:28.640 --> 24:32.160
Now, to be fair to the company, the sponsor,

24:32.160 --> 24:37.160
there's never been a study that compared trolicity

24:37.440 --> 24:39.760
to lifestyle changes.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.680
But that's part of the problem of our advertising.

24:42.680 --> 24:45.360
You would think in a rational society

24:45.360 --> 24:50.320
that was way out on a limb as a lone country,

24:50.320 --> 24:51.600
besides New Zealand,

24:51.600 --> 24:54.360
that allows direct-to-consumer advertising,

24:54.360 --> 24:59.120
that part of allowing direct-to-consumer advertising

24:59.160 --> 25:03.080
would be to mandate that the companies establish

25:03.080 --> 25:05.520
whether their drug is better than,

25:05.520 --> 25:07.960
say, healthy lifestyle adoption

25:07.960 --> 25:11.840
to prevent the problems that they claim to be preventing.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.800
But we don't require that.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.560
So the companies can afford to do very large studies

25:17.560 --> 25:19.560
so that very small differences

25:19.560 --> 25:21.880
become statistically significant.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.880
And their studies are asking the question,

25:23.880 --> 25:25.680
how can we sell more drug?

25:25.680 --> 25:27.320
They're not asking the question,

25:27.320 --> 25:30.600
how can we prevent cardiovascular disease

25:30.600 --> 25:32.720
in people with type 2 diabetes?

25:32.720 --> 25:34.240
And that's how we get off in this,

25:34.240 --> 25:38.560
we're now in the extreme arm of this distortion

25:38.560 --> 25:43.040
of our medical knowledge of studying how to sell more drugs

25:43.040 --> 25:45.480
than how to make people more healthy.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.920
That's a really great thing to compare it to,

25:48.920 --> 25:51.400
is lifestyle changes.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.240
Because that should be the bar.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.680
If you do some basic diet, exercise,

25:56.680 --> 25:58.440
all those kinds of things,

25:58.440 --> 26:00.240
how does this drug compare to that?

26:00.240 --> 26:01.400
Right, right.

26:01.400 --> 26:04.080
And that study was done, actually, in the 90s.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.080
It's called the Diabetes Prevention Program.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.160
It was federally funded by the NIH

26:09.160 --> 26:13.240
so that there wasn't this drug company imperative

26:13.240 --> 26:16.800
to just try to prove your drug was better than nothing.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.680
And it was a very well-designed study,

26:19.680 --> 26:22.440
randomized controlled trial

26:22.440 --> 26:25.000
in people who were at high risk of diabetes,

26:25.000 --> 26:26.840
so-called pre-diabetics.

26:26.840 --> 26:30.040
And they were randomized to three different groups,

26:30.040 --> 26:33.800
a placebo group, a group that got treated with metformin,

26:34.760 --> 26:36.200
and a group that got treated

26:36.200 --> 26:38.840
with intensive lifestyle counseling.

26:38.840 --> 26:43.600
So this study really tested whether you can get people

26:43.600 --> 26:46.000
in a randomized controlled trial

26:46.000 --> 26:49.280
assigned to intensive lifestyle changes,

26:49.280 --> 26:50.680
whether that works.

26:50.680 --> 26:54.640
Now, the common wisdom amongst physicians,

26:54.640 --> 26:56.080
and I think in general,

26:56.080 --> 26:58.200
is that you can't get people to change.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.240
You can do whatever you want.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.320
You can stand on your head.

27:00.320 --> 27:01.600
You can beg and plead.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.640
People won't change.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.080
So give it up, and let's just move on with the drugs

27:05.080 --> 27:06.440
and not waste any time.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.280
Except this study that was published

27:08.280 --> 27:11.040
in the New England Journal, I think in 2002,

27:11.040 --> 27:12.840
shows that's wrong,

27:12.840 --> 27:16.160
that the people who were in the intensive lifestyle group

27:16.160 --> 27:18.040
ended up losing 10 pounds,

27:18.040 --> 27:21.240
exercising five times a week maintaining it,

27:21.240 --> 27:26.240
and reduced the risk of getting diabetes by 58%

27:26.280 --> 27:27.920
compared to the metformin group,

27:27.920 --> 27:31.960
which reduced its risk of getting diabetes by 31%.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.880
So that exact study was done,

27:34.880 --> 27:37.920
and it showed that lifestyle intervention is the winner.

27:39.440 --> 27:44.440
Who, as a small tangent, is the leader?

27:44.880 --> 27:49.160
Who is supposed to fight for the side of lifestyle changes?

27:49.160 --> 27:54.160
Where's the big pharma version of lifestyle changes?

27:54.640 --> 27:57.240
Who's supposed to have the big bully pulpit,

27:57.240 --> 28:01.760
the big money behind lifestyle changes, in your sense?

28:01.760 --> 28:03.400
Because that seems to be missing

28:03.400 --> 28:06.280
in a lot of our discussions about health policy.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.080
Right, that's exactly right.

28:08.080 --> 28:12.800
And the answer is that we assume

28:12.800 --> 28:15.920
that the market has to solve all of these problems,

28:15.920 --> 28:18.320
and the market can't solve all of these problems.

28:18.320 --> 28:23.280
There needs to be some way of protecting the public interest

28:23.280 --> 28:26.520
for things that aren't financially driven,

28:26.520 --> 28:28.760
so that the overriding question has to be

28:28.760 --> 28:31.440
how best to improve Americans' health,

28:31.440 --> 28:36.200
not companies funding studies to try and prove

28:36.200 --> 28:39.280
that their new and expensive drug is better

28:39.280 --> 28:40.880
and should be used.

28:40.880 --> 28:45.480
Well, some of that is also people sort of like yourself.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.840
I mean, it's funny, you spoke with Joe Rogan.

28:48.840 --> 28:51.000
He constantly espouses lifestyle changes.

28:51.000 --> 28:56.000
So some of it is almost like understanding the problems

28:56.000 --> 28:58.200
that big pharma is creating in society,

28:58.200 --> 29:02.520
and then sort of these influential voices

29:02.520 --> 29:03.600
speaking up against it.

29:03.600 --> 29:08.600
So whether they're scientists or just regular communicators.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.360
Yeah, I think you gotta tip your hat to Joe

29:11.360 --> 29:13.160
for getting that message out.

29:13.160 --> 29:17.360
And he clearly believes it and does his best.

29:17.360 --> 29:21.040
But it's not coming out in the legitimate avenues,

29:21.040 --> 29:26.040
in the legitimate channels that are evidence-based medicine

29:26.040 --> 29:31.040
and from the sources that the docs are trained to listen to

29:32.040 --> 29:34.320
and modify their patient care on.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.480
Now, it's not 100%.

29:36.480 --> 29:40.160
I mean, there are articles in the big journals

29:40.160 --> 29:42.160
about the benefits of lifestyle,

29:42.160 --> 29:45.800
but they don't carry the same gravitas

29:45.800 --> 29:48.240
as the randomized controlled trials

29:48.240 --> 29:50.320
that test this drug against placebo

29:50.320 --> 29:52.360
or this drug against another drug.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.680
So the Joe Rogans of the world keep going.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.040
I tip my hat.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.920
But it's not gonna carry the day for most of the people

30:00.920 --> 30:04.240
until it has the legitimacy of the medical establishment.

30:04.240 --> 30:05.960
Yeah, like something that the doctors

30:05.960 --> 30:07.160
really pay attention to.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.720
Well, there's an entire mechanism established

30:09.720 --> 30:11.320
for testing drugs.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.400
There's not an entire mechanism established

30:14.400 --> 30:17.600
in terms of scientific rigor of testing lifestyle changes.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.520
I mean, it's more difficult.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.000
I mean, everything's difficult in science,

30:23.000 --> 30:27.080
with science that involves humans especially.

30:27.080 --> 30:30.600
But these studies are very expensive.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.960
They're difficult.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.520
It's difficult to find conclusions

30:33.520 --> 30:35.480
to control all the variables.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.360
And so it's very easy to dismiss them

30:37.360 --> 30:40.960
unless you really do a huge study that's very well-funded.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.840
And so maybe the doctors just lean

30:42.840 --> 30:45.720
towards the simpler studies over and over,

30:45.720 --> 30:48.040
which is what the drug companies fund.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.400
They can control more variables.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.640
See, but the control there is sometimes

30:56.960 --> 31:00.920
by hiding things too, right?

31:00.920 --> 31:03.480
So sometimes you can just say

31:03.480 --> 31:06.440
that this is a well-controlled study

31:06.440 --> 31:09.240
by pretending there's a bunch of other stuff,

31:09.280 --> 31:13.280
just ignoring the stuff that could be correlated,

31:13.280 --> 31:15.560
it could be the real cause of the effects you're seeing,

31:15.560 --> 31:17.360
all that kind of stuff.

31:17.360 --> 31:21.720
So money can buy ignorance, I suppose, in science.

31:21.720 --> 31:24.720
It buys kind of blinders that are on,

31:24.720 --> 31:28.040
that don't look outside the reductionist model.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.480
And that's another issue is that we kind of,

31:31.480 --> 31:34.320
nobody says to doctors in training,

31:34.360 --> 31:39.360
only listen to reductionist studies and conclusions

31:39.400 --> 31:42.120
and methods of promoting health.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.000
Nobody says that explicitly,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.680
but the respectable science

31:47.680 --> 31:49.800
has to do with controlling the factors.

31:49.800 --> 31:54.240
And I mean, it just doesn't make sense to me.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.480
I'm gonna pick on trulicity

31:55.480 --> 31:57.280
because it's such an obvious example,

31:57.280 --> 32:01.360
but it's not more egregious than many others.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.680
It doesn't make sense to me

32:02.680 --> 32:04.600
to allow a drug to be advertised

32:04.600 --> 32:07.000
as preventing cardiovascular disease

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
when you haven't included lifestyle changes

32:10.000 --> 32:11.400
as an arm in the study.

32:12.960 --> 32:14.680
It's just so crystal clear

32:14.680 --> 32:17.480
that the purpose of that study is to sell trulicity.

32:17.480 --> 32:20.480
It's not to prevent cardiovascular disease.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.800
If we were in charge, I would try to convince you

32:24.800 --> 32:26.040
that anywhere that study,

32:26.040 --> 32:31.040
the results of that study were presented to physicians,

32:31.080 --> 32:33.600
it would be stamped in big red letters,

32:33.600 --> 32:37.720
this study did not compare trulicity to lifestyle changes.

32:37.720 --> 32:38.960
They need to know that.

32:38.960 --> 32:40.680
And the docs are kind of trained,

32:40.680 --> 32:42.680
these blinders get put on,

32:42.680 --> 32:44.600
and they're trained to kind of forget

32:44.600 --> 32:46.320
that that's not there.

32:46.320 --> 32:48.240
Do you think, so first of all,

32:48.240 --> 32:51.320
that's a small or big change to advertisement

32:51.320 --> 32:53.120
that seems obvious to say,

32:54.080 --> 32:56.520
like in force that it should be compared

32:56.520 --> 32:57.680
to lifestyle changes.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.240
Do you think advertisements, period,

33:01.240 --> 33:05.920
in the United States for pharmaceutical drugs should be banned?

33:05.920 --> 33:07.520
I think they can't be banned,

33:07.520 --> 33:09.240
so it doesn't matter what I think.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.200
Okay, let's say you were a dictator,

33:13.200 --> 33:15.200
and two, why can't they be banned?

33:15.200 --> 33:16.320
Okay.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.600
Answer either one.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.800
I believe, I've been told by lawyers who I trust

33:22.800 --> 33:27.280
that the freedom of speech in the US Constitution

33:27.280 --> 33:29.360
is such that you can't ban them,

33:29.360 --> 33:33.320
that you could ban cigarettes and alcohol,

33:33.320 --> 33:35.640
which have no therapeutic use,

33:35.640 --> 33:37.680
but drugs have a therapeutic use,

33:37.680 --> 33:41.600
and advertisements about them can't be banned.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.680
Let's assume that they can't be,

33:43.680 --> 33:45.840
because we know they won't be anyway.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.120
But let's assume they can't be,

33:49.120 --> 33:51.800
and especially our Supreme Court now

33:51.800 --> 33:55.880
would be unlikely to take that seriously.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.360
But that's not the issue.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.240
The issue is that if the drug companies

34:00.240 --> 34:02.640
wanna spend their money advertising,

34:02.640 --> 34:06.880
they should have to have independent analysis

34:06.880 --> 34:10.480
of the message that the viewers are left with

34:10.480 --> 34:13.400
about the drug, so that it's realistic.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.520
What's the chance the drug will help them?

34:15.520 --> 34:19.000
Well, in truth, the city, it's one out of 323.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.120
322 people aren't gonna benefit

34:21.120 --> 34:23.680
from the cardiovascular risk reduction.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.920
What's the true cost?

34:26.920 --> 34:30.200
When drugs advertise that you may be able

34:30.200 --> 34:33.160
to get this for a $25 copay or something,

34:33.160 --> 34:36.000
a tens of thousands of dollars a year drug

34:36.000 --> 34:40.160
for a $25 copay, what an enormous disservice that is

34:40.160 --> 34:42.640
to misrepresent the cost to society.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.080
That should not be allowed.

34:44.080 --> 34:48.720
So you should have to make it clear to the viewers

34:48.720 --> 34:50.000
how many people are gonna benefit,

34:50.000 --> 34:51.720
what's your chance of benefiting,

34:51.720 --> 34:53.600
how does it compare to lifestyle changes,

34:54.480 --> 34:55.880
or less expensive therapies?

34:55.880 --> 34:58.480
What do you give up if you use a less expensive therapy

34:58.480 --> 35:00.000
or gain, perhaps?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.200
And how much it costs?

35:01.200 --> 35:02.320
How much it costs.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.600
Now, that can go either way,

35:03.600 --> 35:06.800
because if you say Humira costs $72,000

35:06.800 --> 35:09.000
and it's no more effective as a first-line drug

35:09.000 --> 35:12.320
than methotrexate, which costs $480,

35:12.320 --> 35:15.080
people might say, I want the expensive drug

35:15.080 --> 35:17.760
because I can get it for a $25 copay.

35:17.760 --> 35:21.680
So you'd have to temper that a little bit.

35:21.680 --> 35:25.600
Oh, you mean people are so, they don't care.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.440
They don't care.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.680
Their insurance is gonna cover it

35:27.680 --> 35:29.480
and it's a $25 copay,

35:29.480 --> 35:31.880
but we could figure out how to deal with that.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.280
The main point is that if we assume

35:35.280 --> 35:38.800
that advertisements are gonna keep going, and they are,

35:38.800 --> 35:43.800
we could require that there be outside evaluation

35:45.520 --> 35:48.920
of the message that reasonable unbiased viewers

35:48.920 --> 35:51.040
take away from the ads.

35:51.040 --> 35:54.240
And the ads would have to tell the truth about the drug.

35:55.760 --> 36:00.760
And the truth should have like sub-truth guardrails,

36:01.140 --> 36:03.720
meaning like the cost that we talked about,

36:03.720 --> 36:07.080
the effects compared to things that actually,

36:07.080 --> 36:11.840
lifestyle changes, just these details,

36:11.840 --> 36:16.560
very strict guardrails of what actually has to be specified.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.400
And I would make it against the law

36:19.400 --> 36:22.080
to have family picnics or dogs catching frisbees

36:22.080 --> 36:23.400
in the ads.

36:23.400 --> 36:28.400
So, you mean 95% of the ads, yes.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.680
I mean, there's something dark and inauthentic

36:32.680 --> 36:34.560
about those advertisements, but they seem,

36:34.560 --> 36:36.280
I mean, I'm sure they're being done

36:36.280 --> 36:38.720
because they work for the target audience.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.160
And then the doctors too.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.720
Can you really buy a doctor's opinion?

36:48.720 --> 36:51.320
Why does it have such an effect on doctors?

36:52.280 --> 36:55.440
Advertisement to doctors, like you as a physician,

36:55.440 --> 36:58.440
again, like from everything I've seen, people love you.

36:58.440 --> 37:03.440
And I've just, people should definitely look you off from,

37:04.880 --> 37:09.280
there's a bunch of videos of you giving talks on YouTube,

37:09.280 --> 37:14.280
and it's just, it's so refreshing to hear

37:14.720 --> 37:17.480
just a clarity of thought about health policy,

37:17.480 --> 37:19.680
about healthcare, just the way you think

37:19.680 --> 37:20.720
throughout the years.

37:20.720 --> 37:21.560
Thank you.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.720
So like, it's easy to think about like,

37:23.720 --> 37:25.400
maybe you're criticizing Big Pharma,

37:25.400 --> 37:28.840
that's one part of the message that you're talking about,

37:28.840 --> 37:31.480
but you know, that's not like,

37:31.480 --> 37:34.040
your brilliance actually shines in the positive,

37:34.040 --> 37:35.480
in the solutions and how to do it.

37:35.480 --> 37:40.480
So, as a doctor, what affects your mind?

37:40.960 --> 37:43.160
And how does Big Pharma affect your mind?

37:43.160 --> 37:45.600
Number one, the information

37:45.600 --> 37:48.280
that comes through legitimate sources

37:48.280 --> 37:51.120
that doctors have been taught to rely on,

37:51.120 --> 37:52.600
evidence-based medicine,

37:52.600 --> 37:55.440
the articles in peer-reviewed journals,

37:55.440 --> 37:57.040
the guidelines that are issued.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.280
Now, those are problematic,

37:59.280 --> 38:03.280
because when an article is peer-reviewed

38:03.280 --> 38:05.120
and published in a respected journal,

38:06.380 --> 38:10.400
people and doctors obviously assume

38:10.400 --> 38:15.400
that the peer reviewers have had access to the data

38:15.840 --> 38:18.440
and they've independently analyzed the data

38:18.440 --> 38:21.960
and they corroborate the findings in the manuscript

38:21.960 --> 38:25.800
that was submitted or they give feedback to the authors

38:25.800 --> 38:28.280
and say, we disagree with you on this point

38:28.280 --> 38:30.800
and would you please check our analysis

38:30.800 --> 38:32.520
and if you agree with us, make it.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.640
That's what they assume the peer review process is,

38:35.640 --> 38:36.960
but it's not.

38:36.960 --> 38:39.280
The peer reviewers don't have the data.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.880
The peer reviewers have the manuscript

38:41.880 --> 38:46.320
that's been submitted usually in conjunction with

38:46.320 --> 38:51.320
or by the drug company that manufactures the drug.

38:51.600 --> 38:56.600
So, peer reviewers are unable to perform the job

38:57.400 --> 38:59.760
that doctors think they're performing

38:59.760 --> 39:03.320
to vet the data to assure that it's accurate

39:03.320 --> 39:05.160
and reasonably complete.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.380
They can't do it.

39:07.340 --> 39:09.500
And then we have the clinical practice guidelines,

39:09.500 --> 39:14.500
which are increasingly more important as the information,

39:14.540 --> 39:18.700
the flow of information keeps getting brisker and brisker

39:18.700 --> 39:22.020
and docs need to get to the bottom line quickly.

39:22.020 --> 39:25.700
Clinical practice guidelines become much more important

39:25.700 --> 39:28.780
and we assume that the authors

39:28.780 --> 39:30.380
of those clinical practice guidelines

39:30.380 --> 39:32.380
have independently analyzed the data

39:32.380 --> 39:35.900
from the clinical trials and make their recommendations

39:35.900 --> 39:39.140
that set the standards of care based on their analysis.

39:39.140 --> 39:40.860
That's not what happens.

39:40.860 --> 39:44.180
The experts who write the clinical trials

39:44.180 --> 39:49.180
rely almost entirely on the publications

39:49.460 --> 39:51.940
presenting the results of the clinical trials,

39:51.940 --> 39:53.000
which are peer reviewed,

39:53.000 --> 39:56.340
but the peer reviewers haven't had access to the data.

39:56.340 --> 40:01.140
So, we've got a system of the highest level of evidence

40:01.140 --> 40:03.800
that doctors have been trained over and over again

40:03.800 --> 40:06.400
to rely on to practice evidence-based medicine

40:06.400 --> 40:10.840
to be good doctors that has not been verified.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.280
Do you think that data

40:13.600 --> 40:17.080
that's coming from the pharma companies,

40:17.080 --> 40:20.840
do you think what level of manipulation

40:20.840 --> 40:22.520
is going on with that data?

40:22.520 --> 40:25.920
Is it at the study design level?

40:25.920 --> 40:28.120
Is it at literally there's some data

40:28.120 --> 40:33.120
that you just keep off, keep out of the charts?

40:33.880 --> 40:36.920
Keep out of the aggregate analysis

40:36.920 --> 40:38.600
that you then publish?

40:38.600 --> 40:41.400
Or is it the worst case,

40:41.400 --> 40:44.680
which is just change some of the numbers?

40:44.680 --> 40:46.200
It happened, all three happened.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.580
I can't, I don't know what the denominator is,

40:48.580 --> 40:51.700
but I spent about 10 years in litigation.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.920
And for example, in Vioxx,

40:54.920 --> 40:57.400
which was withdrawn from the market in 2004

40:57.400 --> 41:01.260
in the biggest drug recall in American history,

41:02.260 --> 41:06.060
the problem was that it got recalled

41:06.060 --> 41:08.580
when a study that Merck sponsored

41:08.580 --> 41:10.580
showed that Vioxx doubled the risk,

41:10.580 --> 41:12.740
more than doubled the risk of heart attacks,

41:12.740 --> 41:16.740
strokes, and blood clots, serious blood clots.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.100
It got pulled then.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.620
But there was a study, a bigger study

41:20.620 --> 41:22.740
that had been published in 2000

41:22.740 --> 41:24.660
in the New England Journal of Medicine

41:24.660 --> 41:28.580
that showed that Vioxx was a better drug

41:28.580 --> 41:32.860
for arthritis and pain,

41:32.860 --> 41:34.260
not because it was more effective,

41:34.260 --> 41:36.460
it's no more effective than Aleve or Advil,

41:37.460 --> 41:40.220
but because it was less likely

41:40.220 --> 41:43.220
to cause serious GI complications,

41:43.220 --> 41:45.120
bleeds and perforations in the gut.

41:46.180 --> 41:48.140
Now, in that study that was published

41:48.140 --> 41:51.620
in the New England Journal that was never corrected,

41:51.620 --> 41:55.980
it was a little bit modified 15 months

41:55.980 --> 41:57.540
after the drug was taken off the market,

41:57.540 --> 42:01.560
but never corrected, Merck left out three heart attacks.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.620
And the FDA knew that Merck left out three heart attacks.

42:05.620 --> 42:10.420
And the FDA's analysis of the data from that study

42:10.420 --> 42:14.700
said that the FDA wasn't gonna do the analysis

42:14.700 --> 42:16.940
without the three heart attacks in it.

42:16.940 --> 42:19.660
And the important part of this story

42:19.660 --> 42:23.100
is that there were 12 authors listed on that study

42:23.100 --> 42:24.340
in the New England Journal.

42:24.340 --> 42:26.280
Two were Merck employees.

42:26.280 --> 42:27.800
They knew about the three heart attacks

42:27.800 --> 42:29.640
that had been omitted.

42:29.640 --> 42:34.480
The other 10 authors, the academic authors,

42:34.480 --> 42:37.120
didn't know about it, they hadn't seen that data.

42:38.040 --> 42:41.980
So Merck just, they had an excuse,

42:41.980 --> 42:44.280
it's complicated and the FDA didn't accept it,

42:44.280 --> 42:46.840
so there's no reason to go into it.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.840
But Merck just left out the three heart attacks.

42:48.840 --> 42:50.040
And the three heart attacks,

42:50.040 --> 42:51.340
it may seem three heart attacks

42:51.340 --> 42:54.200
in a 10,000 person study may seem like nothing,

42:54.200 --> 42:57.540
except they completely changed the statistics

42:57.540 --> 43:00.020
so that had the three heart attacks been included,

43:00.020 --> 43:02.600
the only conclusion that Merck could have made

43:02.600 --> 43:04.680
was that Vioxx significantly increased

43:04.680 --> 43:06.360
the risk of heart attack.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.600
And they abbreviated their endpoint

43:09.600 --> 43:12.380
from heart attack strokes and blood clots

43:12.380 --> 43:13.800
to just heart attacks.

43:13.800 --> 43:17.120
Yeah, so those are maybe in their mind,

43:17.120 --> 43:18.300
they're also playing by the rules

43:18.300 --> 43:20.400
because of some technical excuse that you mentioned

43:20.400 --> 43:22.200
that was rejected.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.040
How can this, because this is crossing the line.

43:24.040 --> 43:25.080
Let me interrupt.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.500
No, that's not true.

43:28.040 --> 43:32.040
The study was completed, the blind was broken,

43:32.040 --> 43:34.400
meaning they looked at the data.

43:34.400 --> 43:37.360
In March of 2000, the article was published

43:37.360 --> 43:40.080
in the New England Journal in November of 2000.

43:40.080 --> 43:45.080
In March of 2000, there was an email by the head scientist

43:45.920 --> 43:48.200
that was published in the Wall Street Journal

43:49.640 --> 43:53.800
that said the day that the data were unblinded,

43:54.440 --> 43:57.680
that it's a shame that the cardiovascular events are there,

43:58.640 --> 44:03.640
but the drug will do well and we will do well.

44:08.680 --> 44:12.360
But removing the three heart attacks, how does that happen?

44:12.360 --> 44:16.840
Like who has to convince themselves?

44:16.840 --> 44:18.560
Is this pure malevolence?

44:19.520 --> 44:21.440
You have to be the judge of that,

44:21.440 --> 44:23.640
but the person who was in charge

44:23.640 --> 44:25.760
of the data safety monitoring board

44:27.040 --> 44:29.600
issued a letter that said they'll stop

44:29.600 --> 44:32.400
counting cardiovascular events

44:32.400 --> 44:35.120
a month before the trial is over

44:35.120 --> 44:38.440
and they'll continue counting GI events.

44:38.440 --> 44:43.360
And that person got a contract to consult with Merck

44:43.360 --> 44:47.580
for $5,000 a day, I think for 12 days a year

44:47.580 --> 44:50.660
for one or two years that was signed,

44:50.660 --> 44:55.660
that contract was signed within two weeks

44:56.500 --> 45:00.460
of the decision to stop counting heart attacks.

45:00.460 --> 45:03.140
I wanna understand that man or woman.

45:04.460 --> 45:08.060
I wanna, it's the, I've been reading a lot

45:08.060 --> 45:10.940
about Nazi Germany and thinking a lot

45:10.940 --> 45:15.940
about the good Germans because I want to understand

45:16.620 --> 45:20.020
so that we can each encourage each other

45:20.020 --> 45:23.820
to take the small heroic actions that prevents that.

45:23.820 --> 45:27.140
Because it feels to me, removing malevolence

45:27.140 --> 45:31.260
from the table where it's just a pure psychopathic person,

45:31.260 --> 45:34.860
that there's just a momentum created by the game,

45:34.860 --> 45:35.700
like you mentioned.

45:35.700 --> 45:36.660
Yes.

45:36.660 --> 45:41.660
And so it takes reversing the momentum within a company,

45:42.660 --> 45:46.860
I think requires many small acts of heroism.

45:46.860 --> 45:50.620
Not gigantic, I'm going to leave and become a whistleblower

45:50.620 --> 45:52.460
and publish a book about it.

45:52.460 --> 45:57.060
But small, quiet acts of pressuring against this.

45:57.060 --> 45:59.220
Like, what are we doing here?

45:59.220 --> 46:00.460
We're trying to help people.

46:00.460 --> 46:01.700
Is this the right thing to do?

46:01.700 --> 46:03.380
Looking in the mirror constantly asking,

46:03.380 --> 46:05.240
is this the right thing to do?

46:05.240 --> 46:07.620
I mean, that's how, that's what integrity is.

46:08.500 --> 46:11.220
Acknowledging the pressures you're under

46:11.300 --> 46:13.660
and then still be able to zoom out and think,

46:13.660 --> 46:15.360
what is the right thing to do here?

46:16.660 --> 46:21.220
But the data, hiding the data makes it too easy

46:21.220 --> 46:22.700
to live in ignorance.

46:22.700 --> 46:25.460
So like within those, inside those companies.

46:29.560 --> 46:34.560
So your idea is that the reviewers should see the data.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.420
That's one step.

46:36.420 --> 46:39.780
So to even push back on that idea is,

46:40.700 --> 46:43.380
I assume you mean that data remains private

46:43.380 --> 46:47.060
except to the peer reviewers.

46:47.060 --> 46:49.660
The problem, of course, as you probably know,

46:49.660 --> 46:52.020
is the peer review process is not perfect.

46:53.100 --> 46:55.500
You know, it's individuals.

46:55.500 --> 46:58.780
It feels like there should be a lot more eyes on the data

46:58.780 --> 47:00.480
than just the peer reviewers.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.540
Yes, this is not a hard problem to solve.

47:03.540 --> 47:06.700
When a study is completed,

47:06.700 --> 47:09.060
a clinical study report is made.

47:10.220 --> 47:12.300
And it's usually several thousand pages.

47:12.300 --> 47:15.900
And what it does is it takes the raw patient data

47:15.900 --> 47:19.700
and it tabulates it in the ways,

47:19.700 --> 47:22.060
it's supposedly and usually,

47:22.060 --> 47:25.620
in the ways that the company has pre-specified.

47:25.620 --> 47:28.420
So that you then end up with a searchable,

47:28.420 --> 47:30.720
let's say 3000 page document.

47:32.040 --> 47:36.180
As I became more experienced as an expert in litigation,

47:36.180 --> 47:39.700
I could go through those documents pretty quickly,

47:40.620 --> 47:42.060
it quickly may mean 20 hours or 40 hours,

47:42.060 --> 47:44.340
but it doesn't mean three months of my work.

47:45.300 --> 47:49.120
And see if the companies,

47:49.120 --> 47:51.660
if the way the company has analyzed the data

47:51.660 --> 47:55.820
is consistent with their statistical analysis plan

47:55.820 --> 48:00.060
and their pre-specified outcome measures.

48:00.060 --> 48:01.300
It's not hard.

48:01.300 --> 48:02.780
And I think you're right.

48:02.780 --> 48:06.200
Peer reviewers, I don't peer review clinical trials,

48:06.200 --> 48:09.300
but I peer review other kinds of articles.

48:09.900 --> 48:11.540
I have to do one on the airplane on the way home.

48:11.540 --> 48:12.500
And it's hard, I mean,

48:12.500 --> 48:15.540
we're just ordinary mortal people volunteering to-

48:15.540 --> 48:19.180
Unpaid, the motivation is not clear.

48:19.180 --> 48:22.080
The motivation is to keep,

48:23.500 --> 48:27.920
to be a good citizen in the medical community

48:27.920 --> 48:31.140
and to be on friendly terms with the journals.

48:31.140 --> 48:33.260
So that if you wanna get published,

48:33.260 --> 48:37.300
there's sort of an unspoken incentive.

48:37.300 --> 48:39.820
As somebody who enjoys game theory,

48:39.820 --> 48:42.220
I feel like that motivation is good,

48:42.220 --> 48:43.720
but it could be a lot better.

48:44.580 --> 48:46.540
Yes, you should get more recognition

48:46.540 --> 48:50.260
or in some way academic credit for it.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.980
It should go to your career advancement.

48:52.980 --> 48:54.380
If it's an important paper

48:54.380 --> 48:56.620
and you recognize it's an important paper

48:56.620 --> 48:58.420
as a great peer reviewer,

48:58.420 --> 49:01.780
that this is not in that area where it's

49:04.220 --> 49:05.920
clearly a piece of crap paper

49:05.920 --> 49:08.300
or clearly an awesome paper

49:08.300 --> 49:10.840
that doesn't have controversial aspects to it

49:10.840 --> 49:13.120
and it's just a beautiful piece of work,

49:13.120 --> 49:14.640
okay, those are easy.

49:14.640 --> 49:17.740
And then there is like the very difficult gray area,

49:17.740 --> 49:20.240
which may require many, many days of work

49:20.240 --> 49:21.900
on your part as a peer reviewer.

49:21.900 --> 49:24.400
So it's not just a couple hours,

49:24.400 --> 49:27.280
but really seriously reading.

49:27.280 --> 49:30.700
Like some papers can take months to really understand.

49:30.700 --> 49:33.600
So if you really wanna struggle,

49:33.640 --> 49:35.960
there has to be an incentive for that struggle.

49:35.960 --> 49:40.960
Yes, and billions of dollars ride on some of these studies.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.720
And lies, right, not to mention.

49:44.720 --> 49:49.720
Right, but it would be easy to have full-time statisticians

49:51.080 --> 49:53.880
hired by the journals or shared by the journals

49:55.320 --> 50:00.320
who were independent of any other financial incentive

50:00.320 --> 50:04.040
to go over these kind of methodological issues

50:04.040 --> 50:08.920
and take responsibility for certifying the analyses

50:08.920 --> 50:11.240
that are done and then pass it on

50:11.240 --> 50:14.120
to the volunteer peer reviewers.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.480
See, I believe even in this, in the sort of capitalism

50:17.480 --> 50:21.640
or even social capital, after watching Twitter

50:21.640 --> 50:24.920
in the time of COVID and just looking at people

50:24.920 --> 50:27.480
that investigate themselves,

50:27.480 --> 50:30.120
I believe in the citizenry.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.800
If you give them access to the data,

50:32.800 --> 50:35.920
these citizen scientists arise.

50:35.920 --> 50:38.400
A lot of them on the, it's kind of funny,

50:39.360 --> 50:41.000
a lot of people that are just really used

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
to working with data.

50:43.200 --> 50:44.640
They don't know anything about medicine

50:44.640 --> 50:46.840
and they don't have actually the biases

50:46.840 --> 50:48.920
that a lot of doctors and medical

50:48.920 --> 50:51.080
and a lot of the people that read these papers,

50:51.080 --> 50:53.280
they'll just go raw into the data

50:53.280 --> 50:56.160
and look at it with, like they're bored almost

50:56.160 --> 50:58.360
and they do incredible analysis.

50:58.360 --> 51:01.080
So I, you know, there's some argument to be made

51:01.080 --> 51:04.120
for a lot of this data to become public,

51:04.120 --> 51:07.160
like de-anonymized, no, sorry, anonymized,

51:08.400 --> 51:11.160
all that kind of stuff, but for a lot of it to be public,

51:11.160 --> 51:13.400
especially when you're talking about things

51:14.560 --> 51:17.000
as impactful as some of these drugs.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.160
I agree 100%.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.000
So let's turn the micro,

51:20.000 --> 51:22.200
let's get a little bit more granular.

51:22.200 --> 51:24.240
On the peer review issue,

51:24.240 --> 51:27.840
we're talking about pre-publication transparencies

51:27.840 --> 51:29.640
and that is critically important.

51:29.640 --> 51:33.640
Once a paper is published, the horses are out of the barn

51:33.640 --> 51:34.880
and docs are gonna read it,

51:34.880 --> 51:36.840
take it as evidence-based medicine.

51:36.840 --> 51:41.080
The economists call what then happens as stickiness

51:41.080 --> 51:43.400
that the docs hold on to their beliefs.

51:43.400 --> 51:47.360
And my own voice inside says,

51:47.360 --> 51:52.080
once doctors start doing things to their patients' bodies,

51:52.080 --> 51:53.720
they're really not too enthusiastic

51:53.720 --> 51:55.480
about hearing it was wrong.

51:55.480 --> 51:57.920
Yeah, that's the stickiness of human nature.

51:57.920 --> 52:02.920
Wow, so that bar, once it's published in the doctors,

52:03.320 --> 52:05.200
that's when the stickiness emerges, wow.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.280
Yeah, it's hard to put that toothpaste back in the tube.

52:08.280 --> 52:11.600
Now, that's pre-publication transparency,

52:11.600 --> 52:13.080
which is essential.

52:13.080 --> 52:14.600
And you could have,

52:14.600 --> 52:17.520
whoever saw that data pre-publication

52:17.520 --> 52:20.040
could sign confidentiality agreements

52:20.040 --> 52:22.560
so that the drug companies couldn't argue

52:22.560 --> 52:24.760
that we're just opening the spigots of our data

52:24.760 --> 52:28.880
and people can copy it and all the excuses they make.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.560
You could argue that you didn't have to,

52:30.560 --> 52:32.440
but let's just let them do it.

52:32.440 --> 52:35.200
Let the peer reviewers sign confidentiality agreements

52:35.200 --> 52:36.800
and they won't leak the data.

52:36.800 --> 52:39.880
But then you have to go to post-publication transparency,

52:39.880 --> 52:41.760
which is what you were just getting at,

52:41.760 --> 52:46.760
to let the data free and let citizens

52:47.040 --> 52:50.560
and citizen scientists and other doctors

52:50.560 --> 52:52.680
who are interested have at it.

52:53.680 --> 52:55.800
Kind of like Wiki, Wikipedia.

52:55.800 --> 52:58.400
Have at it and let it out

52:58.400 --> 53:00.160
and let people criticize each other.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.160
Okay, so speaking of the data,

53:03.160 --> 53:08.160
the FDA asked 55 years to release Pfizer vaccine data.

53:08.880 --> 53:12.200
This is also something I raised with Albert Berla.

53:12.200 --> 53:13.880
What did he say?

53:13.880 --> 53:16.840
There's several things I didn't like about what he said.

53:16.840 --> 53:18.360
So some things are expected

53:18.360 --> 53:21.120
and some of it is just revealing the human being,

53:21.120 --> 53:23.760
which is what I'm interested in doing.

53:23.760 --> 53:28.120
But he said he wasn't aware of the 75 and the 55.

53:28.120 --> 53:29.840
I'm sorry, wait a minute.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.120
He wasn't aware of?

53:31.120 --> 53:32.000
The how long.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.200
So here I'll explain what he.

53:34.200 --> 53:37.400
Do you know that since you spoke to him,

53:37.400 --> 53:42.120
Pfizer has petitioned the judge to join the suit

53:42.120 --> 53:45.040
in behalf of the FDA's request

53:45.040 --> 53:50.040
to release that data over 55 or 75 years.

53:50.080 --> 53:52.240
Pfizer's fully aware of what's going on.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.600
He's aware.

53:53.600 --> 53:56.320
I'm sure he's aware in some formulation,

53:56.320 --> 53:59.160
the exact years he might have not been aware.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.280
But the point is that there is,

54:02.600 --> 54:06.680
that is the FDA, the relationship of Pfizer and the FDA

54:06.680 --> 54:11.080
in terms of me being able to read human beings

54:11.080 --> 54:14.400
was the thing he was most uncomfortable with,

54:14.400 --> 54:17.560
that he didn't wanna talk about the FDA.

54:17.600 --> 54:22.360
And it was clear that there was a relationship there

54:22.360 --> 54:26.520
that if the words you use may do a lot of harm,

54:26.520 --> 54:28.600
potentially because like you're saying,

54:28.600 --> 54:31.440
there might be lawsuits going on, there's litigation,

54:31.440 --> 54:33.520
there's legal stuff, all that kind of stuff.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.680
And then there's a lot of games being played in this space.

54:36.680 --> 54:40.120
So I don't know how to interpret it

54:40.120 --> 54:41.640
if he's actually aware or not,

54:41.640 --> 54:46.640
but the deeper truth is that he's deeply uncomfortable

54:48.120 --> 54:53.120
with bringing light to this part of the game.

54:53.120 --> 54:56.040
Yes, and I'm gonna read between the lines

54:56.040 --> 55:00.000
and Albert Borla certainly didn't ask me to speak for him.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.520
But I think, when did you speak to him?

55:02.520 --> 55:03.480
How long ago?

55:03.480 --> 55:05.840
Wow, time flies when you're having fun.

55:05.840 --> 55:06.680
Two months ago.

55:06.680 --> 55:07.520
Two months ago.

55:07.520 --> 55:12.080
So that was just recently it's come out,

55:12.080 --> 55:14.520
just in the past week it's come out

55:14.520 --> 55:18.960
that Pfizer isn't battling the FDA.

55:18.960 --> 55:23.960
Pfizer has joined the FDA in the opposition to the request

55:24.920 --> 55:29.920
to release these documents in the same amount of time

55:30.960 --> 55:33.200
that the FDA took to evaluate them.

55:33.200 --> 55:34.080
Yeah.

55:34.080 --> 55:39.080
So Pfizer is offering to help the FDA

55:39.440 --> 55:44.440
to petition the judge to not enforce the timeline

55:48.360 --> 55:50.760
that he seems to be moving towards.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.320
So for people who are not familiar,

55:52.320 --> 55:55.800
we're talking about the Freedom of Information Act request

55:55.800 --> 56:00.800
to release the Pfizer vaccine data, study data,

56:01.800 --> 56:04.000
to release as much of the data as possible,

56:04.000 --> 56:07.000
like the raw data, the details, or some of the data

56:07.040 --> 56:08.920
with like the raw data, the details,

56:08.920 --> 56:12.480
or actually not even the raw data, it's data.

56:12.480 --> 56:14.600
Doesn't matter, there's details to it.

56:14.600 --> 56:19.480
And I think the response from the FDA is that,

56:19.480 --> 56:21.400
of course, yes, of course,

56:23.760 --> 56:28.760
but we can only publish like some X number of pages a day.

56:29.680 --> 56:31.000
500 pages.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.680
500 pages of data.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.960
It's not a day though.

56:33.960 --> 56:36.480
It's a week, I think.

56:36.480 --> 56:39.440
One is whatever they're able to publish is ridiculous.

56:39.440 --> 56:44.440
It's like, my printer can only print three pages a day

56:45.560 --> 56:48.040
and we cannot afford a second printer.

56:48.040 --> 56:52.320
So it's some kind of bureaucratic language for,

56:52.320 --> 56:54.000
there's a process to this.

56:55.240 --> 56:58.120
And now you're saying that Pfizer is obviously

56:59.360 --> 57:03.560
more engaged in helping this kind of bureaucratic process

57:03.560 --> 57:08.560
prosper in its full absurdity, Kafkaesque absurdity.

57:08.920 --> 57:11.920
So what is this?

57:11.920 --> 57:13.840
This really bothered people.

57:13.840 --> 57:14.680
This really-

57:14.680 --> 57:15.720
This is really troublesome.

57:15.720 --> 57:19.680
And just to put it in just plain English terms,

57:20.720 --> 57:23.560
Pfizer's making the case that it can't,

57:24.840 --> 57:27.440
the FDA and Pfizer together are making the case

57:27.440 --> 57:29.840
that they can't go through the documents

57:29.840 --> 57:33.680
that it's gonna take them some number of hundred fold,

57:33.680 --> 57:37.120
hundreds of folds more time to go through the documents

57:37.120 --> 57:39.800
than the FDA required to go through the documents

57:39.800 --> 57:42.280
to approve the vaccines,

57:42.280 --> 57:44.920
to give the vaccines full FDA approval.

57:44.920 --> 57:48.880
And the FDA's argument, talk about Kafkaesque,

57:48.880 --> 57:51.280
is that to do it more rapidly

57:51.280 --> 57:53.040
would cost them $3 million.

57:54.040 --> 57:59.040
$3 million equals one hour of vaccine sales over two years.

58:01.920 --> 58:04.280
One hour of sales.

58:04.280 --> 58:05.880
And they can't come up with the money.

58:05.880 --> 58:07.960
And now Pfizer has joined the suit

58:07.960 --> 58:10.200
to help the FDA fight off this judge,

58:10.200 --> 58:12.880
this mean judge who thinks they ought to release the data.

58:12.880 --> 58:15.320
But evidently Pfizer isn't offering to come up

58:15.320 --> 58:17.240
with the $3 million either.

58:17.240 --> 58:18.840
So bought for $3 million.

58:18.840 --> 58:23.840
I mean, maybe the FDA should do a GoFundMe campaign.

58:25.440 --> 58:28.360
Well, obviously the money thing,

58:28.360 --> 58:31.280
I mean, I'm sure if Elon Musk comes along and says,

58:31.280 --> 58:35.480
I'll give you a hundred million, publish it now,

58:35.480 --> 58:37.880
I think they'll come up with another.

58:37.880 --> 58:41.880
So, I mean, it's clear that there's cautiousness.

58:43.600 --> 58:47.120
I don't know the source of it from the FDA.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.720
There's only one explanation that I can think of,

58:50.600 --> 58:53.040
which is that the FDA and Pfizer

58:53.040 --> 58:55.440
don't wanna release the data.

58:55.440 --> 58:57.960
They don't wanna release the three

58:57.960 --> 59:02.100
or 500,000 pages of documents.

59:03.200 --> 59:05.440
And I don't know what's in there.

59:05.440 --> 59:08.180
I wanna say one thing very clearly.

59:08.180 --> 59:10.160
I am not an anti-vaxxer.

59:10.160 --> 59:11.960
I believe the vaccines work.

59:11.960 --> 59:15.240
I believe everybody should get vaccinated.

59:15.240 --> 59:17.640
The evidence is clear that if you're vaccinated,

59:17.640 --> 59:20.920
you reduce your risk of dying of COVID by 20 fold.

59:20.920 --> 59:23.480
And we've got new sub-variants coming along.

59:23.480 --> 59:26.640
And I just wanna be very clear about this.

59:26.640 --> 59:29.440
That said, there's something,

59:29.440 --> 59:32.920
I would give you 10 to one odds on a bet

59:32.920 --> 59:35.120
that there's something in that data

59:35.120 --> 59:37.800
that is gonna be embarrassing

59:37.800 --> 59:41.120
to either FDA or Pfizer or both.

59:41.120 --> 59:42.000
So there's two options.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.760
I agree with you a hundred percent.

59:43.800 --> 59:46.760
One is they know of embarrassing things.

59:46.760 --> 59:48.240
That's option one.

59:48.240 --> 59:51.800
And option two, they haven't invested enough

59:51.800 --> 59:54.240
to truly understand the data.

59:54.240 --> 59:56.480
Like, I mean, it's a lot of data

59:56.480 --> 59:58.200
that they have a sense

59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.080
there might be something embarrassing in there.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:02.160
And if we release it,

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:04.440
surely the world will discover the embarrassing.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.920
And to do sort of the steel man, their argument,

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.720
they'll take the small, the press,

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.480
the people will take the small embarrassing things

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.440
and blow them up into big things.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:20.320
Yes, and support the anti-vax campaign.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.720
I think that's all possible.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.840
Nonetheless, the data

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.920
are about the original clinical trial.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.200
And the emergency youths authorization

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.760
was based on the first few months

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.200
of the data from that trial.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.880
And it was a two year trial.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.240
The rest of that data has not been opened up.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:43.560
And there was not an advisory committee meeting

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.040
to look at that data

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.440
when the FDA granted full authorization.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.320
Again, I am pro-vaccine.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.640
I am not making an anti-vax argument here.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.280
But I suspect that there's something

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.480
pretty serious in that data.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.120
And the reason why I'm not an anti-vaxxer,

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.440
having not been able to see the data

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.120
that the FDA and Pfizer seem to willing

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.040
not just to put effort into preventing the release of,

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:13.120
to have quite a bit of energy into preventing,

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.520
invest quite a bit of energy in not releasing that data.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.400
The reason why that doesn't tip me over

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.200
into the anti-vaxxer side

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.400
is because that's clinical trial data,

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.680
early clinical trial data

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.800
that involved several thousand people.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.920
We now have millions of data points

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.080
from people who have had the vaccine.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.760
This is real world data showing the efficacy of the vaccines.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.120
And so far, knock on wood,

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.200
there aren't side effects

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.120
that overcome the benefits of vaccine.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.480
So I'm with you.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.360
I'm now, I guess, three shots of the vaccine.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.720
But there's a lot of people that are kind of saying,

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.920
well, even the data on the real world use,

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.920
large scale data is messy.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.800
The way it's being reported,

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.760
the way it's being interpreted.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.520
Well, one thing is clear to me

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.280
that it is being politicized.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.120
That it's, I mean, if you just look objectively,

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.760
don't have to go to, at the shallow surface level,

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.120
it seems like there's two groups

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.000
that I can't even put a term to it

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.160
because it's not really pro-vaccine versus anti-vaccine

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.160
because it's pro-vaccine, triple mask,

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.680
Democrat, liberal, and then anti-mandate,

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.720
whatever those groups are.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.560
I can't quite, because they're changing.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.400
Anti-mask, but not really, but kind of.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.280
So those two groups that feel political in nature,

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.760
not scientific in nature, they're bickering.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.240
And then it's clear that this data is being interpreted

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.160
by the different groups differently.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.480
And it's very difficult for me as a human being

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.200
to understand where the truth lies,

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.120
especially given how much money is flying around

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.400
on all sides.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:19.400
So the anti-vaxxers can make a lot of money too.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.240
Let's not forget this.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.560
From the individual perspective,

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.280
you can become famous being an anti-vaxxer.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.120
And so there's a lot of incentives on all sides here.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.360
And there's real human emotion and fear,

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.320
and also credibility.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:41.120
Scientists don't wanna ruin their reputation

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.360
if they speak out in whatever, like speak their opinion,

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:49.560
or they look at some slice of the data

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.960
and begin to interpret it in some kind of way.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.000
It's clear that fear is dominating the discourse here,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.040
especially in the scientific community.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.360
So I don't know what to make of that.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.680
And the only happy people here is Pfizer.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.720
It's just plowing all ahead.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.280
I mean, with every single variant,

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.800
there's very, I would say,

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.920
outside of arguably a very flawed system,

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.000
there's a lot of incredible scientific

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.800
and engineering work being done

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.200
in constantly developing new antiviral drugs,

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.400
new vaccines to deal with the variants.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.560
So they're happily being a capitalist machine.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.560
And it's very difficult to know what to do with that.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.600
And let's just put this in perspective for folks.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.720
The best-selling drug in the world has been Humira

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.440
for a number of years.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:55.560
It's approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.760
and eight other indications.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:02.160
And it's sold about $20 billion globally

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.800
over the past few years.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.160
It leveled out, it peaked at that level.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.160
Pfizer expects to sell $65 billion of vaccine

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.280
in the first two years of the pandemic.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.960
So this is by far the biggest selling

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.680
and most profitable drug that's ever come along.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.000
Can I ask you a difficult question here?

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.520
In the fog that we're operating in here,

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.680
on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.440
what was done well and what was done badly

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.840
that you can see now?

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:50.080
It seems like we'll know more decades from now.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.360
Yes.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.640
But now, in the fog of today,

01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.920
with the $65 billion flying around,

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.240
where do you land?

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:08.520
We're gonna get to what I think is one of the key problems

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.240
with the pharmaceutical industry model in the United States

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:15.040
about being profit-driven.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:21.040
So in 2016, the NIH did the key infrastructure work

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:24.640
to make mRNA vaccines.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.840
That gets left out of the discussion a lot.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.200
And Pfizer-BioNTech actually paid royalties

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.520
voluntarily to the NIH.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.360
I don't know how much it was.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.040
I don't think it was a whole lot of money.

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.720
But I think they wanted to avoid the litigation

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.720
that Moderna got itself into

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.880
by just taking that 2016 knowledge

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.160
and having that be the foundation of their product.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.680
So Pfizer took that and they did their R&D.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:59.200
They paid for their R&D, having received that technology.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.800
And when they got the genetic code from China

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.800
about the virus, they very quickly made a vaccine

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.960
and the vaccine works.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.840
And President Trump, to his credit,

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.080
launched Operation Warp Speed

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.160
and just threw money at the problem.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.440
They just said, we spent five times more per person

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.200
than the EU early on.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.880
Just pay them whatever they want.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.400
Let's just get this going.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:32.400
And Americans were vaccinated more quickly.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.200
We paid a lot of money.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.160
The one mistake that I think the federal government made

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.680
was they were paying these guaranteed fortunes

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:45.360
and they didn't require that the companies participate

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.080
in a program to do global vaccinations.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.520
So the companies, doing their business model,

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.520
distributed the vaccines

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.280
where they would make the most money.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.120
And obviously they would make the most money

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.040
in the first world.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.240
And almost all, I think 85% of the vaccines early on

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.960
went to the first world.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.600
And very, very few vaccinations went to the third world.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.600
So what happened is there was such a low vaccination rate

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.280
in May of 2021.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:23.120
There was a all hands on deck cry for help

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.200
from the World Trade Organization,

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.880
the World Health Organization,

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.880
the IMF and the World Bank made a plea for $50 billion

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.080
so that we could get to 40% vaccination rate

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.320
in the third world by the end of 2021.

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.480
And it was unrequited, nobody answered.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:53.880
And now Africa has about a 8.9% vaccination rate.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:57.120
India is coming up, but it's been very low.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.120
The problem with all this is I believe those mRNA vaccines

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.880
are excellent vaccines.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.000
But if we leave the third world unvaccinated,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.800
we're gonna have a constant supply of variants of COVID

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.840
that are gonna come back into the United States

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.800
and harm Americans exactly like Delta and Omicron have.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.000
So we've made a great drug.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.760
It reduces the risk of mortality

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.440
in Americans who get it by a lot,

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.120
but we're not doing what we need to do

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.320
to protect Americans from Omicron.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.800
You don't have to be an idealist

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.000
and worry about global vaccine equity.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.320
If you just ordinary selfish people like most of us are,

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.640
and you're worried about the health of Americans,

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.320
you would ensure global vaccine distribution.

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.160
Let me just make one more point.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.800
That $50 billion that was requested

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:55.280
by the four organizations back in May of 2021,

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.360
32 billionaires made $50 billion

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.480
from the vaccines at that point,

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.000
took it into their private wealth.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.080
So what had been taken,

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.280
these enormous amounts of money

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.400
that had been taken into private wealth

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.640
was enough to do what those organizations said

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.800
needed to be done to prevent the sub-variants

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.680
from coming back and doing what they're doing.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.880
So the money was there,

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:21.360
but how does the money-driven motivation of Big Pharma

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:26.360
lead to that kind of allocation of vaccines?

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.920
Because they can make more money in the United States.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.560
Yeah, they're gonna distribute their vaccines

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.040
where they can make the most money.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.880
Right.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.880
Is there a malevolent aspect to this where,

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.040
boy, I don't like saying this,

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.040
but that they don't see it as a huge problem

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.640
that variants will come back to the United States.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.960
I think it's the issue we were talking about earlier on

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.560
where they're in a different culture

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.480
and their culture is that their moral obligation,

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.600
as Milton Fridman would say,

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.760
is to maximize the profits that they return to shareholders.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.600
And don't think about the bigger picture.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.560
The collateral damage.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.760
Don't think about the collateral damage.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.840
And also kind of believe,

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.800
convince yourself that if we give into

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.160
this capitalist machine

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.160
in this very narrow sense of capitalism,

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.920
that in the end they'll do the most good.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.480
This kind of belief that if we just maximize profits,

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.640
we'll do the most good.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.800
Yeah, that's an orthodoxy of several decades ago.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.200
And I don't think people can really say that in good faith.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.720
When you're talking about vaccinating the third world

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.920
so we don't get hurt,

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.280
it's a little bit hard to make the argument

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.520
that the world's a better place

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:51.080
because the profits of the investors went up.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.480
Yeah, but at the same time,

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.240
I think that's a belief you can hold.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.280
I mean, I've interacted with a bunch of folks that kind of,

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.480
it's the, I don't want to mischaracterize Ayn Rand, okay?

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.400
I respect a lot of people,

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:10.120
but there's, it's a belief that can take hold.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.920
If I just focus on this particular maximization,

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.040
it will do the most good for the world.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:19.200
The problem is when you choose what to maximize

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.720
and you put blinders on,

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:24.720
it's too easy to start making gigantic mistakes

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.160
that have a big negative impact on society.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.760
So it really matters what you're maximizing.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.720
Right, and if we had a true democracy

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.320
and everybody had one vote,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.600
everybody got decent information and had one vote,

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:44.080
Ayn Rand's position would get some votes, but not many.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.840
And it would be way outvoted by the common people.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.840
Let me ask you about this very difficult topic

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:58.840
I'm talking to Mark Zuckerberg of Metta,

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.040
the topic of censorship.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.760
I don't know if you've heard,

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:08.960
but there's a guy named Robert Malone and Peter McCullough

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.880
that were removed from many platforms

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.200
for speaking about the COVID vaccine as being risky.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.800
They were both on Joe Rogan's program.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:22.480
What do you think about censorship in this space,

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.640
in this difficult space where so much is controlled by,

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.600
not controlled, but influenced by advertisements

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.600
from Big Pharma,

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.160
and science can even be influenced by Big Pharma.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.320
Where do you lean on this?

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:46.320
Should we allow, should we lean towards freedom

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:50.120
and just allow all the voices,

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:54.560
even those that go against the scientific consensus?

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.560
Is that one way to fight the science

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.600
that is funded by Big Pharma,

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.360
or is that do more harm than good,

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.440
having too many voices that are contending here?

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.640
Should the ultimate battle be fought

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:15.120
in the space of scientific publications?

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:19.360
And particularly in the era of COVID,

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.600
where there are large public health ramifications

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.440
to this public discourse, the ante is way up.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.000
So I don't have a simple answer to that.

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.800
I think everyone's allowed their own opinion.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.680
I don't think everyone's allowed their own scientific facts.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:42.240
And how we develop a mechanism

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:45.360
that's other than an open internet

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.560
where whoever is shouting the loudest gets the most clicks

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.240
and rage creates value on the internet,

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.200
I think that's not a good mechanism for working this out.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.760
And I don't think we have one.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.800
I don't have a solution to this.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.320
I mean, ideally, if we had a philosopher king,

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.720
we could have a panel of people

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.800
who were not conflicted by rigid opinions

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.840
decide on what the boundaries of public discourse might be.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:21.800
I don't think it should be fully open.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.440
I don't think people who are making,

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.360
who are committed to an anti-vaccine position

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.040
and will tailor their interpretation

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.960
of complex scientific data to support their opinion,

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.800
I think that can be harmful.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.280
Constraining their speech can be harmful as well.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.200
So I don't have an answer here, but yeah.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.800
I tend to believe that it's more dangerous

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.360
to censor anti-vax messages.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.400
The way to defeat anti-vax messages

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:56.480
is by being great communicators,

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.360
by being great scientific communicators.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.360
So it's not that we need to censor the things we don't like.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.760
We need to be better communicating

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.080
the things we do like or the things that we do believe

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.920
represent a deep scientific truth.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:18.400
Because I think if you censor,

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.600
you get worse at doing science

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.840
and you give the wrong people power.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.960
So I tend to believe that you should give power

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.400
to the individual scientists

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.720
and also give them the responsibility

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.880
of being better educators, communicators,

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.680
expressers of scientific ideas,

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.480
put pressure on them to release data,

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.800
to release that data in a way that's easily consumable,

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.200
not just like very difficult to understand,

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.760
but in a way that can be understood

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.520
by a large number of people.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:57.160
So the battle should be fought in the open space of ideas

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:02.160
versus in the quiet space of journals.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.960
I think we no longer have that comfort,

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.280
especially at the highest of stakes.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:11.600
So this kind of idea that a couple of peer reviewers

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.280
decide the fate of billions

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.920
doesn't seem to be sustainable,

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.920
especially given a very real observation now

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:29.160
that the reason Robert Malone has a large following

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.960
is there's a deep distrust of institutions,

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.480
deep distrust of scientists, of science as an institution,

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.320
of power centers, of companies, of everything,

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.840
and perhaps rightfully so.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.360
But the way to defend against that

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.560
is not for the powerful to build a bigger wall,

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.560
it's for the powerful to be authentic

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.680
and maybe a lot of them to get fired

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.000
and for new minds, for new fresh scientists

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.160
once who are more authentic, more real,

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.360
better communicators to step up.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:08.360
So I fear censorship because it feels like

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:13.120
censorship is an even harder job to do it well

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.040
than being good communicators.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.560
And it seems like it's always the C students

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.760
that end up doing the censorship.

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.400
It's always the incompetent people,

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.560
and not just the incompetent,

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.800
but the biggest whiners.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.000
So like what happens is the people

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.560
that get the most emotional and the most outraged

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.240
will drive the censorship.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.600
And it doesn't seem like reason drives the censorship.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.880
That's just objectively observing

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.000
how censorship seems to work in this current.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.800
So there's so many forms of censorship.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.960
You look at the Soviet Union with the propaganda

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.320
or Nazi Germany, it's a very different level

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:57.840
of censorship, people tend to conflate

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.400
all of these things together.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.760
Social media trying desperately to have trillions

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.320
or hundreds of billions of exchanges a day

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.680
and like try to make sure that their platform

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.680
has some semblance of like, quote, healthy conversations.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.600
Like people just don't go insane.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.880
They actually like using the platform

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.440
and they censor based on that.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.960
That's a different level of censorship.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.080
But even there, you can really run afoul

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.480
of the people that get the whiny C students

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:34.920
controlling too much of the censorship.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:39.520
I believe you should actually put the responsibility

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.520
on the self-proclaimed holders of truth,

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.680
aka scientists, at being better communicators.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:47.640
I agree with that.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.480
I'm not advocating for any kind of censorship,

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.640
but Marshall McLuhan was very influential

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.200
when I was in college.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:02.200
And his, that meme, the medium is the message.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.880
It's a little bit hard to understand

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.840
when you're comparing radio to TV

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.960
and saying radio's hotter or TV's hotter or something.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.560
But we now have the medium is the message

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:16.280
in a way that we've never seen, we've never imagined before

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.280
where rage and anger and polarization

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:27.480
are what drives the traffic on the internet.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:33.240
And we don't, it's a question of building the commons.

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.080
Ideally, I don't know how to get there.

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.480
So I'm not pretending to have a solution,

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:42.320
but the commons of discourse about this particular issue,

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:47.200
about vaccines, has been largely destroyed by the edges,

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:50.120
by the drug companies and the advocates on the one side

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.120
and the people who just criticize and think that

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.760
even though the data are flawed,

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:01.040
that there's no way vaccines can be beneficial.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.120
And to have those people screaming at each other

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:09.120
does nothing to improve the health of the 95%

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:13.640
of the people in the middle who want to know

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.520
what the rational way to go forward is

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.600
and protect their families from COVID

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:21.520
and live a good life and be able to participate

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:25.240
in the economy, and that's the problem.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.480
I don't have a solution.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.600
Well, there's a difficult problem for Spotify and YouTube.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.400
I don't know if you heard, this is a thing

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.640
that Joe Rogan is currently going through as a platform

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.880
whether to censor the conversation that,

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.200
for example, Joe is having.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.080
So I don't know if you heard, but Neil Young

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.960
and other musicians have kind of spoke out

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.800
and saying they're going to leave the platform

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.800
because Joe Rogan is allowed to be on this platform

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.400
having these kinds of conversations

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.040
with the likes of Robert Malone.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.840
And it's clear to me that Spotify and YouTube

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.320
are being significantly influenced by these extreme voices

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.360
I can mention on each side.

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.880
And it's also clear to me that Facebook is the same

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.760
and it was going back and forth.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.360
In fact, that's why Facebook has been oscillating

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:12.680
on the censorship is like one group gets louder

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:16.280
than the other, depending on whether it's an election year.

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.280
There's several things to say here.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.640
So one, it does seem, I think you put it really well,

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.560
it would be amazing if these platforms

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:29.440
could find mechanisms to listen to the center,

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:34.440
to the big center that's actually going to be affected

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:39.400
by the results of our pursuit of scientific truth, right?

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.200
And listen to those voices.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.840
I also believe that most people are intelligent enough

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.400
to process information and to make up their own minds.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.720
Like they're not in terms of,

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.280
it's complicated, of course,

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.160
because we've just been talking about advertisement

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.920
and how people can be influenced.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.920
But I feel like if you have raw long form podcasts

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.480
or programs where people express their mind

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:12.440
and express their argument in full,

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:15.520
I think people can hear it to make up their own mind.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.760
And if those arguments have a platform

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.160
on which they can live,

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.240
then other people could provide better arguments

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.680
if they disagree with it.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.040
And now we as human beings,

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.320
as rational as intelligent human beings,

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.600
can look at both and make up our minds.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.080
And that's where social media can be very good

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.920
at like this collective intelligence.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:39.200
We together listen to all of these voices

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.680
and make up our own mind.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.160
Humble ourselves actually often.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.720
You think, you know, like you're an expert,

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.640
say you have a PhD in a certain thing,

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.960
so there's this confidence that comes with that.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:54.360
And the collective intelligence uncensored

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.920
allows you to humble yourself eventually.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.520
Like as you discovery, all it takes is a few times,

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:05.080
looking back five years later,

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.280
realizing I was wrong.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.080
And that's really healthy for a scientist,

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.040
that's really healthy for anybody you go through,

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.920
and only through having that open discourse

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.960
can you really have that.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:20.960
That said, Spotify also, just like Pfizer is a company,

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.760
which is why this podcast,

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:29.240
I don't know if you know what RSS feeds are,

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:31.560
but podcasts can't be censored.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:33.320
So Joe's in the unfortunate position

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:35.360
that he only lives on Spotify.

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.480
So Spotify has been actually very good at saying

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:40.680
we're staying out of it for now.

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.840
But RSS, this is pirate radio.

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.080
Nobody can censor, it's the internet.

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:51.880
So financially, in terms of platforms,

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.680
this cannot be censored,

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.800
which is why podcasts are really beautiful.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:01.800
And so if Spotify or YouTube wants to be the host

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:07.000
of podcasts, I think where they flourish

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000
is free expression, no matter how crazy.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.560
Yes, but I do wanna push back a little bit

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.440
on what you're saying.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:23.080
I have anti-facts friends who I love.

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:26.120
And they're dear, cherished friends.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.640
And they'll send me stuff.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.200
And it'll take me an hour to go through what they sent

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.560
to see if it is credible.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.520
And usually it's not.

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.800
It's not a random sample of the anti-facts argument.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.760
I'm not saying I can disprove the anti-facts argument,

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.160
but I am saying that it's almost like

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.800
we were talking about how medical science,

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:55.640
clinical trials, the presentation of clinical trials

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.920
to physicians could be improved.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.520
And the first thing we came up with

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:04.360
is to have pre-publication transparency

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.160
in the peer review process.

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.680
So bad information, biased information,

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:11.720
doesn't get out as if it's legitimate

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:16.120
and you can't put it back, recapture it once it gets out.

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.360
I think there's an element of that

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.960
in the arguments that are going on about vaccines.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.200
And they're on both sides,

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.800
but I think the anti-facts side

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:30.200
puts out more units of information

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.480
claiming to show that the vaccines don't work.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.520
And I guess in an ideal situation,

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:39.520
there would be real-time fact-checking

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.160
by independent people, not to censor it,

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.880
but to just say that study was set up to do this

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.960
and this is what the conclusions were.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:52.440
So the way it was stated is on one side of this argument.

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:55.040
But that's what I'm arguing, yeah, I agree with you.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:58.480
What I'm arguing is that this big network of humans

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.960
that we have, that is the collective intelligence,

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.000
can do that real-time if you allow it to,

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.720
if you encourage people to do it.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.200
And the scientists, as opposed to, listen,

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:10.400
I interact with a lot of colleagues,

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.520
a lot of friends that are scientists,

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.040
they roll their eyes.

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:16.480
Their response is like, ugh.

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.840
Like, they don't want to interact with this.

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:22.920
But that's just not the right response.

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:26.440
When a huge number of people believe this,

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.040
it is your job as communicators to defend your ideas.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:33.080
It is no longer the case that you go to a conference

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.480
and defend your ideas to two other nerds

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.600
that have been working on the same problem forever.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.360
I mean, sure, you can do that,

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:44.080
but then you're rejecting the responsibility

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.120
that you have explicitly or implicitly accepted

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.880
when you go into this field,

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.680
that you will defend the ideas of truth.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.880
And the way to defend them is in the open battlefield

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.000
of ideas and become a better communicator.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.040
And I believe that when you have a large,

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.840
you said you invested one or two hours in this particular,

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.840
but that's little ants interacting at scale,

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:12.080
I think that allows us to progress towards truth,

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.640
at least, you know, at least I hope so.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:15.960
I think you're an optimist.

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.000
I want to work with you a little bit on this.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.560
Let's say a person like Joe Rogan,

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.120
who by the way, had me on his podcast and let me-

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:28.120
It was an amazing conversation, I really enjoyed it.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.040
Well, thank you, I did too.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.560
And I didn't know Joe,

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.920
I didn't know much about his podcast.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.520
You pushed back on Joe a bunch, which is great.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.680
And he was- I love it.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.520
He was a gentleman and we had it out.

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.680
In fact, he put one clip,

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:43.160
at one point he said something that was a little bit wrong

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:44.320
and I corrected him.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.480
And he had the guy-

01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.440
Jamie. Jamie.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.520
He had Jamie check it and was very forthright

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.600
in saying, yeah, you know, John's got a right here.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:54.920
We got to modify this a little bit.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.600
In any event, in any event-

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.200
You got him.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.040
Well, I wasn't trying to get him.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.520
I was just trying to get him.

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:03.400
You're totally, it was a beautiful exchange.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.920
There's so much respect in the room,

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.440
pushing back and forth, that was great.

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.040
Yeah, so I respect him.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:13.200
And I think when he has somebody on

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.760
who's a dyed in the wool anti-faxer,

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:21.680
the question is, how can you balance,

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.480
if it needs balance, in real time?

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.360
I'm not talking about afterwards.

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.760
I'm talking in real time.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.880
Maybe you record, well, he does record it obviously,

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.800
but maybe when there's a statement made

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:38.080
that is made as if it's fact-based,

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:43.080
maybe that statement should be checked by some folks

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:48.160
who, imaginary folks who are trustworthy.

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:52.440
And in real time, as that discussion is being played

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:57.440
on the podcast, to show what independent experts

01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.160
say about that claim.

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.280
That's a really interesting idea.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:01.640
By the way, for some reason,

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.040
this idea popped into my head now is,

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.640
I think real time is very difficult,

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:09.360
it's not difficult, but it kind of ruins the conversation

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.840
because you want the idea to breathe.

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:15.200
I think what's very possible is before it's published,

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:18.440
it's the pre-publication, before it's published,

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:20.400
you let a bunch of people review it

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:23.720
and they can add their voices in post,

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:25.280
before it's published.

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:30.280
They can add arguments, arguments against certain parts.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.960
That's very interesting to sort of, as one podcast,

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:38.520
publish addendums, publish the peer review

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.520
together with the publication.

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.760
That's very interesting.

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:45.320
I might actually do that, that's really interesting.

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.200
Because I've been doing more debates

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:51.760
where you at the same time have multiple people,

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.840
which has a different dynamic because both people,

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:58.880
I mean, it's really nice to have the time to pause

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.120
just by yourself to fact check,

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.200
to look at the study that was mentioned,

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.680
to understand what's going on.

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.560
So the peer review process, to have a little bit of time.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:10.640
That's really interesting.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:14.440
I actually would, I'd like to try that.

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.800
To agree with you on some point in terms of anti-vax,

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.720
I've been fascinated by listening to arguments

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.840
from this community of folks that's been quite large

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.440
called flat earthers,

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:28.120
the people that believe the earth is flat.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.960
And I don't know if you've ever listened to them

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.760
or read their arguments,

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.160
but it's fascinating how consistent

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:37.800
and convincing it all sounds

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.600
when you just kind of take it in.

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.720
Just like, just take it in like listening normally.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:45.360
It's all very logical.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:49.880
Like if you don't think very, well, no.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:55.560
So the thing is, the reality is,

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.280
at the very basic human level

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.600
with our limited cognitive capabilities,

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:03.680
the earth is pretty flat when you go outside

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.880
and you look, it's flat.

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.040
So like when you use common sense reasoning,

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.960
it's very easy to play to that,

01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:12.080
to convince you that the earth is flat.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:13.640
Plus there's powerful organizations

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.240
that want to manipulate you and so on.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:20.240
But then there's the whole progress

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.600
of science and physics of the past,

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:26.120
but that's difficult to integrate into your thought process.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.680
So it's very true that the people should listen

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:33.400
to flat earthers because it was very revealing to me

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.800
how easily it is, how easy it is to be convinced

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:41.800
of basically anything by charismatic arguments.

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:43.320
Right.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.960
And if we're arguing about whether the earth is flat or not,

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.800
as long as we're not navigating airplanes

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.960
and doing other kinds of things,

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:53.840
trying to get satellites to do transmission,

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:56.240
it's not that important what we believe.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.520
But if we're arguing about how we approach

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.400
the worst public health crisis in,

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.360
I don't know how long, I think we're getting worse

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.400
than the Spanish flu now.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.840
I don't know what the total global deaths

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.120
with Spanish flu were, but in the United States,

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:12.480
we certainly have more deaths than we had from Spanish flu.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.720
Plus the economic pain and suffering.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:15.800
Yes, yes.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:19.720
And the damage to the kids in school and so forth.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.080
We got a problem and it's not going away, unfortunately.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.040
So when we get a problem like that,

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.560
it's not just an interesting bar room conversation

01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:30.720
about whether the earth is flat,

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:32.600
there are millions of lives involved.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.200
Let me ask you yet another question,

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.320
issue I raised with Pfizer CEO Albert Burla.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:45.400
It's the question of revolving doors.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.440
That there seems to be a revolving door

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:51.120
between Pfizer, FDA and CDC.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.280
People that have worked at the FDA,

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:56.480
now work at Pfizer and vice versa,

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:58.640
including the CDC and so on.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.720
What do you think about that?

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.920
So first of all, his response once again,

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:06.440
is there's rules, there's very strict rules

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.520
and we follow them.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.320
Do you think that's a problem?

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.040
Ooh, ah.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.240
And also maybe this is a good time to talk about

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.240
this Pfizer play by the rules.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.360
Let's, one at a time.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.200
One at a time.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:22.760
Okay, and this isn't even about Pfizer,

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.320
but it's an answer to the question.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.160
Yes.

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.480
So there's this drug, Adjahelm,

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.320
that was approved by the FDA maybe six months ago.

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:34.960
It's a drug to prevent the progression

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:37.160
of low grade Alzheimer's disease.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:43.360
The target for drug development for Alzheimer's disease

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.120
has been the amyloid,

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:48.000
reducing the amyloid plaques in the brain,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.120
which correlate with the progression of Alzheimer's.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:57.120
And Biogen showed that its drug, Adjahelm,

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:01.000
reduces amyloid plaques in the brain.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.040
They did two clinical trials

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.640
to determine the clinical efficacy

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.920
and they found that neither trial

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.000
showed a meaningful benefit.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.200
And in those two trials,

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.000
33% more people in the Adjahelm group

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.080
develop symptomatic brain swelling and bleeding

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.840
than people in the placebo group.

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:25.960
There was an advisory committee convened

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.440
to debate and determine how they felt

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.120
about the approvability of Adjahelm, given those facts.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.160
And those facts aren't in dispute.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:41.600
They're in Biogen slides as well as FDA documents.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:46.600
The advisory committee voted 10 against approval

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:49.960
and one abstain.

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:52.640
So that's essentially universal,

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.280
unanimous vote against approving Adjahelm.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:00.720
Now the advisory committees have been pretty much cleansed

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:03.280
of financial conflicts of interest.

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:08.280
So this advisory committee votes 10 no, one abstention,

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.200
and the FDA overrules the unanimous opinion

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:16.160
of its advisory committee and approves the drug.

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:21.360
Three of the members of the advisory committee resign.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.360
They say we're not gonna be part,

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.800
if the FDA is not gonna listen to a unanimous vote

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:26.720
against approving this drug,

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.560
which shows more harm than benefit, undisputed,

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:33.840
we're not gonna participate in this.

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.680
And the argument against approval

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:38.960
is that the surrogate endpoint,

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.360
the reduction of amyloid, the progression of amyloid plaques

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:48.040
is known by the FDA not to be a valid clinical indicator.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.920
It doesn't correlate, 27 studies have shown

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.360
it doesn't correlate with clinical progression.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.840
Interrupting the amyloid plaques

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:59.840
doesn't mean that your Alzheimer's doesn't get worse.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.200
So it seems like it's a slam dunk

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:06.920
and the FDA made a mistake

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.360
and they should do whatever they do

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:12.080
to protect their bureaucratic reputation.

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:15.280
So the head of the Bureau of the FDA,

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.320
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.240
that approves new drugs,

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:23.120
who had spent 16 years as an executive

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.320
in the pharmaceutical industry,

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.080
issued a statement and said,

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.000
what we should do in this situation

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
is to loosen the prohibition of financial ties of interest

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:41.280
with the drug companies so we get less emotional responses.

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:46.160
I said this, it's in print.

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:51.560
People are just too emotional about this.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.960
People were just too emotional,

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.080
the 10 people who voted against it

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.720
and the no people who voted for it,

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.480
it's all too emotional.

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.000
So this gets back,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.560
this is a long answer to your short question.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.880
I think this is a wonderful window

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:07.120
into the thinking of the FDA

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.160
that financial conflicts of interest don't matter

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.280
in a situation when I think it's obvious

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.000
that they would matter.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.040
But there's not a direct financial conflict of interest.

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:21.200
It's kind of, like it's not,

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:26.120
like Albert said, there's rules.

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.440
I mean, you're not allowed to have

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.760
direct financial conflict of interest.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.280
It's indirect.

01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.560
Right, but what I'm saying is,

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:36.560
I'm not denying what he said is true,

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.760
but the FDA, a high official in the FDA

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.240
is saying that we need to allow conflicts of interest

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:47.000
in our advisory committee meetings.

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:53.440
And that, she wants to change the rules.

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.840
So Albert Borla would still be playing by the rules,

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:02.840
but it just shows how one side of the thinking here is.

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:05.080
But you think that's influenced by the fact

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.360
that there were pharmaceutical executives

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.920
working at the FDA and vice versa.

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.720
And they think that's a great idea.

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.520
Who gets to fix this?

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.480
Do you think it should be just banned?

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.520
Like if you worked. I don't know.

01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:19.040
Two separate questions.

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.280
One is, should the officials at the FDA

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:24.800
come from pharma and vice versa?

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.440
Yes. That's one question.

01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:27.400
And the other question is,

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:28.960
should advisory committee members

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.680
be allowed to have financial conflicts of interest?

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.120
Yes.

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.120
I think in my opinion, and people might say I'm biased,

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.320
I think advisory committee people

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.080
should not have conflicts of interest.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.880
I think their only interest ought to be the public interest.

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:49.240
And that was true from my understanding of the situation.

01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:51.280
It's the afterward in my book,

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:54.200
I spent some time studying it about Aja Helm.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.640
I think it's a slam dunk

01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.680
that there ought to be no conflicts of interest.

01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.400
Now the head of CDER, Center for Drug Evaluation Research,

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:04.680
thinks that that's gonna give you a biased result

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.400
because we don't have company influence.

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:12.400
And that I think shows how biased their thinking is.

01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.360
That not having company influence is a bias.

01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.200
Let me try to load that in.

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.320
I'm trying to empathize with the belief

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:26.760
that companies should have a voice at the table.

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.440
I mean, yeah, it's part of the game.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.400
They've convinced themselves

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.160
that this is how it should be played.

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:36.320
But they have a voice at the table.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.760
They've designed the studies.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.600
Right, that's their voice.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:40.440
That's the whole point.

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.280
They analyze the data.

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.080
I mean, what bigger voice do you deserve?

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.040
But I do also think on the more challenging question,

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.200
I do think that there should be a ban.

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:53.600
If you work at a pharmaceutical company,

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.400
you should not be allowed to work

01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:00.400
at any regulatory agency.

01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.200
You should not.

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.000
I mean, that, going back and forth,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.680
it's just, even if it's 30 years later.

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:07.520
Yeah, I agree.

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.000
And I have another nomination for a ban.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.960
We're in this crazy situation

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.120
where Medicare is not allowed to negotiate

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.800
the price of drugs with the drug companies.

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.840
So the drug companies get a patent on a new drug.

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.440
Unlike every other developed country,

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.000
they can charge whatever they want.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.800
So they have a monopoly on a utility

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.560
because no one else can make the drug.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.960
Charge whatever they want and Medicare has to pay for it.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.640
And you say, how did we get in this crazy situation?

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.600
So how we got here is that in 2003,

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.000
when Medicare Part D was passed,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.680
Billy Towson was head of the Ways and Means Committee

01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:48.960
in the House, played a key role in ushering this through

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.440
with the non-negotiation clause of it.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:53.960
And after it was passed,

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.480
Billy Towson did not finish out his term in Congress.

01:41:57.520 --> 01:42:00.400
He went to pharma for a $2 million a year job.

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:05.200
This is incredible.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:08.000
You might think that a ban on that would be a good idea.

01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.120
I spoke with Francis Collins, head of the NIH

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:13.720
on this podcast.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.720
He and NIH have a lot of power over funding in science.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.560
What are they doing right?

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:25.000
What are they doing wrong?

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.480
In this interplay with big pharma, how connected are they?

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:33.760
Again, returning to the question,

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.520
what are they doing right?

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.720
What are they doing wrong in your view?

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.200
So my knowledge of the NIH is not as granular

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.320
as my knowledge of pharma.

01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:47.560
That said, in broad brushstrokes,

01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:51.240
the NIH is doing the infrastructure work

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.440
for all drug development.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:56.680
I think they've participated in 100% of the drugs

01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:58.880
that have been approved by the FDA

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.560
over the past 10 years or so.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.040
They've done infrastructure work.

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:08.040
And what they do is not work on particular drugs,

01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:12.320
but they develop work on drug targets,

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.880
on targets in the human body that can be affected by drugs

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.520
and might be beneficial to turn on or off.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:24.560
And then the drug companies, when they find a target

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:29.360
that is mutable and potentially beneficial,

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.040
then the drug companies can take the research

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:34.640
and choose to invest in the development of the drugs,

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.640
specific drug.

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.360
That's our model.

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.360
Now, 96% of the research that's done in clinical trials

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.280
in the United States is about drugs and devices.

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.960
And only a fraction of the 4% that's left over

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.800
is about preventive medicine

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:54.480
and how to make Americans healthier.

01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.520
I think, again, from the satellite view,

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:03.520
the NIH is investing more in science

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.280
that can lead to commercial development

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:10.160
rather than, as you said at the beginning of the podcast,

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.480
there's no big fitness and lifestyle industry

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:16.000
that can counter pharma.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.720
So I think at the NIH level, that countering can be done.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.560
And the diabetes prevention program study

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:23.640
that we talked about before,

01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:26.480
where lifestyle was part of a randomized trial

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:28.920
and was shown to be more effective than metformin

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.960
at preventing the development of diabetes,

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:34.440
that is absolute proof positive

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.120
that investing in that kind of science

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.880
can produce good results.

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:42.880
So I think that we're aimed at drug development

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:44.840
and what we ought to be aimed at

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.680
is an epidemiological approach

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:49.880
to improving the health of all Americans.

01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:54.120
We rank 68th in the world in healthy life expectancy,

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:58.960
despite spending an extra trillion and a half dollars a year.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.960
And I believe strongly that the reason why we've gotten

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:09.200
in this crazy position is because the knowledge

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.480
that we're producing is about new drugs and devices,

01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:15.760
and it's not about improving population health.

01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:19.680
In this problem, the NIH is the perfect institution

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.160
to play a role in rebalancing our research agenda.

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.960
And some of that is on the leadership side

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:27.920
with Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci,

01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:32.440
not just speaking about basically everything

01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:34.760
that just leads to drug development, vaccine development,

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.760
but also speaking about healthy lifestyles

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.800
and speaking about health, not just sickness.

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.240
Yes, and investing, investing in health.

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:48.240
I mean, it's like one fee is the other.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.200
One, you have to communicate to the public

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:53.920
the importance of investing in health,

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.840
and that leads to you getting props for investing in health

01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.880
and then you can invest in health more and more.

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:01.680
That communicates, I mean,

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.120
everything that Anthony Fauci says or Francis Collins says

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.240
has an impact on scientists.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:12.120
I mean, it sets the priorities.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.080
I don't think they, it's the sad thing about leaders,

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:22.080
forgive me for saying the word, but mediocre leaders,

01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:26.000
is they don't see themselves as part of a game.

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.920
They don't see the momentum.

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.160
It's like a fish in the water.

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.960
They don't see the water.

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:36.080
Great leaders stand up and reverse the direction

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:37.120
of how things are going.

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:39.920
And I actually put a lot of responsibility,

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.520
some people say too much, but whatever.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:46.440
I think leaders carry the responsibility.

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.800
I put a lot of responsibility on Anthony Fauci

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:51.360
and Francis Collins for not actually speaking

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.880
a lot more about health, not, and bigger,

01:46:55.880 --> 01:47:00.880
inspiring people in the power

01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:05.560
and the trustworthiness of science.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:11.560
You know, that's on the shoulders of Anthony Fauci.

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.800
I'm gonna abstain from that

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.840
because I'm not expert enough, but.

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.800
Neither am I, but I'm opinionated.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.120
I am too, but not on camera.

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:22.560
Yes.

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.240
No, but seriously, the problem is pretty simple,

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:31.440
that we're investing 96% of our funding

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:33.640
of clinical research in drugs and devices,

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.840
and 80% of our health is determined

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:38.160
by how we live our lives.

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:39.200
Yes.

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.920
And this is ridiculous.

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.000
We're, the United States is going further

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.920
and further behind the other wealthy countries

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.800
in terms of our health.

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.640
We ranked 38th in healthy life expectancy in 2000,

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.040
and now we're spending a trillion and a half dollars extra,

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.400
and we rank 68th.

01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.560
We've gone down.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:00.960
You have this excellent,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.240
there's a few charts that I'll overlay

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:09.240
that tell this story in really powerful ways.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:13.640
So one is the healthcare spending is percentage of GDP

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.760
that on the X axis is years and the Y axis is percentage,

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:20.840
and the United States as compared to other countries,

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:25.840
on average, has been much larger and growing.

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:30.560
Right, we are now spending 7% more of our GDP,

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.240
17.7% versus 10.7% on healthcare.

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:38.880
7%, and I think GDP is the fairest way

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:40.760
to compare healthcare spending.

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.520
Per person, in dollars, we're spending even,

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.600
the difference is even greater,

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.240
but other costs vary with GDP.

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.840
So let's stick with the conservative way to do it.

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.840
17.7, no, 18% of GDP.

01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.760
18% of GDP spent on healthcare,

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.800
7% higher than the comparable country average.

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:05.640
Right.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:09.960
17.7% versus 10.7, 7% higher.

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.960
Right, and 7% of $23 trillion GDP

01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:19.040
is more than $1.5 trillion a year in excess.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.520
And then you have another chart

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:23.440
that shows healthcare system performance

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.840
compared to spending.

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:29.800
And there's a point cloud of different countries,

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.160
the x-axis being healthcare spending

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.360
is a percentage of GDP, which we just talked about,

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.880
that US is 7% higher than the average.

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:44.520
And then on the y-axis is performance.

01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:48.280
So x-axis spending, y-axis performance.

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.680
And there's a point cloud,

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:52.400
we'll overlay this if you're watching on YouTube,

01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:57.040
of a bunch of countries that have high performance

01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:00.120
for what they're spending.

01:50:00.120 --> 01:50:04.680
And then US is all alone

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:07.520
on the right bottom side of the chart

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.800
where it's low performance and high spending.

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:11.640
Correct.

01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:17.920
So this is a system that is abiding by spending

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.200
that is directed by the most profitable ways

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.520
to deliver healthcare.

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:25.080
So you put that in the hands of big pharma,

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:27.320
is you maximize for profit,

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:31.640
you're going to decrease performance and increase spending.

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.840
Yes, but I wanna qualify that and say,

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.400
it's not all big pharma's fault.

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.360
They're not responsible for all the problems

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.240
in our healthcare system.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.240
They're not responsible for the administrative costs,

01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:44.560
for example.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:47.440
But they are the largest component

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.360
of our rising healthcare costs.

01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:54.200
And it has to do with this knowledge issue.

01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.800
Controlling the knowledge that doctors have

01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:01.280
makes it so that doctors can live with this situation

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:04.920
believing that it's optimal when it's a wreck.

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.200
Yeah.

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:08.720
Let me ask you the big, so as a physician,

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:11.640
so everything you've seen,

01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:16.000
we've talked about 80% of the impact on health is lifestyle.

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:20.160
How do we live longer?

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:22.120
What advice would you give to general people?

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:27.120
What space of ideas result

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:30.680
in living longer and higher quality lives?

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.560
Right, this is a very simple question to answer.

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:37.760
Exercise for at least a half hour,

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.360
at least five times a week.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.320
Number one.

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.160
Number two, don't smoke.

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:48.960
Number three, maintain a reasonably healthy body weight.

01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:53.320
Some people argue that being lower than a BMI of 25

01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:54.440
is healthy.

01:51:54.440 --> 01:51:56.080
I think that may be true,

01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.080
but I think getting above 30 is unhealthy.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.520
And that ought to be.

01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:06.520
Now, that's largely impacted by socioeconomic status.

01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.520
And we don't wanna blame the victims here.

01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:12.000
So we gotta understand that when we talk

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:14.920
about all of these things, not cigarettes,

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:18.360
but exercise and a good diet

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:21.320
and maintaining a healthy body weight,

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.120
we have to include in doing those things

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000
the impediments to people of lower socioeconomic status

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:34.360
being able to make those changes.

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:38.120
We've got to understand that personal responsibility

01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:39.880
accounts for some of this,

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.960
but also social circumstances accounts for some of it.

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:46.960
And back to your fish bowl analogy,

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:50.040
if you're swimming in a fish bowl,

01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:51.240
if you live in a fish tank

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:53.960
that's not being properly maintained,

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:58.080
the approach wouldn't be to treat individual sick fish,

01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:01.560
it would be to fix your fish tank

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.040
to get the bacteria out of it

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.720
and whatever bad stuff is in there

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:08.440
and make your fish tank healthier.

01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:12.800
Well, we invest far less than the other wealthy countries do.

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.120
We're flipped, we have the mirror image

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:19.040
in the spending on social determinants of health

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.840
and medical determinants of health.

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:23.120
We have exactly the wrong order.

01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.800
And not only does that choke off

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:28.320
social determinants of health, which are very important,

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:30.720
but actually just the ratio,

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:32.880
even if you were spending,

01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:35.800
if we raise the social spending

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:38.400
and raise our medical spending in proportion,

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:41.320
it's the ratio of social spending to medical spending

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.960
that's the problem.

01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.600
So, and why do we do that?

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.480
Well, the answer is perfectly obvious

01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:50.480
that the way to transfer money from working Americans

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.680
to investors is through the biomedical model,

01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.760
not through the social health model.

01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.960
And that's the problem for,

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.840
and I'd like to discuss this

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:06.360
because the market isn't gonna get us

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.040
to a reasonable allocation.

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:09.680
All the other wealthy countries

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:11.600
that are so much healthier than we are

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:14.040
and spending so much less than we are

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:17.360
have some form of government intervention

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:20.480
in the quality of the health data that's available,

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:25.120
in the budgeting of health and social factors.

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:28.040
And we don't, we're kind of the Wild West

01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:31.080
and we let the market determine those allocations

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.360
and it's an awful failure.

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:36.680
It's a horrendous failure.

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:39.800
So one argument against government,

01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:43.760
or sorry, an alternative to the government intervention

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:48.320
is the market can work better

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:51.680
if the citizenry has better information.

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:53.680
So one argument is that, you know,

01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:58.680
communicators, like podcasts and so on,

01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:01.080
but other channels of communication

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:03.840
will be the way to fight big pharma.

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.560
Your book is the way to, by providing information.

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:10.360
The alternative to the government intervention

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:11.760
on every aspect of this,

01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:13.400
including communication with the doctors,

01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.400
is to provide them other information

01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:18.600
and not allow the market to provide that information

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.440
by basically making it exciting

01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:27.000
to buy books, to make better and better communicators

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.840
on Twitter through books, through op-eds,

01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:32.960
through podcasts, through so on.

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:35.840
So basically, because there's a lot of incentive

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:40.400
to communicate against the messages of big pharma.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.640
There is incentive because people want to understand

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:44.760
what's good for their lives

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:46.880
and they're willing to listen to charismatic people

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:50.920
that are able to clearly explain what is good for them.

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:54.000
And they do, and more than 80% of people

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.480
think that drugs cost too much

01:55:55.480 --> 01:55:58.800
and the drug industry is too interested in profits.

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:02.320
But they still get influenced.

01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:05.200
They can't, you can't get the vote through Congress.

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.720
Democrats and Republicans alike

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.280
are taking money from Congress,

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:13.920
and somehow it just doesn't work out

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:17.200
that these, even small changes.

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:21.800
I mean, the pared down part of Medicare,

01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:26.800
the plan for increasing Medicare negotiation drug costs

01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:31.160
in Build Back Better, it's literally gonna reduce

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:36.000
the number of new drugs that are beneficial,

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.480
uniquely beneficial, by about one new drug

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.120
or two new drugs over 30 years.

01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:47.880
It will have virtually an indecipherable impact.

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.480
And yet pharma is talking about the impact on innovation.

01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:55.960
And if you vote for this,

01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:58.320
if you let your congressman vote for this,

01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:03.320
you're gonna severely slow down drug innovation

01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:07.040
and that's gonna affect the quality of your life.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Let me ask you about over-medication

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.680
that we've been talking about from different angles.

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:22.640
But one difficult question for me,

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:26.960
I'll just, I'll pick one of the difficult topics, depression.

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:31.960
So depression is a serious, painful condition

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.280
that leads to a lot of people suffering in the world.

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:38.920
And yet it is likely

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:42.360
they were over-prescribing antidepressants.

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:47.040
So as a doctor, as a patient, as a healthcare system,

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:50.320
as a society, what do we do with that fact?

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:53.040
That people suffer.

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:56.560
There's a lot of people suffering from depression

01:57:57.560 --> 01:57:59.160
and there's also people suffering

01:57:59.160 --> 01:58:01.960
from over-prescribing of antidepressants.

01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:02.880
Right.

01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:06.880
So a paper in the New England Journal by Eric Turner

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:09.240
showed that the data,

01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:12.360
if you put all the data together from antidepressants,

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:17.360
you find out that antidepressants are not effective

01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.400
for people who are depressed

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:21.120
but don't have a major depression.

01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:25.320
Major depression is a serious problem.

01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:27.300
People can't function normally.

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:31.040
They have a hard time getting out,

01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:34.240
performing their normal social roles.

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:39.480
But what's happened is that the publicity,

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:43.040
I mean, Prozac Nation was a good example

01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:44.960
of making the argument

01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:47.640
that why should people settle for normal happiness

01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:49.800
when they can have better than normal happiness?

01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:52.480
And if you're not having normal happiness,

01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:53.560
you should take a drug.

01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:58.560
Well, that concept that serotonin metabolism

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:03.560
is the root cause of depression

01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:05.520
is really a destructive one.

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:08.760
We have drugs that change serotonin metabolism

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:12.440
but we don't know if that's why antidepressants work

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:14.440
on major depression.

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.040
And they certainly don't work on everybody

01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:16.880
with major depression.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:18.520
I forget what the number needed to treat is.

01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:20.840
I think it's around four.

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:23.600
One out of four people have significant improvement.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:28.160
But the people without major depression don't get better.

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:30.920
And the vast majority of these drugs are used

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:33.720
for people without major depression.

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:37.320
So what's happened is that the feelings

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:40.360
of life satisfaction of happiness

01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:44.000
and not sadness have been medicalized.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.920
The normal range of feelings have been medicalized.

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:51.040
And that's not to say that they shouldn't be attended to

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:54.400
but the evidence shows that attending to them

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:57.080
by giving somebody a medicine doesn't help

01:59:57.080 --> 01:59:59.720
except that they feel like somebody cares about them

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:01.400
and believes that they're suffering.

02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:05.360
But there are problems in living that give rise

02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:10.080
to much of this symptomatology of less than major depression.

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:13.360
And let's call it what it is and figure out a way

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:16.720
to help people, individual therapy, group therapy,

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.880
maybe lifestyle modification would work.

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:20.880
We gotta try that.

02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:24.760
But let's call it what it is instead of saying,

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:29.240
oh, you're in this vast basket of people

02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:31.560
who are depressed so we'll give you an antidepressant

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:34.240
even though the evidence shows that people

02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:36.680
who are suffering from your level of depression

02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:38.240
don't get better.

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.600
And that's a consequence of not focusing

02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:46.080
on preventative medicine, the lifestyle changes,

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:47.160
all that kind of stuff.

02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:49.680
Well, yes, but it's really a consequence

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.080
of the drug companies creating the impression

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:54.760
that if you're sad, take a pill.

02:00:55.680 --> 02:01:00.680
If you're non-major depression,

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.440
how do you overcome depression?

02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:06.680
Well, you have to talk about what the problem is.

02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:09.880
So talk therapy, lifestyle changes.

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:12.280
Well, no, I'm not jumping to that.

02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:16.120
I'm saying that you ought to, A,

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:19.400
the way you feel must be respected.

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:21.160
Yeah, acknowledge that you're suffering.

02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:22.680
Acknowledge that you're suffering

02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:24.720
and deal with healthcare providers

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:27.240
who acknowledge that you're suffering.

02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:30.160
So let's take that first step.

02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:32.240
And then- Big first step also.

02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:33.560
Big first step, yeah.

02:01:33.560 --> 02:01:36.240
Family docs are pretty good at that.

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:39.840
That's kind of the arena that caused me

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.880
to go into family medicine,

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:44.240
the subjective experience of the patient.

02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:48.080
Okay, so you're a person who is not getting

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:49.600
the enjoyment out of their life

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:52.040
that they feel they ought to be getting.

02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:54.640
Now let's figure out why.

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:57.280
And whether that means some time with a social worker,

02:01:57.280 --> 02:01:59.040
some time with a psychiatrist,

02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:01.320
some time with a psychiatric nurse.

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:04.920
I'm not sure how you'd best do that most effectively

02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:07.480
and efficiently, but that's what you need to do.

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.680
And it may be that there's a marital problem

02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:13.600
and there's something going on

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:18.600
and one of the spouses can't find satisfaction

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:21.480
in the life they have to live within their relationship.

02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:24.640
Maybe there's a past history of trauma or abuse

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.800
that somebody is projecting onto their current situation.

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:31.080
Maybe there's socioeconomic circumstances

02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:34.760
where they can't find a job that gives them self-respect

02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:36.520
and enough money to live with.

02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:39.720
All, you know, an infinite range of things,

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:42.080
but let's figure out, make a diagnosis first.

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:45.440
The diagnosis isn't that the person feels sadder

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:48.640
than they want to feel.

02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.000
The diagnosis is why does the person feel sadder

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:53.160
than they want to feel?

02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:57.800
You mentioned this is what made you want to get

02:02:57.800 --> 02:02:59.280
into family medicine.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.120
As a doctor, what do you think about the saying

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.400
save one life, save the world?

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:13.800
This was always moving to me about doctors

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:16.760
because you have like this human in front of you

02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:20.920
and your time is worth money.

02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:26.240
Your, what you prescribe and your efforts

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:28.840
after the visit are worth money.

02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:31.840
And it seems like the task of the doctor

02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:36.840
is to not think about any of that or not the task,

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:42.480
but it seems like a great doctor,

02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:45.080
despite all that just forgets it all

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.000
and just cares about the one human.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.760
And somehow that feels like the love and effort you put

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:53.880
into helping one person is the thing

02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:55.440
that will save the world.

02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:58.440
It's not like some economic argument

02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:03.440
or some political argument or financial argument.

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:09.520
It's a very human drive that ultimately

02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:13.040
is behind all of this that will do good for the world.

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:15.600
Yes, I think that's true.

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.680
And at the same time, I think it's equally true

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:23.640
that all physicians need to have a sense of responsibility

02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:28.640
about how the common resources are allocated

02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:34.160
to serve the whole population's interest best.

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:36.400
That's a tension that you have as a physician.

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.440
Let's take the extreme example.

02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:41.440
Let's say you had a patient in front of you

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:46.400
who if you gave one $10 billion pill to,

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.720
you would save their life.

02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:52.400
I would just be tortured by that as a physician

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:56.120
because I know that $10 billion spent properly

02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:00.280
in an epidemiologically guided way

02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:03.600
is gonna save a whole lot more lives than one life.

02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:06.400
So it's also your responsibility as a physician

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.720
to walk away from that patient.

02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:10.600
I wouldn't say that.

02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:14.040
I think it's your responsibility to be tortured by it.

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:15.200
That's exactly right.

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.440
The human condition.

02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:24.720
That's a tough job, but yeah,

02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:27.720
to maintain your humanity through it all.

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:30.280
But you've been asking at different points

02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:35.280
in this conversation, why are doctors so complacent

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.880
about the tremendous amount of money we're spending?

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:41.480
Why do they accept knowledge from different sources

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:44.360
that may not pan out when they really know the truth?

02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:48.400
And the answer is that they're trying to do their best

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:49.520
for their patients.

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:57.720
It's the same kind of torture to figure out

02:05:57.720 --> 02:05:59.880
what the hell is going on with the data.

02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:03.440
And that's a sort of future project.

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:06.160
And maybe people will read my book

02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:08.120
and maybe they'll get a little more excited about it,

02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:10.160
become more legitimate in practice.

02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:13.640
I would feel like my life was worthwhile if that happened.

02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:17.160
But at the same time, they've got to do something

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:18.760
with the patient in front of them.

02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:21.120
They've got to make a decision.

02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:24.840
And they probably, there are not many weirdos like me

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.280
who invest their life in figuring out

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:28.320
what's behind the data.

02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.800
They're trying to get through the day

02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.640
and do the right thing for their patient.

02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:35.000
So they're tortured by that decision too.

02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:38.480
And so if you're not careful,

02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:43.480
big pharma can manipulate that drive

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:45.000
to try to help the patient,

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.760
that humanity of dealing with the uncertainty of it all.

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:52.000
Like what is the best thing to do?

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.840
Big pharma can step in and use money

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.560
to manipulate that humanity.

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:57.560
Yeah, I would state it quite differently.

02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:01.000
It's sort of an opt out rather than an opt in.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.480
Big pharma will do that and you need to opt out of it.

02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:10.960
What advice would you give to a young person today

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:13.240
in high school or college,

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:17.080
stepping into this complicated world

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:22.080
full of advertisements of big powerful institutions,

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:24.960
of big rich companies,

02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:27.120
how to have a positive impact in the world,

02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:29.480
how to live a life they can be proud of?

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:33.280
I would say should that person

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:38.120
who has only good motives go into medicine?

02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:39.760
They have an inclination to go into medicine

02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:42.040
and they've asked me what I think about that

02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:45.440
given what I know about the undermining

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:47.640
of American healthcare at this point.

02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:51.480
And my answer is if you got the calling, you should do it.

02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.320
You should do it because nobody's gonna do it

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:55.160
better than you.

02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:57.840
And if you don't have the calling

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:01.040
and you're in it for the money,

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.280
you're not gonna be proud of yourself.

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:07.720
How do you prevent yourself from doing,

02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:12.720
from letting the system change you over years and years,

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:17.960
like letting the game of pharmaceutical influence

02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:19.800
affect you?

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:22.600
It's a very hard question

02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:27.600
because the sociologic norms are to be affected.

02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:33.000
And to trust the sources of information

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.360
that are largely controlled by the drug industry.

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:38.240
And that's why I wrote Sickening

02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:43.240
is to try and help those people in the medical profession

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.640
to understand that what's going on right now looks normal,

02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:52.400
but it's not.

02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:55.480
The health of Americans is going downhill.

02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:57.040
Our society is getting ruined

02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:59.520
by the money that's getting pulled out

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:04.520
of other socially beneficial uses

02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:08.560
to pay for healthcare that is not helping us.

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:14.600
So fundamentally, the thing that is normal,

02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:19.120
not question the normal, don't.

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:23.680
If you conform, conform hesitantly.

02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:26.120
Well, you have to conform.

02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:28.960
You can't become a doctor without conforming.

02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:32.360
I just made it through.

02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:38.680
But there aren't many and it's hard work,

02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:42.480
but you have to conform.

02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.000
And even with my colleagues in my own practice,

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.760
I couldn't convince them that some of the beliefs they had

02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:51.520
about how best to practice weren't accurate.

02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:55.520
There's one scene, a younger physician

02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:57.960
had prescribed hormone replacement therapy.

02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:00.400
This is back in 2000, 2001,

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:02.640
had prescribed hormone replacement therapy

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:04.360
for one of my patients

02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:07.120
who happened to be a really good personal friend.

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:12.120
And I saw that patient covering for my colleague

02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:15.680
at one point and I saw that her hormone replacement therapy

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:17.280
had been renewed.

02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:19.520
And I said, are you having hot flashes or any problem?

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:20.560
No, no, no, no.

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:25.120
But Dr. So-and-so said it's better for my health.

02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:26.680
And I said, no, it's not.

02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:28.440
The research is showing that it's not.

02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:31.280
It's harmful for your health and I think you should stop it.

02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.840
So my colleague approached me when she saw the chart

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:38.080
and said, wait a minute, that's my patient.

02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:40.520
Maybe your friend, but it's my patient.

02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:45.520
And I went to a conference from my alma mater,

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.080
medical school, and they said that healthy people

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.040
should be given hormone replacement.

02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:55.240
And I said, there's gotta be drug companies involved in this.

02:10:55.240 --> 02:10:56.320
And she said, no, no, no.

02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:57.680
It was at my university.

02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:59.880
It was not a drug company thing.

02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:02.320
We didn't go to a Caribbean Island.

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:03.880
I said, do you have the syllabus?

02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:04.960
She said, yeah.

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.680
And she went and got the syllabus

02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:09.480
and sure enough, it was sponsored by a drug company.

02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:11.320
They're everywhere.

02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:12.160
They're everywhere.

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:16.280
And it's back to Kuhn that groups of experts

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:19.760
share unspoken assumptions.

02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:22.760
And in order to be included in that group of experts,

02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:25.040
you have to share those unspoken assumptions.

02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.800
And what I'm hoping to do with my book, Sickening,

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:31.800
and being here, having this wonderful conversation with you

02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:36.160
is to create an alternative to this normal

02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:41.160
that people can pursue and practice better medicine

02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:44.080
and also prevent burnout.

02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:46.240
I mean, about half the doctors complain

02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:48.080
that they're burned out and they've had it.

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:50.960
And I think that this is a subject,

02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:52.080
but I don't have data on this.

02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:53.560
This is just my opinion.

02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.800
But I think that a lot of that burnout

02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:01.320
is so-called moral injury from practicing in a way

02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:05.320
that the docs know isn't working.

02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.680
It's not actually providing an alternative

02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:09.880
to the normal that people can pursue.

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:13.040
Alternative to the normal is expanding the normal,

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:14.920
is shifting the normal, just like with Kuhn.

02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:19.440
I mean, you're basically looking for to shift

02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:24.040
the way medicine is done to the original,

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:27.120
I mean, to the intent that it represents

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:30.600
that the ideal of medicine, of healthcare.

02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:33.520
Yeah, in Kuhnian terms, to have a revolution.

02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:36.880
And that revolution would be to practice medicine

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.720
in a way that will be epidemiologically most effective,

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:45.320
not most profitable for the people who are providing you

02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.400
with what's called knowledge.

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:51.400
You helped a lot of people as a doctor, as an educator,

02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:56.560
live better lives, live longer,

02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:59.160
but you yourself are a mortal being.

02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:02.240
Do you think about your own mortality?

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:03.640
Do you think about your death?

02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:04.800
Are you afraid of death?

02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:07.640
I'm not, I've faced it.

02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:11.920
I've been close.

02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:12.760
Yourself?

02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.200
How do you think about it?

02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:19.280
What wisdom do you gain from having come close to death

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:21.840
and the fact that the whole thing ends?

02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:24.080
It's liberating.

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:26.640
It's very liberating.

02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:27.480
I mean, I'm serious.

02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:30.920
I was close and not too long ago.

02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:36.640
And it was a sense of, you know,

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:41.760
this may be the way it ends.

02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:45.800
And I've done my best.

02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:47.040
It's not been perfect.

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.200
And if it ends here, it ends here.

02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:54.440
The people around me are trying to do their best.

02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:57.920
And in fact, I got pulled out of it,

02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:00.720
but it didn't look like I was gonna get pulled out of it.

02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:06.200
Are you ultimately grateful for the ride,

02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:07.440
even though it ends?

02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:12.440
Well, it's a little, I think so.

02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:15.680
If I know, you know, you can't take the ride

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.680
if you know what the, it's gonna end well.

02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:19.960
It's not the real ride.

02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:21.000
It's just a ride.

02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:25.200
But I, having gone through the whole thing,

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:30.200
I definitely freed me of a sense of anxiety about death.

02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:35.560
And it said to me, do your best every day,

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:37.240
because it's gonna end sometime.

02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.800
I apologize for the ridiculously big question,

02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.720
but what do you think is the meaning of life,

02:14:45.720 --> 02:14:47.560
of our human existence?

02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:54.640
I think it's to care about something

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:55.880
and do your best with it.

02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.920
Whether it's being a doctor

02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:03.160
and trying to make sure that the greatest number of people

02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:04.520
get the best healthcare,

02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:08.160
or it's a gardener who wants to have

02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:09.360
the most beautiful plants,

02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:11.480
or it's a grandparent who wants to have

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:13.720
a good relationship with their grandchildren.

02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.720
But whatever it is that gives you a sense of meaning,

02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:21.880
as long as it doesn't hurt other people,

02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:24.960
to really commit yourself to it.

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:27.920
That commitment, being in that commitment for me

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:29.880
is the meaning of life.

02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.040
Put your whole heart and soul into the thing.

02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:35.400
What is it?

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:37.560
The Bukowski poem, Go All the Way.

02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:41.520
John, you're an incredible human being,

02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:42.520
incredible educator.

02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:45.440
Like I said, I recommend people listen to your lectures.

02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:48.000
It's so refreshing to see that clarity

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.360
of thought and brilliance.

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:51.880
And obviously your criticism of Big Pharma

02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:56.480
or your illumination of the mechanisms of Big Pharma

02:15:56.840 --> 02:15:58.400
is really important at this time.

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:02.360
So I really hope people read your book,

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:03.920
Sickening, that's out today,

02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:05.760
or depending on when this comes out.

02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:09.120
Thank you so much for spending

02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:12.240
your extremely valuable time with me today.

02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:13.080
It was amazing.

02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.520
Well, Lex, I wanted back to you.

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:18.720
Thanks for engaging in this conversation,

02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:21.440
for creating the space to have it

02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.160
and creating a listenership that is interested

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:27.400
in understanding serious ideas.

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.520
And I really appreciate the conversation.

02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:31.000
And I should mention that offline,

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.080
you told me you listened to the Gilbert Strang episode.

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:36.040
So for anyone who don't know Gilbert Strang,

02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:39.040
another epic human being that should check out.

02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.320
If you don't know anything about mathematics

02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.400
or linear algebra, go look him up.

02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:46.720
He's one of the great mathematics educators of all time.

02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:49.080
So of all the people you mentioned to me,

02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:50.840
I appreciate that you mentioned him

02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:54.120
because he is a rock star of mathematics.

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:56.240
John, thank you so much for talking to us, this was awesome.

02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:57.080
Great, thank you.

02:16:57.920 --> 02:16:59.400
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:00.800
with John Abramson.

02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:02.200

And now let me leave you some words from Marcus Aurelius.

02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:14.800
Waste no time arguing about what a good man should be.

02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:15.680
Be one.

02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:19.920
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:24.960
Thank you.
