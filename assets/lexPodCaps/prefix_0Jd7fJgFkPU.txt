00:00.000 --> 00:01.600
If you read a half hour a night,

00:01.600 --> 00:03.480
the calculation I came to is that you can read

00:03.480 --> 00:05.160
a thousand books in 50 years.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.120
All of the components are there

00:07.120 --> 00:09.440
to engineer intimate experiences.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.520
Extraterrestrial life is a true mystery,

00:11.520 --> 00:13.320
the most tantalizing mystery of all.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.840
How many humans need to disappear

00:15.840 --> 00:17.620
for us to be completely lost?

00:19.800 --> 00:22.280
The following is a conversation with Tim Urban,

00:22.280 --> 00:25.440
author and illustrator of the amazing blog

00:25.440 --> 00:28.000
called Wait, But Why.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.120
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.240
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:32.240 --> 00:33.360
in the description.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.320
And now, dear friends, here's Tim Urban.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.200
You wrote a Wait, But Why blog post

00:41.200 --> 00:42.720
about the big and the small,

00:42.720 --> 00:45.680
from the observable universe to the atom.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.520
What world do you find most mysterious or beautiful,

00:48.520 --> 00:50.680
the very big or the very small?

00:50.680 --> 00:54.120
The very small seems a lot more mysterious.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.640
And I mean, the very big I feel like we kind of understand.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.120
I mean, not the very, very big, not the multiverse,

01:00.120 --> 01:01.760
if there is a multiverse,

01:01.760 --> 01:04.320
not anything outside of the observable universe.

01:05.320 --> 01:07.080
But the very small,

01:07.080 --> 01:09.600
I think we really have no idea what's going on,

01:09.600 --> 01:11.280
or very much less idea.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.680
But I find that, so I think the small is more mysterious,

01:13.680 --> 01:16.220
but I think the big is sexier.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.360
I just cannot get enough of the bigness of space

01:23.600 --> 01:26.340
and the farness of stars.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.260
And it just continually blows my mind.

01:29.260 --> 01:33.500
I mean, we still, the vastness of the observable universe

01:33.500 --> 01:35.820
has the mystery that we don't know what's out there.

01:35.820 --> 01:38.260
We know how it works, perhaps.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.900
Like, general relativity can tell us

01:40.900 --> 01:42.820
how the movement of bodies works,

01:42.820 --> 01:45.420
how they're born, all that kind of things.

01:45.420 --> 01:49.300
But like, how many civilizations are out there?

01:49.300 --> 01:51.460
How many, like, what are the weird things that are out there?

01:51.460 --> 01:53.660
Oh yeah, life, well, extraterrestrial life

01:53.660 --> 01:54.700
is a true mystery,

01:54.700 --> 01:56.720
the most tantalizing mystery of all.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.100
But that's like our size.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.660
So that's maybe it's that the actual,

02:02.660 --> 02:04.100
the big and the small are really cool,

02:04.100 --> 02:06.460
but it's actually the things that are potentially our size

02:06.460 --> 02:07.740
that are the most tantalizing.

02:07.740 --> 02:10.140
Potentially our size is probably the key word.

02:10.140 --> 02:13.420
Yeah, I mean, I wonder how small intelligent life could get.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.400
Probably not that small.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.340
And I assume that there's a limit that you're not gonna,

02:18.340 --> 02:19.940
I mean, you might have like a whale,

02:19.940 --> 02:21.860
blue whale size intelligent being,

02:21.860 --> 02:23.340
that would be kind of cool.

02:23.340 --> 02:27.140
But I feel like we're in the range of order of magnitude,

02:27.140 --> 02:29.620
smaller and bigger than us for life, but maybe not.

02:29.620 --> 02:32.220
Maybe you could have some giant life form.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.020
Just seems like, I don't know,

02:34.020 --> 02:36.660
there's gotta be some reason that anything intelligent

02:36.660 --> 02:40.700
between kind of like a little tiny rodent or finger monkey

02:40.700 --> 02:43.660
up to a blue whale on this planet.

02:43.660 --> 02:46.460
I don't know, maybe when you change the gravity

02:46.460 --> 02:47.740
and other things.

02:47.740 --> 02:49.140
Well, you could think of life

02:49.140 --> 02:52.540
as a thing of self-assembling organisms

02:52.540 --> 02:54.340
and they just get bigger and bigger and bigger.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.940
There's no such thing as a human being.

02:55.940 --> 02:58.820
A human being is made up of a bunch of tiny organisms

02:58.820 --> 03:00.100
that are working together.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.020
And we somehow envision that as one entity

03:03.020 --> 03:04.540
because it has consciousness.

03:04.540 --> 03:08.060
But maybe it's just organisms on top of organisms.

03:08.060 --> 03:10.580
Organisms all the way down, turtles all the way down.

03:10.580 --> 03:14.140
So like earth can be seen as an organism for people,

03:14.140 --> 03:17.380
for alien species that is very different.

03:18.260 --> 03:21.500
Like why is the human the fundamental entity

03:21.500 --> 03:23.580
that is living?

03:23.580 --> 03:26.140
And then everything else is just either a collection

03:26.140 --> 03:28.580
of humans or components of humans.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.420
I think if it kind of is, if you think about,

03:30.420 --> 03:32.660
I think of like an emergence elevator.

03:32.660 --> 03:36.780
And so you've got an ant is on one floor

03:36.780 --> 03:39.620
and then the ant colony is a floor above.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.300
Or maybe there's even units within the colony

03:41.300 --> 03:42.900
that's one floor above and the full colony

03:42.900 --> 03:44.660
is two floors above.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.980
And to me, I think that it's the colony

03:46.980 --> 03:49.420
that is closest to being the animal.

03:49.420 --> 03:53.940
It's like the individual thing that competes with others

03:53.940 --> 03:57.660
while the individual ants are like cells

03:57.660 --> 03:59.060
in the animal's body.

03:59.060 --> 04:01.340
We are more like a colony in that regard.

04:01.340 --> 04:04.700
But the humans are weird because we kind of,

04:04.700 --> 04:08.260
I think of it, if emergence happens in an emergence tower

04:08.260 --> 04:10.860
where you've got kind of, as I said, cells and then humans

04:10.860 --> 04:15.100
and communities and societies, ants are very specific.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.940
The individual ants are always cooperating

04:17.900 --> 04:19.260
with each other for the sake of the colony.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.740
So the colony is this unit that is the competitive unit.

04:22.740 --> 04:25.860
Humans can kind of go, we take the elevator up and down

04:25.860 --> 04:27.260
emergence tower psychologically.

04:27.260 --> 04:30.940
Sometimes we are individuals that are competing

04:30.940 --> 04:33.180
with other individuals and that's where our mindset is.

04:33.180 --> 04:35.900
And then other times we get in this crazy zone,

04:35.900 --> 04:39.620
a protest or a sporting event and you're just chanting

04:39.620 --> 04:41.300
and screaming and doing the same hand motions

04:41.300 --> 04:43.820
with all these other people and you feel like one.

04:43.820 --> 04:45.740
You feel like one and you'd sacrifice yourself.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.900
No, that's what, you know, soldiers and so our brains

04:48.900 --> 04:51.700
can kind of psychologically go up and down this elevator

04:51.700 --> 04:53.580
in an interesting way.

04:53.580 --> 04:56.100
Yeah, I wonder how much of that is just the narrative

04:56.100 --> 04:57.100
we tell ourselves.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.060
Maybe we are just like an ant colony.

04:59.060 --> 05:02.420
We're just collaborating always, even in our stories

05:02.420 --> 05:05.820
of individualism, of like the freedom of the individual,

05:05.820 --> 05:10.700
like this kind of isolation, lone man on an island

05:10.700 --> 05:11.540
kind of thing.

05:11.540 --> 05:13.820
We're actually all part of this giant network

05:13.820 --> 05:17.580
of maybe one of the things that makes humans who we are

05:17.580 --> 05:22.580
is probably deeply social, the ability to maintain

05:22.620 --> 05:24.500
not just the single human intelligence

05:24.500 --> 05:26.580
but like a collective intelligence.

05:26.580 --> 05:30.700
And so this feeling like individual is just cause we woke up

05:30.700 --> 05:33.140
at this level of the hierarchy.

05:33.140 --> 05:38.100
So we make it special but we very well could be just part

05:38.100 --> 05:39.820
of the ant colony.

05:39.820 --> 05:42.100
This whole conversation, I'm either going to be doing

05:42.100 --> 05:46.500
a Shakespearean analysis of your Twitter, your writing

05:46.500 --> 05:49.620
or very specific statements that you've made.

05:49.620 --> 05:54.620
So you've written answers to a mail back of questions.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.100
The questions were amazing, the ones you've chosen

05:57.100 --> 05:58.660
and your answers were amazing.

05:58.660 --> 06:01.140
So on this topic of the big and the small, somebody asked,

06:01.140 --> 06:05.020
are we bigger than we are small or smaller than we are big?

06:05.020 --> 06:06.460
Who's asking these questions?

06:06.460 --> 06:08.020
This is really good.

06:08.020 --> 06:09.180
You have amazing fans.

06:09.180 --> 06:14.180
Okay, so where do we sit at this level

06:15.820 --> 06:18.500
of the very small to the very big?

06:18.500 --> 06:20.060
So are we bigger or are we small?

06:20.060 --> 06:21.580
Are we bigger than we are small?

06:21.580 --> 06:23.860
I think it depends on what we're asking here.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.780
So if we're talking about the biggest thing

06:26.780 --> 06:31.780
that we kind of can talk about without just imagining

06:31.860 --> 06:34.340
is the observable universe, the Hubble sphere.

06:35.340 --> 06:40.340
And that's about 10 to the 26th meters in diameter.

06:41.780 --> 06:44.460
The smallest thing we talk about is a plank length,

06:44.460 --> 06:47.220
but you could argue that that's kind of an imaginary thing,

06:47.220 --> 06:49.460
but that's 10 to the negative 35.

06:49.460 --> 06:52.540
Now we're about, conveniently about 10 to the one,

06:52.540 --> 06:53.820
not quite, 10 to the zero.

06:53.820 --> 06:56.900
We're about 10 to the zero meters long.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.900
So we're writing, so it's easy because you can just look

06:58.900 --> 07:03.540
and say, okay, well, for example, atoms are like 10

07:03.540 --> 07:06.980
to the negative 15th or 10 to the negative 16th meters

07:06.980 --> 07:08.540
across, right?

07:08.540 --> 07:10.580
If you go 10 to the 15th or 10 to the 16th,

07:10.580 --> 07:13.820
which is right, that's now so an atom to us is us to this,

07:13.820 --> 07:16.660
you get to like nebulas, smaller than a galaxy

07:16.660 --> 07:18.500
and bigger than the biggest star.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.740
So we're right in between a nebula and an atom.

07:22.740 --> 07:24.100
Now, if you wanna go down to quark level,

07:24.100 --> 07:26.300
you might be able to get up to galaxy level.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.260
When you go up to the observable universe,

07:29.260 --> 07:31.980
you're getting down on the small side to things

07:31.980 --> 07:36.100
that we, I think, are mostly theoretically imagining

07:36.100 --> 07:39.740
are there and hypothesizing are there.

07:39.740 --> 07:43.340
So I think as far as real world objects

07:43.340 --> 07:45.260
that we really know a lot about,

07:45.260 --> 07:48.780
I would say we are smaller than we are big.

07:48.780 --> 07:50.300
But if you wanna go down to the plank length,

07:50.300 --> 07:52.540
we're very quickly, we're bigger than we are small.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.020
If you think about strings.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.580
Yeah, string, exactly, string theory and so on.

07:57.580 --> 07:58.540
That's interesting.

07:58.540 --> 08:00.740
But I think like you answered, no matter what,

08:00.780 --> 08:02.020
we're kind of middle-ish.

08:02.020 --> 08:04.580
Yeah, I mean, here's something cool.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.820
If a human is a neutrino, and again, neutrino,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.540
the size doesn't really make sense.

08:08.540 --> 08:09.660
It's not really a size.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.660
But when we talk about some of these neutrinos,

08:11.660 --> 08:15.500
I mean, if a neutrino is a human, a proton is the sun.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.660
So that's like, I mean, a proton is real small,

08:18.660 --> 08:19.740
like really small.

08:22.300 --> 08:26.500
And so, yeah, the small gets like crazy small very quickly.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.380
Let's talk about aliens.

08:30.380 --> 08:31.580
We already mentioned it.

08:32.740 --> 08:34.140
Let's start just by with the basic.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.980
What's your intuition as of today?

08:35.980 --> 08:38.340
This is a thing that could change day by day.

08:38.340 --> 08:40.860
But how many alien civilizations out there?

08:40.860 --> 08:42.300
Is it zero?

08:42.300 --> 08:45.140
Is it a handful?

08:45.140 --> 08:46.500
Is it almost endless?

08:46.500 --> 08:50.220
Like the observable universe

08:50.220 --> 08:52.180
or the universe is teeming with life?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.300
If I had a gun to my head, I have to take a guess.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.900
I would say it's teeming with life.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.140
I would say there is.

08:59.140 --> 09:02.340
I think running a Monte Carlo simulation,

09:02.340 --> 09:05.580
this paper by Anders Sandberg and Drexler

09:05.580 --> 09:07.300
and a few others a couple of years ago,

09:07.300 --> 09:08.780
I think you probably know about it.

09:08.780 --> 09:11.900
I think the mean,

09:13.780 --> 09:15.060
you know, using different,

09:16.660 --> 09:17.780
using different, you know,

09:17.780 --> 09:21.780
running through randomized Drake equation multiplication,

09:21.780 --> 09:25.060
you ended up with 27 million as the mean

09:25.060 --> 09:27.660
of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy,

09:28.500 --> 09:29.740
in the Milky Way alone.

09:30.940 --> 09:32.420
And so then if you go outside the Milky Way,

09:32.420 --> 09:33.900
that would turn into trillions.

09:33.900 --> 09:36.020
That's the mean.

09:36.020 --> 09:38.780
Now what's interesting is that there's a long tail

09:38.780 --> 09:41.700
because they believe some of these multipliers

09:41.700 --> 09:42.540
in the Drake equation.

09:42.540 --> 09:47.420
So for example, the probability that life starts

09:47.420 --> 09:51.580
in the first place, they think that the kind of range

09:51.580 --> 09:55.980
that we use is for that variable or is way too small.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.740
It's constraining our possibilities.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.740
And if you actually extend it to, you know,

10:00.740 --> 10:03.420
some crazy number of orders of magnitude,

10:03.420 --> 10:06.540
like 200, they think that variable should be,

10:07.900 --> 10:09.700
you get this long tail where,

10:09.700 --> 10:10.780
I forget the exact number,

10:10.780 --> 10:12.620
but it's like a third or a quarter

10:12.620 --> 10:15.820
of the total outcomes have us alone.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.220
Like, you know, I think it's like,

10:17.220 --> 10:19.940
I think it's a sizable percentage has us

10:19.940 --> 10:23.180
as the only intelligent life in the galaxy,

10:23.180 --> 10:24.020
but you can keep going.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.580
I think there's like, you know,

10:25.580 --> 10:29.060
a non-zero like legitimate amount of outcomes there

10:29.060 --> 10:32.420
that have us as the only life in the observable universe

10:32.420 --> 10:33.500
at all is on earth.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.260
I mean, seems incredibly counterintuitive.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.860
It seems like, you know, you mentioned that people think,

10:38.860 --> 10:41.540
you're, you know, you must be an idiot because, you know,

10:41.540 --> 10:43.260
if you picked up one grain of sand on a beach

10:43.260 --> 10:45.940
and examined it and you found all these little things on it,

10:45.940 --> 10:46.780
it's like saying, well,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.580
maybe this is the only one that has that.

10:48.580 --> 10:49.980
And it's like, probably not.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.820
They're probably most of the sand probably,

10:51.820 --> 10:53.380
you're a lot of the sand, right?

10:53.380 --> 10:55.660
So, and then the other hand, we don't see anything.

10:55.660 --> 10:56.980
We don't see any evidence, you know,

10:56.980 --> 10:59.220
which of course people would say that the people

10:59.220 --> 11:02.980
who scoff at the concept that we're potentially alone,

11:04.460 --> 11:06.580
they say, well, of course there's lots of reasons

11:06.580 --> 11:07.780
we wouldn't have seen anything.

11:07.780 --> 11:11.180
And they can go list them and they're very compelling,

11:11.180 --> 11:13.020
but we don't know.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.340
And the truth is, if this were a freak thing,

11:15.340 --> 11:17.940
I mean, if this were a completely freak thing

11:17.940 --> 11:20.020
that happened here, whether it's life at all

11:20.020 --> 11:22.180
or just getting to this level intelligence,

11:24.180 --> 11:26.820
that species, whoever it was would think

11:26.820 --> 11:29.420
there must be lots of us out there and they'd be wrong.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.860
So just being, again, using the same intuition

11:31.860 --> 11:32.860
that most people would use,

11:32.860 --> 11:35.500
I'd say there's probably lots of other things out there.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.700
Yeah, and you wrote a great blog post about it,

11:37.700 --> 11:41.620
but to me, the two interesting reasons

11:41.620 --> 11:43.420
that we haven't been in contact,

11:43.420 --> 11:47.620
I too have intuition that the universe is teaming on life.

11:47.620 --> 11:50.740
So one interesting is around the great filter.

11:50.740 --> 11:55.220
So the great filter is either behind us or in front of us.

11:55.220 --> 11:58.460
So the reason that's interesting is you get to think about

11:58.460 --> 12:03.460
what kind of things ensure the survival

12:04.060 --> 12:05.900
of an intelligent civilization

12:05.900 --> 12:08.460
or lead to the destruction of intelligent civilization.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.540
That's a very pragmatic, very important question

12:10.540 --> 12:13.380
to always be asking, and we'll talk about some of those.

12:13.380 --> 12:18.380
And then the other one is I'm saddened by the possibility

12:18.500 --> 12:20.620
that there could be aliens communicate with us

12:20.620 --> 12:21.660
all the time.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.700
In fact, they may have visited.

12:25.140 --> 12:29.620
And we're just too dumb to hear it, to see it.

12:29.620 --> 12:34.540
Like the idea that the kind of life that can evolve

12:34.540 --> 12:38.140
is just the range of life that can evolve is so large

12:38.140 --> 12:41.500
that our narrow view of what is life

12:41.500 --> 12:43.700
and what is intelligent life is preventing us

12:43.700 --> 12:45.780
from having communication with them.

12:45.780 --> 12:47.740
But then they don't seem very smart

12:47.740 --> 12:50.380
because if they were trying to communicate with us,

12:51.380 --> 12:53.420
if they were super intelligent,

12:53.420 --> 12:56.420
they would be very, I'm sure if there's lots of life,

12:56.420 --> 12:59.340
we're not that rare, we're not some crazy weird species

12:59.340 --> 13:01.940
that hears and has different kinds of ways

13:01.940 --> 13:04.660
of perceiving signals.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.980
So they would probably be able to,

13:06.980 --> 13:08.140
if you really wanted to communicate

13:08.140 --> 13:11.220
with an earth-like species, with a human-like species,

13:12.100 --> 13:14.140
you would send out all kinds of things.

13:14.140 --> 13:19.140
You'd send out radio waves and you send out gravity waves.

13:19.380 --> 13:20.740
And lots of things.

13:20.740 --> 13:22.180
So if they're communicating in a way,

13:22.180 --> 13:23.940
they're trying to communicate with us.

13:23.940 --> 13:26.020
And it's just we're too dumb to perceive the signals.

13:26.020 --> 13:28.420
It's like, well, they're not doing a great job

13:28.420 --> 13:32.820
of considering the primitive species we might be.

13:32.820 --> 13:35.860
So I don't know, I think if a super intelligent species

13:35.860 --> 13:40.860
wanted to get in touch with us and had the capability of,

13:40.900 --> 13:43.620
I think probably they would.

13:43.620 --> 13:48.620
Well, they may be getting in touch with us.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.140
They're just getting in touch with the thing

13:50.140 --> 13:52.300
that we humans are not understanding

13:52.300 --> 13:53.820
that they're getting in touch with us with.

13:53.820 --> 13:56.020
I guess that's what I was trying to say is

13:56.020 --> 13:57.580
there could be something about earth

13:57.580 --> 14:00.260
that's much more special than us humans.

14:00.260 --> 14:03.540
Like the nature of the intelligence that's on earth

14:03.540 --> 14:07.620
or the thing that's of value and that's curious

14:07.620 --> 14:10.660
and that's complicated and fascinating and beautiful

14:10.660 --> 14:15.300
might be something that's not just like tweets, okay?

14:15.300 --> 14:17.220
Like English language that's interpretable

14:17.220 --> 14:19.700
or any kind of language or any kind of signal,

14:19.700 --> 14:22.340
whether it's gravity or radio signal

14:22.340 --> 14:24.940
that humans seem to appreciate.

14:24.940 --> 14:27.540
What, why not the actual,

14:27.540 --> 14:29.540
it could be the process of evolution itself.

14:29.540 --> 14:31.100
There could be something about the way

14:31.100 --> 14:33.300
that earth is breathing essentially

14:33.300 --> 14:34.660
through the creation of life

14:34.660 --> 14:37.340
and this complex growth of life.

14:37.340 --> 14:40.420
There's like, it's a whole different way

14:40.420 --> 14:42.940
to view organisms and view life

14:42.940 --> 14:44.940
that could be getting communicated with.

14:44.980 --> 14:47.180
And we humans are just a tiny fingertip

14:47.180 --> 14:49.020
on top of that intelligence

14:49.020 --> 14:50.620
and the communication is happening

14:50.620 --> 14:55.500
with the main mothership of earth versus us humans

14:55.500 --> 14:58.660
that seem to treat ourselves as super important

14:58.660 --> 15:00.540
and we're missing the big picture.

15:00.540 --> 15:02.140
I mean, it sounds crazy,

15:02.140 --> 15:04.740
but our understanding of what is intelligent,

15:04.740 --> 15:08.060
of what is life, what is consciousness is very limited.

15:08.060 --> 15:11.860
And it seems to be, and just being very suspicious,

15:11.860 --> 15:14.420
it seems to be awfully human-centric.

15:15.140 --> 15:17.900
This story, it seems like the progress of science

15:17.900 --> 15:22.900
is constantly putting humans down on the importance,

15:25.860 --> 15:28.260
like on the cosmic importance,

15:28.260 --> 15:32.100
the ranking of how big we are, how important we are.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.980
That seems to be the more we discover

15:33.980 --> 15:34.900
that's what's happening.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.300
And I think science is very young.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.860
And so I think eventually we might figure out

15:39.860 --> 15:41.900
that there's something much, much bigger going on,

15:41.900 --> 15:45.060
that humans are just a curious little side effect

15:45.060 --> 15:46.420
of the much bigger thing.

15:46.420 --> 15:49.300
That's what, I mean, that, as I'm saying,

15:49.300 --> 15:50.660
it just sounds insane, but.

15:50.660 --> 15:54.260
Well, it just, it sounds a little like religious.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.700
It sounds like a spiritual.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.980
It gets to that realm where there's something

15:59.980 --> 16:01.980
that more than meets the eye.

16:01.980 --> 16:06.980
Well, yeah, but not, so religious and spiritual

16:07.580 --> 16:11.100
often have this kind of woo-woo characteristic,

16:11.740 --> 16:12.940
and people write books about them,

16:12.940 --> 16:14.980
then go to wars over whatever the heck is written

16:14.980 --> 16:16.180
in those books.

16:16.180 --> 16:19.860
I mean, more like it's possible that collective intelligence

16:19.860 --> 16:22.340
is more important than individual intelligence, right?

16:22.340 --> 16:23.500
It's the ant colony.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.860
What's the primal organism?

16:24.860 --> 16:26.940
Is it the ant colony or is it the ant?

16:26.940 --> 16:29.620
Yeah, I mean, humans, just like any individual ant

16:29.620 --> 16:32.100
can't do shit, but the colony can do these,

16:32.100 --> 16:33.380
make these incredible structures

16:33.380 --> 16:35.420
and has this intelligence.

16:35.420 --> 16:36.860
And we're exactly the same.

16:36.860 --> 16:39.460
I mean, you know the famous thing

16:39.700 --> 16:42.420
that no one, no human knows how to make a pencil.

16:43.540 --> 16:44.620
Have you heard this?

16:44.620 --> 16:45.460
No.

16:45.460 --> 16:46.300
Basically, I mean.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.340
This is great.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.620
There's not, a single human out there

16:49.620 --> 16:51.620
has absolutely no idea how to make a pencil.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.980
So you have to think about, you have to get the wood.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.140
That the paint, the different chemicals

16:56.140 --> 16:57.620
that make up the yellow paint,

16:57.620 --> 16:59.420
the eraser is a whole other thing.

16:59.420 --> 17:01.380
The metal has to be mined from somewhere

17:01.380 --> 17:04.620
and then the graphite, whatever that is.

17:04.620 --> 17:06.100
And there's not one person on earth

17:06.100 --> 17:10.020
who knows how to kind of collect all those materials

17:10.020 --> 17:11.140
and create a pencil.

17:11.140 --> 17:14.100
But together, that's one of the, that's child's play.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.260
It's just one of the easiest things.

17:15.260 --> 17:18.500
So, you know, the other thing I like to think about,

17:18.500 --> 17:21.060
I actually put this as a question on the blog once.

17:22.340 --> 17:23.820
There's a thought experiment

17:24.780 --> 17:25.940
and I actually wanna hear what you think.

17:25.940 --> 17:30.740
So if a witch, kind of a dickish witch comes around

17:30.740 --> 17:34.980
and she says, I'm gonna cast a spell on all of humanity

17:34.980 --> 17:39.340
and all material things that you've invented

17:39.340 --> 17:41.340
are gonna disappear all at once.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.940
So suddenly we're all standing there naked.

17:42.940 --> 17:44.460
There's no buildings.

17:44.460 --> 17:47.380
There's no cars and boats and ships

17:47.380 --> 17:49.860
and no mines, nothing, right?

17:49.860 --> 17:52.940
It's just the stone age earth and a bunch of naked humans.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.380
But we're all the same, we have the same brain.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.860
So we all know what's going on.

17:55.860 --> 17:57.060
And we all got a note from her.

17:57.060 --> 17:59.420
So we understand the deal and she says,

17:59.420 --> 18:01.580
she communicated to every human, here's the deal.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.900
You lost all your stuff.

18:03.900 --> 18:07.220
You guys need to make one working iPhone 13.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.420
And you make one working iPhone 13

18:09.420 --> 18:11.620
that could pass in the Apple store today,

18:11.620 --> 18:13.780
you know, in your previous world.

18:13.780 --> 18:16.340
For an iPhone 13, then I will restore everything.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.260
How long do you think?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.980
And so everyone knows, this is the mission.

18:18.980 --> 18:22.580
We're all aware of the mission, everyone, all humans.

18:22.580 --> 18:23.700
How long would it take us?

18:23.700 --> 18:25.140
That's a really interesting question.

18:25.140 --> 18:27.900
So obviously if you do a random selection

18:27.900 --> 18:31.180
of hundred or a thousand humans within the population,

18:31.180 --> 18:34.660
I think you're screwed to make that iPhone.

18:34.660 --> 18:39.460
I tend to believe that there's fascinating specialization

18:39.460 --> 18:40.780
among the human civilization.

18:40.780 --> 18:43.100
Like there's a few hackers out there

18:43.100 --> 18:45.660
that can like solo build an iPhone.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.460
But with what materials?

18:48.460 --> 18:50.300
So no materials whatsoever.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.860
It has to, I mean, it's virtually, I mean, okay.

18:54.860 --> 18:56.460
You have to build factories.

18:56.460 --> 18:59.020
I mean, to fabricate.

18:59.020 --> 18:59.860
Okay.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.140
Okay.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.340
And how are you gonna mine them?

19:03.340 --> 19:04.420
You know, you gotta mine the materials

19:04.420 --> 19:05.500
where you don't have any cranes.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.740
You don't have any, you know.

19:06.740 --> 19:10.820
Okay, you 100% have to have the, everybody's naked?

19:10.820 --> 19:12.340
Everyone's naked and everyone's where they are.

19:12.340 --> 19:14.820
So you and I would currently be naked on the ground

19:14.820 --> 19:16.300
in what used to be Manhattan.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.140
So no buildings.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.580
No grassy island.

19:18.580 --> 19:19.420
Yeah.

19:19.420 --> 19:22.140
So you need a naked Elon Musk type character

19:22.140 --> 19:23.860
to then start building a company.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.620
You have to have a large company then.

19:25.620 --> 19:26.460
Right.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.220
He doesn't even know where he, you know, where is everyone?

19:28.300 --> 19:30.300
Oh shit, how am I gonna find other people I need to talk to?

19:30.300 --> 19:31.940
But we have all the knowledge of.

19:31.940 --> 19:32.980
Yeah, everyone has the knowledge

19:32.980 --> 19:34.020
that's in their current brains.

19:34.020 --> 19:34.860
Yeah.

19:34.860 --> 19:38.380
I've met some legit engineers.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.740
Crazy polymath people.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.820
Yeah, but the actual labor of,

19:42.820 --> 19:47.180
cause you said, cause like the original Mac,

19:47.180 --> 19:50.460
like the Apple II, that can be built.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.460
But.

19:51.460 --> 19:52.300
Even that, you know.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.140
Even that's gonna be tough.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.220
Well, I think part of it is a communication problem.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.860
If you could suddenly have, you know, someone,

19:56.900 --> 19:58.820
if everyone had a walkie talkie and there was, you know,

19:58.820 --> 20:00.900
a couple, you know, 10 really smart people

20:00.900 --> 20:02.260
who are designated the leaders, they could say,

20:02.260 --> 20:04.140
okay, I want, you know, everyone who can do this

20:04.140 --> 20:07.380
to walk west, you know, until you get to this little hub

20:07.380 --> 20:08.380
and everyone else, you know,

20:08.380 --> 20:10.180
and they could actually coordinate,

20:10.180 --> 20:11.060
but we don't have that.

20:11.060 --> 20:12.220
So it's like people just, you know,

20:12.220 --> 20:14.020
and then what I think about is,

20:14.020 --> 20:15.940
so you've got some people that are like trying to organize

20:15.940 --> 20:17.100
and you'll have a little community

20:17.100 --> 20:18.580
where a couple hundred people have come together

20:18.580 --> 20:20.100
and maybe a couple thousand have organized

20:20.100 --> 20:22.300
and they designated one person, you know, as the leader

20:22.300 --> 20:24.300
and then they have sub leaders and okay,

20:24.300 --> 20:25.140
we have a start here.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.300
We have some organization.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.860
You're also going to have some people that say, good,

20:28.860 --> 20:31.540
humans were a scourge upon the earth and this is good

20:31.540 --> 20:32.540
and they're going to try to sabotage.

20:32.540 --> 20:33.820
They're going to try to murder the people with the,

20:33.820 --> 20:35.780
and who know what they're talking about.

20:37.780 --> 20:40.900
The elite that possessed the knowledge.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.900
Well, and so everyone, maybe everyone's hopeful for the,

20:42.900 --> 20:44.340
you know, we're all civilized and hopeful

20:44.340 --> 20:45.740
for the first 30 days or something.

20:45.740 --> 20:47.140
And then things start to fall off.

20:47.140 --> 20:48.740
They, you know, people get, start to lose hope

20:48.740 --> 20:50.260
and there's new kinds of, you know,

20:50.260 --> 20:52.180
new kinds of governments popping up, you know,

20:52.180 --> 20:55.980
new kinds of societies and they're, you know,

20:56.420 --> 20:57.700
and they don't play nicely with the other ones.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.180
And, and I think very quickly,

20:59.180 --> 21:00.460
I think a lot of people will just give up and say,

21:00.460 --> 21:01.300
you know what, this is it.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.140
We're back in the stone age.

21:02.140 --> 21:03.820
Let's just create, you know, agrarian.

21:03.820 --> 21:05.020
We don't also don't know how to farm.

21:05.020 --> 21:06.060
No one knows how to farm.

21:06.060 --> 21:08.500
There's like, even the, even the farmers, you know,

21:08.500 --> 21:11.060
a lot of them are relying on their machines.

21:11.060 --> 21:14.700
And so we also are going to be a mass starvation.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.420
And that, you know, when you're trying to organize,

21:16.420 --> 21:18.740
a lot of people are, you know, coming in with, you know,

21:18.740 --> 21:21.860
spears they fashioned and trying to murder everyone

21:21.860 --> 21:22.700
who has food.

21:22.700 --> 21:23.540
It's an interesting question.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.620
Given today's society, how much violence would that be?

21:25.620 --> 21:27.980
We've gotten softer, less violent.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.060
And we don't have weapons.

21:29.060 --> 21:29.900
So we don't have weapons.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.740
We have really primitive weapons now.

21:31.740 --> 21:33.980
But we have, and also we have a kind of ethics

21:33.980 --> 21:35.660
where murder is bad.

21:35.660 --> 21:38.940
We used to be less, like human life was less valued

21:38.940 --> 21:39.780
in the past.

21:39.780 --> 21:41.940
So murder was more okay, like ethically.

21:41.940 --> 21:44.340
But in the past, they also were really good

21:44.340 --> 21:46.340
at figuring out how to have sustenance.

21:46.340 --> 21:48.700
They knew how to get food and water because they,

21:48.700 --> 21:49.820
so we have no idea.

21:49.820 --> 21:52.020
Like the ancient hunter gatherer societies would laugh

21:52.020 --> 21:52.860
at what's going on here.

21:52.860 --> 21:54.300
They'd say, you guys know, you don't know what you're,

21:54.300 --> 21:55.460
none of you know what you're doing.

21:55.940 --> 21:59.340
And also the amount of people feeding this amount of people

21:59.340 --> 22:02.180
in a very, in a Stone Age civilization

22:02.180 --> 22:03.780
that's not gonna happen.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.940
So New York and San Francisco are screwed.

22:05.940 --> 22:07.820
Well, whoever's not near water is really screwed.

22:07.820 --> 22:08.660
So that's true.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.020
You're near a river, a freshwater river.

22:11.020 --> 22:12.420
Anyways, it's a very interesting question.

22:12.420 --> 22:14.420
And what it does, this and the pencil,

22:14.420 --> 22:19.220
it makes me feel so grateful and like excited about like,

22:19.220 --> 22:21.540
man, our civilization is so cool.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.700
And this is, talk about collective intelligence.

22:24.700 --> 22:28.020
Humans did not build any of this.

22:28.020 --> 22:30.420
It's collective human super,

22:30.420 --> 22:33.860
collective humans is a super intelligent, you know,

22:33.860 --> 22:37.220
being that is, that can do absolutely,

22:37.220 --> 22:38.620
especially over long periods of time,

22:38.620 --> 22:39.660
can do such magical things.

22:39.660 --> 22:41.300
And we just get to be born.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.980
When I go out, when I'm working and I'm hungry,

22:42.980 --> 22:46.340
I just go click, click, click, and like a salad's coming.

22:46.340 --> 22:47.180
The salad arrives.

22:47.180 --> 22:50.060
If you think about the incredible infrastructure

22:50.060 --> 22:52.100
that's in place for that, for that quickly,

22:52.340 --> 22:54.420
just the internet to, you know, the electricity,

22:54.420 --> 22:55.980
first of all, that's just powering the things, you know,

22:55.980 --> 22:58.020
how the, where the, the amount of structures

22:58.020 --> 23:00.700
that have to be created and for that electricity to be there.

23:00.700 --> 23:02.620
And then you've got the, of course the internet.

23:02.620 --> 23:05.580
And then you have this system where delivery drivers

23:05.580 --> 23:06.620
and they have, they're riding bikes

23:06.620 --> 23:07.660
that were made by someone else.

23:07.660 --> 23:09.140
And they're going to get the salad

23:09.140 --> 23:11.540
and all those ingredients came from all over the place.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.620
I mean, it's just, so I think it's like,

23:13.620 --> 23:15.420
I like thinking about these things

23:15.420 --> 23:19.260
because it makes me feel like just so grateful.

23:19.260 --> 23:21.340
I'm like, man, it would be so awful if we didn't have this

23:21.700 --> 23:22.780
and people who didn't have it would think

23:22.780 --> 23:25.260
this was such magic we live in and we do.

23:25.260 --> 23:27.580
And like, cool, that's fun.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.020
Yeah, one of the most amazing things when I showed up,

23:30.020 --> 23:32.220
I came here at 13 from the Soviet Union

23:32.220 --> 23:36.620
and the supermarket was, people don't really realize that,

23:36.620 --> 23:39.980
but the abundance of food, it's not even,

23:41.300 --> 23:43.460
so bananas was the thing I was obsessed about.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.820
I just ate bananas every day for many, many months

23:45.820 --> 23:47.780
because I haven't had bananas in Russia.

23:47.780 --> 23:49.860
And the fact that you can have as many bananas as you want,

23:49.860 --> 23:53.380
plus they were like somewhat inexpensive

23:53.380 --> 23:54.660
relative to the other food.

23:54.660 --> 23:58.100
And the fact that you can somehow have a system

23:58.100 --> 24:00.220
that brings bananas to you without having to wait

24:00.220 --> 24:03.260
in a long line, all of those things, it's magic.

24:03.260 --> 24:06.020
I mean, also imagine, so first of all,

24:06.020 --> 24:07.660
the ancient hunter gatherers, you know,

24:07.660 --> 24:09.020
you picture the mother gathering and eating

24:09.020 --> 24:10.380
for all this fresh food, no.

24:10.380 --> 24:11.980
So do you know what an avocado used to look like?

24:11.980 --> 24:15.940
It was a little like a sphere and the fruit of it,

24:15.940 --> 24:18.340
the actual avocado part was like a little tiny layer

24:18.340 --> 24:21.500
around this big pit that took up almost the whole volume.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.860
We've made the crazy like robot avocados today

24:25.860 --> 24:28.340
that have nothing to do with like what they,

24:28.340 --> 24:32.380
so same with bananas, these big sweet, you know,

24:33.300 --> 24:35.820
and not infested with bugs and grow, you know,

24:35.820 --> 24:37.780
they used to eat the shittiest food

24:38.700 --> 24:41.820
and they're eating uncooked meat or maybe they cook it

24:41.820 --> 24:44.740
and they're just, it's gross and things rot.

24:44.740 --> 24:46.700
So you go to the supermarket and it's just,

24:47.260 --> 24:49.940
A, it's like crazy, super engineered cartoon food,

24:49.940 --> 24:51.380
fruit and food.

24:51.380 --> 24:52.460
And then it's all this processed food,

24:52.460 --> 24:54.100
which, you know, we complain about in our setting.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.260
Oh, you know, we complain about, you know,

24:55.260 --> 24:56.740
we need too much process.

24:56.740 --> 24:58.260
That's a, this is a good problem.

24:58.260 --> 25:00.340
I mean, if you imagine what they would think,

25:00.340 --> 25:02.180
oh my God, a cracker, you know how delicious

25:02.180 --> 25:06.060
a cracker would taste to them, you know, candy,

25:06.060 --> 25:08.100
you know, pasta and spaghetti,

25:08.100 --> 25:09.380
they never had anything like this.

25:09.380 --> 25:11.460
And then you have from all over the world,

25:11.460 --> 25:13.940
I mean, things that are grown all over the place,

25:13.940 --> 25:16.060
all here in nice little racks organized

25:16.060 --> 25:17.940
and on a middle-class salary,

25:17.940 --> 25:20.100
you can afford anything you want.

25:20.100 --> 25:23.220
I mean, it's again, just like incredible gratitude,

25:23.220 --> 25:25.140
like, ah, yeah.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.460
And the question is how resilient is this whole thing?

25:27.460 --> 25:30.900
I mean, this is another darker version of your question

25:30.900 --> 25:35.260
is if we keep all the material possessions we have,

25:35.260 --> 25:39.540
but we start knocking out some percent of the population,

25:39.540 --> 25:42.100
how resilient is the system that we built up?

25:42.100 --> 25:44.980
Or if we rely on other humans and the knowledge

25:45.020 --> 25:48.860
built up on the past, the distributed nature of knowledge,

25:50.100 --> 25:52.940
how much does it take?

25:52.940 --> 25:55.460
How many humans need to disappear

25:55.460 --> 25:57.820
for us to be completely lost?

25:57.820 --> 25:59.180
Well, I'm trying to go off one thing,

25:59.180 --> 26:02.500
which is Elon Musk says that he has this number

26:02.500 --> 26:05.940
a million in mind as the order of magnitude of people

26:05.940 --> 26:10.940
you need to be on Mars to truly be multi-planetary.

26:11.780 --> 26:16.780
Multi-planetary doesn't mean like when Neil Armstrong

26:18.420 --> 26:21.900
goes to the moon, they call it a great leap for mankind.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.740
It's not a great leap for anything.

26:23.740 --> 26:26.700
It is a great achievement for mankind.

26:26.700 --> 26:29.420
And I always like think about if the first fish

26:29.420 --> 26:31.900
to kind of go on land just kind of went up

26:31.900 --> 26:33.300
and gave the shore a high five

26:33.300 --> 26:34.180
and goes back into the water,

26:34.180 --> 26:36.020
that's not a great leap for life.

26:36.020 --> 26:37.220
That's a great achievement for that fish.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.140
And there should be a little statue of that fish

26:39.180 --> 26:41.380
in the water and everyone should celebrate the fish.

26:41.380 --> 26:44.860
But when we talk about a great leap for life,

26:44.860 --> 26:45.740
it's permanent.

26:45.740 --> 26:48.660
It's something that from now on, this is how things are.

26:48.660 --> 26:51.060
So this is part of why I get so excited about Mars,

26:51.060 --> 26:53.780
by the way, is because you can count on one hand,

26:53.780 --> 26:57.340
like the number of great leaps that we've had,

26:57.340 --> 27:01.500
like no life to life and single cell or simple cell

27:01.500 --> 27:05.620
to complex cell and single cell organisms to animals,

27:05.620 --> 27:09.220
to multi-cell animals and then ocean to land

27:09.220 --> 27:12.620
and then one planet to two planets, anyway, diversion.

27:12.620 --> 27:16.540
But the point is that we are officially,

27:16.540 --> 27:19.860
that leap for all of life has happened

27:19.860 --> 27:22.740
once the ships could stop coming from earth

27:22.740 --> 27:24.780
because there's some horrible catastrophic World War III

27:24.780 --> 27:26.260
and everyone dies on earth and they're fine

27:26.260 --> 27:29.220
and they can turn that certain X number of people

27:29.220 --> 27:33.060
into 7 billion population that's thriving just like earth.

27:33.060 --> 27:35.180
They can build ships, they can come back and recolonize earth

27:35.180 --> 27:37.180
because now we are officially multi-planetary

27:37.180 --> 27:38.860
where it's a self-sustaining.

27:38.860 --> 27:40.860
He says a million people is about what he thinks.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.580
Now that might be a specialized group.

27:42.580 --> 27:45.700
That's a very specifically selected million

27:45.700 --> 27:49.260
that has very, very skilled million people,

27:49.260 --> 27:51.580
not just maybe the average million on earth.

27:51.580 --> 27:53.180
But I think it depends what you're talking about.

27:53.180 --> 27:56.140
But I don't think, so one million is one 7,000th,

27:56.140 --> 27:58.460
one 8,000th of the current population.

27:58.460 --> 28:02.180
I think you need a very, very, very small fraction

28:02.180 --> 28:04.500
of humans on earth to get by.

28:04.500 --> 28:05.340
Obviously, you're not gonna have

28:05.340 --> 28:06.940
the same thriving civilization

28:06.940 --> 28:08.500
if you get to a smaller number,

28:08.500 --> 28:10.700
but it depends who you're killing off, I guess,

28:10.700 --> 28:11.940
is part of the question.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.340
Yeah, if you killed off half of the people

28:14.340 --> 28:15.700
just randomly right now, I think we'd be fine.

28:15.700 --> 28:18.740
It would be obviously a great awful tragedy.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.940
I think if you killed off three quarters

28:19.940 --> 28:20.780
of all people randomly,

28:20.780 --> 28:22.420
just three out of every four people drops dead,

28:22.420 --> 28:24.820
I think we'd have obviously the stock market would crash.

28:24.820 --> 28:27.020
We'd have a rough patch,

28:27.020 --> 28:30.540
but I almost can assure you that the species would be fine.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.780
Well, because the million number,

28:31.780 --> 28:33.780
like you said, it is specialized.

28:33.820 --> 28:36.580
So I think,

28:37.940 --> 28:39.140
because you have to do this,

28:39.140 --> 28:41.700
you have to basically do the iPhone experiment.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.060
Like literally, you have to be able

28:43.060 --> 28:46.180
to be able to manufacture computers.

28:46.180 --> 28:47.020
Yeah, everything.

28:47.020 --> 28:47.860
If you're gonna have the,

28:47.860 --> 28:49.460
self-sustaining means you can,

28:49.460 --> 28:50.900
any major important skill,

28:50.900 --> 28:53.660
any important piece of infrastructure on earth

28:53.660 --> 28:56.620
can be built there just as well.

28:57.580 --> 29:00.260
It'd be interesting to list out

29:00.260 --> 29:01.980
what are the important things,

29:01.980 --> 29:03.460
what are the important skills.

29:03.980 --> 29:05.980
I mean, you have to feed everyone.

29:05.980 --> 29:08.900
So, mass farming, things like that.

29:08.900 --> 29:12.580
You have mining, these questions.

29:12.580 --> 29:15.300
It's like the materials might be,

29:15.300 --> 29:17.660
I don't know, five mile, two miles underground.

29:17.660 --> 29:18.580
I don't know with that actual,

29:18.580 --> 29:21.340
but it's amazing to me

29:21.340 --> 29:23.100
just that these things got built in the first place.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.300
And they never got, no one built the first,

29:25.300 --> 29:28.220
the mine that we're getting stuff for the iPhone for

29:28.220 --> 29:30.700
probably wasn't built for the iPhone.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.300
Or in general, early mining was for,

29:34.140 --> 29:35.500
I assume that the industrial revolution,

29:35.500 --> 29:37.020
when we realized, oh, fossil fuels,

29:37.020 --> 29:40.020
we wanna extract this magical energy source.

29:40.020 --> 29:42.220
I assume that mining took a huge leap

29:42.220 --> 29:43.340
without knowing very much about this.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.740
I think you're gonna need mining,

29:45.740 --> 29:48.460
you're gonna need a lot of electrical engineers.

29:48.460 --> 29:50.060
If you're gonna have a civilization like ours,

29:50.060 --> 29:51.940
and of course you could have oil and lanterns,

29:51.940 --> 29:53.180
we could go way back.

29:53.180 --> 29:55.260
But if you're trying to build our today thing,

29:55.260 --> 29:58.340
you're gonna need energy and electricity

29:58.340 --> 30:00.620
and mines that can bring materials,

30:00.620 --> 30:03.380
and then you're gonna need a ton of plumbing

30:03.380 --> 30:05.340
and everything that entails.

30:05.340 --> 30:07.660
And like you said, food, but also the manufacturer,

30:07.660 --> 30:10.780
so like turning raw materials into something useful,

30:10.780 --> 30:13.020
that whole thing, like factories,

30:13.020 --> 30:15.540
some supply chain, transportation.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.460
Right, I mean, you think about,

30:17.460 --> 30:18.460
when we talk about the world hunger,

30:18.460 --> 30:21.780
one of the major problems is there's plenty of food,

30:21.780 --> 30:22.740
and by the time it arrives,

30:22.740 --> 30:24.700
most of it's gone bad in the truck,

30:24.700 --> 30:26.940
in a kind of an impoverished place.

30:26.940 --> 30:29.660
So it's like, again, we take it so for granted,

30:29.660 --> 30:32.780
all the food in the supermarket is fresh.

30:32.780 --> 30:35.420
It's all there, which always stresses me.

30:35.420 --> 30:36.420
If I were running a supermarket,

30:36.420 --> 30:37.900
I would always be so miserable

30:37.900 --> 30:41.620
about things going bad on the shelves.

30:41.620 --> 30:43.060
Or if you don't have enough, that's not good,

30:43.060 --> 30:44.340
but if you have too much, it goes bad anyway.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.860
Of course there would be entertainers too.

30:46.860 --> 30:48.940
Like somebody would have a YouTube channel

30:48.940 --> 30:50.820
that's running on Mars.

30:50.820 --> 30:53.140
There is something different

30:53.140 --> 30:57.820
about a civilization on Mars and Earth existing

30:57.820 --> 30:59.980
versus like a civilization in the United States

30:59.980 --> 31:01.380
versus Russia and China.

31:01.380 --> 31:05.140
Like that's a fundamentally different distance,

31:05.140 --> 31:07.020
like philosophically.

31:07.020 --> 31:08.140
Will it be like fuzzy?

31:08.140 --> 31:09.900
We know there'll be like a reality show on Mars

31:09.900 --> 31:11.380
that everyone on Earth is obsessed with,

31:11.380 --> 31:15.140
and I think if people are going back and forth enough,

31:15.140 --> 31:16.060
then it becomes fuzzy.

31:16.060 --> 31:17.580
It becomes like, oh, our friend's on Mars,

31:17.580 --> 31:20.340
and there's like this Mars versus Earth,

31:20.340 --> 31:22.620
and it becomes like fun tribalism.

31:22.620 --> 31:25.220
I think if people don't really go back and forth,

31:25.220 --> 31:26.260
and it really, they're there for,

31:26.260 --> 31:27.500
I think it could get kind of like,

31:27.500 --> 31:30.420
oh, we hate a lot of like us versus them stuff going on.

31:30.420 --> 31:33.900
There could be also war and space for territory.

31:33.900 --> 31:38.500
As first colony happens, China, Russia,

31:38.500 --> 31:41.740
or whoever, the European, different European nations,

31:41.740 --> 31:43.580
Switzerland finally gets their act together

31:43.580 --> 31:46.420
and starts wars, as it's supposed to be,

31:46.420 --> 31:47.260
staying out of all of them.

31:47.260 --> 31:49.100
Yeah, there's all kinds of crazy geopolitical things

31:49.100 --> 31:51.020
that like we have not even,

31:51.020 --> 31:52.740
no one's really even thought about too much yet,

31:52.740 --> 31:54.460
that like, it could get weird.

31:54.460 --> 31:56.260
Think about the 1500s,

31:56.260 --> 31:58.780
when it was suddenly like a race to like,

31:58.780 --> 32:01.380
colonize or capture land or discover new land

32:01.380 --> 32:04.340
that hasn't been, so it was like this new frontiers.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.860
And there's not really, the land is not,

32:06.860 --> 32:08.500
the thing about Crimea was like,

32:08.500 --> 32:11.300
this huge thing, cause this tiny peninsula switched.

32:11.300 --> 32:14.020
That's how like optimized everything has become.

32:14.020 --> 32:16.420
Everything has just like really stuck.

32:16.420 --> 32:18.540
Mars is a whole new world of like,

32:18.540 --> 32:20.780
territory, naming things,

32:21.140 --> 32:24.940
and it's a chance for new kind of governments maybe,

32:24.940 --> 32:27.460
or maybe it's just the colonies of these governments

32:27.460 --> 32:28.660
so we don't get that opportunity.

32:28.660 --> 32:30.620
I think it'd be cool if there's new countries being,

32:30.620 --> 32:32.180
totally new experiments.

32:32.180 --> 32:35.180
And that's fascinating cause Elon talks exactly about that

32:35.180 --> 32:36.540
and I believe that very much.

32:36.540 --> 32:40.420
Like that should be, like from the start,

32:40.420 --> 32:43.260
they should determine their own sovereignty.

32:43.260 --> 32:46.220
Like they should determine their own thing.

32:46.220 --> 32:50.260
There was one modern democracy in the late 1700s,

32:50.300 --> 32:53.500
the US, I mean, it was the only modern democracy.

32:53.500 --> 32:57.020
And now, of course, there's hundreds or dozens,

32:57.020 --> 32:58.820
many dozens, but I think part of the reason

32:58.820 --> 33:00.300
that was able to start, I mean,

33:00.300 --> 33:01.980
people didn't have the idea, people had the idea,

33:01.980 --> 33:05.900
it was that they had a clean slate, new place,

33:05.900 --> 33:06.740
and they suddenly were,

33:06.740 --> 33:10.220
so I think it would be a great opportunity to have,

33:10.220 --> 33:11.740
there's a lot of people have done that,

33:11.740 --> 33:13.940
oh, if I had my own government on an island,

33:13.940 --> 33:15.580
my own country, what would I do?

33:15.580 --> 33:20.140
And the US founders actually had the opportunity

33:20.980 --> 33:22.380
to do that fantasy, they were like, we can do it,

33:22.380 --> 33:24.580
let's make, okay, what's the perfect country?

33:24.580 --> 33:25.940
And they tried to make something.

33:25.940 --> 33:30.180
Sometimes progress is, it's not held up by our imagination,

33:30.180 --> 33:33.980
it's held up by just, there's no blank canvas

33:33.980 --> 33:34.980
to try something on.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.940
Yeah, it's an opportunity for a fresh start.

33:37.940 --> 33:39.700
You know, the funny thing about the conversation

33:39.700 --> 33:43.180
we're having is not often had, I mean, even by Elon,

33:43.180 --> 33:45.220
he's so focused on Starship and actually putting

33:45.220 --> 33:46.820
the first human on Mars.

33:47.420 --> 33:51.620
Thinking about this kind of stuff is inspiring.

33:51.620 --> 33:55.140
It makes us dream, it makes us hope for the future,

33:55.140 --> 33:58.300
and it makes us, somehow thinking about civilization

33:58.300 --> 34:02.060
on Mars is helping us think about the civilization

34:02.060 --> 34:05.020
here on Earth, how we should run it.

34:05.020 --> 34:08.140
What do you think are, like in our lifetime,

34:08.140 --> 34:11.180
I think any effort that goes to Mars,

34:11.180 --> 34:13.260
the goal is in this decade.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.420
Do you think that's actually gonna be achieved?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.860
I have a big bet, $10,000 with a friend

34:18.860 --> 34:21.500
when I was drunk in an argument.

34:21.500 --> 34:22.340
This is great.

34:22.340 --> 34:25.180
That Neil Armstrong of Mars, whoever he or she may be,

34:25.180 --> 34:28.700
will set foot by the end of 2030.

34:28.700 --> 34:30.980
Now, this was probably in 2018 when I had this argument.

34:30.980 --> 34:31.820
So, like what if it?

34:31.820 --> 34:35.580
So a human has to touch Mars by the end of 2030.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.180
Oh, by the year 30.

34:37.180 --> 34:39.620
Yeah, by January 1st, 2031.

34:39.620 --> 34:40.460
Yeah.

34:40.460 --> 34:41.700
So.

34:41.700 --> 34:44.140
Did you agree on the time zone or what?

34:44.140 --> 34:44.980
No, no.

34:44.980 --> 34:46.100
If it's coming on that exact day,

34:46.100 --> 34:47.300
that's gonna be really stressful.

34:47.300 --> 34:52.140
But anyway, because I think that there will be.

34:52.140 --> 34:53.260
That was 2018.

34:53.260 --> 34:54.940
I was more confident then.

34:54.940 --> 34:56.260
I think it's gonna be around this time.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.260
I mean, I still won the general bet,

34:58.260 --> 34:59.700
because his point was, you are crazy.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.100
This is not gonna happen in our lifetime.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.620
They're not for many, many decades.

35:02.620 --> 35:03.500
And I said, you're wrong.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.500
You don't know what's going on in SpaceX.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.180
I think if the world depended on it,

35:08.180 --> 35:10.460
I think probably SpaceX could probably,

35:10.460 --> 35:11.500
I mean, I don't know this,

35:11.500 --> 35:14.420
but I think the tech is almost there.

35:14.420 --> 35:16.140
Like, I don't think, of course,

35:16.140 --> 35:18.180
it's delayed many years by safety.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.340
So they first wanna send a ship around Mars

35:20.340 --> 35:22.060
and they wanna land a cargo ship on Mars.

35:22.060 --> 35:23.300
And there's the moon on the way to.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.340
Yeah, yeah, there's a lot.

35:24.340 --> 35:27.020
But I think the moon, a decade before,

35:27.020 --> 35:30.660
seemed like magical tech that humans didn't have.

35:30.660 --> 35:33.180
This is like, no, we can,

35:33.180 --> 35:36.740
it's totally conceivable that this scene starship,

35:36.740 --> 35:41.700
like it's, it is a interplanetary colonial,

35:41.700 --> 35:43.940
or interplanetary transport like system.

35:43.940 --> 35:45.380
That's what they used to call it.

35:45.380 --> 35:47.540
The SpaceX, the way they do it is,

35:47.540 --> 35:49.020
every time they do a launch,

35:49.020 --> 35:52.140
something fails usually, when they're testing,

35:52.140 --> 35:54.300
and they learn a thousand things.

35:54.300 --> 35:57.300
The amount of data they get and they improve so,

35:57.300 --> 36:00.140
each one has, it's like they've moved up

36:00.140 --> 36:01.580
like eight generations in each one.

36:01.580 --> 36:04.460
Anyway, so it's not inconceivable that pretty soon

36:04.460 --> 36:07.580
they could send a starship to Mars and land it.

36:07.580 --> 36:08.540
There's just no good reason,

36:08.540 --> 36:09.780
I don't think that they couldn't do that.

36:09.780 --> 36:10.820
And so if they could do that,

36:10.820 --> 36:13.860
they could, in theory, send a person to Mars pretty soon.

36:13.860 --> 36:15.700
Now, taking off from Mars and coming back,

36:15.700 --> 36:17.660
again, I think, I don't think anyone

36:17.660 --> 36:19.180
want to be on that voyage today,

36:19.180 --> 36:22.900
because there's just, it's still amateur hour here,

36:22.900 --> 36:24.620
getting that perfect.

36:24.620 --> 36:25.940
But I don't think we're too far away now.

36:25.940 --> 36:29.980
The question is, so every 26 months,

36:29.980 --> 36:31.660
Earth laps Mars, right?

36:31.660 --> 36:34.220
It's like the sinusoidal orbit

36:34.220 --> 36:37.180
or whatever it's called, the period, 26 months.

36:37.180 --> 36:39.060
So it's right now, like in the evens,

36:39.060 --> 36:42.980
like 2022 is gonna have one of these, late 2024.

36:42.980 --> 36:45.180
So people could, this was the earliest estimate I heard.

36:45.180 --> 36:49.140
Elon said, maybe we can send people to Mars in 2024,

36:49.140 --> 36:51.700
to land in early 2025.

36:51.700 --> 36:52.660
That is not gonna happen,

36:52.660 --> 36:56.540
because that included 2022 sending a cargo ship to Mars,

36:56.540 --> 36:58.500
maybe even one in 2020.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.100
And so I think they're not quite on that schedule,

37:00.100 --> 37:03.340
but to win my bet, 2027, I have a chance,

37:03.340 --> 37:05.540
and 2029, I have another chance.

37:05.540 --> 37:06.900
We're not very good at like backing up

37:06.900 --> 37:07.740
and seeing the big picture.

37:07.740 --> 37:09.260
We're very distracted by what's going on today

37:09.260 --> 37:10.820
and what we can believe,

37:10.820 --> 37:12.460
because it's happening in front of our face.

37:12.460 --> 37:15.420
There's no way that humans is gonna be landing on Mars

37:15.420 --> 37:17.500
and it's not gonna be the only thing

37:17.500 --> 37:18.860
everyone is talking about, right?

37:18.860 --> 37:20.460
I mean, it's gonna be the moon landing,

37:20.460 --> 37:23.020
but even bigger deal, going to another planet, right?

37:23.020 --> 37:24.620
And for it to start a colony,

37:24.620 --> 37:27.060
not just to, again, high five and come back.

37:27.060 --> 37:31.740
So this is like the 2020s, maybe the 2030s,

37:31.740 --> 37:33.180
is gonna be the new 1960s.

37:33.180 --> 37:34.260
We're gonna have a space decade.

37:34.260 --> 37:35.980
I'm so excited about it.

37:35.980 --> 37:38.060
And again, it's one of the great leaps for all of life

37:38.060 --> 37:39.260
happening in our lifetimes.

37:39.260 --> 37:40.500
Like that's wild.

37:40.500 --> 37:43.740
To paint a slightly cynical possibility,

37:43.740 --> 37:46.100
which I don't see happening,

37:46.100 --> 37:49.260
but I just wanna put sort of value into leadership.

37:49.260 --> 37:52.580
I think it wasn't obvious that the moon landing

37:52.580 --> 37:55.020
would be so exciting for all of human civilization.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.980
Some of that have to do with the right speeches,

37:57.900 --> 37:59.260
with the space race.

37:59.260 --> 38:03.260
Like space, depending on how it's presented can be boring.

38:03.260 --> 38:06.460
I don't think it's been that so far,

38:06.460 --> 38:07.300
but I've actually-

38:07.300 --> 38:10.180
I think space is quite boring right now.

38:10.180 --> 38:13.820
Not, no, SpaceX is super, but like 10 years ago space.

38:13.820 --> 38:15.780
Some writer, I forget who wrote,

38:15.780 --> 38:17.620
it's like the best magic trick in the show

38:17.620 --> 38:18.540
happened at the beginning,

38:18.540 --> 38:20.580
and now they're starting to do this like easy hazard.

38:20.580 --> 38:21.660
It's like, you can't go in that direction.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.540
And the line that this writer said is like,

38:23.540 --> 38:28.380
watching astronauts go up to the space station

38:28.380 --> 38:30.460
after watching the moon is like watching Columbus

38:30.460 --> 38:31.780
sail to Ibiza.

38:31.780 --> 38:34.860
It's just like, everything is so practical.

38:34.860 --> 38:36.700
You're going up to the space station, not to explore,

38:36.700 --> 38:38.580
but to do science experiments in microgravity.

38:38.580 --> 38:41.500
And you're sending rockets up,

38:41.500 --> 38:43.060
mostly here and there, there's a probe,

38:43.060 --> 38:45.780
but mostly you're sending up to put satellites

38:45.780 --> 38:48.500
for DirecTV or whatever it is.

38:48.500 --> 38:51.780
It's kind of like lame earth industry usage.

38:52.780 --> 38:55.580
So I agree with you, space is boring there.

38:55.580 --> 38:59.780
The first human setting foot on Mars,

38:59.780 --> 39:01.700
that's gotta be a crazy global event.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.500
I can't imagine it not being, maybe you're right.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.260
Maybe I'm taking for granted the speeches

39:05.260 --> 39:06.500
and the space race and the-

39:06.500 --> 39:09.900
I think the value of, I guess what I'm pushing

39:09.900 --> 39:12.060
is the value of people like Elon Musk

39:12.060 --> 39:14.460
and potentially other leaders that hopefully step up.

39:14.460 --> 39:16.140
It's extremely important here.

39:16.140 --> 39:19.260
Like I would argue without the publicity of SpaceX,

39:19.260 --> 39:21.340
it's not just the ingenuity of SpaceX,

39:22.140 --> 39:24.660
but what they've done publicly by having a figure

39:24.660 --> 39:27.580
that tweets and all that kind of stuff like that.

39:27.580 --> 39:29.860
That's a source of inspiration.

39:29.860 --> 39:32.620
NASA wasn't able to quite pull off with a shuttle.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.940
That's one of his two reasons for doing this.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.180
SpaceX exists for two reasons.

39:37.180 --> 39:40.020
One, life insurance for the species.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.500
I always think about it this way.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.380
If you're an alien on some far away planet

39:44.380 --> 39:46.660
and you're rooting against humanity,

39:46.660 --> 39:49.500
and you win the bet if humanity goes extinct,

39:49.540 --> 39:51.500
you do not like SpaceX.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.260
You do not want them to have their eggs in two baskets now.

39:56.860 --> 39:59.140
Sure, it's like obviously you could have some,

39:59.140 --> 40:00.580
something that kills everyone on both planets,

40:00.580 --> 40:02.060
some AI war or something,

40:02.060 --> 40:06.860
but the point is obviously it's good for our chances,

40:06.860 --> 40:08.580
our long-term chances to be having

40:08.580 --> 40:11.300
two self-sustaining civilizations going on.

40:11.300 --> 40:14.980
The second reason, he values this I think just as high,

40:14.980 --> 40:17.380
is it's the greatest adventure in history,

40:17.380 --> 40:18.940
going multi-planetary,

40:18.940 --> 40:21.860
and that people need some reason to wake up in the morning

40:21.860 --> 40:26.260
and it'll just be this hopefully great uniting event too.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.900
I mean, I'm sure in today's nasty,

40:27.900 --> 40:29.580
awful political environment,

40:29.580 --> 40:34.100
which is like a whirlpool that sucks everything into it.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.660
So it doesn't mean you name a thing

40:35.660 --> 40:38.020
and it's become a nasty political topic.

40:38.020 --> 40:42.700
So I hope that space can,

40:42.700 --> 40:44.780
Mars can just bring everyone together,

40:44.780 --> 40:46.940
but it could become this hideous thing

40:46.940 --> 40:48.660
where it's a billionaire,

40:48.660 --> 40:50.740
some annoying storyline gets built.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.660
So half the people think that anyone who's excited

40:52.660 --> 40:55.700
about Mars is an evil something.

40:55.700 --> 40:57.940
Anyway, I hope it is super exciting.

40:57.940 --> 41:02.940
So far, space has been a uniting, inspiring thing.

41:03.180 --> 41:06.020
And in fact, especially during this time of a pandemic,

41:06.020 --> 41:08.980
has been just a commercial entity

41:08.980 --> 41:12.060
putting out humans into space for the first time

41:12.060 --> 41:15.260
was just one of the only big sources of hope.

41:15.260 --> 41:16.100
Totally.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.980
And awe, just like watching this huge skyscraper

41:18.980 --> 41:21.460
go up in the air, flip over, come back down and land.

41:21.460 --> 41:23.180
I mean, it just makes everyone just wanna sit back

41:23.180 --> 41:24.820
and clap and kind of like,

41:24.820 --> 41:27.340
you know, the way I look at something like SpaceX is

41:27.340 --> 41:30.260
it makes me proud to be a human.

41:30.260 --> 41:31.500
And I think it makes a lot of people feel that way.

41:31.500 --> 41:33.220
It's like good for our self-esteem.

41:33.220 --> 41:34.140
It's like, you know what, we're pretty,

41:34.140 --> 41:35.660
you know, we have a lot of problems,

41:35.660 --> 41:36.940
but like we're kind of awesome.

41:36.940 --> 41:37.780
Yeah, we're awesome.

41:37.780 --> 41:38.780
If we can put people on Mars,

41:38.780 --> 41:41.380
you know, sticking up an earth flag on Mars,

41:41.380 --> 41:43.780
like, damn, you know, we should be so proud

41:43.820 --> 41:45.340
of our like little family here.

41:45.340 --> 41:46.420
Like we did something cool.

41:46.420 --> 41:51.140
And by the way, I've made it clear to SpaceX people,

41:51.140 --> 41:52.540
including Elon, many times,

41:52.540 --> 41:54.020
and it's like once a year reminder

41:54.020 --> 41:56.860
that if they want to make this more exciting,

41:56.860 --> 42:00.820
they send the writer to Mars on the thing.

42:00.820 --> 42:02.300
And I'll blog about it.

42:02.300 --> 42:04.900
So I'm just, you know, continuing to throw this out there.

42:04.900 --> 42:05.740
On which trip?

42:05.740 --> 42:07.540
I'm trying to get them to send me to Mars.

42:07.540 --> 42:08.860
I understand that.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.260
So I just wanna clarify,

42:10.260 --> 42:12.380
on which trip does the writer wanna go?

42:12.420 --> 42:14.100
I think my dream one, to be honest,

42:14.100 --> 42:16.940
would be like the, you know, like the Apollo 8,

42:16.940 --> 42:19.700
where they just looped around the moon and came back.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.700
Cause landing on Mars...

42:22.700 --> 42:24.860
Give you a lot of good content to write about.

42:24.860 --> 42:26.180
Great content, right?

42:26.180 --> 42:28.620
I mean, the amount of kind of high-minded, you know,

42:28.620 --> 42:32.180
and so I would go into the thing and I would blog about it.

42:32.180 --> 42:34.060
And I'd be in microgravity.

42:34.060 --> 42:35.500
So I'd be bouncing around my little space.

42:35.500 --> 42:37.020
I get a little, they can just send me in a dragon.

42:37.020 --> 42:38.500
They don't need to do a whole starship.

42:38.500 --> 42:41.220
And I would bounce around and I would get to,

42:41.780 --> 42:44.820
I've always had a dream of going to like

42:44.820 --> 42:46.900
one of those nice jails for a year.

42:46.900 --> 42:47.740
Yes.

42:47.740 --> 42:48.660
Because I just have nothing to do

42:48.660 --> 42:50.780
besides like read books and no responsibilities,

42:50.780 --> 42:51.620
no social plans.

42:51.620 --> 42:53.500
So this is the ultimate version of that.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.260
Anyway, it's a side topic, but I think it would be...

42:55.260 --> 42:57.220
But also if you, I mean, to be honest,

42:57.220 --> 43:00.020
if you land on Mars, it's epic.

43:00.020 --> 43:01.980
And then if you die there,

43:01.980 --> 43:04.020
of like finishing your writing,

43:04.020 --> 43:06.540
it will be just even that much more powerful

43:06.540 --> 43:08.900
for the impact that you're profiting.

43:08.900 --> 43:09.740
Yeah, but then I'm gone

43:09.780 --> 43:11.500
and I don't even get to like experience

43:11.500 --> 43:13.540
the publication of it, which is the whole point of stuff.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.300
Well, some of the greatest writers in history

43:15.300 --> 43:16.940
didn't get a chance to experience

43:16.940 --> 43:18.100
the publication of their great-

43:18.100 --> 43:18.940
I know.

43:18.940 --> 43:19.780
I don't really think that.

43:19.780 --> 43:20.940
I think back to Jesus and I'm like,

43:20.940 --> 43:23.220
oh man, that guy really like crushed it, you know?

43:23.220 --> 43:24.780
But then if you think about it,

43:26.100 --> 43:28.380
it doesn't like, you could literally die today

43:28.380 --> 43:30.340
and then become the next Jesus,

43:30.340 --> 43:32.180
like 2000 years from now in this civilization

43:32.180 --> 43:35.900
that's like, they're like in magical in the clouds

43:35.900 --> 43:37.340
and they're worshiping you.

43:37.340 --> 43:38.780
They're worshiping Lex.

43:38.780 --> 43:40.700
And like, that sounds like your ego probably would be like,

43:40.700 --> 43:43.100
wow, that's pretty cool, except irrelevant to you

43:43.100 --> 43:44.300
because you never even knew it happened.

43:44.300 --> 43:46.500
This feels like a Rick and Morty episode.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.940
It does, it does.

43:47.940 --> 43:51.740
Okay, you've talked to Elon quite a bit.

43:51.740 --> 43:53.860
You've written about him quite a bit.

43:53.860 --> 43:58.300
Just, it'd be cool to hear you talk about

43:58.300 --> 44:00.180
what are your ideas of what, you know,

44:00.180 --> 44:02.980
the magic sauce is you've written about with Elon.

44:02.980 --> 44:06.060
What makes him so successful?

44:06.060 --> 44:09.060
His style of thinking, his ambition, his dreams,

44:09.060 --> 44:11.780
his, the people he connects with,

44:11.780 --> 44:13.140
the kind of problems he tackles.

44:13.140 --> 44:14.740
Is there kind of comments you can make

44:14.740 --> 44:16.260
about what makes him special?

44:16.260 --> 44:18.500
I think that obviously there's a lot of things

44:18.500 --> 44:19.420
that he's very good at.

44:19.420 --> 44:23.260
He has, he's obviously super intelligent.

44:23.260 --> 44:25.940
His heart is very much in like, I think the right place.

44:25.940 --> 44:27.780
Like, you know, I really, really believe that.

44:27.780 --> 44:30.100
Like, and I think people can sense that, you know,

44:30.100 --> 44:32.820
he just doesn't seem like a grifter of any kind.

44:32.820 --> 44:34.580
He's truly trying to do these big things

44:34.580 --> 44:36.100
for the right reasons.

44:36.100 --> 44:38.380
And he's obviously crazy ambitious and hardworking, right?

44:38.380 --> 44:39.220
Not everyone is.

44:39.220 --> 44:40.860
Some people are as talented and have cool visions,

44:40.860 --> 44:43.820
but they just don't wanna spend their life that way.

44:43.820 --> 44:46.420
So, but that's, none of those alone

44:46.420 --> 44:48.140
is what makes Elon Elon.

44:48.140 --> 44:49.820
I mean, if it were, there'd be more of him

44:49.820 --> 44:51.500
because there's a lot of people that are very smart

44:51.500 --> 44:53.260
and smart enough to accumulate a lot of money

44:53.260 --> 44:55.300
and influence and they have great ambition

44:55.300 --> 44:58.820
and they have, you know, their hearts in the right place.

44:58.820 --> 45:01.980
To me, it is of the very unusual quality he has

45:01.980 --> 45:04.020
is that he's sane in a way

45:04.020 --> 45:06.380
that almost every human is crazy.

45:06.380 --> 45:08.820
What I mean by that is we are programmed

45:10.500 --> 45:15.500
to trust conventional wisdom over our own reasoning

45:17.540 --> 45:19.140
for good reason.

45:19.140 --> 45:22.820
If you go back 50,000 years and conventional wisdom says,

45:22.820 --> 45:26.020
you know, don't eat that berry, you know,

45:26.020 --> 45:28.900
or this is the way you tie a spearhead to a spear

45:29.900 --> 45:31.660
and you're thinking, I'm smarter than that.

45:32.020 --> 45:35.100
You're not, you know, that comes from the accumulation

45:35.100 --> 45:37.020
of life experience, accumulation of observation

45:37.020 --> 45:39.620
and experience over many generations.

45:39.620 --> 45:41.780
And that's a little mini version

45:41.780 --> 45:43.380
of the collective super intelligence.

45:43.380 --> 45:45.340
It's like, you know, it's equivalent

45:45.340 --> 45:46.620
of like making a pencil today.

45:46.620 --> 45:51.620
Like people back then, like the conventional wisdom

45:51.860 --> 45:54.140
like had this super, this knowledge

45:54.140 --> 45:56.100
that no human could ever accumulate.

45:56.100 --> 45:57.740
So we're very wired to trust it.

45:57.740 --> 46:00.820
Plus the secondary thing is that the people who, you know,

46:00.820 --> 46:02.740
just say that they believe the mountain is,

46:02.740 --> 46:04.700
they worship the mountain as their God, right?

46:04.700 --> 46:06.100
And the mountain determines their faith.

46:06.100 --> 46:07.340
That's not true, right?

46:07.340 --> 46:08.580
And the conventional wisdom is wrong there,

46:08.580 --> 46:12.740
but believing it was helpful to survival

46:12.740 --> 46:15.300
because you were part of the crowd

46:15.300 --> 46:16.140
and you stayed in the tribe.

46:16.140 --> 46:20.260
And if you started to, you know, insult the mountain God

46:20.260 --> 46:22.220
and say, that's just a mountain, it's not, you know,

46:22.220 --> 46:23.340
you didn't fare very well, right?

46:23.340 --> 46:25.860
So for a lot of reasons, it was a great survival trait

46:25.860 --> 46:29.420
to just trust what other people said and believe it.

46:29.420 --> 46:30.700
And truly, you know, obviously, you know,

46:30.700 --> 46:32.980
the more you really believed it, the better.

46:32.980 --> 46:37.980
Today, conventional wisdom in a rapidly changing world

46:39.860 --> 46:42.420
and a huge giant society,

46:42.420 --> 46:44.180
our brains are not built to understand that.

46:44.180 --> 46:45.660
They have a few settings, you know,

46:45.660 --> 46:47.740
and none of them is, you know,

46:47.740 --> 46:49.580
300 million person society.

46:49.580 --> 46:52.420
So they're, so your brain is basically

46:54.860 --> 46:57.740
is treating a lot of things like a small tribe,

46:57.740 --> 46:58.580
even though they're not.

46:58.740 --> 47:01.660
And they're treating conventional wisdom as, you know,

47:01.660 --> 47:03.660
very wise in a way that it's not.

47:03.660 --> 47:05.820
If you think about it this way, it's like a picture A,

47:05.820 --> 47:08.220
like a bucket that's not moving very much,

47:08.220 --> 47:09.500
moving like a millimeter a year.

47:09.500 --> 47:11.260
And so it has time to collect a lot of water in it.

47:11.260 --> 47:12.100
That's like conventional wisdom.

47:12.100 --> 47:13.660
In the old days, when very few things changed,

47:13.660 --> 47:15.940
like your 10, you know, great, great, great grandmother

47:15.940 --> 47:17.060
probably lived a similar life to you,

47:17.060 --> 47:19.300
maybe on the same piece of land.

47:19.300 --> 47:21.180
And so old people really knew what they were talking about.

47:21.180 --> 47:23.380
Today, the bucket's moving really quickly.

47:23.380 --> 47:25.180
And so, you know, the wisdom doesn't accumulate,

47:25.180 --> 47:27.260
but we think it does because our brain settings

47:27.260 --> 47:29.060
doesn't have the, oh, move, you know,

47:29.060 --> 47:31.540
quickly moving bucket setting on it.

47:31.540 --> 47:35.700
So my grandmother gives me advice all the time.

47:35.700 --> 47:38.500
And I have to decide, is this,

47:38.500 --> 47:40.260
so there are certain things that are not changing,

47:40.260 --> 47:44.060
like relationships and love and loyalty and things like this.

47:44.060 --> 47:45.780
Her advice on those things, I'll listen to it all day.

47:45.780 --> 47:46.860
She's one of the people who said,

47:46.860 --> 47:48.540
you've got to live near your people you love,

47:48.540 --> 47:50.060
live near your family, right?

47:50.060 --> 47:52.860
I think that is like tremendous wisdom, right?

47:52.860 --> 47:54.500
That is wisdom, because that happens to be something

47:54.500 --> 47:56.660
that hasn't, doesn't change from generation to generation.

47:56.660 --> 47:57.500
For now.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.620
Right, she all, right, for now.

47:59.620 --> 48:01.540
She's also telling, right, so I'll be the idiot

48:01.540 --> 48:03.340
telling my brain exactly, they'll actually be in the,

48:03.340 --> 48:05.740
it's a metaverse like being like, it doesn't matter.

48:05.740 --> 48:07.460
And I'm like, you have to, it's not the same

48:07.460 --> 48:08.300
when you're not in person.

48:08.300 --> 48:10.380
They're gonna say, it's exactly the same.

48:10.380 --> 48:11.700
And they'll also be thinking to me

48:11.700 --> 48:13.860
with their neurolink and I'm gonna be like, slow down.

48:13.860 --> 48:14.940
I don't understand what you're saying.

48:14.940 --> 48:16.580
You just talk like a normal person.

48:16.580 --> 48:19.500
Anyway, so my grandmother then, but then she says,

48:19.500 --> 48:21.300
you know, you're, I don't know about this writing

48:21.300 --> 48:23.060
you're doing, you should go to law school

48:23.060 --> 48:25.140
and you know, you wanna be secure.

48:25.140 --> 48:26.820
And that's not good advice for me.

48:26.820 --> 48:29.300
You know, given the world I'm in and what I like to do

48:29.300 --> 48:31.820
and what I'm good at, that's not the right advice.

48:31.820 --> 48:34.740
But because the world is totally, she's in a different world.

48:34.740 --> 48:37.460
So she became wise for a world that's no longer here, right?

48:37.460 --> 48:39.780
Now, if you think about that, so then when we think

48:39.780 --> 48:41.820
about conventional wisdom, it's a little like my grandmother

48:41.820 --> 48:45.100
and there's a lot of, no, it's not maybe, you know,

48:45.100 --> 48:47.140
60 years outdated, like her software.

48:47.140 --> 48:50.220
It's maybe 10 years outdated to conventional wisdom,

48:50.220 --> 48:51.540
sometimes 20.

48:51.540 --> 48:55.900
So anyway, I think that we all continually don't have

48:55.900 --> 48:59.260
the confidence in our own reasoning when it conflicts

48:59.260 --> 49:02.780
with what everyone else thinks, with what seems right.

49:02.780 --> 49:06.140
We don't have the guts to act on that reasoning

49:06.140 --> 49:07.100
for that reason, right?

49:07.100 --> 49:11.020
You know, we, and so there's so many Elon examples.

49:11.020 --> 49:12.220
I mean, just from the beginning,

49:12.220 --> 49:14.740
building Zip2 was the first company.

49:15.620 --> 49:20.620
And it was internet advertising at the time when people said,

49:20.820 --> 49:22.100
this internet was brand new,

49:22.100 --> 49:23.980
like kind of thinking of like the metaverse,

49:23.980 --> 49:25.300
VR metaverse today and people being like,

49:25.300 --> 49:29.100
oh, we're saying, we still facilitate internet advertising.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.700
People were saying, yeah, people are gonna advertise

49:30.700 --> 49:31.980
on the internet, yeah, right.

49:31.980 --> 49:34.740
Actually, it wasn't that he's magical and saw the future

49:34.740 --> 49:36.260
is that he looked at the present,

49:36.260 --> 49:38.460
looked at what the internet was,

49:38.460 --> 49:42.420
thought about the obvious advertising opportunity

49:42.420 --> 49:43.980
this was gonna be.

49:43.980 --> 49:45.300
It wasn't rocket science.

49:45.300 --> 49:46.740
It wasn't genius, I don't believe.

49:46.740 --> 49:49.060
I think it was just seeing the truth.

49:49.060 --> 49:50.460
And when everyone else is laughing saying,

49:51.300 --> 49:52.140
well, you're wrong.

49:52.140 --> 49:54.740
I mean, I did the math and here it is, right?

49:54.740 --> 49:58.540
Next company, X.com, which became eventually PayPal,

49:59.660 --> 50:00.500
people said, oh yeah,

50:00.500 --> 50:01.740
people are gonna put their financial information

50:01.740 --> 50:03.500
on the internet, no way.

50:05.180 --> 50:06.220
To us, it seems so obvious.

50:06.220 --> 50:08.060
If you went back then, you would probably feel the same

50:08.060 --> 50:10.620
where you'd think this is, that is a fake company,

50:10.620 --> 50:12.900
that no, it's just obviously not a good idea.

50:12.900 --> 50:14.420
He looked around and said, you know, I see where this is.

50:14.420 --> 50:15.740
And so again, he could see where it was going

50:15.740 --> 50:17.260
because he could see what it was that day.

50:17.260 --> 50:18.580
And not what it, you know, not people,

50:18.580 --> 50:21.700
conventional wisdom was still a bunch of years earlier.

50:21.700 --> 50:23.900
SpaceX is the ultimate example.

50:23.900 --> 50:27.860
A friend of his apparently actually compiled a montage,

50:27.860 --> 50:30.300
video montage of rockets blowing up to show him

50:30.300 --> 50:32.140
this is not a good idea.

50:32.140 --> 50:34.500
And if, but just even the bigger picture,

50:34.500 --> 50:36.260
the amount of billionaires who have like thought

50:36.260 --> 50:38.860
this was, I'm gonna start launching rockets

50:38.860 --> 50:40.420
and you know, the amount that failed.

50:40.420 --> 50:43.580
I mean, it's not conventional wisdom said

50:43.580 --> 50:44.660
this isn't a bad endeavor.

50:44.660 --> 50:46.020
He was putting all of his money into it.

50:46.020 --> 50:47.300
Yeah.

50:47.300 --> 50:49.500
Landing rockets was another thing, you know,

50:49.500 --> 50:52.900
well, here's the classic kind of way we reason,

50:52.900 --> 50:55.500
which is if this could be done,

50:55.500 --> 50:57.340
NASA would have done it a long time ago

50:57.340 --> 50:58.660
because of the money it would save.

50:58.660 --> 51:00.220
This could be done, the Soviet Union would have done it

51:00.220 --> 51:01.700
back in the sixties.

51:01.700 --> 51:03.500
It's obviously something that can't be done.

51:03.500 --> 51:06.300
And the math on his envelope said,

51:06.300 --> 51:07.300
well, I think it can be done.

51:07.300 --> 51:08.180
And so he just did it.

51:08.180 --> 51:10.100
So in each of these cases, I think actually

51:10.100 --> 51:12.340
in some ways, Elon gets too much credit as, you know,

51:12.340 --> 51:13.980
people think it's that he's, you know,

51:13.980 --> 51:15.460
it's that his Einstein intelligence

51:15.660 --> 51:16.700
he can see the future.

51:16.700 --> 51:19.580
He has incredible, he has incredible guts.

51:19.580 --> 51:20.820
He's so courageous.

51:20.820 --> 51:23.500
I think if you actually are looking at reality

51:24.740 --> 51:26.660
and you're just assessing probabilities

51:26.660 --> 51:29.180
and you're ignoring all the noise, which is wrong,

51:29.180 --> 51:30.300
so wrong, right?

51:30.300 --> 51:33.060
And you just, then you just have to be, you know,

51:33.060 --> 51:36.460
pretty smart and you know, pretty courageous.

51:36.460 --> 51:39.740
And you have to have this magical ability to be sane

51:39.740 --> 51:42.220
and trust your reasoning over conventional wisdom

51:42.220 --> 51:44.580
because your individual reasoning, you know,

51:44.580 --> 51:46.780
part of it is that we see that we can't build a pencil.

51:46.780 --> 51:49.340
We can't build, you know, this civilization on our own,

51:49.340 --> 51:50.180
right?

51:50.180 --> 51:51.660
So we kind of count, you know,

51:51.660 --> 51:56.300
tout to the collective for good reason,

51:56.300 --> 51:57.820
but this is different when it comes to kind of

51:57.820 --> 52:00.140
what's possible, you know, the Beatles were doing

52:00.140 --> 52:03.780
their kind of Motowny chord patterns in the early sixties

52:03.780 --> 52:05.540
and they were doing what was normal.

52:05.540 --> 52:06.740
They were doing what was clearly

52:06.740 --> 52:08.900
this kind of sound is a hit.

52:08.900 --> 52:10.060
Then they started getting weird

52:10.060 --> 52:11.500
because they had, they were so popular.

52:11.500 --> 52:13.020
They had this confidence to say, let's just,

52:13.020 --> 52:15.140
and we're gonna start just experimenting.

52:15.140 --> 52:17.620
And it turns out that like, if you just,

52:17.620 --> 52:19.660
all these people are in this like one groove together

52:19.660 --> 52:20.820
doing music and it's just like,

52:20.820 --> 52:22.900
there's a lot of land over there.

52:22.900 --> 52:25.740
And it seems like, you know, I'm sure the managers would say

52:25.740 --> 52:27.980
and that the, all the record executives would say,

52:27.980 --> 52:28.980
no, you have to be here.

52:28.980 --> 52:30.380
This is what sells.

52:30.380 --> 52:31.900
And it's just not true.

52:31.900 --> 52:35.260
So I think that Elon is, the term for this

52:35.260 --> 52:37.460
that actually Elon likes to use is reasoning

52:37.460 --> 52:39.900
from first principles, the physics term.

52:39.900 --> 52:41.660
First principles are your axioms.

52:41.860 --> 52:43.460
Physicists, they don't say, well, what's,

52:43.460 --> 52:44.980
you know, what do people think?

52:44.980 --> 52:46.340
No, they say, what are the axioms?

52:46.340 --> 52:47.300
Those are the puzzle pieces.

52:47.300 --> 52:49.340
Let's use those to build a conclusion.

52:49.340 --> 52:50.220
That's our hypothesis.

52:50.220 --> 52:51.060
Now let's test it.

52:51.060 --> 52:53.340
And they come up with all kinds of new things

52:53.340 --> 52:55.100
constantly by doing that.

52:55.100 --> 52:57.460
If Einstein was assuming conventional wisdom is right,

52:57.460 --> 52:59.380
he never would have even tried to create something

52:59.380 --> 53:02.100
that really disproved Newton's laws.

53:02.100 --> 53:05.500
And the other way to reason is reasoning by analogy,

53:05.500 --> 53:08.140
which is a great shortcut.

53:08.140 --> 53:10.500
It's when we look at other people's reasoning

53:10.500 --> 53:13.300
and we kind of photocopy it into our head, we steal it.

53:13.300 --> 53:15.940
So reasoning by analogy, we do all the time

53:15.940 --> 53:17.020
and it's usually a good thing.

53:17.020 --> 53:19.300
I mean, we don't, if you, it takes a lot of mental energy

53:19.300 --> 53:20.620
and time to reason from first principles.

53:20.620 --> 53:22.300
It's actually, you know, you don't want to reinvent

53:22.300 --> 53:23.340
the wheel every time, right?

53:23.340 --> 53:26.420
You want to often copy other people's reasoning.

53:26.420 --> 53:28.180
Most of the time, and I, you know, most of us do it

53:28.180 --> 53:29.140
most of the time and that's good,

53:29.140 --> 53:30.260
but there's certain moments when you're,

53:30.260 --> 53:32.700
forget just for a second, like succeeding

53:32.700 --> 53:34.500
in like the world of like Elon,

53:34.500 --> 53:35.620
just who you're gonna marry,

53:35.620 --> 53:36.580
where are you gonna settle down?

53:36.580 --> 53:38.820
How are you gonna raise your kids?

53:38.820 --> 53:40.900
How are you gonna educate your kids?

53:40.900 --> 53:42.260
How you should educate yourself?

53:42.260 --> 53:43.740
What kind of career paths and turns?

53:43.740 --> 53:45.740
These moments, this is what on your deathbed,

53:45.740 --> 53:47.140
like you look back on and that's what,

53:47.140 --> 53:49.300
these are the few number of choices

53:49.300 --> 53:50.500
that really define your life.

53:50.500 --> 53:52.260
Those should not be reasoned by analogy.

53:52.260 --> 53:55.220
You should absolutely try to reason from first principles.

53:55.220 --> 53:58.340
And Elon, not just by the way in his work,

53:58.340 --> 53:59.340
but in his personal life.

53:59.340 --> 54:01.460
I mean, if you just look at the way he's on Twitter,

54:01.460 --> 54:03.380
it's not how you're supposed to be

54:03.380 --> 54:07.300
when you're a super famous, you know, industry titan.

54:07.300 --> 54:08.820
You're not supposed to just be silly on Twitter

54:08.820 --> 54:11.780
and do memes and getting little quibbles with you.

54:11.780 --> 54:14.260
He just does things his own way,

54:14.260 --> 54:15.820
regardless of what you're supposed to do,

54:15.820 --> 54:17.580
which sometimes serves him and sometimes doesn't,

54:17.580 --> 54:21.460
but I think it has taken him where it has taken him.

54:21.460 --> 54:23.340
Yeah, I mean, I probably wouldn't describe

54:23.340 --> 54:25.940
his approach to Twitter as first principles,

54:25.940 --> 54:26.780
but I guess it has the same.

54:26.780 --> 54:28.300
I don't think it is.

54:28.300 --> 54:30.020
First of all, I will say that a lot of tweets,

54:30.020 --> 54:32.500
people think, oh, like he's gonna be done after that.

54:32.500 --> 54:35.420
He's fine, he's just one man, time man of the year.

54:36.380 --> 54:38.500
Something is, it's not sinking him.

54:38.500 --> 54:40.580
And I think, you know, it's not that I think

54:40.580 --> 54:41.700
this is like super reasoned out.

54:41.700 --> 54:43.380
I think that, you know, Twitter is his silly side,

54:43.380 --> 54:48.220
but I think that he saw,

54:48.220 --> 54:50.740
his reasoning did not feel like there was a giant risk

54:50.740 --> 54:52.460
in just being his silly self on Twitter,

54:52.460 --> 54:53.540
when a lot of billionaires would say,

54:53.540 --> 54:55.500
well, no one else is doing that.

54:55.500 --> 54:58.140
So it must be a good reason, right?

54:58.140 --> 55:01.060
Well, I gotta say that he inspires me to,

55:01.060 --> 55:04.180
that it's okay to be silly on Twitter.

55:04.220 --> 55:06.660
And, but yeah, you're right.

55:06.660 --> 55:08.940
The big inspiration is the willingness to do that

55:08.940 --> 55:11.020
when nobody else is doing it.

55:11.020 --> 55:13.220
Yeah, and I think about all the great artists,

55:13.220 --> 55:16.220
you know, all the great inventors and entrepreneurs,

55:16.220 --> 55:18.420
almost all of them, they had a moment

55:18.420 --> 55:19.460
when they trusted their reasoning.

55:19.460 --> 55:24.460
I mean, Airbnb was 0 for 60 with VCs.

55:24.900 --> 55:25.780
A lot of people would say,

55:25.780 --> 55:28.940
obviously they know something we don't, right?

55:28.940 --> 55:30.660
But they didn't, they said, I think they're all wrong.

55:30.660 --> 55:32.940
I mean, that takes some kind of different wiring

55:32.940 --> 55:34.220
in your brain.

55:34.220 --> 55:36.420
And then that's both for big picture

55:36.420 --> 55:39.500
and detailed like engineering problems.

55:39.500 --> 55:40.740
It's fun to talk to him.

55:40.740 --> 55:42.140
It's fun to talk to Jim Keller,

55:42.140 --> 55:44.500
who's a good example of this kind of thinking

55:44.500 --> 55:47.540
about like manufacturing, how to get cost down.

55:47.540 --> 55:49.020
They always talk about like,

55:49.020 --> 55:52.180
they talk about SpaceX rockets this way.

55:52.180 --> 55:53.860
They talk about manufacturing this way,

55:53.860 --> 55:58.860
like cost per pound or per ton to get to orbit

56:01.180 --> 56:02.020
or something like that.

56:02.580 --> 56:04.660
This is all the reason we need to get the cost down.

56:04.660 --> 56:07.860
It's a very kind of raw materials,

56:07.860 --> 56:10.460
like just very basic way of thinking.

56:10.460 --> 56:11.700
First principles.

56:11.700 --> 56:13.020
It's really, yeah.

56:13.020 --> 56:14.460
And the first principles of a rocket are like

56:14.460 --> 56:18.420
the price of raw materials and gravity, you know,

56:18.420 --> 56:19.900
and wind.

56:19.900 --> 56:22.860
I mean, these are your first principles and fuel.

56:24.580 --> 56:29.220
Henry Ford, you know, what made Henry Ford blow up

56:29.220 --> 56:32.060
as an entrepreneur, the assembly line, right?

56:32.060 --> 56:35.180
I mean, he thought for a second and said,

56:35.180 --> 56:38.300
this isn't how manufacturing is normally done this way,

56:38.300 --> 56:40.660
but I think this is a different kind of product.

56:40.660 --> 56:41.980
And that's what changed it.

56:41.980 --> 56:43.620
And then what happens is when someone reasons

56:43.620 --> 56:45.260
from first principles, they often fail.

56:45.260 --> 56:47.660
You're going out into the fog

56:47.660 --> 56:49.340
with no conventional wisdom to guide you.

56:49.340 --> 56:51.180
But when you succeed, what you notice is that

56:51.180 --> 56:52.780
everyone else turns and says, wait, what?

56:52.780 --> 56:53.620
What are they doing?

56:53.620 --> 56:55.220
And then they all, they flock over.

56:55.220 --> 56:56.460
Look at the iPhone.

56:56.460 --> 56:58.060
iPhone, you know, Steve Jobs was obviously

56:58.060 --> 57:00.100
famously good at reasoning from first principles

57:00.100 --> 57:02.860
because that guy had crazy self-confidence.

57:02.860 --> 57:04.860
He just said, you know, if I think this is right,

57:04.860 --> 57:06.340
like everyone in that, I mean, I don't know how,

57:06.340 --> 57:07.540
I don't know how he does that.

57:07.540 --> 57:09.620
And I don't think Apple can do that anymore.

57:09.620 --> 57:10.460
I mean, they lost that.

57:10.460 --> 57:12.700
That one brain, his ability to do that

57:12.700 --> 57:14.820
was made that in a totally different company,

57:14.820 --> 57:17.300
even though there's tens of thousands of people there.

57:17.300 --> 57:19.100
He said, he didn't say,

57:19.100 --> 57:21.540
and I'm giving a lot of credit to Steve Jobs,

57:21.540 --> 57:23.820
but of course it was a team at Apple who said

57:23.820 --> 57:26.300
they didn't look at the flip phones and say,

57:26.300 --> 57:28.340
okay, what kind of, you know, let's make a keyboard

57:28.340 --> 57:29.380
that's like clicky and, you know,

57:29.380 --> 57:30.340
really cool Apple-y keyboard.

57:30.340 --> 57:32.700
They said, what should a mobile device be?

57:32.700 --> 57:35.660
You know, what the axioms, what are the axioms here?

57:35.660 --> 57:37.500
And none of them involved a keyboard necessarily.

57:37.500 --> 57:38.340
And by the time they piece it up,

57:38.340 --> 57:39.180
there was no keyboards.

57:39.180 --> 57:40.340
It didn't make sense.

57:40.340 --> 57:41.580
Everyone suddenly is going, wait, what?

57:41.580 --> 57:42.420
What are they doing?

57:42.420 --> 57:43.780
And now every phone looks like the iPhone.

57:43.780 --> 57:46.740
I mean, that's how it goes.

57:46.740 --> 57:51.380
You tweeted, what's something you've changed your mind about?

57:51.380 --> 57:53.540
That's the question you've tweeted.

57:53.540 --> 57:55.980
Elon replied, brain transplants.

57:55.980 --> 57:58.060
Sam Harris responded, nuclear power.

57:58.060 --> 58:01.460
There's a bunch of people with cool responses there.

58:01.460 --> 58:02.620
In general, what are your thoughts

58:02.620 --> 58:03.820
about some of the responses

58:03.820 --> 58:06.100
and what have you changed your mind about,

58:06.100 --> 58:08.780
big or small, perhaps in doing the research

58:08.780 --> 58:10.580
for some of your writing?

58:10.580 --> 58:13.820
So I'm writing right now, just finishing a book

58:13.820 --> 58:18.580
on kind of why our society is such a shit place

58:18.580 --> 58:20.220
at the moment, just polarized.

58:20.220 --> 58:21.860
And, you know, we have all these gifts,

58:21.860 --> 58:23.740
like we're talking about, just the supermarket.

58:23.740 --> 58:25.700
We have this exploding technology.

58:25.700 --> 58:28.060
Fewer and fewer people are in poverty.

58:28.060 --> 58:30.780
You know, as Louis C.K. likes to say,

58:30.780 --> 58:32.900
everything's amazing and no one's happy, right?

58:32.900 --> 58:35.020
But it's really extreme moment right now

58:35.020 --> 58:39.740
where it's like, hate is on the rise, like crazy things, right?

58:39.740 --> 58:41.100
If I could interrupt briefly,

58:41.100 --> 58:43.380
you did tweet that you just wrote the last word.

58:43.380 --> 58:44.340
I sure did.

58:44.340 --> 58:46.980
And then there's some hilarious asshole who said,

58:46.980 --> 58:49.900
now you just have to work on all the ones in the middle.

58:49.900 --> 58:50.740
Yeah, I heard that.

58:50.740 --> 58:52.980
I mean, when you earn a reputation

58:52.980 --> 58:55.820
as a tried and true procrastinator,

58:55.820 --> 58:58.500
you're just gonna get shit forever and that's fine.

58:58.500 --> 58:59.700
I accept my fate there.

58:59.700 --> 59:02.060
So do you mind sharing a little bit more

59:02.060 --> 59:03.780
about the details of what you're writing?

59:03.780 --> 59:07.860
So how do you approach this question

59:07.860 --> 59:09.260
about the state of society?

59:09.260 --> 59:11.780
I wanted to figure out what was going on

59:11.780 --> 59:15.100
because what I noticed was a bad trend.

59:15.100 --> 59:16.460
It's not that, you know, things are bad.

59:16.460 --> 59:19.420
It's that things are getting worse in certain ways.

59:19.420 --> 59:20.260
Not in every way.

59:20.260 --> 59:21.820
And if you look at Max Roser's stuff,

59:22.980 --> 59:24.940
you know, he comes up with all these amazing graphs.

59:24.940 --> 59:27.420
This is what's weird is that things are getting better

59:27.420 --> 59:29.940
in almost every important metric you can think of.

59:31.620 --> 59:35.300
Except the amount of people who hate other people

59:35.300 --> 59:36.700
in their own country

59:36.700 --> 59:40.020
and the amount of people that hate their own country,

59:40.020 --> 59:42.860
the amount of Americans that hate America is on the rise.

59:42.860 --> 59:45.620
The amount of Americans that hate other Americans

59:45.620 --> 59:47.180
is on the rise.

59:47.180 --> 59:49.180
The amount of Americans that hate the president

59:49.980 --> 59:50.820
is on the rise, all these things.

59:50.820 --> 59:52.820
Like on the very steep rise.

59:52.820 --> 59:53.740
So what the hell?

59:53.740 --> 59:54.580
What's going on?

59:54.580 --> 59:56.180
Like there's something causing that.

59:56.180 --> 59:58.340
It's not that, you know, a bunch of new people were born

59:58.340 --> 59:59.300
who were just dicks.

59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.340
It's that something is going on.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.140
So I think of it as a very simple,

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:07.940
oversimplified equation, human behavior.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.900
And it's the output.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.020
That I think the two inputs are human nature

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.140
and environment, right?

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.140
And this is basic, you know, super kindergarten level,

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:18.460
like, you know, animal behavior.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.140
But I think it's worth thinking about.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.300
You've got human nature,

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:24.060
which is not changing very much, right?

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.620
And then you got, you throw that nature

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.060
into a certain environment

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.860
and it reacts to the environment, right?

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.580
It's shaped by the environment.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.500
And then eventually what comes out is behavior, right?

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.060
Human nature is not changing very much,

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.340
but suddenly we're behaving differently, right?

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.620
We are, again, you know, look at the polls.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.180
Like it used to be that the president, you know,

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.100
was liked by, I don't remember the exact numbers,

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.140
80% or 70% of their own party

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.940
and, you know, 50% of the other party.

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.580
And now it's like 40% of their own party

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:56.100
and 10% of the other party, you know?

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.300
And it's not that the presidents are getting worse,

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.660
maybe some people would argue that they are,

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.900
but more so, and there's a lot of, you know,

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.620
idiot presidents throughout the,

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.220
what's going on is something in the environment is changing

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.180
and that you're seeing is a change in behavior.

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:12.780
A easy example here is that, you know,

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:16.340
by a lot of metrics, racism is getting,

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.300
is becoming less and less of a problem.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.020
You know, this is hard to measure,

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:21.980
but there's metrics like, you know,

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.020
how upset would you be if your kid

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:26.540
married someone of another race?

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.020
And that number is plummeting,

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:30.820
but racial grievance is skyrocketing, right?

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.020
There's a lot of examples like this.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.620
So I wanted to look around and say,

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.700
and the reason I took it on,

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.820
the reason I don't think this is just an unfortunate trend,

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.860
unpleasant trend that hopefully we come out of

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:40.460
is that all this other stuff I like to write about,

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.980
all this future stuff, right?

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:42.820
And is this magical?

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.740
I always think of this,

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.260
I'm very optimistic in a lot of ways

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.500
and I think that our world would be a utopia,

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.180
would seem like actual heaven.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.700
Like whatever Thomas Jefferson was picturing as heaven,

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:55.460
other than maybe the eternal life aspect,

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:59.220
I think that if he came to 2021 US, it would be better.

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.940
It's cooler than heaven.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.860
What we live in a place that's cooler than 1700's heaven.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.660
Again, other than the fact that we still die.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.260
Now, I think that future world

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.660
actually probably would have, quote, eternal life.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:11.980
I don't think anyone wants eternal life, actually,

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.340
if people think they do.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.580
Eternal is a long time.

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.940
But I think the choice to die when you want,

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:19.420
maybe we're uploaded, maybe we can refresh our bodies,

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:20.260
I don't know what it is.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.420
But the point is, I think about that utopia

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.940
and I do believe that if we don't botch this,

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.140
we'd be heading towards somewhere

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.060
that would seem like heaven, maybe in our lifetimes.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.940
Of course, if things go wrong,

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.900
now think about the trends here.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.980
Just like the 20th century would seem like

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.780
some magical utopia to someone from the 16th century,

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:43.860
the bad things in the 20th century

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:46.140
were kind of the worst things ever

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.980
in terms of just absolute magnitude.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:52.060
World War II, the biggest genocides ever.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.060
You've got maybe climate change,

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:58.380
if it is the existential threat that many will think it is.

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.060
We never had an existential threat on that level before.

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.020
So the good is getting better and the bad's getting worse.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.420
And so what I think about the future,

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:10.420
I think of us as some kind of big, long canoe as a species.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.940
Five million mile long canoe, each of us sitting in a row

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:16.820
and we each have one oar and we can paddle

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.540
on the left side or the right side.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.980
And what we know is there's a fork up there somewhere.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:26.020
And the river forks and there's a utopia on one side

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.220
and a dystopia on the other side.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.300
And I really believe that we're probably not headed

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.460
for just an okay future.

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.540
It's just the way tech is exploding,

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.260
it's probably gonna be really good or really bad.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.820
The question is, which side should we be rowing on?

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.740
We can't see up there, right?

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.580
But it really matters.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.620
So I'm running about with this future stuff

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:40.660
and I'm saying, none of this matters

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:42.020
if we're squabbling our way

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.420
into kind of like a civil war right now.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.740
So what's going on?

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.580
So it's a really important problem to solve.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:51.860
What are your sources of hope in this?

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.940
So like, how do you steer the canoe?

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:56.300
One of my big sources of hope,

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.860
and this is I think my answer to what I changed my mind on

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:03.700
is I think I always knew this, but it's easy to forget it.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.580
Our primitive brain does not remember this fact,

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:10.300
which is that I don't think there are very many bad people.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:13.580
Now, when you say bad, are there selfish people?

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.340
Most of us, I think that if you think of people,

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:21.620
there's digital languages, ones and zeros.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.220
And our primitive brain very quickly

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.020
can get into the land where everyone's a one or a zero.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.900
Our tribe, we're all ones, we're perfect.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.820
I'm perfect, my family is that other family,

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.340
it's that other tribe, there are zeros.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.820
And then you dehumanize them, right?

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:33.940
These people are awful.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.180
So zero was not a human place.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.380
No one's a zero and no one's a one.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.260
Those are, you're dehumanizing yourself.

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.100
So when we get into this land,

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.700
I call it political Disney world,

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.780
because the Disney movies have good guys,

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:48.260
Scar is totally bad and Mufasa is totally good, right?

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.380
There's no, you don't see Mufasa's character flaws.

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:52.980
You don't see Scar's upbringing that made him like that,

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.540
that humanizes, no, lionizes him, whatever.

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.820
You are-

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.660
Well done.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:01.820
Yeah, Mufasa's a one and Scar's a zero, very simple.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.700
So political Disney world is a place,

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.700
it's a psychological place that all of us have been in.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.220
And it can be religious Disney world,

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:11.020
it can be national Disney world and war, whatever it is.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.380
But it's a place where we fall into this delusion

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.900
that there are protagonists and antagonists

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.740
and that's it, right?

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:16.980
That is not true.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.940
We are all 0.5s or maybe 0.6s to 0.4s in that.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.340
We are also, on one hand,

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.460
I don't think there's that many really great people,

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.220
frankly, I think if you get into it,

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.820
people are kind of, a lot of people,

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.540
most of us have, if you get really

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.180
into our most shameful memories,

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.420
the things we've done that are worse,

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:33.460
the most shameful thoughts,

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.100
the deep selfishness that some of us have

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:37.100
in areas we wouldn't want to admit, right?

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.580
Most of us have a lot of unadmirable stuff, right?

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.500
On the other hand, if you actually got into,

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.260
really got into someone else's brain

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.340
and you looked at their upbringing,

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.140
you looked at the trauma that they've experienced,

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.460
and then you looked at the insecurities they have

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.300
and you look at all their,

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.620
if you assemble the highlight reel of your worst moments,

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.540
the meanest things you've ever done,

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.660
the worst, the most selfish,

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.460
the times you stole something, whatever,

01:05:58.460 --> 01:05:59.300
and you just have, people are like,

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:00.980
wow, Lex is an awful person.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.580
If you did a montage of your best moments,

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:04.980
people would say, oh, he's a god, right?

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.780
But of course, we all have both of those.

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.500
So, I've started to really try to remind myself

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.700
that everyone's a .5, right?

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.860
And .5s are all worthy of criticism

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.700
and we're all worthy of compassion.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.860
And the thing that makes me hopeful

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:22.660
is that I really think that there's a bunch of .5s

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.700
and .5s are good enough

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.500
that we should be able to create a good society together.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.060
There's a lot of love in every human.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:30.620
And I think there's more love in humans than hate.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:34.340
Yeah, I always remember this moment.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.940
This is weird anecdote, but I was at,

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.020
I'm a Red Sox fan, Boston Red Sox baseball.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.420
And Derek Jeter is who we hate the most.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.340
He's on the Yankees.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.380
Yes.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.700
And hate, right?

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:45.820
Jeter, right?

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.940
He was his last game in Fenway, he's retiring.

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.780
And he got this rousing standing ovation

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:50.940
and I almost cried.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.500
And it was like, what is going on?

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.320
We hate this guy,

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.100
but actually there's so much love in all humans.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.660
It felt so good to just give a huge cheer

01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.500
to this guy we hate

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.020
because it's like this moment of like a little fist pound

01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:04.060
being like, of course we all actually love each other.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.220
And I think there's so much of that.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.100
And so the thing that I think I've come around on

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.180
is I think that we are in an environment

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.260
that's bringing out really bad stuff.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.820
I don't think it's, if I thought it was the people,

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.660
I would be more hopeful.

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:17.660
Like if I thought it was human nature,

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.740
I'd be more upset.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:23.140
It's the two independent variables here,

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.500
or there's a fixed variable.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.860
There's a constant, which is the human nature.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.700
And there's the independent variable environment

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.500
and that behavior is the dependent variable.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:32.380
I like that the thing that I think is bad

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.580
is the independent variable, the environment,

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:36.900
which means I think we can, the environment can get better.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.080
And there's a lot of things I can go into

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.840
about why the environment I think is bad.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.180
But I have hope,

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:42.780
because I think the thing that's bad for us

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.540
is something that can change.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.740
The first principles idea here

01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.340
is that most people have the capacity

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.660
to be a 0.7 to 0.9

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:56.660
if the environment is properly calibrated

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:57.980
with the right incentives.

01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:58.820
I think that, well, I think that,

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:01.700
I think maybe if we're all, yeah, if we're all 0.5s,

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:05.540
I think that environments can bring out our good side.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.940
Yes, if maybe we're all on some kind of distribution

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:11.020
and the right environment can, yes,

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.780
can bring out our higher sides.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:14.420
And I think a lot of, in a lot of ways,

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:15.260
you could say it has.

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:18.900
I mean, the US environment, we take for granted

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:23.060
the liberal laws and liberal environment that we live in.

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.280
I mean, like in New York City, right?

01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.420
If you walk down the street and you like assault someone,

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.980
A, if anyone sees you, they're probably gonna yell it.

01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:32.960
You might get your ass kicked by someone for doing that.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.660
You also might end up in jail, you know,

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.100
if it's security cameras and there's just norms.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:38.940
You know, we're all trained.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.380
That's what awful people do, right?

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.260
So there's, it's not the human nature

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.320
doesn't have it in it to be like that.

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.140
It's that this environment we're in

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.180
has made that a much, much, much smaller experience

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.140
for people.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.940
There's so many examples like that where it's like,

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.500
man, you don't realize how much of the worst human nature

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.220
is contained by our environment.

01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:58.780
And, but I think that, you know,

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.220
rapidly changing environment,

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:02.260
which is what we have right now, social media starts.

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.700
I mean, what a seismic change to the environment.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.780
There's a lot of examples like that.

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.900
Rapidly changing environment

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.240
can create rapidly changing behavior

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.700
and wisdom sometimes can't keep up.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:15.820
And so we, you know, we can really kind of lose our grip

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:17.340
on some of the good behavior.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:19.380
Were you surprised by Elon's answer

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.340
about brain transplants or Sam's about nuclear power

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.820
or anything else just-

01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:28.820
Sam's I think is, I have a friend, Isabel Bomeque,

01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:33.160
who has a, who's a nuclear power influencer.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.940
I've become very convinced

01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:37.980
and I've not done my deep dive on this,

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:39.940
but here's, in this case, this is,

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:41.700
this is reasoning by analogy here.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:45.140
The amount of really smart people I respect

01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:46.980
who seem to have dug in,

01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:50.020
who all say nuclear power is clearly a good option.

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.140
It's obviously emission free,

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.140
but you know, the concerns about meltdowns and waste,

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.860
they see that they're completely overblown.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:00.260
So judging from those people, secondary knowledge here,

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.740
I will say I'm a strong advocate.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.220
I haven't done my own deep dive yet,

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:06.540
but it does seem like a little bit odd

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:09.220
that you've got people who are so concerned

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.700
about climate change, who have,

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.340
it seems like it's kind of an ideology

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.220
where nuclear power doesn't fit,

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:20.380
rather than rational fear of climate change

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.260
that somehow is anti-nuclear power.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.260
It just, yeah.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.860
I personally am uncomfortably reasoning

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.980
by analogy with climate change.

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:29.780
I've actually have not done a deep dive myself.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.860
Me neither, because it's so,

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.380
man, it seems like a deep dive.

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:34.780
Yeah.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.300
And my reasoning by analogy there

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.660
currently has me thinking it's a truly existential thing,

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:41.900
but feeling hopeful.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.420
So let me, this is me speaking,

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.780
and this is speaking from a person

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.220
who's not done the deep dive.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.540
I'm a little suspicious

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.700
of the amount of fear-mongering going on.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.780
I've, especially over the past couple of years,

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.700
I've gotten uncomfortable with fear-mongering

01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.180
in all walks of life.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.580
There's way too many people interested

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.300
in manipulating the populace with fear.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.500
And so I don't like it.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.940
I should probably do a deep dive,

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.860
because to me it's at the, well,

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:13.180
the big problem with opposition to climate change

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.180
or whatever the fear-mongering is

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.780
that it also grows the skepticism in science broadly.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.980
It's like, and that,

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.500
so I need to make sure I do that deep dive.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.180
I have listened to a few folks

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.860
who kind of criticize the fear-mongering

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:29.180
and all those kinds of things,

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.860
but they're few and far in between.

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:33.820
And so it's like, all right, what is the truth here?

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.340
And it feels lazy,

01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:38.540
but it also feels like it's hard to get to the,

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:43.100
there's a lot of kind of activists talking about idea

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:48.100
versus like sources of objective,

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.500
like calm first principles type reasoning.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.140
Like one of the things,

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.920
I know it's supposed to be a very big problem,

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.060
but when people talk about catastrophic effects

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.740
of climate change,

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:06.380
I haven't been able to see really great deep analysis

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.500
of what that looks like in 10, 20, 30 years,

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.420
raising, rising sea levels.

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:17.020
What are the models of how that changes human behavior,

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.300
society, what are the things that happen?

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.660
There's going to be constraints on the resources

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.380
and people are gonna have to move around.

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.940
This is happening gradually.

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:26.740
Are we gonna be able to respond to this?

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:27.860
How would we respond to this?

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:28.980
What are the best,

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.460
like what are the best models

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.340
for how everything goes wrong?

01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:34.980
Again, I was, this is a question

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.300
that I keep starting to ask myself

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.300
without doing any research,

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.500
like motivating myself to get up to this deep dive

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.140
that I feel is deep,

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:47.260
just watching people not do a great job

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:49.540
with that kind of modeling with the pandemic

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:52.700
and sort of being caught off guard and wondering,

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.220
okay, if we're not good with this pandemic,

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.620
how are we going to respond to other kinds of tragedies?

01:12:57.620 --> 01:12:59.500
Well, so this is part of why I wrote the book

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.380
because I said,

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:04.300
we're going to have more and more of these,

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:08.180
big collective, what should we do here situations,

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:09.700
whether it's how about when,

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.900
we're probably not that far away from people being able to

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.500
go and decide the IQ of their kid

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.940
or like make a bunch of embryos

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.620
and actually pick the highest IQ.

01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.340
Can possibly go wrong.

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:22.940
And also like imagine the political sides of that

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:25.420
and like something only wealthy people can afford at first

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.300
and just the nightmare, right?

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.580
We need to be able to have our wits about us as a species

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.820
where we can actually get into a topic like that

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.060
and come up with,

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:36.700
where the collective brain can be smart.

01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:39.380
I think that there are certain topics

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.260
where I think of this and this is again,

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.100
another simplistic model, but I think it works

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.180
is that there's a higher mind and a primitive mind, right?

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:47.220
You can, you know, in your head

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.900
and these team up with others.

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.100
So when the higher minds are,

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.940
in a higher mind is more rational

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.020
and puts out ideas that it's not attached to.

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:56.420
And so it can, it can change its mind easily

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.260
because it's just an idea

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.380
and the higher mind can get criticized.

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.900
Their ideas can get criticized and it's no big deal.

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:05.020
And so when the higher minds team up,

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.500
it's like all these people in the room,

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.900
like throwing out ideas and kicking them.

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.020
And one idea goes out and everyone criticizes it,

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.780
which is like, you know, shooting bows and arrows at it.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.780
And the truth, the true idea is,

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:15.820
you know, the arrows bounce off and it's so,

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:18.300
okay, it rises up and the other ones get shot down.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.540
So it's this incredible system.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.380
This is what, you know,

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.540
this is what good science institution is,

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.020
is, you know, someone puts out a thing,

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:26.260
criticism arrows come at it and, you know,

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.060
most of them fall and the needle is in the haystack

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.060
end up rising up, right?

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.460
So what that's happening is a bunch of people,

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.780
a bunch of flawed medium scientists

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.460
are creating super intelligence.

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.460
Then there's the primitive mind,

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:43.580
which, you know, is the more limbic systemy part

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.420
of our brain.

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.020
It's the, it's a part of us that is very much

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.700
not living in 2021.

01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:51.420
It's living many tens of thousands of years ago.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.140
And it does not treat ideas like this separate thing.

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.420
It identifies with its ideas.

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:59.900
It only gets involved when it finds an idea sacred.

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.060
It starts holding an idea sacred and it starts identifying.

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:04.340
So what happens is they team up too.

01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:08.340
And so when you have a topic that a bunch of primitive,

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.540
that really rouses a bunch of primitive minds,

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.940
it quickly, the primitive minds team up

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.660
and they create an echo chamber

01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.460
where suddenly no one can criticize this.

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:20.700
And in fact, if the idea is powerful enough,

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:22.100
people outside the community, you can,

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:22.940
no one can criticize it.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.020
We will get your paper retracted.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.820
We will get you fired, right?

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.100
That's not higher mind behavior.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.580
That is crazy primitive mind.

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.260
And so now what happens is the collective becomes dumber

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.620
than an individual.

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.940
A dumber than a reason, a single reasoning individual.

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:37.140
You have this collective is suddenly attached

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:40.780
to this sacred scripture with the idea

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.220
and they will not change their mind

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:44.300
and they get dumber and dumber.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:47.300
And so climate change, what's worrisome

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.540
is that climate change has in many ways

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.980
become a sacred topic.

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:52.580
Where if you come up with a nuanced thing,

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.660
you might get called branded a denier.

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:57.700
So there goes the, there goes the super intelligence,

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:59.500
all the arrows, no arrows can be fired.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:01.020
But if you get called a denier,

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.460
that's a social penalty for firing an arrow

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.100
at a certain orthodoxy, right?

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.980
And so what's happening is the big brain gets frozen, right?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:08.900
And it becomes very stupid.

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:10.500
Now, you can also say that

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.540
about a lot of other topics right now.

01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.580
You just mentioned another one, I forget what it was,

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.020
but that's also kind of like this.

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.300
The world of vaccine.

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.540
Yeah, yeah, COVID, okay.

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.860
And here's my point earlier is that what I see

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.900
is that the political divide is like a whirlpool

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.340
that's pulling everything into it.

01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:29.780
And in that whirlpool,

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.860
thinking is done with the primitive mind tribes.

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:38.500
And so I get, okay, obviously something like race, right?

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.260
That makes sense, that also right now,

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.180
the topic of race, for example, or gender,

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.860
these things are in the whirlpool.

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:45.700
But that at least is like, okay,

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.100
that's something that the primitive mind

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:49.180
would always get really worked up about.

01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:52.300
It taps into like our deepest kind of like primal selves.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:56.060
COVID, maybe it's COVID in a way too,

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:57.260
but climate change,

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:58.100
like that should just be something

01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:58.940
that our rational brains are like,

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.380
let's solve this complex problem.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.420
But the problem is that it's all gotten sucked

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.300
into the red versus blue whirlpool.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.140
And once that happens,

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.340
it's in the hands of the primitive minds.

01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:09.220
And we're losing our ability to be wise together,

01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.700
to make decisions.

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.380
It's like the big species brain is like,

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.860
or the big American brain is like drunk at the wheel

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:16.700
right now.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.180
And we're about to go into a future

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:21.180
with more and more big technologies,

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:24.180
scary things, we have to make big right decisions.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.100
We're getting dumber as a collective

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.500
and that's part of this environmental problem.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.380
So within the space of technologists

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:31.660
and the space of scientists,

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.380
we should allow the arrows.

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:36.220
That's one of the saddest things to me about is like,

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:40.020
the scientists, like I've seen arrogance,

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.500
there's a lot of mechanisms that maintain the tribe.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.740
It's the arrogance,

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:47.980
it's how you built up this mechanism that defends,

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.140
this wall that defends against the arrows.

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:54.340
It's arrogance, credentialism,

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:58.100
like just ego, really.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.620
And then just, it protects you

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.020
from actually challenging your own ideas.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:05.540
This ideal of science that makes science beautiful

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:08.260
in a time of fear.

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:11.620
And in a time of division created by perhaps politicians

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:12.940
that leverage the fear,

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:16.260
it, like you said, makes the whole system dumber.

01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.900
The science system dumber,

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:22.740
the tech developer system dumber,

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.060
if they don't allow the challenging of ideas.

01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:27.340
What's really bad is that like,

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.620
in a normal environment,

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.580
you're always gonna have echo chambers.

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:32.380
So what's the opposite of an echo chamber?

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.140
I created a term for it because I think we need it,

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:35.700
which is called an idea lab.

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.540
An idea lab, right?

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:37.700
It's like people treat,

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.940
it's like people act like scientists,

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.500
even if they're not doing science,

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.420
they just treat their ideas like science experiments

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:45.380
and they toss them out there and everyone disagrees.

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:46.940
And disagreement is like the game.

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.220
Everyone likes to disagree on a certain text thread

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.860
where everyone is just saying,

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.260
it's almost like someone throws something out

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.100
and just as an impulse for the rest of the group to say,

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.620
oh, I think you're being overly general there.

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.340
Or I think like, aren't you kind of being,

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:00.180
I think that's like your bias showing.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.620
And it's like, no one's getting offended

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:02.780
because it's like, we're all just messing,

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.860
we all of course respect each other, obviously.

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:08.460
We're just trashing each other's ideas

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.660
and that the whole group becomes smarter.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:11.980
You're always gonna have idea labs

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:12.820
and echo chambers, right?

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:13.660
In different communities.

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.220
And most of us participate in both of them.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.060
Maybe in your marriage is a great idea lab.

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.060
You love to disagree with your spouse.

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.220
But this group of friends or your family at home,

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.420
you know in front of that sister,

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.660
you do not bring up politics

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.580
because she's now enforced when that happens,

01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.300
her bullying is forcing the whole room

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:32.900
to be an echo chamber to appease her.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.380
Now, what scares me is that

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.940
usually you have these things existing kind of in bubbles

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:40.060
and usually they each have their natural defenses

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:40.900
against each other.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:44.260
So an echo chamber person stays in their echo chamber.

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.740
They will cut you out.

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:47.300
They don't like to be friends with people

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.140
who disagree with them.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.180
You notice that, they will cut you out.

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:50.260
They'll cut out their parents

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.620
if they voted for Trump or whatever, right?

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.460
So that's how they do it.

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.060
They will say, I'm gonna stay inside

01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.180
of an echo chamber safely.

01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:59.420
So my ideas, which I identify with,

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.460
because my primitive mind is doing the thinking,

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.100
are not gonna ever have to get challenged

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.380
because it feels so scary and awful for that to happen.

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:09.900
But if they leave and they go into an idea lab environment,

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:10.740
people are gonna say, what?

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:11.820
No, they're gonna disagree.

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:12.660
And they're gonna say,

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:13.740
and the person is gonna try to bully them.

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:15.660
They're gonna say, that's really offensive.

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.460
And people are gonna say, no, it's not.

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:18.300
And they're gonna immediately say,

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:19.140
these people are assholes, right?

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:21.940
So the echo chamber person,

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.620
it doesn't have much power once they leave the echo chamber.

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.140
Likewise, the idea lab person,

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.260
they have this great environment,

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:28.580
but if they go into an echo chamber

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.980
where everyone else is, and they do that,

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.980
they'll get kicked out of the group.

01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:32.460
They'll get branded as something,

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:36.660
a denier, a racist, a right-winger, a radical,

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:38.240
these nasty words.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.460
The thing that I don't like right now

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:44.740
is that the echo chambers have found ways

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:48.420
to forcefully expand into places

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:51.260
that normally have a pretty good immune system

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.420
against echo chambers, like universities,

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.020
like science journals, places where usually

01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:58.060
it's like there's a strong idea lab culture,

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:02.660
they're veritas, that's an idea lab slogan.

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:06.100
You have is that these people have found a way to,

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:07.820
a lot of people have found a way

01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:10.180
to actually go out of their thing and keep their echo chamber

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.900
by making sure that everyone is scared

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:12.980
because they can punish anyone,

01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:15.020
whether you're in their community or not.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.140
That's all brilliantly put.

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:20.740
When's the book coming out?

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:21.580
Any idea?

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.980
June, July, we're not quite sure yet.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.380
Okay, I can't wait.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.200
Thanks.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:27.040
It's awesome.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.140
Do you have a title yet or you can't talk about that?

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:28.980
Still working on it.

01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:30.540
Okay.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.940
If it's okay, just a couple of questions from Mailbag,

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:34.260
I just love these.

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:37.460
I would love to hear you riff on these.

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.580
So one is about film and music.

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.960
Why do we prefer to watch, the question goes,

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.600
why do we prefer to watch a film we haven't watched before

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.600
but we want to listen to songs

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.120
that we have heard hundreds of times?

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:52.360
This question and your answer really started

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.480
to make me think like, yeah, that's true.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:55.800
That's really interesting.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.120
Like we draw that line somehow.

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.280
So what's the answer?

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.740
So I think, let's use these two minds again.

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.960
I think that when your higher mind is the one

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.240
who's taking something in and they're really interested,

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.080
you know, what are the lyrics?

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.840
Or I'm gonna learn something or what,

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.520
you know, reading a book or whatever

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:15.840
and the higher mind is trying to get information.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:16.960
And once it has it, there's no point

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:17.920
in listening to it again.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.800
It has the information.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.200
You know, your rational brain is like, I got it.

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:27.440
But when you eat a good meal or have sex or whatever,

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.780
that's something you can do again and again

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.720
because it actually, your primitive brain loves it, right?

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:35.360
And it never gets bored of things that it loves.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.120
So I think music is a very primal thing.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.760
I think music goes right into our primitive brain a lot,

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.800
you know, I think it's, of course,

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.920
it's a collaboration.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.940
You know, your rational brain is absorbing

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:47.520
the actual message.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.960
But I think it's all about emotions

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.080
and even more than emotions.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.420
It literally, like the music taps into like some very,

01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:58.420
very deep, you know, primal part of us.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.080
And so when you hear a song once,

01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.280
even some of your favorite songs,

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.320
the first time you heard it, you were like,

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.860
I guess that's kind of catchy.

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.320
Yeah.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.240
And then you end up loving it on the 10th listen,

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.600
but sometimes you even don't even like a song.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.520
You're like, oh, this song sucks.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.240
But you suddenly, you find yourself on the 40th time,

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.240
because it's on the radio all the time,

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.400
just kind of being like, oh, I love this song.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.720
And you're like, wait, I don't, I hated this song.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.040
And what's happening is that the sound is actually,

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.200
the music is actually carving a pathway in your brain.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.140
And it's a dance.

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.960
And when your brain knows what's coming,

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.080
it can dance, it knows the steps.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.760
So your brain is your internal kind of,

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.540
your brain is actually dancing with the music

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.720
and it knows the steps and it can anticipate

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:45.080
and so there's something about knowing,

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.560
having memorized the song that makes it

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:48.960
incredibly enjoyable to us.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.000
But when we hear it for the first time,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:50.840
we don't know where it's gonna go.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.680
We're like an awkward dancer.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.400
We don't know the steps and your primitive brain

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.280
can't really have that much fun yet.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.120
That's how I feel.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.840
And in the movies, that's more, that's less primitive.

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.680
That's the story you're taking in.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.720
But a really good movie that we really love,

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.560
often we watch it like 12 times, you know,

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.240
it's still like it, you know, not that many,

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:11.880
but versus if you're watching a talk show, right?

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.200
Listening to, if you're listening to one of your podcasts,

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.920
as a perfect example, there's not many people

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.760
that will listen to one of your podcasts,

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.080
no matter how good it is 12 times.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.400
Because it's, once you've got it, you got it.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.360
It's a form of information that's very higher mind focused.

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:26.200
That's how I feel.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:28.760
Well, you know, the funny thing is there is people

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:32.240
that listen to a podcast episode many, many times

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.020
and often I think the reason for that

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:36.160
is not because the information is the chemistry,

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.120
is the music of the conversation.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:38.960
So it's not the actual-

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.320
It's just the art of it, they like.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.400
Yeah, they'll fall in love with some kind of person,

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.360
some weird personality and they'll just be listening to,

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.840
they'll be captivated by the beat of that kind of person.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.680
Or like a standup comic,

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.320
I've watched like certain things like episodes,

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.320
like 20 times, even though I, you know.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.480
I have to ask you about the wizard hat.

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.120
You're on a blog about Neuralink.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.560
I got a chance to visit Neuralink a couple of times,

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.960
hanging out with those folks.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.560
That was one of the pieces of writing you did

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.320
that like changes culture

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.080
and changes the way people think about a thing.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.920
The ridiculousness of your stick figure drawings

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.520
are somehow, it's like, you know,

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.360
it's like calling the origin of the universe the Big Bang.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.880
It's a silly title, but it somehow sticks

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.000
to be the representative of that.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.440
And the same way the wizard hat for the Neuralink is,

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.480
somehow it was a really powerful way to explain that.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.200
You actually proposed that the Man of the Year cover

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.760
of Time should be-

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.600
One of my drawings.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.440
One of your drawings.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.280
In general, yeah.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280
This is an outrage that it wasn't.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.200
It wasn't.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:48.120
Okay, so what are your thoughts about

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.360
like all those years later about Neuralink?

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.680
What would, do you find this idea,

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.240
like what excites you about?

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:56.880
Is it the big long-term philosophical things?

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.360
Is it the practical things?

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.600
Do you think it's super difficult to do

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.160
on the neurosurgery side

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:05.160
and the material engineering, the robotics side?

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.240
Or do you think the machine learning side

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.560
for the brain-computer interfaces,

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.280
where they get to learn about each other,

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.120
all that kind of stuff.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.360
I would just love to get your thoughts

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.280
because you're one of the people

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.120
that really considered this problem, really studied it,

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.680
on brain-computer interfaces.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.800
I mean, I'm super excited about it.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:24.840
It's a, I really think it's actually

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.760
Elon's most ambitious thing, more than colonizing Mars,

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.200
because that's just a bunch of people going somewhere,

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.160
even though it's somewhere far.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.680
Neuralink is changing what a person is, eventually.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.440
Now, I think that Neuralink engineers

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.000
and Elon himself would all be the first to admit

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.920
that it is a maybe, whether they can do their goals here.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.280
I mean, it is so crazy ambitious to try to,

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.280
you know, their eventual goals are, you know,

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.040
of course in the interim,

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.120
they have a higher probability

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.160
of accomplishing smaller things, which are still huge,

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:01.160
like basically solving paralysis, you know,

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:02.600
strokes, Parkinson, things like that.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.000
I mean, it can be unbelievable.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.360
And, you know, anyone who doesn't have one of these things,

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.400
like we might, you know,

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.880
everyone should be very happy

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.760
about this kind of helping with different disabilities.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:19.920
But the thing that is like, so the grand goal

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.320
is this augmentation where it's,

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.600
you take someone who's totally healthy

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.240
and you put a brain-machine interface in any way

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.720
to give them superpowers.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.280
I, you know, it's the possibilities if they can do this,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.480
so, you know, they've already shown that they are for real,

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:38.560
with, you know, they've created this robot.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.640
Elon talks about like, it should be like LASIK,

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.000
where it's not,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.200
it shouldn't be something that needs a surgeon.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.480
This shouldn't just be for rich people

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.160
who have waited in line for six months.

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.240
It should be for anyone who can afford LASIK

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:51.720
and eventually, hopefully,

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:54.080
something that isn't covered by insurance

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.320
or, you know, something that anyone can do.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.760
Something this big a deal should be something

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.160
that anyone can afford eventually.

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.160
And when we have this, again,

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.720
I'm talking about a very advanced phase down the road.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:08.080
So maybe a less advanced phase, just to,

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:11.000
maybe right now,

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.280
if you think about when you listen to a song,

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:16.760
what's happening, is do you actually hear the sound?

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.600
Well, not really.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.280
It's that the sound is coming out of the speaker.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.520
The speaker is vibrating.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.080
It's vibrating air molecules.

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.800
Those air molecules, you know,

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.880
get vibrated all the way to your head.

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.760
Pressure wave.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.520
And then it vibrates your eardrum.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.080
Your eardrum is really the speaker now in your head

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:40.360
that then vibrates bones and fluid,

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:44.880
which then stimulates neurons in your auditory cortex,

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.840
which give you the perception that you're hearing sound.

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.280
Now, if you think about that,

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.160
do we really need to have a speaker to do that?

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.120
You could just somehow,

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.960
if you had a little tiny thing that could vibrate eardrums,

01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.320
you could do it that way.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.920
That seems very hard,

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:03.280
but really what you need is to go to the very end

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:05.040
where the thing that really needs to happen

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.120
is your auditory cortex neurons

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.680
need to be stimulated in a certain way.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.960
If you have a ton of Neuralink things in there,

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:13.360
Neuralink electrodes,

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.960
and they get really good at stimulating things,

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.760
you could play a song in your head that you hear

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.520
that is not playing anywhere.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.920
There's no sound in the room,

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.760
but you hear it and no one else could.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.280
It's not like they can get close to your head and hear it.

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.120
There's no sound.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:28.360
They could not hear anything, but you hear sound.

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.320
So you open your phone, you have the Neuralink app.

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.640
You open the Neuralink app,

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.080
and it's just Neuralink.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.600
So basically you can open your Spotify

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.800
and you can play to your speaker,

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:39.680
you can play to your computer,

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.240
you can play right out of your phone to your headphones,

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:43.400
or you can now have a new one.

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.680
You can play into your brain.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:47.160
And this is one of the earlier things.

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.800
This is something that seems like really doable.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.280
So no more headphones.

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.280
I always think it's so annoying

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.880
because I can leave the house with just my phone

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.600
and nothing else.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.440
You can just have Apple Watch,

01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.280
but there's always this one thing.

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.120
I'm like, and headphones.

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.440
You do need your headphones, right?

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.080
So I feel like that'll be the end of that.

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.280
But there's so many things that you keep going.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.560
The ability to think together.

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.320
You can talk about like super brains.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.760
I mean, one of the examples Elon uses

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:16.040
is the low bandwidth of speech.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:19.360
If I go to a movie and I come out of a scary movie

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.200
and you say, how was it?

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.160
I said, oh, it was terrifying.

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.960
Well, what did I just do?

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.440
I just gave you five buckets I could have given you.

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:29.480
One was horrifying, terrifying, scary, eerie, creepy,

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.640
whatever.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.880
That's about it.

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:36.240
And I had a much more nuanced experience than that.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:39.560
And all I have is these words, right?

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.920
And so instead I just hand you the bucket.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.240
I put the stuff in the bucket and give it to you,

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.440
but all you have is the bucket.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.720
You just have to guess what I put into that bucket.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.240
All you can do is look at the label of the bucket

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:52.880
and say, when I say terrifying, here's what I mean.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:55.120
So the point is it's very lossy.

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.320
I had all this nuanced information

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.160
of what I thought of the movie

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:00.720
and I'm sending you a very low-res package

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:02.040
that you're gonna now guess

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.080
what the high-res thing looked like.

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.720
That's language in general.

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:07.160
Our thoughts are much more nuanced.

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:09.760
If we can think to each other, we can do amazing things.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.640
We could A, have a brainstorm that doesn't feel like,

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.080
oh, we're not talking in each other's heads.

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.520
Not just that I hear your voice.

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:15.800
No, no, no, we are just thinking.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.960
No words are being said internally or externally.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.720
The two brains are literally collaborating.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.560
It's something, it's a skill.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.400
I'm sure we'd have to get good at it.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.080
I'm sure young kids will be great at it

01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.480
and old people will be bad.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.440
But you think together and together you're like,

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.600
I had the joint epiphany

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.760
and now how about eight people in a room doing it, right?

01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.040
So it gets, there's other examples.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:37.520
How about when you're a dress designer or a bridge designer

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.760
and you want to show people what your dress looks like.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.480
Well, right now you gotta sketch it for a long time.

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:44.320
Here, just beam it onto the screen from your head

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:45.160
so you can picture it.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:47.360
If you can picture a tree in your head,

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.800
well, you can just suddenly,

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.040
whatever's in your head, you can be pictured.

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.960
So we'll have to get very good at it, right?

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:53.160
So take a skill, right?

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.400
But the possibilities, my God, talk about like,

01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.840
I feel like if that works,

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:01.320
if we really do have that as something,

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:04.160
I think it'll almost be like a new ADBC line.

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.200
It's such a big change that the idea of like anyone living

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.240
before everyone had brain machine interfaces

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:12.720
is living in like before the common era.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:16.000
It's that level of like big change if it can work.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.920
Yeah, and the like replay of memories,

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:19.280
just replaying stuff in your head.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:20.560
Oh my God, yeah.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:21.560
And copying, you know,

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.840
you can hopefully copy memories onto other things

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:27.840
and you don't have to just rely on your wet circuitry.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.560
It does make me sad, because you're right.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:32.000
The brain is incredibly neuroplastic

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.520
and so it can adjust, it can learn how to do this.

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.000
I think it'll be a skill.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.400
But probably you and I will be too old to truly learn.

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.320
Well, maybe we can get, there'll be great trainings.

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.960
You know, I'm spending the next three months

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.800
in like one of the Neuralink trainings.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.480
But it'll still be a bit of like grandpa can't.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.320
Definitely.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.160
This is, you know, I always think,

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.000
how am I gonna be old?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.400
I'm like, no, I'm gonna be great at the new phones.

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.080
It's not gonna be the phones.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.320
It's gonna be that, you know,

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.440
the kid's gonna be thinking to me,

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.960
I'm gonna be like, I just, can you just talk, please?

01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.440
And they're gonna be like, okay, I'll just talk.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.840
And they're gonna.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.440
So that'll be the equivalent of, you know,

01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.360
yelling to your grandparents today.

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.800
I really suspect, I don't know what your thoughts are,

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:10.480
but I grew up in a time when physical contact,

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.120
interaction was valuable.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:15.640
I just feel like that's going to go the way

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.080
that's gonna disappear.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:17.920
Why?

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:19.080
I mean, is there anything more intimate

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:20.200
than thinking with each other?

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.520
I mean, that's, you talk about, you know,

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.920
once we were all doing that, it might feel like,

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.880
man, everyone was so isolated from each other before.

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.720
Yeah, sorry.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.600
So I didn't say that intimacy disappears.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.600
I just meant physical, having to be in the same,

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.960
having to touch each other is.

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.640
People like that.

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.000
If it is important, won't there be whole waves

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.160
of people start to say, you know,

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.560
there's all these articles that come out about how,

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:41.120
you know, in our metaverse, we've lost something important.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.360
And then now there's a huge,

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.600
all first the hippies start doing it.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.960
And then eventually it becomes this big wave.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:46.840
And now everyone won't, you know,

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.640
if something truly is lost, won't we recover it?

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:51.640
Well, I think from first principles,

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.600
all of the components are there

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:57.400
to engineer intimate experiences in the metaverse

01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.160
or in the cyberspace.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.160
And so to me, it's,

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.560
I don't see anything profoundly unique

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.160
to the physical experience.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.240
Like, I don't understand.

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.200
But then why are you saying there's a loss there?

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.680
No, I'm just sad because I won't,

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.040
oh, it's a loss for me personally,

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:15.880
because the world.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.360
So then you do think there's something unique

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.360
in the physical experience.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.320
For me, because I was raised with it.

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.160
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:24.240
So whatever, so anything you're raised with,

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.080
you fall in love with.

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.360
Like people in this country came up with baseball.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.240
I was raised in the Soviet Union.

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:30.440
I don't understand baseball.

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.760
I get, I like it, but I don't love it

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.440
the way Americans love it.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.840
Because a lot of times they went to baseball games

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.720
with their father and then there's that family connection.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.160
There's a young kid dreaming about, I don't know,

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.840
becoming an MLB player himself.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:50.760
I don't know, something like that.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.720
But that's what you're raised with,

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.760
obviously is really important.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.280
But I mean, fundamentally to the human experience.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:58.920
Listen, we're doing this podcast in person.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.800
So clearly I still value it, but.

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:02.640
But it's true.

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.040
If this were, obviously through a screen,

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.280
we all agree that's not the same.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.120
Yeah, it's not the same.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:06.960
But if this were some, you know,

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:09.120
we had contact lenses on and like, you know,

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.800
maybe Neuralink, you know, maybe, again, forget,

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.760
again, this is all the devices,

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.240
even if it's as cool as a contact lens,

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.760
that's all old school.

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.600
Once you have the brain machine interface,

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.840
it'll just be projection of, you know,

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.320
it'll take over my visual cortex.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:25.160
My visual cortex will get put into a virtual room

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:25.980
and so will yours.

01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.120
So we will see, we will hear, really hear and see

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.360
as if where you won't have any masks, no VR mask needed.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.440
And at that point, it really will feel like,

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.280
you'll forget, you'll say,

01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.400
will we read together and physically or not?

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.960
You won't even, it'd be so unimportant,

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.160
you won't even remember.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.000
And you're right.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.040
This is one of those shifts in society

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.720
that changes everything.

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.120
Romantically, people still need to be together.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.640
There's a whole set of like physical things

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.120
with a relationship that are needed, you know, like-

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.560
Like what, like sex?

01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:00.120
Sex, but also just like, there's pheromones.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:03.160
Like there's, the physical touch is such a,

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:03.980
that's like music.

01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:06.440
It goes to such a deeply primitive part of us

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:09.780
that what physical touch with a romantic partner does

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.060
that I think that, so I'm sure there'll be a whole wave

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.880
of people who, their new thing is that, you know,

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:16.180
you're romantically involved with people

01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.420
you're never actually in person with,

01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:18.920
but, and I'm sure there'll be things

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.380
where you can actually smell what's in the room

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:21.220
and you can-

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:22.060
Yeah, and touch.

01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:24.300
Yeah, but I think that'll be one of the last things to go.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.380
I think there'll be, there's something that to me

01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:30.780
seems like something that'll be a while before people feel

01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.780
like there's nothing lost by not being in the same-

01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.860
It's very difficult to replicate the human interaction.

01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:38.660
Although sex also, again, you could,

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:39.740
not to get too like weird,

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:42.220
but you could have a thing where you basically,

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:45.500
you know, or, you know, let's just do a massage

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.820
because it's less like awkward.

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.380
But like, someone, you know-

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:50.340
Everyone is still imagining sex, so go on.

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:54.700
A masseuse could massage a fake body

01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:56.980
and you could feel whatever's happening, right?

01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:58.940
So you're lying down in your apartment alone,

01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:00.200
but you're feeling a full-

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.900
There'll be the new like YouTube or like streaming

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.020
where it's one masseuse massaging one body,

01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:06.740
but like a thousand people are experiencing-

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:07.580
Exactly, right?

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:08.620
Right now, you know what?

01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:10.620
Taylor Swift doesn't play for one person.

01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.300
It had to go around and everyone of her fans,

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:14.580
she has to go play for her or a book, right?

01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:15.740
You do it and it goes everywhere.

01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:17.100
So it'll be the same idea.

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:21.660
You've written and thought a lot about AI.

01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:26.100
So AI safety specifically, you've mentioned

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:28.300
you're actually starting a podcast, which is awesome.

01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:30.500
You're so good at talking, so good at thinking,

01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.900
so good at being weird in the most beautiful of ways,

01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:38.580
but you've been thinking about this AI safety question.

01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:42.860
Where today does your concern lie for the near future,

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:43.860
for the long-term future?

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:46.580
Like quite a bit of stuff happened,

01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:48.620
including with Elon's work with Tesla Autopilot.

01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:52.100
There's a bunch of amazing robots with Boston Dynamics

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:57.100
and everyone's favorite vacuum robot, iRobot, Roomba.

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:59.300
And then there's obviously the applications

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:01.860
of machine learning for recommender systems

01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:04.380
in Twitter, Facebook, and so on.

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.780
And face recognition for surveillance,

01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:09.140
all these kinds of things are happening.

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:12.580
Just a lot of incredible use of, not the face recognition,

01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:16.820
but the incredible use of deep learning, machine learning

01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:19.340
to capture information about people

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:24.180
and try to recommend to them what they wanna consume next.

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.340
Some of that can be abused,

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:27.100
some of that can be used for good,

01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:29.060
like for Netflix or something like that.

01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:30.300
What are your thoughts about all this?

01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:35.300
Yeah, I mean, I really don't think humans are very smart,

01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:38.660
like all things considered, I think we're like limited.

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:43.180
And we're dumb enough that we're very easily manipulable.

01:38:43.180 --> 01:38:47.260
Not just like, oh, like our emotions, people can, you know.

01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:48.100
Yeah.

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:50.220
Our emotions can be pulled like puppet strings.

01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:51.060
I mean, again, I look at,

01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.260
like I do look at what's going on

01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:53.420
in political polarization now,

01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:56.460
and I see a lot of puppet string emotions happening.

01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:58.940
So yeah, there's a lot to be scared of for sure,

01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.660
like very scared of.

01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:03.700
I get excited about a lot of very specific things.

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:06.420
Like one of the things I get excited about is I like,

01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.540
so the future of wearables, right?

01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:10.460
Again, I think that they'll be like, oh, the wrist,

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:12.340
the fit bit around my wrist is gonna seem, you know,

01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:17.100
the whoop is gonna seem really hilariously old school

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:17.940
in 20 years.

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:18.780
Like with Neuralink.

01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:21.020
Wear like a big bracelet, right?

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:24.140
It's gonna turn into little sensors in our blood probably,

01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:26.580
or, you know, even, you know, infrared, you know,

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:28.700
just things that are gonna be,

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:31.660
collecting a hundred times more data than it collects now,

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:34.420
more nuanced data, more specific to our body.

01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:36.660
And it's going to be, you know, super reliable,

01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:38.100
but that's the hardware side.

01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:40.460
And then the software is gonna be,

01:39:40.460 --> 01:39:41.660
this is, I've not done my deep dive,

01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.620
this is all speculation,

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:45.060
but the software is gonna get really good.

01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.940
And this is the AI component.

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:49.180
And so I get excited about specific things like that.

01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:51.260
Like think about if you're,

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:54.580
if hardware were able to collect,

01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:56.660
first of all, the hardware knows your whole genome,

01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:00.700
and we know a lot more about what a genome sequence means.

01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:03.420
Cause you can collect your genome now,

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:04.460
and we just don't know much.

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.140
Okay, we don't have much to do with that information.

01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.220
As AI gets, so now you have your genome,

01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:11.260
you've got what's in your blood at any given moment,

01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:13.260
all the levels of everything, right?

01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.140
You have the exact width of your heart arteries

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:17.060
at any given moment.

01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:20.660
You've got all the, all the virons,

01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:22.780
all the viruses that ever visited your body,

01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:24.020
cause there's a trace of it.

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:25.700
So you have all the pathogens,

01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:28.660
all the things that like you should be concerned about

01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:30.740
health-wise and might have threatened you,

01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:32.940
you might be immune from all of that kind of stuff.

01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:35.620
They also, of course, it knows how fast your heart is beating

01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:37.140
and it knows how much you, you know,

01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.460
exactly the amount of exercise,

01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:41.140
it knows your muscle mass and your weight and all that,

01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:42.980
but it also maybe can even know your emotions.

01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.980
I mean, if emotions, you know, what are they, you know,

01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:45.820
where do they come from?

01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:48.820
Probably pretty obvious chemicals once we get in there.

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.660
So again, Neuralink can be involved here maybe

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:53.140
in collecting information, you know,

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:54.100
cause right now you have to do the thing,

01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.020
what's your mood right now?

01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.300
And it's hard to even assess, you know,

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.860
and you're in a bad mood, it's hard to even, but.

01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:01.780
By the way, just as a shout out, Lisa Feldman Barrett,

01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:04.820
who's a neuroscientist at Northeastern,

01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:07.060
just wrote a, not just, like a few years ago,

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.700
wrote a whole book saying our expression of emotions

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:12.220
has nothing to do with the experience of emotion.

01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:15.100
So you really actually want to be measuring.

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.500
That, that's exactly, and you can tell,

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.540
cause one of these apps pops up and says, you know,

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:20.660
what, how do you feel right now?

01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:21.500
Good, bad?

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.100
I'm like, I don't know, like I feel bad right now

01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.420
because the thing popping up reminded me

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:27.380
that I'm procrastinating, cause I was on my phone,

01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:29.300
I should've been, you know, like that's not my, you know.

01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:33.380
So I think we'll probably be able to very,

01:41:33.380 --> 01:41:34.660
get all this info, right?

01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:37.260
Now the AI can go to town.

01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:39.700
Think about when the AI gets really good at this

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:42.460
and it knows your genome and it knows it can just,

01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:45.460
I want the AI to just tell me what to do.

01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.820
When it turns up, okay, for wanting to, so how about this?

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:50.540
Now imagine attaching that to a meal service, right?

01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:51.700
And the meal service has everything, you know,

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:54.140
all the, you know, million ingredients and supplements

01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:55.860
and vitamins and everything.

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:59.420
And I give the, I tell the AI my broad goals.

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:02.500
I want to gain muscle or I want to, you know,

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.220
maintain my weight, but I want to have more energy

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:05.540
or whatever, I just want, or I want to, you know,

01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:06.660
I just want to be very healthy and I want to,

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:09.420
obviously everyone wants the same, like 10 basic things,

01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:11.300
like you want to avoid cancer, you want to, you know,

01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:13.180
various things, you want to age slower.

01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:19.300
So now the AI has my goals and a drone comes at,

01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:22.340
you know, a little thing pops up and it says like,

01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:23.500
you know, beep beep, like, you know,

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:25.060
15 minutes you're going to eat.

01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:25.980
Cause it knows that's a great,

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:27.860
that's the right time for my body to eat.

01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:30.180
15 minutes later, a little slot opens in my wall

01:42:30.180 --> 01:42:32.140
where a drone has come from the factory,

01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:35.140
the eating, the food factory and dropped the perfect meal

01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:38.820
for my, that moment for me, for my mood, for my genome,

01:42:38.820 --> 01:42:40.700
for my blood contents.

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:42.740
And it's, cause it knows my goals.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:44.620
So, you know, it knows I want to feel energy at this time

01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:45.740
and then I want to wind down here.

01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:47.420
So I, those things you have to tell it.

01:42:47.420 --> 01:42:49.740
Well, plus the pleasure thing, like it knows

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.980
what kind of components of a meal you've enjoyed

01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:53.940
in the past so you can assemble the perfect meal.

01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:56.980
Exactly, it knows you way better than you know yourself,

01:42:56.980 --> 01:42:58.380
better than any human could ever know you.

01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:59.980
And a little thing pops up,

01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:01.500
you still have some choice, right?

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:05.260
It still, it pops up and it says like, you know, coffee,

01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:07.340
because it knows that, you know, my cutoff,

01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:08.980
they says, you know, I can have coffee

01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:11.580
for the next 15 minutes only because at that point

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.980
it knows how long it stays in my system.

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:14.780
It knows what my sleep is like when I have it too late.

01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:16.260
It knows I have to wake up at this time tomorrow.

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.780
That was my calendar.

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:19.300
And so I think a lot of people's,

01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:22.140
this is I think something that humans are wrong about

01:43:22.140 --> 01:43:23.700
is that most people will hear this and be like,

01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:26.100
that sounds awful, that sounds dystopian.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.500
No, it doesn't, it sounds incredible.

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.700
And if we all had this, we would not look back and be like,

01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:32.180
I wish I was like making awful choices every day,

01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:33.740
like I was in the past.

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:36.220
And then this isn't, these aren't important decisions.

01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:38.900
Your important decision-making energy,

01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:41.460
your important focus and your attention

01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:43.460
can go onto your kids and on your work

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:45.380
and on, you know, helping other people

01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:46.420
at things that matter.

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.980
And so I think AI can,

01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.700
when I think about like personal lifestyle, stuff like that,

01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:55.420
I really love, like, I love thinking about that.

01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:56.260
I think it's gonna be very,

01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:58.180
and I think we'll all be so much healthier

01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:00.460
that when we look back today,

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:02.060
one of the things that's gonna look so primitive

01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.420
is the one size fits all thing.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.660
You're getting like reading advice about keto.

01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:10.020
Each genome is gonna have very specific,

01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.740
one, you know, unique advice coming from AI.

01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:14.180
And so, yeah.

01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:16.020
Yeah, the customization that's enabled

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:18.900
by collection of data and the use of AI,

01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:20.260
a lot of people think what's the,

01:44:20.260 --> 01:44:22.340
like they think of the worst case scenario

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:25.180
that data being used by authoritarian governments

01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:26.580
to control you, all that kind of stuff.

01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.420
They don't think about most likely,

01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:30.020
especially in a capitalist society,

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:34.300
it's most likely going to be used as part of a competition

01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:36.780
to get you the most delicious and healthy meal possible

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:38.340
as fast as possible.

01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:40.700
Yeah, so the world will definitely be much better

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:42.260
with the integration of data.

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:46.420
But of course, you wanna be able to be transparent

01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:48.340
and honest about how that data is misused,

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.380
and that's why it's important to have free speech

01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:51.460
and people to speak out,

01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.620
like when some bullshit is being done by companies.

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.940
That we need to have our wits about us as a society.

01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:00.460
Like, this is, free speech is the mechanism

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.500
by which the big brain can think,

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:05.940
can think for itself, can think straight, can see straight.

01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:07.300
When you take away free speech,

01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:09.900
when you start saying that in every topic,

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:10.940
when any topic's political,

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:12.820
it becomes treacherous to talk about.

01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:15.660
So forget the government taking away free speech.

01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:18.860
If the culture penalizes nuanced conversation

01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:21.060
about any topic that's political,

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:24.380
and the politics is so all consuming

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:29.380
and it's such a incredible market to polarize people,

01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.460
for media to polarize people,

01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.740
and to bring any topic it can into that

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:36.700
and get people hooked on it as a political topic,

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:38.100
we become a very dumb society.

01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:39.860
So free speech goes away as far as it matters.

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:42.060
People say, oh, people like to say outside.

01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:43.220
You don't even know what free speech is.

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:46.860
Free speech is, your free speech is not being violent.

01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:48.380
It's like, no, you're right.

01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:50.780
My first amendment rights are not being violated.

01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.060
But the culture of free speech,

01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.860
which is the second ingredient of two,

01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:55.540
you need the first amendment

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.260
and you need the culture of free speech.

01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:58.380
And now you have free speech

01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:00.940
and the culture is much more specific.

01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:01.900
You obviously can have a culture

01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:03.940
that bullies people right now,

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:06.340
take any topic again that has to do with like,

01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:10.060
some very sensitive topics, police shootings,

01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:13.700
or what's going on in K through 12 schools

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:16.860
or even climate change, take any of these.

01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:20.540
And the first amendment is still there.

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:22.740
You're not gonna get arrested no matter what you say.

01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:25.660
The culture of free speech is gone

01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.100
because you will be destroyed.

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.420
Your life can be over as far as it matters

01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:31.700
if you say the wrong thing.

01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:35.300
But a really vigorous culture of free speech,

01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:36.540
you get no penalty at all

01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:38.380
for even saying something super dumb.

01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:40.380
People will say, like, people will laugh and be like,

01:46:40.380 --> 01:46:42.660
well, that was like kind of hilariously offensive

01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:43.940
and like not at all correct.

01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:45.460
Like, you know, you're wrong and here's why.

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:47.100
But no one's like mad at you.

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.660
Now the brain is thinking at its best.

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:52.060
The IQ of the big brain is like as high as it can be

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:53.100
in that culture.

01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.060
And the culture where, and you say something wrong

01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:56.540
and people say, oh, wow, you've changed.

01:46:56.540 --> 01:46:58.780
Oh, wow, like, look, this is his real colors.

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:01.580
You know, the big brain is dumb.

01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.860
You still have mutual respect for each other.

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:06.980
So like, you don't think lesser of others

01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:08.500
when they say a bunch of dumb things.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.820
You know, it's just a play of ideas.

01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:11.860
But you still have respect.

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:12.820
You still have love for them.

01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:15.700
Because I think the worst case is when you have

01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.740
a complete free, like, anarchy of ideas

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:22.140
where it's like everybody lost hope

01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:25.700
that something like a truth can even be converged towards.

01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:27.500
Like everybody has their own truth.

01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.540
Then it's just chaos.

01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:32.540
Like, if you have mutual respect and a mutual goal

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:35.020
of arriving at the truth and the humility

01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:37.140
that you want to listen to other people's ideas

01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:38.900
and a forgiveness that other people's ideas

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:40.380
might be dumb as hell, that doesn't mean

01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:42.380
there are lesser beings, all that kind of stuff.

01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:44.500
But that's like a weird balance to strike.

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:47.500
Right now, people are being trained, little kids,

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:49.620
college students being trained to think

01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:51.340
the exact opposite way.

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.220
To think that there's no such thing as objective truth,

01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:54.620
which is, you know, the objective truth

01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:59.140
is the end on the compass for every thinker.

01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:02.100
Doesn't mean we're necessarily on our way or refining,

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:03.540
but we're all aiming in the same direction.

01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:04.980
And we all believe that there's a place

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:06.660
we can eventually get closer to.

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:09.660
Not objective truth, you know, teaching them

01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:12.100
that disagreement is bad, violence.

01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:16.820
You know, it's, you know, it's like, you know,

01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:18.460
you quickly sound like you're just going on

01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:20.300
like a political rant with this topic,

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:22.340
but like, it's really bad.

01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:24.700
It's like genuinely the worst.

01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:29.180
If I had my own country, I mean, it's like,

01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:31.700
I would teach kids some very specific things

01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:34.220
that this is doing the exact opposite of.

01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:38.380
And it sucks, it sucks.

01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:40.700
Speaking of a way to escape this,

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:43.460
you've tweeted 30 minutes of reading a day equals,

01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:45.380
yeah, this whole video and it's cool to think

01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:48.660
about reading like in an, as a habit

01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.260
and something that accumulates.

01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.220
You said 30 minutes of reading a day equals

01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:54.300
1000 books in 50 years.

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.940
I love like thinking about this,

01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:59.340
like chipping away at the mountain.

01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.700
Can you expand on that?

01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:02.940
Sort of the habit of reading,

01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:04.660
how do you recommend people read?

01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.980
Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's incredible.

01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:10.620
If you do something, a little of something every day,

01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.820
it compiles, it compiles.

01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:14.340
You know, I always think about like the people

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.740
who achieve these incredible things in life,

01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:19.620
these great, like famous, legendary people,

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.340
they have the same number of days that you do.

01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:23.700
And it's not like they were doing magical days.

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:26.660
They just, they got a little done every day.

01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:29.700
And that adds up to a monument,

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:34.020
they're putting one brick in a day,

01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:35.060
eventually they have this building,

01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:36.340
this legendary building.

01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:39.140
So you can take writing, someone who, you know,

01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:42.180
there's two aspiring writers and one doesn't ever write,

01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.900
doesn't, you know, manages to never, you know,

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:45.100
zero write, zero pages a day.

01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:49.420
And the other one manages to do two pages a week, right?

01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:50.260
Not very much.

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.780
The other one does zero pages a week, two pages a week,

01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:55.500
98% of both of their time is the same.

01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:58.620
The other person, just 2%, they're doing one other thing.

01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:00.740
One year later, they have written,

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:01.780
they write two books a year.

01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:04.460
This prolific person, you know, in 20 years,

01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:05.540
they've written 40 books.

01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:07.540
They're one of the most prolific writers of all time.

01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:08.980
They write two pages a week.

01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:11.020
Sorry, that's not true.

01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:12.340
That was two pages a day.

01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:13.460
Okay, two pages a week,

01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.900
you're still writing about a book every two years.

01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.940
So in 20 years, you've still written 10 books,

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:19.780
also prolific writer, right?

01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:21.420
Huge, massive writing career.

01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:23.420
You write two pages every Sunday morning.

01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:25.260
The other person has the same exact week

01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:26.940
and they don't do that Sunday morning thing.

01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:27.980
They are a wannabe writer.

01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:29.180
They always said they could write.

01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:30.940
They talk about how they used to be

01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:31.980
and nothing happens, right?

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:34.300
So it's inspiring, I think,

01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.740
for a lot of people who feel frustrated,

01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:36.580
they're not doing anything.

01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.580
So reading is another example

01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:43.580
where someone who reads very, you know, doesn't read

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:45.700
and someone who's a prolific reader.

01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.580
You know, I always think about like the Tyler Cowan types.

01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:50.020
I'm like, how the hell do you read so much?

01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:51.380
It's infuriating, you know?

01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:53.860
Or like James Clear puts out his like,

01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:56.260
his 10 favorite books of the year,

01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:57.860
20, his 20 favorite books of the year.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:00.700
I'm like, your 20 favorites?

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.220
Like, I'm trying to just read 20 books.

01:51:02.220 --> 01:51:03.580
Like, that would be an amazing year.

01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:06.060
So, but the thing is,

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:07.980
they're not doing something crazy and magical.

01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:09.980
They're just reading a half hour a night, you know?

01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:11.620
If you read a half hour a night,

01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:13.500
the calculation I came to is that you can read

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.260
a thousand books in 50 years.

01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:18.620
So if someone who's 80 and they've read a thousand books,

01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:20.060
you know, between 30 and 80,

01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:21.780
they are extremely well-read.

01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:24.780
They can delve deep into many non-fiction areas.

01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:27.780
They can be, you know, an amazing fiction reader,

01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:29.300
avid fiction reader.

01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:30.540
And again, that's a half hour a day.

01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:31.500
Some people can do an hour,

01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:33.020
a half hour in the morning audio book,

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.100
half hour at night in bed.

01:51:34.100 --> 01:51:35.100
Now they've read 2,000 books.

01:51:35.100 --> 01:51:40.100
So I think it's just, it's motivating.

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:43.780
And you realize that a lot of times you think

01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:45.780
that the people who are doing amazing things

01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:48.820
and you're not, you think that there's a bigger gap

01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:51.380
between you and them than there really is.

01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:53.980
I, on the reading front, I'm a very slow reader,

01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:57.540
which is just a very frustrating fact about me,

01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:00.660
but I'm faster with audio books.

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:02.460
And also I just, you know, I'll just,

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:04.300
it's just hard to get myself to read,

01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:06.660
but I've started doing audio books and I'll wake up,

01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:09.700
throw it on, do it in the shower, brushing my teeth,

01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.700
you know, making breakfast, dealing with the dogs,

01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:14.140
things like that, whatever, until I sit down.

01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:17.820
And that's, I can read, I can read a book a week,

01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:20.420
a book every 10 days at that clip.

01:52:20.420 --> 01:52:21.820
And suddenly I'm this big reader

01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:24.180
because I'm just, while doing my morning stuff,

01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:25.340
I have it on and also it's this fun,

01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:26.260
it makes the morning so fun.

01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:27.860
I'm like having a great time the whole morning

01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:29.500
because I'm like, oh, I'm so into this book.

01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:30.740
So I think that, you know,

01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:32.580
audio books is another amazing gift

01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:34.180
to people who have a hard time reading.

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.300
I find that that's actually an interesting skill.

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.700
I do audio books quite a bit.

01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:41.740
Like it's a skill to maintain, at least for me,

01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:43.180
probably the kind of books I read,

01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:45.620
which is often like history or like,

01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:49.660
there's a lot of content and if you miss parts of it,

01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:51.940
you miss out on stuff.

01:52:51.940 --> 01:52:55.700
And so it's a skill to maintain focus, at least for me.

01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.900
Well, the 10 second back button is very valuable.

01:52:58.900 --> 01:52:59.740
Oh, interesting.

01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:01.180
So I just, if I get lost,

01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:02.500
sometimes the book is so good

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.020
that I'm thinking about what the person just said

01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:06.580
and I just get the skill for me is just remembering to pause.

01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:09.060
And if I don't, no problem, just back, back, back, back.

01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:10.500
Just three quick backs.

01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:12.180
So that, of course, is not that efficient,

01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:14.060
but it's, I do the same thing when I'm reading.

01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:15.940
I'll read a whole paragraph and realize I was tuning out.

01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:17.140
Yeah. You know?

01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:19.820
You know, I haven't actually even considered to try that.

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:22.940
I've been so hard on myself, maintaining focus

01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:24.340
because you do get lost in thought.

01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:25.180
Maybe I should try that.

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:26.860
Yeah, and when you get lost in thought, by the way,

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:27.940
you're processing the book.

01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:29.260
That's not wasted time.

01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:31.340
That's your brain really categorizing

01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.500
and cataloging what you just read and like.

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:36.100
Well, there are several kinds of thoughts, right?

01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:37.580
There's thoughts related to the book

01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:40.100
and there's a thought that it could take you elsewhere.

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:43.900
Well, I find that if I am continually thinking

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:45.740
about something else, I just say, I'm not,

01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:47.780
I just pause the book.

01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:50.580
Yeah, especially in the shower or something when like,

01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:52.180
that's sometimes when really great thoughts come up.

01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:53.900
If I'm having all these thoughts about other stuff,

01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:55.900
I'm saying clearly my mind wants to work on something else.

01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:56.740
I'll just pause it.

01:53:56.740 --> 01:53:57.820
Yeah, quiet Dan Carlin.

01:53:57.820 --> 01:53:59.260
I'm thinking about something else right now.

01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:00.620
Exactly, exactly.

01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:04.220
Also, you can, things like you have to head out to the store.

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.500
Like I'm gonna read 20 pages on that trip,

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.540
just walking back and forth, going to the airport.

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:10.460
I mean, flights, you know, the Uber,

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:13.100
and then you're walking to the, walking through the airport,

01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:14.020
you're shedding the security line.

01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:15.260
I'm reading the whole time.

01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:17.420
Like, I know this is not groundbreaking.

01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:18.540
People know what audio books are,

01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:20.700
but I think that more people should probably get

01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:21.540
into them than do.

01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:22.360
Cause I know a lot of people,

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:24.020
they have this stubborn kind of things that I don't like.

01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:25.780
I like to have the paper book and sure,

01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:27.940
but like, it's pretty fun to be able to read.

01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:31.100
I still, I listen to a huge number of audio books

01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:32.940
and podcasts, but I still,

01:54:32.940 --> 01:54:36.580
the most impactful experiences for me are still reading.

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:38.380
And I read very, very slow.

01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:41.100
And it's very frustrating when like,

01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:42.100
you go to these websites,

01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:45.660
that estimate how long a book takes on average,

01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:46.580
that those are always annoying.

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:48.820
They do like a page a minute when I read like,

01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:51.780
best, a page every two minutes at best.

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:54.540
At best, when you're like really like,

01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:55.820
actually not pausing.

01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:58.100
I just, my ADD, it's like, I just,

01:54:58.100 --> 01:54:59.900
it's hard to keep focusing.

01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:01.860
And I also like to really absorb.

01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:04.860
So on the other side of things, when I finish a book,

01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:06.140
10 years later, I'll be like, you know,

01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:07.020
that scene when this happens,

01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:07.860
and another friend of read it would be like,

01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.460
what, I don't remember any like details.

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:10.900
I'm like, oh, I can tell you like the entire,

01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:12.420
so I absorbed the shit out of it.

01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:14.820
But I don't think it's worth it to like have to read

01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:16.580
so less, so much less in my life.

01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:18.740
I actually, so in terms of going to the airport,

01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:22.260
you know, in these like filler moments of life,

01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:24.860
I do a lot of, it's an app called Anki.

01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:26.620
I don't know if you know about it.

01:55:26.620 --> 01:55:29.180
It's a space repetition app.

01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:31.580
So there's all of these facts I have when I read,

01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:33.940
I write it down if I want to remember it.

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:37.700
And it's these, you review it and the one,

01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:39.180
the things you remember,

01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:41.420
it takes longer and longer to bring back up.

01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:43.700
It's like flashcards, but a digital app.

01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:44.540
It's called Anki.

01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:45.380
I recommend it to a lot of people.

01:55:45.380 --> 01:55:46.820
There's a huge community of people

01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:48.420
that are just like obsessed with it.

01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:49.780
Anki?

01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:50.620
Anki.

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:55.660
So this is extremely well-known app and idea,

01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:59.500
like among students who are like medical students,

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.900
like people that really have to study.

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:03.780
Like, this is not like fun stuff.

01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:06.340
They really have to memorize a lot of things.

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:07.420
They have to remember them well.

01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:08.580
They have to be able to integrate them

01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:09.500
with a bunch of ideas.

01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.980
So, and I find it to be really useful for,

01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:14.820
like when you read history,

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:17.820
if you think this particular factoid,

01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:19.780
they'd probably be extremely useful for you

01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:23.460
because you're, that'd be interesting actually thought

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:25.540
because you're doing, you talked about like opening up

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:27.700
a trillion tabs and reading things.

01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:32.260
You know, you probably want to remember some facts

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:33.540
you read along the way.

01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:34.940
Like you might remember, okay,

01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:37.060
this thing I can't directly put into the writing,

01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:38.860
but it's a cool little factoid.

01:56:38.860 --> 01:56:39.700
I want to-

01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:40.540
So all the time.

01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:41.380
Store that in there.

01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:42.220
Yeah.

01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.860
And that's where I go, Anki, drop it in and-

01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:45.020
Oh, you can just drop it in.

01:56:45.020 --> 01:56:45.860
Yeah.

01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:48.620
You drop it in a line of a podcast or like a video?

01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:49.620
Well, no.

01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:50.540
I guess I can type it though.

01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:51.380
So, yes.

01:56:51.380 --> 01:56:54.860
So Anki, there's a bunch of, it's called space repetition.

01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:57.060
There's a bunch of apps that are much nicer than Anki.

01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:00.500
Anki is the ghetto, like Craigslist version,

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.940
but it has a giant community because people are like,

01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:04.540
we don't want features.

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:06.620
We want a text box.

01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:08.780
It's very basic, very stripped down.

01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:09.900
So you can drop in stuff.

01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:10.740
You can drop in-

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:11.580
That sounds really,

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:13.740
I can't believe I have not come across this.

01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:15.100
Actually, once you look into it,

01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:18.300
you'll realize that, how have I not come,

01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.940
you are the person,

01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:22.020
I guarantee you'll probably write a blog about it.

01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:23.260
I can't believe you actually haven't-

01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:24.100
Well, it's also just like-

01:57:24.100 --> 01:57:25.100
It's your people too.

01:57:25.100 --> 01:57:28.220
And my people say, what do you write about?

01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:30.740
Literally anything I find interesting.

01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:33.740
And so for me, once you start a blog,

01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:36.700
your entire worldview becomes,

01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:37.740
would this be a good blog post?

01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:40.260
I mean, it's the lens I see everything through,

01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:43.220
but I'm constantly coming across something,

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:44.140
or just a tweet,

01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:46.420
something that I'm like,

01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:47.940
oh, I need to share this with my readers.

01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:52.940
My readers to me are like my friends who I'm like,

01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:55.260
oh, I need to tell them about this.

01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:56.460
And so I feel like just a place to,

01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:58.100
I mean, I collect things in a document right now

01:57:58.100 --> 01:57:58.940
if it's really good,

01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:01.020
but it's the little factoids and stuff like that,

01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:03.060
I think, especially if I'm learning something.

01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:05.180
So the problem is when you save stuff,

01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:06.020
when you look at it,

01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:07.980
a tweet and all that kind of stuff,

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:11.580
is you also need to couple that with a system for review.

01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:14.100
Because what Enki does is like literally,

01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:15.300
it determines for me,

01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.460
I don't have to do anything.

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:18.700
There's this giant pile of things I've saved

01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:20.380
and it brings up to me,

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:24.020
okay, here's, I don't know,

01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:27.740
when Churchill did something, right?

01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:29.900
I'm reading about World War II a lot now,

01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:31.380
like a particular event.

01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:32.220
Here's that.

01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.940
And you remember what year that happened

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:36.740
and you say yes or no,

01:58:36.740 --> 01:58:38.740
or like you get to pick,

01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:40.140
you get to see the answer,

01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.140
and you get to self-evaluate

01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:43.420
how well you remember that fact.

01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:44.380
And if you remember, well,

01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:46.940
it'll be another month before you see it again.

01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:48.940
If you don't remember, it'll bring it up again.

01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:50.620
That's a way to review tweets,

01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:52.300
to review concepts,

01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:54.780
and it offloads the kind of,

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:56.380
the process of selecting which parts

01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:57.500
you're supposed to review or not.

01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:59.020
And you can grow that library,

01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:00.860
I mean, obviously medical students use it

01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:03.220
for like tens of thousands of facts.

01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:05.180
It just gamifies it too.

01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:06.860
It's like you can passively sit back

01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:09.180
and just, and the thing will like make sure

01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:11.500
you eventually learn it all versus,

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.540
you don't have to be the executive

01:59:13.540 --> 01:59:15.380
calling that like the program,

01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:17.540
the memorization program someone else is handling.

01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:20.940
I would love to hear about like you trying it out

01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:22.420
or space repetition as an idea.

01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:23.660
There's a few other apps,

01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:24.940
but Anki is the big master.

01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:26.220
I totally wanna try it.

01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:27.700
You've written and spoken quite a bit

01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:29.020
about procrastination.

01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:32.860
I like you suffer from procrastination

01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:35.980
like many other people suffer in quotes.

01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:39.780
How do we avoid procrastination?

01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:42.060
I don't think the suffer is in quotes.

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:45.700
I think that's a huge part of the problem

01:59:45.700 --> 01:59:48.940
is that it's treated like a silly problem.

01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:55.100
People don't take it seriously as a dire problem,

01:59:56.300 --> 01:59:57.940
but it can be.

01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:00.940
It can ruin your life.

02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:08.300
There's like, we talked about the compiling concept

02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:11.420
with if you read a little,

02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:15.620
okay, if you write, if you write two pages a week,

02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:16.740
you write a book every two years,

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:18.260
you're a prolific writer, right?

02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:20.300
And the difference between,

02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:22.620
again, it's not that that person's working so hard,

02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:24.700
it's that they have the ability to,

02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:26.500
when they commit to something like on Sunday mornings,

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.740
I'm gonna write two pages.

02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:29.420
That's it.

02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:33.860
They respect, they have enough,

02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:36.820
they respect the part of them that made that decision

02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:39.500
is a respected character in their brain.

02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:41.340
And they say, well, that's, I decided it,

02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:42.260
so I'm gonna do it.

02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:46.820
The procrastinator won't do those two pages.

02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:48.620
That's just exactly the kind of thing

02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:50.100
the procrastinator will keep on their list

02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:51.060
and they will not do.

02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:53.460
But that doesn't mean they're any less talented

02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:55.020
than the writer who does the two pages.

02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:57.420
Doesn't mean they want it any less.

02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:58.900
Maybe they want it even more.

02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:01.260
And it doesn't mean that they wouldn't be just as happy

02:01:01.260 --> 02:01:03.660
having done it as the writer who doesn't.

02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:05.100
So what they're missing out on,

02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:09.260
picture a writer who writes 10 books, bestsellers,

02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:11.100
and they go on these book tours

02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:15.940
and they just are so gratified with their career

02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.580
and they think about what the other person is missing

02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:23.500
who does none of that, right?

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:27.820
So that is a massive loss, a massive loss.

02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:32.020
And it's because the internal mechanism in their brain

02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:33.940
is not doing what the other person's is.

02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:35.460
So they don't have the respect

02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:38.020
for the part of them that made the choice.

02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:40.060
They feel like it's someone they can disregard.

02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:42.780
And so to me, it's just in the same boat

02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:47.220
as someone who is obese because their eating habits

02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:50.820
make them obese over time or their exercise habits.

02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:54.300
That's a huge loss for that person.

02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.700
That person is, you know, the health problems

02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.020
and it's just probably making them miserable.

02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:01.900
And it's self-inflicted, right?

02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:03.140
It's self-defeating,

02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:06.140
but that doesn't make it an easy problem to fix

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:07.500
just because you're doing it to yourself.

02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:09.380
So to me, procrastination is another one of these

02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:11.820
where you are the only person in your own way.

02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:15.220
You are failing at something

02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:17.580
or not doing something that you really wanna do.

02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:18.900
You know, it doesn't have to be work.

02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:21.260
Maybe you wanna get out of that marriage

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:23.060
that you realize it hits you,

02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:24.300
you shouldn't be in this marriage.

02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:25.140
You should get divorced

02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.140
and you wait 20 extra years before you do it

02:02:27.140 --> 02:02:28.380
or you don't do it at all.

02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:33.660
That is, you know, you're not living the life

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:35.100
that you know you should be living, right?

02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:38.020
And so I think it's fascinating.

02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:39.940
Now, the problem is it's also a funny problem

02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:43.020
because there's short-term procrastination,

02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:44.220
which I talk about as, you know,

02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:45.700
the kind that has a deadline.

02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:47.980
Now, some people, you know,

02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:50.540
this is when I bring in, there's different characters,

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.580
there's the panic monster comes in the room

02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:54.500
and that's when you actually, you know,

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:57.780
the procrastinator can, there's different levels.

02:02:57.780 --> 02:03:02.540
There's the kind that even when there's a deadline,

02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:04.660
they stop panicking, they just, they've given up

02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:06.460
and they really have a problem.

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:08.340
Then there's the kind that when there's a deadline,

02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:10.300
they'll do it, but they'll wait till the last second.

02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:13.300
Both of those people, I think, have a huge problem

02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:15.060
once there's no deadline.

02:03:15.060 --> 02:03:17.420
Because, and most of the important things in life,

02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:18.500
there's no deadline, which is, you know,

02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:21.940
changing your career, you know, becoming a writer

02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:23.220
when you never have been before,

02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:24.900
getting out of your relationship,

02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:28.540
you're gonna be doing whatever you need to,

02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:29.620
the changes you need to make

02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:31.060
in order to get into a relationship.

02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:32.700
There's a thing after it.

02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:33.820
Launching a startup.

02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:35.380
Launching a startup, right?

02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:37.300
Or once you've launched a startup,

02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:39.580
firing is someone that needs to be fired, right?

02:03:39.580 --> 02:03:40.420
Yes.

02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:41.940
I mean, going out for fundraising

02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:43.380
instead of just trying to, you know,

02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:46.460
there's so many moments when the big change

02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:48.380
that you know you should be making

02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:51.940
that would completely change your life if you just did it

02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:53.220
has no deadline.

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:55.620
It just has to be coming from yourself.

02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:00.620
And I think that a ton of people have a problem

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:04.900
where they will, they think this delusion

02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:05.860
that, you know, I'm gonna do that.

02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:06.980
I'm definitely gonna do that.

02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:09.420
You know, but not this week, not this month,

02:04:09.420 --> 02:04:10.860
not today, because whatever.

02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:12.300
And they make this excuse again and again,

02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:15.100
and it just sits there on their list collecting dust.

02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:20.340
And so, yeah, to me, it is very real suffering.

02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:25.340
And the fix isn't fixing the habits, just like not-

02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:27.260
I'm still working on the fix, first of all.

02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:30.180
So there's, okay, there is,

02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:34.580
there's, just say you have a boat that sucks

02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:36.940
and it's leaking and it's gonna sink.

02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:39.740
You can fix it with duct tape for a couple of,

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.900
you know, for one ride or whatever.

02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:43.380
That's not really fixing the boat,

02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:44.500
but it can get you by.

02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:47.260
So there's duct tape solutions.

02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:49.140
To me, so the panic monster is the character

02:04:49.140 --> 02:04:52.060
that rushes into the room once the deadline gets too close

02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:54.500
or once there's some scary external pressure,

02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:55.500
not just from yourself.

02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:59.100
And that's a huge aid to a lot of procrastinators.

02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:00.780
Again, there's a lot of people who won't,

02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:02.100
you know, do that thing.

02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:03.660
They've been writing that book they wanted to write,

02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:05.020
but there's way fewer people

02:05:05.020 --> 02:05:07.060
who will not show up to the exam.

02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:08.900
You know, most people show up to the exam.

02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:12.340
So that's because the panic monster

02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:14.580
is gonna freak out if they don't.

02:05:14.580 --> 02:05:16.580
So you can create a panic monster.

02:05:16.580 --> 02:05:19.260
If you wanna, you know, you really wanna write music,

02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:20.740
you really wanna become a singer-songwriter,

02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:25.540
well, book a venue, tell 40 people about it

02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:27.940
and say, hey, on, you know, this day, two months from now,

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:30.260
come and see, I'm gonna play you some of my songs.

02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:31.860
You now have a panic monster, you're gonna write songs,

02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:33.340
you're gonna have to, right?

02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:38.340
So there's duct tape things, you know, you can do things,

02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:40.900
I've done a lot of this with a friend,

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:44.580
and I say, if I don't get X done by a week from now,

02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:47.340
I have to donate a lot of money

02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:48.740
somewhere I don't wanna donate.

02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:51.460
You would put that in the category of duct tape solutions.

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:55.220
Yeah, because it's not, why do I need that, right?

02:05:55.220 --> 02:05:56.540
If I really had solved this,

02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:58.940
this is something I want to do for me, it's selfish.

02:05:58.940 --> 02:06:01.380
This is, I just literally just want to be selfish here

02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:02.700
and do the work I need to do

02:06:02.700 --> 02:06:04.580
to get the goals I wanna get, right?

02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:08.580
All the incentives should be in the right place.

02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:10.420
And yet, if I don't say that,

02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:12.020
it'll be a week from now and I won't have done it.

02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:14.060
Something weird is going on, there's some resistance,

02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:17.780
there's some force that is in my own way, right?

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:21.140
And so doing something where I have to pay all this money,

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:22.460
okay, now I'll panic and I'll do it.

02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:23.900
So that's duct tape.

02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:27.340
Fixing the boat is something where I don't have to do that,

02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:29.060
I just will do the things that I,

02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:33.020
again, it's not talking about super crazy work ethic,

02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:36.500
just like, for example, okay, I have a lot of examples

02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:40.140
because I have a serious problem that I've been working on.

02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:42.220
And in some ways, I've gotten really successful

02:06:42.220 --> 02:06:45.340
at solving it and in other ways, I'm still floundering.

02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:46.180
So-

02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:47.940
You're the world's greatest duct taper.

02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:50.340
Yes, well, I'm pretty good at duct taping.

02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:52.820
I probably could be even better and I'm like, and I'm-

02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:55.220
You're procrastinating and becoming a better duct taper.

02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:57.940
Literally, like, yes, there's nothing, I won't.

02:06:57.940 --> 02:07:01.140
So here's what I know what I should do as a writer, right?

02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:04.020
It's very obvious to me is that I should wake up.

02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:05.420
I don't have to be crazy, I don't have 6 a.m.

02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:08.060
or anything sane or I'm not gonna be one of those

02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:10.620
people with 5.30 jogs.

02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:14.380
I'm gonna wake up at whatever, you know, 7.30, 8, 8.30

02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:17.260
and I should have a block, like, just say nine to noon

02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:22.700
where I get up and I just really quick make some coffee

02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:23.620
and write.

02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:26.900
It's obvious because all the great writers in history

02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:28.220
did exactly that.

02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:30.140
Some of them have done that, that's common.

02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:31.500
There's some that I like these writers,

02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:33.420
they do the late night sessions, but most of them,

02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:34.260
they do wake up again.

02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:36.260
But there's a session, but there's a session that's-

02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:37.820
Most writers write in the morning

02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:39.660
and there's a reason, I don't think I'm different

02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:41.100
than those people.

02:07:41.100 --> 02:07:43.820
It's a great time to write, you're fresh, right?

02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:46.860
Your ideas from dreaming have kind of collected,

02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:49.100
you have all the new answers that you didn't have

02:07:49.100 --> 02:07:51.180
yesterday and you can just go.

02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:53.380
But more importantly, if I just had a routine

02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:58.020
where I wrote from nine to noon, weekdays.

02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:02.300
Every week would have a minimum of 15 focused hours

02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:04.740
of writing, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a lot.

02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:07.700
A 15, 15, no, this is no joke, this is, you know,

02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:10.700
your phone's away, you're not talking to anyone,

02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:12.860
you're not opening your email, you are focused writing

02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:15.060
for three hours, five, that's a big week

02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:16.540
for most writers, right?

02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:18.780
So now what's happening is that every weekday

02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:21.700
is a minimum of a B, I'll give myself.

02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:24.140
A might be, wow, I really just got into a flow

02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:26.060
and wrote for six hours and had, great.

02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:28.700
But it's a minimum of a B, I can keep going if I want,

02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:31.540
and every week is a minimum of a B, that's 15 hours.

02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:33.260
And if I just talk about compiling,

02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:35.860
this is the two pages a week, if I just did that,

02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:39.020
every week I achieve all my writing goals in my life.

02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:42.620
And yet, I wake up and most days I just,

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:44.860
either I'll revenge procrastination late at night

02:08:44.860 --> 02:08:46.380
and go to bed way too late and then wake up later

02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:47.860
and get on a bad schedule and I just fall

02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:50.460
into these bad schedules, or I wake up and there's just,

02:08:50.460 --> 02:08:52.340
you know, I'll say I was gonna do a few emails

02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:53.940
and I'll open it up and I'm suddenly on text

02:08:53.940 --> 02:08:56.180
and I'm texting, or I'll just go and, you know,

02:08:56.180 --> 02:08:57.780
I'll make a phone call and I'll be on phone calls

02:08:57.780 --> 02:09:00.060
for three hours, it's always something.

02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:02.100
Or I'll start writing and then I hit a little bit of a wall,

02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:04.140
but because there's no sacred, this is a sacred

02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:06.660
writing block, I'll just hit the wall and say,

02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:08.900
well, this is icky and I'll go do something else.

02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:11.420
So, duct tape, what I've done is,

02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:14.460
wait but why has one employee, Alicia,

02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:17.320
she's the manager of lots of things, that's her role.

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:19.020
She truly does lots of things.

02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:24.020
And one of the things we started doing is,

02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:25.980
either she comes over and sits next to me

02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:29.300
where she can see my screen from nine to noon,

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.140
that's all it takes.

02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:31.580
The thing about procrastination is usually,

02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:33.780
they're not kicking and screaming, I don't wanna do this.

02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:35.300
It's the feeling of, you know, in the old days

02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:38.140
when you had to go to class and your lunch block is over

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:40.140
and it's like, oh, shit, I have class in five minutes.

02:09:40.140 --> 02:09:43.060
Or it's Monday morning, you go, oh, yeah.

02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:44.540
But you said, you know what, but you go.

02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:45.900
You say, okay, and then you get to class

02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.500
and it's not that bad once you're there, right?

02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.900
You know, you have a trainer and he says, okay, next set.

02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:51.660
And you go, oh, okay, and you do it.

02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:52.500
That's all it is.

02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:55.460
It's someone, some external thing being like,

02:09:55.460 --> 02:09:57.100
okay, I have to do this and then you have that moment

02:09:57.100 --> 02:09:59.260
of like, it sucks, but I guess I'll do it.

02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:01.420
If no one's there though, the problem with a procrastinator

02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:03.460
is they don't have that person in their head.

02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:05.500
Other people I think were raised with a sense of shame

02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:08.460
if they don't do stuff and that stick in their head

02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:09.780
is hugely helpful.

02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:10.740
I don't really have that.

02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:14.200
And so anyway, Alicia is sitting there next to me.

02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:16.420
It's not, she's doing her own work,

02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:18.180
but she can see my screen and she, of all people,

02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:19.660
knows exactly what I should be doing,

02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:21.300
what I shouldn't be doing.

02:10:21.300 --> 02:10:22.540
That's all it takes.

02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:24.820
The shame of just having her see me

02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:26.540
while she's sitting there not working would just be too,

02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:27.780
it's too weird and too embarrassing.

02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:29.740
So I get it done and it's amazing.

02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:31.620
It's like a game changer for me.

02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:34.780
So duct tape can solve, sometimes duct tape is enough,

02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:39.300
but I'm curious to, I'm still trying to, what is going on?

02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:40.140
Yeah.

02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:43.620
I think part of it is that we are actually wired.

02:10:43.620 --> 02:10:46.220
I think I'm being, I'm being very sane.

02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:47.780
Human actually is what's happening.

02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:48.860
You're not sane is not the right word.

02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:52.060
I'm being like, I'm being a natural human

02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:55.540
that we are not programmed to sit there and do homework

02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:58.620
of a certain kind that we get the results like

02:10:58.620 --> 02:10:59.660
six months later.

02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:03.100
Like that is not, so we're supposed to conserve energy

02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:05.060
and like fulfill our needs as we need them

02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:06.700
and like do immediate things.

02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:10.300
And we're overriding our natural ways

02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:12.060
when we wake up and get to it.

02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:14.500
And I think sometimes because the pain,

02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:15.980
I think a lot of times we're just avoiding suffering

02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:16.820
and a lot of, for a lot of people,

02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:19.380
the pain of not doing it is actually worse

02:11:19.380 --> 02:11:20.660
because they feel shame.

02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:22.220
So if they don't get up and take a jog

02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:23.580
and get up early and get to work,

02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:25.700
I'll feel like a bad person

02:11:25.700 --> 02:11:28.100
and that is worse than doing those things.

02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:29.540
And then it becomes a habit eventually

02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:31.260
and it becomes just easy, automatic.

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:33.260
It just becomes, I do it because that's what I do.

02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:35.100
But I think that if you don't have a lot of shame

02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:38.580
necessarily, the pain of doing those things is worse

02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:42.260
in that, in the immediate moment than not doing it.

02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:44.100
But I think that there's this feeling

02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:46.260
that you've captured with your body language

02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:48.940
and so on to the, like the,

02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:51.700
I don't want to do another set, that feeling,

02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.860
the people I've seen that are good at not procrastinating

02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:57.540
are the ones that have trained themselves to like

02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:00.020
the moment they would be having that feeling,

02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:03.820
they just, it's like Zen, like Sam Harris style Zen,

02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:05.540
you don't experience that feeling.

02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:06.940
You just march forward.

02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:09.820
Like I talked to Elon about this a lot actually offline.

02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:11.700
It's like, he doesn't have this.

02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:12.900
No, really not.

02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:16.020
It's the way I think, at least he talks about it

02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:18.100
and the way I think about it is it's like,

02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:20.340
you just pretend you're like a machine

02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:21.620
and running an algorithm.

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:24.580
Like, you know this, you should be doing this.

02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:26.060
Not because somebody told you or so on.

02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:28.500
This is probably the thing you want to do.

02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:30.380
Like look at the big picture of your life

02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:31.540
and just run the algorithm.

02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:32.740
Like ignore your feelings.

02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:33.580
Just run as if.

02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:35.260
Like just framing, frame it differently.

02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:36.100
Yeah.

02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:38.020
You know, yeah, you can frame it as like,

02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:40.780
it can feel like homework or it can feel like

02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:42.780
you're like, you're living your best life or something

02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:43.940
when you're doing your work.

02:12:43.940 --> 02:12:45.260
Yeah.

02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:46.340
Yeah, maybe reframe it.

02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:48.540
But I think ultimately is whatever reframing

02:12:48.540 --> 02:12:52.300
you need to do, you just need to do it for a few weeks

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:55.220
and that's how the habit is formed

02:12:55.260 --> 02:12:56.980
and you stick with it.

02:12:56.980 --> 02:13:01.980
Like I've, I'm now on a kick where I exercise every day.

02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:06.180
It doesn't matter what that exercise is.

02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:07.420
It's not serious.

02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:09.380
It could be 200 pushups.

02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:12.340
But it's a thing that like I make sure I exercise every day

02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:15.540
and it's become way, way easier because of the habit.

02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:19.660
And I just, and I don't like, at least with exercise

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:22.140
because it's easier to replicate that feeling.

02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:24.420
I don't allow myself to go like,

02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:25.500
I don't feel like doing this.

02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:26.340
Right.

02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:27.500
Well, I think about that, even just like little things

02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:29.300
like I brush my teeth before I go to bed

02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:30.340
and it's just a habit.

02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:31.180
Yeah.

02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:32.020
And it is effort.

02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:33.300
Like if it were something else,

02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:35.460
I would be like, oh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom

02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:36.300
and I'm gonna do that.

02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:37.700
And I'm just gonna like, I'm just gonna lie down right now.

02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:38.900
But it doesn't even cross my mind.

02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:41.420
It's just like that I just robotically go and do it.

02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:42.260
Yeah.

02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:43.660
And it almost has become like a nice routine.

02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:44.980
It's like, oh, this part of the night, you know,

02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:47.540
it's like a morning routine for me stuff is like,

02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:50.100
you know, that stuff is kind of just like automated.

02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:52.740
Yeah, it's funny cause you don't like go,

02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:54.460
like I don't think I've skipped many days.

02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:56.500
I don't think I skipped any days brushing my teeth.

02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:57.340
Right.

02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:59.100
Like, unless I didn't have a tooth part,

02:13:59.100 --> 02:14:00.660
like I was in the woods or something.

02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:01.500
And what is that?

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:02.980
Cause it's annoying.

02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:06.140
To me, there's, so the character that makes me procrastinate

02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:08.380
is the instant gratification monkey.

02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:09.580
That's what I've labeled him, right?

02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:11.300
And there's the rational decision maker

02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.420
and the instant gratification monkey

02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:14.180
and these battle with each other.

02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:18.100
But for procrastinating, the monkey wins.

02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:18.940
Yeah.

02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:20.820
I think the monkeys, you know,

02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:21.860
you read about this kind of stuff.

02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:25.940
I think that this kind of more primitive brain

02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:26.860
is always winning.

02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:28.220
And in non-procrastinators,

02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:30.700
that primitive brain is on board for some reason

02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:32.660
and isn't resisting.

02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:35.100
So, but when I think about brushing my teeth,

02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:36.740
it's like the monkey doesn't even think

02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:38.540
there's an option to not do it.

02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:40.420
So it doesn't even like get, there's no hope.

02:14:40.420 --> 02:14:41.860
The monkey has no hope there.

02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:43.180
So it doesn't even like get involved.

02:14:43.180 --> 02:14:44.340
And it's just like, yeah, yeah, no, we have to,

02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:46.820
just like kind of like robotically, just like, you know,

02:14:46.820 --> 02:14:48.060
it's kind of like Stockholm syndrome,

02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:50.460
just like, oh, no, no, I have to do this.

02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:51.820
It doesn't even like wake up.

02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:53.220
It's like, yeah, we're doing this now.

02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:54.940
For other things, the monkey's like, ooh, no, no, no,

02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:56.820
most days I can win this one.

02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:01.820
And so the monkey puts up that like fierce resistance

02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:03.860
and it's like, it's a lot of it's like

02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:05.660
the initial transition.

02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:09.060
So I think of it as like jumping in a cold pool

02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:12.580
where it's like, I will spend the whole day

02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:15.100
pacing around the side of the pool in my bathing suit,

02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:17.580
just being like, I don't want to have that one second

02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:18.780
when you first jump in and it sucks.

02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:20.860
And then once you're, once I'm in,

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:21.860
once I jump in, I'm usually, you know,

02:15:21.860 --> 02:15:23.300
once I start writing, I'm suddenly,

02:15:23.300 --> 02:15:24.620
I'm like, oh, this isn't so bad.

02:15:24.620 --> 02:15:25.460
Okay, I'm kind of into it.

02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:27.020
And then sometimes you can't tear me away.

02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:29.340
You know, then I suddenly, I'm like, I get into a flow.

02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:31.380
So it's like, once I get into cold water, I don't mind it,

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:35.060
but I will spend hours standing around the side of the pool.

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:36.820
And by the way, I do this in a more literal sense.

02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:40.440
When I go to the gym with a trainer in 45 minutes,

02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:41.980
I do a full, full ass workout.

02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:44.820
And it's not because I'm having a good time,

02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:47.940
but it's because it's that, ugh,

02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:49.100
you have to go to class feeling, right?

02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.540
But when I go to the gym alone,

02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:55.460
I will literally do a set and then dick around my phone

02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:57.380
for 10 minutes before the next set.

02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:59.660
And I'll spend over an hour there and do way less.

02:15:59.660 --> 02:16:01.940
So it is the transition.

02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:03.540
Once I'm actually doing the set, I'm never like,

02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:04.460
I don't want to stop in the middle.

02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:05.580
Now it's just like, I'm going to do this.

02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:07.020
And I feel happy I just did it.

02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:09.140
So it's something, there's something about transitions

02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:11.460
that is very, that's why procrastinators are late

02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:12.980
a lot of places.

02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:14.940
It's, I will procrastinate getting ready

02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:16.900
to go to the airport,

02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:18.260
even though I know I should leave at three,

02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:19.220
so I can not be stressed.

02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:22.460
I'll leave at 3.36 and I'll be super stressed.

02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:24.700
Once I'm on the way to the airport,

02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:26.340
immediately I'm like, why didn't I do this earlier?

02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:28.660
Now I'm back on my phone doing what I was doing.

02:16:28.660 --> 02:16:31.300
I just had to get in the damn car or whatever.

02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:35.460
So yeah, there's some very, very odd irrational.

02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:38.620
Yeah, like I was waiting for you to come

02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:40.500
and you said that you're running a few minutes late.

02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:45.500
And I was like, I was like, I'll go get you a coffee

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:49.060
because I can't possibly be the one who's early.

02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:50.420
I can't, I don't understand.

02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:51.780
I'm always late to stuff.

02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:54.060
And I know it's disrespectful

02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:55.300
in the eyes of a lot of people.

02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:56.140
I can't help.

02:16:56.140 --> 02:16:58.140
It's not, you know what I'm doing ahead of it?

02:16:58.140 --> 02:17:00.140
It's not like I don't care about the people.

02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:03.020
I'm often like, you know, for like this conference,

02:17:03.020 --> 02:17:04.700
I'd be preparing more.

02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:08.180
Like it's like, I obviously care about the person,

02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:09.020
but for some-

02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:09.860
Yeah, it's misinterpreted.

02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:13.060
It is like, there are some people that like show up late

02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:15.860
because they kind of like that quality in themselves.

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:16.700
That's a dick, right?

02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:17.660
There's a lot of those people,

02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:20.340
but more often it's someone who shows up frazzled

02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:22.740
and they feel awful and they're furious at themselves.

02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:23.580
They're so regretful.

02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:24.400
Exactly.

02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:25.240
I mean, that's me.

02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:27.780
And also all you have to do is look at those people alone

02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:29.780
running through the airport, right?

02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:31.180
They're not being disrespectful to anyone there.

02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:33.420
They just inflicted this on themselves.

02:17:33.420 --> 02:17:34.260
This is hilarious.

02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:35.300
Yeah.

02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:38.620
You've tweeted a quote by James Baldwin saying,

02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:40.660
I imagine one of the reasons people cling

02:17:40.660 --> 02:17:45.660
to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense

02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:49.580
once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with the pain.

02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:53.820
What has been a painful but formative experience

02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:56.580
in your life or what's the flavor,

02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:58.980
the shape of your pain that fuels you?

02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:02.660
I mean, honestly, the first thing that jumped to mind

02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:06.260
is my own like battles against myself to get my work done

02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:07.660
because it affects everything.

02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:09.700
When I, I just took five years in this book

02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:11.260
and granted it's a beast.

02:18:11.260 --> 02:18:13.420
Like I probably would have taken two or three years

02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:14.520
but it didn't need to take five.

02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:16.660
And that was a lot of, not just, you know,

02:18:16.660 --> 02:18:17.900
not just that I'm not working,

02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:19.900
it's that I'm over researching.

02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:22.400
I'm making it, I'm adding in things I shouldn't

02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:23.840
because I'm perfectionist, you know,

02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:25.700
being a perfectionist about like, oh, well, I learned that.

02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:26.840
Now I want to get it in there.

02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:28.040
I know I'm going to end up cutting it later.

02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:30.980
Just, you know, or I over outline, you know,

02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:31.900
something, you know, until, you know,

02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:33.980
trying to get it perfect when I know that's not possible.

02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:36.700
So making a lot of immature kind of,

02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.820
like I'm not actually that much of a writing amateur.

02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:40.700
I've written, including my old blog.

02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:42.300
I've been a writer for 15 years.

02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:43.300
I know what I'm doing.

02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:45.940
I could advise other writers really well.

02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:47.940
And yet I do a bunch of amateur things

02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:50.300
that I know while I'm doing them is an,

02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:51.260
I know I'm being an amateur.

02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:55.620
So that A, it hurts the actual product.

02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:59.380
It makes, you know, B, it's waste your precious time.

02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:01.820
C, when you're mad at yourself,

02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:05.900
when you're in a negative, you know, self-defeating spiral,

02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:09.980
it almost inevitably will, you'll be less good to others.

02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:12.260
Like, you know, I'll just, I used to, you know,

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:15.620
early on in my now marriage,

02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:17.220
one of the things we always used to do

02:19:17.220 --> 02:19:19.020
is I used to plan mystery dates.

02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:20.820
You know, New York city, great, great place for this.

02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:22.980
I'd find some weird little adventure for us.

02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:24.700
You know, it could be anything.

02:19:24.700 --> 02:19:25.700
And I wouldn't tell her what it was.

02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:27.900
I said, I reserving you for Thursday night, you know,

02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:29.060
at seven, okay.

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:31.420
And it was such a fun part of our relationship.

02:19:31.420 --> 02:19:33.860
Started writing this book and got into a really bad,

02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:36.380
you know, personal space where it was like in my head,

02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:38.220
I was like, I can't do anything until this is done.

02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:39.060
You know, like, no.

02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:42.580
And I just stopped like ever valuing like,

02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:44.220
like joy of any kind.

02:19:44.220 --> 02:19:47.140
Like I was like, no, that's for when I'm done.

02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:49.940
And that's a trap or very quickly, you know,

02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:50.780
cause I always think, you know,

02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:51.940
I think it's gonna be a six months away,

02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:53.780
but actually five years later, I'm like, wow,

02:19:53.780 --> 02:19:55.780
I really wasn't living fully.

02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:58.260
And for five years is not, we don't live very long.

02:19:58.260 --> 02:19:59.820
Like you're talking about your prime decades.

02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:01.780
Like that's like a sixth of my prime years.

02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:04.900
Like, wow, like that's a huge loss.

02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:06.980
So to me that was excruciating and you know,

02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:11.740
and it was a bad pattern, a very unproductive,

02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:13.020
unhelpful pattern for me,

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:15.580
which is I'd wake up in the morning in this great mood,

02:20:15.580 --> 02:20:18.140
great mood every morning, wake up, thrilled to be awake.

02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:19.420
I have the whole day ahead of me.

02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:21.180
I'm gonna get so much work done today.

02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:23.900
And, but you know, first I'm gonna do all these other things

02:20:23.900 --> 02:20:24.740
and it's all gonna be great.

02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:27.900
And then I ended up kind of failing for the day

02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:30.300
with those goals, sometimes miserably,

02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:31.940
sometimes only partially.

02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:35.340
And then I get in bed probably a couple hours later

02:20:35.340 --> 02:20:36.180
than I want to.

02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:39.060
And that's when all of the real reality hits me.

02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:42.060
Suddenly so much regret, so much anxiety,

02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:43.220
furious at myself,

02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:45.180
wishing I could take a time machine back three months,

02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:46.740
six months a year,

02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:49.020
or just even to the beginning of that day.

02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:51.940
And just tossing and turning now.

02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:53.180
I mean, this is a very bad place.

02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:54.020
That's what I said, suffering,

02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:56.780
real procrastinators suffer in a very serious way.

02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:00.100
So look, you know, I know this probably sounds

02:21:00.100 --> 02:21:02.140
like a lot of like first world problems and it is,

02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:03.580
but it's real suffering as well.

02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:06.940
Like it's, so to me, it's like,

02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:11.540
it's painful because you're not being,

02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:13.220
you're not being as good a friend or a spouse

02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:14.340
or whatever as you could be.

02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:16.100
You're also not treating yourself very well.

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:17.940
You're usually not being very healthy in these moments.

02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:20.340
You know, you're often, and you're not being,

02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:21.420
I'm not being good to my readers.

02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:22.980
So it's just a lot of this.

02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:27.300
And it's like, it feels like it's one small tweak away.

02:21:27.300 --> 02:21:28.620
Sometimes it's like, that's what I said.

02:21:28.620 --> 02:21:31.220
It's like, you just suddenly are just doing that nine to 12

02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:32.300
and you get in that habit.

02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:33.700
Everything else falls into place.

02:21:33.700 --> 02:21:35.380
All of this reverses.

02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:39.060
So I feel hopeful, but it's like, it is a,

02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:41.220
I have not figured, I haven't fixed the boat yet.

02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:43.420
I have some good duct tape though.

02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:45.460
And you also don't want to romanticize it

02:21:45.460 --> 02:21:48.460
because it is true that some of the greats in history,

02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:51.260
especially writers suffer from all the same stuff.

02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:52.820
Like they weren't quite able,

02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:56.660
you might only write for two or three hours a day,

02:21:56.660 --> 02:22:00.660
but the rest of the day is often spent kind of tortured.

02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:01.500
Well, right.

02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:03.540
This is the irrational thing is if I,

02:22:03.540 --> 02:22:05.100
and this goes for a lot of people's jobs,

02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:07.220
people, especially who work for themselves,

02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:10.260
you'd be shocked how much you could wake up at nine

02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:12.020
or eight or seven or whatever.

02:22:12.020 --> 02:22:13.380
Get to work and stop at one,

02:22:13.380 --> 02:22:15.460
but you're really focused in those hours.

02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:20.100
One or two and do 25 really focused hours of stuff,

02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:20.940
product stuff a week.

02:22:20.940 --> 02:22:24.020
And then there's 112 waking hours in the week, right?

02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:27.220
So we're talking about 80 something hours of free time.

02:22:27.220 --> 02:22:30.140
You can live, if you're just really focused in your,

02:22:30.140 --> 02:22:31.420
yin and yang of your time,

02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:34.140
and that's my goal is black and white time.

02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:37.300
I really focused time and then totally like

02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:39.460
clean conscience free time.

02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:40.780
Right now I have neither, it's a lot of gray.

02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:42.420
It's a lot of, I should be working, but I'm not.

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:43.700
Oh, I'm wasting this time.

02:22:43.700 --> 02:22:44.540
This is bad.

02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:45.620
And that's just as massive.

02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:49.100
So if you can just get really good at the black

02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:50.380
and the white, so you just wake up

02:22:50.380 --> 02:22:51.580
and it's just like full work.

02:22:51.580 --> 02:22:53.580
And then I think a lot of people could have like

02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:54.420
all this free time,

02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:55.900
but instead I'll do those same three hours.

02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:56.740
It's like you said,

02:22:56.740 --> 02:22:58.180
I'll do them really late at night or whatever,

02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:00.100
after having tortured myself the whole day

02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:01.060
and not had any fun.

02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:03.100
It's not like I'm having fun.

02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:04.620
I call it the dark playground, by the way,

02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:06.860
which is where you are when you know you should be working,

02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:08.660
but you're doing something else.

02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:10.740
You're doing something fun on paper,

02:23:10.740 --> 02:23:12.700
but it's never, it feels awful.

02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:14.620
And so yeah, I spent a lot of time in the dark.

02:23:14.620 --> 02:23:16.020
And you know you shouldn't be doing it

02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:18.060
and you still do it and yeah.

02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:21.340
It's not clean conscience fun, it's toxic.

02:23:21.340 --> 02:23:23.940
And I think that there's something about,

02:23:23.940 --> 02:23:25.420
you're draining yourself all the time.

02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:26.820
And if you just did your focused hours

02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:28.780
and then if you actually have good, clean fun,

02:23:28.780 --> 02:23:29.620
fun can be anything.

02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:31.460
Reading a book can be hanging out with someone

02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:32.300
who can be really fun.

02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:35.060
You can go and do something cool in the city.

02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:37.060
That is critical.

02:23:37.060 --> 02:23:39.060
You're recharging some part of your psyche there.

02:23:39.060 --> 02:23:40.980
And I think it makes it easier to actually work the next day.

02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:42.500
And I say this from the experiences

02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:44.300
when I have had good stretches.

02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:46.660
It's like, you know what it is?

02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:48.420
It's like, you feel like you're fist pounding.

02:23:48.420 --> 02:23:50.340
One part of your brain is fist pounding the other part.

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:54.860
Like you're like, we treat ourselves well.

02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:56.060
Like this is how you're internally feel.

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.020
Like I treat myself.

02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:58.420
And it's like, yeah, no, it's work time.

02:23:58.420 --> 02:23:59.820
And then later you're like, now it's play time.

02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:01.060
And it's like, okay, back to work.

02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:02.220
And you're in this very healthy,

02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:04.140
like parent-child relationship in your head

02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:06.980
versus like this constant conflict.

02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:08.700
And like the kid doesn't respect the parent

02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:11.020
and the parent hates the kid and like, yeah.

02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:11.900
And you're right.

02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:14.580
It always feels like it's like one fix away.

02:24:14.580 --> 02:24:15.940
So that there's hope.

02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:18.660
I mean, I guess, I mean,

02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:21.740
so much of what you said just rings so true.

02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:24.260
I guess I have the same kind of hope.

02:24:24.260 --> 02:24:27.740
But you know, this podcast is very regular.

02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:30.140
I mean, I'm impressed.

02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:32.540
And I think partially what,

02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:34.420
there is a bit of a duct tape solution here,

02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:35.420
which is you just,

02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:37.780
because it's always easy to schedule stuff

02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:39.140
for the future for myself, right?

02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:40.100
Because that's future Tim.

02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:42.500
And future Tim is not my problem.

02:24:42.500 --> 02:24:44.820
So I'll schedule all kinds of shit for future Tim.

02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:48.380
And I will then not do it.

02:24:48.380 --> 02:24:51.740
But in this case, you can schedule podcasts

02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:53.020
and you have to show up.

02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:53.860
Yeah, you have to show up.

02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:55.060
Right, it seems like a good medium

02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:55.900
for procrastinating.

02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:57.060
But this is not my,

02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:58.020
this is what I do for fun.

02:24:58.020 --> 02:24:58.860
I know.

02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:00.540
But at least this is the kind of thing,

02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:02.540
especially if it's not your main thing.

02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:03.540
Especially if it's not your main thing,

02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:05.100
it's the kind of thing that you would dream of doing

02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:06.420
and want to do and never do.

02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:10.100
And I feel like your regular production here

02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:12.220
is a sign that something is working,

02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:13.380
at least in this regard.

02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:14.220
Yeah, in this regard,

02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:16.420
I guess I'm sure you have this same kind of thing

02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:17.260
with the podcast.

02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:19.020
In fact, because you're gonna be doing the podcast,

02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:20.500
it's possible the podcast becomes

02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:22.700
what the podcast is for me.

02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:24.380
This is you procrastinate.

02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:25.700
If you think about being 80

02:25:25.700 --> 02:25:27.420
and if you can get into that person's head

02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:28.420
and look back and be like,

02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:30.780
and just deep regret, you just,

02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:32.500
you know, yearning, you could do anything

02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:34.700
to just go back and have done this differently.

02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:36.100
That is desperation.

02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:37.140
It's just, you don't feel it yet.

02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:38.740
It's not in you yet.

02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:40.300
The other thing you could do is if you have a partner,

02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:41.340
if you want to partner with someone,

02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:45.060
now you could say, we meet these 15 hours every week

02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:46.460
and that point you're gonna get it done.

02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:48.980
So working with someone can help.

02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:51.260
Yeah, that's why they say like a co-founder

02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:52.820
is really powerful for many reasons,

02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:54.580
but that's kind of one of them.

02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:57.060
Because to actually for the startup case,

02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:00.940
you, unlike writing perhaps,

02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:03.260
it's really at like a hundred hour plus thing.

02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:07.060
Like once you really launch, you go all in.

02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:09.420
Like everything else just disappears.

02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:11.900
Like you can't even have a hope of a balanced life

02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:12.740
for a little bit.

02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:15.380
So, and their co-founder really helps.

02:26:15.380 --> 02:26:16.380
That's the idea.

02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:20.940
When you, you're one of the most interesting people

02:26:20.940 --> 02:26:21.820
on the internet.

02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:26.580
So as a writer, you look out into the future.

02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:30.460
Do you dream about certain things you want to still create?

02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:34.180
Is there, is there projects that you want to write?

02:26:34.180 --> 02:26:37.460
Is there movies you want to write or direct or?

02:26:37.460 --> 02:26:38.700
Endless.

02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:40.980
So it's just endless sea of ideas.

02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:44.140
No, there's specific list of things that really excite me,

02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:46.220
but it's a big list that I know

02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:47.340
I'll never get through them all.

02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:51.580
And that's part of why the last five years really like,

02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:54.340
when I feel like I'm not moving as quickly as I could,

02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:57.180
it bothers me because I have so much genuine excitement

02:26:57.180 --> 02:26:58.380
to try so many different things

02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:00.220
and I get so much joy from finishing things.

02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:03.620
I don't like doing things, but a lot of writers are like that.

02:27:03.620 --> 02:27:06.580
Publishing something is greatly, is hugely joyful

02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:08.140
and makes it all worth it.

02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:10.020
Or just finishing something you're proud of,

02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:11.540
putting it out there and have people appreciate it.

02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:13.300
It's like the best thing in the world, right?

02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:15.100
You know, a lot of every kid makes some little bargain

02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:17.740
with themselves, has a little, you know, a dream or,

02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:19.060
you know, something.

02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:21.500
And I feel like when I'm, when I do something

02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:24.060
that I make something in this, you know, for me,

02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:26.740
it's been mostly writing and I feel proud of it.

02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:27.700
And I put it out there.

02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:29.140
I feel like I like, again,

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:30.980
I'm like fist pounding my seven-year-old self.

02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:33.580
Like there's a little like, I'm, I like,

02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:35.500
I owe it to myself to do certain things.

02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:36.860
And I just did one of the things I owe.

02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:38.060
I just paid off some debt to myself.

02:27:38.980 --> 02:27:40.260
I owed it and I paid it and it feels great.

02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:42.700
It feels like very like, you just feel very,

02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:43.900
a lot of inner peace when you do it.

02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:46.140
So the more things I can do, you know,

02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:47.460
and I just have fun doing it, right?

02:27:47.460 --> 02:27:48.660
And so I just, it's, for me,

02:27:48.660 --> 02:27:50.860
that includes a lot more writing.

02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:53.460
I just, you know, short, short, not short blog posts.

02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:54.460
I write very long blog posts,

02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:57.300
but basically short writing in the form of long blog posts

02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:59.100
is a great, I love that medium.

02:27:59.100 --> 02:28:00.860
I wanna do a lot more of that.

02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:01.900
Books yet to be seen.

02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:03.260
I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna have another book

02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:04.100
I'm gonna do right after

02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:05.340
and we'll see if I like those two.

02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:07.620
And if I do, I'll do more, otherwise I won't.

02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:08.740
But I also wanna try other mediums.

02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:10.860
I wanna make more videos.

02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:14.540
I want to, I did a little travel series once.

02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:15.380
I love doing that.

02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:16.740
I wanna do, you know, more of that.

02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:18.500
It's almost like a vlog.

02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:21.260
No, it was, I let readers in a survey

02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:24.780
pick five countries they wanted me to go to.

02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:25.620
That's awesome.

02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:27.940
And they picked, they sent me to weird places.

02:28:27.940 --> 02:28:30.780
They sent me, I went to Siberia.

02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:32.460
I went to Japan.

02:28:32.460 --> 02:28:34.740
I went from there to, this is all in a row,

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:37.380
into Nigeria, from there to Iraq

02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:39.580
and from there to Greenland.

02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:41.540
And then I went back to New York,

02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:43.980
like two weeks in each place.

02:28:43.980 --> 02:28:45.180
And I got to, you know, each one,

02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:47.260
I got to, you know, have some weird experiences.

02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:48.820
I tried to like really dig in

02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:51.940
and have like, you know, some interesting experiences.

02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:52.900
And then I wrote about it.

02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:54.260
And I taught readers a little bit

02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:55.340
about the history of these places.

02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:56.700
And it was just, I love doing that.

02:28:56.700 --> 02:28:57.540
I love writing.

02:28:57.540 --> 02:28:59.260
So, you know, and I'm like, oh man,

02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:02.180
like I haven't done one of those in so long.

02:29:02.180 --> 02:29:06.140
And then I have a big like desire to do fictional stuff.

02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:07.700
Write a sci-fi at some point.

02:29:07.700 --> 02:29:09.740
And I would love to write a musical.

02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:10.940
That's actually what I was doing before,

02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:14.380
Wait But Why, I was with a partner, Ryan Langer.

02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:15.860
We were halfway through a musical

02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:19.820
and he got tied up with his other musical

02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:21.420
and Wait But Why started taking off.

02:29:21.420 --> 02:29:22.740
And we just haven't gotten back to it,

02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:24.260
but it's such a fun medium.

02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:26.540
So it's such a silly medium, but it's so fun.

02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:28.460
So you think about all of these mediums

02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:30.700
on which you can be creative and create something

02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:32.620
and you like the variety of it.

02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:37.180
It's just that if there's a chance on a new medium,

02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:38.820
I could do something good.

02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:40.260
I wanna do it, I wanna try it.

02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:42.900
It sounds like so gratifying and so fun.

02:29:42.900 --> 02:29:45.500
I think it's fun to just watch you actually sample these.

02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:47.740
So I can't wait for your podcast.

02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:49.460
I'll be listening to all of them.

02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:52.220
I mean, that's a cool medium to see like where it goes.

02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:54.340
The cool thing about podcasting or making videos,

02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:56.860
especially with a super creative mind like yours,

02:29:56.860 --> 02:29:59.620
you don't really know what you're gonna make of it

02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:01.180
until you try it.

02:30:01.180 --> 02:30:03.020
Yeah, podcasts I'm really excited about,

02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:06.540
but I'm like, I like going on other people's podcasts.

02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:08.180
And I never tried having my own.

02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:09.980
So there's this with every medium,

02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:13.180
there's the challenges of how the sausage is made.

02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:15.380
So like the challenges of the challenge of actually.

02:30:15.380 --> 02:30:16.700
Yeah, but it's also, I like to like,

02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:19.420
I'll go on like, as you know, long ass monologues.

02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:21.700
And you can't do that if you're the interviewer,

02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:23.420
like you're not supposed to do that as much.

02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:27.700
So I have to like rein it in and that might be hard,

02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:28.540
but we'll see.

02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:29.500
You could also do solo type stuff.

02:30:29.500 --> 02:30:31.220
Yeah, maybe I'll do a little of each.

02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:32.060
You know what's funny?

02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:34.180
I mean, some of my favorite is more like solo,

02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:36.100
but there's like a sidekick.

02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:40.620
So you're having a conversation, but you're like friends,

02:30:40.620 --> 02:30:43.220
but it's really you ranting,

02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:46.140
which I think you'd be extremely good at.

02:30:46.140 --> 02:30:46.980
That's funny, yeah.

02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:48.860
Or even if it's 50-50, that's fine.

02:30:48.860 --> 02:30:51.900
Like if it's just a friend who I wanna like really riff with,

02:30:51.900 --> 02:30:55.420
I just don't, I don't like interviewing someone,

02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:57.220
which I won't, that's not what the podcast will be,

02:30:57.220 --> 02:30:58.060
but I can't help.

02:30:58.060 --> 02:30:59.980
I've tried moderating panels before

02:30:59.980 --> 02:31:01.060
and I cannot help myself.

02:31:01.060 --> 02:31:03.380
I have to get involved and no one likes a moderator

02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:04.220
who's too involved.

02:31:04.220 --> 02:31:05.060
It's very unappealing.

02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:07.660
So I, you know, interviewing someone and I'm like,

02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:10.020
I can't, I don't even know, I just, it's not my,

02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:11.580
I can grill someone, but that's different.

02:31:11.580 --> 02:31:13.780
That's my curiosity being like, wait, how about this?

02:31:13.780 --> 02:31:14.620
And I interrupt them and I'm trying to.

02:31:14.620 --> 02:31:17.100
Yeah, I see the way your brain works is hilarious.

02:31:17.100 --> 02:31:17.940
It's awesome.

02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:19.980
It's like lights up with fire and excitement.

02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.860
Yeah, I actually, I love listening.

02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:24.140
I like watching people, I like listening to people.

02:31:24.140 --> 02:31:26.780
So this is like me right now having just listening

02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:27.940
to a podcast.

02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:29.780
This is me listening to your podcast right now.

02:31:29.780 --> 02:31:30.820
I like listening to a podcast

02:31:30.820 --> 02:31:31.860
because then it's not even like,

02:31:31.860 --> 02:31:34.020
but once I'm in the room, I suddenly can't help myself.

02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:35.420
I'm jumping in.

02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:38.420
Okay, big last ridiculous question.

02:31:38.420 --> 02:31:40.380
What is the meaning of life?

02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:42.420
The meaning of like an individual life.

02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:45.780
Your existence here on earth or maybe broadly

02:31:45.780 --> 02:31:49.380
this whole thing we've got going on, descendants of apes,

02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:50.460
busy creating.

02:31:50.460 --> 02:31:51.300
Yeah, well there's, yeah.

02:31:51.300 --> 02:31:55.620
For me, I feel like I want to be around as long as I can.

02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:57.900
If I can do some kind of crazy life extension

02:31:57.900 --> 02:31:59.100
or upload myself, I'm gonna,

02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:03.300
because who doesn't wanna see how cool the year 3000 is?

02:32:03.300 --> 02:32:04.140
Imagine.

02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:06.340
You did say mortality was not appealing.

02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:08.140
No, it's not appealing at all to me.

02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:10.220
Now it's ultimately appealing.

02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:12.300
As I said, no one wants eternal life, I believe,

02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:14.220
if they understood what eternity really was.

02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:15.940
And I did Graham's number as a post

02:32:15.940 --> 02:32:18.180
and I was like, okay, no one wants to live that many years.

02:32:18.180 --> 02:32:19.380
But I'd like to choose.

02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:20.220
I'd like to say, you know what?

02:32:20.220 --> 02:32:21.660
I'm truly over it now and I'm gonna have,

02:32:21.660 --> 02:32:23.740
you know, at that point we'd have our whole society

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:25.620
we'd have a ceremony.

02:32:25.620 --> 02:32:28.060
We'd have a whole process of someone signing off

02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:29.420
and you know, it would be beautiful

02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:30.260
and it wouldn't be sad.

02:32:30.260 --> 02:32:33.500
Well, I think you'd be super depressed by that point.

02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:35.340
Like who's gonna sign off when they're doing pretty good?

02:32:35.340 --> 02:32:36.260
Maybe, maybe, yes.

02:32:36.260 --> 02:32:37.500
Okay, maybe it's dark.

02:32:37.500 --> 02:32:39.340
But at least, but the point is if I'm happy,

02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:40.940
I can stay around for five, you know,

02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:42.740
I'm thinking 50th century sounds great.

02:32:42.740 --> 02:32:44.140
Like, I don't know if I want more than that.

02:32:44.140 --> 02:32:45.540
50 sounds like a right number.

02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:47.860
And so if you're thinking, if you would sign up for 50,

02:32:47.860 --> 02:32:50.500
if you had a choice, one is what I get that is bullshit.

02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:52.780
Like if you want, if you're someone who wants 50,

02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:55.540
one is a hideous number, right?

02:32:55.540 --> 02:32:56.860
You know, anyway.

02:32:56.860 --> 02:33:01.140
So for me personally, I wanna be around as long as I can.

02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:03.020
And then honestly, the reason I love writing,

02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:05.300
the thing that I love most is like,

02:33:05.300 --> 02:33:08.540
is like a warm fuzzy connection with other people, right?

02:33:08.540 --> 02:33:11.820
And that can be my friends and it can be readers.

02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:13.940
And that's why I would never wanna be like a journalist

02:33:13.940 --> 02:33:16.740
where their personality is like hidden behind the writing

02:33:17.780 --> 02:33:19.660
or like even a biographer, you know,

02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:21.280
there's a lot of people who are great writers,

02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:23.680
but it's, I like to personally connect.

02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:25.400
And if I can take something that's in my head

02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:27.080
and other people can say, oh my God, I think that too.

02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:28.440
And this made me feel so much better.

02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:29.280
It made me feel seen.

02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:30.240
Like that feels amazing.

02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:33.960
And I just feel like we're all having such a weird

02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:35.960
common experience on this one little rock

02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:38.880
in this one little moment of time where this weird,

02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:41.600
these weird four limb beings, and we're all the same.

02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.920
And it's like, we're all, we all, the human experience.

02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:46.200
So I feel like so many of us suffer in the same ways

02:33:46.200 --> 02:33:48.080
and we're all going through a lot of the same things.

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:50.440
And to me, it is very, if I lived,

02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:52.320
it was on my deathbed and I feel like I had like,

02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:54.560
I had a ton of human connection

02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:56.520
and like shared a lot of common experience

02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:01.440
and made a lot of other people feel like not alone.

02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:02.780
Do you feel that as a writer?

02:34:02.780 --> 02:34:07.780
Do you like hear and feel like the inspiration

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:10.440
like all the people that you make smile

02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:11.400
and all the people you inspire?

02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:13.480
Honestly, not sometimes, you know,

02:34:13.480 --> 02:34:15.320
when we did an in-person event and I, you know,

02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:18.120
meet a bunch of people and it's incredibly gratifying

02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:19.640
or, you know, you just, you know, you get emails,

02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:22.320
but I think it is easy to forget that how many people,

02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:25.480
sometimes you're just sitting there alone typing,

02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:26.920
dealing with your procrastination.

02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:28.240
But that's why publishing is so gratifying

02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:30.320
because that's the moment when all this connection happens.

02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:32.240
And especially if I had to put my finger on it,

02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:35.480
it's like, it's having a bunch of people who feel lonely

02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:37.080
and they're like, existence is all realized,

02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:38.520
like all, you know, connect, right?

02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:40.240
So that, if I do a lot of that,

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:43.320
and that includes, of course, my actual spending, you know,

02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:45.440
a lot of really high quality time with friends and family

02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:50.200
and like, and make the whole thing as heartbreaking

02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:51.960
as like mortality in life can be,

02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:53.480
make the whole thing like fun

02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:55.720
and at least we can like laugh at ourselves together

02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:56.960
while going through it.

02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:58.520
Yeah, that to me is that, yeah.

02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:02.680
And then your last blog post will be written from Mars

02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:05.480
as you get the bad news that you're not able to return

02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:07.760
because of the malfunction in the rocket.

02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:09.760
Yeah, I would like to go to Mars and like go there

02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:11.240
for a week and be like, yeah, here we are.

02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:12.080
And then come back.

02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:13.560
No, I know that's what you want.

02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:14.840
Staying there, yeah.

02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:15.760
And that's fine, by the way.

02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:19.240
If I, yeah, so you think you're picturing me alone on Mars

02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:21.520
as the first person there and then it malfunctions.

02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:23.240
Right, no, you were supposed to return,

02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:24.280
but it malfunctions.

02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:28.000
And then there's this, so it's both the hope,

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.600
the awe that you experienced,

02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:32.480
which is how the blog starts.

02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:35.000
And then it's the overwhelming,

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.120
like feeling of existential dread,

02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:41.240
but then it returns to like the love of humanity.

02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:43.800
Well, that's the thing is, if I could be writing,

02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:44.920
and actually like writing something

02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:46.080
that people would read back on Earth,

02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:47.840
it would make it feel so much better.

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:48.760
You know, if I were just alone

02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:50.640
and no one was gonna realize what happened.

02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:51.680
No, no, no, you get to write.

02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:53.240
No, no, it's perfectly safe.

02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:54.960
Also, that would bring out great writing.

02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:55.800
Yeah, I think so.

02:35:55.800 --> 02:35:57.000
If you're deathbed on Mars alone.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.320
I think so.

02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:02.840
Well, that's exactly the future I hope for you, Tim.

02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:04.560
All right, this was an incredible conversation.

02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:06.640
You're a really special human being, Tim.

02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:09.040
Thank you so much for spending

02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:10.160
your really valuable time with me.

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:11.920
I can't wait to hear your podcast.

02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:15.320
I can't wait to read your next blog post,

02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:17.280
which you said in a Twitter reply,

02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:21.840
you'll get more to after the book,

02:36:21.840 --> 02:36:24.600
which add that to the long list of ideas

02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:26.720
to procrastinate about.

02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:28.720
Tim, thanks so much for talking to me, man.

02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:41.400
from Tim Urban himself.

02:36:42.440 --> 02:36:44.920
Be humbler about what you know,

02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:47.440
more confident about what's possible,

02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:50.600
and less afraid of things that don't matter.

02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:54.080
Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
