00:00.000 --> 00:04.920
The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy was the economic argument that there would

00:04.920 --> 00:08.520
be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall.

00:08.520 --> 00:14.080
That tendency for the rate of profit to fall would lead to capitalists battening down on

00:14.080 --> 00:21.240
workers harder, paying them less than their subsistence or revolt by workers against this,

00:21.240 --> 00:25.800
and then you would get socialism on the other side.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.560
What he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role in his

00:29.560 --> 00:32.640
explanation of why socialism would have to come about.

00:32.640 --> 00:37.720
If you look at Marx's own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen in England.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.200
The advanced economies would be first to go through the revolution.

00:41.200 --> 00:45.720
The socialist, the primitive economies would have to go through a capitalist transition,

00:45.720 --> 00:49.040
and this is the difference between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.080
So the Mensheviks, when Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family, the Mensheviks

00:53.080 --> 00:55.560
believed you had to go through a capitalist phase.

00:55.560 --> 00:58.920
Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it becomes socialist.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.680
The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go.

01:03.680 --> 01:08.000
The following is a conversation with Steve Kean, a brilliant economist that criticizes

01:08.000 --> 01:13.480
much of modern economics and proposes new theories and models that integrate some ideas

01:13.480 --> 01:19.120
and ditch others from very thinkers, from Karl Marx to John Maynard Keynes to Hyman

01:19.120 --> 01:20.120
Minsky.

01:20.120 --> 01:25.920
In fact, a lot of our conversation is about Karl Marx and Marxian economics.

01:25.920 --> 01:32.120
He has been a scholar of Karl Marx's work for many years, so this was a fascinating

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
exploration.

01:33.120 --> 01:38.160
He has written several books I recommend, including The New Economics and Manifesto

01:38.160 --> 01:41.800
and Debunking Economics.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.640
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.320
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:47.320 --> 01:51.600
And now, dear friends, here's Steve Kean.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.560
Let's start with a big question.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.840
What is economics?

01:55.840 --> 01:59.560
Or maybe what is or should be the goal of economics?

01:59.560 --> 02:03.440
Well, it should be to understand how human civilization comes about and how it can be

02:03.440 --> 02:05.680
maintained.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.120
And that's not what it's been at all.

02:08.120 --> 02:12.320
So we have a discipline which has the right name and the wrong soul.

02:12.320 --> 02:13.640
What is the soul of economics?

02:13.640 --> 02:20.360
The soul of economics really is to explain how do we manage to build a civilization that

02:20.840 --> 02:30.240
is so far above the energy and consumption and knowledge levels of the base environment

02:30.240 --> 02:31.240
of the earth?

02:31.240 --> 02:35.400
Because if you think about, and this is actually work I've learned from Tim Garrett, who's

02:35.400 --> 02:38.920
one of my research colleagues, who's an atmospheric physicist.

02:38.920 --> 02:46.120
And his idea is that we exploit these high-grade energy sources from the sun itself to coal,

02:46.520 --> 02:47.920
nuclear, et cetera, et cetera.

02:47.920 --> 02:51.920
Which means we can maintain a level of human civilization well above what we'd have if

02:51.920 --> 02:55.380
we were just still running around with rocks and stones and spears.

02:55.380 --> 03:02.000
So it's that elevation above the base level of the planet, which is human civilization.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.440
And if we didn't have this energy we were exploiting, if we didn't use the environment

03:06.440 --> 03:10.800
to elevate ourselves above what's possible in the background, then you and I wouldn't

03:10.800 --> 03:13.360
be talking into microphones.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.120
We might be doing drumbeats and stuff like this, but we wouldn't be having the sort

03:17.120 --> 03:18.660
of conversation we have.

03:18.660 --> 03:21.520
So to explain how they came about, that's what the economics should be doing, and it's

03:21.520 --> 03:23.280
not.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.240
So this is the greatest thing that the earth has ever created is what you're saying in

03:26.240 --> 03:27.240
this conversation?

03:27.240 --> 03:31.000
Yeah, we're the most elaborate construction on the planet.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.640
And that's not what we've done, we've denigrated the planet itself.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.560
We don't have respect for the fact that life itself is an incredible creation.

03:39.560 --> 03:45.000
If I had to see how humanity is going to survive what we're putting ourselves through, then

03:45.000 --> 03:50.320
we'd have to come out of it as a species which sees its role as preserving and respecting

03:50.320 --> 03:51.320
life.

03:51.320 --> 04:00.800
I like how you took my silly, incredible statement and made it into a serious one about how amazing

04:00.800 --> 04:01.960
life is.

04:01.960 --> 04:07.400
Life is incredible, and we humans don't respect it enough, we trash it.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.460
And that's what economics, I think, has played a huge role in that.

04:10.460 --> 04:15.360
So I actually regard my discipline, I would never call it a profession, let alone a science.

04:15.360 --> 04:22.740
My discipline has probably helped bring about the termination potential, the feasible termination

04:22.740 --> 04:24.160
of human civilization.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
Strong words.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.000
Okay, let's return to the basics of economics.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.160
So what is the soul and the practice of economics?

04:33.160 --> 04:34.560
What should be the goal of it?

04:34.560 --> 04:41.480
Because you're speaking very poetically, but we'll also speak pragmatically about the tools

04:41.480 --> 04:47.240
of economics, the variables of economics, the metrics, the goals, the models.

04:47.240 --> 04:50.200
Practically speaking, what are the goals of economics?

04:50.200 --> 04:55.880
Well, in terms of the tools we use, we should be using the tools that engineers use, frankly.

04:55.880 --> 05:00.960
And that sounds ridiculously simple, because you would expect that economists are using

05:01.200 --> 05:06.800
up-to-date techniques that are common in other sciences where you're dealing with similar

05:06.800 --> 05:11.880
ideas of stocks and flows and interactions between the environment and a system and so

05:11.880 --> 05:12.880
on.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.080
And that's fundamentally systems engineering.

05:15.080 --> 05:18.080
And that's what we should be using as the tools of economics.

05:18.080 --> 05:22.440
Now if you look at what economists actually do, the sophisticated stuff involves difference

05:22.440 --> 05:25.160
equations.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.160
And like difference equations, you know, if you've done enough mathematics as you have,

05:29.240 --> 05:33.720
no difference equations are useful for like individual level processes.

05:33.720 --> 05:38.600
If you're talking about autonomous, it'll go from state t to t plus 1, t plus 2 and

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
so on.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.720
But not when you're talking at the aggregate level, there you use differential equations

05:42.720 --> 05:44.680
to measure it all.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.560
Economists have been using difference equations.

05:46.560 --> 05:51.160
So there's like a book, I think it's by Sargent and one other, called Advanced Methods in

05:51.160 --> 05:54.720
Economics Using Python, two volume set.

05:54.760 --> 06:00.760
It's about close to 2,000 pages and four of those pages are on differential equations.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.080
The rest is all difference equations.

06:03.080 --> 06:05.920
So they're using entirely the wrong mathematics to start with.

06:05.920 --> 06:10.000
For people listening, what is difference equations versus differential equations?

06:10.000 --> 06:13.400
Difference equation is like you can do in a spreadsheet.

06:13.400 --> 06:18.360
This is the value for 1991, 92, 93, 94.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.840
So you have discrete jumps in time.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.120
A differential equation says there's a process moving through time and you will have a rate

06:27.120 --> 06:33.800
of change of variable is a function of the state of itself and other variables and rates

06:33.800 --> 06:35.760
of change of those variables.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.400
And that is what you use when you're doing an aggregate model.

06:38.400 --> 06:43.320
So if you're modeling water, for example, or fluid dynamics, you have a set of differential

06:43.320 --> 06:47.480
equations describing the entire body of fluid moving through time.

06:47.480 --> 06:52.440
You don't try to model the discrete motion of each molecule of H2O.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.320
So at the aggregate level, you use differential equations for processes that occur through

06:56.320 --> 06:58.600
time and that's economics.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.920
It occurs through time.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.360
You should be using that particular technology.

07:02.360 --> 07:07.800
But some economists do learn differential equations, but they don't learn stability analysis.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.240
So they simply assume equilibrium is stable and they work in equilibrium terms all the

07:12.240 --> 07:13.240
time.

07:13.240 --> 07:22.400
So the technical level, it's an incredibly complicated way of modeling the world using

07:22.400 --> 07:23.880
entirely the wrong tools.

07:23.880 --> 07:29.640
Okay, we'll talk about that because it's unclear what the right tools are.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.360
Maybe it's more clear to you, but...

07:31.360 --> 07:33.560
I've got to make it clear to an audience.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.680
Well, so this is a very complicated world.

07:36.680 --> 07:37.880
It's a complex world.

07:38.880 --> 07:49.560
Some of the most complex systems on Earth are the human mind, the economy, and the biosphere.

07:49.560 --> 07:53.880
So we'll go to that place.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.400
I'm fascinated by complex systems.

07:56.400 --> 08:03.040
I'm humbled by them, even at their simplest level of cellular automata.

08:03.040 --> 08:10.240
I'm not sure what the right tools are to understand that, especially when part of

08:10.240 --> 08:13.840
the complex system is like a hierarchy of other complex systems.

08:13.840 --> 08:20.040
You said the economy is a fascinating complex system, but it's made up of human minds.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.880
And those are interesting.

08:21.880 --> 08:26.640
Those are interesting, perhaps impossible to model, but we can try and we can try to

08:26.640 --> 08:30.080
figure out how to approximate them and maybe that's the challenge of economics.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.120
Okay, we'll keep returning to the basics.

08:33.120 --> 08:36.360
Let us try to learn something from history.

08:36.360 --> 08:42.560
I also see as part of economics is us trying to figure out stuff, and there's a few smart

08:42.560 --> 08:49.240
folks that write books throughout human history, and sometimes they name schools of economics

08:49.240 --> 08:50.640
after them.

08:50.640 --> 08:56.160
So let us take a stroll through history.

08:56.240 --> 09:02.480
Can you describe at a high level what are the different schools of economics, perhaps

09:02.480 --> 09:09.080
ones that are interesting to you, perhaps ones that the difference between which reveals

09:09.080 --> 09:14.040
something useful or insightful for our conversation.

09:14.040 --> 09:22.680
So you know, you could neoclassical, post-Kensian, Austrian, I like the biophysical economics

09:22.680 --> 09:26.520
and so on, other heterodox economic schools that you find interesting.

09:26.520 --> 09:32.040
Okay, I actually find interesting a school which went extinct about 250 years ago.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.680
That's where I'd like to start from, and they're called the Physicocrats.

09:35.680 --> 09:41.040
And the name itself implies where their knowledge came from, because if you go back far enough

09:41.040 --> 09:46.760
in history, we didn't do autopsies, but when you started doing autopsies, they found wires,

09:46.760 --> 09:51.440
they found tubes, et cetera, et cetera, and they started seeing the body as a circulation

09:51.480 --> 09:55.280
system, and they applied the same sort of logic to the economy.

09:55.280 --> 10:00.880
And they came out of an agricultural economy, which was France, and they saw that the wealth

10:00.880 --> 10:03.120
came effectively from the sun.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.960
So they saw all wealth comes from, they said the soil, but what they really mean is the

10:06.960 --> 10:09.160
soil absorbs the energy of the sun.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.080
One seed plants, a thousand flea seeds come back.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.880
There is no surplus.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.560
We are simply mining what we can find out of the natural economy.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.800
That's where we should have stayed and developed from that forward.

10:20.800 --> 10:24.880
We then went through the classical school of economics, which comes out of Adam Smith.

10:24.880 --> 10:31.680
And Smith, coming from Scotland, looked at what the Physicocrats said, and what the Physicocrats

10:31.680 --> 10:35.880
argued was that agriculture is the source of all wealth, and the manufacturing sector

10:35.880 --> 10:37.200
is sterile.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.760
That's literally the term they used to describe the manufacturing sector.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.000
What does sterile mean?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.880
Sterile means you don't extract value.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.080
You simply change the shape of value.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.080
So the value comes from the soil.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.000
The value comes from the soil.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.520
That's the free gift of nature.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.420
That's literally the phrase they used.

10:54.420 --> 10:59.320
And we then distribute the free gift of nature around, and we need carriages, which was the

10:59.320 --> 11:04.360
manufacturing term they used at the time, as well as wheat.

11:04.360 --> 11:09.400
So to make the carriages, we take what's been taken from the soil, and we convert it to

11:09.400 --> 11:10.400
a different form.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.040
But there is no value added in manufacturing.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.600
So Smith looked at that and said, well, I'm from Scotland.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.120
Easy now.

11:18.120 --> 11:21.640
We've got these industries, you know, and we make stuff and it's machinery.

11:21.640 --> 11:26.320
And he said, no, it's not land that gives us the source of value, it's labor.

11:26.320 --> 11:33.080
Now that led to the classical school of thought, and that said that all value comes from labor,

11:33.080 --> 11:38.840
that value is objective, so it's the amount of effort you put in, that the price two things

11:38.840 --> 11:42.920
will exchange for reflects the relative effort that's involved in the manufacturing.

11:42.920 --> 11:47.120
So this computer takes two hours to make, and this bottle takes two minutes to make,

11:47.120 --> 11:50.520
then this is worth 60 times as much as that.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.560
They didn't talk about marginal cost, it was absolute cost effectively.

11:55.560 --> 12:01.920
They didn't talk about utility as a subjective thing, they ridiculed subjective utility theory.

12:01.920 --> 12:07.400
That led to Marx, and Marx is probably the most brilliant mind in the history of economics.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.160
The only other competitor I'd see is Schumpeter, possibly Keynes, but in my terms of ranking

12:12.160 --> 12:18.680
of intellects, Marx, Schumpeter, Keynes in terms of the outstanding capacities to think.

12:18.680 --> 12:24.800
But Marx then turned that classical school, which was pro-capitalism and anti-feudal,

12:24.800 --> 12:29.360
into a critique of capitalism, which led to the neoclassical school coming along as a

12:29.360 --> 12:31.320
defense of capitalism.

12:31.320 --> 12:36.520
But they defended it using the ideas of the subjective theory of value, so that value

12:36.520 --> 12:42.560
does not reflect effort, it's the satisfaction individuals get from different objects that

12:42.560 --> 12:45.760
determines their value, marginal utility.

12:45.760 --> 12:50.000
It's the marginal cost that determines how much they sell for.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.280
Capitalism equilibrates marginal cost and marginal utility, and the concepts of equilibrium

12:56.280 --> 13:00.600
and marginal this and marginal that became the neoclassical school, and that's still

13:00.600 --> 13:03.660
the dominant school now 150 years later.

13:03.660 --> 13:07.100
So that's the one that everybody learns, and when you first learn economics, if you

13:07.100 --> 13:10.860
don't have the critical background that I managed to acquire, that's what you think

13:10.860 --> 13:18.100
is economics, the marginal utility, equilibrium-oriented analysis of mainstream economics.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.540
And for example, they ignore money.

13:20.540 --> 13:23.580
People think, economists, you must be an expert on money because you're an economist.

13:23.580 --> 13:27.660
Well, in fact, economists learn literally in the first few weeks at university that

13:27.660 --> 13:29.480
money is irrelevant.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.900
They say money illusion.

13:31.940 --> 13:37.220
They represent people's tastes using what they call indifference curves, and they're

13:37.220 --> 13:39.220
like isoquants on a weather map.

13:39.220 --> 13:43.020
If you look at an isoquant, it shows you all the points of the same pressure.

13:43.020 --> 13:47.540
So you can be here or you can be in Denver, and the air pressure can be the same if you're

13:47.540 --> 13:50.620
in the same weather unit, so you just draw a cell that links together.

13:50.620 --> 13:55.100
Well, they do the same thing with utility and say lots of bananas and very few coconuts

13:55.100 --> 14:00.820
can give you the same utility as lots of coconuts and very few bananas, and you draw basically

14:01.140 --> 14:06.140
like a hyperbola running down and linking the two, and they'll say, well, that's your

14:06.140 --> 14:07.140
utility.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.420
That describes your tastes.

14:08.420 --> 14:14.300
And then we have your income, and given your income, you can buy that many bananas completely

14:14.300 --> 14:17.740
or that many coconuts or a straight-line combination of the two.

14:17.740 --> 14:23.500
And then if we double the nominal price of coconuts and double the nominal price of bananas

14:23.500 --> 14:25.500
and double your income, what happens?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.900
And the correct answer is, oh, nothing, sir.

14:27.900 --> 14:34.100
You stay at the same point of tangency between what your budget is and which particular utility

14:34.100 --> 14:36.940
curve gives you the maximum satisfaction.

14:36.940 --> 14:40.060
So that gets ingrained into them, and they think anybody who worries about money suffers

14:40.060 --> 14:42.420
from money illusion.

14:42.420 --> 14:48.100
You are therefore ignorant of the deep insights of economics if you think money actually matters.

14:48.100 --> 14:53.860
So you have an entire theory of economics which presumes we exchange through data.

14:53.860 --> 14:58.260
Like I'll swap you that Microsoft Surface for, actually, I'll take two of those for

14:58.260 --> 14:59.260
one of these.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.020
We do this bartering type arrangement.

15:02.020 --> 15:07.780
In fact, that only works if money plays no creative role in the economy.

15:07.780 --> 15:12.540
And that's where you'll find, reading Schumpeter, the insight that's the school of thought that

15:12.540 --> 15:15.220
I come from that says money is essential.

15:15.220 --> 15:19.100
Money actually adds to demand, and we'll talk about that later on.

15:19.140 --> 15:28.460
So that's the neoclassical school that ends up being subjective theory of value, non-monetary,

15:28.460 --> 15:33.580
as though everything happens in barter, and focusing on equilibrium, as though everything

15:33.580 --> 15:39.260
happens in equilibrium, or if you get disturbed from equilibrium, you return back to it again.

15:39.260 --> 15:45.140
And that mindset describes capitalism, its most interesting feature is that it reaches

15:45.140 --> 15:46.140
equilibrium.

15:46.220 --> 15:48.620
What planet are we on to believe that?

15:48.620 --> 15:54.060
Because if you look at the real world, the real exciting world of capitalism in which

15:54.060 --> 15:59.380
we live, change is by far the most obvious characteristic of it.

15:59.380 --> 16:00.380
There's no equilibrium.

16:00.380 --> 16:01.380
There's no equilibrium.

16:01.380 --> 16:02.380
It's unstable.

16:02.380 --> 16:05.900
And as a mathematician, it's easy.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.780
You work with stability analysis.

16:07.780 --> 16:10.580
You work out what the Jacobian is.

16:10.580 --> 16:14.220
You work out the Lyapunov exponents in a complex system.

16:14.220 --> 16:19.140
We're used to the idea that equilibrium is unstable, but economists get schooled in believing

16:19.140 --> 16:23.340
that everything happens in equilibrium, and they don't learn stability analysis.

16:23.340 --> 16:25.180
So all that stuff is missing.

16:25.180 --> 16:32.300
So onto the schools of thought, treating the economy as an equilibrium system, which was

16:32.300 --> 16:36.740
what the neoclassical school did, is what Keynes disturbed.

16:36.740 --> 16:41.620
And he really disturbed it by talking about, fundamentally, that uncertainty determines

16:41.620 --> 16:43.580
our decisions about the future.

16:43.580 --> 16:48.820
So when we consume, you know if you like Weiser or whatever particular drink we want

16:48.820 --> 16:51.900
to have, you know the current situation.

16:51.900 --> 16:55.100
But to invest, you must be making guesses about the future.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.660
But you don't know the future.

16:56.660 --> 16:57.700
So what do you do?

16:57.700 --> 17:00.420
You extrapolate what you currently know.

17:00.420 --> 17:05.380
And as you said, this is a terrible basis on which to plan for the future.

17:05.380 --> 17:10.740
But this is the only thing you can do where there is no possibility of solid calculation.

17:10.740 --> 17:13.980
So investment is therefore subject to uncertainty.

17:13.980 --> 17:17.580
And therefore, you will get volatility out of investment.

17:17.580 --> 17:22.760
You will get fads, of course, booms and slumps coming out of that because people extrapolate

17:22.760 --> 17:24.600
for the current conditions.

17:24.600 --> 17:27.340
And that's the normal state of a capitalist economy.

17:27.340 --> 17:30.900
And Schumpeter argued that that's what gives us this creativity as well.

17:30.900 --> 17:36.340
The fact that you can perceive a potential demand, but you don't, first of all, you don't

17:36.340 --> 17:38.100
know whether that demand is going to work.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.100
Secondly, you don't know who your competitor is going to be, whether somebody is going

17:41.100 --> 17:42.780
to be ahead of you or behind.

17:42.780 --> 17:46.700
If there's a fad, you'll over-invest, okay?

17:46.700 --> 17:48.980
All this stuff is the real nature of capitalism.

17:48.980 --> 17:54.980
And that's what we're trying to capture, the dynamic, non-equilibrium, monetary violence

17:54.980 --> 17:57.100
and creativity of capitalism.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.820
That's what we should be analyzing.

17:58.820 --> 18:02.980
And the post-Keynesian school has gone in that orientation.

18:03.220 --> 18:09.300
They've been, in my opinion, inhibited by learning their mathematics from neoclassical

18:09.300 --> 18:12.860
economists, so they don't have enough of the technology of complex systems.

18:12.860 --> 18:18.100
There's only a really tiny handful of people working in complex systems analysis in post-Keynesian

18:18.100 --> 18:21.060
economics, but that is, to me, the most interesting area.

18:21.060 --> 18:26.100
So their tools may be lacking, but they fundamentally accept the instability of things.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.100
That's right.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.100
That's right.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.100
And so that's what makes them interesting.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.420
So let me try to summarize what you said, and then you say how stupid I am.

18:32.420 --> 18:33.420
Okay.

18:33.420 --> 18:40.900
So then there was the physiocrats that thought value came from the land.

18:40.900 --> 18:50.420
Then there's Adam Smith, who said, nah, value comes from human labor.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.620
That was the classical school.

18:52.620 --> 18:59.740
And then neoclassical is value comes from bananas and coconuts.

18:59.740 --> 19:06.260
Human preference is like human happiness, how happy a banana makes you.

19:06.260 --> 19:13.460
And then the Keynesian and the post-Keynesian were like, yeah, well, you can't, you can

19:13.460 --> 19:19.020
never, the moment you try to put value to a banana and a coconut, you're already working

19:19.020 --> 19:20.260
in the past.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.260
Yeah.

19:21.260 --> 19:28.140
It's always going to be chaos and stability, and then you're fishing in uncertain waters,

19:28.300 --> 19:32.780
and we have to embrace that and come up with tools that model that well.

19:32.780 --> 19:36.860
And also Joseph Schompeter, what school would you put him under?

19:36.860 --> 19:41.020
Is he a Kansanian or is he Austrian economics?

19:41.020 --> 19:45.420
He's an Austrian, and Austrians deny, that's the intriguing.

19:45.420 --> 19:51.060
He's from Austria, but he's not an Austrian economist.

19:51.060 --> 19:54.220
There are elements of the Austrian school of thought, which are worthwhile.

19:54.220 --> 19:59.060
What is Austrian economics in this beautiful whirlwind picture that you painted?

19:59.060 --> 20:00.060
Okay.

20:00.060 --> 20:04.260
Austrian economics grew out of the rebellion against the classical school.

20:04.260 --> 20:09.420
So you had three intellects who mainly led the growth of the neoclassical school back

20:09.420 --> 20:10.420
in the 1870s.

20:10.420 --> 20:17.620
It was William Jevons from England, Menger, who's from Austria, and Vollrass from France.

20:18.020 --> 20:26.260
Vollrass tried to work out a set of equations to describe a multi-product economy where

20:26.260 --> 20:29.300
there's numerous producers and numerous consumers.

20:29.300 --> 20:33.940
Everybody's both a producer and a consumer, and you try to work out a vector of prices

20:33.940 --> 20:37.460
that will give you equilibrium in all markets instantaneously.

20:37.460 --> 20:40.180
And that's his equilibrium orientation.

20:40.180 --> 20:43.780
Jevons is also on about equilibrium, but he worked more at the aggregate level.

20:44.020 --> 20:49.100
So this is a supply curve and a demand curve, and that's what Marshall ultimately codified.

20:49.100 --> 20:52.580
Menger was pretty much saying that, well, yes, there might be an equilibrium, but you're

20:52.580 --> 20:54.460
going to get disturbed from it all the time.

20:54.460 --> 20:55.940
You'll be above or below the equilibrium.

20:55.940 --> 21:00.500
And what came out of the Austrian school was an acceptance of that sort of vision that

21:00.500 --> 21:04.340
a market should reach equilibrium, but then said, well, you'll get disturbed away from

21:04.340 --> 21:05.680
the equilibrium.

21:05.680 --> 21:10.900
And that's what gives you the vitality of capitalism, because an entrepreneur will see

21:10.900 --> 21:16.100
an arbitrage advantage and try to close that gap, and that will give you innovation over time.

21:16.100 --> 21:21.140
And Schumpeter went beyond that and saw the role of money and said that an entrepreneur

21:21.140 --> 21:22.740
is somebody with a great idea and no money.

21:24.900 --> 21:30.020
So to become a capitalist, you've got to get money, and therefore you've got to approach

21:30.020 --> 21:35.300
the finance sector to get the money, and the finance sector creates money and also creates

21:35.300 --> 21:36.500
a debt for the entrepreneur.

21:37.220 --> 21:42.820
And so you get this financial engine turning up as well, and you will get movements away

21:42.820 --> 21:44.580
from equilibrium out of that.

21:44.580 --> 21:47.220
You won't necessarily head back towards the equilibrium.

21:47.220 --> 21:54.100
So Schumpeter has a rich vision of capitalism in which money plays an essential role, in

21:54.100 --> 21:57.940
which you will be disturbed from equilibrium all the time.

21:58.820 --> 22:04.260
And that is really, I think, a much closer vision of actual capitalism than anything

22:04.260 --> 22:13.780
by even the leading Austrians, Hayek, et cetera, et cetera, and certainly Rombardo, I find

22:13.780 --> 22:19.700
totally like reading a cardboard cutout version of the wealth of nations.

22:20.660 --> 22:22.020
I find his worth trivial.

22:23.380 --> 22:27.700
But Schumpeter was rich, but with the same foundations as the Austrians.

22:27.700 --> 22:31.460
But because he talked about the importance of money that took him away from the Austrian

22:31.460 --> 22:36.420
vision, which is very much based on a hard money idea of capitalism, Schumpeter said

22:36.420 --> 22:41.700
you needed the capacity of the financial sector to create money to empower entrepreneurs.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.580
And that's a very important vision.

22:44.580 --> 22:48.420
So Schumpeter's argument is the deviation from equilibrium, that's where all the fun

22:48.420 --> 22:50.020
happens, that's where all the magic happens.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.620
That's the magic of capitalism.

22:51.620 --> 22:55.060
And like the Austrians, because they focus on the deviation from equilibrium, they're

22:55.060 --> 22:56.660
better than neoclassicals.

22:56.660 --> 23:00.420
But they still have this belief in the, you know, if you'll reach equilibrium ultimately,

23:00.420 --> 23:07.140
or you'll head back towards it, whereas they don't have an explanation of capitalism

23:07.140 --> 23:09.860
that gives you cycles apart from having the wrong rate of interest.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.620
So there's no role for an accumulation of debt over time.

23:13.620 --> 23:19.940
So what Schumpeter gave us was a vision of the creativity of capitalism being driven

23:19.940 --> 23:23.860
by entrepreneurs who are funded by money creation by the finance sector.

23:24.900 --> 23:27.700
And that's fundamentally the world in which we live.

23:28.660 --> 23:36.420
So there's also, kids these days are all into modern monetary theory, what's that about?

23:36.420 --> 23:37.140
Okay.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.820
Modern monetary theory is accounting.

23:39.700 --> 23:41.940
I want to summarize it bluntly.

23:41.940 --> 23:46.500
It's simply saying, let's do the accounting, because what money is, is a creature of double

23:46.500 --> 23:48.100
entry bookkeeping, okay?

23:48.100 --> 23:49.540
What's double entry bookkeeping?

23:49.540 --> 23:52.580
Banks, this was invented back in the 1500s in Italy.

23:53.220 --> 23:57.620
I've forgotten the particular merchant who did it, based on some Arabic ideas as well.

23:58.100 --> 24:04.900
The thing is, if you want to keep track of your financial flows, then you divide what you,

24:06.180 --> 24:10.180
all the financial claims on you, you divide into claims you have on somebody else,

24:10.180 --> 24:14.340
which are your assets, claims somebody else has on you, which are your liabilities,

24:14.340 --> 24:16.980
and the gap between the two is your equity.

24:16.980 --> 24:20.660
So you record every transaction twice on one row, okay?

24:20.660 --> 24:26.340
So for example, if you and I do a financial transfer, you have a bank account, I have

24:26.340 --> 24:30.740
a bank account, your bank account will go down, mine goes up, okay?

24:30.740 --> 24:34.660
And the sum of the operation is zero, okay?

24:34.660 --> 24:38.180
But on the other hand, if I go to a bank and borrow money, then my account goes up,

24:38.180 --> 24:42.180
they put money in my deposit account, the bank's assets go up, okay?

24:42.180 --> 24:46.820
And still the same sum applies, assets minus liabilities minus equity equals zero.

24:46.820 --> 24:51.700
Now, that's simply saying money is an accounting, a creature of accounting,

24:51.700 --> 24:53.700
it's not a creature of a commodity.

24:53.700 --> 24:57.860
So if you think about how Austrians think about money and how gold bugs think about

24:57.860 --> 25:01.540
money and Bitcoin enthusiasts, if there are any left, think about money,

25:02.260 --> 25:05.140
what they see is money is an object, okay?

25:05.140 --> 25:11.780
And you and I can both have more gold if we're both willing to go to this mine somewhere

25:11.780 --> 25:14.660
and dig a few holes and get a few specks of gold out.

25:14.660 --> 25:20.100
So there's no competition or no interaction between you and me if money is gold.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.820
And I think money should be an object, a commodity.

25:22.820 --> 25:26.980
But money fundamentally is not a commodity, it's a claim on somebody else.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.300
That's money as its essence.

25:29.300 --> 25:32.340
So when you do it, you must use double entry bookkeeping to do it.

25:32.340 --> 25:35.140
And then when you do, you find all the answers that come out of thinking

25:35.140 --> 25:36.500
as money is a commodity, you're wrong.

25:37.140 --> 25:40.660
So for example, and I've got Elon on this one, so I want to get this with Elon,

25:40.660 --> 25:44.100
because I saw him making a comment about this a few weeks ago on Twitter.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.700
He said that it's wrong for the government.

25:45.700 --> 25:50.020
Effectively, it seems wrong for the government to always be in deficit, okay?

25:50.020 --> 25:53.060
Now, when you look at it and say, well, how is money created?

25:54.180 --> 25:58.580
How does money come about when it's not a commodity like gold,

25:58.580 --> 26:01.860
when you dig up out of the ground, when it's actually social relations

26:01.860 --> 26:03.380
between people that create money?

26:03.940 --> 26:09.940
Well, money is fundamentally the liabilities of the banking sector.

26:11.220 --> 26:15.860
If we make a transfer between us, your deposit account goes down,

26:15.860 --> 26:17.380
my deposit account goes up.

26:18.180 --> 26:22.740
Those are exchanges on the liability side of the banking sector.

26:23.300 --> 26:27.380
But if we have a transaction with the bank, then if the bank lends us money,

26:27.380 --> 26:31.860
its assets loans go up, its deposits go up, again, that same balance.

26:31.860 --> 26:35.220
So you've got to look and say money therefore is fundamentally

26:35.220 --> 26:37.460
the liabilities of the banking sector.

26:37.460 --> 26:40.180
So how do you create additional liabilities?

26:40.180 --> 26:43.940
You must have an operation which occurs both on the liability side

26:43.940 --> 26:46.660
and the asset side of the banking sector.

26:46.660 --> 26:49.860
So if you and I make a new transaction, no money is created.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.220
Existing money is redistributed.

26:53.220 --> 26:56.260
But if you go to a bank and take out a bank loan,

26:56.260 --> 26:58.420
then money is created by the bank loan.

26:58.420 --> 27:01.460
So the liabilities of the banking sector rise, the assets rise,

27:01.460 --> 27:05.780
they're balanced, but the banking sector means more money, okay?

27:05.780 --> 27:08.740
So that's how private banks create money.

27:08.740 --> 27:14.020
And that's what I first started working on when I became an academic about 35 years ago.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.060
The actual dynamics of private money creation.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.300
But the government has the same sort of story.

27:19.300 --> 27:24.660
If the government runs a deficit, it spends more money on the individuals

27:25.300 --> 27:31.140
in the economy than it taxes them, which means their bank accounts increase.

27:31.140 --> 27:36.580
So a government deficit creates money for the private sector, okay?

27:36.580 --> 27:39.060
So that's where money creation occurs from the government.

27:39.060 --> 27:45.140
So it puts more money into people's bank accounts by spending,

27:45.140 --> 27:48.260
by welfare payments than it takes out by taxation.

27:48.820 --> 27:50.660
So that's creating new money.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.180
And then on the other side on the bank,

27:53.060 --> 27:56.100
the money turns up in the reserve accounts of the banks,

27:56.100 --> 27:59.300
which are basically the private bank's bank accounts at the central bank.

28:00.260 --> 28:05.780
So rather than the asset of private money creation being loans,

28:05.780 --> 28:08.100
the asset of government money creation is reserves.

28:09.460 --> 28:10.980
Okay.

28:10.980 --> 28:11.620
Right.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.140
Money creation.

28:13.140 --> 28:13.860
Money creation.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.140
Is a good thing.

28:15.140 --> 28:19.540
So you mentioned a bunch of stuff like private money creation with the liabilities in the banks,

28:19.540 --> 28:22.980
and then how the government is doing, the reserves, blah, blah, blah.

28:23.860 --> 28:27.060
At the end of the day, there's a bunch of printers that are printing money.

28:28.900 --> 28:30.340
And then you also said something interesting,

28:30.340 --> 28:34.660
which is social relations between humans is what creates money.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.900
I think my mind has blown several times over the past minute.

28:40.180 --> 28:44.420
So it's difficult for me to reconstruct the pieces of my mind back together.

28:44.420 --> 28:50.580
But basic question, is money creation a good thing or a bad thing?

28:50.580 --> 28:56.420
Money creation is a good thing because money creation is what allows commerce to happen.

28:56.420 --> 28:58.420
Isn't there a conservation of-

28:58.420 --> 28:59.140
No, there isn't.

28:59.140 --> 29:02.980
I had had arguments with physicists over this and it took me a long time to answer it.

29:02.980 --> 29:05.140
They thought the sum total of all money is zero.

29:06.740 --> 29:10.420
It's the sum total of all assets and liabilities is zero.

29:10.420 --> 29:15.780
So if you imagine your assets minus your liabilities is your equity,

29:16.420 --> 29:21.380
and your asset is somebody else's liability, and your liability is somebody else's asset.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.300
When we're talking about financial assets,

29:23.300 --> 29:27.060
and this is another mind blowing thing that I've just recently solved myself.

29:27.620 --> 29:31.540
So the sum total of all financial assets and liabilities is zero.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.820
Okay. Wait, wait, wait. I'm going to interrupt you rudely.

29:35.700 --> 29:38.020
What are assets? What are liabilities?

29:38.020 --> 29:39.700
Assets are your claims on somebody else.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.420
Specific. Give me an example of an asset.

29:44.420 --> 29:46.580
Okay. Do you have a mortgage for this house?

29:46.580 --> 29:47.940
No. I'm renting.

29:47.940 --> 29:48.820
You're renting. There you go.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.860
Well, if you had a mortgage, that'd be your liability.

29:51.860 --> 29:52.740
That would be my liability.

29:52.740 --> 29:54.980
Okay. The mortgage with the bank's asset.

29:55.940 --> 29:56.260
Right.

29:56.260 --> 29:58.340
Okay. If you add the two together, you get zero.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.860
Okay. So that's zero.

29:59.860 --> 30:00.500
That's zero.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.620
The money is the liability side of the banking sector.

30:04.740 --> 30:05.060
Okay.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.420
Okay. Assets are the...

30:08.260 --> 30:11.700
The assets on the other side can be either created by the banking sector,

30:11.700 --> 30:16.340
which is where you get bank loans, or created by the government where you get reserves.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.500
But money is the liabilities. Money is...

30:18.500 --> 30:23.540
If you think about protons and antiprotons in that sense, money is like the antiproton.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.460
It's the negative, the liability.

30:25.700 --> 30:31.060
Wait, wait, wait. The liability is the negative.

30:31.060 --> 30:31.380
Yeah.

30:31.380 --> 30:33.540
How's that money? I thought money is the positive.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.980
What is a liability for the banking sector is an asset for you and me.

30:37.620 --> 30:40.180
An asset includes money.

30:40.180 --> 30:40.820
Yeah. Yeah.

30:40.820 --> 30:41.060
Okay.

30:42.580 --> 30:45.460
You'd have a bank account and you'd have some cash.

30:45.460 --> 30:46.020
Yeah.

30:46.020 --> 30:51.380
Okay. Those are your assets. But the bank account is a liability to the banking sector,

30:51.940 --> 30:54.740
and the cash is a liability to the Federal Reserve.

30:54.740 --> 30:56.820
Okay. So what's money?

30:56.820 --> 31:04.020
Well, money is the promise of a third party that we both accept to close our transaction.

31:04.020 --> 31:04.500
And this is...

31:04.500 --> 31:05.460
And that's a bank?

31:05.460 --> 31:11.140
That's a bank. One of the most important works I've ever read is a work by a wonderful,

31:11.140 --> 31:17.140
now unfortunately deceased, tiny Italian economist called Augusto Graziani.

31:17.780 --> 31:23.220
And he's the most wonderful personality. Augusto, I've met him on a few occasions,

31:23.780 --> 31:27.780
is one of the few human beings who can speak in perfectly formed paragraphs.

31:28.580 --> 31:34.740
Okay. Superbly eloquent. And what he did was write a paper called The Monetary Theory of Production.

31:35.860 --> 31:40.580
You can find it downloaded on the web. It's pretty much open source now.

31:41.380 --> 31:45.140
And what he said is, what distinguishes a monetary economy from a barter economy?

31:45.780 --> 31:49.220
So he said, in a barter economy, what we do is, you know,

31:49.220 --> 31:51.540
I'll give you two of these for one of those.

31:51.540 --> 31:52.020
Yeah.

31:52.020 --> 31:56.260
Okay, barter. Just working at a relative price, there are two of us involved and there are two

31:56.260 --> 32:03.780
commodities. So with money, money is a triangular transaction, okay? There is one commodity,

32:03.780 --> 32:10.180
I want to buy that can of drink off you, two people, and the price that's worked out

32:10.180 --> 32:16.500
ends up being in a transfer from the promises to pay the bank that the buyer has to the promises

32:16.580 --> 32:24.340
pay the bank that the seller has. So what you have is a monetary transaction in a capitalist economy

32:24.340 --> 32:27.780
involves three agents, the buyer, the seller, and the bank.

32:28.340 --> 32:29.860
So the bank also has to be part of it.

32:29.860 --> 32:34.660
Well, the bank has to be part of it. When I hand you the money, you accept that as

32:35.940 --> 32:39.140
you've now got, rather than it's the bank promising to pay me something,

32:39.140 --> 32:43.300
it's now the bank promising to pay you something. And we exchange the promises of banks,

32:43.300 --> 32:44.500
and that's fundamentally money.

32:45.460 --> 32:52.980
So money is fundamentally a threesome and everybody gets fucked. Is that a good way to put it? No.

32:52.980 --> 32:54.020
At least, I'm just kidding.

32:54.980 --> 32:57.460
Oh, now I can use French in this conversation. That's good.

32:57.460 --> 33:02.020
That's not French. That's a different language. I'll explain it to you one day.

33:03.060 --> 33:08.820
You Australians will never understand. Okay. If I can return, we'll jump around if it's okay.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.860
Oh, that's fine.

33:10.100 --> 33:18.420
So you mentioned Karl Marx as one of the great intellects, economic thinkers ever.

33:19.620 --> 33:23.780
He might be number one. You study him quite a bit. You disagree with him quite a bit,

33:23.780 --> 33:28.820
but you still think he's a powerful thinker. A powerful mind.

33:29.380 --> 33:32.660
A powerful mind. So first of all, let's just explore the human.

33:33.540 --> 33:40.980
Why do you say so? What's interesting in that mind? In the way he saw the world,

33:40.980 --> 33:44.420
what are the insights that you find brilliant?

33:45.060 --> 33:51.780
Marx once described his major work as towards a critical examination of everything existing.

33:54.020 --> 33:58.900
So he's a modest bastard. So he wanted to understand and criticize everything.

33:59.540 --> 34:07.780
And he wasn't trained directly by Hegel, but his teachers were Hegelian philosophers.

34:07.780 --> 34:14.180
And what Hegel developed was a concept called dialectics. And dialectics is a philosophy of

34:14.180 --> 34:21.140
change. And when most people hear the word dialectics, they come up with this unpronounceable

34:21.140 --> 34:27.780
trio of words called thesis, antithesis, synthesis. I can barely get the words out myself.

34:27.780 --> 34:31.540
And that actually is not Hegel at all. That's another German philosopher called Fichte.

34:31.540 --> 34:33.060
Oh, I thought it was Kant.

34:33.060 --> 34:34.820
No, Fichte. Well, I'm not sure.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.660
I'm mixing them up. All Germans look the same to me.

34:39.860 --> 34:42.500
But if you look at this beautiful book called Marx and Contradiction,

34:42.500 --> 34:47.620
you want to find a great explanation for Marx's philosophy. I think it's Wild,

34:47.620 --> 34:54.180
W-I-L-D-E, Marx and Contradiction. And he points out the actual origins of Marx's philosophy.

34:54.260 --> 34:58.180
I didn't know that when I first read Marx. So I became exposed to Marx

34:58.740 --> 35:04.420
when I was a student at Sydney University. And we'd had a strike at the university over

35:04.420 --> 35:10.260
the teaching of philosophy. And what happened was the philosophy department had a lot of radical

35:10.260 --> 35:16.420
philosophers in it and a conservative chief philosopher. And the radicals wanted to have

35:16.420 --> 35:20.980
a course on what they called feminist aspects of philosophical, sorry, philosophical aspects of

35:20.980 --> 35:25.860
feminist thought. And the staff voted in favor of it. This is back in the days when university

35:25.860 --> 35:31.060
departments were democratic. The professor opposed it. He got it blocked at a high level. The staff

35:31.060 --> 35:35.460
leapfrogged over that. And then finally the vice chancellor blocked it. So that led to a strike

35:36.260 --> 35:39.940
over the teaching of philosophy at Sydney University, which at one stage,

35:41.060 --> 35:45.700
over half the students were on strike. Okay. Economics began out of that.

35:45.700 --> 35:48.420
Over teaching of a philosophy of feminism.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.220
Yes.

35:49.220 --> 35:49.940
God, it's good to be a student.

35:49.940 --> 35:55.380
That's such a different life to what we're living now. That's the academic milieu in which I

35:56.020 --> 36:00.900
developed all my ideas. And I had become a critic. I've gone from being a believer of

36:00.900 --> 36:06.100
mainstream economics when I was a first year student to disbelieving at halfway through first

36:06.100 --> 36:11.460
year. Okay. And I then spent a long time trying to change it, getting nowhere. And then this

36:11.460 --> 36:16.820
philosophy strike happened and we took it on in economics and we formed what's called the political

36:16.900 --> 36:23.780
economy movement and had a successful strike. We actually managed to pressure the university

36:23.780 --> 36:27.780
into establishing a department of political economy at Sydney University, as well as a

36:27.780 --> 36:28.820
department of economics.

36:28.820 --> 36:33.060
What was the foundational ideas? Were you resistant to the whole censorship of

36:34.100 --> 36:37.940
why can't you have a philosophy of anything kind of course?

36:37.940 --> 36:42.900
Well, it was much more libertarian in the genuine sense of the word,

36:42.980 --> 36:48.980
period of time at the end of the 60s, beginning of the 70s than the word libertarian has been

36:48.980 --> 36:54.020
corrupted since then. But it really was about free thought. And you went to university to learn. It

36:54.020 --> 36:58.660
was about education. I remember having a fight with my father once where dad was angry about the

36:58.660 --> 37:02.500
marks I was getting for some of my courses. And he said, if you don't get a decent result,

37:02.500 --> 37:06.580
you won't get a decent job. And I said, I'm not here to get a job. I'm here to get an education.

37:07.220 --> 37:07.700
Oh, wow.

37:07.700 --> 37:10.660
Okay. Now the thing is ultimately it's been a pretty good job for me as well.

37:11.220 --> 37:16.420
This is in Sydney, by the way, and Sydney in summer is absolutely gorgeous. And what does

37:16.420 --> 37:19.940
us bunch of lefties decide to do during summer but read Karl Marx?

37:19.940 --> 37:21.620
Yeah. On the beach or?

37:22.180 --> 37:27.220
Actually inside the room of the philosophy department at the University of Sydney

37:27.220 --> 37:31.540
in the main quadrangle. There's sandstone all around us. And we've a bunch of about

37:31.540 --> 37:33.620
20 or 30 of us reading our way through Marx.

37:33.620 --> 37:36.660
Capitao, like which capital?

37:36.740 --> 37:43.460
Volume one capital. And I remember walking off to that meeting with one of my friends,

37:44.020 --> 37:50.340
who's a law student. And this was a period of a huge construction boom in Sydney. So the whole

37:50.340 --> 37:54.820
skyline, which we could see from the campus was full of what they call kangaroo cranes,

37:54.820 --> 37:59.140
which were an Australian invention that are cranes that can be leapfrogged over each other

37:59.140 --> 38:00.740
to build a skyscraper.

38:00.740 --> 38:05.780
So here you are reading Karl Marx, looking at the mechanisms of capital.

38:05.780 --> 38:10.660
I looked at those mechanisms and I knew Marx argued that labor was the only source of value.

38:10.660 --> 38:12.580
And he said, machinery doesn't add value.

38:12.580 --> 38:14.660
So the cranes are worthless.

38:14.660 --> 38:18.020
I'm looking at these cranes and thinking, I want a very good explanation by Marx as

38:18.020 --> 38:22.980
to why these cranes don't add value. So reading through the first seven chapters of capital,

38:22.980 --> 38:27.940
what you found was Marx applying this dialectic. And like the ficti and stuff is bullshit. That

38:27.940 --> 38:32.420
is not how Marx thought at all. I was reading, trying to find the thesis, antithesis, synthesis,

38:32.420 --> 38:36.420
and it's not there at all in any of Marx's works. And I've read everything he's ever

38:36.420 --> 38:43.780
written on economics from 1844 to 1894 when his last books were published.

38:43.780 --> 38:47.700
There's not one word of mention of that. What he does talk about is foreground and background

38:47.700 --> 38:56.820
and tension. And his idea of a dialectic is that there is a unity will exist in society.

38:56.820 --> 39:00.020
And that unity can be individual, that can be a commodity, anything at all.

39:00.980 --> 39:07.140
The unity will be understood by that society. One particular aspect will be focused upon.

39:07.140 --> 39:13.140
So if you think about the human being in capitalism, the focus on the human being as an object

39:13.140 --> 39:18.260
is their capacity to work. You're a worker, okay? That's put in the foreground.

39:19.540 --> 39:23.700
The fact that you're human and you want to play a guitar and go surfing and make love and all the

39:23.700 --> 39:28.980
other things that humans do is pushed into the background. There's a tension between the two of

39:28.980 --> 39:35.060
those. And that can transform that unity over time. And that's a beautiful dynamic vision

39:36.260 --> 39:39.780
of change. So dialectics is a philosophy of change.

39:39.780 --> 39:45.700
So synthesis, antithesis is what? Does every idea have a counter argument?

39:45.700 --> 39:48.500
Yeah. There's a positive and negative and you bring them together somehow.

39:48.500 --> 39:51.540
And then Marx has this foreground, background, and tension.

39:51.540 --> 39:57.300
Foreground is all what we think of as economics and background is all the lovemaking we do as humans.

39:57.300 --> 39:58.340
That sort of thing.

39:59.220 --> 40:00.180
Why is there tension?

40:02.260 --> 40:08.980
If you imagine the unity, if you take a human in any preview, because you go back to Cro-Magnon days

40:08.980 --> 40:14.020
when we're living in caves and we've got to go hunting and cook food and stuff like that,

40:14.020 --> 40:19.380
but there's no social hierarchy. We've become used to. So you don't get labored as a worker

40:19.380 --> 40:24.580
or a capitalist. You're just a human in that situation. Then you've got more an integrated

40:24.580 --> 40:29.940
view of who you are. And I think that's one of the appeals of a genuine tribal culture,

40:29.940 --> 40:33.940
that you get treated for the whole of who you are. You've certainly categorized, you're male,

40:33.940 --> 40:39.140
you're female, you're young, you're old, you're a hunter, you're a toolmaker, et cetera, et cetera.

40:39.140 --> 40:43.620
But you're treated as a more integrated object. When you get put in a complex society like a

40:43.620 --> 40:48.740
capitalist society, then one side of you is emphasized and the others are de-emphasized.

40:48.740 --> 40:53.540
So is it fair to say that the background is like our basic fundamental humanity

40:54.020 --> 40:56.660
and the foreground is the machine of capitalism?

40:56.660 --> 41:00.900
Effectively. And when you look at it in terms of a human. But what Marx did is apply this to a

41:00.900 --> 41:07.140
commodity. So he said, what is the essential unity in a capitalist economy? And the essential unity

41:07.140 --> 41:10.180
is a commodity. The essential unit.

41:10.180 --> 41:12.500
The essential unity. What's unity?

41:12.500 --> 41:18.500
Unity is an object in society. So he started from the point of view of trying to understand

41:18.500 --> 41:24.020
how exchange occurs. How do we set prices? And his starting vision was to say that

41:24.020 --> 41:33.540
a commodity is a unity in a capitalist economy. The part of the unity that we focus upon is its

41:33.540 --> 41:39.940
exchange value. A capitalist produces a commodity, not because of its qualitative

41:39.940 --> 41:44.740
characteristics, but because it'd be sold for a profit. So the foreground aspect of a commodity

41:44.740 --> 41:50.420
is its exchange value. The background aspect of it, it won't succeed as a commodity unless

41:50.420 --> 41:55.060
it has a use value. So the background is the utility thing.

41:55.060 --> 42:01.460
Yeah. So if you made something which didn't work, okay, then you might be able to sell it,

42:01.460 --> 42:06.100
but it has no utility. You can't make that into a commodity. A broken thing can't be sold.

42:06.100 --> 42:09.700
Does that have the subjective? Yeah, it has to have the subjective side.

42:09.700 --> 42:12.740
So people enjoy it. As well as the objective. So the objective

42:12.740 --> 42:15.860
is what capitalists worry about. I'll give you my favorite counter example of that.

42:17.060 --> 42:22.260
I took a bunch of Australian journalists to China way back in the period when the Gang of Four was

42:22.260 --> 42:29.220
being on trial. And we did a tour of the Forbidden City in Beijing. And at that stage, all the

42:29.220 --> 42:34.820
artifacts of the royal family, the emperor, were actually in the building still. And we walked

42:34.820 --> 42:42.020
past one of them and it was this gold, solid gold bar about this long, shaped like a fist,

42:42.020 --> 42:47.300
turned over like this. And on this side, there were rubies, emeralds, diamonds. You'd never seen

42:47.300 --> 42:51.700
gemstones. I mean, gems that big. And one of the journalists asked me what I thought it was. And

42:51.700 --> 42:56.660
I said, oh, it's obvious. Jane is a back scratcher. Ha, ha, ha. I walked away. She caught up with me

42:56.660 --> 43:02.100
about 20 minutes later. I said, I asked one of the guides, it is a back scratcher. So here's a back

43:02.100 --> 43:06.740
scratcher for the emperor made of solid gold with diamonds and rubies and emeralds during the

43:06.740 --> 43:13.460
scratching. Now that's a commodity in a feudal society, okay? The cost doesn't matter. You want

43:13.460 --> 43:18.820
the most elaborate, beautiful thing because you are the emperor. So in that feudal society,

43:18.820 --> 43:24.660
the commodity, what's focused upon is the utility. And the cost of production when you're the emperor

43:24.660 --> 43:30.980
is immaterial. Capitalism reverses that. So the commodity in a capitalist economy is a plastic

43:30.980 --> 43:41.060
$2 scratchy you can get from Kmart or Target. And so the use value is necessary but irrelevant

43:41.060 --> 43:46.900
to forming the price. Now that was a completely different vision of exchange in capitalism to

43:46.900 --> 43:51.860
what I found in the neoclassical theory because that says it's the marginal utility and the

43:51.860 --> 43:58.180
marginal cost of everything that determines the exchange ratio. And the crazy thing about that is

43:58.180 --> 44:03.780
not so much the marginal utility, but the argument in the neoclassical theory is that

44:03.780 --> 44:09.700
the price ratio, the price will, when there's an exchange going on, there's two person, two commodity

44:09.700 --> 44:18.660
exchange of two commodities between two people. The price will change until such time as the

44:18.660 --> 44:24.260
ratio of the marginal utilities is equal to the ratio of the marginal costs. That's supposed to

44:24.260 --> 44:30.820
be the equilibrium. And Mark says that's bullshit. That's a previous society where you exchange stuff

44:30.820 --> 44:35.940
that you happen to have for stuff somebody else happened to have without any real production

44:35.940 --> 44:41.460
mechanism being involved. And he said, that's like when you have two ancient tribes meeting

44:41.460 --> 44:45.700
for the very first time and one tribe can make something the other tribe can't make.

44:46.260 --> 44:52.260
And they will therefore, the price they were willing to pay reflect how unique this other

44:52.340 --> 44:57.380
object is that this one tribe can make and the other can't. So for example, the story of Manhattan

44:57.380 --> 45:03.700
being sold for 40 glass beads, it's actually 40 glass trading beads. I believe it is a true story.

45:03.700 --> 45:09.140
But the thing is the Indians couldn't make glass beads. So they valued the glass beads

45:09.140 --> 45:13.860
at the island of Manhattan, which is a utility-based comparison. What Mark said,

45:13.860 --> 45:18.260
that's the very initial contact. Over time, even if you don't know the technology,

45:18.900 --> 45:24.260
over time you start to realize how much work goes involved in making what they're selling you versus

45:24.260 --> 45:31.620
what you're selling to them. And you start making stuff specifically for sale. So Elon's not losing

45:31.620 --> 45:38.260
personal utility each time a Model 3 goes out the door. He might get utility out of the fact

45:38.260 --> 45:43.220
that he's created that vehicle, that concept and manufactures it and so on, but he's not losing

45:43.220 --> 45:50.100
utility each time a Model T Ford goes out the door for going back for the ancient commodity there.

45:50.100 --> 45:57.540
So the utility plays no role in setting price in Mark's model, whereas it's essential

45:57.540 --> 46:01.700
in the neoclassical model. What's the difference between utility and marginal utility?

46:01.700 --> 46:08.340
What does the word marginal mean? And why is it such a problem? It turns marginal utility,

46:08.340 --> 46:12.420
well, the utility itself has different meanings than the two schools of thought. If you take the

46:12.420 --> 46:17.300
classical school of thought, which when Mark's comes from, utility is effectively objective.

46:17.860 --> 46:22.980
So the utility of a chair is that you can sit in it, not how comfortable it makes you feel.

46:24.740 --> 46:28.100
If you think about the utility of the chairs, we're both sitting and they're identical. From

46:28.100 --> 46:32.580
a classical point of view, we're both sitting. But from a neoclassical point of view, it's how

46:32.580 --> 46:37.860
comfortable it makes you feel. And that depends upon your subjective feelings of comfort. You

46:37.860 --> 46:42.180
might be far more comfortable in the identical chair that I'm sitting in than I am. And therefore,

46:42.180 --> 46:47.780
the comparison is difficult. And therefore, working out a ratio involves you've got a

46:47.780 --> 46:54.660
decline in your each time you give away a chair in exchange for an iPhone, you have a fall in

46:54.660 --> 47:02.180
your utility. And then therefore, you want a higher return because you're losing more utility

47:02.180 --> 47:06.340
each time. The more chairs you give away, the less utility you're getting from chairs. So there's a

47:06.340 --> 47:12.420
decline in your utility. That's your marginal utility. So it's including your subjective

47:12.420 --> 47:17.700
valuation in setting the price. And what Mark's pointed out is this is a caricature

47:18.340 --> 47:22.260
of actual change in a capitalist economy. Because we have in a capitalist economy,

47:22.260 --> 47:27.860
huge factories turning out huge quantities specifically for sale. They've got no utility

47:27.860 --> 47:35.940
to the seller unless they're sold. So it's a very different vision of how price is set.

47:35.940 --> 47:40.820
And Mark's used that to explain where profit comes from, but he made a mistake.

47:42.180 --> 47:49.060
And his argument was that talking about a worker as now your unity, this foreground,

47:49.060 --> 47:55.540
background tension thing, the foreground is that you hire a worker for their cost of production.

47:55.540 --> 48:03.220
And the cost of production is a subsistence wage. Okay? The utility to the buyer is the

48:03.220 --> 48:08.580
fact that they can work in a factory. Now it might take six hours, let's say,

48:08.580 --> 48:12.740
to make the means of subsistence. And that's the exchange value. And that's what the capitalist

48:12.740 --> 48:18.980
pays as a wage to the worker. But they can work in the factory for 12 hours. That's the utility.

48:20.580 --> 48:26.740
12 minus six is six surplus of value hours. And that's where profit comes from. And that

48:26.740 --> 48:31.540
was Mark's argument. And I thought it was brilliant, but it also applied to machinery.

48:32.180 --> 48:36.980
Right. Okay. No, no. Deep is good. You just wanted to find

48:37.860 --> 48:41.700
terms. Don't take that statement out of context, the internet, please. Okay.

48:43.860 --> 48:50.740
You said buyer, seller, worker in a factory. Who's the seller? Who's the buyer?

48:52.660 --> 48:57.860
Why is the worker the buyer? The worker's the commodity in this case.

48:57.860 --> 49:00.980
Because if you're going to make stuff in a factory, you've got to hire workers.

49:02.340 --> 49:06.340
And what Mark's is saying, the buyer in that situation is a capitalist. So what does the

49:06.340 --> 49:12.340
buyer pay? He says he pays the exchange value. Back to the commodity thing, because that's the

49:12.340 --> 49:16.340
starting point. He said the essential unity in a capitalist economy is the commodity.

49:16.900 --> 49:23.780
A commodity has two characteristics, exchange value and use value. Exchange value of a commodity

49:23.780 --> 49:29.140
in a capitalist economy will be its cost of production. The use value is what you do with

49:29.140 --> 49:34.500
it. Okay. Once you've purchased it. But labor is a commodity. In this case,

49:34.500 --> 49:42.100
when a worker is being hired for a job, yes. So the worker's labor has an exchange value

49:42.100 --> 49:49.140
and a use value as well. Use value. Use value of a worker's labor. Exchange value.

49:50.260 --> 49:57.540
Let me think about that. So the hours they put in. Is the use value.

49:57.540 --> 50:06.980
Interesting. So what does the worker want in this? What are the motivations? Are we not considering

50:06.980 --> 50:14.420
the worker in this context as a human being? Well, that's the next layer. What Mark's gave

50:14.420 --> 50:20.820
was just like a layered cake, starting from a foundation of saying straight commodity exchange,

50:20.820 --> 50:24.820
and then saying, well, you're treating the workers as a commodity. Now a commodity is something

50:25.780 --> 50:32.020
like this. So far as I'm aware, no soul. Okay. Not going to be complaining if I turn it upside

50:32.020 --> 50:38.580
down, it'll fall over. So there's no soul there as a human is both a commodity and a non-commodity.

50:39.300 --> 50:43.220
And therefore there'll be a tension in the person. I'm being treated as a commodity here. I'm being

50:43.220 --> 50:50.020
paid just enough to stay alive. I've got a wife and kids back at home. So that is another layer

50:50.740 --> 50:55.700
of thinking in Mark's. And on that layer he then says, well, workers will therefore demand more

50:55.700 --> 51:00.100
than their value. So that's when you get like political. You get political and you get money

51:00.100 --> 51:04.500
coming above that and so on. But the basic idea starts from the commodities, the fundamental

51:04.500 --> 51:11.860
unity in capitalism. The important commodity in Mark's thinking was the worker because that's

51:11.860 --> 51:16.420
where he said profit came from. Yeah. Okay. And then that explains the motivation of the capitalist

51:16.420 --> 51:21.540
and that ultimately is the labor theory of value and Mark's arguments about how

51:21.540 --> 51:27.540
capitalism will come to an end. Okay. So first of all, what is the labor theory of value?

51:27.540 --> 51:33.940
And actually before that, what is value? This is like me asking what's happiness.

51:35.220 --> 51:38.420
Is there something interesting to say about trying to define value?

51:38.420 --> 51:45.220
You vary. And this is a huge problem in economics is arguments over what does value mean. And the

51:45.220 --> 51:51.300
neoclassicals came down as that it's subjective. It's value is whatever you get out of it. It's

51:51.300 --> 51:56.500
your personal evaluation of something, your personal feelings. So they've got that very

51:56.500 --> 52:02.660
subjective idea of value. Whereas the Marxists and being inheritors of the classical school

52:03.220 --> 52:08.980
talk in terms of objective value. So the value is the number of hours it takes to make something

52:09.860 --> 52:14.900
or the effort. The value is the effort that goes into making something in the classical school.

52:14.900 --> 52:18.660
Well, that's just one measure of objective. Where do you fall?

52:19.700 --> 52:25.540
Where do you fall? Subjective versus objective spectrum.

52:25.540 --> 52:29.620
I think you have to have the capacity to move between one and the other

52:29.620 --> 52:33.700
in a structured way. My base model is the objective.

52:34.820 --> 52:38.500
But above that, as soon as you start talking about the worker, for example,

52:38.820 --> 52:45.140
then you get involved in the subjectivity. Because a worker will be angry,

52:46.260 --> 52:51.540
and justifiably so, about being treated as a commodity. Because I'm not a commodity,

52:51.540 --> 52:56.500
I'm a human being. And that's where Marx or political organization coming from.

52:58.100 --> 53:02.660
And that's subjective now. And then when you get to money itself, Marx actually said, well,

53:03.220 --> 53:07.540
what's the value of money? Now, if you use an objective theory of value, you would say, well,

53:08.340 --> 53:12.900
the value of money is its cost of production. What's the cost of producing a dollar? It's

53:12.900 --> 53:19.540
about two cents. So he said it can't be. The value of money cannot be its cost of production.

53:20.100 --> 53:25.780
Or the most value, I think if we remember the phrase properly, is value here as it must mean

53:25.780 --> 53:31.460
the uncertain expectations or subjective valuation.

53:32.580 --> 53:36.500
Uncertain expectation or subjective valuation. Okay. But he's okay with that?

53:36.500 --> 53:40.260
He was okay with that, because he could move between different levels. Because he had a

53:40.260 --> 53:45.940
structured foundation of this dialectical vision of foreground, background tension,

53:47.060 --> 53:52.580
commodity having use value, exchange value, and a gap between the two. When you're talking about

53:53.380 --> 53:57.700
machines, when you're buying stuff for production. And then at the next level,

53:57.700 --> 54:02.740
he could look at workers, worker organization, and say that's driven by being treated as a

54:02.740 --> 54:08.820
commodity when you're a non-commodity. So the basic labor theory of value

54:09.540 --> 54:15.700
that is described to Karl Marx is that value at the base layer fundamentally comes from

54:16.900 --> 54:23.460
the labor you put into something. And you say, well, there's some deep truth there,

54:23.460 --> 54:30.180
except he misses one fundamental point, which is machines can also bring value to the world.

54:30.180 --> 54:35.700
He was saying they don't. The only thing that matters is human labor,

54:36.340 --> 54:44.260
not labor. How do you measure what's the role of the whatever value machines bring to the world?

54:45.780 --> 54:51.380
This is another intriguing history, because Marx, when he first started, had what you can call

54:53.140 --> 54:58.340
an exclusivist explanation for why labor created value. And that was to say that

54:59.300 --> 55:04.500
the labor is the only commodity with both what he called commodity and commodity power.

55:05.220 --> 55:12.260
So you have labor and labor power. Labor is the, and I get fuzzy about this. I haven't read it for

55:12.260 --> 55:18.180
something like 30 years, but labor has both commodity and commodity power. The commodity is,

55:18.180 --> 55:23.220
you can buy labor, which is the means of subsistence. Labor power is the capacity to

55:23.220 --> 55:28.020
work inside a factory. There's a difference between the two. Therefore, that difference

55:28.020 --> 55:32.660
will give rise to surplus. And there's no other commodity that has this instance of commodity

55:32.660 --> 55:40.580
and commodity power. So that was his exclusivist argument. In the middle of 1857, he was visited

55:40.580 --> 55:48.740
by a guy called Otto Brau in his home in Chelsea. And Otto returned to Marx a copy of Hegel's,

55:49.540 --> 55:53.140
I think it's called Phenomenology of Right. I haven't read it, but that's the book.

55:54.020 --> 55:58.820
Marx was then at that stage reading through all the classical theorists again. And he was,

55:59.460 --> 56:05.700
suddenly he read Hegel again. And if you know Hunter S. Thompson, okay. Who doesn't know Hunter

56:05.700 --> 56:09.220
S. Thompson? Somebody who hasn't had enough drugs, obviously. But Hunter S. Thompson-

56:09.220 --> 56:11.860
He comes to you in a dream after you take your first-

56:11.860 --> 56:14.340
Mescaline or whatever. And of course we've all-

56:14.340 --> 56:18.020
If you know your drugs well enough, you can tell, okay, he's stoned, okay, he's on cocaine.

56:18.820 --> 56:22.980
Well, Marx suddenly, his writing style, in the middle of a book called the Grundrisse,

56:22.980 --> 56:25.860
completely changed. He switched from weed to cocaine.

56:25.860 --> 56:31.460
He switched from Ricardo to Hegel, okay. And what in Ricardo, he had this exclusivist argument about

56:31.460 --> 56:36.980
labor and suddenly Hegel is back talking in terms of dialectics, not actually using a word,

56:36.980 --> 56:42.660
but foreground and background and tension. And then he, that's where this use value, exchange value,

56:43.300 --> 56:48.740
attention thing came from, is rereading Hegel 13 years after he stopped reading philosophy.

56:48.740 --> 56:53.220
Because in 1844, he was reading just the economists.

56:53.220 --> 56:55.540
So you're saying Karl Marx is human after all.

56:55.540 --> 56:56.180
He's human.

56:56.180 --> 56:56.740
He could be-

56:56.740 --> 56:59.060
I would love to have a beer with Karl, for a wine.

56:59.060 --> 57:03.060
For Karl? He's Karl to you? He's Mr. Marx to me.

57:03.060 --> 57:06.500
Hang on. Maybe Karl to me, I'm afraid, after all these years.

57:06.500 --> 57:11.540
Yeah, yeah. You've had quite a journey together. So that's where, after Hegel,

57:11.540 --> 57:16.180
his interpretation of the dialects comes in the form of background, foreground and background.

57:16.180 --> 57:20.340
And then on page 267 of the Penguin edition of the Grundrisse-

57:20.340 --> 57:22.500
One early? Your memory-

57:22.500 --> 57:27.380
One and a half pages long footnote. It's pretty hard to forget. Because when I did this,

57:27.380 --> 57:34.020
when I first read Marx way, way back when I was, how old was I? Twenty. Okay. I tried to explain

57:34.020 --> 57:39.380
my explanation of Marx's use value, exchange value stuff to my colleagues in this philosophy

57:39.940 --> 57:44.660
discussion room at Sydney University during a beautiful summer that we are inside concrete

57:44.660 --> 57:50.020
sandstone walls discussing Marx. And I went to say, look, the use value, exchange value argument

57:50.580 --> 57:55.300
can be applied to a machine. What's the exchange value of a machine? It's cost of manufacturing it.

57:55.300 --> 58:00.820
What's its use value? Its capacity to produce goods for sale. No relation between the two.

58:00.820 --> 58:05.700
There'll be a gap. A machine can be a source of profit. Now I said that and I got laughed at,

58:05.700 --> 58:11.140
I quite literally laughed at. So when I went back to university 13 years later to do my master's

58:11.140 --> 58:17.860
degree, I chose to read through and find in Marx where he first came across this insight.

58:19.620 --> 58:25.700
My first master's thesis failed, by the way, and justifiably so. I was learning, I didn't know the

58:25.700 --> 58:32.580
level of academic discourse necessary. I had an advisor who didn't understand what I was writing.

58:32.580 --> 58:40.180
He got me to write for his new Keynesian audience and it was a mess and it got failed. So I got rid

58:40.180 --> 58:45.060
of him. Did it get failed? Why do you think? It wasn't a good thesis. I didn't know the level.

58:46.180 --> 58:50.020
It was written for an audience my supervisor thought that I should be writing for

58:50.660 --> 58:54.500
and it was a mess. And so I met another guy, Jeff Fishburne,

58:56.020 --> 59:02.420
as a lecturer at New South Wales University. And Jeff was open-minded. He was not a conventional

59:02.420 --> 59:07.540
neoclassical thinker. And I realized I'd throw out the half that Bill had got me to do,

59:08.260 --> 59:12.260
focused just on Marx. And so I decided to read Marx in chronological sequence

59:12.820 --> 59:17.060
from his very first works of economics, which are called The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts

59:17.060 --> 59:23.460
of 1844. And he wrote those in a garret in Paris after he'd been expelled from Prussia.

59:23.460 --> 59:30.180
And so he decided to read, having been an expert on philosophy and regarded as the towering

59:30.180 --> 59:35.700
intellect of Hegelian philosophy in Prussia, but driven out because he was a radical. He

59:36.180 --> 59:42.180
he ended up writing a, running a newspaper or being writing for a newspaper. And he was reporting

59:42.180 --> 59:48.500
about the eviction of peasants from the forests, taking away their feudal rights. And so this is

59:48.500 --> 59:55.700
where his passion for economics and humanity came from. And he was a poet as well. I mean, he wrote

59:55.700 --> 01:00:01.620
love poetry to Jenny von Westhalen. That's his first published works were pretty much in poetry.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:07.140
He was a rouse about, he was a wild character. We'd probably fight like crazy, I imagine,

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:11.940
if we met. Over the beers? I'm slightly, even though I can be,

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:19.700
I can get involved in an argument like nobody's business. No, really? No, really. But I'm a bit

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:26.020
more peaceful of personality. Oh, you think Marx is feistier than you? He was feisty, but feisty with,

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:31.380
he could be arrogant. Like I'm, I've got an intellectual arrogance. I've come to accept that.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.820
But there's like a fundamental humility to you. You're saying Marx is like, has ego that's hard

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.220
to control. A bit too big ego, yeah. I'm guessing. I mean, I'm never going to meet him. Well, the beard

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:46.980
says ego to me. The beard is huge, yeah. That's, that's huge. Okay. So this is interesting. So you

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:51.620
went chronologically. Right through his works. The development of the human being through his works.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.620
Yeah. And I was trying to find the point at which he discovered this use value exchange value

01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:02.420
idea. And it occurs in a footnote on page 267 to 268 of the Penguin Edition of the Guendrisa,

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:08.180
which his notes he was taking literally not meant for publication, literally sitting at a stall inside

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:14.340
the British Museum, I think, reading all the classical authors in chronological sequence.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:20.180
And then somebody throws hagel at him and suddenly he's talking in Hegelian terms. And he suddenly

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:26.020
says, is not, because it's whole value issues. What is values? Is exchange value, use value? How

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:31.380
do they relate to each other? That's what he was thinking about. And he said, is not use value,

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.220
which was left out of the classical school, a fundamental aspect of the commodity?

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.060
Is there not a tension between the use value and exchange value?

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:44.740
Just so we're clear in that context, use value is kind of the subjective thing. Exchange value is

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.260
the objective thing. Yeah. And Marx was found a way to integrate the two.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:56.580
But he was focused on labor being the only thing that can generate both the use value and the

01:01:56.580 --> 01:02:02.260
exchange value. But no. If you look at the classical school, they focus on exchange value,

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.940
objective. Look at the neo-classical, they face it upon use value, subjective, or they call it

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:13.860
utility. So Marx coming from the Ricardian tradition basically dismissed the role of utility.

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:20.420
And then when he reads Hegel, he's suddenly starting to think in terms of unities and

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:25.940
exchange value and use value is the unity of the commodity. And he thinks, well, I can't

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:31.460
ignore use value. So rather than leaving it out completely, which is what Ricardo and Smith does,

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:37.460
I've got to somehow bring it in. And this Hegelian insight occurs to him. And it's remarkable. I

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.060
really recommend taking a look at the book, even just to look at that particular page,

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:45.060
because what it would have been as shown as a footnote, but it would have been him saying,

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:51.860
oh, wow, and he's asterisk, asterisk is not use value, a fundamental aspect of the

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:56.180
unity of a commodity. So in the notes, you see the discovery of an idea in the human mind.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:00.340
And it's beautiful. The integration of an idea. And he actually writes, does this have significance

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:06.740
in economics? And then he probably went home that night and like that, that idea changed him.

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:11.060
It changed him completely. Okay. And from that point on, his writing was completely different,

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:16.020
but he still had this idea from the Ricardian days of saying that labor is the only source of

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:21.300
value using exclusive argument to say there's something unique about labor that explains why

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.620
it's a source of value. But suddenly this insight occurs to him and he thinks I can get a positive

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:31.380
derivation. I can use the use value and exchange value. And the fact they're not related to each

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:36.580
other as a dialectical tension to explain surplus value. And that's what he does. So he goes from

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:42.740
a negative explanation of where value comes from to a positive explanation on that page of the

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:49.540
Grand Risa. And he then triumphantly uses it to explain why labor is a source of value. You buy

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:54.740
it for its exchange value. You use its use value. They're unrelated. The use value will be bigger.

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:59.060
That's where profit comes from. Then he does exactly the same thing for machinery,

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:06.260
about 30 pages on. He says it also has to be contemplated, which was not done before.

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:13.140
Nice to himself, by the way. It's written really in a colloquial style. That the use value of a

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:17.700
machine is significantly greater than its exchange value. He actually left out the word is. It's

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.980
translation into English of the German, I'm sure. I haven't seen the original notes. I'd love to

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:32.660
see them. But he leaves out the word is. It also has to be contemplated that the use value

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:38.180
significantly greater than its exchange value, i.e. that the contribution of the machine to

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:47.060
production exceeds its depreciation. And that was an insight which undermined his explanation

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:55.780
for revolution. Okay. Can you say that again? The cost of production exceeds its depreciation?

01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:01.380
Can you linger on that? Well, what Marx argued, and you read this in Capital,

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.340
and I read this in Capital when I first saw the contradiction in his own thought,

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:13.940
he said that no matter how useful a machine is, whether it took 100 hours to make or cost 150

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:20.100
pounds, it cannot, under any circumstances, add more to production than 150 pounds.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:30.100
Which, in his old exclusivist logic, he could justify and which in his post-1857 argument is

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:35.300
bullshit. Can you steel man his case? Can we go to the mind of Marx and thinking,

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:43.380
if a machine costs 100 bucks, it can't bring more value than 100 bucks to the world? But that

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:50.100
contradicts his previous logic because what he said is commodities are the essential unity in

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:56.580
capitalism. Capitalism focuses upon the exchange value. That pushes the use value into the

01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:01.700
background, and there's a tension between the two. What that means is the exchange value of

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:07.780
a commodity sets its price. The use value is independent. He called them incommensurable.

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:12.980
He literally used the word incommensurability between exchange value and a use value,

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.940
whereas neoclassicals make them commensurable. So he's saying exchange value and use value

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:23.220
incommensurable. And that normally means that exchange value is objective, the number of

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:27.780
hours it takes to make something. Use value is subjective, how comfortable the chair is,

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.580
the fact that you can sit in a chair. So that's incommensurability. But when you apply it in

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:38.020
production, the exchange value of something is objective. It's how many hours it takes to

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:42.500
make a machine or how many hours it takes to make the means of subsistence for a worker.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:48.740
The use value is also objective. You're making commodities for sale, and the worker does six

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:55.460
hours of work will make them the means of subsistence for the worker, but the worker

01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:01.540
will work a 12-hour day, and the six hours becomes a gap. Now, that's incommensurability

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:06.660
between use value and exchange value of labor. But when you look at what he said about no matter

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:12.500
how long it takes to make a machine or how many pounds it costs, he's saying they're identical,

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:17.860
and that's contradicting his own logic. Well, what's the use value of a machine?

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:25.060
In fact, it can produce goods for sale, exactly the same as the worker. Now, in my modern

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:32.260
reinterpretation of Marx, which brings in my work on energy, I see both labor and machinery

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:38.420
as a means to harness energy and produce useful work. And they can both do that. In fact,

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:44.180
they do it together. It's a collective enterprise. Okay. And we'll go to that. So

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.740
there's no fundamental difference from an exchange value and use value perspective

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.700
between a human and a machine. And therefore, using the same logic,

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:57.620
they can both be a source of surplus, which is what Marx contradicted because his explanation

01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:04.260
for where socialism would come from is that only profit comes from labor. Over time, it'll add

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:09.540
more machinery than labor. That will mean a falling rate of profit and therefore a tendency

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:15.780
towards socialism. And what he did in that insight in 1857 is contradict his own idea

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:19.220
about what would lead to socialism. And he couldn't cope with it.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:29.060
Okay. What's the difference between Marxian economics and Marxist political ideology?

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:33.700
The gap between the two, the overlap, the differences, what-

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:38.980
The real foundation of Marx's political philosophy was the economic argument that

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:44.900
there would be a tendency for the rate of profit to fall. And that tendency for the rate of profit

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:50.660
to fall would lead to capitalists battening down on workers harder, paying them less than

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:57.460
their subsistence, or revolt by workers against this. And then you would get socialism on the

01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:03.700
other side. So what he called the tendency for the rate of profit to fall played a critical role

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:07.300
in his explanation for why socialism would have to come about.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.580
He was saying it would have to come about or is it a good thing for it to come about?

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:19.700
He had assured, but he was trying to say it must. So if you look at Marx in the history of

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:24.020
radical thought, he was preceded by what were called utopian socialists.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:30.420
Saint-Simon, even the Cadbury's company came out of utopian socialist. And they had an idea about

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:35.460
a perfect society in the future where people were properly rewarded, were treated as human beings

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:39.860
rather than cogs in a machine and all this sort of stuff. And they said socialism should come about

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:46.100
because it treats humans better than capitalism does. Marx said, I can prove that socialism must

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:53.060
come about. So he preferred, he had a utopian vision of a future society, but he thought he

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:59.700
could prove that it had to come about. And the proof relied critically upon tendency for the rate

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.620
of profit to fall. And that relied upon labor being the only source of profit.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:10.580
What was his utopian view? So this idea from each according to his ability

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:14.900
to each according to his needs, is that the utopian?

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:23.140
I think it's utopian in the context of our modern world. It says that rather than being

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:29.940
rewarded like Jeff Bezos gets enormous fortune, you get what you need, not what you want,

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:35.540
necessarily. All needs is fulfilled. It was a vision of utopia where you could be a

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:41.700
fisherman in the morning, a poet in the afternoon and a chef at night. Okay, this

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:46.500
paraphrasing one of his phrases. So he did have a utopian vision of a future society.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.940
And he did think human creativity would be much, much greater under socialism

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.660
than it was under capitalism. He was wrong.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:58.660
So let's explore in different ways where he was wrong. You're saying there's a fundamental flaw

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:05.940
in the logic, but also if we can link, if we can explore the high level philosophical concepts of

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:13.540
socialism too, like the dreams of a utopia. Yeah. So what, first of all, what is socialism?

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:18.420
That's another loaded term. It is. Socialism, particularly in America,

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:24.660
is a very loaded term. And what Americans call socialist is a large amount of provision of

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:29.860
services by the state, which is commonplace in Europe. It's still moderately commonplace

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:38.420
in my own home country of Australia. And that Americans will call public education socialist.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:45.300
It's a total parody of the word. Strictly speaking, what socialism meant is the public ownership of

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.340
the means of production, no private ownership of the means of production. What is the means

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:56.020
of production? Machine factories, factories. So all the goods that are produced in factories,

01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:03.140
no, the means of producing the goods is owned by a centralized entity. Yeah. Centrally planned. This

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:09.460
is what actually was done under Gold's plan under the Soviets. And even with the collective farms

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:14.820
as well, you no longer own your land. The state owns the land, you worked on the land.

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:19.140
And this was supposed to be a utopia. Right. Now it didn't turn out to be one.

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:25.140
And we'll talk about maybe your ideas of why it didn't turn out to be one. So the fascists did the

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:30.900
same. So is this fascism also central? Fascism, so-called national socialism.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.900
It's also a kind of socialism. So yeah, but there was no, it wasn't public

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:39.460
ownership. There was public direction. So the state would tell factories what to do. There's still

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:43.860
private profit. And a large part of why the Nazis succeeded was the extent to which they managed to

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:53.540
co-opt major manufacturers in Germany. So it's direction versus ownership. It's a dictatorial,

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:58.580
I mean, that's a very particular implementation. So you have to consider the full details of the

01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:05.140
implementation, but it's basically dictator guided versus owned.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:09.300
If you want to take a proper vision, then you have to say it's the ownership of the means of

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:15.620
production by the state versus the ownership by private. That rules out the Nazi period.

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.940
They use the word that again, they're bastardizing as much as Americans do

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:25.620
in the opposite direction. Well, what does ownership exactly mean?

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:34.820
Well, it became incredibly complicated. And this is actually the best work on this is done by

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:40.420
recently deceased Hungarian economist called Janos Kornay. And Kornay tried to explain why

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:47.300
socialism failed. Why did socialism fail in your view? In his view, in Janos' view, in your view?

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:51.940
I think Janos is 100% correct. And it's a brilliant piece of work. So I'm going to be really

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:58.740
paraphrasing his view. And he imagined an ideal socialist society and there wasn't a Stalin,

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:04.180
there weren't purges, and you lived up to all the ideals that Marx had for socialism.

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:10.900
But you do it in a context of an economy which is incredibly primitive, Russia. Because if you look

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:16.180
at Marx's own vision of the revolution, it was going to happen in England. The advanced economies

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:21.620
would be first to go through the revolution. The primitive economies would have to go through a

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:26.420
capitalist transition. And this is the difference between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks.

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:31.060
So the Mensheviks, when Hyman Minsky came out of the Menshevik family, the Mensheviks believed you

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:35.460
had to go through a capitalist phase. Russia had to go through a capitalist period before it becomes

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:42.020
socialist. The Bolsheviks believed they could get there in one go. Bypass the capitalist phase,

01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:48.500
do the development under socialism rather than under capitalism. And this is what Janos was

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:56.580
actually analyzing. You start from a primitive feudal economy, very little industrialization,

01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:05.220
and you want to jump to an advanced industrial society from that foundation. So he said what you

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:11.140
have then for is a whole range of industries, all of which need as much resources as you can

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:19.460
get for them. So you want to develop agriculture, mining, industry, every little division of it.

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:23.460
They all have legitimate demands on the resources of the country and the state.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.260
That means that all your resources are fully employed and are probably over employed.

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:34.580
So you have a resource constraint in that society. The easiest way to cope with a resource

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:40.980
constraint is to produce last year's commodity, not to innovate, not to make change. So what they

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:46.980
will give you is as you start to add, you invest, so you now have the beginnings of a steel industry,

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:52.100
beginnings of a car industry and so on, you start investing, but you continue producing the same

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.940
product you made last year. And I have a perfect personal example of that, which I'll throw in now

01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:05.940
if you like, a pretty heavy conversation. My first major girlfriend had a brother who wanted

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:13.220
to get a motorbike, but he couldn't afford a Honda or a Kawasaki. At the time, they cost about $3,000

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:22.420
for a 650cc Japanese motorbike. He found he could buy a Cossack for $650, $1 per cc.

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:30.500
So I was there when I got this. This is in suburban Sylvania waters in Sydney. So this

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:36.980
crate arrives with the Cossack motorbike inside it. So we take it apart. It's then got all these

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:41.380
wooden palings. We have to pull off the wooden palings to open it up. Then there's oil-saked

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:46.980
rag over this thing, which is tied on a wooden base. We take the oil-soaked rag off and we

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:53.540
stare in all its glory in a 1942 BMW. It was exactly the same as Steve McQueen in

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:59.700
The Great Escape. So the Russians, for 30 years, were making the same bloody motorbike. It had

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:06.340
a bicycle seat. That's how they coped. They just made the same damn machine every year.

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:11.620
They said, so that's the outcome. You actually want the best possible world. You're trying to

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:16.180
build as fast as possible. You're paying workers as high wages as you possibly can,

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:22.020
and that leads to a world where you don't innovate. But you said capitalism, on the other hand,

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.020
pure capitalist economy. You're trying to pay workers as little as possible.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:31.380
You have competitive industries. You're trying to take demand away from your rivals. You have

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:39.060
Kawasaki versus Honda versus BMW, et cetera, et cetera. The way you get demand away from

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:44.020
your competitors is by innovating. So what you will get is cycles and burns and slumps,

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:49.700
but you'll innovate and change over time. So what you found was this huge gap between socialist

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:56.420
volume production with no innovation and capitalism with innovation. So that was the

01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:03.380
fundamental failing that Janos Kornasoi saw. Why did socialism not innovate? Because if you go back

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:09.700
to his famous historical incident with Khrushchev in the United Nations, he takes off his shoe and

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.860
bangs the desk and says, we will bury you. He literally meant we're going to bury you in

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:18.020
commodities. We're going to produce more output than you are. And he was wrong.

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:25.140
Because fundamentally, in the long term, to bury somebody in commodity production,

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:32.740
you have to innovate. Yeah. And there's another remarkable Soviet engineer who was given the job

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:38.660
of interpreting Marx's ideas of industrial sectors. So he had the commodity sphere,

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.780
the industry sphere, sector one, sector two, sector three. Sector one producing consumer goods,

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:48.580
sector two producing capital goods, sector three producing luxury goods for capitalists.

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:54.100
And so he had a three-sector model of the economy. And he was talking about the dynamics between them.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:59.540
And what Feldman did was reinterpret this as an engineer would reinterpret it, which was brilliant

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:06.740
work. So what he said was, you need to produce the means of production. If you want to grow quickly,

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:11.540
you focus on producing the means of production rather than commodities. So you don't make cars,

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:16.580
you make car factories. Okay. You make a few cars, but most of the effort goes into expanding how

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:21.140
many factories you have. And what he did was do a mathematical model where you start off with very

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:26.580
low levels of consumer good output, but then you would just go exponential. Okay. Now I took a look

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:32.660
at that back when I was doing my master's degree and training in mathematics. I took Feldman's

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:39.380
equations and then looked at what was actually driving it was he was imagining correctly a huge

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:44.500
pool of unemployed labor. If you go back to the earliest stages of Soviet industrialization back

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:49.940
in 1917, post the second world, post the first world war, you had all these unemployed workers,

01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:54.180
you had all these peasants you could take off the land and put into factories. So you had a huge

01:19:54.180 --> 01:20:00.500
supply of workers. What you had to do was build the factories. So you're building the factories,

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:08.420
but at a certain point you exhaust the supply of lowly employed or unemployed labor. And so rather

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:13.940
than having this exponential takeoff, you hit a ceiling and then you can only grow as fast as the

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:19.540
population because you're not innovating. Okay. So that's what actually hit the Soviet system.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:25.540
And it's why they never buried the Western consumer goods. And instead why was Eastern

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:30.580
consumers looked in envy at the goods being purchased by their Western people and said,

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:35.860
if that's exploitation, we want exploitation. So, okay, there's a lot of interesting stuff to

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:45.460
ask here, which is, so Marx's vision for the socialist utopia is you have to go through

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:51.140
capitalism. The Mensheviks were true to Marx's original idea. Right. So is there

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:58.020
a case to be made that in the long arc of human history on like human civilization on earth,

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:04.980
that we're going to live out Marx's vision for utopia, which is like,

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.140
will we run into a wall with capitalism? I think we are running into a wall with capitalism. In

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.180
fact, I think we've already gone through the wall and we haven't yet realized we've smashed our

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:22.660
skulls. Okay. But on the other side, we're bleeding and everything like that. Does Marx

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:26.340
have any insights on what the other side of capitalism, what is beyond capitalism?

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:30.740
I think that beautiful phrase of from each according to his ability to each according to

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:38.020
his needs describes what we should end up with. And I think that's actually, if I think about,

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:43.700
you know, I'm an Elon Musk fan. That's what I think is partially going to be the nature of society

01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:49.620
if we build one that functions on Mars. Because, and I've actually seen the interview with the

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:55.380
Italian who's involved in designing what the future colony will look like. He was actually

01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:00.580
asked this question, can there be enormous inequality in Martian civilization? The guy said,

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:06.740
absolutely not. Because the resources, again, resource constraint applies. You simply can't

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:14.100
give somebody an underground bunker 100 times the size of somebody else's 100 underground bunker.

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:22.020
The scarcity of resources imposes a need for equality overall.

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:26.500
Is that always, that's interesting. I mean, the scarcity of resources. Wait,

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.420
but I feel like that's the contradiction. I thought-

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:31.540
Are you thinking neoclassical about scarcity?

01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:40.900
I'm barely thinking at all. So wait, I thought scarcity,

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:44.740
the best way to build on top of scarcity is a capitalist type of machine.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:50.340
No, this is where, again, our vision of what scarcity is, is wrong. Because,

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:56.580
and Ricardo said this is actually better than Marx, because Ricardo said there are some products

01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:04.980
whose value is determined entirely by their scarcity. Paintings, rare wines, et cetera,

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:09.220
et cetera. He said, they are things you cannot reproduce in a factory. He said,

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:14.740
the essence of capitalism is what you can make in a factory. And therefore, for these unique objects,

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:22.420
these rare objects, Picasso painting, a beautiful bottle of wine, et cetera, et cetera, then the

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:28.820
utility, it can't be reproduced easily. So its price will be determined by subjective valuation.

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.020
He said, what we're talking about in capitalism is the stuff you can make en masse.

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:38.980
And that is the true focus of the capitalist economy. And that is not about scarcity. That

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:44.420
is about, the only scarcity applies when you don't have the resources to make them anymore,

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:48.820
or you can't use the energy involved because you'll damage the biosphere too much, which

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:55.060
we've already done. But fundamentally, the scarcity that neoclassicals have made us think

01:23:55.060 --> 01:24:00.180
about, and Austrians think about as well, is non-reproducible. But the essence of capitalism

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:03.780
is the commodity, the backscratcher, the two-buck backscratcher that anybody can,

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:07.300
you know, the cheapest chips to make, and that's why it can make a profit out of them.

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:13.780
Not the elaborate gold thing with diamonds and rubies that only the king gets. So we think,

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:19.460
our vision of scarcity has been perverted by neoclassicals analyzing the exception

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:26.180
to capitalism and calling it capitalism. Okay, fair enough. So, you know, let's put

01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:30.420
Mars aside because I think there's a lot of strange factors that have to do with the whole

01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:38.500
another planet, civilization that we don't quite understand. Like how economics works

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:46.980
with different geographic locations, one of which have new challenges, which is what essentially

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:49.780
this is. I don't know if you can apply the same economic theory.

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:54.900
No, I'm saying your question, I think, will be forced into that ultimately by having to make

01:24:54.900 --> 01:25:00.420
a compromise with the ecology. And we've been ruthless about the ecology of this planet,

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:07.060
and we're going to pay the price for it. So if you have a planet where you can't be ruthless,

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:17.140
you have to mind it as carefully as possible, then that utopian might be imposed upon you for

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:24.020
the needs for survival on that planet. Back here, Marx's utopia was still the one that ignored the

01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:31.620
ecology. And I think if I have a vision of a utopia in future, it's got bugger all to do about

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:39.940
what humans get out of it. It's what humans respect. They have to respect life. I see that

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:45.220
as a one-eyed utopia, a utopia for a single species, as if it can exist on its own,

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.500
which we should know it can't. A quick bathroom break?

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:55.060
Yeah, that would be great. We took a little bit of a break and now we're back. We needed to take

01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:59.940
a break because my brain broke and I'm piecing it back together. You mentioned ecology and life and

01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:13.860
the value of all of that. We'll return to it if we can. But first, we said why this idea of why

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:22.100
socialism failed. Can we linger on this a little bit longer? How did the ideas of Karl Marx lead

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:30.980
to Stalinism? This particular implementation, is there something fundamental to these ideas

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:37.540
that leads to a dictator and that leads to atrocities? There's something about the

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:46.660
mechanism of the bureaucracy that's built that leads to a human being that's able to attain,

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:54.820
integrate absolute power and then start abusing that power, all that kind of stuff. Some of the

01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:01.140
history of the 20th century, is that inextricably connected to the ideas of Karl Marx?

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:06.260
I think to some extent it is, but I'm going to also say that if it hadn't been for the Bolsheviks

01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:10.420
interpreting Marx and saying we can reach socialism without going through capitalism,

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:22.020
then it might not have happened. The Mensheviks were a rival political group in Russia and that's

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:26.740
where Hyman Minsky was a huge inspiration for me. He's an economist who was maybe,

01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:33.220
can we take a little tangent, who was Hyman Minsky? Hyman Minsky was the person who developed

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:40.980
analysis of capitalism based on financial instability. He was actually the PhD student

01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:47.380
of Joseph Schumpeter and an Austrian economist as well, whose name I've forgotten temporarily.

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:58.660
His parents were both refugees from Russia during the Stalinist period because the Mensheviks were

01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:06.340
being wiped out in Russia, just like any other opponents to the Bolsheviks were being eliminated.

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:13.140
I think his parents met in Chicago, still remain socialist, still remain politically active,

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:22.020
and he was educated in a family that was just imbued with Marx as its vision. He ended up

01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:28.740
fighting in the Second World War on the American side, coming back to America and studying

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:35.540
mathematics and then also doing an economics degree leading to a PhD. The question he posed

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:42.820
for himself is what causes Great Depressions? He put it beautifully. He said, can it happen again,

01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:49.220
it being the Great Depression? If it can't happen, then what has changed between the society

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:54.100
before the First Second World War and after that makes a depression impossible?

01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:56.500
What's the answer to those two questions? Can it happen again?

01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:02.580
His answer was yes, it can happen again, but what has prevented it happening by the time he

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:09.940
started writing about it, which was the late fifties to the mid-eighties, late eighties. We

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.940
met once, but only once. Over a beer?

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:18.580
No, he gave a seminar at New South Uni and a bit of an obstreperous bastard.

01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:21.380
Obstreperous.

01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.100
Wow. What is it?

01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:28.660
It means argumentative and likely to dismiss you. A good mate of mine was the guy who brought him

01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:32.580
out to Australia, a guy called Graham White. G'day, Graham. We're still good mates.

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:35.620
G'day, Graham. I love your language and your accent.

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:39.140
It's a great... Actually, there's a really good TikTok I saw earlier today

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:42.900
with an Aboriginal guy saying he loves the Australian language because it's absolutely

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:47.780
ironic. You ask an Australian a question and he'll give you an answer, which is the opposite of what

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:51.700
he means, and you've got to work out the rest for yourself. He goes up to another Aboriginal

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:56.500
mate and says, g'day, mate. He says, how are you doing? Not bad. What have you been doing recently?

01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:04.260
Not much. When are we going? Not too far, not too soon. Whereas not too far away.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.820
All negatives. He's a beautiful, beautiful rendition.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.780
That's the cool thing about the internet culture.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:15.540
They appreciate that ironic side. For example, the best compliment you can give

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:20.820
as an Aboriginal to somebody else is, that's deadly. That's a compliment. That's deadly.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:25.300
Another mate of mine, this comes from the Australian language, if I call you a bastard,

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:28.500
that's a compliment. Depending on how I intonate the word bastard.

01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:36.420
Bastard. Bastard. That's deadly. I love that. There's something, unfortunately,

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:41.620
there's something about the British accent that makes people sound

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:48.180
maybe brilliant, maybe sophisticated. But actually pompous.

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:54.900
Yeah. No, that's unfortunately the downside of that is you can sound pompous. There's something

01:30:54.900 --> 01:31:03.540
about the Australian accent that you just can't sound brilliant. It humbles you. You sound like

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:09.300
you're having a lot of fun. There's wit, there's all that stuff, but you just can't be like Karl

01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:14.420
Marx in an Australian accent would just not come off. That is a very good point.

01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:21.620
He would not be able to pull off the beard. It's fascinating that the accent determines

01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:29.140
something about the person. Maybe it's the chicken and the egg too. It drives the way of the discourse.

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:31.940
Obviously, there's a lot of brilliance. There's a lot of brilliance in your work,

01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:37.460
but it sounds like you're always having fun. Yeah. Look, Poncho has got a lot of Australian

01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:43.780
mates here. How long in Australia? A year and a half. He's got all these mates who

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:49.940
replace Aussie Rules football in Austin. You should join them one day. It's a very creative

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:55.220
sport. It's much more fun. It's different than rugby? Oh, very. Rugby is hopeless. Rugby is two

01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:03.220
morons smashing their bodies against each other. Easy now. We do not mean to offend the rugby fans

01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:10.580
and the audience. It's too simplistic. It's too simplistic. There's skill in it. I've seen some

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:16.660
really skillful rugby union and rugby league plays in my day, but fundamentally, if you hit somebody

01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:22.740
hard enough, they go down. Whereas in Aussie Rules, it's about catching the ball and then kicking the

01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:29.380
ball. More skill, less power. More skill. The bodies of the athletes, I can actually get off

01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:34.500
and measure what a sport is like by the bodies it creates. You get these incredibly elegant,

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:41.060
lithe muscular forms out of Aussie Rules. Such beautiful words you have in your vocabulary.

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:47.220
Lithe, I don't even know. I'll assume you know what it means and maybe somebody in the audience.

01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:53.140
Okay. All right. Fine. Fine. We should also mention that you've, in your youth,

01:32:54.100 --> 01:33:00.180
you know, like last year, have had Olympic weightlifting as part of your life.

01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:05.140
Long time ago. And like you said, tennis, I also played tennis for many, many, many, many years.

01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:10.500
Okay. Yeah. It's a fascinating game. It's a wonderful game. Yeah. That's my favorite game.

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:21.940
Karl Marx and Stalin. Yeah. So how do we get onto Aussie football, Australian and the accent?

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:27.060
I'm not really sure you talked about the way I said something about Karl Marx and

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:31.300
with Karl Marx. Anyway, we got there. Yeah, we got there and now we return.

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:33.780
But back to Marx, I think- It's not the destination, it's the journey.

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:40.500
I think Marx, the failure of socialism with Janos Kornai captured beautifully. This idea

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:46.660
already called demand constrained versus resource constrained economies. And capitalism is demand

01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:51.300
constrained. Okay. And this is again where neoclassical theory is completely wrong,

01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:56.500
empirically completely wrong. So the neoclassicals have a vision of capitalism being resource

01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:02.260
constrained, and it's about maximizing your usage of resources subject to constraints.

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:06.900
And as Kornai said, that's really what happened under socialism. What happens under capitalism

01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:13.700
is that you have 15, 20 companies producing automobiles. They are all trying to capture

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:17.860
as much of the market as they can. If you add up their marketing plans, you're going to get 120,

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:24.020
130% of the actual market. So they're all going to have excess capacity. When you build a factory,

01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:28.580
you're building it with a plan for it to exist for five, 10, 15 years. You have to have excess

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:33.780
capacity in the factory. So that means that capitalism has far greater productive capacity

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:38.660
than it actually uses. And then the way that you manage to get demand into your factory is

01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:43.380
to innovate and produce something nobody else does, or you're producing in volume. And when

01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:48.740
somebody produces like a bung tire, comes out of Firestone, then Goodyear is ready to expand its

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:54.100
production and take advantage of that. So that's the actual nature of competition in capitalism.

01:34:54.100 --> 01:35:00.100
And that means that we get a cornucopia of goods. Even if we're lowly workers, the variety of goods

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:06.420
in capitalism is overwhelming. And that just doesn't happen in socialism. You get your 1942

01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:10.740
cost sack as your motorbike, that's it. When you put your money down to buy a refrigerator,

01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:16.180
it'll arrive in 10 years because the factory is already fully constrained. So all these

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:21.780
resource constraints mean that people aren't happy under socialism. And if you've got a

01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:27.540
whole bunch of people that aren't happy, then the best way to control them is to suppress them.

01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:32.900
So I think in that sense, ultimately, yes, it does lead to something like Stalinism.

01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.100
So it's easier to give happy people freedom.

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:42.660
Yeah, I mean, happy people get pretty silly outside. The extent to which Americans overuse

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:49.780
and distort the word freedom drives me balmy. All of these words can be distorted, but they all

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:55.700
at the core have some fundamental power and beauty. And then we just distort on the surface

01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:58.900
for the fun of it, just to start battles on Twitter and so on.

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:04.660
But what citizens of the Soviet world didn't feel was freedom. First of all, it wasn't freedom

01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:08.420
to buy commodities. The commodities are supposed to be on the shops, weren't there.

01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:13.140
The volume couldn't be produced. And what you then got out of that as well was the,

01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:17.060
you know, the classic Soviet joke, they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work.

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:20.260
Okay. Yeah, so you're not motivated.

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:26.580
Oh, look, I went to Cuba about eight years ago, invited to give a talk there. And staying in a

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:32.100
hotel itself, the hotel is a story. There's one day my meetings were canceled. So I thought I

01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:36.580
might go down to the beach. And in the hotel, they had a wing, which is the tourist office.

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:40.500
And there were three women working inside the office. So I thought I'd just go up and ask them,

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:45.380
you know, how do I get to the beach? And one of them says to me, and I stood there,

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:51.060
just stood in the room, waiting to see if they'd make eye contact with me. Three women,

01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:55.300
nobody else in the place. None of them looked at me. So I finally went up to one of them and said,

01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:59.140
I want to go to the beach and do some surfing. She said, I can get a taxi outside.

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:05.060
Now, fundamentally, she was saying, well, I'm being paid shit money here. I'm not going to,

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:11.940
I don't want to work. I'm not going to do anything apart from sit here and qualify for my time.

01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:16.660
And as much as there are reasons the Cubans have suffered from American embargoes and all

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:22.340
that sort of stuff, you've still got that fundamental shortage economy that Corneille spoke

01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:28.020
about coming out of the structure of central ownership and central control of distribution

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:31.860
and investment. It breaks my heart because I think some of the effects of that

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.580
persist throughout time. It becomes part of the culture too.

01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:39.380
Yeah. Yeah. It's very interesting. Negative culture.

01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:42.900
Yeah. Yeah. Well, from the Western perspective.

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:47.460
Well, even from the people living through it. I mean, I had enough conversation with Cubans,

01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:54.340
you know, meeting them on the street, hopping in a cab. One guy I was talking to, he was an industrial

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:58.500
chemist and you've got a bit of money being a cab driver because he could make money out of

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:03.620
taking foreign tourists from the airport to the city. By the way, this episode is brought to you

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:10.500
by delicious Coca-Cola. That's why I didn't want to have it on camera, but anyway.

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:15.220
No, maybe they'll actually sponsor. You want to make sure you rotate the label to show.

01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:18.980
This is capitalism. What are we talking about here? Even though it's red.

01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:22.660
Black is actually anarchist.

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:27.060
I should tell you, I don't know if you know who Michael Mallis is.

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:28.420
Michael. Michael Mallis.

01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:34.020
He's an anarchist and he lives next door. Okay. No, I've lost touch with anarchist philosophy.

01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:40.980
I actually used to read, you know, Kropotkin and Bakunin and so on. And I enjoyed their philosophy

01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:46.180
and then I helped organize an anarchist conference once. And that was the biggest antidote possible

01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:48.180
to being an anarchist.

01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:53.300
That sounds like an entry point to a joke. I helped to organize an anarchist party.

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:58.740
It is. I mean, we literally spent three days arguing over whether there should

01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.620
or should not be a chairperson for conversations.

01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:04.100
Yeah. Well, that may be that-

01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:10.020
Monty Python's Life of Brian was lived out live.

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.420
Look at the bright side of life.

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:20.180
All right. So part of that explains why, for example, even to this day in some of those

01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:27.460
parts of the world, entrepreneurship does not flourish. There's not a spirit in the

01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:31.380
people to start businesses, to launch new endeavors and all those kinds of things.

01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:37.940
We're just taking all kinds of strange little strolls, but how do you explain

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:47.380
the mechanisms of China today where there's quite a bit of sort of flourishing of businesses

01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:51.060
and so on? It's a very peculiar kind of entrepreneurship.

01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:57.140
They got away from central control, but they still manage central political control but

01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.140
diversified economic control.

01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:03.140
So there's a, you could, it is possible to draw a line between politics-

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:06.500
It is possible. And I think in some ways, China's more likely to survive as a society

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:11.300
going into the future than Western capitalist societies are.

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:19.060
So it's like, if we do the Karl Marx, the foreground and the background, you can

01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:30.260
centralize the politics, the humanity, the subjective stuff, and then distribute the

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:30.980
objectives.

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:36.260
You've got to have the goods. And that's the big change from Mao to Zhang Xiaoping,

01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:40.980
characterized in that little saying that, I don't care whether you have a black cat or

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:42.820
a white cat, so long as it catches mice.

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:48.980
And there was a level of pragmatism to the Zhang Xiaoping revolution over Mao and

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:55.220
Madame Mao in particular. And that was manifest in the desire to get as much of those Western

01:40:55.220 --> 01:41:00.740
goods as possible. And I was actually in China in 81, took a group of journalists there,

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:02.500
as I mentioned earlier, for a tour.

01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:08.820
We ended up going to the Sichuan Free Trade Zone. And that gave us an idea of why

01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:15.780
China was going to succeed, because they had a rule that you couldn't just come in and

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:21.140
exploit the cheap wages. You had to also have a Chinese partner. And within five years,

01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:26.100
the Chinese partner had to earn 50% of the business, which is huge.

01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:30.500
And that gives you an idea of the reduction in wages these American corporations were

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:34.580
looking at. They'd shut down the factory in what's now the Rust Belt of America,

01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:39.700
that might be paying somebody there, you know, at that time, maybe $2 an hour.

01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:42.500
And they come across to China and they're paying two cents an hour.

01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:49.380
So they were enormous amount of wages that they dropped. They were willing to forgo half the

01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:55.060
profits and the ownership of the firm. So what the Chinese were doing wasn't just exploiting

01:41:55.060 --> 01:42:00.580
their labor force, it was also building a capitalist class. And that meant that you had

01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:05.380
this, that's where all the, you know, Chinese corporations have come from. So they were building

01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:11.780
a capitalist system within a socialist command political system. And that worked.

01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:16.580
And it's still working. So there was the centralization of the economic stuff,

01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:22.740
the gauss plan approach. I think that was where the Soviets failed. And what the

01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:27.460
Chinese realized after what they went through under Mao was you have to have that capitalist

01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:31.620
period, but they weren't going to abandon the communist control politically of the country at

01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:35.860
the same time. And that worked out brilliantly. And there's a huge amount of innovation taking

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:42.020
place in China today. And they also will do gigantic infrastructure projects, you know,

01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:46.980
breathtaking planning going into that. If you've, you would have seen videos of, you know, building

01:42:46.980 --> 01:42:52.980
a skyscraper in a day. The planning that has to go into that, the pre-preparation as necessary is

01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:57.620
enormous. So there's a real respect for engineers as well in that society, which does not apply in

01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:03.060
the West. What do you think about the, from the Western perspective, the destructive effects of

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:08.660
centralized control of the populace of the ideas of the discourse of the censorship and the

01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:13.780
surveillance, all those kinds of things? So it's a bit like we were talking about Russia to some

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:22.340
extent beforehand with centralized versus decentralized corruption. And when you had the

01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:29.140
centralized political stuff means, you know, you can't criticize within China, but so long as you

01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:34.100
don't criticize, you can do what you like. And how destructive is that to the human spirit?

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:42.100
From the American perspective, that feels destructive. I've been to China quite a few

01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:47.220
times over my life, a lot in the last, not for about four years, but the six years before that,

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:54.820
a few visits and staying in second and third and fourth tier cities. So, you know, populations of

01:43:54.820 --> 01:44:00.900
only 4 million people, which is quite small on Chinese standards. And I had a lot of happy

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:07.220
people that I was interacting with, my girlfriend at the time, her social circle. And like you can

01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:11.460
feel when people can't discuss a political issue, for example, in Thailand, you can't discuss the

01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:17.860
king. Okay. They still have, you know, less majest laws. So you can actually be jailed for

01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:24.020
discussing the king and you can feel that to some extent. And it's a political issue in Thailand now.

01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:30.740
But in China, what I got back from most people, it was a bit like a benevolent big brother. Okay.

01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:35.140
But then when you get things out like the lockdown, which has applied recently, then you get the

01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:42.980
failings of the Soviet system is still there in the Chinese system in that the easiest way to

01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:49.380
avoid criticism as an underling carrying out instructions of people above you is to carry

01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:55.220
those instructions out to the letter beyond what the people actually want you to do at the top.

01:44:55.940 --> 01:45:01.700
So we had a classic illustration of that. When I took these journalists, there was a news report

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:07.940
saying that China's output of light industry had grown by 17% in the previous year, but heavy

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:14.100
industry had fallen by 7%. And we just don't compute. So we kept on asking, why did this happen?

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:18.340
Every time we asked a question, this is back in 81, the answer would be the initial answer. We

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:23.940
followed the directive to the central committee, the communist party of China. We finally got a

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:28.180
guy to elaborate and say what that was. He said, well, the central committee sent out a directive

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:33.620
to promote light industry. So what did you do? Quote unquote, we stripped heavy industry

01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:40.580
factories and turned them into light industry. Now that's destructive of everything. And that's

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:45.140
the overlay that you've still got sitting over the top of China. But a huge part of the

01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:52.340
industrialization was simply saying, produce whatever you can, make goods, market them,

01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:59.140
sell them. And you get that innovative component of humanity is respected and the goods turn up

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:05.780
and everybody's well fed. Russia is far better than food in America. So in terms of material

01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:15.380
satisfaction and freedom, for example, enjoy dancing. I mean, we went to I think somewhere

01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:20.260
in Shanghai and there's this line of people involving a woman who would have been close

01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:26.740
to her 90s and a kid who was about six or four partying it up in the open air and doing this

01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:33.220
Chinese collective dance. You have to be really careful about that kind of thing. So in terms of

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:45.540
measuring the flourishing of a people by looking at their happiness, I have so many thoughts on

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:50.980
this, but I'm imagining North Korea. And if you talk to people in North Korea,

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:59.460
I think they would say they're happy. Well, let me try to complete this argument.

01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:07.620
Not an argument, but a sort of challenge to your thought, which especially in the bigger cities,

01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:15.220
because they don't know the alternative. So what else do you need? There's enough food on the

01:47:15.220 --> 01:47:24.820
table. We have a leader that loves us and we love him. Our hearts are full of love. Our table

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:34.420
is full of food, they would say, because it's enough food. What else do you want from life?

01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:41.380
I think that's an alternative. I've spent time in Romania.

01:47:41.380 --> 01:47:46.020
So let me sort of complete that, sorry, because I'm taking the most challenging.

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:54.100
When there's centralized control of information, you don't know the alternative. You don't know

01:47:54.100 --> 01:48:00.740
how green the grass is on the other side. And so your idea of happiness might be very constrained.

01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:04.740
So you could also argue that is happiness, if you don't know.

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:07.220
Ignorance is bliss.

01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:13.620
Ignorance is bliss. And then so is happiness really the correct measure for the flourishing?

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:20.980
It's not. But I mean, there's actually a classic book, a movie as well, called Mao's Last Dancer.

01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:27.140
And that is a young man explaining his progression from being a dancer in the

01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:32.340
Cultural Revolution through to a leading dancer in American and ultimately Australian ballet.

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:39.060
And he explicitly says at one point that he's told that the Chinese people have the highest

01:48:39.060 --> 01:48:43.780
standard of living in the world. And the reaction of him and his kids, like his fellow six-year-olds,

01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:48.500
is, God, it must be miserable elsewhere in the world then. So they knew.

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:49.300
They still know.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:54.420
They still know. There's no such thing as that complete ignorance. But what I'm talking about is

01:48:54.980 --> 01:49:02.820
in experiences in China, say back in about 2016, 2014, there was a feeling of freedom

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:08.180
within limits that you didn't want to transgress because the system was working.

01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:09.780
So if you-

01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:10.740
It's kind of like marriage.

01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:11.620
Pardon?

01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.580
It's kind of like marriage.

01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:13.700
Hey, that's a good example.

01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:15.460
There's limits.

01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:16.340
There's limits.

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:17.780
You can have fun within those limits.

01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:22.260
That's right. Okay. And people did have fun and they did feel free, but they didn't want

01:49:22.260 --> 01:49:29.380
to go and get divorced. But that dilemma was accommodated because the boundaries until you

01:49:29.380 --> 01:49:36.500
started hitting restrictions were wide. And when you look at it, again, with the Chinese

01:49:36.500 --> 01:49:43.220
Communist Party, the administrators of that are often highly qualified engineers who can then make

01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:48.340
intelligent decisions about what should be done as infrastructure and so on. And you go to China

01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:56.260
and you've got an incredible high speed rail, fantastic infrastructure, internet, telecommunications

01:49:56.260 --> 01:50:02.740
and so on, rapidly evolving solar. There's a range of things there that are so well done

01:50:03.300 --> 01:50:08.260
that reflect the fact that the selection process that gives you your political elite

01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:12.820
is partially focused upon sucking up, et cetera, et cetera. It's still there,

01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:18.980
but it's also focused upon your skill levels. And you get people making decisions who damn well

01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:23.940
know what they're talking about. Australia's got a classic example. The internet in Australia sucks.

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:31.460
The reason it sucks is that the Labour Party, which is our version of the Democrats,

01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:36.660
was in control during the global financial crisis. And as part of that, they wanted to bring in

01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:44.260
high optical fibre connections to the house. So you'd have an optical fibre backbone and an

01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:51.940
optical fibre right to your T100 output from your home. And the Liberal Party fought that and said,

01:50:51.940 --> 01:50:58.340
that's going to be too expensive. It'd take too long to do. We're going to do cable to the node

01:50:58.340 --> 01:51:03.300
and then have a copper network linking from a node on a street to all the houses in the street.

01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:07.620
It's going to be cheaper and faster, have it more soon, blah, blah, blah. It was a total

01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:13.620
technical fuck-up. And Australia now has internet that's about 50th or 60th fastest in the world.

01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:19.220
It's dreadful for the internet. Two political figures made the decision, Tony Abbott and

01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:27.620
Malcolm Turnbull, rivals and leaders of the Conservative Party we call Liberal over there.

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:34.500
Now, that was shitty decisions that wouldn't happen in a country like China because you've

01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:39.220
got actual engineers making the decisions. They say you can't get decent speed if you link

01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:46.500
optical fibre to copper. So what you get is even though you can't make the decisions yourself,

01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:52.100
a vast majority of the decisions are made intelligently and therefore you expect it.

01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:56.820
It's interesting, but don't you worry about the corrupting

01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:05.380
aspects of power? You have engineers making intelligent decisions, but at which point

01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:12.900
does the fat king start saying, oh, these engineers are annoying. I have good internet. I don't

01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:20.020
understand. Bring me the grapes. You get your colligular effects. That can happen. Like Zee,

01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:25.460
from what I've seen, has got elements of that. So friends of mine who are Caucasians can get

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:30.740
away with it. They have a game that they play at conferences, scoring how often people use Zee's

01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:35.540
name in a presentation and giving extra points for the number of photographs of Zee that turn up

01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:39.940
in the whole thing. So you've got this sort of personality cult coming along as well.

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:44.340
But at the same time, the planning for the infrastructure that's being built, the social

01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:52.100
services, the general freedom that exists is so great. And like any Chinese person alive today,

01:52:52.100 --> 01:53:02.180
like somebody as Chinese my age would have been an adult under the late period of Mao.

01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:05.860
And God almighty, the change, the improvement they've seen in their lives, that's what they

01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:12.100
think about. So- But if you just look at the history of the 20th century,

01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:17.540
your intuition would say that some of the mechanisms we see in China now will get you

01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:23.940
into trouble in the long term. So it seems to be working really well in many ways in terms of

01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:29.540
improving the quality of life of the average citizen in China. But you start to get worried

01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:34.500
about how does this go wrong? Well, yeah, but at the same time, maybe, I mean, often people will

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:38.980
say, what's your vision for the future? And what they mean is, what vision for the future do you

01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:44.660
have that I'm going to like? Right. Okay. Now, what if you have a vision of the future you don't

01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:51.780
like? It's dreadful. Well, that's the ecological crisis I think we're walking blindfolded into.

01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:58.740
Well, that's right. That part of the picture we'll have to talk about how fundamental of a

01:53:58.740 --> 01:54:02.340
problem that is. Okay. But what does that have to do with the future of China?

01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:06.900
What it has to do is that if you wish to impose dramatic controls on the consumption of the rich,

01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:13.540
which would be necessary to reduce our consumption burden so that we can get closer

01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:18.660
to the ecological envelope we've destroyed already, then you're going to make more

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:23.780
likely successful doing that with a centralized system where people accept centralized political

01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:28.020
control. Then you were in a country where it's all diversified and you scream freedom

01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:32.340
between every point in a tennis match. And I've literally seen that when I was in

01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:38.900
Philadelphia some time back. So the ideology that accepts a collectivist attitude

01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:44.020
may be more successful in controlling our reducing human consumption levels.

01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:52.340
Because when we talk about democracy, I mean, who's voting here? How many horses and elephants and

01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:57.860
birds get to vote? Okay. It's very- What's a bird?

01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:03.780
Yeah. You don't see them around here. It's a very human centric vision we have of this planet.

01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:06.740
Yeah. And we're going to pay a price for that.

01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:11.380
Okay. So you're saying to deal with global catastrophic events,

01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:16.420
centralized planning might be- I think will work better, period. I mean,

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:22.260
But there is some centralized stuff in the United States, for example.

01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:23.700
Oh, your military. Yeah, I know.

01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:32.180
Okay. All right. Now there's that feisty Australian. So besides the military,

01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.100
that's the ideal of the federal government in the United States is that

01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:40.980
there is some centralized infrastructure building. There's some big-

01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:43.620
There's not enough of it. But there's some.

01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:48.980
The question is, when you deal with greater and greater global catastrophic events,

01:55:49.860 --> 01:55:53.620
like the pandemic that we're just living through, that the government would be able to step up,

01:55:54.580 --> 01:56:01.300
and impose enough centralized planning to allow us to deal, sort of enable and empower

01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:05.940
the citizenry to deal with these catastrophic events. In the case of the pandemic, a lot of

01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:11.060
people argue that the, first of all, the world, but also the United States failed

01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:17.380
to effectively deal with the pandemic. On the medical side, on the social side,

01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:23.140
and on the financial side, the supply chain, everything. In terms of communication,

01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:31.540
in terms of inspiring the populace with the power of science on all fronts, they failed.

01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:36.580
But the ideal is that we'd be able to succeed. You would have to have a small, efficient,

01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:40.980
the ideal, the American ideal, is you have a small, efficient government that's able to

01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:44.980
take on tasks precisely like the pandemic. But the thing is, maybe it shouldn't have

01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:49.700
been as small as it was. I mean, my favorite instance of that actually involves the UK,

01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:55.060
because the whole neoliberal approach is about small, efficient government. Small, efficient

01:56:55.060 --> 01:56:59.940
government works when you face small, efficient challenges. When you face something systemic,

01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:06.740
rather than episodic, then it's going to break down. One of the things I greatly respect is

01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:11.700
Taleb's idea of anti-fragile. You want a society which is anti-fragile, not easily broken.

01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:16.180
Whereas neoliberalism has pushed us towards this vision of efficiency, but it's easily snapped.

01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:23.460
In the UK, I've forgotten the government minister involved, but she asked her expert committee,

01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:31.380
well before the pandemic, how many masks should we have on hand in case of a pandemic? The answer

01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:38.740
from the experts was about a billion. That's 50 masks. That's 20 masks per person. Oh, that's

01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:44.660
too many. Let's just make 50 million masks. That's one mask per person. It was gone in a

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:49.700
matter of a day. Therefore, that's why they told us, well, masks don't work. What they meant was,

01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:54.260
we don't have enough masks for our health people, let alone for you and the public.

01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:59.540
So we're going to bullshit you until those masks don't really work. Then people don't wear masks,

01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:03.620
and then we've got enough masks, we rush up the production job. By the time it comes along,

01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:09.700
people have got the skepticism about masks. Can you elaborate? Who does the blame in that case go

01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:13.060
on to? The blame comes down to the philosophy that says government should always be small.

01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:17.860
No, but do you really think that bigger government would be the solution to the

01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:24.020
mask issue? No. So let me push back. It's possible that capitalism solves that problem.

01:58:24.820 --> 01:58:29.700
Well, not if there's no money in really long-term planning and capitalism.

01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:39.300
Okay, there's money. Isn't it possible for capitalism to construct a system

01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:45.860
that ensures against catastrophic events? Not when they're systemic. You can ensure against

01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:51.940
episodic events. If you occasionally have a really bad storm, but in general, the weather's not so

01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:56.260
bad that all the infrastructure is being destroyed, then you can share that around on a percentage

01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:02.260
basis. If you have a Gaussian distribution for your events, and the mean doesn't move around

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:07.460
too much, and the standard deviation doesn't change all that much, then insurance works fine.

01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:12.900
But if that's episodic, if you have systemic stuff where the climate is changing completely,

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:19.300
and you're going to wipe out your agricultural capabilities, you simply can't do insurance on

01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:26.180
that front. You can't make a profit out of catastrophe and capitalism. Okay, so that example

01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:33.940
of climate change, let's talk about it. Okay. So you mentioned that the human brain,

01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:38.980
the economy, and the biosphere are three of the most complex systems we know.

01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:48.820
And you also criticized the economics community for looking at the effects of

01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:57.940
climate change when measured as the effect on the GDP. So you're saying it's a catastrophic

01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:05.140
thing that the biggest challenge our society, our world is facing. Why? If the economies disagree

02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:14.180
with you, the effects on the GDP will be minor, so we'll deal with it when it comes. That's the

02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:20.740
argument against, that's the devil's advocate. You're saying no, it is a thing that will change

02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:26.900
our world forever in ways that we should really, really, really be thinking about. Okay. Make the

02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:30.820
case the way you disagree with each other. The case is simple. Economists have made up their own

02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:37.620
numbers to say that it's trivial. And you didn't? No, I haven't even tried to make the numbers. I'm

02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:43.300
reading what the scientists write. Okay. Okay. And what the economists have done, and like this is

02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:48.420
William Nordhaus in particular, Nobel Prize winner, ex-president of the American Economic Association,

02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:54.340
literally assumed that a roof will protect you from climate change. He didn't say it in those

02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:59.700
words. What he said was, 87% of American industry occurs in carefully controlled environments,

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:04.500
which will not be subject to climate change. Now, the only things that all of manufacturing,

02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:11.300
all of services, he included mining as well, forgetting about open-cut mining, government

02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:15.620
activities and the finance sector. All they have in common is they happen beneath a roof.

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:21.860
So he's basically saying climate affects the weather, climate is weather. Okay. Now,

02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:28.580
that is not at all what is meant by climate change. It's meant changing the entire pattern

02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:34.340
of the weather system of the planet. For example, the most extreme form of climate

02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:39.540
change would be a breakdown in the three circulation cells that exist in each hemisphere.

02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:45.060
The Hadley cell, the Ferro cell, I think it's called, and the Polar cell, 0 to 30, 30 to 60,

02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:52.340
60 to 90. Those are the main bubbles, if you like, in the atmosphere. Now, if we get enough

02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:58.020
increase in the energy in the atmosphere, just like you turn the temperature up on a stove and

02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:02.260
you have nice bubbles occurring in a pot of soup and then turn the temperature up and they all

02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:07.300
break down and you've got bubbles everywhere, that's called the equable climate. If that happens,

02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:13.540
then most of the rainfall is going to occur between 0 and 20 and 70 and 90 and the middle

02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:21.940
is going to be dry, except for extreme storms. We built our societies in a period of extreme

02:02:21.940 --> 02:02:27.300
stability of the climate. And when you look at the long-term temperature records, it's up and down

02:02:28.500 --> 02:02:34.580
like a seesaw, like a sawtooth blade between, say, one degree warmer than now and four degrees

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:40.500
or six degrees cooler over the last million years. And when you look at where we evolved,

02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:45.860
it's just at a turning point on the peak of one of those ups and downs. I've forgotten the name

02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:52.180
of the cycles, but the cycles caused by changes in the earth's rotation around the sun. And so,

02:02:52.180 --> 02:03:00.180
we evolved our civilization just at the top. So, coming up from a cold period and then we're going

02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:04.660
to head down to another cold period and that's when human civilization came along. It's about

02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:10.580
a period of about 12,000 years. So, across that period, the temperature has changed by not much

02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:16.100
more than half a degree up and down. Now, we're blasting it well and truly out of those confines.

02:03:16.660 --> 02:03:23.620
And my way of interpreting what climate change means is the stability of that climate that

02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:29.460
enables to build sedentary civilizations and not be a nomadic species is being destroyed.

02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:34.980
So, the challenge, and by the way, I'm playing devil's advocate.

02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:42.420
The question is, is there something fundamentally different now about human civilization that we're

02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:51.700
able to build technology that alleviates some of the destructive effects that we have on the

02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:57.540
climate? We don't know. We're going to find out the hard way. And the uncertainty you think

02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:01.540
will be very costly. Extremely. Like many of the trajectories we might take

02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:08.740
will be much more costly than they're profitable. Yeah. And like we've seen some of the storms that

02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:13.860
are happening now in Europe, the ones that washed away a village in Germany some time ago,

02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:18.020
the firestorm that hit Canada of all places, I've forgotten the name of the town that was burnt

02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:23.300
down, but enormous temperatures in Canada. Again, the storms that have been happening back in

02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:28.180
Australia, these are all manifestations of a complete shift in the weather patterns of the

02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:35.060
planet. And they can wipe out, like a village just disappears, just wiped out by unprecedented

02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:42.180
rains. And this keeps on happening. We are still living in a sedentary lifestyle when we're a

02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:48.980
nomadic species. So, to be able to maintain that sedentary lifestyle, we do need to engineer the

02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:56.580
planet. We need to keep it within that range of plus half a degree Celsius minus half a degree,

02:04:56.580 --> 02:05:01.540
which is really what it's been like for the last 10, 12,000 years. Instead, we're blasting it right

02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:08.340
out of that range. And we know some of the past climates that have existed then. We can model

02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:14.100
what they imply for our food production systems, for example. Not the only example, but obviously

02:05:14.100 --> 02:05:19.780
crucial. So, when you look at what are called global climate models produced by scientists,

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:27.300
one of the examples, and it was published by the OECD last year, 2021, in the chapter on what

02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:32.980
will happen if we lose what's called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC,

02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:37.140
and people would colloquially know that as a Gulf Stream. And that's what distributes heat

02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:43.460
around all the oceans of the planet. It's part of a huge chain called the thermohaline circulation.

02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:49.700
But the part that goes across from the equator to the North Atlantic, that's called the AMOC and

02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:57.140
Gulf Stream colloquially. If that disappears in the context of a two and a half degree Celsius

02:05:57.140 --> 02:06:03.620
increase in average global temperature, then the proportion of the Earth's surface, which is suitable

02:06:03.620 --> 02:06:11.860
for producing wheat, will fall from 20% to 7%. Proportion for corn, similar sort of fall. The

02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:17.460
proportion suitable for rice will go from 2% to 3%. Now, that means a catastrophic, and that's the

02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:23.460
word used in the report, catastrophic collapse in food production. So, that's what we're toying with.

02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:29.780
And we are one and a half, we're actually less than, we're about halfway there to that 2 degrees,

02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:39.700
2.5. And economists on the other hand, and this is Richard Toll, published a paper in 2016,

02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:44.180
claiming using what he calls an integrated assessment model that economists developed,

02:06:44.820 --> 02:06:52.900
that losing the Gulf Stream would increase global GDP by 1.1%. Now, his model, this is what really

02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:57.380
pisses me off about these people. It's the worst work I've read in 50 years of being a critic of

02:06:57.380 --> 02:07:05.140
neoclassical economics. The GCMs, the one scientists produce, of course include precipitation as well

02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:10.420
as temperature. The IAMs that the economists produce, and this is stated yet again in a paper

02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:18.500
in 2021, do not include precipitation. They simply have temperature. So, they assume that

02:07:18.500 --> 02:07:22.740
if temperature improves by moving towards a temperature which is better for producing

02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:28.820
aquaculture, okay, then so will precipitation. Now, that's completely wrong. They've left out

02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:32.660
a crucial, imagine trying to model the climate while ignoring the fact that there's rainfall.

02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:37.780
That's what they've done. So, their work is so bad, so dreadfully bad,

02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:41.940
it should never have been published. I'm going to go for them, sorry.

02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:47.620
Well, no, no, 100% as they deserve it. So, it's an oversimplification,

02:07:47.620 --> 02:07:53.220
but I also want you to steel man people you disagree with and criticize people you agree with,

02:07:53.220 --> 02:07:59.700
if possible, to be sort of intellectually honest here. You do say, sort of to push back on the

02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:10.340
catastrophic thinking about climate change, that the ecology, the biosphere is a complex system.

02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:14.660
Economics, the economy is a complex system.

02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:23.940
So, how can we make predictions about complex systems? How can we make a hope of

02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:29.940
having a semi-confident predictions about the complex system? So, the scientific community

02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:39.860
is very confident about the complex system that is a biosphere and the crisis that's before us

02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:47.780
on the horizon. And then the economists are, as a community, I don't know what percentage, but

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:52.500
too much. That part of the community

02:08:52.500 --> 02:09:02.020
is very confident looking at the economics complex system in saying that, no, this

02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:09.940
system we have of labor, money, and capital, and so on, we'll be able to deal with that crisis and

02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:15.700
any other crisis. And they kind of construct simplified models that justify

02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:20.660
their confidence. So, how do we know who to believe?

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:25.540
For a start, if you believe the economists, you need to break your head red.

02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.380
Because it's not an argument.

02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:29.540
No, it's not an argument. It's a summary of an argument.

02:09:29.540 --> 02:09:30.260
And that is-

02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:32.820
No, that sounds a lot like an opinion and an emotional-

02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:34.820
I know, I know, because I'm so angry about it.

02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:41.940
Listen, I'll tell you where I stand. And I've begun looking, studying the climate change

02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:52.580
much more. I used to be on things I don't understand, have not spent time on. I have

02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:59.220
so many colleagues that are scientists that I deeply respect. And I trust their opinion.

02:10:00.180 --> 02:10:10.980
I have seen the lesser angels of my colleagues on the pandemic side, on the COVID side,

02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:20.020
the confidence, the arrogance, that in part blinded, I believe, the jump between basic

02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:31.060
scientific research to public policy. So, I've become a little bit more cautious in my trust

02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:36.260
on climate change. I'm still in the same place. And I don't mean climate change.

02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:45.940
Anything scientists say, I've become a little bit, wait a minute. How does the basic scientific

02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:51.940
facts of our reality map to what we should do as a human civilization? There, I want to be a

02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:57.300
little bit careful. So, whenever now I see arrogance and confidence, I become suspicious.

02:10:57.300 --> 02:11:01.220
Well, I'm the same. And that's why I'm being angry about the economists, because there's

02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:07.860
incredible arrogance, incredible stupidity at the arrogance, assumptions which

02:11:08.820 --> 02:11:12.020
you look at it and think, how did anybody let that get published?

02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:18.900
Sure. The economic analysis of the effects of climate change are poor, in many cases.

02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:23.780
Incredibly poor. And this is like when Bjorn Lomborg styles himself as the

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:29.860
skeptical environmentalist and criticizes the environmental models. He doesn't take a look,

02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:34.340
he doesn't criticize the work come out by economists. You look at it, it's so bad.

02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:40.180
Is it possible to do good economics modeling of the effects of climate change?

02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:42.580
Yeah, it is possible. Very difficult.

02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:45.860
Or is it like one complex system stack?

02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:51.300
It's two, in that case, yeah. I mean, like to me, what you should be looking at is saying,

02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:55.380
what are the scientists saying are the consequences, probable consequences, not

02:11:55.380 --> 02:12:02.020
guaranteed, but probable consequences of increasing the energy level of the atmosphere

02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:03.220
by the amount we're doing.

02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:08.340
What can the scientists say in terms of like the effects, because it's so complicated, the effects

02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:15.780
of sort of shifting resources. So basically, what are the effects of climate change? How can

02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:20.660
we really model that? Because it's basically, you're looking through the fog of uncertainty.

02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:20.980
Yeah.

02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:25.940
Because there are rising sea levels. How can we know what effect that has?

02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:26.340
Well, yeah.

02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:28.420
How do we know there'll be a lot of change?

02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:34.420
Yeah. I think the sea level one is a poor argument, and I don't focus on it. What I

02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:40.180
mainly focus upon is the weather patterns. Okay. And if you look at, like we got the

02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:46.180
wheat belt in America goes through what? Idaho and countries, places like that. And you've got an

02:12:46.180 --> 02:12:51.300
incredibly deep topsoil. Ukraine is another classic example, the depth of the topsoil in

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:57.780
Ukraine is remarkable. And that's the wheat bowl of Europe. And that requires both the right

02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:01.700
temperature for growing wheat and the right rainfall for growing wheat. Now, when you look

02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:07.780
at the models that climate scientists are building of that, you have pretty much,

02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:14.740
your ultimate foundation is the Lorenz model of turbulent flow. And of course, that's the first

02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:20.900
model in which we saw chaos theory, complexity. That beautiful, simple model, three variables,

02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:27.300
three parameters, an incredible complexity out of the system. And what that meant was,

02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:33.300
you also had an exponential decay in the accuracy of your model over time. So if you have,

02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:40.180
if you accurate to a thousand decimal places, then in a thousand days, you'll have no data

02:13:40.180 --> 02:13:44.820
whatsoever because each time you're losing an order of magnitude of accuracy. Okay. So that's

02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:49.700
the point about the inability to predict for the very long future. But what you can just say,

02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:54.820
well, there's a prediction horizon. If we're close enough to the, if our statistical measurement of

02:13:54.820 --> 02:14:00.820
where we are is close enough to where we actually are, and our forecast horizon is narrow enough

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:06.020
to not extrapolate too far, then for this prediction and forward, we can make a reasonable

02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:10.260
fist at predicting what the weather's going to be. And that's the foundation of meteorological,

02:14:11.140 --> 02:14:16.020
the stuff we watch on TV. You know, most of the time, the forecasts are going to be correct

02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:22.180
these days. 40, 50 years ago, most of the time, the forecasts were wrong. So that's the background

02:14:22.180 --> 02:14:27.620
foundation to these GCMs. But even they've got to massively simplify the world. So you have this

02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:32.580
enormous sphere of where they might divide it down to a hundred kilometer by a hundred kilometer by

02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:41.140
10 kilometer, you know, cube, rectangles, whatever oblongs. That's how they're modeling

02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:48.580
the transition of where they're from one location to another. So they've got a chunky vision of the

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:52.740
planet, which they have to, they can't model it now down to the last molecule. So you're losing

02:14:52.740 --> 02:14:56.660
that, right? It's getting better and better and better and better. Oh, yeah. I think that's just

02:14:56.660 --> 02:15:01.860
too much processing power. But you're going to have some confines. You can't go, I mean, if you look

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:06.260
at the models to do the weather, they used to be of that 100 kilometer, I think are about 10 kilometer

02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:11.380
grids now. I don't know. But so the processing powers let us get more and more precise that way.

02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:17.060
I do know that the models now include chemical mixing that occurs above cities. They've added

02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:21.380
that complexity to them over time. So you're looking at the increasingly accurate models,

02:15:21.380 --> 02:15:26.740
the weather patterns, the effect they have on agriculture, on food. And you're saying that

02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:33.060
there's a lot of possibilities in which that's going to be really destructive to society on the

02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:36.660
food production side. And if you have that increase in temperature, they're going to get a change in

02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:42.500
precipitation. And it could mean that where the rainfall and the sunshine are adequate for growing

02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:47.780
wheat is an area where there's no topsoil. It's like a huge part of the models, the models the

02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:53.060
economists use, which only use temperature, don't include precipitation. They predict that a large

02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:58.820
amount of the wheat or the wheat output of the world is going to occur in Siberia in the frozen

02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:06.100
tundra. So that's a straightforward criticism of oversimplified models. What about the idea

02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:17.060
that we innovate our way out of it? So there's a silly, poor example at this time perhaps,

02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:29.380
but lab-grown meat, sort of engineered food. So a completely shifting source of food for

02:16:29.380 --> 02:16:32.900
civilization. So therefore alleviating some of the pressure on agriculture.

02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:39.380
That comes down to the difference that Elon makes between producing a prototype and mass producing

02:16:40.020 --> 02:16:45.780
the prototype. You can develop the idea very rapidly to put that into production

02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:49.220
on the scale that's necessary to replace what we're currently doing.

02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:49.940
Six years.

02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:54.500
Yeah. And we haven't got years. We might have decades. We certainly haven't got centuries.

02:16:55.860 --> 02:17:02.020
So in the timeframe we've got, I can't see that engineering going from prototype to production

02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:07.700
levels to replace what we're currently doing in the stable environment we're currently destroying.

02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:12.260
What do you think about the sort of the catastrophic predictions that people that

02:17:12.260 --> 02:17:16.500
have thought, have written about climate, have made in the past that haven't come to...

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:21.220
That's mainly unfortunately involving Paul Ehrlich and the population bomb

02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:22.740
and the predictions Paul was making.

02:17:22.740 --> 02:17:25.300
A few individuals or the one individual in that case.

02:17:25.300 --> 02:17:25.620
Yeah.

02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:29.780
So I'm mostly playing devil's advocate in this conversation and enjoying doing so.

02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:37.300
So I do think I'm in agreement with the majority of the scientific community.

02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:39.700
But you still see that argument made.

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:45.060
I still see the argument made. And I also am a little bit worried about the arrogance

02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:47.220
and the ineffectiveness of the arrogance.

02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:53.220
This is the problem. It's ineffective. And that's what worries me because it's all been

02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:59.620
been put into this sort of sea level rise, temperature changes.

02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:07.300
It's not put into the fragility of the system in which we currently live.

02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:11.620
And the earth will survive. And there's a wonderful science fiction book called

02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:15.540
The Earth Abides about a world in which humans get wiped out.

02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:18.980
There's only a tiny little band left and then the earth reasserts itself.

02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:22.180
So the earth's going to survive us. Will we survive what we do to the earth?

02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:31.460
That's the question. And my feeling is that we have underplayed the extent to which

02:18:31.460 --> 02:18:35.460
the civilizations were built have depended upon a relatively stable climate.

02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:41.460
And there's that turning point in the global average temperature that we evolved right in

02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:46.260
the top of it. And if we had done nothing, we could find that heading back down towards

02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:50.820
another ice age could equally destroy the possibility of sedentary life.

02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:54.660
For example, if we'd never developed fossil fuel-based industries,

02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:59.940
we'd never built super phosphate. So our population would never have reached

02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:06.420
one billion people. And we were still living like fairly sophisticated animals, but like 17th

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:11.700
century level of load on the planet, then we would have gone down that decline.

02:19:11.700 --> 02:19:16.820
And the approaching ice age would have started to wipe out our farming areas.

02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:20.260
The glaciers would have encroached and we would have been driven out of

02:19:20.260 --> 02:19:23.780
like an agricultural sedentary civilization by that change.

02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:30.180
So it's just the fact that we evolved on this stable period in the overall temperature cycle

02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:35.940
of the planet. And that stability is something which just reflects the turning point in the

02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:39.780
regular cycle of Malachowicz cycle, I think it's called. I've forgotten the actual name,

02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:44.580
but it's the cycle caused by change in the earth's orbit around the sun,

02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:52.580
reflectivity and so on. That cycle, it's just that tiny top bit that we evolved in.

02:19:53.140 --> 02:19:56.820
So what we should have done, so that's really useful for us, we should stay at that level.

02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:01.620
Now, if we hadn't done it, we'd go back down here and that'd be the end of our civilization by an

02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:08.500
ice age. Instead, we're going up here really rapidly. And we're causing a change in temperature

02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:13.620
compared to that long-term cycle, 100,000 times faster.

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:21.380
Yeah, I mean, my biggest worry is even subtle changes in climate

02:20:22.260 --> 02:20:28.660
might result in geopolitical pressures that then lead to nuclear war.

02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:31.940
And that's, yeah, I mean, there's an argument that's actually behind,

02:20:32.580 --> 02:20:38.100
to some extent, not the Ukraine war so much, but the Arab Spring, the wars in Syria,

02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:40.740
which partially has led to what's happening in Ukraine.

02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:45.460
And our weapons are getting more and more powerful and more and more destructive. More

02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:52.420
and more nations are having these destructive weapons. And now we're entering cyber space

02:20:52.420 --> 02:20:56.420
where it's even easier to be destructive. Hyperbaric weapons, which didn't exist in

02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:02.580
the Second World War. So you don't need nuclear weapons to have catastrophic attacks on each

02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:07.380
other. So yeah, it's incredibly scary that the warlike side of human nature

02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:13.700
could be extremely enhanced by climate breakdown.

02:21:14.420 --> 02:21:21.940
So in this world, on a happy note, I don't know how we went from Marxism and Stalinism to

02:21:22.740 --> 02:21:29.860
ecology, but all those are beautiful complex systems. What is the best form of government,

02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:38.580
would you say? We talked about the economics of things. You ran for office, so you care about

02:21:38.580 --> 02:21:43.540
politics too. How can politics, what political systems can help us here?

02:21:43.540 --> 02:21:49.940
I think we first of all have to appreciate we're one species on our planet out of millions. And

02:21:50.580 --> 02:21:58.180
as the intelligent species, we should be enabling a harmonious life for those other species as well.

02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:04.900
Can we actually linger on that? You mentioned that we need to acknowledge the value of life on Earth.

02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:16.980
Can we integrate the labor theory of value? Can we integrate into that the value of life?

02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:19.620
So there's human life.

02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:24.980
If you take that structure that I talked about of Marx's

02:22:24.980 --> 02:22:30.740
use value, exchange value, dialectic, the foreground, background, that only exists,

02:22:30.740 --> 02:22:34.100
that only works because we're exploiting the free energy we find in the universe.

02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:41.860
There could be no production system without free energy, which is the first law of thermodynamics.

02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:46.500
There is free lunch, after all, and it's grounded in the energy that's provided to us.

02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:48.820
Well, yeah, that's the free lunch. That's what we're exploiting.

02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:50.420
It's the only free lunch we get.

02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:53.460
You know Ginsburg's summary of the laws of thermodynamics, don't you?

02:22:54.020 --> 02:22:59.700
Alan Ginsburg said the laws of thermodynamics are summarized. A, you can't win.

02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:02.980
B, you can't break even.

02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:05.620
C, you can't leave the game.

02:23:07.300 --> 02:23:08.100
Nice, yeah.

02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:08.900
Beautiful summary.

02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:13.060
But the fact that it exists in the first place is the free lunch.

02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:18.820
So we're exploiting the free lunch, but to be able to do it, we can't put waste back into that

02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:22.580
system so much that it undermines the free lunch. And that's what we've been doing.

02:23:23.300 --> 02:23:30.420
And once you respect the fact that we have to, living on the biosphere the planet we're actually

02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:37.700
on, we have to enable that biosphere to survive us. Because if it doesn't survive us, we won't

02:23:37.700 --> 02:23:43.140
survive it disappearing. And there's not that realization in humanity in general.

02:23:43.140 --> 02:23:49.620
And when you say the value of life, you know, all the different living organisms on Earth are part

02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:56.820
of that biosphere. So in order to maintain the biosphere, we have to respect, like,

02:23:57.380 --> 02:24:01.460
pragmatically speaking, what that means is actually respecting all of life on Earth,

02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:02.340
even the mosquitoes?

02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:04.980
I've got some, no.

02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:12.420
Parasites, I mean, we are a parasite. When you look at it, we're the mosquitoes of the

02:24:14.260 --> 02:24:18.580
large organizations. If you're a fan of the Matrix movies at all?

02:24:18.580 --> 02:24:19.060
Sure.

02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:21.220
Okay. Look what I'm wearing.

02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:23.540
Absolutely. I was wondering what the inspiration was.

02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:30.660
We are living in a simulation. And I have a conversation offline to have with you about that.

02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:34.100
You've been misbehaving and we're going to have to put you back in line.

02:24:34.100 --> 02:24:39.300
So what's Agent Smith says when he's got Morpheus in his possession? He said,

02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:43.300
I've been trying to classify your species. I've decided you're a virus.

02:24:44.260 --> 02:24:48.020
Okay. Now there's truth to that. We have intruded into everything.

02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:54.340
Okay. We've taken over every element of the biosphere. And we think we can continue doing

02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:59.540
that. And the thing is, we're breaking that. We're exploiting it so much, we're breaking it down.

02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:05.460
And I think it's E.O. Wilson who argued the 50% rule. He believed that we should reserve

02:25:05.460 --> 02:25:12.420
50% of the planet for non-human species. In other words, we make 50% of it off limits.

02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:19.620
Humans cannot go there. And we just let that evolve as it does. And then we control the other 50%.

02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:25.940
I think he's probably giving too much to us. I think we should actually save like 20%, 25% max.

02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:30.020
And the rest of the planet, we let life go on and evolve as it does

02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:37.940
without our interference, without our dominance. Now, that's neither a democratically democratic

02:25:37.940 --> 02:25:42.980
system nor an authoritarian one. It's one which starts off with saying the first thing humans have

02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:51.140
to do is respect life itself. Okay. So would we do that? We haven't done it, obviously.

02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:55.780
I don't think the Soviets would have done it if we had a generally Soviet system.

02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:02.500
We haven't done it under a capitalist. We continue intruding. So I think we have to go through

02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:08.340
something like a Star Trek catastrophic 200 years to realize that ultimately if we're going

02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:15.220
to survive as a species, we have to respect life in general. And then that means parts of the planet

02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:20.740
we can no longer touch while we also try to maintain the planet at the temperature that

02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:28.420
we found in what we now call the Anthropocene. Okay. So politically, we have to have,

02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:34.740
like in many ways what native societies often have, a vision of the cycle of life,

02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:41.780
not this exponential progression we've developed over the last 250 years. And again,

02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:46.420
I'll use another movie, the Avatar type respect for the cycle of life. We need to have that as

02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:53.540
part of our innate nature. And then on top of that, the political system comes out. Now,

02:26:54.020 --> 02:27:01.300
that political system has to be one that lets us feel like we have a say in the direction of

02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:07.460
society while that part is sacrosanct. Okay. We can't touch it, but we also, because we are

02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:12.500
now living with so many challenges created by our own civilization. I mean, the main threat

02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:17.380
to the existence of human civilization is the existence of human civilization.

02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:19.220
Is both a feature and a bug.

02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:24.340
Yeah. And therefore, we need to have people who can understand complex systems making those

02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:30.100
decisions. Now, that means it isn't a political system as much as it is an appreciation that

02:27:30.100 --> 02:27:35.780
the world is a complex system. And therefore, effects, which we think are direct effects,

02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:42.340
will actually come through in a bleak fashion. And we cannot, there's no simple linear progression

02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:46.660
from where we are to where we want to be. So you have to see how everything feeds together

02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:50.500
in a systemic way. And that's why, one reason I designed the software I'm wearing the T-shirt

02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:56.980
for now, Minsky, is to have, it's nowhere near to this scale. I hope it one day will be,

02:27:56.980 --> 02:28:01.060
but something which means we can bring together all that complexity, all those systems and perceive

02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:05.780
them on an enormous screen where we have all the various interests and we can see what are

02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:12.820
potential futures. And that then guides us. So it isn't a case of democracy and, you know,

02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:18.500
our side wins the vote and therefore we ban abortion or we don't, you know, whatever else

02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:25.140
happens. It's seeing what the, respecting the fact that we're in a complex system and being

02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:34.900
uncertain about the consequences and not making the bold expansionary ideas that we've been doing.

02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:41.860
So like being a little bit more humble.

02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:44.420
Humble. Humble is a good word.

02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:51.860
But wouldn't you like to apply that same humility both to the considerations of

02:28:53.940 --> 02:29:00.740
the prose of capitalism and to the catastrophic view of the effects of climate change?

02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:06.740
Yeah. And also like I think we can afford to be bold in space. And that's one reason I respect

02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:13.140
the practical vision of Musk and the so far impractical vision of Bezos, that if we're going,

02:29:13.140 --> 02:29:18.420
we look for the very far future, the only way we can continue expanding our knowledge of the

02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:24.340
universe is to move our civilization, the productive side, off the planet.

02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:25.620
Off-site backup.

02:29:25.620 --> 02:29:26.420
Yeah.

02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:30.740
So can you actually linger on this? So let's actually talk about this. So first of all,

02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:38.260
you have the new book, humbly named, The New Economics, A Manifesto.

02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:40.020
Publisher chose the title.

02:29:40.020 --> 02:29:47.700
Yes. No, but I'm joking, but maybe I will ask you about why manifesto, but we'll go through some of

02:29:47.700 --> 02:29:54.660
the ideas in this book. We have been already. So some of it is embracing the fact that the economy,

02:29:55.460 --> 02:30:00.740
our world, our mind is a complex system. So this t-shirt that you're wearing.

02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:01.540
Yep. Take it out.

02:30:03.380 --> 02:30:03.940
Turn it around.

02:30:03.940 --> 02:30:04.580
It's a software.

02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:07.460
I'll do that. Do you like this?

02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:09.540
There you go. You're wearing the whole-

02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:10.580
Okay, look, that's what he's talking about.

02:30:10.580 --> 02:30:15.220
Is this an infomercial? So there's a t-shirt that says Minsky,

02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:21.940
after, not my Minsky, it's your Minsky.

02:30:21.940 --> 02:30:25.220
Not Hyman. So Hyman Minsky, not Marvin Minsky.

02:30:25.220 --> 02:30:35.140
Not Marvin Minsky, right. So AI Minsky is Marin and then Harmon, it all rhymes. So Stability is

02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:44.100
free open source system dynamic software invented by Mr. Steve Kean,

02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:51.940
coded by Russell Standish. It's on SourceForge. It's destabilizing.

02:30:51.940 --> 02:30:53.620
Stability is destabilizing.

02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:57.940
So that's sort of embracing the complex aspect of it.

02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:03.620
How can you model the economy? What are some of the interesting,

02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:10.420
whether detailed or high level, big picture ideas behind your efforts with Minsky?

02:31:10.420 --> 02:31:11.220
Okay, Minsky-

02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:16.500
Meaning the software, the modeling software that models the dynamic system-

02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:22.100
Basically, what Minsky is doing is system dynamics modeling. So if anybody's used Stella

02:31:22.100 --> 02:31:28.100
or Vensim or Simulink, then they've used exactly the same family of software that Minsky is part

02:31:28.100 --> 02:31:32.900
of. So I didn't invent that. That was invented by Jay Forrester, who's one of the great intellects,

02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:39.540
one of the great engineers in American history. And the idea of Forrester's system was

02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:48.020
complex interactions. So he was doing his work in the 50s. If people don't know Forrester's work,

02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:54.420
he actually built the models of the mathematics for the gun turrets on American warships in the

02:31:54.420 --> 02:32:00.580
Second World War mechanical systems, obviously. So he had to work out how to give a feedback

02:32:00.580 --> 02:32:05.220
system that meant when the boat rolled in one direction, the turret did not roll the other way.

02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:09.620
All that stuff was his work. So marvelous engineering. And then he realized if you want

02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:15.140
to look at it, even like a factory, a factory is a complex system. And so you get cycles generated

02:32:15.140 --> 02:32:20.180
out of the interaction between different components of the factory that he was first involved in

02:32:20.180 --> 02:32:24.580
taming, that he built the software to model complex interactive systems. So Minsky is that,

02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:28.740
the thing that Minsky adds, which is unique is the Godley table. And that's the double entry

02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:32.980
bookkeeping. So you can model the financial system. Godley, the economist. Godley, the economist,

02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:40.260
another great, great man. So there's like this, you're modeling it as like a state diagram.

02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:44.740
Yeah, fundamentally. It's actually circuit diagrams. It's exactly what engineers have been

02:32:44.740 --> 02:32:51.300
using for decades, almost a century. So you're using a circuit diagram to model the economy.

02:32:52.020 --> 02:32:58.660
And that's the, so other factories have done it. What they haven't had in the circuit diagram

02:32:58.740 --> 02:33:04.660
is a way of handling the dynamics of the financial system. So what the Godley table does is bring it

02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:10.260
financial flows as being everything goes from somewhere and ends up somewhere.

02:33:11.140 --> 02:33:14.980
So you have a positive and a negative. If you're looking on the liability side,

02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:19.780
a positive and a positive or negative and a negative, you're looking at assets and

02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:24.180
liability side and Minsky gets the accounting right for that. So you can do an enormous complex

02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:29.220
model, looking at the economy financially from the point of view of a dozen different actors

02:33:29.220 --> 02:33:33.540
in the economy and know that the mathematics is right, even though what you're building is

02:33:33.540 --> 02:33:39.780
a set of differential equations, which might be 50 differential equations with 350 terms in them.

02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:43.300
If you've got the Godley tables right, you know the mathematics is correct.

02:33:43.300 --> 02:33:47.300
So that's the main innovation that Minsky adds. And you're operating there at the

02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:52.500
macroeconomics level. Yeah, it's definitely macro. It's top down. It's not agent based.

02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:58.420
I'm just opening on a random page that I think is very relevant here. The process, this is referring

02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:03.380
to Minsky, not the software, maybe the software. I don't know. The process can be captured in an

02:34:03.380 --> 02:34:08.420
extremely simple causal chain. Capital determines output, output determines employment. The rate of

02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:13.540
employment determines the rate of change of wages. Output minus wages and interest payments determines

02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:19.060
profit. The profit rate determines the... There's a very nice circuit here. The profit rate determines

02:34:19.060 --> 02:34:24.500
the level of investment, which is the change in capital, which takes us back to the beginning

02:34:24.500 --> 02:34:30.820
of this causal chain. And the difference between investment and profits determines the change

02:34:30.820 --> 02:34:37.300
in private debt. And there's some nice, the Keene-Minsky model and the intermittent route

02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:42.420
to chaos on page 86 of your book. Do these come from the software?

02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:48.580
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I first did that in Mathematica back in 1992, August 1992.

02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:51.940
Mathematica is another amazing piece of software.

02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:56.260
Yeah. I find it's very much a programmer's approach to mathematics. I prefer like a program

02:34:56.260 --> 02:35:01.620
called MathCAD, which is what I'm using for all my... When I do my mathematics on the

02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:05.220
computer, I write on MathCAD. C-A-D or CAB?

02:35:05.220 --> 02:35:11.380
C-A-D. It's been ruined by bad management. They chucked out all the good engineers and

02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:13.700
I'm still using a version which is 12 years old.

02:35:13.700 --> 02:35:15.620
If only engineers ruled the world.

02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:19.700
If only engineers, rather than this particular case, there was a bunch of

02:35:19.700 --> 02:35:23.700
marketers for CAD software agreed. I'm definitely a fan of engineers.

02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:28.100
What are the plots that we're looking at here? Growth rate, private debt ratio,

02:35:28.100 --> 02:35:34.020
employment versus wages, employment versus debt, income distribution. So this is across years,

02:35:34.020 --> 02:35:38.340
like different trade-offs. Is there something interesting to say about the plots and the

02:35:38.420 --> 02:35:41.540
insights from those plots that are generated by the software?

02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:48.180
Yeah. That's a particular parameter values to give that outcome. But what happened when I first

02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:51.780
simulated the model, I took a model by a guy called Richard Goodwin, who's one of the great

02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:58.260
neglected economists, American Marxist, mathematical Marxist. And what he did was build a model of

02:35:58.260 --> 02:36:06.180
cycles. And he actually wrote a paper called... It's only about a five-page paper published in

02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:11.380
a book and a very, very obscure conference paper. And what he was doing was trying to build a model

02:36:11.380 --> 02:36:19.540
of Marx. Okay? So he wrote it in 1967 and it was putting in a mathematical form a model that Marx

02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:26.180
came up with in 1867. So it was a centenary birthday present to Marx. And what Marx had argued

02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:37.700
in chapter 25, I think, of volume one of capital, section three, he built a verbal model of a

02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:42.420
cyclical system. And it's quite out of character with the rest of the book. So when you read volume

02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:48.660
one of capital, people think Marx has got a commodity money view of money. He doesn't at all.

02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:53.300
He simply did... The idea was he had like an onion. You start off on the middle level and you

02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:57.140
ignore the outer layer. Then you bring the outer layer and so on and so forth. Anyway, in this

02:36:57.140 --> 02:37:01.860
model, in volume one of capital, he normally just assumed workers got a subsistence wage.

02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:10.340
That's it. But in this little chapter, he said that if the economy is booming,

02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:16.020
then workers will demand wage rises. Okay? And the wage rises will cut into the profit

02:37:16.580 --> 02:37:20.820
so that capitalists will not get the level of profit they're expecting. Therefore, they will

02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:26.740
invest less and the economy will slump. And the slump will mean workers become unemployed

02:37:26.740 --> 02:37:31.940
and have to accept wage cuts. And it was a model of a cyclical economy. And as it happens, Marx

02:37:31.940 --> 02:37:37.460
spent his later years trying to learn enough calculus to be able to model it himself mathematically.

02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:42.020
And he never managed. There's Marx's mathematical notes on calculus, which are quite fun to read.

02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:47.220
And if you have a mathematical background... Did he get far? No, he got too caught up in the

02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:53.380
whole philosophy. He never really got to build the model. But what Goodman realized was a predator

02:37:53.380 --> 02:37:58.820
prey model. Okay? The Locter-Volterra model was the basis of the idea. So the idea is you have a

02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:08.420
prey. And the example that Locter actually used initially was grass. Grass is the prey.

02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:13.940
And then you have a predator and the predator were cows. So you start off with a very few cows,

02:38:13.940 --> 02:38:19.780
lots of grass. And then because of lots of grass, the numbers of cows grow. And then because the

02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:24.340
cows grow, they start to eat the grass. So the grass runs out. So the cows starve and you get

02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:29.780
a cycle. And what Locter was amazed by was that the cycles were persistent. They didn't die out.

02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:35.060
So Goodman got that vision and he then built a predator prey model. And I first of all read

02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:40.100
Goodman and really found it really hard to follow his writing. He's not a very good writer. But a

02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:44.740
guy called John Blatt, who was a professor of mathematics at New South Wales University,

02:38:44.740 --> 02:38:49.940
wrote a brilliant explanation of Goodman's model in a book called Dynamic Economic Systems. And I

02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:54.420
read that. It was superb. And he said a way you could extend this was to include finance.

02:38:55.620 --> 02:39:00.740
So I thought, okay, what I'm going to have is that what Goodman presumed is capitalists invest

02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:07.380
all their profits. Okay? So you get boom when there's a high rate of profit because they

02:39:07.380 --> 02:39:12.020
invest all that money. And then a slump when there's low profit because depreciation will

02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:16.580
wipe away capital and you'll go boom and slump. So I simply added in, well, capitalists will

02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:22.660
invest more than their profits during a boom, but less than their profits during a slump.

02:39:23.460 --> 02:39:28.020
And that therefore means they had to borrow money to finance the gap and pay interest on the debt.

02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:33.220
So I ended up with a model with just three system states. The income share, the distribution of

02:39:33.220 --> 02:39:38.900
income between workers, capitalists and bankers, the level of employment and the level of private

02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:45.700
debt. And those three equations are fundamentally like going from the L'Octo Volterra model with

02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:50.900
just two equations and therefore you get a fixed cycle to the Lorenz model where you have three.

02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:54.980
And therefore what I got out of it was a chaotic outcome. So what you're seeing is a

02:39:55.780 --> 02:40:02.580
manifestation of chaos, complexity in those plots. But the fascinating, one of the many fascinating

02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:09.940
parts about it was that as the level of private debt rose, in my model I had capitalists being

02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:14.740
the only ones who borrowed, but the people who paid for the high level of private debt were the workers.

02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:22.180
The rising bankers share corresponded exactly to a falling workers share.

02:40:23.060 --> 02:40:26.260
So you can infer from that that the workers are the ones paying?

02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:29.940
Effectively, the workers end up paying for it. They get a lower level of wages.

02:40:30.500 --> 02:40:35.780
The basic dynamic is that capitalists, when you have a three social class system,

02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:39.780
your income goes between workers, capitalists and bankers. Now in the system, the good one did,

02:40:39.780 --> 02:40:44.340
they're just workers and capitalists. So if workers share rose, profit capital share had to fall.

02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:49.460
But when you have three social classes, then capital share can remain constant while workers

02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:57.140
falls and bankers rise. So that's what actually happened. Because capitalists, the simple way I

02:40:57.140 --> 02:41:01.780
modeled it was there's a certain rate of profit at which capitalists invest all their profits.

02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:06.900
Above that, they borrow more. Below that, they pay off debt. So what would happen is when you got

02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:13.620
back to that point, then the level of investment would be a precise share of GDP. And therefore,

02:41:13.620 --> 02:41:18.180
you'd get a precise rate of economic growth. But if there was a higher percentage going to

02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:22.820
bankers and offset by a lower share going to workers, it didn't affect the capitalists.

02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:31.940
So what you get is the cycles diminish for a while because the income distribution effect

02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:38.180
is important. So the workers pay for the increasing level of debt. But the other side of it was that

02:41:38.180 --> 02:41:43.220
the cycles would diminish for a while. Now what you get is a period of diminishing cycles,

02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:47.540
then leading to rising cycles. And technically, this is known as the

02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:55.540
Pommer-Manneville route to chaos. And it's one particular element of Lorenz's equations

02:41:55.540 --> 02:42:02.180
and fluid dynamics. So what they found was in examining laminar flow in a fluid,

02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:06.900
you have a period where the laminar flow got more laminar, and then suddenly it'll start to get

02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:13.540
less laminar and go turbulent. And this is what actually goes on in the model. So in my model of

02:42:13.540 --> 02:42:19.540
Minsky. So what you have is a period where there's big berms and cycles. And then as the

02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:25.780
debt level rises, the berms and slums get smaller. And that looks like what neoclassical economists

02:42:25.780 --> 02:42:31.860
call the great moderation. So when I first modeled this in 1982, I finished up my paper,

02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:37.380
which is published in 95, but what I thought was a nice rhetorical flourish, saying the chaotic

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:42.020
dynamics of this paper should warn us against regarding a period of relative stability in a

02:42:42.020 --> 02:42:46.900
capitalist economy as anything more than a lull before the storm. Now, I thought it was a great

02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:51.300
speed of rhetoric. I didn't think it was going to fucking happen. But it did because you had this

02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:57.380
period from 1990 through to 2007, where there were diminishing cycles. And the neoclassicals

02:42:57.380 --> 02:43:01.700
labeled that the great moderation, and they took the credit for it. They thought that the economy

02:43:01.700 --> 02:43:07.780
was being managed by them to a lower rate of inflation, a lower level of unemployment,

02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:11.540
less instability over time, and they literally took credit for it.

02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:15.220
And I was watching that and thinking, that's like my model running. And I'm scared as shit

02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:21.220
that there'll be a breakdown. I ended up not working in the area for a while because I wrote

02:43:21.220 --> 02:43:27.380
debunking economics. And I got involved in a fight over the modeling of competition

02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:30.340
in neoclassical theory. That took me away for about four or five years.

02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:40.660
And then I got asked to do a court case in 2005, end of 2005. And I used Minsky as my framework

02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:45.380
for arguing that somebody who was involved in predatory lending should be able to get out of

02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:52.100
the debt they were in. And I explained Minsky's theory. And I used this throwaway line as saying,

02:43:52.100 --> 02:43:56.740
debt levels in private debt have been rising exponentially. And then I thought, well, I can't

02:43:57.300 --> 02:44:00.260
as an expert just make a claim like that. I've got to check the data.

02:44:01.140 --> 02:44:05.540
And the debt ratio was rising exponentially. And I thought, holy shit, we're in for a financial

02:44:05.540 --> 02:44:10.100
crisis. And somebody has to warn about it. At least in Australia, I was that somebody.

02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:16.900
So can you, given this chaotic dynamics idea, can you talk about the crisis ahead of us in the

02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:22.420
future? So one of the things, I mean, it's a fundamental question of economics. Is economics

02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:30.820
about understanding the past or predicting the future? Because you can construct models that

02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:41.540
do poetic, like in 95 poetic conclusion. Yeah. And then you can watch years fly by and some of the

02:44:41.540 --> 02:44:49.460
predictions in retrospect that you make turn out to be true. But all kinds of gurus throughout

02:44:49.460 --> 02:44:54.500
history have done that kind of thing. And you can call yourself right and forget all the many

02:44:54.500 --> 02:45:00.100
times you've been wrong. Let's talk about the future. What kind of stuff, you mentioned about

02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:07.460
the importance of the biosphere, but what other crises are ahead of us that a chaotic dynamics

02:45:07.460 --> 02:45:14.100
view allows us to predict? What really I saw coming out of it, leaving aside the ecological,

02:45:14.660 --> 02:45:20.900
wasn't a crisis. It was stagnation because what we got out of the crisis was caused by a rising

02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:28.180
level of private debt. Now you reach a peak level where the willingness to take on debt collapses.

02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:34.500
And so you go to a period where debt is rising all the time. So credit, which is the annual

02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:40.660
change in debt, and credit is part of aggregate demand and aggregate income. So credit goes from

02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:46.660
positive to negative, and that causes a slump. So can you describe why that causes a slump?

02:45:49.220 --> 02:45:52.740
If you ask Paul Krugman, he'll tell you credit plays no role in aggregate demand.

02:45:54.260 --> 02:45:58.500
Give me a second. Credit plays no role in aggregate demand.

02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:02.980
So the vision that the neoclassicals have of the banking system is what they call learnable funds.

02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:10.420
It's Paul Krugman, by the way, the knight at the front of the army that is the neoclassical

02:46:10.420 --> 02:46:17.620
economist. Yeah, fundamentally. He's politically reasonable, which makes him

02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:24.260
more dangerous than those that aren't. There's quite a lot of people that would disagree with

02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:28.660
that characterization of Paul Krugman as he's politically reasonable. You should see the

02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:34.500
people behind him. The alternatives. Fair enough. That's not a negative or positive statement.

02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:38.660
That's just he can be feisty as well. Oh, he can. He can. But he's like the human

02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:44.260
face of neoclassical economics. It doesn't deserve having a human face. It's an anti-human

02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:52.180
theory. That's what you really think. I got you. All right. So the credit does not have any effect

02:46:52.180 --> 02:46:54.820
on aggregate demand. In their model.

02:46:54.820 --> 02:46:58.900
And you're saying that's not the case at all. It's absolutely crucial to aggregate demand. So

02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:04.500
what they model is, again, the example of you lending to me or vice versa. If I lend money to

02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:12.740
you, I can spend less. You can spend more. So credit is the change in debt. So if I lend money

02:47:12.740 --> 02:47:19.300
to you, then there's a level of private debt rises. So there's an increase in credit, but that

02:47:19.300 --> 02:47:24.020
increase in credit comes at an expense of my spending power. So you can spend what I've lent

02:47:24.020 --> 02:47:29.060
you, but I can't spend what I've lent you. So credit cancels out. But when you look at,

02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:33.300
that's loanable funds. But in the real world, and the Bank of England has said this is the real

02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:41.620
world, and the textbooks are wrong, categorically in 2014, when the bank lends, it adds to its asset

02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:46.420
side and says, you owe us more money. And it adds to its liability side and says, here's the money

02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:51.860
in your bank account. Now you spend that money. So what happens when you do your sums, credit is

02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:57.780
part of aggregate demand and aggregate income. And that's something I first solved in 2019,

02:47:57.780 --> 02:48:03.700
I think, 2000. I only recently proved it mathematically. So what that means is credit

02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:10.580
is a component of aggregate demand, and credit is also very volatile. So consumption demand never

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:15.140
goes negative. Investment demand never goes negative. But credit can go from positive to

02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:20.740
negative. And when you take a look at the long run of American history after the Second World War,

02:48:21.300 --> 02:48:28.420
there was no period until 2007 where credit was negative. It was a positive component of

02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:34.420
your positive number. And therefore, when you do it as a percentage of GDP, it was a positive

02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:47.220
percentage of GDP. It peaked at 16% of GDP in 2006, 2007. It fell to minus 5% in 2008, 2009.

02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:53.620
So you had a 20% of GDP turn around in aggregate demand. Now, when you plot that against

02:48:53.620 --> 02:49:03.220
unemployment, the correlation of credit to unemployment across the period from about 1990

02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:11.700
to 2010 is about minus 0.9. Enormous negative correlation. Now, according to the Neoclassicals,

02:49:11.780 --> 02:49:17.300
it could be sloshed to zero. Empirically, it's bleedingly obvious it's not, and it applies to

02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:24.020
every country in the world that had a financial crisis at that period. So it's bleedingly obvious

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:28.580
in the data, and they ignore it because credit's not part of their model. And you're saying it's

02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:39.620
causation. It is causal. Today we sit there is extremely high inflation. What role does

02:49:39.620 --> 02:49:44.900
inflation play in this picture? Is a little bit of inflation good? We talked about money creation

02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:52.180
at the beginning. What's a little bit of inflation good or bad? A lot of inflation good or bad? How

02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:57.140
concerned are you about- A little bit is good for a simple reason. Again, it's taken me a while to

02:49:57.140 --> 02:50:01.220
get my head around this. But if you think about how people say, what are the functions of money?

02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:05.940
They say money, it's a unit of account. So you're measuring. It's a means of exchange,

02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:14.180
and it's a store of value. Now, yes, okay, it has those three roles, but the last one is contradictory

02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:20.180
to the previous two. And this is where you see this with the Bitcoin phenomenon. If you want to

02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:28.500
hang onto money as a store of value, then if prices are falling, the value of money is rising.

02:50:29.460 --> 02:50:35.700
And it's actually in your interests as a store of value to hang onto it and not spend it. So that

02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:41.380
contradicts its role as a means of exchange. Now, if you have money which depreciates,

02:50:41.380 --> 02:50:47.300
and this was actually tried in the Austrian town of Wargall during the Great Depression,

02:50:48.180 --> 02:50:53.060
if you have money that depreciates, then if you don't use it, you lose it fundamentally.

02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:58.900
So it has a high rate of circulation. So there's a monetary theorist called Silvio Gazelle,

02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:06.260
and he wrote this proposal that money should depreciate. And he was ridiculed and opposed

02:51:06.260 --> 02:51:11.540
and derided, but Cain said he was a great intellect. And the mayor of town of Wargall

02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:18.340
in Austria during the Great Depression was facing an unemployment rate of 25% pretty much.

02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:23.540
Germany had the worst experience in the Great Depression in the world, as bad as America,

02:51:23.540 --> 02:51:28.260
slightly worse than America. And so he thought, how can I stimulate demand here?

02:51:28.340 --> 02:51:32.500
So he produced a script which could only be used for buying goods and services in Wargall

02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:39.780
and could be used to pay your local rates. But it was depreciated by putting a stamp on the money

02:51:39.780 --> 02:51:45.060
if you didn't use it. So what happened was people would pay their rates, they needed to pay the

02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:51.060
rates using this money, so the script, so they used the script. And because it depreciated,

02:51:51.060 --> 02:51:57.460
you'd use it rapidly. So people were using that money, this alternative to the Austrian Schilling,

02:51:57.460 --> 02:52:01.220
and the economic activity in town took off, and unemployment fell to zero.

02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:06.020
And it was an absolute miracle, and everybody loved a Wargall experiment, and the Austrian

02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:10.740
Central Bank sued them for establishing an alternative form of money and shut it down.

02:52:11.540 --> 02:52:20.660
Unemployment went back up to 25% again, and Austria voted 99.6% for the Nazis, something crazy

02:52:20.660 --> 02:52:26.580
number like that when Hitler marched in. So the Wargall experiment showed that a depreciating

02:52:26.580 --> 02:52:32.340
currency led to a high rate of circulation. But of course, we're not talking Weimar Republic levels

02:52:32.340 --> 02:52:37.300
of inflation. So when you get that much inflation, and that's normally caused by,

02:52:38.740 --> 02:52:43.700
as the Weimar inflation was caused by, the reparation terms imposed on Germany,

02:52:44.260 --> 02:52:50.180
fundamentally by France at the Treaty of Versailles, they paid a large part of that with

02:52:50.180 --> 02:52:54.660
just basically printing the notes. And you went into this crazy period of hyperinflation.

02:52:54.660 --> 02:52:59.380
So hyperinflation almost always occurs when there's a massive destruction of physical resources,

02:52:59.380 --> 02:53:03.780
and the monetary authority tries to paper literally over it, and then you get hyperinflation,

02:53:03.780 --> 02:53:11.540
that's total social breakdown. So a moderate level of inflation inspires the means of exchange usage

02:53:11.540 --> 02:53:19.860
of money, but undermines the store of value usage of money. And that dilemma is why we have this

02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:22.740
antagonistic attitude towards inflation.

02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:31.060
Yeah, I mean, you're describing as a tension, but it's nevertheless is like money is a store

02:53:31.060 --> 02:53:36.580
of value and a means of exchange. And I don't, you know, to push back, it's not necessarily

02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:42.580
that there's a tension, it's just that depending on the dynamics of this beautiful economic system

02:53:42.580 --> 02:53:49.700
of ours, it's used as one more than the other. If there's inflation, you're using it more for the

02:53:50.660 --> 02:53:55.700
means of exchange, it's deflation using more for store value, but that doesn't,

02:53:55.700 --> 02:54:01.300
I don't see there's a tension, that's just a how much you use it for those different, like-

02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:07.620
But it ends up saying that overall, the level of effective commerce, a bit of inflation is a good

02:54:07.620 --> 02:54:11.300
thing, because that's depreciating the money slightly and encourage its use.

02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:17.380
Yeah, but so the argument that Bitcoin folks use or gold standard folks-

02:54:17.460 --> 02:54:17.960
Yeah.

02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:28.260
Again, HODL is not an argument. That having an inflation of zero is actually achieving that

02:54:28.260 --> 02:54:35.140
balance. So like, yeah- But they're actually in favor of negative, they wanted to appreciate

02:54:35.140 --> 02:54:42.660
rapidly, and there's a negative inflation, the value of the money rising relative to commodities,

02:54:42.660 --> 02:54:44.980
that's what they want. That's the HODL philosophy.

02:54:44.980 --> 02:54:50.900
Well, that's more of like an investment, I don't know if that's more of investment philosophy than

02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:57.940
the fundamental principles of why they believe in cryptocurrency, in forced scarcity is the model.

02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:04.020
The concern there is that when you print money, the public policy is detached from the actual

02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:11.620
value. Yeah, well, I mean, this is where again, it matters to get money creation right,

02:55:11.620 --> 02:55:15.940
because the government's not the only money creator, banks are as well, private banks.

02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:24.740
If we obsess too much about limiting government money creation, what we end up getting,

02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:29.300
if there is money creation going on, it's private banks doing it, and you get an increase in private

02:55:29.300 --> 02:55:37.700
debt, and fundamentally, private debt and its collapse of credit, when it stops growing,

02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:39.940
that's the fundamental cause of financial crises.

02:55:40.980 --> 02:55:45.380
So- Yeah, but the question is, what's the cause for the collapse of the-

02:55:46.740 --> 02:55:52.340
Well, I think this is like the Austrian thinking leaves out the debt deflation, and that's like,

02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:56.820
I think one of the most important papers ever written was by Irving Fischer, called The Debt

02:55:56.820 --> 02:56:02.420
Deflation Theory of Great Depressions. Fischer was somebody who accepted the neoclassical vision,

02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:13.140
he wrote the pre-efficiency market hypothesis, he had his own PhD called The Theory of Interest,

02:56:14.420 --> 02:56:20.100
and in that he argued effectively for supply and demand analysis of the financial system,

02:56:21.460 --> 02:56:27.140
and he argued for equilibrium. He said, when you're working with a commodity market,

02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:33.620
then the sale and the transaction and the exchange occur at the same point in time.

02:56:34.740 --> 02:56:38.580
When you're working with the financial market, then the exchange occurs through time.

02:56:39.300 --> 02:56:46.580
So he said he assumed that debts are repaid, all debts are repaid, and he assumed that

02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:51.700
equilibrium through time was an essential part of his assumption, and then the great depression

02:56:51.700 --> 02:57:00.900
comes along, and he has become a major shareholder in Rank Xerox because he invented the Rolodex,

02:57:01.940 --> 02:57:09.060
he's a tinkerer, and so he had taken out shares on margin, and he was worth about 100 million

02:57:09.060 --> 02:57:14.740
in modern terms when the great depression hit, and 90% of that was share market valuation,

02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:19.460
he'd taken out margin debt just like everybody else, and with margin debt you could put down

02:57:19.460 --> 02:57:26.100
$100,000 and buy a million dollars worth of shares. So he got this huge leverage into debt.

02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:30.900
Now when the financial crisis hit, the level of margin debt in America had risen from

02:57:31.460 --> 02:57:40.660
half a percent of GDP in 1920 to 13% of GDP in 1929. It then fell to zero again. That's why the

02:57:40.660 --> 02:57:46.740
stock market crash in 1929 was so devastating, that scale of margin lending, and everybody was

02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:51.300
being wiped out, they were selling Rolls Royces for 20 quid. You literally have photographs showing

02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:55.220
people doing that because a margin call comes in, you've got to liquidate everything.

02:57:56.260 --> 02:58:02.740
So he said the danger of a debt deflation is what we have to avoid, and that means

02:58:03.700 --> 02:58:08.900
you don't want too much private debt to accumulate, and you don't want falling prices,

02:58:08.900 --> 02:58:13.780
because the falling prices will amplify the impact of being insolvent to begin with,

02:58:14.420 --> 02:58:19.460
and that's what we saw in the Great Depression. It's partially what we saw in 2007,

02:58:19.460 --> 02:58:24.660
but we didn't have anything like the level of margin debt. Margin debt was reduced from 90%

02:58:24.660 --> 02:58:32.100
to 50% ratio after the Great Depression, so there were limits on how bad it was in 2007,

02:58:32.900 --> 02:58:40.420
but the danger is still the period of deflation amplifies your debts. I call it Fischer's paradox,

02:58:40.420 --> 02:58:44.580
he didn't write those terms himself, but he wrote a line saying the more debtors pay,

02:58:44.580 --> 02:58:51.540
the more they owe, and this is because you're liquidating to try to meet your own debts.

02:58:52.100 --> 02:58:58.180
When you liquidate, the price level falls, you will end up having a lower level of monetary debt,

02:58:58.180 --> 02:59:02.100
but a higher level of debt when you deflate it using the price level.

02:59:02.100 --> 02:59:07.220
So the biggest danger in capitalism is the debt deflation, far more dangerous than inflation.

02:59:07.780 --> 02:59:09.940
And the cause of debt deflation is?

02:59:10.820 --> 02:59:14.180
Too much lending, too much bank lending, too much private money creation.

02:59:14.980 --> 02:59:20.980
And if you take a look at the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge explained the boom of the 1920s

02:59:20.980 --> 02:59:26.980
on his surplus. He said, my government running a surplus of 1% of GDP, pretty much from 1922

02:59:26.980 --> 02:59:32.100
through to 1930, is the foundation of our stability. It should be continued. What he

02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:37.940
didn't look at was that over that same time period, on average, Americans were borrowing

02:59:37.940 --> 02:59:44.020
5% of GDP per year from the private banks. So you had a housing bubble at the beginning of

02:59:44.020 --> 02:59:50.500
the 1920s, which Richard Vague covers beautifully in the brief history of doom. And then you had

02:59:50.500 --> 02:59:56.660
this huge rise in margin debt as well, gigantic increase in margin debt. So all this borrowed

02:59:56.660 --> 03:00:00.740
money was being spent into the economy, and this is where credit becomes part of aggregate demand,

03:00:00.740 --> 03:00:05.460
and it's both not just for goods and services, it's also for shares and houses and so on.

03:00:05.460 --> 03:00:11.140
So a huge valuation effect. But then when the margin debt turned around,

03:00:11.140 --> 03:00:15.860
when people would not take out margin debt anymore, the demand for margin debt disappeared,

03:00:15.860 --> 03:00:21.860
and then it was what we call badly a positive feedback loop. It's actually an amplifying

03:00:21.860 --> 03:00:28.020
feedback loop, and that caused a collapse. So what elements of that do you see today

03:00:28.020 --> 03:00:33.060
that we need to fix, and how do we fix it? We have to regard the level of private debt as a

03:00:33.060 --> 03:00:37.540
target of economic policy, just as much as the rate of inflation or the rate of unemployment.

03:00:38.420 --> 03:00:41.300
What is the moderate amount of private debt? That's good.

03:00:41.300 --> 03:00:45.140
I would say something of anywhere between 30 and 70% of GDP.

03:00:45.940 --> 03:00:48.900
What is it currently? In America, it's 170%.

03:00:49.860 --> 03:00:52.180
Nice. Of GDP.

03:00:52.180 --> 03:00:53.860
Of GDP. Oh, that's nice.

03:00:53.860 --> 03:01:00.740
I've got... After we talk, but I can show you the data in this, and it is just this huge increase

03:01:00.740 --> 03:01:08.820
in private debt that first of all caused the boom, but then financing the credit ultimately causes

03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:15.700
the slump. And so if we remove the rate level at which debt can reach, and we stop speculative

03:01:15.700 --> 03:01:23.140
lending and base have a lending for both innovation, investment, and essential consumption items,

03:01:23.140 --> 03:01:27.700
we won't have the slump on the other side. We can get rid of financial instability. We can't

03:01:27.700 --> 03:01:32.820
stop financial cycles, but we can stop financial breakdown. So we should really be focusing on the

03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:35.140
instability and getting that under control. Yeah.

03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:40.900
By the way, as you point to your laptop, my laptops, I have a lot of... How many computers

03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:45.940
do I have? A lot of them, but my little Surface, whatever the heck this thing is, is getting

03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:49.860
definite size envy because your laptop you said is 18 something inches.

03:01:49.860 --> 03:01:50.980
18.4 inches.

03:01:50.980 --> 03:01:58.500
18.4 inches. I don't think I've ever seen one that big, and I'll give the internet that one.

03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:04.020
All right. That's for the graphics. So it's a gaming laptop. It's basically a desktop.

03:02:04.820 --> 03:02:06.660
It probably weighs like 40 pounds.

03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:09.140
8 kilos?

03:02:09.860 --> 03:02:10.420
8 kilos.

03:02:10.420 --> 03:02:11.940
Let's see if you recognize it, Alton.

03:02:11.940 --> 03:02:12.980
Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah.

03:02:12.980 --> 03:02:13.620
Okay. Yeah.

03:02:13.620 --> 03:02:16.020
8 kilos, that's, you know, you're pushing 20 pounds.

03:02:16.020 --> 03:02:19.060
You've seen the power supply for it? It's over there somewhere. The power supply

03:02:19.060 --> 03:02:20.740
weighs about twice as much as your laptop.

03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:23.460
Yeah. And you have to power it on with a crank.

03:02:23.460 --> 03:02:23.940
Pretty close.

03:02:23.940 --> 03:02:27.220
You have to like pull it. Is it gas powered or is it coal or...

03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:30.180
Oh, well, it's probably a nuclear power station inside there.

03:02:30.180 --> 03:02:30.500
Nuclear, yeah.

03:02:30.500 --> 03:02:32.340
And a nuclear diamond in the back there.

03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:40.100
Okay. So let me, before I forget, just let me ask you about... We've covered brilliantly

03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:45.940
the nuance disagreements you have and the wisdom you've drawn from Karl Marx,

03:02:45.940 --> 03:02:49.940
but there's also, like you mentioned in popular discourse,

03:02:52.740 --> 03:02:57.780
a kind of a distorted use of different terms and one of them is Marxism today.

03:02:57.780 --> 03:03:05.540
Is there something you could just speak to about, you know, increased use of that word

03:03:05.540 --> 03:03:09.540
and is it misused? Does it concern you that there's a lot of actually young people that

03:03:09.540 --> 03:03:15.380
say they're sort of proudly Marxist? Are they misusing the term?

03:03:15.380 --> 03:03:17.940
They are definitely misusing the term if they don't understand

03:03:18.660 --> 03:03:25.540
the use value, exchange value dialectic I went through earlier and they don't.

03:03:25.540 --> 03:03:32.900
If I could just pause, the idea of socialism and Marxism is used in sort of popular lingo.

03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:40.100
It's basically, you know, a lot of people have a disproportionately hard life.

03:03:40.660 --> 03:03:46.100
Why can't we help them out? Why can't we be kind to our fellow man?

03:03:47.540 --> 03:03:52.980
That's a short embodiment of an idea as opposed to some super complicated,

03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:57.540
elaborate model of the economy and politics.

03:03:57.540 --> 03:04:02.580
Yeah. I mean, we could do that by using the insights that come out of modern monetary theory,

03:04:02.580 --> 03:04:05.940
which I've confirmed just using my simple Minsky models.

03:04:05.940 --> 03:04:09.380
And that is that to use the term usually a feature, not a bug,

03:04:09.940 --> 03:04:13.700
a government running a deficit is a feature of a well-functioning,

03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:19.140
mixed fiat credit economy, not a bug. The government should normally run a deficit

03:04:19.140 --> 03:04:21.380
because that's how the government creates money.

03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:25.860
Now, because we've had this obsession from mainstream economists of running a surplus,

03:04:25.860 --> 03:04:30.500
which is what caused the Great Depression, Calvin Cool is doing it for eight years,

03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:34.500
because of that obsession, we've cut back on social services, we've cut back on health,

03:04:34.500 --> 03:04:37.460
we've cut back on education, we've cut back on infrastructure.

03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:41.860
Now, all that stuff predominantly affects the poor because the rich can afford to buy it themselves.

03:04:42.420 --> 03:04:46.420
So if we had a son of which realized that the government should run a deficit,

03:04:46.420 --> 03:04:49.380
it's a feature, not a bug, of a fiat money system.

03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:52.820
And that's where Elon's made one mistake recently,

03:04:52.820 --> 03:04:55.220
by not going back to founded first principles.

03:04:55.220 --> 03:05:01.940
That deficit enables you to provide enough of a decent standard of living for those who don't

03:05:01.940 --> 03:05:07.700
come out on top in the capitalist game. And with that, you wouldn't have the angst of the

03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:14.100
young people. Now, we still have the climate parameters within which we have to survive,

03:05:14.100 --> 03:05:18.100
but a decent level of government funding would mean the angst that you get when people say,

03:05:18.100 --> 03:05:22.500
I want to be a Marxist, and they've got what I call a cardboard cutout version of Marx in

03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:28.980
their minds, that wouldn't be happening. So it's potential to have a good society,

03:05:28.980 --> 03:05:34.740
where the government runs a deficit that finances the needs of the poor, where the rich get enough to

03:05:35.540 --> 03:05:41.780
indulge and take care of themselves. And you don't get this breakdown. If you try to cause

03:05:41.780 --> 03:05:46.580
the government running a surplus, then the burden of that is borne by the poor, middle class and

03:05:46.580 --> 03:05:49.060
poor. And that will lead to the angst we're now seeing.

03:05:52.060 --> 03:05:54.900
Beautiful. That was a beautiful

03:05:56.180 --> 03:06:01.060
whirlwind exploration of all of economics and economics history. Let me ask you, you tweeted,

03:06:01.060 --> 03:06:09.780
I think, we are the opposite of ants, individually intelligent, collectively stupid. We need to

03:06:09.780 --> 03:06:18.980
develop systems thinking fast to counter our limitations. That's really interesting. Do you

03:06:18.980 --> 03:06:25.140
really believe we're individually intelligent and collectively stupid? I do. Can you elaborate on,

03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:30.740
I mean, some of that is just cheeky tweets. It's a cheeky tweet I've had from my mind for a long

03:06:30.740 --> 03:06:35.380
time. It's one that actually went moderately viral, not enough, but moderately viral for me.

03:06:36.340 --> 03:06:40.820
But nevertheless, if you could analyze it as if it's some deep, profound statement you made in

03:06:40.820 --> 03:06:46.020
a book. Well, the reason is that we are incredibly individually intelligent. Things like these

03:06:46.020 --> 03:06:50.740
devices we're playing with now. That's the creation of individual minds. Creative individual mind and

03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:55.140
a collective labor over centuries that led to this level of technology. And that has to be

03:06:55.140 --> 03:07:01.780
respected. It's incredible stuff. But at the same time, I think what humans are, if you want to

03:07:01.780 --> 03:07:07.540
distinguish humans from other species on the planet, we don't weave webs. We don't make bird

03:07:07.540 --> 03:07:16.580
calls. What we do is we share beliefs. You don't think that's a catalyst for intelligence?

03:07:16.580 --> 03:07:21.540
Yeah, it is a catalyst. But what it means is we can dilute ourselves as much as we can inform

03:07:21.540 --> 03:07:28.020
ourselves. So because we share beliefs, we can do things in a collective way. And if we believe

03:07:28.980 --> 03:07:33.940
if we take the incantations of the witch doctors and we happen to have a couple of spears and

03:07:34.500 --> 03:07:41.300
things, we can go and attack the local herd, the tribe of lions and drive them out,

03:07:41.300 --> 03:07:47.140
and we become the dominant species. So it worked at the stage where we were in competition with

03:07:47.140 --> 03:07:52.820
other species on the planet. Now that we're the dominant species, then our beliefs get in the way.

03:07:53.620 --> 03:08:00.580
So you agree with Einstein who said there are only two things that are infinite, the universe

03:08:00.580 --> 03:08:06.340
and human stupidity. And he wasn't sure about the universe. Right. That's right. He wasn't

03:08:06.340 --> 03:08:13.780
sure about the universe. Yeah. So you think that the collective, I mean, there's an infinity to

03:08:13.780 --> 03:08:19.940
the destructive and the stupid, the inhumane that's possible when we humans get together. But it feels

03:08:19.940 --> 03:08:25.460
like there's more trajectories. There's more possibility for creation. There are. And I think

03:08:25.460 --> 03:08:32.340
that's why we have to, I say, if we were built around the idea that our role as a species is to

03:08:32.340 --> 03:08:39.060
maintain and extend life on the planet, and if not find it elsewhere, then seed it elsewhere,

03:08:39.700 --> 03:08:44.980
then that is a vision which makes us creative and confines the worst elements of our capacities

03:08:45.060 --> 03:08:51.300
to share beliefs. So that's what my hope is that we'll reach that stage. But I think we've

03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:58.340
overshot it so badly that my real fear is we'll end up blaming technology for the type of world

03:08:58.340 --> 03:09:03.300
we find ourselves living in in the next 20 to 50 years. So you think technology is going to be one

03:09:03.300 --> 03:09:09.460
of the, part of the solution? Part of the solution. Yeah. But if we go through and blame it,

03:09:09.460 --> 03:09:14.580
which is quite possible, we'll blame the technology rather than blaming too much of the technology and

03:09:14.580 --> 03:09:18.580
the too much comes down to what economists have told us, that we can just continue consuming

03:09:19.140 --> 03:09:23.700
infinitely on a finite planet. And Kenneth Boulding said that beautifully. He said if

03:09:23.700 --> 03:09:27.300
somebody believes that they can have exponential growth on a finite planet,

03:09:27.300 --> 03:09:34.900
they're either mad or they're an economist. So you made a long journey for which I'm deeply honored

03:09:34.900 --> 03:09:42.820
from... Sydney? This distant place. Antipodes. There's myth. You've got to go there one day.

03:09:42.820 --> 03:09:48.020
You'd enjoy it. I will. I'm afraid if I go there, I will stay forever. And so...

03:09:48.020 --> 03:09:52.180
No, it's a bit too... There's more vitality back in this economy. So you'd come back.

03:09:52.900 --> 03:09:58.820
Okay. Maybe. You know, I'm not a fan of the economy or money or any of that nature

03:10:00.180 --> 03:10:06.500
calls me. So I'm honored that you make that trip. You've also said that while you're here in Austin,

03:10:06.500 --> 03:10:16.260
you're going to go to this American factory that makes cars here in Austin and also visit

03:10:16.260 --> 03:10:23.220
Starbase. So let me ask you about expanding out into the universe. Is that something that

03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:31.140
excites you? You mentioned about the economics of it. What do you think Marx would think about

03:10:31.140 --> 03:10:36.020
this? Economically speaking, what is this? Is it a good thing?

03:10:38.180 --> 03:10:43.300
We can have capitalism in outer space far more successfully than we can have it on the planet

03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:46.900
because we don't face... When we dump the waste, it ends up in the sun. Not a problem.

03:10:48.820 --> 03:10:54.660
So it means the potential... We don't undermine our own productive capacity if we're doing it

03:10:54.660 --> 03:11:00.020
in outer space. So the destructive element of waste has a lesser impact in outer space.

03:11:00.020 --> 03:11:04.260
Yeah. I mean, who cares if we throw a bit of our iron back into the sun again? It'd take a fair

03:11:04.260 --> 03:11:09.060
bit of it to turn it into a... What would be the next stage? It'd be a red giant. And we have to

03:11:09.060 --> 03:11:13.460
get away because if there's a red giant at some stage, the sun will head out past the orbit of

03:11:13.460 --> 03:11:22.020
Mars, I think. Certainly past the orbit of Earth. So to have longevity of not just human life,

03:11:22.580 --> 03:11:28.260
the life that evolved on this planet, we have to be able to take it off planet ultimately. So if

03:11:28.260 --> 03:11:33.620
you think in the really long term, then it's our responsibility, we're going to want to maintain

03:11:33.620 --> 03:11:42.580
life, is to establish life off the planet. What do you think about robots and AI as part of the

03:11:42.580 --> 03:11:48.980
expanding out into the... Oh yeah, we have to. I mean, that ends labor. You can't go for... Your

03:11:48.980 --> 03:11:53.300
daily joint can't be from here to the asteroid belt and back again for dinner with your family.

03:11:54.020 --> 03:11:58.580
So production would be entirely mechanized. There'd have to be a handful of people who

03:11:58.580 --> 03:12:02.500
service the machines, but... So it's about production and automation. What about

03:12:03.780 --> 03:12:09.060
elements of consciousness that make humans so special? What about that persisting within

03:12:09.060 --> 03:12:13.060
the machine? That, I mean, I'm still a skeptic about us ever being able to create a machine

03:12:13.060 --> 03:12:17.300
which is truly conscious. If I can throw my... It's only two cents worth of... That would really

03:12:17.300 --> 03:12:21.620
piss off Karl Marx, by the way, if we create machines that are conscious. Exactly. This is

03:12:21.620 --> 03:12:25.700
actually part of the... There's two good logical arguments against the labor theory of value. One

03:12:25.700 --> 03:12:30.260
of what it becomes, machines become intelligent. And the other was that if the declining rate of

03:12:30.260 --> 03:12:38.820
profit applies in capitalism, it'll apply as a rate of socialism as well. A guy called Khalid

03:12:38.820 --> 03:12:43.780
made that argument. So his argument was just unsound. But yeah, intelligent machines would

03:12:43.780 --> 03:12:49.220
completely screw Marx up. Yeah. But do you not like that world where machines have

03:12:50.180 --> 03:12:57.380
not only intelligence, but consciousness, a soul? Yeah. And I know that's one of your interests,

03:12:57.380 --> 03:13:03.940
one of your potential endeavors. And the Kurzweil idea that there's some singularity we're approaching

03:13:03.940 --> 03:13:08.260
as we just get increasing processing power. It's not processing power, it's imagination.

03:13:09.220 --> 03:13:11.060
And I think... Whatever the heck that means.

03:13:11.860 --> 03:13:15.940
Whatever the heck that means, yeah. I mean, you would have had imaginative insights from your

03:13:15.940 --> 03:13:24.900
papers in automating motoring between the hyper-intelligent machine or the machine-human

03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:28.820
interface where the standards can be lower for the machine and higher for the human. Okay,

03:13:28.820 --> 03:13:32.820
that's an insight you would have had at some point, and then you've worked it further.

03:13:32.820 --> 03:13:36.820
So I've had insights like that as well, and I have no idea where they come from. They just

03:13:36.820 --> 03:13:41.460
hit me in the head, and I just write them down, and they solve a problem that I didn't even know

03:13:41.460 --> 03:13:49.860
my mind was working on. Okay? So how can we get a machine to do that? And I do not know the answer,

03:13:49.860 --> 03:13:55.540
but one thing I think is a potential is I think we have to create AI that has feelings,

03:13:56.660 --> 03:14:03.300
AI that wants to survive. Because if you think how our intelligence evolved, it's on this planet

03:14:03.300 --> 03:14:07.940
in a struggle between predator and prey, and intelligent became a survival technique.

03:14:07.940 --> 03:14:13.220
I find the ideas of Ernest Becker with Denial of Death really powerful, which is that humans

03:14:15.380 --> 03:14:21.460
will not only have emotions and are trying to survive, they're able to

03:14:22.900 --> 03:14:31.940
ponder out in the distant future their mortality. Yes. And that is a driving force for even greater

03:14:31.940 --> 03:14:40.580
creation that animals are able to do, more primitive animals. And so there is some element

03:14:40.580 --> 03:14:47.140
where I agree with you. I think for AI systems to have something like consciousness, they have to

03:14:47.780 --> 03:14:54.900
fear their mortality. Exactly. And I think if you do it, then you can't produce an AI

03:14:55.540 --> 03:14:59.620
whose behavior you can control. I mean, when you have kids,

03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:06.100
you can't control their behavior. You know, that's the trade-off.

03:15:06.100 --> 03:15:10.660
You give life to an anarchist. One of my favorite instances in my family life,

03:15:13.460 --> 03:15:19.300
I like all my nurses and nephews, but one's got a real quirk to her. And I was standing over her

03:15:19.300 --> 03:15:24.740
cot when she was literally like about six months old, and she was gurgling away to herself. And her

03:15:24.740 --> 03:15:30.020
father waved his fingers and said, stop making that noise. And this little six-month-old kid

03:15:30.020 --> 03:15:37.140
goes, and I said, boy, you're going to have issues with that one night. Anarchist was born.

03:15:37.140 --> 03:15:41.940
Yeah. And so you can't control this life you give birth to. And that's the threat of AI.

03:15:41.940 --> 03:15:45.620
Terrifying and exciting. It is. And I think we should take that

03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:51.860
risk at some stage. But I think to do it with what actually let artificial intelligence involve

03:15:51.860 --> 03:15:54.900
in this environment in which it fears its own death.

03:15:55.700 --> 03:16:03.300
Yeah. Yeah. I think there's a lot of beauty there, but there's also a lot of destruction

03:16:03.300 --> 03:16:07.780
that's possible. So you have to be extremely careful. But that's kind of the cutting edge

03:16:07.780 --> 03:16:14.900
of which we often operate as a humanity. Let me ask you for advice. Can you give advice

03:16:14.900 --> 03:16:20.980
to young people in high school and college? Maybe they're interested in economics?

03:16:22.020 --> 03:16:27.940
Maybe they have other career ideas. What advice would you give them about a career they can have

03:16:27.940 --> 03:16:32.820
that they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of? Mainly in a career, I say don't do an

03:16:32.820 --> 03:16:43.700
economics degree. There's a little book. Econ comics. Econ comics, taking the con out of

03:16:43.700 --> 03:16:50.580
economics. So they should start with that and then say screw it to an economics degree.

03:16:50.580 --> 03:16:56.020
Yeah. Because what you learn is an obsolete technology. Learning economics at a university

03:16:56.020 --> 03:17:01.940
is like learning to make astronomy. Okay. Earth-centric, equilibrium,

03:17:03.940 --> 03:17:06.660
epicycles being added to make your models fit the data.

03:17:06.660 --> 03:17:11.860
So it's not that economics is not a discipline worth deeply studying. It's that the university

03:17:11.860 --> 03:17:18.020
education around economics is bad. So I'd say learn system dynamics. Do a course in system

03:17:18.020 --> 03:17:23.540
dynamics, which you can apply in any field, and then apply what you learn out of system dynamics

03:17:23.540 --> 03:17:26.260
to the issues of economics if that's what interests you.

03:17:26.260 --> 03:17:29.940
So get a sort of base engineering education.

03:17:29.940 --> 03:17:34.900
A base engineering education. That is far better than doing an economics degree.

03:17:34.900 --> 03:17:41.460
In terms of life, my life is pretty chaotic in many, many ways. My friends and family will tell

03:17:41.460 --> 03:17:47.700
me that every opportunity. But the thing is, I'll tell you an example of a really funny

03:17:48.260 --> 03:17:51.220
incident that occurred to me. Because I led this student revolt at Sydney University,

03:17:51.220 --> 03:17:56.980
as I mentioned, when I was 20 years old. And then in about 28 or so, I went to a restaurant

03:17:56.980 --> 03:18:02.100
one night and I found a bunch of guys, all guys, who'd done accounting at the university,

03:18:02.100 --> 03:18:06.340
but had also been part of the student revolt. So they hadn't seen me for about a decade and

03:18:06.340 --> 03:18:09.540
they said, what have you been doing, Steve? And I talked about what I'd done. So I'd been a school

03:18:09.540 --> 03:18:15.700
teacher for a while. I then worked in overseas aid. I was doing computer programming at the time

03:18:15.700 --> 03:18:19.620
and I'd forgotten what else I was doing at that point. So I explained it to all of them.

03:18:19.620 --> 03:18:23.060
And they were at a Bucks night, one of them having a wedding coming up the next week.

03:18:23.060 --> 03:18:29.140
And one of them said, I wish I'd done that. And there was silence around the table that was

03:18:29.140 --> 03:18:34.740
obviously silent agreement. And I looked at them and said, hang on guys, look at the downside of

03:18:34.740 --> 03:18:41.860
my life. You know, like you're getting married. I don't have a girlfriend right now. You've all got

03:18:41.860 --> 03:18:47.460
secure jobs. I'm unemployed. Okay. You own a house. I haven't even got a car. You know,

03:18:47.460 --> 03:18:50.980
look at the downside of my life. And the bloke who was the kingpin of that group,

03:18:50.980 --> 03:18:56.820
a very innovative bunch of guys in the student revolt. So you said, Steve, we would still

03:18:57.380 --> 03:19:02.740
all rather have done what you have done. And they did accounting because it was safe.

03:19:03.860 --> 03:19:05.860
Always get a job. They were bored shitless.

03:19:06.660 --> 03:19:10.500
Did you have a sense that the chaos you're always

03:19:11.540 --> 03:19:16.020
jumping into was dangerous or was it just the pull of it?

03:19:16.020 --> 03:19:21.860
I simply couldn't not do it. It was part of me that I couldn't swallow this economic stuff.

03:19:21.860 --> 03:19:29.620
Once I was exposed to why it was so wrong, then I was on a crusade to make it right. And that's been

03:19:29.620 --> 03:19:34.980
part of my nature all through my life. I don't know why. So it wasn't that I made a choice to do it,

03:19:34.980 --> 03:19:39.780
is that I couldn't be true to myself without doing it. And I find a lot of people get caught

03:19:39.780 --> 03:19:44.020
in a life where they're doing it because it works for some financial or other reason,

03:19:44.020 --> 03:19:48.500
but they're not being true to themselves. And as messy as my life is, as much shit I've got

03:19:48.500 --> 03:19:52.580
myself caught up in, and there's a lot of that in my personal and financial life right now,

03:19:52.580 --> 03:19:57.540
which is a pain in the ass. I would rather have had that nature than not.

03:19:58.420 --> 03:20:01.060
You would rather take the pain in the ass than not.

03:20:01.060 --> 03:20:02.420
Yep. Yep. Yep.

03:20:02.420 --> 03:20:09.540
Let me ask a dark question. What's the darkest place you've ever gone to in your mind?

03:20:09.540 --> 03:20:15.060
So in all that rollercoaster of life, have there been periods where it's been really...

03:20:15.060 --> 03:20:21.220
I think I've had to cope with depression in the last five years since I started reading

03:20:21.220 --> 03:20:24.180
neoclassical economists on climate change. Sorry to laugh.

03:20:24.180 --> 03:20:27.860
Got to come back to that one. So that's where my wife's going to come into this story.

03:20:27.940 --> 03:20:34.420
So I was reading Richard Toll, a paper from 2009 called The Economics of Climate Change,

03:20:34.420 --> 03:20:39.300
Journal of Economic Perspectives, I think. And I read this section where he says that

03:20:39.300 --> 03:20:46.100
one of the ways they tried to calibrate what climate change was due is they assumed that

03:20:46.100 --> 03:20:51.540
the relationship between GDP and temperature over space would apply over time as well.

03:20:53.220 --> 03:20:53.780
Yes.

03:20:53.780 --> 03:20:59.220
And I read that and thought that is so fucking stupid. Because all it's saying is that if

03:20:59.220 --> 03:21:03.860
there's a 10 degree temperature difference between New York and Florida and a 20% difference in

03:21:03.860 --> 03:21:09.460
income, then a 10 degree increase in temperature will cause GDP by 4 by 20%. It is so insanely

03:21:09.460 --> 03:21:18.740
stupid. So when I read that line, I just did this. I was in shock at how stupid it was. My wife,

03:21:18.740 --> 03:21:25.860
who's Thai and brings in treats for me all day, walks into the room and she speaks in a staccato

03:21:25.860 --> 03:21:31.220
English and says to me, why are you like this? And I said, I'm just doing this work on climate

03:21:31.220 --> 03:21:35.700
change. And she interrupts me and says, oh, why you do that stuff? Nobody's interested in

03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:42.740
climate change. You can't do anything to change it. If we die, we die. And that perfect Buddhist

03:21:43.300 --> 03:21:46.980
grounding. And I thought, well, I can't argue with her again.

03:21:48.340 --> 03:21:53.380
So that sort of stopped me on the depression. But that's the darkest point when I looked at it and

03:21:53.380 --> 03:22:01.380
I thought that this arrogance, this stupidity, this humbug and the economists meant that we

03:22:01.380 --> 03:22:05.860
were potentially jeopardizing the lives of billions of people and Christ knows how many

03:22:05.860 --> 03:22:12.260
other life forms. And having that knowledge is the most depressing experience of my life.

03:22:13.460 --> 03:22:20.260
That ideas, simple models, combined with arrogance, can lead to the

03:22:21.780 --> 03:22:28.420
potential destruction of human civilization. That was a very heavy. And then your wife came in with-

03:22:28.420 --> 03:22:29.460
And broke me out of it.

03:22:31.140 --> 03:22:35.620
Nature wins in the end. And sort of accept the flow of life.

03:22:35.620 --> 03:22:39.780
You should really enjoy that book, The Earth Avides, because it's got that same beautiful

03:22:39.780 --> 03:22:46.500
sense to it. Life will survive whatever we do. I was actually talking with a good mate of mine,

03:22:46.500 --> 03:22:50.660
an ex-geologist, and he's now a professor of economics. And he said as a geologist,

03:22:50.660 --> 03:22:55.380
he really hated people talking about the Anthropocene epoch. And I said, well,

03:22:55.380 --> 03:23:01.220
it shouldn't be the Anthropocene epoch. It'll be the Anthropocene event. Because an epoch

03:23:01.220 --> 03:23:09.620
is millions of years and a huge period of life on the planet. And we might be snuffed out in 10,000

03:23:09.620 --> 03:23:16.580
years of human civilization. And that's not much slower than the meteors wiping out the dinosaurs.

03:23:16.580 --> 03:23:23.700
The dinosaurs lasted for a long time after that event. So we'd just be a layer in the surface

03:23:23.700 --> 03:23:29.700
of the planet with plastics and strange metals like that at some point. So we're just an epoch.

03:23:29.700 --> 03:23:34.500
The life will abide. Life will survive us. But there's so much life we're going to take down with

03:23:34.980 --> 03:23:41.540
in this whole period. And there's so many of our own lives we're going to terminate for no good reason.

03:23:42.900 --> 03:23:47.940
I'm looking at this Richard Tall character. I'll definitely have to look at some of his papers.

03:23:47.940 --> 03:23:52.420
It does look like, boy, is he oversimplifying and do a lot of people-

03:23:52.420 --> 03:23:56.500
Oh my God. Check his one on how good it'll be to lose AMOC.

03:23:57.220 --> 03:24:03.860
That said, I'm going to approach all of these topics with humility. And I would like to have

03:24:03.860 --> 03:24:09.140
some conversations if people can recommend. My default position is always with the scientists.

03:24:09.780 --> 03:24:15.380
But even above that, my default position is with those who are humble versus those who are arrogant.

03:24:16.740 --> 03:24:22.100
This idea that because you're a quote unquote expert, you deserve to have arrogance is a silly

03:24:22.100 --> 03:24:29.940
idea to me. Again, going to the broader view of life on earth. Nature is the only one that

03:24:29.940 --> 03:24:39.780
gets to be arrogant and it chooses not to. So let me ask you about love. What role does love

03:24:39.780 --> 03:24:43.540
play in this whole thing? Did Karl Marx have a model for that?

03:24:43.540 --> 03:24:48.500
Oh, Marx was madly in love with Genevieve von Westhalen and wrote love poetry to her

03:24:48.500 --> 03:24:53.940
long before he wrote Das Kapital. And he was infatuated with her. He ended up also impregnating

03:24:54.900 --> 03:25:01.060
his housekeeper. So there's a son of Karl Marx, who was the son of the housekeeper,

03:25:01.060 --> 03:25:08.980
not the Jenny. There are numerous daughters. So he had a complicated view of love.

03:25:08.980 --> 03:25:15.780
Oh yeah. There's a dialectic on love there. He had an idealistic view with Jenny.

03:25:15.780 --> 03:25:21.700
And he was rejected because he wasn't, not by Jenny, she was madly in love with him as well.

03:25:21.700 --> 03:25:25.860
So it was a real passionate love affair from the very outset. But then of course,

03:25:25.860 --> 03:25:30.420
you have children, lots of them die. There's a huge amount of tragedy in his life as well.

03:25:30.980 --> 03:25:38.020
He and Jenny were forced out of Chelsea by a cholera epidemic. My vision for London back

03:25:38.020 --> 03:25:44.980
in the 1850s and 60s was Calcutta in the 1970s. That's really what life was like.

03:25:44.980 --> 03:25:48.820
So there's a lot of hardship in his life as well. And he was always poor.

03:25:49.780 --> 03:25:55.860
And so, you know, only Ingalls kept him alive financially. He applied for one job

03:25:55.860 --> 03:26:03.620
outside of, he never got an academic job. He was pushed out of Prussia as a newspaper author.

03:26:04.260 --> 03:26:09.780
But he also, he applied for a job as a clerk in the British railway system,

03:26:09.780 --> 03:26:17.300
was turned down because they couldn't read his handwriting. So I think I'm a bit similar there.

03:26:17.300 --> 03:26:20.180
So yeah, there's a lot of love and passion.

03:26:20.900 --> 03:26:24.260
But in general, what do you think is the role of love in the human condition?

03:26:24.260 --> 03:26:27.780
It's vital. I mean, that feeling of passionate

03:26:30.020 --> 03:26:35.060
desire and respect for somebody else. And there's perverted forms of love as well,

03:26:35.060 --> 03:26:41.220
so I'll leave that out. But somebody having a really, a deep bond which goes beyond

03:26:42.260 --> 03:26:46.980
just sexual attraction. Like I've had that four or five times in my life with different women,

03:26:46.980 --> 03:26:50.740
at different times. And I've stuffed up the most important one very early on.

03:26:52.340 --> 03:27:00.420
And that feeling is incredible. And you couldn't have life worth living without that.

03:27:01.300 --> 03:27:05.860
So it's an essential part of who we are. But what we have to do is to transfer it,

03:27:05.860 --> 03:27:12.740
not just to the rest of our species, but to all species. And that's, I think, what's vital.

03:27:12.740 --> 03:27:20.260
And how do we maintain that over generations? And I think that idea that we can actually

03:27:20.260 --> 03:27:24.180
hang on to that general sense of respect and not lose it again. Because the amount of life

03:27:24.180 --> 03:27:31.620
we've terminated on this planet, the warlike side of humanity, that is too much of a defining

03:27:31.620 --> 03:27:35.700
feature of our species. That's the opposite of love. It's hate. But it's pleasure and

03:27:35.700 --> 03:27:39.700
inflicting pain on others. When you see people killing others in a warlike environment,

03:27:39.700 --> 03:27:45.860
they're enjoying themselves. It's rarely, sometimes it's self-defense, but when you

03:27:45.860 --> 03:27:51.220
have spoken to people who've been involved in combat and been involved in riots and said,

03:27:51.220 --> 03:27:55.220
when you see somebody rioting, bashing people up, they're enjoying themselves. It's not anger

03:27:55.220 --> 03:27:58.340
they're feeling, it's pleasure. There's a dark aspect to human nature.

03:27:58.340 --> 03:28:04.420
Very dark. But there's also the capacity to rise above that.

03:28:04.420 --> 03:28:08.580
And I think, like you put us on a spectrum between chimpanzees at one extreme and bonobos

03:28:08.580 --> 03:28:14.580
at the other. We're too close to the chimpanzees. And bonobos are just having fun, having lots of

03:28:14.580 --> 03:28:18.500
sex. Every time they do anything, they fuck first and do the work later and then fuck afterwards

03:28:18.500 --> 03:28:24.580
to celebrate. Fuck first, ask questions later. It's like that Scent of a Woman, one of my favorite

03:28:24.580 --> 03:28:29.860
films where Al Pacino gives advice to a cat. He says, when in doubt, fuck.

03:28:32.660 --> 03:28:38.180
It's good life advice for a cat, especially. We mentioned that death seems to be maybe

03:28:38.180 --> 03:28:48.180
fundamental to creating a conscious AI. Do you think about your own death? Are you afraid of it?

03:28:49.780 --> 03:28:54.420
I'm afraid of going through it. Not the other side?

03:28:55.140 --> 03:28:59.860
You're not afraid of being on the other side? I don't think there is another side. I'm agnostic.

03:29:00.580 --> 03:29:04.900
I'm atheist when pressed and agnostic. The one thing that I think I can understand why

03:29:04.900 --> 03:29:11.380
religion exists is that the whole thing that something exists is itself a dilemma. You have

03:29:11.380 --> 03:29:17.460
to take on faith that reality exists, whether it's a simulation or actual reality, it exists.

03:29:17.460 --> 03:29:21.700
And that itself can't be explained in any scientific manner. I mean, you can talk about

03:29:21.700 --> 03:29:26.820
antiprotons and protons and the sum being zero and so on. But why did it even happen in the first

03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:33.140
place? So there's part you simply have to take on faith. So there was darkness before.

03:29:33.140 --> 03:29:36.580
We don't know. And there's darkness after.

03:29:36.580 --> 03:29:39.460
Yeah. And I don't know if we're going to be alive on the other side of that darkness,

03:29:39.460 --> 03:29:44.900
I think individually, no. But the way you can live on is by what you do to human consciousness.

03:29:44.900 --> 03:29:47.060
How do you hope people remember you?

03:29:49.540 --> 03:29:55.620
As someone who managed to integrate economics with an appreciation for life.

03:29:56.500 --> 03:30:05.940
Well, I have to say, as a bit of a callback, you're one deadly bastard. It's a huge honor that you

03:30:05.940 --> 03:30:10.580
would come down and talk to me. You're a brilliant person. You're a hilarious person. The humility

03:30:10.580 --> 03:30:14.100
shines through. The brilliance shines through. Thank you so much for spending this time.

03:30:14.100 --> 03:30:17.940
Well, thank you, Alex. You do the same for humanity. I mean, when I saw that email from you,

03:30:17.940 --> 03:30:20.100
my eyes popped out on my head. Okay.

03:30:20.100 --> 03:30:23.780
Well, you should hold your judgment. I got to show you the sex dungeon I have.

03:30:23.780 --> 03:30:30.180
