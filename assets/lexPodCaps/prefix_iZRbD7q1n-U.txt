00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
A male chimp is more than enough to kill any human on the planet,

00:03.080 --> 00:04.240
including Gordon Ryan.

00:04.280 --> 00:09.880
So Gordon Ryan, fighting a chimp, a good size, a thousand times.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.280
How many times does he win?

00:11.320 --> 00:12.880
He loses a thousand times.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.800
It's not even competitive.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.840
It's not even remotely competitive.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.040
Do you think he will disagree?

00:17.920 --> 00:18.320
No.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.320
Do you think anyone will disagree?

00:21.560 --> 00:22.040
Anyone?

00:22.280 --> 00:23.200
Yeah, morons.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.880
The following is a conversation with John Donoher.

00:30.360 --> 00:34.600
His third time on this podcast, he's widely considered to be one of the

00:34.600 --> 00:37.280
greatest minds in martial arts history.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.080
This is a Lex Fridman podcast.

00:40.320 --> 00:43.280
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.440
And now, dear friends, here's John Donoher.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.960
The ADCC is the premier submission grappling tournament in the world.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.240
We just had it a couple of weeks ago.

00:55.880 --> 01:00.520
We saw many demonstrations of greatness from athletes you coached.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.240
But a year ago, the team and you were at a very low point.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.600
Take me through that journey.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.680
What was the lowest point?

01:09.360 --> 01:15.760
We had a very, very tight team for many years, which began in New York City.

01:16.440 --> 01:21.680
During the peak of COVID, training in New York became very difficult to sustain.

01:22.200 --> 01:27.200
So most of the team despised the city of New York.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.200
I was the only person in the group that liked living in New York.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.080
I think part of the problem was that I was the only one who

01:35.080 --> 01:36.520
actually lived in Manhattan.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.680
The others had to commute to New York.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.720
And there's a world of difference between living in New York and

01:41.720 --> 01:42.920
commuting to New York.

01:43.360 --> 01:48.280
So most of them had a very negative view of New York City that was compounded by

01:48.320 --> 01:53.480
COVID when even the basic active training became very, very difficult.

01:54.120 --> 01:58.280
And so everyone decided they want to leave.

01:58.440 --> 02:04.600
So there was a prospect of a complete breakup between myself and the team, or I

02:04.600 --> 02:05.560
would have to leave New York.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.800
There was a difficult decision for me to make as I lived in New York for 30 years.

02:09.400 --> 02:15.440
I had built my life there and had most of my friends and associates that I know

02:15.440 --> 02:17.400
here in America, New Yorkers.

02:18.360 --> 02:24.400
So I thought, you know, these guys have been incredibly loyal to me as a student.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.240
So I should also be loyal to them, of course.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.200
So I decided that if they wanted to leave, I would go with them.

02:30.800 --> 02:37.280
We decided to go to Puerto Rico because there was a private gym where we could

02:37.280 --> 02:39.320
train through the COVID period.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.400
I personally wanted to go to Texas.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.440
I thought that Texas was a better place for the team to go.

02:45.680 --> 02:51.840
But many of the students, including senior students like Gordon Ryan, Craig Jones,

02:52.320 --> 02:59.240
had been to Puerto Rico and stayed with one of the head officials of ADCC, Mo Jasim.

02:59.920 --> 03:06.280
So they loved their experience in Puerto Rico and almost everyone wanted to go

03:06.280 --> 03:06.880
down there.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.960
So I tried to explain to them, there's a world of difference between going to a

03:10.960 --> 03:16.120
place for vacation versus living there, but that didn't have any effect.

03:16.120 --> 03:20.240
So the decision was made, a majority decision was made to go to Puerto Rico.

03:23.760 --> 03:31.360
In Puerto Rico, the conditions in which the team lived changed significantly.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.440
When you're in New York, New York is such a big city that if there's any tension

03:37.440 --> 03:41.000
between team members, and inevitably there will be in a competitive sport where

03:41.000 --> 03:45.560
everyone's fighting each other, you can kind of bury them in the size of the city

03:45.560 --> 03:47.440
because there's so many distractions in New York.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.680
You know, you come in, you do your workout, you go outside and it's New York City.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.360
In Puerto Rico, we lived in a very small local town, Dorado, and most of the

03:59.360 --> 04:00.880
athletes were living with each other.

04:01.600 --> 04:06.320
And so unlike New York, where there was always a break, you train together, but

04:06.400 --> 04:09.840
when training was over, you went about your life in New York and New Jersey.

04:10.560 --> 04:17.560
With everyone living in very close proximity to each other, any tensions got

04:17.560 --> 04:19.680
magnified because there was no relief from them.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.560
You didn't get to get away from people.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.960
If you had a problem with someone on the mat, well now you had to live with them

04:25.960 --> 04:31.000
for the rest of the day and the night, and this goes on for long periods of time.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.960
So I believe it had the effect of magnifying whatever tensions there were.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.320
In particular, there was a family tension between two brothers,

04:40.360 --> 04:42.280
which magnified over time.

04:44.960 --> 04:51.400
And, you know, as so often is the case, you get two brothers growing up, one

04:52.040 --> 04:59.200
older, one younger, and the younger one wants to grow and feel somewhat like a

04:59.200 --> 05:01.320
young tree underneath a bigger tree.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.520
And sometimes people just need their space.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.440
So there was some, there was some unhappiness and, as a younger brother, I

05:09.440 --> 05:14.600
can understand, as a little tree that had to grow up under a bigger tree.

05:14.920 --> 05:15.320
Yeah.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.400
So, fuck the big tree.

05:18.880 --> 05:19.760
There's a lot of aggression.

05:19.760 --> 05:20.440
I have to work on it.

05:20.440 --> 05:20.760
I'm sorry.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.200
Unresolved family issues coming out here.

05:22.880 --> 05:23.440
I'm just kidding.

05:23.440 --> 05:23.960
I love you.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.160
He doesn't, he's lying.

05:26.280 --> 05:30.600
So, as time went by, these, these tensions started increasing.

05:30.600 --> 05:36.240
They came to a point where it was difficult for them even to be in the

05:36.240 --> 05:37.880
training room together at that point.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.280
You're starting to, you know, when, once training takes a hit, then you

05:42.280 --> 05:49.920
got to start to address these, the attempts at reconciliation fell through

05:50.120 --> 05:55.720
and a decision was made to, to move to Texas.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.440
I wanted everyone to move as a team.

05:58.160 --> 06:04.960
What I wanted to do was keep the team together as long as the period leading

06:04.960 --> 06:07.440
up to ADCC so that everyone could train together.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.960
So I said, okay, there's problems, but let's just tough it out.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.720
One year we moved to Texas.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.280
Let's just go there and keep unity.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.920
If some people don't want to train with other people, that's fine.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.280
But I believe that the team would be weakened by breaking apart.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.960
I believe that they had an excellent rapport as training partners.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.360
Their technical level was increasing dramatically.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.880
Um, many of the younger athletes are really starting to come into

06:33.880 --> 06:35.440
their own and really develop well.

06:35.920 --> 06:41.840
And so my take on it was, okay, if there's problems, so be it, but let's

06:41.840 --> 06:47.560
all just stay together until ADCC 2022 as a unified team, go out, prepare

06:47.560 --> 06:52.920
yourselves as best you can and, um, uh, and then after that, we can make a

06:52.920 --> 06:55.480
decision as to whether we break up or not.

06:56.160 --> 07:04.520
Um, but that was rejected and, uh, the team split and, um, uh, they moved to

07:04.520 --> 07:10.960
Austin, uh, we'd made prior arrangements to go to, uh, a local gym and, uh, they

07:11.000 --> 07:17.200
took that gym and, uh, we were left, uh, with no gym and, uh, more or

07:17.200 --> 07:19.360
less homeless in, uh, in Austin.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.560
So, uh,

07:20.560 --> 07:21.920
a year out from ADCC.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.160
Yes, this is one year out.

07:23.160 --> 07:28.600
So roughly three quarters of the, uh, competitive athletes left in one week.

07:29.320 --> 07:33.800
Um, so, uh, at that point, uh, that was probably the lowest point

07:33.840 --> 07:40.200
because at that point, not only do we not have a place to train, um, we had

07:40.200 --> 07:47.440
very few training partners for the few that had remained and, um, uh, the main

07:47.680 --> 07:51.320
athlete in the team, Gordon Ryan was going through a particularly bad

07:51.320 --> 07:54.800
spell with his unresolved stomach issues.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.680
And there was doubt as to whether or not he could compete at all.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.640
And was actively thinking about retiring from the sport.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.720
So maybe not compete ever again, but yeah, yeah.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.760
So that was a time when it was like, man, this is the whole program seems

08:08.760 --> 08:10.320
to be dead in the water at this point.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.240
Um, uh, most of the competitive athletes were gone.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.840
There were very few training partners for the few that remained.

08:15.840 --> 08:22.160
And the main athlete around whom the group had initially bonded, um, was

08:22.160 --> 08:24.800
seemingly out of action, possibly permanently.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.600
Where was your mind?

08:26.680 --> 08:27.600
What were you mentally?

08:27.640 --> 08:34.680
Uh, my, my, my thinking is everything bad passes in time.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.480
I've had a lot of bad points in my life.

08:36.600 --> 08:44.200
So, um, uh, my life experiences, whenever things seem dark, have patience.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.800
Time will ultimately cure most ills, not all of them, but most of them.

08:48.480 --> 08:54.480
And, um, uh, I'm confident that if you give me a new crop of students, I can,

08:55.600 --> 08:59.560
I can produce magic, but it's going to take time.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.840
So that confidence was in part a source of strength.

09:03.120 --> 09:03.560
Yes.

09:03.600 --> 09:09.240
It's just like, I wasn't confident that ADCC 2022 would go well because we

09:09.240 --> 09:11.520
only had one year without a gym.

09:11.920 --> 09:19.760
And with a team that was completely broken up to, um, to, to even an

09:19.880 --> 09:25.240
attempt to get into ADCC, so, um, uh, things looked a little grim, but I was

09:25.240 --> 09:30.120
confident, you know, given enough time, I get in a new, uh, group of students and

09:30.120 --> 09:39.000
work, um, as it turns out, uh, one of the, uh, demonstration partners that, uh, I

09:39.040 --> 09:43.920
used during filming for instructional videos who lives in Boston, uh, John

09:43.920 --> 09:49.680
Carlo Badoni was interested in the idea of coming down and training, but he'd

09:49.680 --> 09:52.960
always felt like it would be difficult because there were people in his way

09:52.960 --> 09:58.560
class who were already there and he felt it would be awkward, um, but now that

09:58.560 --> 10:00.760
they had left that opened up an area for him.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.160
So he was the first one to come down.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.080
He moved from Boston to, um, uh, Austin, Texas.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.960
I began teaching at a local school.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.000
It was rather like going back into my earliest days in judicial.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.960
I went from teaching at the big hands of Gracie Academy to a tiny school in

10:15.960 --> 10:20.520
Puerto Rico and now an even smaller school in Austin, Texas, and locals would

10:20.520 --> 10:24.880
come in and train and I would watch every day teaching there twice a day,

10:24.880 --> 10:29.560
seven days a week, um, and I would see people come in and train and I would say

10:29.560 --> 10:33.560
this guy has some potential or this guy has some potential and I would recruit

10:33.560 --> 10:37.600
people and bring them to another gym where they would train with the

10:37.600 --> 10:42.480
professionals and if they proved adept and hardworking and someone who can work

10:42.480 --> 10:47.720
well in a team, uh, they would stay in and build their skills as time went by.

10:47.880 --> 10:52.960
Um, more and more such people started coming in and we had some remarkable

10:52.960 --> 10:56.920
people like a young South African, purple belt, Luke Griffith came in.

10:57.400 --> 11:03.480
Uh, he had lost in the European trials, uh, for ADCC and he was down on his

11:03.480 --> 11:04.600
luck. He came into Austin.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.040
He did a show against a local purple belt and lost again.

11:08.360 --> 11:13.040
So he was feeling bad about his performance in his future.

11:13.040 --> 11:17.120
He came in and I thought he was a lovely kid who worked hard and trained well.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.840
Um, so he became one of the main training partners.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.640
He was similar size to Gordon.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.320
So I encouraged him to train with, with Gordon whenever he could.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.920
And, um, he, more and more people started coming into train under

11:28.920 --> 11:30.000
that kind of basis.

11:30.560 --> 11:37.080
Um, one day I got a text from, uh, Gordon who was filming an instructional video

11:37.080 --> 11:40.480
in Boston, he said, Hey, you know, Nicholas Mirigali was training at this.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.800
He was, uh, shooting video at the same time as me.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.720
And we, we just, uh, did some grappling.

11:45.720 --> 11:49.480
He's a really nice guy and, uh, he's literally never trained with, without a

11:49.480 --> 11:53.040
gi before he's, uh, for those of you who don't know Nicholas Mirigali is a, uh,

11:53.040 --> 11:57.000
one of the outstanding Gi Jiu-Jitsu competitors of his generation.

11:57.480 --> 12:02.600
Um, has an amazing, uh, game and is a superstar with, with the, uh, the

12:02.600 --> 12:07.760
Gi side of the sport, but had never even trained without a gi once in his life.

12:07.760 --> 12:12.000
So his first ever no gi training session is with Gordon Ryan, the best

12:12.160 --> 12:13.600
no-gi competitor of all time.

12:14.280 --> 12:17.240
And, uh, I remember Gordon texting me saying, Hey, he's really talented.

12:17.240 --> 12:20.600
He's a nice guy and, um, he wants to come down to Texas and train.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.480
So I was like, yeah, sounds great.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.160
So over time, just more and more people started coming in.

12:26.880 --> 12:32.920
And, um, uh, I told everyone, like, you guys are at a severe disadvantage.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.720
Like you're, you've got very little time to get ready for ADCC.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.000
Luke wasn't even in ADCC.

12:39.000 --> 12:39.960
He had to win trials.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.000
Same for, uh, Dan Manasoyo.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.160
He, he failed at trials and needed to get a win to even get into ADCC.

12:48.120 --> 12:55.200
So around this time, a doctor suggested by, uh, Mo Jasm, who had himself had

12:55.200 --> 12:59.600
stomach issues earlier in his life, began working with, uh, Gordon Ryan.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.680
And Mo is the organizer of ADCC.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.000
Yes, he's the head organizer.

13:06.480 --> 13:13.840
Um, he was able to get Gordon Ryan, not cured, but significantly

13:13.840 --> 13:15.040
better than he was before.

13:15.840 --> 13:21.800
Uh, and to a level where Gordon could, could train up to five to six days a week.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.760
And it was a big improvement on what was going on during the

13:25.760 --> 13:27.320
end of the time in Puerto Rico.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.480
So things started moving.

13:30.480 --> 13:37.840
We had a core group of, uh, athletes, uh, training at, um, a local gym, um, which

13:37.840 --> 13:44.880
was very, very generously offered to us by, uh, uh, the head manager of Roka

13:44.880 --> 13:50.320
Sunglasses, a company here in, um, uh, Austin, Texas, they have a private

13:50.320 --> 13:55.120
corporate gym, which we were able to train in and these talented youngsters

13:55.120 --> 13:59.560
from around the globe essentially came together and I said, you guys are going

13:59.560 --> 14:02.320
to have to train harder than you've ever trained in your lives because you've got

14:02.320 --> 14:07.640
less time to get ready for this than anyone and, uh, you're going to be going

14:07.640 --> 14:12.680
up against people potentially who know exactly what I teach because I've been

14:12.680 --> 14:16.120
teaching them a lot longer than I've been teaching you, um, in addition to

14:16.120 --> 14:17.920
the other best people in the world.

14:18.480 --> 14:22.280
So it was a, uh, an incredible challenge for them.

14:22.640 --> 14:27.760
And I must say all of them gave literally everything they had, everything

14:27.760 --> 14:30.160
I asked for, they gave twice as much.

14:30.320 --> 14:35.040
And, um, we had a crazy training schedule, as many as three classes per day.

14:35.560 --> 14:39.880
I know that that sounds easy, you know, three classes a day, but try doing it

14:39.880 --> 14:43.560
sometime, these classes are not your average classes, these are preparation

14:43.560 --> 14:47.680
for ADCC as they can both mentally and physically.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.800
Very, very hard.

14:49.080 --> 14:56.680
And, um, uh, we had many people come in and try to train alongside us and they

14:56.720 --> 15:02.040
fell off by the side of the road within days, forget about weeks, months, or

15:02.040 --> 15:10.760
a full year of this, um, I gave a very abbreviated set of skills for the

15:10.760 --> 15:15.840
athletes, I chopped everything down to what I believe were the most essential

15:15.840 --> 15:20.400
skills, um, uh, anything that wasn't essential to ADCC preparation was just

15:20.400 --> 15:27.280
pushed aside and, um, uh, they had to focus almost entirely on ADCC with one

15:27.280 --> 15:32.000
exception, I'll come to that soon, um, over the period of their training here

15:32.000 --> 15:32.560
in Austin.

15:33.080 --> 15:40.640
So it was compacted by time and also by, uh, uh, the breadth of skill that I

15:40.640 --> 15:45.280
taught, everything was just purely for ADCC preparation in a very short period

15:45.280 --> 15:52.360
of time, uh, Dan Manasoyo and Luke Griffith and Oliver Tarza all won European

15:52.360 --> 15:54.160
trials and got into ADCC.

15:54.840 --> 15:58.960
Nicholas Mirigali was already a superstar, so he was invited, but he had to show

15:58.960 --> 16:03.280
himself, so we enrolled him in local shows here in Austin where he had his

16:03.280 --> 16:10.120
first three, uh, no-gi matches, um, and with each match you could see progress

16:10.120 --> 16:14.760
being made, and so that convinced the ADCC people, okay, he's good enough to,

16:15.000 --> 16:15.640
to compete.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.720
Um, he ended up winning decisively a match against one of the greatest

16:19.720 --> 16:24.240
American grapplers of all time, Rafael Lovato, and this was like a clear sign

16:24.240 --> 16:28.960
that his skill level and no-gi was sufficient to, to justify an invite.

16:29.840 --> 16:35.320
And by the way, Lovato had an incredible, uh, set of matches in this ADCC.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.720
Yes, that was actually very impressive.

16:36.720 --> 16:43.880
And retired, which is really impressive and heartbreaking as well, but if you go

16:43.880 --> 16:45.360
out, that's a good way to go out.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.160
Indeed.

16:47.160 --> 16:52.520
So there was this, um, uh, long and tough preparation and it was compounded by the

16:52.520 --> 16:59.320
fact that as Gordon felt better, he felt a need to build up his own competitive

16:59.320 --> 17:04.800
record prior to ADCC, um, because he'd been inactive for so long with his stomach

17:04.800 --> 17:11.400
issue, so he proposed one of the most ambitious fight camps that I've ever

17:11.400 --> 17:16.280
heard of in grappling, which was he would take on the current WNO champion,

17:16.560 --> 17:19.880
Pedro Mourinho, whose number one is WNO.

17:20.600 --> 17:27.280
And, uh, also I believe the current, uh, no no-gi world champion in IBGJF as a

17:27.360 --> 17:29.040
tune-up match, as a warmup match.

17:29.080 --> 17:34.840
Then he would fight his old nemesis, uh, Felipe Pena, um, the only man who

17:34.840 --> 17:40.840
submitted Gordon at black belt and had defeated Gordon in an ADCC match in 2017.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.600
And then ADCC itself.

17:43.600 --> 17:50.200
So there was going to be three big high profile matches back to back and, uh,

17:51.200 --> 17:52.600
and very different rule sets.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.920
So WNO was a 15 minute match.

17:55.320 --> 17:59.760
Uh, the fight with Felipe Pena was no time limit, which is a very different

17:59.920 --> 18:02.880
format to compete in and then ADCC.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.560
So we had to drag out a 14 week camp covering three matches with three

18:07.560 --> 18:11.040
different rule sets, which went in diametrically opposite directions.

18:11.680 --> 18:17.720
And the entire team had to go through all of this over this, uh, 14 week

18:17.720 --> 18:22.480
period, um, in addition to the previous year that they had been working hard.

18:23.080 --> 18:27.440
Um, there was a further complication in the midst of all this Nicholas Mirigali

18:27.440 --> 18:32.080
had to go to the gi world championships and we had to throw an extra morning

18:32.080 --> 18:34.320
class for that to help him get ready.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.720
Um, Nicholas went on to win the open weight gold medal in the gi competition.

18:39.720 --> 18:43.720
And then the next day had to come back to Texas and begin his ADCC preparation.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.640
It was a crazy, crazy time.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.280
Um, but they all came through it so well.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.480
I'm immensely proud of what they did.

18:51.600 --> 18:58.560
And shockingly in the space of less than 12 months, we went from rock bottom to

18:58.560 --> 19:06.120
having a more successful ADCC, uh, team performance than we did the previous ADCC.

19:06.600 --> 19:11.040
Um, uh, it was in fact, the most successful team performance of the event

19:11.560 --> 19:17.440
and as testimony to how hard does those young men, uh, worked in, uh, in the

19:17.440 --> 19:23.160
course of less than a year to prepare themselves, if it can just linger on the

19:23.160 --> 19:30.320
low point, is it heartbreaking to you that the, uh, so-called down her death

19:30.320 --> 19:35.880
squad split or the team as it was originally called split, you know, we

19:35.880 --> 19:41.080
live a short life on this earth and you put so much of your love and work into

19:41.080 --> 19:42.960
this team and everybody put in the work.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.240
Does it break your heart?

19:44.600 --> 19:45.560
It was a sad time.

19:45.560 --> 19:51.640
Yeah, it was, um, it was, uh, you know, I'm not a particularly emotional

19:51.640 --> 19:54.960
person, um, but it was a, it was an emotional time for everyone.

19:54.960 --> 19:59.320
It was, I had an element of tragedy in so far as not only was it a team

19:59.320 --> 20:02.280
breakup, it was also a family breakup, which is much more serious.

20:02.960 --> 20:14.280
Um, I do believe that in time, uh, even the most intense family

20:14.280 --> 20:16.200
breakups can be reconciled.

20:16.880 --> 20:24.360
And I also believe that once dialogue begins, people will remember just how

20:24.360 --> 20:28.400
easy it was for us to get along and how tight we were for many, many years.

20:29.000 --> 20:38.120
Um, it's so easy to let a minute of anger destroy 10 years of, of, uh, of friendship.

20:38.720 --> 20:43.360
So, but there's also the weight of those 10 years.

20:43.400 --> 20:48.400
Like, um, when I ran into the old squad members at ADCC, we got

20:48.400 --> 20:49.640
along like a house on fire.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.720
It's like, we never had a problem.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.000
Um, so a house on fire is a good thing.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.360
Yes.

20:54.360 --> 20:54.760
Yes.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.160
Sorry.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.480
That's a New Zealand expression.

20:56.480 --> 20:56.680
Yeah.

20:57.160 --> 21:01.040
Um, uh, yeah, that definitely could have gone the other way.

21:01.040 --> 21:01.240
Right.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.920
Um, so only in New Zealand, I would say that is a good thing.

21:04.920 --> 21:05.160
Yeah.

21:05.720 --> 21:11.560
Um, so there's, there's, I still believe, you know, in, in time things will be fine,

21:11.720 --> 21:17.360
but, um, there was an element where, you know, youngsters need to grow.

21:17.600 --> 21:25.440
And, um, uh, sometimes think, think about it this way from the athletes perspective.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.440
There's a definitely a generational problem.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.880
I'm much older than my students.

21:31.240 --> 21:31.600
Okay.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.920
And the, the, the years and the viewpoint that I have is a reflection of the time

21:35.920 --> 21:42.080
in which I grew up and, uh, they're from a completely different generation with

21:42.080 --> 21:43.400
a completely different worldview.

21:44.240 --> 21:49.040
Um, it's, it's gotta be hard from the athletes perspective when you're

21:49.040 --> 21:53.880
training seven days a week and you, you're getting very, very good.

21:54.080 --> 21:58.240
You're beating everyone that's getting, getting put in front of you and you're

21:58.240 --> 22:01.880
losing very, very rarely, and it's always a tough competitive match when you do.

22:02.600 --> 22:07.480
Everyone around you is calling you a superstar and you look phenomenal.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.640
You check social media.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.600
Everyone's saying, you're, you're a God on the mat.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.520
And then you come into the gym and there's some old guy telling

22:15.520 --> 22:16.520
you, you're not good enough.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.840
And every day it's like, Oh, what does this guy want from me?

22:22.840 --> 22:24.280
How, how hard do I have to work?

22:24.640 --> 22:25.680
Like, you're not good enough.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.880
I go, I want you to be the best in the world.

22:28.000 --> 22:28.680
I want you to be good.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.560
I want you to be great.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.120
And all of your friends are telling you today, man, you're incredible.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.960
You submit me so easy to do this year.

22:34.960 --> 22:38.280
And then this old guy is just saying, no, you got to get better.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.360
You got to work more.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.680
You're not working hard enough.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.760
At some point you're going to be like, you know what?

22:44.760 --> 22:45.800
Fuck this old guy.

22:46.880 --> 22:47.880
Like it's, it's tough.

22:47.960 --> 22:51.000
You know, mentally I get why, you know, they, they left.

22:51.640 --> 22:55.880
When I was 20 years old, I didn't get along with the authority figures at all.

22:56.200 --> 23:00.400
And, um, uh, to have someone telling you, you've always got to work

23:00.400 --> 23:03.000
that little bit harder and know your skillsets, not complete.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
You still need distance in this when you're already doing very, very

23:07.000 --> 23:12.120
well and far better than all, but a tiny, tiny percentage of people.

23:12.680 --> 23:16.040
And then you've got this guy just constantly telling you, no,

23:16.480 --> 23:17.640
more has to be done.

23:17.800 --> 23:18.680
You're not there yet.

23:19.400 --> 23:24.880
Um, I can, you know, of course I understand the, just let me just enjoy this more.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.320
Like, uh, it's always a choice in life.

23:27.320 --> 23:33.560
Do you, you can be the best you possibly can, or you can go around where you

23:33.560 --> 23:35.080
just get to enjoy life a little more.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.320
You do other things, you know, like there's more to life than just the

23:38.320 --> 23:42.080
inside of a gym and learning how to do a better heel hook or a better double leg.

23:42.560 --> 23:47.520
Um, so of course, you know, years go by, you want to try the things.

23:47.520 --> 23:53.840
And, um, uh, you have to make this choice in life between extreme excellence

23:53.840 --> 23:57.920
versus being incredibly good, but maybe just enjoying my life a little more.

23:58.160 --> 23:58.280
Yeah.

23:58.280 --> 24:01.240
It's so interesting that incredibly good is a hard thing to deal with.

24:01.640 --> 24:07.240
I saw like when Kayla Harrison won her first gold medal and, uh, the Olympics,

24:08.000 --> 24:12.360
you know, to go back to the gym and to trust again, the, maybe the old man,

24:12.600 --> 24:17.120
you're, you're being too harsh on yourself, but to trust the old man.

24:17.120 --> 24:21.920
So, uh, Jimmy Pager and Jimmy Pager senior in that case to say, okay, we're

24:21.920 --> 24:27.320
going to go back to this grind and there's still a path to improvement.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.920
There's still a lot to grow and still have the humility, even though

24:30.920 --> 24:32.600
you've just demonstrated greatness.

24:33.240 --> 24:39.600
So really good is just a stepping stone to, to, to, to, to greatness.

24:40.160 --> 24:41.720
Um, that's really tough for athletes.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.840
Like, you know, winning is actually very difficult.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.560
Gold medals are very difficult.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.760
Plus there's the personal stuff of depression that comes with that, which

24:49.760 --> 24:52.520
is you give so much of yourself to trying to win that.

24:52.880 --> 24:57.120
And once you do, there's a lot of personal stuff you have to deal with,

24:57.280 --> 25:02.760
which is like, what, what, what do I want from life to understand?

25:02.760 --> 25:04.440
What is exactly what am I chasing?

25:04.440 --> 25:08.360
Is it just winning or is it some bigger picture of excellence?

25:08.600 --> 25:09.880
That's beyond just winning.

25:10.480 --> 25:12.720
So that, that's all, all of that mixed up together.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.720
And then when you have to be as a team, really close together, there's

25:16.720 --> 25:19.640
the personal relationships, all of that gets exacerbated.

25:19.880 --> 25:20.320
Yeah.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.560
Do you think the team ever gets back together?

25:24.160 --> 25:27.600
I think there's always, you know, there's definitely a chance of that right now.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.840
I think they have an excellent team themselves and they're doing very well.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.320
Uh, they had an excellent performance at ADCC.

25:34.600 --> 25:39.240
So there's not a need for them to, uh, to come to us.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.600
It's not like they, they lack anything.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.040
They still remember everything I taught them.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.520
They still coach and teach with the same methodology that I taught them.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.120
So, um, uh, I don't think they have any need to do so.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.920
Uh, if they did, it would be because they wanted to.

25:52.360 --> 25:57.800
Um, I still think many of the same personality conflicts that originated

25:57.800 --> 26:02.320
the conflict would re-emerge currently if, if they started training together.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.560
Uh, by the way, to pile on the compliments, they have really nice

26:05.560 --> 26:07.600
merch too, the t-shirts are just excellent.

26:08.320 --> 26:12.240
Um, what have you learned from that process about how to have a

26:12.240 --> 26:13.960
team with personal conflicts?

26:14.640 --> 26:17.200
Do you have to deal with these giant egos as well?

26:17.680 --> 26:20.120
The ego is a, is a part of super power too.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.080
So you don't want to.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.440
Yeah, you, you, you don't want to suppress egos.

26:23.520 --> 26:26.320
Like I always laugh when people say, leave your ego at the door.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.000
Like what do you think drives competition?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.240
Like if you want to be good at anything in life, you got to have an ego.

26:32.880 --> 26:40.040
Um, uh, no, I don't believe it's good or even a healthy thing to suppress egos.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.840
Um, I'm, I'm a realist and I understand that this is a sport where they make

26:43.840 --> 26:45.520
one gold medal per weight division.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.280
As guys get better, they're going to be looking at their training

26:49.280 --> 26:53.200
partners and thinking like, I'm going to have to fight this guy one day.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.040
And they're training next to each other.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.560
Of course there's going to be tension.

26:58.040 --> 27:03.200
Um, there's always going to be, uh, disagreements about, you know, what's

27:03.560 --> 27:07.960
the right way to act around, uh, certain people, certain issues.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.800
And people are going to come into conflict.

27:09.800 --> 27:14.640
Everyone's being programmed to be, uh, an alpha competitor.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.440
You get a room full of people like that.

27:16.440 --> 27:17.560
There's going to be conflict.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.880
Now your question was, well, is there a way to resolve this?

27:21.160 --> 27:21.840
Yeah, there was.

27:21.840 --> 27:27.000
And for eight to nine years, I was very successful with this, but there's

27:27.000 --> 27:31.400
also a tipping point where things can flare out of control and there

27:31.400 --> 27:32.800
will be periodic breakups.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.360
You know, you're not the first students I had that, that left.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.880
I've been coaching a lot longer than I've been coaching the squad.

27:38.480 --> 27:43.840
And, um, uh, I'm sure in the future, there'll be other students who leave me.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.520
That's just the nature of the beast.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.640
It's sad when it happens, but life goes on.

27:51.360 --> 27:56.800
Uh, like Bukowski said, love is a fog that fades with the first, uh,

27:56.800 --> 27:58.840
daylight of reality or something like that.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.880
So you even love is temporary.

28:02.400 --> 28:09.320
Uh, let me ask you about leading up the preparation for the athletes.

28:09.320 --> 28:14.640
I mean, this is such, given the darkness from, from a year ago from which you had

28:14.640 --> 28:19.600
to find glimmers of light and try to get greatness out of athletes, what was the

28:19.600 --> 28:25.840
mental preparation like for Gordon, for Nicholas, uh, for Giancarlo, for the

28:25.840 --> 28:31.320
other athletes, what was the mental side of things like, is there some key insights

28:31.320 --> 28:32.920
you can give to their mental preparation?

28:33.160 --> 28:38.880
I really think that people, when they talk about mental preparation, need to take a

28:38.880 --> 28:43.840
step back and realize that almost every element of what people describe as mental

28:43.840 --> 28:46.240
preparation has physical underpinnings.

28:47.280 --> 28:54.680
Um, literally 95% of what I teach the athletes is physical skills.

28:55.440 --> 29:01.800
And it's my belief that every mental aspect of competition, the most important,

29:01.800 --> 29:07.760
which will be confidence on stage is a direct result of the, the

29:07.760 --> 29:09.720
accumulation of physical skills.

29:11.680 --> 29:16.120
People tend to see things like confidence as a mental state.

29:17.360 --> 29:23.360
It is, but it comes out of the performance of physical skills.

29:25.640 --> 29:32.240
All my life, I've seen sports psychologists try to create confidence in

29:32.240 --> 29:34.360
athletes through non-physical means.

29:34.960 --> 29:40.040
And it always ends up being the same kind of cheesy motivational speeches, um,

29:40.080 --> 29:46.120
highlight video reels where they try to pump artificial confidence into people.

29:46.840 --> 29:52.040
And I've never been impressed by this, nor have I seen it have any kind of

29:52.560 --> 29:55.160
positive effect on, on athlete performance.

29:55.840 --> 30:01.760
What I do see build confidence is the sense that athletes are developing

30:01.760 --> 30:07.680
skills and using them successfully under conditions that closely mirror the

30:07.680 --> 30:09.000
event they're preparing for.

30:10.080 --> 30:14.120
Once they get this down, that's where true confidence comes from.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.400
Confidence doesn't come from words.

30:16.600 --> 30:21.960
It comes from accumulated skills, which experience shows you have

30:22.840 --> 30:26.680
been responsible for successful performances in the past.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.960
And if you accumulate enough of these, your confidence rises.

30:30.760 --> 30:36.680
So when it comes to the mental aspects of competition, I created a program

30:36.680 --> 30:41.080
where everyone had a, was given a set of skills that they had to work on skills

30:41.080 --> 30:44.240
directly related to what I believe is the most important elements of

30:44.240 --> 30:47.720
success in ADCC competition in the gym.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.400
They accumulated those skills over time.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.680
I do it in two different ways, depending on whether these are offensive

30:54.680 --> 30:59.000
skills or defensive skills for the accumulation of offensive skills.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.560
I like to have my athletes work with athletes who are lesser than

31:02.560 --> 31:08.280
themselves in ability so that they start to gain confidence over time.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.600
Just as you would never send a beginner into a weightlifting gym and put

31:11.600 --> 31:15.240
500 pounds on the bar and tell them to lift it, rather you would start with

31:16.000 --> 31:19.240
a wooden bar, then the metal bar, and then gradually accumulate weight over

31:19.240 --> 31:21.800
time, so you get a progression in weightlifting.

31:22.360 --> 31:26.440
So to do that, you don't take a brand new move and say, okay, do it on

31:26.440 --> 31:28.920
Gordon Ryan, never going to succeed.

31:29.720 --> 31:34.600
I have the athletes practice their offense on blue belts and work their way up.

31:35.920 --> 31:40.840
Defense on the other hand, you've got to start them in the deep end of the pool

31:40.920 --> 31:43.880
so that they start to see what are their vulnerabilities.

31:44.240 --> 31:44.520
Okay.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.720
So I put them with highly competitive athletes at the start so they can see,

31:47.800 --> 31:49.120
okay, there is a problem here.

31:49.440 --> 31:54.000
And then even in defense, they start off with lower belts and build

31:54.000 --> 31:55.400
up their confidence over time.

31:56.320 --> 32:03.040
So just as a weightlifter builds up his ability to lift weight over time, so

32:03.040 --> 32:08.160
to a jiu-jitsu player does it by gradually increasing resistance.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.960
Now in jiu-jitsu, resistance is not done by weight, it's done by skill level.

32:12.440 --> 32:16.160
And so over time, they started to accumulate this experience.

32:17.840 --> 32:25.320
In time, we were able to switch off and have them go against very,

32:25.320 --> 32:27.000
very tough athletes, each other.

32:27.280 --> 32:31.960
So, you know, Luke Griffith will do a full power match with Gordon Ryan.

32:32.240 --> 32:36.960
Now they're fully aware that there's no one better in the world than Gordon Ryan.

32:37.560 --> 32:43.160
So if you have a competitive match with Gordon Ryan, that's a very, very healthy sign.

32:43.600 --> 32:47.120
So they went from the start where they were being programmed going

32:47.120 --> 32:51.040
against relatively mild resistance and building up over time, and then

32:51.040 --> 32:54.520
building up to the greatest resistance possible in the sport of jiu-jitsu.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.280
And their goal is not to win, obviously, but their goal is

32:58.280 --> 33:00.520
to provide a competitive match.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.320
Now Gordon doesn't have any confidence issues.

33:03.320 --> 33:07.120
So for him, it's just good, hard, competitive training against people

33:07.120 --> 33:12.240
that are in some ways better than those you'll be facing in competition.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.320
For the other guys, it's getting a clear assessment of what their

33:16.320 --> 33:19.760
current skill level is by going against the best there is.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.800
Then we add to this a competitive schedule where the athletes have

33:23.800 --> 33:26.800
to go out into competition so they get used to the idea of performing

33:26.800 --> 33:29.400
in front of strangers on stage.

33:29.840 --> 33:35.520
Getting used to the strange elements of going out, being observed and judged

33:35.520 --> 33:38.880
by people you don't know in a performance atmosphere.

33:39.520 --> 33:44.040
And so they were all given matches and WNO competition, leading up to the

33:44.040 --> 33:50.040
event, ADCC trials, local grappling events here in Austin, and given a

33:50.040 --> 33:53.120
competitive schedule to fight and prepare them for ADCC.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.680
Obviously, as ADCC got closer and closer, this was pulled back

33:56.680 --> 33:57.920
because of the danger of injury.

33:58.520 --> 34:02.280
So within about three weeks out was the last time we had a competition.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.160
And by this method, confidence starts to grow.

34:06.640 --> 34:11.960
And so the mental preparation came out of those physical underpinnings,

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
the idea of progressive resistance increasing over time for both offense

34:17.000 --> 34:20.880
and defense, building up to a peak where they're going against the best athlete

34:20.880 --> 34:24.120
in the world so they can get an accurate assessment of where they stand.

34:24.560 --> 34:28.280
Once you're given a competitive match to the best guy in the world, you know damn

34:28.280 --> 34:31.520
well that when you go out in ADCC, you're ready to fight anybody.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.120
And defense is broadly defined.

34:34.440 --> 34:41.520
So defense in symmetrical positions, like positions like guard, and then

34:41.520 --> 34:44.400
defense also includes escaping from horrible positions.

34:44.440 --> 34:44.880
Yes.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.920
We're big believers in the idea of depth of defense.

34:47.960 --> 34:52.080
The idea that you should be able to mount defense all the way through from early

34:52.080 --> 34:57.280
stages based mostly around anticipation of identifying danger visually before it

34:57.280 --> 35:01.240
emerges and all the way through to the deepest levels of defense where you are

35:01.240 --> 35:04.600
100% defensive and terrible positions.

35:04.920 --> 35:09.600
And you have to claw your way out and over time and get back to a neutral

35:09.600 --> 35:12.480
position or even better back to an attacking position.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.880
You have an Instagram post on this topic.

35:16.000 --> 35:21.240
Um, when you get ready to step out for the biggest moment of your life, ask

35:21.240 --> 35:26.160
yourself one question, how different is this really from what I do every day?

35:26.560 --> 35:31.400
If the answer is not very different at all, then step forward with confidence

35:31.400 --> 35:35.520
and do we do every day in the same manner and ignore the hype and distraction.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.000
You're ready for action.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.840
By the way, for people who don't know, you need to follow John Donner, Donner

35:40.840 --> 35:48.440
John on Instagram, because, uh, you have nuggets or large buckets of nuggets of

35:48.440 --> 35:53.400
wisdom often, which is quite profound, even bigger than jujitsu, but anyway,

35:53.400 --> 35:58.200
so there's some aspect where you want to mimic the conditions of your daily

35:58.240 --> 36:06.760
training in, um, intensity and in what force of physical, uh, to that of the

36:06.760 --> 36:11.120
actual, uh, matches you asked the question about mental training for me.

36:11.480 --> 36:15.720
Um, the central focus of whatever small amount of mental training I give my

36:15.720 --> 36:19.040
students comes down to a very, very simple concept to understand.

36:19.640 --> 36:26.000
This is the idea of identifying competition in terms of its normalcy.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.440
Most people see training and competition is two different things.

36:31.440 --> 36:35.640
Training is normal activity that you do every day and competition is the

36:35.640 --> 36:37.320
exception, okay, it's different.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.840
You're going out, there's people watching you.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.320
There's a big crowd.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.440
They're making lots of noise.

36:42.080 --> 36:49.280
Um, in fact, the promoters of shows go out of their way to reinforce this.

36:50.040 --> 36:54.280
Look at, for example, ADCC when Gordon Ryan went to fight Andre Galvant.

36:54.320 --> 36:54.600
Okay.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.800
Do they just come out on the mat and fight each other?

36:57.320 --> 36:58.080
Absolutely not.

36:58.160 --> 37:01.960
There's both music, there's pageantry, there's fireballs.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.600
They're literally shooting fireballs.

37:03.720 --> 37:04.000
Yeah.

37:04.120 --> 37:10.960
Some dude in a tie sitting with Joe Rogan, meathead, uh, podcaster, comedian,

37:10.960 --> 37:18.360
whatever, uh, well played, but you see what they're trying to do.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.640
They're trying to create theater and pageantry when in fact, it's just a

37:21.680 --> 37:22.520
grappling match.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.880
It's just two athletes, a referee and a rule set.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.440
That's the reality.

37:28.280 --> 37:32.200
Now what they try to sell you is something which is not reality, which is

37:32.200 --> 37:33.840
this is somehow bigger and different.

37:35.440 --> 37:40.080
And they reinforce this with pageantry and theater so that it becomes not just

37:40.080 --> 37:43.200
a grappling match, but a grappling performance, the same way you have a

37:43.200 --> 37:49.360
theater performance and my goal as a coach is to dispel that and say, when you

37:49.360 --> 37:56.920
go out there, there's only one reality, you, him, and the referee reinforcing

37:56.920 --> 38:01.720
a rule set, that's it, everything else you see, the smoke, the fire, the

38:01.720 --> 38:07.080
music is an illusion and it's put there intentionally to make you feel a

38:07.080 --> 38:08.040
certain kind of way.

38:08.640 --> 38:13.160
And your whole goal is to see this as illusion and walk out and see only the

38:13.160 --> 38:18.400
reality, which is that this is the same damn thing you do every day in the gym.

38:19.360 --> 38:22.080
The only difference is you're going with a guy you've never grappled before.

38:22.640 --> 38:26.880
So the actual act of removing the illusion or realizing that it is an

38:26.880 --> 38:29.160
illusion, how do you practice that?

38:29.400 --> 38:35.240
So when you step on the mat, once you're aware of it, I always have them, it's

38:35.240 --> 38:39.640
like when you, when you see a magician and you have his tricks explained to

38:39.640 --> 38:43.680
you, you never see the magic again.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.920
The first time you see a good card trick from a good magician, it's oh my God.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.920
Then when they explain it to you, I did this, this and that step one, step two,

38:52.760 --> 38:54.880
then you look at it like, it's not that special.

38:56.800 --> 39:04.240
And when you explain to people this idea of the pageantry as an illusion, then

39:04.280 --> 39:09.160
just as when you watch the magician and you learn the trick, all the magic flies

39:09.160 --> 39:12.360
out the window, so too with the nervous response.

39:12.520 --> 39:13.600
So that's for the pageantry.

39:13.600 --> 39:17.800
But what about the, maybe the physical intensity of competition?

39:18.320 --> 39:21.400
Isn't there an extra?

39:21.720 --> 39:23.720
No, it's the same in every competition.

39:24.120 --> 39:28.640
It's not like, you know, they're twice as strong at NADCC as they are in the

39:28.640 --> 39:30.000
IBGF World Championships.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.800
They, it's the physical intensity is always pretty much the same.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.120
They experience it every day in the gym.

39:35.720 --> 39:41.200
And like, you know, if you go out and you grapple Gordon Ryan, it's not like the

39:41.200 --> 39:44.320
next guy you grapple is going to be twice as strong as him or twice as fast.

39:44.680 --> 39:48.920
It's going to be a little stronger, a little faster, but not so much so that it

39:48.920 --> 39:50.760
completely changes your approach to the game.

39:51.360 --> 39:56.000
There's not that much difference between the human bodies out there on the stage.

39:56.040 --> 39:59.920
So if you've felt intensity before, you're not going to be shocked by ADCC.

39:59.960 --> 40:04.960
But in terms of in training, do you have to try to match the intensity of competition?

40:04.960 --> 40:06.760
No, that would be foolish.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.640
You'd be, every athlete in the gym would be injured.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.880
You can do it for short periods of time.

40:11.480 --> 40:16.200
Um, but the, uh, the training has to be carefully monitored in terms of intensity

40:16.200 --> 40:20.320
levels, remember we're training seven days a week, a minimum of twice a day.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.320
Um, you, you've got to keep things under wraps.

40:24.400 --> 40:29.440
Like, you know, every other workout you can have a, like one of the five rounds

40:29.440 --> 40:33.760
can be full power, but not seven days a week, three times a day.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.600
That's, that's just going to break bodies.

40:35.680 --> 40:40.840
And the full power is just a reminder of, it's more about skill development for

40:41.360 --> 40:42.800
it always comes back to skill development.

40:42.800 --> 40:48.640
But what about matching the, the feeling of the intensity of competition?

40:49.680 --> 40:53.080
Yeah, periodically, periodically, but it can't be every single time.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.120
Not, not really.

40:54.120 --> 40:54.760
It's not rare.

40:55.120 --> 41:00.200
Like, um, meaning like, you know, one, like, uh, out of, you know, three hours

41:00.240 --> 41:06.320
of hard sparring per day, like 15 minutes might be like 100% full power.

41:06.760 --> 41:10.400
That way you, you, uh, that's more than enough to get psychologically

41:10.400 --> 41:12.080
ready for the intensity of conflict.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.200
But, um, uh, but won't break your body over time.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.680
Intensity of conflict.

41:17.680 --> 41:18.400
That's well put.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.360
There is a competition.

41:20.360 --> 41:23.080
Does, doesn't it have that extra level of animosity?

41:24.040 --> 41:26.680
Like it's a little bit more conflict than it is.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.200
It can, sometimes there's personality differences.

41:29.200 --> 41:33.120
Like, for example, like Gordon Ryan and Felipe Pena, they admire each other a lot.

41:33.120 --> 41:36.960
They respect each other's skills, but they, they certainly don't like love

41:36.960 --> 41:37.880
each other, that's for sure.

41:38.200 --> 41:43.600
So, um, uh, so there can be certain matchup where there's more intensity.

41:44.120 --> 41:48.600
Um, but then there's other matchups where the two athletes come out and

41:48.600 --> 41:52.280
it's, um, it's no more intense than a hard sparring session.

41:53.840 --> 41:57.440
So first of all, cause I would love to look at a couple of matches with you.

41:57.480 --> 42:02.840
And, uh, before that, let me say big thank you to flow grappling, uh, for first of

42:02.840 --> 42:10.000
all, helping the sport of grappling and jiu-jitsu in general, by having organized

42:11.200 --> 42:18.200
footage and, uh, tournaments that sort of show the sport in its best light to the

42:18.200 --> 42:20.000
world, and they do an incredible job of that.

42:20.240 --> 42:24.680
So if you're interested in supporting grappling as a sport, helping it grow,

42:24.680 --> 42:26.360
you should definitely support flow grappling.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.200
Go to their website, sign up also flow wrestling.

42:29.720 --> 42:30.880
I'm a huge fan of wrestling.

42:30.880 --> 42:35.680
So, um, maybe there'll be a flow judo at some point, uh, they, they don't currently,

42:35.680 --> 42:37.960
I don't think do any major judo stuff.

42:38.320 --> 42:44.880
So anyway, I, I'm a big supporter of theirs and I do have criticism that they know

42:44.880 --> 42:50.880
about, which is, uh, I hope they continue to improve on the aspect of making the

42:50.880 --> 42:55.520
footage discoverable and accessible, making it easy for you to do search through

42:55.520 --> 42:59.840
Google and on their website, to find matches, to get excited.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.640
Like if me and Joe Rogan are getting excited about a particular match, we want to

43:03.640 --> 43:05.120
be able to pull it up super quickly.

43:05.400 --> 43:10.240
Want to be able to pull up Gordon Ryan's matches super quickly from ADCC, make it

43:10.240 --> 43:15.360
super easy to show and share if we have to pay for it, fine, but make it easy.

43:15.760 --> 43:20.840
And when you sign in order to sign up for flow, it should be one click, not five

43:20.840 --> 43:22.240
clicks, it should be one click.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.200
It should be easy.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.080
Um, I think it's inexpensive.

43:26.120 --> 43:28.080
If you care about grappling is definitely worth it.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.320
You should sign up anyway.

43:29.680 --> 43:34.840
My love goes out to flow grappling and also my love goes out to Mo Jassim.

43:34.840 --> 43:38.160
As we said, uh, he's the organizer of ADCC.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.320
The next one is in 2024.

43:40.600 --> 43:42.000
It should be 2024.

43:42.080 --> 43:47.560
Well, you should follow ADCC underscore official on Instagram and just send as

43:47.560 --> 43:50.000
much love towards Mo and ADCC in general.

43:50.000 --> 43:54.240
It's the, like I said, the, the most prestigious, it's like where the best

43:54.240 --> 43:57.040
grapplers in the world show up and the magic happens.

43:57.440 --> 44:01.560
It's like some of the most historic matches in, uh, grappling and

44:01.560 --> 44:03.760
jujitsu ever happened on that stage.

44:04.440 --> 44:10.520
Uh, anyway, if I can talk about some of the interesting performances

44:10.560 --> 44:13.360
for the athletes you coach, you post that Instagram.

44:13.360 --> 44:20.200
Let's start with Gordon Ryan, Gordon Ryan, ADCC 2022, the greatest event

44:20.200 --> 44:24.720
in grappling history is over new stars emerged, established stars shown

44:24.720 --> 44:30.120
bright again, but one man stood above all like a Colossus, Gordon Ryan.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.160
You have a way with words, John Donner.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.040
Uh, I have seen many incredible feats of grappling, but I've never

44:36.040 --> 44:38.040
saw a performance like this for many.

44:38.040 --> 44:41.360
Mr. Ryan is a polarizing figure in the sport for many others

44:41.360 --> 44:42.720
and inspiration to look up to.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.920
But after this weekend, there was no disagreement amongst

44:45.920 --> 44:48.120
haters and fans about his merit.

44:48.400 --> 44:50.400
He is the best ever.

44:51.080 --> 44:54.280
It was a long and difficult journey to ADCC 2022.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.840
Just one year ago and so on.

44:56.840 --> 45:01.120
As you told the story, it was a virtuoso performance of unmatched

45:01.120 --> 45:02.960
technique, preparation and confidence.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.560
No one else can claim credit for this achievement.

45:05.960 --> 45:07.560
This was his and his alone.

45:07.800 --> 45:10.800
No one else today brings together technical depth, tactical

45:10.800 --> 45:14.840
insight and confidence to use them on stage as he does.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.120
I had many students, but only one Gordon Ryan.

45:18.360 --> 45:19.720
And I think Gordon responded.

45:19.920 --> 45:23.040
All this is true besides the credit that sits with you.

45:23.080 --> 45:23.600
Thank you.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.240
And a heart emoji.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.160
Very nice.

45:26.520 --> 45:30.080
So anyway, that's a, as a way of introduction to Gordon Ryan, can

45:30.080 --> 45:32.200
you take me through his set of performances?

45:32.720 --> 45:35.160
Um, and maybe any matches that stand out.

45:36.520 --> 45:43.960
So he competed in his division, which is the plus 99 kilos and in

45:43.960 --> 45:45.360
the super fight against Andre Gova.

45:45.520 --> 45:46.200
That's correct.

45:46.240 --> 45:50.200
Uh, this was in fact, the first time in history that this was allowed.

45:50.600 --> 45:56.400
Um, for your listeners who don't follow grappling, um, we may have been very rude

45:56.400 --> 45:59.040
and just throwing a lot of stuff at you without explaining ourselves.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.920
First of all, ADCC is like the Olympics of grappling.

46:02.040 --> 46:03.600
Uh, it occurs every two years.

46:04.040 --> 46:09.640
Um, you can either qualify for the event through, uh, winning matches

46:09.640 --> 46:12.360
and a qualification process, or you can be invited.

46:12.720 --> 46:16.640
The only people who get invited are either former winners or people in the

46:16.640 --> 46:21.280
sport who are just widely recognized superstars who bring some kind of brand

46:21.280 --> 46:25.400
value, who have proven in the past that they have what it takes to compete at

46:25.400 --> 46:35.640
that level in this format, there are two kinds of matches, there are weight

46:35.640 --> 46:41.760
division matches in which you compete against people, your own, uh, roughly

46:41.760 --> 46:42.840
your own size and weight.

46:42.840 --> 46:47.200
There is an open weight where anyone of any size can enter.

46:47.320 --> 46:50.000
So you can have very small people fighting very large people.

46:50.960 --> 46:56.440
And there is a second category called a super fight where established champions

46:56.560 --> 47:04.080
who have won previous open weight, uh, uh, tournaments fight each other in one

47:04.080 --> 47:06.120
off battles, one athlete against another.

47:06.480 --> 47:11.040
So in most of the, uh, matches you will, you will fight with one of the

47:11.080 --> 47:14.960
matches you will, you will fight repetitively over time towards a gold

47:14.960 --> 47:19.520
medal, but in one category, you fight one fight, the so-called super fight,

47:19.560 --> 47:22.080
which is usually the headline fight of the event.

47:22.840 --> 47:27.120
Um, traditionally, if you were in the super fight, you could not

47:27.400 --> 47:29.280
compete in the weight categories.

47:30.120 --> 47:34.920
It was seen as too risky because you might get injured during the weight

47:34.920 --> 47:39.480
category, or you might have to fight for very tough fights in a row and get

47:39.480 --> 47:43.720
exhausted so that you're ineffective during the main event of the, uh, of

47:43.720 --> 47:44.760
the show, the super fight.

47:45.480 --> 47:49.400
So throughout its history, ADCC has always resisted the idea of an

47:49.400 --> 47:54.200
athlete being allowed to do both weight category and a super fight.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.320
It's never happened before.

47:56.200 --> 48:00.600
Gordon Ryan requested to be able to do this, um, because of his

48:00.600 --> 48:02.680
extraordinary stature in the sport.

48:03.320 --> 48:06.200
The ADCC organization granted his request.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.040
That was the first time ever.

48:08.880 --> 48:13.080
In addition, Gordon Ryan would be fighting to be the first person to

48:13.080 --> 48:16.520
win three gold medals in three different weight categories.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.760
This has never been done before.

48:19.520 --> 48:24.800
So it was a huge event on Gordon's part and bear in mind also that prior to this

48:24.800 --> 48:31.520
event, he had fought just a month and a half earlier against a former ADCC open

48:31.520 --> 48:34.680
weight champion, Felipe Pena, who had defeated him in the past in a completely

48:34.680 --> 48:38.400
different ruleset and then previously that against the current world champion.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.360
So there had been a buildup to this.

48:40.680 --> 48:45.280
So he had been very active, uh, coming up to the event.

48:45.560 --> 48:50.240
And then he went in to fight arguably the greatest ADCC champion of all time,

48:50.280 --> 48:54.920
Andre Galvant, which would occur late on Sunday and would have to fight.

48:56.560 --> 49:01.320
The toughest people, including, uh, the possibility of fighting his

49:01.320 --> 49:06.120
nemesis, Felipe Pena, in the weight division prior to getting to the super fight.

49:06.480 --> 49:10.800
So there was genuine concern here that he may have completely overstepped himself.

49:11.360 --> 49:16.320
Um, the biggest concern I had as a coach, and I'm sure the organizers, Mo

49:16.320 --> 49:20.720
Jason must've had the same concern is that he would get injured or exhausted

49:20.760 --> 49:22.040
fighting in his weight division.

49:22.760 --> 49:28.160
Um, there were two athletes in particular, uh, Felipe Pena, who had given

49:28.160 --> 49:35.000
Gordon a very tough 40 minute match in a no rules setting, um, uh, shortly before

49:35.000 --> 49:41.800
ADCC and his former training partner, uh, Nick Rodriguez, um, who were expected to

49:41.800 --> 49:45.080
give Gordon very, very tough matches if they came up against each other.

49:46.000 --> 49:51.080
So there was a genuine concern that Gordon may burn himself out before

49:51.080 --> 49:53.880
he even got to fight the guy who most people believe is the greatest

49:53.880 --> 49:55.360
ADCC champion of all time.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.200
So our concern was how do we manage this?

49:59.800 --> 50:05.640
So what we looked for is extremely efficient methods of reducing the

50:05.640 --> 50:09.040
time of the matches, making the matches as short as possible.

50:09.800 --> 50:14.280
Um, our favorite way to fight bigger, stronger athletes.

50:14.280 --> 50:19.800
And, uh, I think Gordon was the lightest athlete in his weight division.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.760
Everyone goes, Oh, Gordon's so big and strong.

50:21.760 --> 50:22.880
It's actually quite light.

50:23.600 --> 50:27.720
Um, uh, I think he was outweighed by almost all of his opponents.

50:28.560 --> 50:32.320
It's nice to see Gordon looking small relative to his opponents,

50:32.320 --> 50:36.520
which is absurd to say, but it is the open division plus 99 kilos.

50:36.560 --> 50:37.880
It was plus 99 kilos.

50:37.880 --> 50:38.040
Right.

50:38.040 --> 50:38.520
That's what I mean.

50:38.520 --> 50:38.760
Sorry.

50:38.760 --> 50:40.800
By open plus 99 kilos.

50:40.960 --> 50:42.600
Everyone looks like the incredible Hulk.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.040
Yeah.

50:43.200 --> 50:43.520
Yeah.

50:44.120 --> 50:47.680
So, um, our big thing is when we fight bigger, stronger opponents, we

50:47.680 --> 50:49.000
always go in two directions.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.280
You either go for the legs or you go for the back.

50:51.560 --> 50:56.680
And so, um, we constructed strategies based around those two methods.

50:56.680 --> 50:57.680
So going for submissions.

50:57.680 --> 51:03.000
And we should also mention that ADCC rule set is for regular matches,

51:03.080 --> 51:06.440
I think it's five minutes and five minutes total is 10 minutes.

51:06.440 --> 51:11.720
And then for finals matches is 20 minutes and half the time is spent with no points.

51:12.440 --> 51:14.240
So these can be very, very long matches.

51:14.240 --> 51:17.640
I mean, put this in a perspective, a modern judo match is five minutes.

51:18.120 --> 51:21.880
Um, a modern wrestling match, I believe is six minutes in international freestyle.

51:22.320 --> 51:25.200
Um, so these matches can be 40 minutes long.

51:25.560 --> 51:28.200
Now that's a long, long grappling match.

51:28.480 --> 51:32.560
And, um, depending on how you compete in it, that can have a huge toll.

51:32.560 --> 51:33.200
Absolutely.

51:33.240 --> 51:36.600
You can, you can get to the finals and just be absolutely spent.

51:37.080 --> 51:39.760
So our whole thing is, okay, Gordon's got to not only get to the finals,

51:39.760 --> 51:43.040
then he's got to fight the toughest ADCC grappler of all time after that.

51:43.440 --> 51:48.560
So, um, we were looking for quick and energy efficient matches, and that

51:48.560 --> 51:50.680
meant go into the back or go into the legs.

51:51.160 --> 51:54.920
Um, and in the overwhelming majority of cases, that's exactly what he did.

51:54.920 --> 51:59.240
He was able to get some very, very quick matches, uh, courtesy of leg lock

51:59.240 --> 52:04.200
finishes and in the few cases where he, uh, uh, didn't finish on legs, then he

52:04.200 --> 52:05.760
would simply take his opponent's back.

52:06.240 --> 52:10.720
And, uh, that's a very low stress position to, to occupy.

52:11.160 --> 52:14.960
Um, in one case, uh, his opponent deliberately kept his back on the ground

52:14.960 --> 52:18.800
to prevent the backtake and they just, uh, chose mounted position instead.

52:19.120 --> 52:22.600
And so he was able to go through his weight division with extremely low

52:22.600 --> 52:27.680
energy expenditure, which set him up well to go into the, uh, the finals.

52:27.680 --> 52:30.000
No injuries, very little energy expenditure.

52:30.480 --> 52:35.280
Now it sounds easy to say that, you know, okay, the strategy worked, but in order

52:35.280 --> 52:39.840
to get that strategy to work, you have to have one hell of a set of skills.

52:40.200 --> 52:44.480
And, um, uh, and we can see those now.

52:44.480 --> 52:48.520
Would you like to, yeah, I would love to go through them and, uh, I should also

52:48.520 --> 52:52.160
mention for people just listening to this, we'll, I'll try to commentate on

52:52.160 --> 52:57.640
different things we'll look at, but the thing that was made clear is, uh, maybe

52:57.640 --> 53:05.200
you can speak to that, maybe to you, it looks like efficiency, but to me, it

53:05.200 --> 53:08.200
looked like a Gordon was not even trying.

53:08.560 --> 53:13.360
There was a, um, a relaxed aspect to the whole thing.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.680
So maybe it had to do with saving energy, but he made it look very easy

53:17.360 --> 53:20.600
and he made the path to submission look very easy.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.840
So here, the first match against an opponent that again, looks bigger than him.

53:26.800 --> 53:27.160
Okay.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.160
I'll just give an initial comment here.

53:29.320 --> 53:33.520
Um, first you'll see that Gordon elected to sit to the bottom position.

53:33.680 --> 53:38.960
Um, the hardest work in submission grappling is when two athletes take

53:38.960 --> 53:42.760
the standing position and joust for takedowns, uh, that's where most

53:42.760 --> 53:43.960
of the energy gets burned up.

53:44.280 --> 53:48.200
So working on the idea of energy efficiency, let's go out and we, we

53:48.200 --> 53:51.680
chose to sit into guard position and then start looking to access our

53:51.680 --> 53:55.120
opponent's back because of our opponent's head position, a far side arm

53:55.120 --> 53:56.200
drag makes a lot of sense.

53:56.200 --> 53:58.680
Gordon is able to beat the arm and quickly get behind his opponent.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.760
Now the question is going to be getting into a scoring position.

54:01.760 --> 54:05.720
It's too early to score at this point, but we're just concerned at this stage

54:05.720 --> 54:08.400
of just energy expenditure and make the other guy work harder than us.

54:08.440 --> 54:12.520
So, uh, Gordon did arm drag to the back and I was working on the hooks.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.680
Um, the hooks are not particularly important here.

54:15.680 --> 54:19.560
He'll use it just to get stability on his opponent, but, um, interestingly

54:19.560 --> 54:23.720
his opponent here had an interesting strategy too, which was to occupy

54:23.800 --> 54:30.360
bottom turtle position and, uh, and look to get to the critical five point

54:30.400 --> 54:33.960
demarcate, sorry, a five minute demarcation point where points

54:33.960 --> 54:35.320
began, begin to get scored.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.520
His, uh, his idea, I believe I'm speculating here based on his actions

54:38.880 --> 54:43.440
was to keep Gordon at bay in a defensive turtle position until a five minute

54:43.440 --> 54:47.960
mark occurred, in which case he would shake Gordon off, walk away and

54:47.960 --> 54:49.400
force a takedown battle.

54:49.840 --> 54:52.160
How many people are comfortable in that?

54:52.160 --> 54:55.040
And what do you think about the defensive turtle position versus

54:55.040 --> 54:56.440
always trying to come back to guard?

54:57.080 --> 54:59.240
Turtle position is the second bottom position of units.

54:59.400 --> 55:02.960
Many people only associate guard position with bottom position and

55:02.960 --> 55:04.720
you did see that's, that's naive.

55:04.760 --> 55:08.040
There's two, there's guard position and turtle position.

55:08.440 --> 55:14.840
Now as a general rule, guard position offers a much, much greater variety of

55:14.880 --> 55:20.320
attacking options than turtle position does, um, but that's not to say

55:20.320 --> 55:25.920
turtle position absolutely can be, uh, uh, an effective bottom position.

55:25.920 --> 55:27.480
You can work effectively from there.

55:27.840 --> 55:32.240
So there's some case to be made that to wait out five minutes, turtle might be.

55:32.280 --> 55:35.960
I mean, I personally think it against Gordon Ryan.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.760
I mean, I admire the fellow's courage.

55:37.800 --> 55:40.240
I, um, it's not easy.

55:40.560 --> 55:42.880
Um, but there was a logic to what he was doing.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.840
Uh, people think, oh, he just got his back taken so easily, but

55:46.080 --> 55:47.920
they, he did have a strategy.

55:48.120 --> 55:51.000
Now, did he pick the right person to use that strategy against?

55:51.000 --> 55:51.760
Probably not.

55:52.160 --> 55:57.760
Um, so Gordon is able to, uh, break the turtle down, get one hook in.

55:59.880 --> 56:06.160
At which point, uh, is, is this becoming an extremely controlling position with

56:06.160 --> 56:10.920
Gordon in the back at which point is there, are you happy with where it is?

56:10.920 --> 56:13.840
At this point, uh, it just started to dawn on me at this point, this

56:13.840 --> 56:18.400
guy actually had a strategy, which was to maintain a prone position that he's in

56:18.400 --> 56:21.960
now and then shake Gordon off after the five minute mark.

56:22.320 --> 56:28.080
So, um, uh, once that became obvious, then I was, uh, now I'm starting to

56:28.080 --> 56:29.560
look at the clock and how close we are.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.000
If we can take it up to five minutes.

56:35.560 --> 56:38.000
Right now, this guy's only intention is to stop Gordon from

56:38.000 --> 56:39.280
strangling him and finish.

56:39.280 --> 56:39.920
Okay.

56:39.920 --> 56:42.320
Now the guy's trying to go up in vertical, uh, freeze it there.

56:42.520 --> 56:46.080
Now, do you see how he's taking his elbows off the mat and turtle position?

56:46.400 --> 56:48.760
And you did see, there's only one reason you take your elbows off the

56:48.760 --> 56:49.560
mat from turtle position.

56:49.560 --> 56:50.440
That's the stand up.

56:50.560 --> 56:53.920
So now it's, it's clear at this point, what his actual strategy is.

56:53.920 --> 56:57.600
It's to get up, force a standing confrontation, win a takedown battle

56:57.600 --> 56:58.840
and beat Gordon by points.

56:58.880 --> 57:00.120
So he did have a strategy.

57:00.440 --> 57:03.160
Now, the guy's trying to go up in vertical, uh, freeze it there.

57:03.360 --> 57:07.080
Now, do you see how he's taking his elbows off the mat and turtle position?

57:07.440 --> 57:08.760
So he did have a strategy.

57:09.160 --> 57:12.880
Now our counter strategy is always based around the power half Nelson.

57:12.880 --> 57:14.760
This is a common move in the sport of wrestling.

57:15.080 --> 57:17.760
And it's a great way to break people down as they try to stand up.

57:18.720 --> 57:19.400
So heavy.

57:19.400 --> 57:19.800
Yeah.

57:19.960 --> 57:21.960
I mean, Gordon is a master of it.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.040
And so there's a power half Nelson that Gordon has on him as the, as the

57:26.360 --> 57:28.920
elbows are off the ground and knees are off the ground.

57:28.920 --> 57:30.640
He's going to return his opponent to the mat.

57:31.120 --> 57:33.160
And as you can see, he's successful in doing so.

57:33.520 --> 57:36.000
And now it's clear what demand strategy is.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.080
So I'm calling to Gordon to break him down to a hip.

57:38.120 --> 57:40.040
You put a man on a hip, he can't stand up.

57:40.640 --> 57:44.080
Gordon successfully does it traps the shoulder using that one-on-one grip

57:44.080 --> 57:46.360
with his right hand, puts them down to a shoulder and a hip.

57:46.400 --> 57:49.120
That means standing up is no longer an option for his opponent.

57:49.640 --> 57:53.000
Now Gordon goes in, he's already scoring because of the, uh, the

57:53.000 --> 57:55.040
turtle position that he's in his shoulders.

57:55.160 --> 57:56.680
His opponent stays down on his shoulder.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.760
Now Gordon's responsibilities start looking for the stranglehold.

58:00.120 --> 58:02.320
His opponent has basic defensive structure.

58:02.320 --> 58:04.400
His discipline with his chin keeps the chin down.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.480
Gordon is a master of tying up defensive arms and penetrating under

58:08.480 --> 58:13.880
the chin to get to a strangle and you'll see that shortly is the trapping of the arm.

58:15.560 --> 58:19.880
Notice that no advanced, uh, uh, grips were required.

58:19.880 --> 58:21.240
It was just a spontaneous trap.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.720
There's the penetration of the neck.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.280
So the arm was trapped with the leg.

58:25.520 --> 58:25.760
Yep.

58:26.080 --> 58:29.360
So now he's only got one defensive arm and he's just taking that away

58:29.360 --> 58:32.080
with his left hand and he gets a one-handed strangle for the finish.

58:35.040 --> 58:39.600
And it looks like not much energy was expanded during that process.

58:39.840 --> 58:40.120
Yeah.

58:40.200 --> 58:44.360
So that's a, as the tournament got off to a very smooth start, very little

58:44.360 --> 58:47.760
energy expenditure, no injuries and a submission win.

58:48.560 --> 58:54.400
Does that, there's a kind of certain look to Gordon of that

58:54.400 --> 58:56.120
could be interpreted as nervousness.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.000
That was an incorrect interpretation.

58:58.120 --> 58:58.560
Yes.

58:58.680 --> 58:58.960
Okay.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.600
So there's a, uh,

59:02.560 --> 59:05.000
what do you interpret as nervous behavior?

59:05.680 --> 59:12.560
Well, this is, um, part of me is trolling, but sometimes on the surface,

59:12.720 --> 59:22.400
confident behavior can look like, uh, almost like anger and there's, um, uh,

59:24.080 --> 59:26.880
Gordon's face had like a vulnerability to it.

59:27.520 --> 59:31.960
Almost like, uh, when you go to judge confidence, don't look at the face.

59:32.960 --> 59:34.600
Look at the extremities of the body.

59:34.800 --> 59:35.120
Yeah.

59:35.680 --> 59:37.000
That's where the truth comes out.

59:37.360 --> 59:40.480
You see it in body language and the further from the face and chest, the

59:40.480 --> 59:42.000
more honest the body becomes.

59:42.800 --> 59:44.200
Look at the feet and the hands.

59:45.600 --> 59:48.520
What they were, I mean, that's when you'll see if people are nervous or not.

59:48.920 --> 59:52.360
He was very relaxed, uh, in the extremities.

59:52.560 --> 59:53.120
That's true.

59:53.600 --> 59:57.280
See, you look more confident in this than anything.

59:57.600 --> 59:58.840
What, what are you thinking about?

59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.240
What are you, what, uh, what's going through your head here?

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.560
Uh, is this the same stuff?

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:08.560
Are you, are you intimidated by the, the two meatheads, one in a suit and tie,

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.440
or do you not thinking about that at all?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.760
I know, uh, for me, it's just about, okay, what's the most efficient path to victory

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.240
against this particular opponent.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.120
It says, okay, I've done my job.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:24.400
I've taken them through a, um, uh, an extensive fight camp that prepared them

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:29.160
for every conceivable situation that they're in, uh, I've run an efficient

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.960
warmup, their body temperature is perfect.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.080
The elasticity in the muscles is perfect.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:41.600
Um, my main role when I corner is I avoid what most people do when they

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.040
corner, which is to be a cheerleader.

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.560
Most corner men, they're not corner men.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.280
They're cheerleaders.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:49.480
They're there to express some kind of emotional support to their training

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.280
partners or their student.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.120
Sometimes they're, they're even worse than cheerleaders.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:59.800
They express their own emotional fears as the match goes on.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:08.000
Um, I always believe that 99.5% of the job of the trainer is done.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.600
The coach is done when the athlete steps their foot on the mat.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:16.280
At that point, you shouldn't need me at all.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.760
Everything I needed to tell you should have been not just told

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.960
to you, but imprinted into you.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.800
Remember there's 15,000 people in that crowd for half of the match.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:30.200
You're not going to hear a word that I can say, there's too much noise, but

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:36.080
you'll hear my voice inside your head because you've heard it so many times

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.680
over the last 14 weeks, you're sick of hearing it at that point and their

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.040
program know what to do.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.560
Um, so I'm, I'm usually, uh, pretty confident.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.680
I'm also very confident that even in worst case scenarios, they can have

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.600
effective solutions because they train those worst case scenarios every

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.680
single day in the gym.

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:04.640
And so in part, you're there to have a front row seat to analyze what happened

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.040
so that you can take that to the next match.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.800
The biggest danger an athlete faces is tunnel vision.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:15.440
Sometimes they will hit upon a certain move or strategy and just say, I'm

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.280
going to go with this when there's much easier alternatives, but because they're

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.000
so focused on the alternative they've chosen, they get this tunnel vision

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.280
and just focus only on that.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.680
The most constructive thing the corner man can do is alert them to the presence

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.800
of time, which is very important in an ADCC match because they're all the

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:38.080
scoring is structured by time and to alleviate problems associated with tunnel

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.960
vision that, okay, you're doing this, but if you just did this, it'd be so much

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.360
easier.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.120
So that's the main goal.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:52.040
So here, uh, this was one of several anticipated matches against a second

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.080
one against Victor Hugo, which is a very tough opponent.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:02.360
And, uh, again, this was a situation where Gordon was considerably outweighed

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.120
by his opponents.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.000
So the main thing here was efficiency.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.680
His opponent elected to avoid the standing position by jumping into God.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.040
So now Gordon would be in top position this time.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.160
He has a very good close guard, but unfortunately Gordon has very good

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:17.960
guard passing.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:22.720
So, um, uh, he, he's an excellent guard player, very talented, but, uh, Gordon

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:27.280
is renowned as the eminent God pastor in the world today.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:32.200
So, um, it's a tall order to hold Gordon off for a 10 minute match.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.280
Is there something you can say about this guard passing?

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.840
Gordon is making it look very easy.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.000
It's middle distance guard passing here.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.600
Um, and he eventually passes to Mount, I believe in a very, uh,

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.880
again, when you run through the sequence where he gets mounted, this, uh, there's

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.640
a couple, I believe he gets mounted twice.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.840
There's some, uh, just back just a little bit further.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.120
Yeah.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.040
So he's trying to one, one arm under.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.080
Yeah, this is a stacking position.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.040
Now, normally we always insist on the idea of getting an

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.040
advantageous angle first, controlling the feet and getting angle.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.600
Um, but there's a height advantage that Victor Hugo has here and the length of

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:16.240
his legs, um, means that, uh, he can play very, very wide with his legs.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.760
So getting an advantageous angle might be difficult in these circumstances.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.600
It often makes sense to go right up the middle.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:28.560
Um, now Gordon could just go back for legs because the legs, Victor Hugo's

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:32.440
legs are so far apart at this point that, uh, you could easily isolate a leg and

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.920
attack that, but Gordon wanted to, uh, to show off his passing prowess.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.000
Very often he'll go into a match and to say, okay, I'm going to, I'm

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.120
going to show this skill.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.440
And he'll often use it as a demonstration of, um, techniques he

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.640
teaches in instructional videos.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.080
So he wanted to show that he could pass them out readily on a world champion.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.120
Like this part here, this little step.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:55.560
Okay.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.720
Uh, just freeze it right there.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.600
Go back one step.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:58.440
Okay.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:03.840
You can clearly see that all of his opponent's defensive frames are built

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.480
on his opponent's left-hand side.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:10.200
So everything is defense on the, on the left, but you can see this comes at a

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.200
price and that price is back exposure on the right-hand side.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.800
You can literally see his opponent's back on that side.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:21.440
So Gordon's whole, uh, game is to, to place sufficient pressure that you, the

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.960
opponent overcompensates on the side of pressure just to set up a quick switch

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.160
across to the other side.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.400
There's the vulnerability, there's the back exposure.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.840
His opponent has to put his back on the ground, switches back.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.040
That's a world champion right there on bottom who does a good job of recovering

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.320
from the first danger, but unfortunately Gordon has been here a thousand times

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.000
and just switches his hips and kicks out.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.040
And so you see there's two changes in direction left, right, in a very short

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.320
period of time that people find very, very hard to keep up with.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.720
Now his opponent builds up to an elbow.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.840
He's looking to create more and more space from here.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.840
But Gordon counters by just stepping over the hips.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:04.480
It's just when you feel like every move, he's doing the right things.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.880
The man on bottom is doing well.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.080
He's doing the right things, but the other guy's just been here too many times

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:16.160
and it's just a half second ahead of every decision going up in the elbow.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.440
Gordon makes it look so easy here with the, it's, it almost seems like a

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:31.440
victory is out, but this turning of the hips with a arm over the opponent's

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:35.360
back, he's able to bring them back down and get in Gordon takes mount.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:42.880
Notice how Gordon is never satisfied with the mounted position itself.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.000
He's only satisfied with an extended mounted position where the elbow

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.400
comes up over the shoulder line.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:48.400
Yeah.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:52.480
Only then does he show there's a, there's a little bit of relief right there.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:52.840
Right.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:53.800
Right.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.640
There's a little bit of relief.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.680
No, that's, that's the look of a man who's just proved a point.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.960
Uh, this is very Michael Jordan like sticks his tongue out.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.520
So yeah, I mean, there's no points at this stage.

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.920
He really is going for submission.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.960
And then this, this happens again.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:28.840
Is this the match that wasn't Gordon was the only match where Gordon didn't, uh,

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.600
finish his opponent by submission.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.400
Was this very frustrating for him?

01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:40.480
Was there, uh, it's actually interesting that when he came off the mat, um, uh, he

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.160
was visibly frustrated.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.440
He wanted to, to, uh, to get a finish.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:51.560
And, um, I think he was more upset about not finishing Victor Hugo than he was

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.600
delighted by winning his two gold medals.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.240
Um, uh, so I think that says a lot about the perfectionism of Gordon Ryan.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:05.120
Most people would be thrilled to beat one of the great grapplers of this

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:10.880
generation decisively in this fashion, but he was, uh, he was not happy.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.880
And so this is a Gordon's third match against, uh, Sousa was about Sousa.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.280
Now this is another guy who's very big, uh, different because now

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.560
we're onto the second day.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.240
Um, your listeners should be aware that the event occurs over a two day period.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.640
So the previous two matches occurred on Saturday and now we're into Sunday.

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.680
Now this puts a different context on things.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.520
If we could just freeze it right there, maybe go back once there.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.160
Um, now we're on Sunday morning and the idea is that Gordon will be

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.440
fighting the biggest fight of his life late that afternoon.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.680
So now we're into the idea of energy conservation.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:47.400
Okay.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:50.680
It's okay to have two hard matches on, on Saturday because you get

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.840
to rest on Saturday night.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.560
But now Gordon has to beat two people back to back and save energy for the

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.680
biggest fight of his life on Sunday, uh, late Sunday afternoon.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.760
So now the emphasis is on a quick win.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.840
And you can see Gordon Ryan certainly delivers on this.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:13.400
Now, when you go to entangle your opponent's legs, the basic choice you

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:19.840
have is between straight Ashigarami and cross Ashigarami, um, in the last five

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.240
years, cross Ashigarami has proven to be statistically the more important of the

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:31.200
two, um, and as a result, many people have forgotten the value of straight

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:36.600
Ashigarami leg based leg locks and, uh, uh, undervalued them.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.560
Uh, Gordon has outstanding heel hooks from both straight and cross positions.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:47.000
And his opponent was probably more concerned about the danger of a cross

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.520
Ashigarami left the, the, uh, the right leg, uh, undefended for far too long.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:59.000
And as a result, Gordon goes into a very classical Ashigarami you would normally

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.600
expect to see from five or six years ago and gets a very, very quick finish.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.880
So lifts his opponent.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.680
There's the Ashigarami, the entanglement of one of his opponent's legs were two of

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.920
his, now he's got to turn and expose his opponent's heel.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.440
So there's an initial off balance to the left to get a defensive reaction.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.520
The opponent overcompensates, exposes his heel, and then there's the submission.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.760
There's a danger of a leg being broken here.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:31.640
Gordon has a absolutely ferocious, uh, outside heel hook until you felt it.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.720
It's, um, it's quite different.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:38.720
So the, the opponent, probably before he even felt the heel hook felt the

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.440
control and that it's screwed that he's screwed there.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:47.200
He doesn't even want to, when someone has someone who knows what they're doing,

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.160
gets a bite on your leg like that.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.080
You feel it deep inside your knee and ankle tendons immediately.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:00.720
And, um, uh, it's, there's a sense in which you almost tap,

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.920
uh, he got a couple of taps, almost, almost like as if they're early.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.280
Because the opponent knows.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:09.240
People came up to us, obviously this guy tapped early.

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:15.080
He's like, no, he knew, he knew that, uh, late would be a big problem.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:16.480
Got it.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.760
So this is within, within, within like 30 seconds, within 10 seconds.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.000
I think it was within 10 seconds.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.880
So this was an excellent example of someone saying, okay, I'm going to

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.480
conserve energy with a short match.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.400
I'm not just going to go down into a neutral position.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.400
I'm going to directly pull into a leg lock attack from standing position.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.400
You don't see that much in heavyweight divisions.

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.440
That's something you see more in the lightweight divisions.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.480
So we've got to go to the final match of, uh, of Gordon's within his division,

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:51.920
which I think, um, as opposed to, uh, facing Felipe Pena who lost to Nikki rod.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:57.760
He's got a great match against Felipe Pena, um, uh, and, uh,

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.240
passed Felipe Pena's guard.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.400
I think only the second person in ADCC competition to accomplish that, I

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.600
believe with a, with a body lock, uh, it started as a body lock, but he

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.000
converted to half guard top head and arm and, uh, passed out of half guard

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.160
top chest to chest.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.400
I think I listened to, uh, uh, Craig Jones sort of interview summarizing

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.320
what happened to ADCC and he briefly mentioned that, uh, Nikki Robb might

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.200
have the best body lock pass that he's ever felt.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:30.200
So like the way to face Nikki rod is don't get them.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.280
Don't let them get the body lock.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:35.080
But there's a problem if you, if you stand up, he's a good wrestler.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.320
So there's a, there's a dilemma there.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:40.320
Like you have to sit down to God, but that goes into his body lock.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.640
But then if you stand up, now you go into his wrestling skills.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.320
So it's a great dilemma that he has.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:55.080
And that's what, uh, in, in facing and facing, uh, Nikki rod going

01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:03.960
here chooses to, um, yeah, if you look at the limbs, there's a relaxation there.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.360
We should also explain some things here.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.920
Uh, this is a finals match.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:11.520
So instead of being 10 minutes long, it's 20 minutes long with the

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.880
option of a, a 20 minute overtime.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.080
So this could potentially be a 40 minute match.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.920
So you can see why the ADCC people were very concerned about

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.480
Gordon doing this match.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.720
Because what if, what if this match had gone 40 minutes and then an exhausted

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:29.400
Gordon Ryan has to go out to fight Andre Galvant who's fresh and, and ready to

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.560
maul him and the top of that is former two former teammates who know each other's

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:36.680
game very well, so there was a high likelihood in most people's minds that

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.400
this would go the distance.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.320
Cause you know, when you train with each other for years, every single day in

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.520
the gym, seven days a week, you get to know each other's tricks.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:51.560
Um, one big problem here for Nikki rod is that, uh, his body lock guard

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:57.200
passing game, which is his main weapon on the ground was taught to him by us.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.200
So it's not like we're going to be taken by surprise by it.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.680
So that, that must've been figuring in his mind.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.040
Do you think, uh, psychologically for Gordon and psychologically for

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.960
Nikki rod, it's tough for him with that body lock, for example, do you think

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.600
it's tough for him to know what to do here?

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.960
Uh, it's tough because he would have remembered the outcome of the training

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:26.200
sessions, it's hard to go up against the guy who used to dominate you in

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.240
training and then say, okay, I'm going to beat him in competition.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.720
But can you shut all of that off?

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.440
Because memory is memory.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.080
You can't lie to yourself.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.440
Well, what do you think about competition sort of there?

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.680
There's been a lot of Olympics, bring this out.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.640
There's been a lot of big upsets at the Olympics.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.960
There's something where people find something in them.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.320
I mean, judo is a, is a different sport and grappling in judo.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:15:01.000
There's much more room for upset because a mistake in judo will have ramifications

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.920
that will be felt within half a second.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:06.000
Like if you get, if you take the wrong grip in judo, you can be

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.600
thrown in half a second and there's no recovery.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.480
If your two shoulders hit the mat with momentum, it's over, it's done.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:17.640
Um, in jujitsu, you could, especially in ADCC, where there's no points

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.120
in the first five minutes, you could get taken down and mounted by

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.120
your opponent and still win.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:28.640
Like you can recover from a bad start in judo, boxing, kickboxing, MMA.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.520
You get hit, there's no recovery time.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.720
You just get swarmed on.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.960
And, um, jujitsu is a much more forgiving sport where you can make a series of

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.520
blunders and you just recover from them.

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.160
You don't make a series of blunders in boxing, you're unconscious.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.080
So that there's the blunder case, but there's also been just

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.680
people where it's their day.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.160
I mean, again, maybe it's romanticizing the notion, but there's been some

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.160
epic performances in wrestling, in Olympic wrestling, in Olympic judo.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.200
As an example, Satoshi Ishii, he had a 2008 performance.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.160
We talked about the All Japan and all that kind of stuff, but the Olympics,

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:10.040
he destroyed, uh, everybody on this path to the Olympic gold medal.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.600
And that's when Teddy Reneiro was also competing.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.480
He got the bronze.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.720
So, I mean, that, and you could say he was at that time, the best in the world

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:25.960
also, but he, I mean, I say, yeah, but I think it would be very fair to say he

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:26.960
was the best in the world.

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:30.920
I think about the people he beat to win three All Japan championships.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.880
Like he beat Kosei Inoue, uh, he beat Keiji Suzuki.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.400
They were Olympic champions.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:38.160
Like he was already.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.680
So you don't believe in free will?

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.040
I don't believe that a person can walk on stage and be better than what

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:47.880
they are supposed to be.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.320
You, you have a skill level at set in stone.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.280
This is your skill level.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.200
You don't just go on stage and suddenly your skill level gets here.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.280
What you do have is a situation where you have a skill level.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.120
Okay.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.680
Another opponent has a higher skill level, but he runs into confidence

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.000
issues so that he only uses a small percentage of his actual skills.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:13.760
And then he will fall below someone who is technically lower on the skill

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:19.680
scale than he is that can happen, but you can't just magically acquire skills.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.040
Yeah.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.440
But all of us are able to fall in confidence.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:23.920
Yes.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.400
So the question becomes who manages that fall best and that

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.560
can create upsets.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.240
Absolutely.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.120
So you don't think Gordon could have fallen in confidence

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.800
against a former teammate when the pressure is so high?

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.840
There was just no basis for a fall to occur.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.320
You said he doesn't have confidence issues.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.880
Is what do you attribute that to?

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.760
That's because he never loses in the gym.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.760
There's, there's nothing in the, there's no experience that he's had that would

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.960
make him say, I shouldn't be this confident.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.400
So it's the physical, it's like, like we talked about mental preparation.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.080
Hey, don't get me wrong.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.400
If Gordon lost 20 matches in a row, of course his confidence would drop

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.480
because experience is now, there's, there's going to be a psychological

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:11.640
dissonance between his experience, his recent experience and what he believes.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:12.440
Okay.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.760
If you believe you're the best in the world, you just lost 20 matches.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.520
At some point reality is going to break in.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.600
But if you're just never losing in competition, dominating people in the

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:27.840
gym, then there's nothing in your experience that would shake your confidence.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.480
Can I ask you this just in a small tangent?

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:32.400
Why is Gordon Ryan so good?

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.600
So we're looking at, you've trained a lot of special athletes.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.800
You're a special human being yourself.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.440
I could just look at human history.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.440
There's a lot of, not a lot.

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.360
There's some special humans.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.320
It seems like Gordon Ryan is one of them.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.080
I totally agree with that.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.520
Can you try to like dissect?

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:55.880
That's what I meant when I said I had many students, but only one Gordon Ryan.

01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:00.040
Like I've taught many, many people, but they don't all have his skill level.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.080
So there's an obvious elephant in the room here.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:02.360
Okay.

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:05.160
What distinguishes him from, from other athletes?

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.000
Great question.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.920
I'll try and give an answer.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.920
More than anyone else that I've ever taught, he has a memory for

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.120
things that were taught to him.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.360
He has an ability to recall information that is extraordinary compared

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.360
with other people in the room.

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.880
So that's definitely a big part of it.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:40.120
Secondly, he has a pride in technique and technical prowess that will not

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:45.080
allow him to settle for anything less than perfection and he will hate

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.520
himself when there is imperfection.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.680
So there is a love of excellence and a hatred of anything less than excellence.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:20:01.960
He has an ability to pull the trigger when opportunity arises,

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.560
which is truly extraordinary.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:10.880
Many people know what to do, but when the moment comes, they back off

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.080
and they'll doubt themselves.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.320
If Gordon sees the opportunity, the trigger pulls every time.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:22.000
There's a few times where he gets a little bit of an advantage and he just

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.800
chases it to get a big, like, uh, with Andre Gavau, you know, you get, it's

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:32.280
like, uh, there's a dance and you get one step ahead and he's able to chase

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:36.040
that, you know, get a little glimmer of the back and he's able to chase

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.480
that all the way to back control.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.240
So that, that is the thing that he's able to do.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.360
And he's able to do that.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:45.040
He's able to, he's able to, he's able to, he's able to, he's able to

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:45.840
back control.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.080
So that, that is that kind of the trigger that you're referring to?

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:49.760
Yes.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.440
It runs deeper than that too.

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.520
It's the idea that good athletes are greedy athletes.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:55.880
Okay.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:00.640
When they see a small opportunity, they try and get a, as big a bite of it as

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:04.080
possible so that the mantra that we always have in training, if you can see

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.400
the back, you can take the back.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.640
And if Gordon sees an inch of your back, you know, that's the

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.880
direction he's going to be going.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.760
If your far shoulder is within an inch of the floor, he's going to be mounting

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:19.200
you, uh, if your shoulder comes off the floor, he'd be on your back on the other

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.680
side, um, he's a maximalist with opportunity.

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:27.920
He's not satisfied with, Oh, let me get a good enough outcome.

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.320
It's like, I want the maximal outcome.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:33.760
So when you combine all these things together and ability to recall

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.760
information, which is just far superior to anyone else I've ever

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:46.280
coached, um, an ability to work in the training room towards not just

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.600
good technique, but excellent technique.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:55.920
The confidence to pull the trigger whenever the opportunity arises, a

01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:02.320
maximalist mindset where it's never enough to have a good enough outcome.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.360
It's always got to be the best possible outcome.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:14.160
And the fifth element, which I believe is very, very important is extraordinary

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:21.880
depth in his technical prowess, in particular, with regards his defensive

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:26.560
acumen, everyone looks at Gordon and focuses on his offensive prowess

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.960
because they see him dominate other athletes.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.800
But what they don't see is what I see every day in the gym where he works

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.800
from impossibly bad defensive position.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:41.040
Someone locked in on a full heel hook on his body and a full jiu-jitsu

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:47.760
tamayama in a complete pin mounted with Gordon's two arms stretched out over

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.880
his head and what looks like a hopeless position and Gordon will wheeze

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.480
and he'll be like, Oh, I'm going to go for this, I'm going to go for this.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:23:00.240
And what looks like a hopeless position and Gordon will work in these positions.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.720
And of course, because it's such a bad position, sometimes he'll have to tap,

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.440
but he just works so relentlessly in these bad positions that when he

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:17.080
steps on stage, he say, if this guy got the worst possible position on me,

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:19.080
there's nothing he could do with it.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.200
And within 30 seconds, I could turn it around on him and win this match.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:34.040
That gives his game an overall breadth and depth, which is very, very hard to deal with.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.920
It means there's no obvious weak point where you can just say, okay, I'm going

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.320
to attack him here and use this strategy to beat him.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:52.400
And that goes back to his confidence that the reason why most people

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.880
lack confidence is because they fear bad outcomes.

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:56.480
Okay.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:02.640
If you're a strong guard player, you've got an excellent guard, but you're

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.560
terrified of leg locks and your opponent has strong leg locks, you will shut down

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:12.080
your own guard and won't play as freely and well as you normally do because

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.320
you're afraid of the leg lock danger.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.800
You'll pull your feet in, you'll play a very conservative guard game.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:25.920
But if you had extremely adept leg lock defense, then you just play with all

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:28.960
the, uh, the confidence you normally do from, from, from guard position.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.280
Um, Gordon puts himself in that situation.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:38.360
He's so defensively sound that it translates into his offensive confidence.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.200
When you talk about memory recall, which is interesting, I can't help

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.560
but see parallels between him and, uh, Magnus Carlsen, who's a chess player,

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:53.120
who's the number one in the world, the arguably the best ever, certainly the

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.320
best ever, if you just look at absolute numbers, the chess has the luxury of

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.240
having a rating, uh, which you can't have it cannot have in jujitsu because

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.440
it's a game of human chess.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.120
Chess is just a board game.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:08.080
So you can actually calculate the probability that you could win.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.120
So he is the highest ELO rating, uh, ever.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:12.680
And he's maintained that rating.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.600
He can, without competing against the number two in the world, he can just

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.120
prove that he's the number one in the world for many years.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.400
Uh, anyway, there's us certain similarities.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.040
One is ability to recall.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:31.160
So memory recall of information is fascinatingly good.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:35.120
And the other one is not so much a love for perfection, which is something you

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.680
mentioned, but the flip side of that, which is what you also mentioned is

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.840
the hate of imperfection.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:48.920
Uh, now in the case of Magnus, it almost, uh, creates a level of

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:52.600
anxiety for him that's almost destructive.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:59.000
So the thing he seems to hate the most is imperfection against people

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.520
he knows are worse than him.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:06.360
So the thing he loves is competing against people that are close to skill

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:11.600
level or the favorite is people who are, might actually be better than him,

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.240
especially in certain positions.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.760
He loves competing against them.

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.880
He hates competing against people that are, um, still from the perspective of

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.040
everyone else, uh, what are called super grandmasters.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.760
So top three in the world, but he knows he's much better than them.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.960
And the anxiety of being not perfect against those people.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.040
That's why, that's why he, I don't know if you're paying attention,

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.280
but he stepped away.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:41.360
He's not going to defend his world championship, uh, because he hates

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.520
the anxiety of playing people worse than him.

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:44.640
Interesting.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.960
He figures they would somehow make him look bad.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:53.960
No, he just, for him, at least the language he uses is just not fun.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.920
And he likes having fun.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:57.920
It's to him.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.360
It was fun to win no matter the skill level, the world championship the first

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:11.000
time, but then defending it is a very grueling process is, um, with classical

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.440
chess, you play these many hours, it could be seven hour long games.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:20.960
And, uh, on, on top of that, he really hates the fact that it's only, I

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.560
forget what it is, but it's single digit number of games.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.960
He says it's, it's low sample.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:34.080
So, um, I can't, uh, I would, I would like to play 20, 30, 40, 50 games

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.520
if we're going to do it this way.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.800
But then they're too long.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.120
It's going to take too long.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:44.880
So he's really emphasizes the, the, the fun of it and the clear

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.240
demonstration of who's the best.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.800
Now chess is an interesting game.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:53.640
It's probably different than grappling because it's been played for centuries.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.880
So there's this giant body of people that are playing it.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.120
Like there's other Gordon Rions out there.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.680
Imagine a world where there's multiple Gordon Rions or something like that.

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:09.400
It's a different dimensions, but, uh, you have like sharks everywhere.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:14.440
And so there, there is fun to be had even at the very, very, very, very top.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.960
But the, the memory recall is the thing that stands out and the hate of

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:23.280
imperfection, uh, more intense than anybody else in the game.

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.520
Fascinating.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.680
That takes us back to the final.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:28.600
Uh, yes.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:35.120
So, uh, here Gordon is facing, uh, Nicky Rod, former training partner.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.320
And, um, again, the intention here is this has to be put in the context that

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:45.400
Gordon will be fighting the greatest ADCC grappler of all time in a few hours after

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:53.080
this, so what we're looking for is a, uh, a quick resolution, um, still the

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:54.400
shortest possible match.

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.200
Now there's a complicating factor here.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.920
Nicky Rod was a wrestler before he was a Jiu-Jitsu player.

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:09.000
On paper, the way his route to win is via wrestling.

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:15.200
He's not going to be able to, um, submit Gordon Ryan and he's not going

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.640
to be able to pass his guard, so he has to win by wrestling.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:23.440
In the ADCC finals, you cannot sit to guard.

01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.160
So the, the approach that Gordon used earlier that we saw on video

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.760
cannot be used in the finals.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:30.520
Gordon must wrestle his opponent.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:41.040
So on the way out, uh, Gordon and I were talking and we'd had discussions

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.680
obviously during the cam, what's the appropriate thing to do here.

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:52.880
And there had been some matches earlier in the event where it was becoming

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:57.640
obvious that stalling was being heavily punished by referees.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:07.760
So I said to Gordon on the way out, just give him your leg, let him take you down

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:11.760
because in the first 10 minutes of the finals, takedowns don't score anything.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.560
There are no, there are no means of scoring the first 10 minutes, but you

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:18.800
can't sit to guard that will be, that will award you a negative point.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.680
So I said, just let Nicky Rod take you down.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.960
And he's like, Nicky Rod's not going to take the bait.

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.600
And I said, if he doesn't, I'll call him for stalling.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:32.200
And so, and then Craig Jones also commented after the fact is, I don't

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.640
know why Nicky Rod took the bait.

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:39.880
So if we see the start of the match, you see Gordon comes out and offers a leg.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:43.120
Now it's not that, you know, Nicky Rod is smart.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.360
He knows what's happening here.

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.360
And, uh, what's he going to do?

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.440
Stalled for 10 minutes and get like five stalling calls put against them.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.640
So Gordon gives them the take down that way.

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:55.200
They go to the ground immediately with no effort.

01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:02.040
And the match now favors Gordon because Gordon is, uh, significantly

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.280
more skilled on the ground.

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.360
Um, the question is, how can we make this match as short as possible?

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.920
And as is so often the case, the answer comes back to legs.

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:18.560
So, uh, for people just listening to this, Gordon is in an open guard and Nicky

01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:21.720
Rod appears to be trying to keep his hips away from Gordon's legs.

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:22.080
Yes.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.840
The big Nicky Rod knows there's a danger here.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:29.920
So he's elected to go to his knees that will set up his favorite body lock

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:35.360
passes and it will in some ways mitigate some of the dangers associated with leg

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:35.720
locks.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.600
So Gordon's whole thing is how am I going to get my body weight underneath them?

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.080
He has a choice between linear entries, where he enters between his opponent's

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.120
knees and circular entries, where he inverts and spins underneath his opponent

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:48.400
to get under a center of gravity.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.880
Is there a way for somebody to try to get a body lock without giving Gordon an

01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:55.640
opportunity to get under them?

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.280
Uh, well, the body lock is an excellent way to shut down leg lock entries.

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:03.280
If you can get to the body lock, but you can see Gordon's very, very disciplined

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.600
with his elbow and knee position.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:08.600
Elbows and knees, uh, work in a position where it's very, very hard for his

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.040
opponent to access his waist.

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.040
That shoulder is always either across the hip or in front of the shoulder.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:16.720
Sorry.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.080
His knee is either in front of the shoulder or in front of the hip.

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.200
And we're one minute into the match.

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:25.960
And just, if I were to look at the video player here, it appears that

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.200
the match is over soon.

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.320
So, uh, so I guess Nicky Rod is facing this.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:36.520
I need to get close in order to do the, uh, the body lock and the closer you

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:43.760
get, the more danger there is, uh, to let Gordon get, um, under you

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.240
and get the leg control.

01:32:46.240 --> 01:33:02.320
Now they're starting to get close here.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:04.680
Gordon's going to try and get his head underneath his opponent and make

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:06.040
a circular entry into the legs.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:11.040
He's clearing his opponent's head out of the way by faking the arm drag on the

01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.880
far side first move that he used against his first move the leg, the

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.920
against his first opponent earlier in the tournament.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:23.800
And there's the leg spins underneath it goes circular, rotates through, gets

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.360
his body weight underneath his opponent.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.400
And now he's going to trip him down to the mat.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.960
Now, uh, I believe Nicky Ratt tries to pull out his foot here.

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:38.560
And Craig also said that Nicky Ratt has gotten used to be able to

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.160
pull that foot out from anybody.

01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:45.920
And then he was very surprised at the grip that, that Gordon was

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.320
able to actually hold on.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.280
So I just want to comment.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.440
I'm, I'm just, I'm just parroting commentary.

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:55.440
Um, if you, if you, if you look at what's happening here from the internet,

01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:01.400
uh, this, if you just freeze it, you'll see that Gordon, like any good leg

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.880
locker will always treat his opponent's foot like a knot at the end of the rope.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:10.000
Just as you slide down a rope, if there's a knot at the end, your hand

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.720
will catch so too with the human leg.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:18.120
When they go to extract by pulling, you just keep your fist as close to your

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:21.840
shoulder, shoulder as possible and narrow the gap, the foot will always catch.

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.040
The failure that many people have is they let their hand drift away from their own

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.360
shoulder and so there's room for the foot to extract, but you'll see Gordon's

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.560
extremely disciplined with thumb close to his own shoulder, which creates a

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.440
situation that's very, very hard just to simply pull your foot out.

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.760
You're focusing on the knot of the foot.

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:38.600
Yeah.

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.200
Also, it's very early in the match.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:41.240
There's very little sweat.

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.240
Both athletes are still pretty dry.

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.640
Now Gordon has to climb the leg and now he's already captured his opponent's

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:53.640
shoelace, there's the heel exposure coming up, Nicky Rod already knows

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.880
things are getting bad and there's the win.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:59.640
Actually, the comment I made, I guess was from a little bit earlier.

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:04.560
There's an earlier time where Nicky Rod was trying to pull out the foot and the

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.680
Gordon is able to hold on to the knot, which is interesting.

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:14.560
Now that was a brilliant day's work by Gordon Ryan.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:18.640
He's had two matches against opponents considerably bigger and stronger than

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:25.560
himself and the time of the two matches can be measured in I think less than two

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:28.920
minutes, so he's done what he set out to do.

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.920
No injuries, no exhaustion.

01:35:31.280 --> 01:35:33.400
He's beaten four guys back to back.

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:38.080
All of them are excellent athletes with minimal energy expenditure and he's

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:39.680
ready to go on to his super fight.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:48.520
And that's against one of the greatest, arguably for a long time, really, really

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:53.440
up there, Jiu-Jitsu practitioners, competitors, grappling no-geek competitors

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.000
of all time, which is Andre Gavau.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.760
Yes, Andre Gavau is almost certainly at this point, the greatest

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.400
ADCC competitor of all time.

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:04.160
One more super fight than anyone else by a landslide.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:10.160
So if I may just read a few words you've written on Instagram about this match

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.680
about Andre Gavau on greatness.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:17.520
How great you become in any given endeavor will always be assessed by the degree of

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:21.960
difficulty of the barriers you had to overcome to get to the top, just as the

01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:27.080
lion became king of the jungle, not by living among sheep, but by dominating a

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:31.600
world of elephants, hyenas, buffalo, leopards, crocodiles.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.440
So too, the greatness of an athlete will be determined not just by his own ability,

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:39.000
but by the greatness of the athletes he faces.

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:44.680
Thus in his quest for greatness, Gordon Ryan owes a debt to the greatness of his

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:47.160
toughest opponent, Andre Gavau.

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.120
And you go on to sing him praises.

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.680
So, and that introduces this match.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.280
You know, there was an interesting moment.

01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:01.800
I didn't even, uh, listen to the words exchanged, but because I had the great

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:07.600
fortune of sitting next to hydro crazy, there was this, uh, fascinating moment

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.480
before the match and I can't believe Gordon is sufficiently relaxed to do this,

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:17.680
but he walked up to, uh, hydro Gracie and had a discussion.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.600
What do you think you face Hunter Gavau before?

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.760
What are your suggestions?

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.480
And they've talked to back and forth.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.840
They brainstormed ideas like minutes before the match.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:31.520
And it was just a beautiful moment of like, I don't know, like the, like

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.640
Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan talking to each other, something like that.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.480
I mean, I wonder how much brainstorming there really was or, and how much was it

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:46.600
just kind of, um, like spiritual inspiration or something like that.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:46.960
Yeah.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:49.400
The, I think it's more spiritual inspiration.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:55.080
He looks up to hydro as a, uh, uh, hydro is a very close friend and mentor of mine.

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:58.600
So I always tell my athletes, look to hydro as your example.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.240
This is a guy who always fought for the finish.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.920
She tried to express the, the highest ideal of jujitsu, which is control

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:10.280
leading to submission and every match he was ever in, he even lost matches on

01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:14.760
tactics against people that he could easily have defeated if he adopted a

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.240
different tactic, but he always insisted on victory by submission at

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:21.600
to find his career and made him who he was.

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:24.000
And I always try to have my athletes emulate him.

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.360
So what was the strategy going into this match?

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.120
What were you thinking?

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:28.960
What were you thinking?

01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:35.360
Uh, for Andre Galvant, he had, there's a sense in which Andre Galvant had to

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.880
fight literally the perfect match to win this.

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:39.400
Okay.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.720
This, this is a match that's going to be 20 minutes long, um, and

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:45.400
potentially 40 minutes long.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.600
Um, Andre Galvant cannot win by submission.

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.880
Gordon's submission dominance here is just too great.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:00.160
Uh, it would be exceedingly difficult for him to win on the ground.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:05.120
Uh, Gordon's ground positional game is just too advanced.

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:08.720
And so for Andre Galvant, he had to win.

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:12.560
If he was going to win, it was going to be in a standing wrestling

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:17.240
exchange where most people assessed him as having a measure of

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.080
superiority over Gordon Ryan.

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:29.840
The problem is that it's hard to just keep a potentially 40 minute match on

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:34.320
the ground, sorry, off the ground that whole time, it's very, very difficult

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:34.720
indeed.

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:38.360
So he would have had to fight literally the perfect tactical match to make it

01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:41.840
happen and he would have to do it without getting called for stalling points.

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:47.720
Um, Gordon has the luxury that if at any point they go to the ground, he has

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:52.120
complete dominance, but Gordon too has a problem that he can't pull

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:53.840
guard without being penalized.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.200
And, uh, if Andre Galvant can play this tactical game of forcing Gordon to pull

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:05.520
guard and then staying at a distance where he doesn't, he's doing enough

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.040
action not to get called for stalling, but not so much to engage with the

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:11.480
dangerous Gordon Ryan on the ground.

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.480
Then it's feasible.

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:18.520
He could have won, but it would have been, as I said, it would have required

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:23.000
the most perfect application and integration of technique and tactics

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.280
that, that he's capable of.

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.360
How much intimidation was here?

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.360
Was there, uh, or are these assets already beyond that?

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.520
Uh, when you say intimidation, be more precise.

01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.000
Do you think there was some degree, if you're just to empathize with Andre

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.680
Galvão, do you think there's some degree in which Gordon was in his head?

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:48.200
Um, because of the trash talk leading up to a certain events, because of the

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:54.280
level of dominance that Gordon has shown in this competition and in, uh, uh,

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.040
months and years leading up to it.

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:01.160
Also the fact that Andre Galvão is also a coach of a large team.

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:08.040
So there's some pressure to demonstrate to the team that the old line still got it.

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:08.760
Yeah.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.280
Um, I can't speak for Andre, but, uh, I know for Gordon, it's hard to be

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:19.560
intimidated when you know the other guy has no method of finishing you.

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:24.200
It's, it just takes so much pressure off.

01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:27.360
When you just go in there saying there's literally no way this guy can finish me.

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.880
Um, and there's no way this guy can pin and control me.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:33.920
I can't be finished.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:35.600
I can't be pinned and controlled.

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.080
The only way I can lose this is if this guy plays a tactical game.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:48.200
So in his best case scenario, I lose by tactical, by a tactical game.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:51.640
But from Andre's perspective, it's like, if I make one screw up,

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.800
this kid could finish me.

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.600
Like it's, you can see which way the intimidation game goes.

01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:00.440
Now for the start, things get interesting here.

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:04.440
We've already said, if you could just freeze it right there, Andre's

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.840
only real, realistic path to victory is standing grappling.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:08.640
Okay.

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:14.400
That would require him to take Gordon down, presumably multiple times after

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.760
the first 10 minutes and not be taken down at all by Gordon.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:19.560
So it's a tall order.

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:21.560
It's possible, but difficult.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:24.280
And here's where things get interesting.

01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:28.040
I told Gordon before the match, just go out and offer him the leg.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:29.680
Same way you do with Nicky Rod.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.160
And that's where things get interesting.

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:37.360
I must say that I'd loved what Andre Galván did at the start of this match.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.360
He's a little crazy here.

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:42.320
This is, there was just so much energy in the room at this point that his hand

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.000
fighting got a little-

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.160
Oh, for people just listening, there's a bit of hard slapping.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:46.760
Yeah, that's fine.

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.240
That could be considered a strike.

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:49.080
It's fine.

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.800
It's, there was just a lot of electric atmosphere in the room.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.480
So now things settle down a little bit.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.440
But here's where things get interesting.

01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.680
Here's where things get interesting.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:04.360
Andre throws the whole tactical game out the window right from the start.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.400
He goes for the takedown.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.640
Gordon doesn't try to fight the takedown because it's in his

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:10.400
interests to go to the ground.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.360
But this, I love this about Andre.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.320
He's literally like, fuck you, kid.

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.680
Let's see how good your ground game is.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.240
So he shoots the takedown and Gordon accepts it obviously, because it's to

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:27.080
his advantage to accept it, but I love the fact that Andre was like, I'm not

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:30.120
even going to try and stall this out.

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.520
I'm just going to bang.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.080
There it is.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.800
So he's like, okay, let's see what you got, kid.

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:35.760
They say you're good on the ground.

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.880
Let's see what you fucking got.

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:39.440
And I love that about Andre.

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.520
Unfortunately, he's entered the, the Hornet's Nest now.

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.120
What happened there real quick?

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.080
Cause that was very-

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.480
Gordon immediately went into Ashigarami.

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.800
Not just any Ashigarami, but Ashigarami was holding both legs.

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:54.240
So there's an open guard and he scooted forward.

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:55.800
Oh, wow.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.040
That's really nice.

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.920
So he splits the legs, now he dominates the space between the knees.

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:02.160
So there's a guaranteed straight Ashigarami here.

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:07.880
He split the knees against Andre Gauvold, like effortlessly right there.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:09.240
Wow.

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:13.360
So already Gordon's in his preferred domain now.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:15.080
So he's starting to off balance his opponent.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.120
He's looking for a reaction to get heel exposure.

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:19.040
He does get heel exposure.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.560
Andre's does a good job of monitoring the feet to try and reduce the breaking

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:28.680
pressure, but the, the brute fact is it's in Gordon's realm now.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.240
This is, this is where he has all the advantage.

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:37.320
So, um, and the match is going to be 20 minutes of in Gordon's realm.

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:39.520
That's going to be a very, very tall order.

01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:45.040
Was there a moment here?

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.440
Again, Gordon's on the legs.

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:52.240
Are you impressed that Andre was able to get out from this?

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:56.200
I would expect this Andre's been preparing for this for two years.

01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.680
And, um, uh, Andre has gone against some of the greatest, uh, leg lockers

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.400
in grappling before and prevailed.

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:05.680
So he's, he's not naive, you know, he knows how to defend himself.

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:10.760
Um, the big problem is that he's going to create defensive reactions, which

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.440
lead into other aspects of Gordon's game in particular back exposure.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:19.920
So here, uh, Ashigarami goes to like a single leg type of position where

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.560
Gordon runs to Andre's back.

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:29.000
Now he has to return him to the mat.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.840
The most efficient way to do so is always courtesy of foot sweeping.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:35.360
So he pulls out a Diashe Harae from the back to sweep him down to the mat.

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:41.120
And now Gordon's on top and this is a serious problem for any

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:41.960
grappler in the world.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:44.920
Once Gordon gets top position, he's just relentless.

01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:47.960
But just getting Andre Gavars good, just getting the guard

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.840
back, all of that is great.

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.840
There's also a sense here in which Gordon is pacing it too, just

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:54.880
to physically fatigue an opponent.

01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:00.080
So it was passing the guard, but not rushing it.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:07.120
Now what Gordon's looking for here is complete chest to chest contact.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.120
He's getting very close to it now.

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:13.360
And once he gets chest to chest on an opponent in top position, past

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:16.520
one of his opponent's knees, it's going to be awfully, awfully

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.040
difficult for an opponent to recover.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.720
What is he waiting for here?

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:27.640
Is there, there's pressure here over time?

01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.520
He just wears you out.

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:32.240
Yeah, it's part of a campaign of attrition, of pressure over time.

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:34.920
Now he's creating a situation where he's, he's either going to get

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:38.680
a little bit of pressure here, or he's going to get a little bit of pressure

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:43.320
where he's, he's either going to get back exposure or mount exposure.

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.280
And either way is pretty much fatal when you're dealing with Gordon.

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:50.120
Um, Andre elected to, to go the route of back exposure.

01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:03.080
Now Gordon got the body triangle is on his back and now it's, uh, now

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:04.680
there's one physical problem here.

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.800
That's, uh, that Andre Galvin has a neck like a ball and, um, he's a

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:11.600
very short and very thick neck.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:15.520
So penetrating under the chin for a strangle can be a real problem.

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.000
He also has extremely well-developed shoulders and upper arms.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.960
So when the head comes down and the shoulders go up, there's very

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.120
little real estate to work with, with regards to your strangle holds.

01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:30.360
So Gordon in time will trap one of his opponent's arms with his legs in

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:33.040
order to take away one of those strong defensive arms there, you can see

01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:36.680
the arm has been trapped and now he can start walking towards the strangle.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.560
And now here is still difficult.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.640
It's still difficult, but, um, things are looking good.

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:45.200
There's still considerable amount of time left on the clock.

01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.640
Gordon is well ahead on points.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:49.640
So all the pressure, all the tactical pressure now is on Andre.

01:47:49.640 --> 01:48:06.400
You'll see the critical penetration of the jaw with, uh, right now, yeah.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.400
Now Gordon, the legs for a one-handed strangle.

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:15.280
Wow.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:21.520
Andre fought very bravely, but the strangle, it doesn't

01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:22.480
matter how brave you are.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:29.480
And where, where does the strangle actually happen in terms of, um, it

01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:34.720
felt like the strangles at the blade of the, it wasn't even fully sunk in.

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:35.040
Yeah.

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:39.240
Where, so where does, is that like a full comers, like a one-handed

01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.520
there's a sense in which once you get underneath, you know, the inevitable

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:45.800
follow-up is again, the inevitable.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:47.000
You're feeling the inevitable.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.040
It's like a, um, to go back to your chess analogy, it's like resigning in chess.

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:51.400
Yeah.

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:56.320
And chess is considered almost like impolite to let, let it run out when you

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:03.920
understand, when you understand that death is on the horizon and there's a

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:06.800
lot of, uh, there's a lot of respect.

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.160
That was the beautiful thing with all the trash talk and everything like that.

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.480
Gordon always shows respect.

01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:16.800
I love that, um, about the drama of combat is trash talk in the

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.400
beginning and respect at the end.

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:23.080
I think it's, you know, when you, when you feel someone, uh, Andre has great

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:26.640
skills and, uh, when you, when you grapple someone, you feel just how skilled they

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:34.040
are and, um, uh, it, whatever issues you had prior to the match evaporate when

01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.640
you, when you feel that, okay, they're just like you, they do the same moves

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:39.520
and same kind of concepts.

01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:44.000
And, and you see that there's more that bonds you together than separates you.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.120
And, uh, that's the feeling that the end of most grappling matches.

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:54.120
So if we could talk about John Carlo, who had an incredible performance, and I

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:56.840
mean, there's a lot of things we can say, we can probably go through his matches,

01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.560
but if we could just talk without that, about some of the most impressive

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:01.800
things that you saw about him.

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.800
One of the things I think you mentioned, uh, elsewhere in here is about confidence.

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:10.760
So one of the things you saw that could really benefit him as an athlete and

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:12.960
competitor is to build up his confidence.

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.880
Is there, uh, can you speak to that?

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.120
First of all, I should give you some background.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:25.200
John Carlo Badoni was a, um, uh, a strong, uh, local black belt in Boston, um,

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.520
teaching at Bonata Faria school.

01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.840
When I would film instructional videos, I would often talk to him and talk to him

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.240
about his competitions in training and, um, he would do local competitions.

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:40.960
He was trying to go from gi training, which was the majority of his competitive

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.880
background into no gi, and he was struggling, uh, in local competitions,

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.680
especially with things like leg locking where he had no background in leg

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:52.200
locking and, um, would often get submitted.

01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:56.400
So as we worked together in instructional videos, we, uh, we would

01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:59.840
talk and discuss how it would periodically come to the gym in New York

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:01.760
city and come in to work out with the guys.

01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:04.480
And, um, he often struggled in the training room.

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:07.160
He had no experience with things like body lock guard passing.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:11.800
And this used to mean that he was, uh, many of the training

01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:13.160
sessions didn't go well for him.

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:21.360
Um, so he was always like a very polite, well-spoken young man and, uh, worked hard.

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:30.840
Um, when we went to Puerto Rico and the team ended up drifting apart, um, when we

01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:37.960
moved into Austin, uh, he, he said, you know, now that many of your athletes have

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:40.440
left, could it, could I come down and train with you guys full time?

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:41.880
And I was like, yeah, I'd love to.

01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:45.040
I thought it'd be a great training partner for Gordon and Gary.

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:47.520
We didn't really have any training partners at that point.

01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:52.440
And, um, uh, sure enough, he literally just picked up everything he

01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:54.040
had and moved down to Austin.

01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:58.760
Um, now anyone who just moves halfway across the country to begin training,

01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:00.400
that already gets my respect right there.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.400
That's a big commitment.

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:04.600
And, um, uh, he began training.

01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:09.680
We put him on a, uh, uh, a training schedule where first he had to

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:11.120
cover up his big weaknesses.

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:15.520
He had limited attacks from, uh, bottom position.

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:22.040
He had poor leg lock defense and he was very, very vulnerable to, um, uh, certain

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:25.640
kinds of guard passing, which weren't part of his experience.

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.720
This is all a year out from ADCC.

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.120
Yes.

01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:34.040
And we should also maybe, uh, give the, the spoiler, which is he wins his

01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.480
division in a dominant fashion.

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.160
Uh, he also does incredibly well at the absolute.

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:42.520
Yeah, it was an amazing thing.

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:45.080
Um, to give you an idea, when he first moved to Austin, he

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:48.400
competed in, um, a WNL event.

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:54.080
And I don't think he scored a single point, lost a couple of matches and, um,

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.400
uh, and including matches to people who were in this ADCC.

01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:04.280
So, um, uh, he came out of that looking very depressed and, uh, he lost to

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:07.960
Ken and Duarte, he lost to, um, uh, Mason Fowler.

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:12.440
So John Carlo always struck me as someone who was positionally sound.

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:16.960
He had like good guard retention, things like this, but he, he had no offense.

01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:21.560
He had no leg lock defense and he just wasn't able to assert authority on matches.

01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:23.760
He was, he was, he was a guy who was always going to be tough to be, cause

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.280
it was hard to pass his guard, that kind of thing, but he wasn't dangerous.

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:28.440
Can I ask you a question on that?

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:28.760
Yeah.

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.880
Cause my interaction with him, uh, early on when you came to Austin, I remember

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.920
he interacted with me a bunch on the mat showing me stuff, but I wonder if that

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:40.960
kindness is a detriment to the confidence.

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.840
Is there some connection?

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:43.960
Again,

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:45.880
killers can be nice to

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:50.800
absolutely confidence comes from skill level and, um, uh, confidence

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:56.040
is a much more rational thing than most people ascribe it.

01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:00.440
People who think of confidence is like this esoteric, ethereal element

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:01.720
that you either have or you don't.

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:05.760
When in fact, confidence is much more a reflection, a rational

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.760
reflection on your past experience.

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:11.320
And if you're successful with your past experience and you're expecting

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:18.400
to, uh, uh, compete in a situation, which is similar to your past experience

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.720
and that past experience has mostly been successful, you'll be confident.

01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:24.640
Are you pretty confident that the sun will rise tomorrow?

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.760
Of course you are because it's done.

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:31.080
So every time in the past, now there's no, uh, as people like Hume pointed out,

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:35.600
there's no supreme rational reason for believing this, but nonetheless,

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:36.640
your confidence is high.

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:37.920
And it's the same thing in jujitsu.

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:44.720
Um, if, if you're performing well and skills, uh, the reason for that, your

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:47.520
confidence will be high in the future, regardless of what your mindset is.

01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.960
So it's not a question of, you know, this personality does better in competition

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:56.840
or that personality ultimately is going to come down to your skills and, um, and

01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.040
your confidence will be a reflection of your accumulation of skills.

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:07.720
So what was his journey like to a person who lost to a person who dominated the

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:08.360
competition?

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:08.720
Yeah.

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:12.440
First things first, we had to say, okay, you've got an obvious weakness, leg lock

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:13.080
defense.

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:18.880
So, um, every day in the gym, he would be taught, okay, this is where you put your

01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:22.480
feet, this is where you position your knees, your point, you need this way, not

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:22.960
this way.

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:29.440
Um, uh, then he would have to start sparring situations in leg locks and have

01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.680
to work his way out.

01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:37.480
Um, initially these were like heartbreaking sessions for him where, I

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.320
mean, I've got to give that kid full credit.

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.440
Like he just worked his way through it patiently dealt with frustration,

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:47.640
initial failures, and just said, I'm going to get better.

01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:48.920
Can we just look at on that?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.600
So what's the experience of those early training sessions?

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:57.440
Like from an athlete perspective, are you basically dealing with the rational

01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.520
thought that you're not going to ever be good?

01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:01.680
Yeah.

01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:04.360
You, you're wondering, have I even got what it takes?

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:06.320
Like, you know, think about it.

01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:09.920
He's, he's an established player who's been in IBGF competition, I believe

01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.160
he's a brown belt world champion in the GEE.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:18.080
Um, and suddenly a group of kids that he's never even seen before repeatedly

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:20.440
submitting them with leg logs and the gym.

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.520
And he's like, man, this, this is terrible.

01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:28.280
Like a year from now, I'm supposed to fight ADCC against people like Craig

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:32.720
Jones, like some of the best leg lockers in the world, like it must have been

01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:39.840
hard, you know, um, but he just stayed in there and no one worked harder than him.

01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:43.720
He just was in the gym three times a day studying every day.

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:47.400
And unlike so many other people, every time he was showing something, he

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:52.920
consciously and deliberately tried to enact it, even at the price of initial failure.

01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:56.000
Do you advise that that's a good way to go?

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:57.240
It's the only way to go.

01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:03.880
Like if you, if you can't wrap your head around the idea that trying to acquire

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:11.240
new skills will create a temporary time where your effectiveness diminishes as

01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:14.320
you're trying to bring on new skills, you're never going to make it because

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:16.440
you'll always stay at whatever skillset you are.

01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:25.320
The whole mental trick is to, is to imbue this idea of delayed gratification

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:32.120
that you have to accept that when I bring on new moves, my overall effectiveness

01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:38.680
will diminish, but there's the belief that in time, as my skill performance

01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:43.280
increases, it will increase over time, but it will come at the price of

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.160
initial frustration and failure.

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:51.960
And John Carlo made that mental, uh, switch early on in his time in Austin.

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:56.600
And to his credit, just stuck through within a very short period of time,

01:57:56.600 --> 01:57:57.880
he came very hard to leg lock.

01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:02.360
And, um, uh, even the best leg lockers in the room had a hard time with them.

01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.520
And that's the, that was the first step in confidence is that, okay, I'm not

01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.080
getting finished quickly anymore.

01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.920
Then he had to bring in a whole new set of, uh, upper body submissions.

01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:14.920
He neglected upper body submissions.

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:19.360
When you say upper body submissions, do you mean not the arm locks, things like

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:24.200
this, and, um, uh, in particularly put very, very hard work on his strangleholds.

01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:27.000
Um, he had always been someone who was positionally strong.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.480
He could get to the back, but he could never finish from the back.

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:33.320
And then suddenly in the gym, he started finishing from the back.

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:38.400
And then as gym performance against the lesser students increased, then you bump

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:39.680
them up against better students.

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:43.320
And then this goes on all the way up to the best guys in the room.

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:49.720
And, uh, in time, in a relatively short period of time, there were significant

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:56.520
increases in performance and, uh, success begets success and this get going.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.760
We started to get a hint of his developing confidence in local competitions.

01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:08.080
I remember putting, uh, seeing John Carlo compete in a local fight to win

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.480
competition against the tough Brazilian kid.

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.880
John Carlo just came out, dominated and finished with a leg lock.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Now that was, that was interesting.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:20.560
It's like, okay, you're the guy that used to get finished by leg locks and now

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.480
you're beating tough opponents with leg locks.

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:26.400
And that was an important psychological step for John Carlo Badoni.

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:32.640
And, um, uh, with each little step as we went further and further, uh, then

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:35.640
he got to ADCC trials and had one of the great performances.

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:42.280
Um, I believe he submitted all of his opponents in ADCC trials and, uh, put

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.680
on a fantastic display of, of grappling.

01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:48.000
Shockingly, no one paid attention to it.

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.120
They were just like, oh yeah, he won.

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:54.720
And the John Carlo flew into ADCC completely under the radar.

01:59:54.720 --> 02:00:00.240
They just saw him as, oh, he's the guy that won American trials and, uh, no

02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:01.720
one really paid much attention.

02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:08.000
Um, in his first match, he took on a great, um, uh, Brazilian champion, uh,

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:11.640
Izaque and, um, uh, won in dominant fashion.

02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:14.440
He was about to strangle him with just a few seconds left on the clock.

02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:17.560
And I remember John Carlo being furious at the end of the match.

02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:21.240
Um, thinking like I was so close to finishing.

02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:22.680
He wanted a perfect finish.

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:27.960
And, uh, up on points, six to nothing, and, uh, still chasing, still chasing.

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:30.640
I mean, he could have just coasted at this point, but he wanted to finish

02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:34.880
every one of his opponents and, uh, he got very, very close, but not quite there.

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:40.880
And, um, then in his next match, he had to take on the defending gold medalist

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:44.440
from the previous, uh, uh, uh, ADCC.

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:45.360
Yeah, Mateo Diniz.

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:47.280
This was the guy who was the favorite to win.

02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:51.760
So you have a relatively unknown John Carlo fighting the man who took on

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:55.960
fighting the man who defeated Craig Jones in the previous ADCC.

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:01.400
What, uh, do you remember what stood out to you about this match?

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.560
So, um, Diniz is good wrestling is good.

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:05.360
Everything is all around grabber.

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.920
Uh, he's got, uh, by juditsu standards, he's a very strong wrestler.

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:11.640
So our intention was to match his wrestling with John

02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:14.320
Carlo's, uh, uh, judo skills.

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:19.960
So, um, you will see if we could, um, perhaps go back.

02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:24.240
You'll see the first, uh, take down

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:33.560
arm drag and took him down with a simple dragon pick.

02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:36.360
So that was John Carlos, uh, first take down.

02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:39.400
That was more wrestling oriented and good for his confidence to see that

02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.320
he could, uh, score a nice take down.

02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:47.120
But, um, uh, Mateus Diniz is very, very good at standing up from bottom position.

02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:48.360
If we just go back to the stamp.

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:49.240
Okay.

02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:50.600
Now here we have something interesting.

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:54.680
Mateus comes up from bottom, seizes a leg and John Carlo defends the

02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:59.840
wrestling move and then goes immediately into it's kind of a mix of society.

02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.280
And, uh, and the, I was beautiful.

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:03.320
I didn't even notice that.

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:04.520
That's really nice.

02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:13.440
Look at that from, from, uh, defending a single threatening, uh, Gatine.

02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.840
One of the big themes of our ADCC camp was that most of our opponents now

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:20.480
are getting very strong and hand fighting.

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.040
But they are not strong in foot fighting.

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:28.120
And so we put a very heavy emphasis on, on, uh, foot sweeping attacks.

02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:31.440
You remember Gordon Ryan took down Andre Galvin with a foot sweep.

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:35.520
And here you have John Carlo using the same, uh, technique, not from the

02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:43.520
back, but from the front and an overhook, uh, probably in post catches the foot

02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.640
mid-air and that's just a beautiful, beautiful take down.

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:49.320
That's beautiful judo.

02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:55.960
And then, uh, and then later in the match, you'll use a Kusaragake, another

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.560
classical judo take down, uh, to get top position.

02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.160
Now at one point, John Carlo was in trouble.

02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:08.840
He got his back exposed with this situation.

02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:09.720
Good.

02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:15.400
Double leg to, uh, to a knee pick.

02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:16.080
Knee pick.

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:21.200
So he has to, uh, expose his back in order to avoid giving up take down points.

02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.400
But here's a defensive training that we work on is, is coming through.

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:29.720
He's defensively sound, shuts out the hook, prevents the score.

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:34.680
Keeps his body at the right angle to prevent a power half Nelson.

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:40.840
Staying calm.

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.640
Now he's got to turn this around.

02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.280
It's one of the hardest things to do in grappling.

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.240
How dangerous is it to put your, um, in this position, to put

02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:52.400
your hands on the ground?

02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:56.320
Um, it's ordinarily, it could be dangerous because your opponent

02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:57.960
could switch to an armbar, whoops.

02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:58.880
And there's the body lock.

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:03.040
Now there's some controversy here, but you can clearly see it.

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:06.480
Uh, uh, the hands were locked, so it shouldn't really be as

02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:07.680
controversial as people are saying.

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:11.760
Now watch for the right leg Kusaragake here, pulls in the hips, exposes

02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:15.600
the leg, boom and down beautiful Kusaragake.

02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:27.440
Also probably a lesson that, uh, complaining to a ref does not

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:29.600
protect you from a good take down.

02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.040
Yeah.

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.280
That's why they say in combat sports, defend yourself at all times.

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:39.120
Um, but now the great advantage of, of judo take downs over wrestling

02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:42.960
leg tackles is they confer upper body connection after the take down,

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:44.880
which is very, very important for ADCC.

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:47.440
That's why we put such a heavy emphasis on them.

02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:52.040
And, um, now John Carlos is absolutely in the driver's seat.

02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:54.240
He just scored four points for that take down.

02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:58.000
So he's well ahead at this point against the established favorite

02:04:58.040 --> 02:04:59.760
for the entire weight division.

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:03.200
So now Matthias Denise has to start taking some risks.

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:06.800
He's staring down the barrel of defeat and there's not that much time left.

02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:09.360
And that's what's going to set up the pressure.

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:10.600
Now it's tactical pressure.

02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:11.600
It's not physical pressure.

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.320
It's tactical.

02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:17.360
Matthias has to turn away and that's going to create back exposure, the

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.520
most dangerous kind of exposure in ADCC.

02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:21.720
Oh, there it is.

02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:24.760
Mount to back.

02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:31.360
And, uh, Giancarlo capitalizes.

02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:32.280
Matthias is smart.

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:36.000
He's keeping on his side so that less than 75% of his back is on the

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.720
floor to deny the, uh, the mountain points, but that comes at a price.

02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.560
And that price is back exposure.

02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:48.080
So the thing we talked about with Gordon, the, the circumstance of fate,

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:53.160
which is he has a lot of grueling tough matches and still chooses to do absolute.

02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:56.400
So what's, and he seems to just power through all of it.

02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:01.240
What, how much of it, how much of it does he have to do to be

02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:04.920
how much of the calculation is how to survive the cardio, the grueling

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:06.280
cardio aspect of all of this?

02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.920
That's, uh, it's a great question.

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:13.440
And the truth of the matter is you can't afford to pace yourself.

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:19.000
Because if you say, I'm going to hold myself back for this match and

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.480
expectation of the others, you could end up losing your first match.

02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:24.000
So he didn't pace himself at all.

02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:27.480
Any of the matches you have to just be in good shape.

02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:29.000
And that's what the, some of the

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.400
campus, no, it's mostly physical.

02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:37.120
That's what the campus for, like he's felt more pressure in the training room

02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.760
that he felt in any of his matches.

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.000
But still sort of attacking.

02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:49.520
Look at this transition from back or from whatever the heck that position was.

02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:55.360
Uh, it right from, uh, from looking for the back transitioning here.

02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:57.080
What the heck is this transition?

02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:01.080
So Matthias is engaging in a very good tactic, which is to get most of his

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:03.360
back off the ground, to deny them the mount points.

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:08.840
So as back exposure starts to occur, he turns in, but you can see what's happening

02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:12.240
here as the left foot goes under, it's going to create a beautiful triangle entry.

02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:18.800
Right foot penetrates through underneath the neck and now he's locking a triangle

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:23.240
as Senkaku, but not just any triangle, a triangle with the, the figure four

02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:26.160
locked on the back of the opponent's head, which makes any kind of stacking

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:28.080
defense very, very difficult.

02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:31.240
It makes it very, very hard for an opponent to pull away and creates a

02:07:31.240 --> 02:07:32.880
much tighter strangle than average.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.600
And as a result, it's a quick submission.

02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:39.320
Beautifully done.

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:40.760
Still chasing the submission.

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:41.880
Yes.

02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.040
Uh, with a minute left up on points against the former champion, against

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:48.920
the former champion, that's match number two.

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:52.120
Now that's the first day that's Saturday.

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:56.560
So John Carlo goes to sleep that night thinking, okay, I just beat a world

02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:59.720
champion in my first match and almost submitted him and I just submitted

02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:00.760
the defending champion.

02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:04.080
So of course he wakes up on Sunday morning, feeling pretty damn good.

02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.080
Now there's an interesting twist here.

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:11.680
His opponent is a, uh, talented young Irishman who won European trials, I

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:15.960
believe almost entirely with leg locks and almost all of his major attacks in

02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:17.400
the tournament so far being leg locks.

02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:20.760
Now bear in mind that a year ago, John Carlo was losing to local

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:22.480
blue belt competitors via leg lock.

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:26.080
So in my mind, I'm thinking, okay, how's he going to handle this?

02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:29.880
Will the, with the leg lock training kick in and you'll see the result.

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:42.880
Uh, John Carlos is on top passing an open guard, keeping his legs away from any

02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:47.680
attacks, his opponent, Owen from Ireland is employing the same tactics that

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:52.000
we made famous years ago, the idea of sitting to butterfly garden,

02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:53.600
looking to entangle the legs.

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:55.200
He's kind of playing that game.

02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:59.200
So, um, so John Carlos obviously used to this from training in the gym.

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:03.040
So he's doing a good job of preventing entanglement, controlling his opponent's

02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:07.040
shoelaces and moving out to an angle, which limits his opponent's entry options.

02:09:07.080 --> 02:09:11.720
So hands on the shoelaces and angles, uh, is a good defense here.

02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:13.880
It's an initial defense.

02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:16.760
Now his opponent wants to get underneath the center of gravity.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.520
So John Carlos wants to get outside the, uh, the line of his legs.

02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:23.400
At some point, your opponent is going to entangle.

02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.160
If he's determined to entangle at some point, it's going to happen.

02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:31.200
So John Carlos decides, okay, let's let it happen and let's see where his feet

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:38.320
go and let's see how disciplined he is with his feet and the opponent is inverted.

02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:42.760
Uh, here does a good job getting behind John Carlos knee.

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:44.880
So now they're fully locked in.

02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:50.040
So John Carlos moves away to protect the heel, rotates out, controls the shoelace.

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:55.160
Now at this point, the Irishman's starting to lose discipline with his own foot position.

02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:56.360
Okay.

02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:00.440
He's so focused on his own attack that he's starting to get a little

02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:01.920
sloppy with his own foot position.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:04.720
You see he's assuming, Oh, I'm the guy who's attacking.

02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:11.520
So my opponent will be afraid of my leg locks and is, uh, he's

02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.960
is starting to make some small tactical errors that John

02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.400
Carlos will be able to take advantage of.

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:20.880
So he's threatening the sort of the north south passer, like, uh,

02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:27.320
so he's not putting too much pressure on the past cause we're still pretty early

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:30.240
in the match and, um, he's not ready to score yet.

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:32.440
So here again, he turns away his heel.

02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:36.480
Now his opponent's starting to get more and more cavalier with his foot

02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:40.720
positioning to a point where now it's just downright sloppy.

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:46.520
So John Carlos sees it, identifies it, locks up a wrist to wrist toe

02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:48.800
hold and breaks his foot.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:56.760
How, how, where's the dumb question?

02:10:56.760 --> 02:10:57.920
Where's the control here?

02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:58.480
How is he?

02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:00.720
The control comes from his opponent.

02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:03.520
The entanglement is his, is his opponent.

02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:08.320
His opponent is holding his own body in place with his own legs.

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:12.160
So he's the root of his own problem here.

02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:14.560
So you got sloppy.

02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:15.480
Well done.

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:16.280
Well done.

02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:18.600
And a little smile from John.

02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:23.440
The reason for that smile, you can probably guess is because a year

02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:26.320
ago, this would have been a disaster.

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:30.880
And now instead it's a guaranteed ticket to the finals and either

02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:32.080
a gold or a silver medal.

02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.560
And so you can see in that compressed moment, that's the look of a man who's

02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:40.640
made was just recognized as how much progress he's made and what was once

02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:44.520
a weakness in roughly 10 months was the time it took.

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:50.960
And so, uh, he faces Lucas Hulk Barbosa in the, in the, in the final here.

02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.280
Now these two have a history.

02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:56.000
Um, Hulk has beaten, uh, John Carlo many times.

02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:02.240
And, um, so for John Carlo, it's a question of, okay, here I'm, I'm

02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:05.080
matched up against the guy who's repeatedly beaten me.

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:08.680
How am I, how am I going to turn this around now?

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.040
And in terms of, we talked earlier about confidence.

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:17.960
If confidence was just a mental thing, John Carlo never would have won this

02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:23.960
fight when you've lost all those times to an athlete, um, words aren't

02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:27.240
going to change anything, but you can see right from the start, when they

02:12:27.240 --> 02:12:31.720
get into the hand fight, John Carlo is much more technically adept with his

02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:34.520
hand fighting, he's doing a good job of controlling his opponent's hands,

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.920
preventing any kind of prolonged pressure on the head.

02:12:38.400 --> 02:12:42.320
And Hulk gets a sense here in which he's, he realized he's

02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:43.720
fighting a very different person.

02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:49.520
And this goes, this goes a long time.

02:12:51.960 --> 02:13:00.520
Again, another super grueling match, wrestling that eventually leads to

02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:04.240
a back take here, back triangle, body triangle.

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:13.760
Here, you can see the same tactics utilized by, um, Gordon Ryan, back

02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:17.640
control based around the body triangle, many attempts to try and trap his

02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:20.000
opponent's arm and take away those defensive arms.

02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:23.120
The main difference here is again, you have an athlete with a

02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:24.840
very powerful compact neck.

02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:26.560
So neck penetration is difficult.

02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:31.200
And so John Carlo will switch to a, uh, a palm to palm strangle instead

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:32.560
of the conventional figure four.

02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:39.440
And, uh, now there's eight minutes left.

02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:44.920
So all the time in the world, is it only just a matter of time at

02:13:44.920 --> 02:13:47.000
this point in situations like this?

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:47.200
Yeah.

02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:50.400
John Carlo has a massive tactical lead in points.

02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:53.040
There's literally no way he could lose this match at this point.

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:57.320
Um, even if his opponent did get out of here and take him down, John

02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:58.800
Carlo would still be a hit on points.

02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:05.760
So this question, the question now is not whether John Carlo will get the

02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:08.800
gold medal, but whether John Carlo will forget it by submission.

02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:09.680
And there it is.

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:13.360
There's the penetration of the neck and he can't get the figure four.

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:15.080
So he opts for palm to palm instead.

02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:16.120
And there's the submission.

02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:20.800
Now, what a journey, what is John Carlo's relatively unemotional man, but you can

02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:23.600
see there's, there's emotion that that's not fake.

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:24.360
That's genuine.

02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:29.200
And that's the emotions of a man who 10 months ago, couldn't have done that.

02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:35.560
And then 10 months later, by dint of his own hard work and dedication and, uh,

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:40.480
his ability to, to actively attack his weaknesses and turn them into strengths.

02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:45.800
And then develop an ability to, uh, to, to finish that, that was a truly,

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:47.320
truly remarkable achievement.

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:51.760
Let me ask you about, um, Gary Tonan.

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:59.600
So he is one of the, at least in my opinion, greatest submission

02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:00.840
grapplers of all time.

02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.920
There's a lot of components to that, but he lost a lot of his time.

02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.200
He lost a lot of his time.

02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:11.840
Not only did Gary lose, he lost to the bottom seed of his division and that in

02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:16.360
itself says something pretty remarkable about what's happening in ADCC, how

02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:24.840
there's a sense in which the days of the invited athletes being far superior

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:26.600
to the trials winners are over.

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:31.400
It was a clear signal that anyone who makes it to ADCC is going to lose.

02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:36.480
Um, Sam McNally is a very talented, uh, submission grappler from Ireland.

02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:40.840
He specializes mostly in armbars, um, but he has a good positional game as well.

02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:46.240
He has a very modern look to his, uh, to his jujitsu and, uh, he did a

02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:48.080
fantastic job against Gary Tonan.

02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:54.640
I think technically, uh, Gary perhaps got a little far away from, uh,

02:15:54.640 --> 02:16:01.160
his, uh, his, uh, his, uh, his, uh, his, uh, his, uh, his, uh, his, uh,

02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:07.400
from, uh, his true nature in grappling, which is relentless submission attack.

02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:13.480
And perhaps, uh, I should be given blame for this because I put such a heavy

02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:18.520
emphasis on the, in the training camp overall on positional pressure that I

02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:21.760
feel that worked very well for all of the athletes, except Gary Tonan.

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:23.320
And, um,

02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:23.880
Interesting.

02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:27.160
So his, his name, you have to acknowledge the nature of the athlete.

02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:31.800
And I think I was coaching so hard to the, to the new people in the room on

02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:37.000
positional pressure that I neglected Gary's, uh, uh, innate ability to, uh,

02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:41.560
the fact that he does best when he, um, attacks exclusively by submission.

02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:45.760
So I think if, if anyone should get blamed for the failure here, it should be me.

02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:55.800
Uh, there's another comment is, uh, maybe I'm over, um, overvaluing that sort of

02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:59.960
just the physical aspect of this, but it seemed like Gary was, looks skinny.

02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:01.320
Is the weight cut?

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:06.680
Yeah, he, um, this is the first time he ever went down to the, uh, 66 kilos.

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:10.160
So, um, you know, it wasn't critical.

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:12.880
There's other guys who were bigger than him who made the weight.

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:16.840
Um, but the way cut, if you can just comment on is that, does that ever

02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:22.320
play a part in the athletes, the, the physical and the mental aspect of the

02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:26.480
weight cut, it is, it is a thing in wrestling that could break even some

02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:27.440
of the toughest minds.

02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:31.560
Yeah, but no, it wasn't a weight cut that would break someone like Gary

02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:34.120
Turner and it was, it's more physical.

02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:36.560
You, you, you train lighter and weaker.

02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:38.680
You tend to get injured more in camp because you're lighter.

02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:43.960
Um, we have a team now after the breakout, that's mostly comprised

02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:46.600
of people over 215 pounds.

02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:50.480
So, um, uh, there's very few small people left in the gym.

02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:53.840
Most of the smaller athletes went, uh, to B team.

02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:58.080
So, um, uh, Gary's been struggling a little bit with, with training

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:04.520
partners and, um, uh, but here I think the chief problem was that, uh, Gary

02:18:04.520 --> 02:18:10.320
focused perhaps a little too much on the positional tactical game and got away

02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:15.480
from his, his true gift, which is, uh, uh, relentless hunting for submissions.

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.280
And as I said, I think the person to blame for that is me because I put, I

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:22.840
had to put so much emphasis on the positional game for the, for the

02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:26.560
developing athletes that, um, I didn't pay enough attention

02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:28.480
to Gary's unique attributes.

02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.720
So this, uh, I mentioned, I posted some stuff on Reddit.

02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:33.320
So there's a relevant question here.

02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:39.200
Uh, somebody on Reddit asked, uh, Gordon has said, and perhaps you have said as

02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:44.360
well, that there are two types of Jiu-Jitsu practitioners, ones who move

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:48.560
themselves around like Marcel Garcia and ones that control the motion of their

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:53.520
opponents, like Gordon, um, what are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach?

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:59.120
And how do those different approaches apply depending on which weight class you're in?

02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:01.280
That's a great set of questions.

02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:01.880
Yes.

02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:07.520
Um, uh, I'm the person who promulgates this idea that there's two broad ways

02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:14.040
you can go into Jiu-Jitsu, you can either focus on promoting your own movement to

02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:17.920
create opportunity or by restricting the other person's movement.

02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:24.720
Um, if you're a slower, less athletic opponent, then you should definitely

02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:27.960
focus on the idea of restricting the other fellow's movement.

02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:30.960
That's how slow unathletic people win in Jiu-Jitsu.

02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:37.040
If you're quick with the ability to change direction, stand up quickly, go

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:43.240
down quickly, um, and, uh, and move like a leopard, then you're almost always

02:19:43.240 --> 02:19:47.800
better off generating movement in order to create opportunity.

02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:52.120
So one is based more on movement as the, uh, the source of opportunity.

02:19:52.120 --> 02:19:56.000
One is based more upon pressure as the source of opportunity.

02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:59.840
So you'll get someone like Gary Tonan or the Rua Tolo brothers, their

02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:04.240
game is based around the idea of promoting their own movement to create

02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:07.600
opportunity, whereas someone like Gordon Ryan or Hodger Gracie is about

02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:12.840
restricting movement and using that pressure to create reactive opportunity.

02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:17.440
Those are the two paths you can take in Jiu-Jitsu because our team now has

02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:20.640
become mostly associated with people over 200 pounds and because most of them

02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:24.800
were beginners, I took the more high percentage approach of, okay, let's,

02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:29.120
uh, let's focus primarily on controlling the other fellow's movement.

02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:33.800
And, um, uh, but Gary's a unique individual and I feel like I let him

02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:40.480
down by not, uh, giving him special attention in regards to what he does.

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:43.920
The fact that you've mentioned this now, like four times in the, in the

02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:48.560
span of a few minutes, just, I love that, that, that all of this stuff weighs

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:53.920
so heavy on you, um, and he is a truly special person and it is truly interesting

02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:58.840
to see what is the nature of a particular athlete that, um, if you

02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:00.120
highlight makes them shine.

02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:02.880
Let's go to the part where Gary actually loses the match.

02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:03.800
Okay.

02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:06.120
So the match is pretty innocuous at this point.

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:12.360
The guy does a good job of turning into the arm and, um, Gary gets

02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:13.960
caught reaching from the knees.

02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:14.280
Okay.

02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:15.400
That's always a mistake.

02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:18.800
And, uh, the guy does it, I think there's a great job capitalizing on it.

02:21:19.440 --> 02:21:21.560
Now there's, there's limited time left on the clock.

02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:23.880
This guy realizes, oh, this is my opportunity.

02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:25.640
He's got good flexibility and he gets the hook.

02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:29.080
So if he just frees it right then, so there's a minute and a half left.

02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:33.920
And typically in ADCC, if you get the bag, you score three points.

02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:36.000
So, uh, this is a huge score.

02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:40.400
Um, for Gary to win here, it's got to be by submission.

02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:41.000
Okay.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.760
So Gary's made one mistake.

02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:48.280
Now, um, this talented young fellow from Ireland does a great job, not

02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:50.880
only of getting the bag, but he really attacks well from the back.

02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:55.000
And let's look at the depth of Gary Toner's defensive acumen here.

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:58.360
And we should say leading up to this, his defense is incredible.

02:21:58.400 --> 02:21:58.680
Yeah.

02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:00.520
He keeps escaping every position.

02:22:00.680 --> 02:22:03.720
A nickname for Gary is the slippery salmon because he's like trying to

02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:06.840
hold a goddamn salmon on the river bank, trying to hold onto this kid.

02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:09.920
So he gets into a position which looks absolutely hopeless here.

02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:10.560
It gets worse.

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:13.960
This is already bad, but, um, um,

02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:18.280
it's one of the most fun things about to watch while Gary's the skill in the escapes.

02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:19.400
It's, it's incredible.

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:21.040
It's, it's beautiful to watch.

02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:24.520
So the guy has an excellent opportunity to transition off here into a rare

02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:27.000
triangle, which is one of the hardest things in the world to get out of.

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:31.080
And from here, if this was anyone, but Gary Toner, and I think it would

02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:37.080
have been curtains, but you see Gary just extends, keeps his arm at just

02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:38.480
the right angle to pop out and gets out.

02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:41.840
So now Gary's like, Oh crap, I'm going to lose to this fucking guy.

02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:43.800
So he's got a minute left to do something.

02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:45.560
So he goes back into his submission mode.

02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:50.280
He goes back to who Gary Toner is and immediately goes into leg lock action.

02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:56.760
Now the, the, uh, the young man from Ireland realizes, Hey, I'm, I'm going

02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:58.920
to win this match against the number one seed.

02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:05.200
So Gary goes into the legs, gets to one of his favorite techniques, the heel hook.

02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:11.760
Now Gary has a brutal heel hook his heck and gets real pressure on the kid's leg.

02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:16.080
Yeah.

02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:17.840
But to his credit, the kid is smart.

02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:18.720
He's like, you know what?

02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:23.760
Let me, let me take some, let me take some weakness to that.

02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:26.320
Like, well, he turned his hips.

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:26.800
Yeah.

02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:31.600
It's unclear from the video where the Gary's, uh, um, slipped up.

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:33.240
There's considerable breaking pressure.

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:34.440
Oh, it slipped.

02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:34.720
Yeah.

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:35.240
Yeah.

02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:35.920
It's unclear.

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:41.040
Even before, but sometimes the heel can slip because it's because something's popped.

02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:43.200
So it's unclear what happened there.

02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:45.200
There seems to be a reaction from the part of the opponent.

02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.880
Like it definitely did some damage.

02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:49.520
So Gary goes back for a second one.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.360
And again, you get that same kind of pressure.

02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:54.680
Oh no.

02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:55.360
All right.

02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:58.160
But I like, I like, I like the Irish kid's reaction though.

02:23:58.160 --> 02:23:59.240
He's just like, you know what?

02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:01.840
Let me eat this cause I'm going to win this match and I'm going to be a

02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:03.040
legend for beating Gary Turner.

02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:08.600
So I admire this internal fortitude and, um, but now Gary knows he's lost it.

02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:14.240
So it, there's a sense there in which you see how close it gets in these

02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:16.560
situations, how little there is between winner and loser.

02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:20.840
And sometimes you just get these heartbreaking, um, uh, situations where

02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:24.800
someone who ordinarily you would probably do very well against and you

02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:30.040
make one mistake and it's an, it's an unrewarding, uncompromising sport.

02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:31.400
One mistake can be fatal.

02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:35.440
In class, you talked about escapes or arm locks and applies here as well.

02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:41.040
Uh, so you were teaching armlock escapes and I think, uh, uh, uh, choke escapes

02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:45.480
and, and the question came up, but when should an athlete not tap and

02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:46.800
risk that arm being broken?

02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.200
And you quoted George Patton as of course you would, uh, that no bastard

02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:53.120
ever won a war by dying for his country.

02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:56.200
He won it by making some other bastard die for his country.

02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:00.320
So what's your view on when to tap and when not to tap in competition?

02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:06.840
First off in training, you should be tapping very early because, um, uh, you

02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:09.800
know, getting paid to fight in the gym, you're getting paid to fight on stage.

02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:13.960
So be a professional in the gym, tap early, tap fast.

02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:17.720
That way you'll, you'll last a lot longer in competition.

02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:18.680
Things are a little different.

02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:21.480
We also have to specify what is the situation.

02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:21.720
Okay.

02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:25.560
If you're in the first round of ADCC, your first match, you get caught.

02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:32.920
I would always expect my students to tap because if you get your leg

02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:36.600
broken or your arm broken in the first round, you still got three more matches

02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:40.720
where you get to the final, there's a escape clause there is if you're a guy

02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:44.640
from Ireland and you're fighting the number one seed, there is, there's

02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:45.640
always an escape clause.

02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:45.800
Yeah.

02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:47.840
Like let it snap.

02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:48.040
Yeah.

02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:48.560
Let it go.

02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:53.520
But, um, uh, yeah, I would expect them to tap.

02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:58.320
Um, I also think that if you're in a stranglehold, it doesn't make a lot of

02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:01.400
sense and not tapping cause you, you're going to pass out.

02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:09.440
Like it's like you said in chess, it's kind of impolite to make the guy take

02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:10.640
it through to its conclusion.

02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:15.880
So, um, I don't see any heroism and just letting yourself pass out.

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:19.320
Um, now things change when you get into a final.

02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:28.560
If you're in a final and you're ahead on points and you're willing to, most

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:31.520
people at that point are going to be willing to let something break in

02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:32.680
order to win a gold medal.

02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:35.640
At that point, I leave it up to the student.

02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:38.320
Uh, it's a deeply personal decision.

02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:42.160
I would never say to a student, I expect you to let your body break

02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:44.280
in order to, to win a gold medal.

02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:48.880
Um, I think my students are more than mature enough to make up their own minds.

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.880
Uh, I would be angry if they let their bodies break in a meaningless fashion

02:26:55.200 --> 02:27:00.320
in some random tournament, um, or in a first round match where there's no way

02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:05.440
you could go on to, to the second, third and fourth matches with a broken limb.

02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:12.800
Um, but in a final, in a gold medal match in ADCC, I would leave the decision

02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:16.520
to them, a spontaneous decision in the moment, I would be confident that I had

02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:22.400
prepared them to do their very best to defend themselves, um, but what ultimately

02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:28.600
they do is their decision and winning ADCC is for a grappler, at least life

02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:31.960
changing, you're a world champion forever and no one can ever take

02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:33.160
that moment away from you.

02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:39.040
So I would, I would understand if they took a decision to take damage.

02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:42.200
Hopefully it will never come to that because I do a good job of preparing

02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:43.640
people to get out of situations.

02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:47.040
As you saw with Gary Turner, it was in a dreadful situation

02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:48.440
and got out within five seconds.

02:27:50.760 --> 02:27:52.400
Gary's been in armlocks.

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:55.280
It looked like even I was in the corner going like, Oh my God, what is

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.200
happening here and still got out.

02:27:57.200 --> 02:28:01.840
So, uh, it comes down to training preparation, but if they did make that

02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:06.880
decision, I would understand provided it was a situation that would make their

02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:10.880
lives better and they made a calculation, it's not an emotional thing.

02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:15.040
Now, sometimes you get emotional, you fight a guy you just don't like, and

02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:16.440
you just don't want to tap to them.

02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:21.080
Um, then things get a little more interesting.

02:28:21.080 --> 02:28:24.680
Like then again, it's a personal decision.

02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:27.800
If you hate someone so much that you literally can't even conceive of

02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:31.920
yourself submitting to them, probably best you don't get into matches

02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:33.000
with them in the first place.

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:37.960
Um, but if it should happen, um, again, it comes down to the student.

02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:40.160
I teach technique, not morals.

02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:43.160
So I let people make their own decisions on that.

02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:45.040
My thing is, look, don't get injured.

02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:46.400
Cause if you're injured, you can't train.

02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:46.960
You can't train.

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:47.720
You can't get better.

02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:50.320
So stay away from injury as much as you can.

02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:55.960
So one of the other incredible stories here is, as you mentioned, Nicholas

02:28:55.960 --> 02:29:03.440
Marigalli, one of the, uh, incredible GEE athletes in Jiu-Jitsu world, not

02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:08.200
ever having done no GEE training or competition and so on in a period of a

02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:13.680
year, actually significantly less than a year, Nicholas only came about, uh,

02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:18.040
six months, I believe before ADCC as a phone call came from Gordon.

02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:20.960
He was just like, okay, Nicholas wants to come down and train.

02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:21.960
He wants to move to Austin.

02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:24.200
So he came down.

02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:24.960
It was, it was funny.

02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:27.240
I remember the first day Nicholas came in.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.440
Nicholas Marigalli, as you can see, he's like this tall, handsome, Brazilian

02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:36.600
guy with a great personality and a wonderful smile, also super nice guy.

02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:40.160
So he comes in, he sits down on the mat and we're all kind of looking at the

02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:42.760
new guy and introducing ourselves.

02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:46.280
And I look at him, I go, buddy, what the fuck are you doing here?

02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:48.400
And he's like, what do you mean?

02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:53.040
And I go like, look at you, you're like tall and good looking.

02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:54.800
You should be a fucking model, not a Jiu-Jitsu guy.

02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:55.240
Look at us.

02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:58.960
We're all fucked up with horrible bodies and bad personalities.

02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:01.200
You're like a, you're like a happy, good looking guy.

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:02.640
You should be surrounded by supermodels.

02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:03.920
What are you doing Jiu-Jitsu for?

02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:06.720
And he just laughed and he started training with us.

02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:15.680
So he came in now, historically he has been an athlete who always pulled

02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:21.160
guard in Jiu-Jitsu parlance for your viewers, in Jiu-Jitsu you have the

02:30:21.160 --> 02:30:22.760
option of sitting down to the ground.

02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:25.040
Jiu-Jitsu was mostly performed on the ground.

02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:28.240
You can, and many athletes take advantage of this, that he's come out and sit to

02:30:28.240 --> 02:30:31.960
the ground position and completely forego takedowns.

02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:34.920
Nicholas did this his entire career.

02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:38.040
Jiu-Jitsu also has practiced both Gi and no Gi.

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:43.560
Nicholas was a shining light in the Gi side of Jiu-Jitsu.

02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:47.640
He was one of the great champions of his era, but he had not only never

02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:50.920
competed without a Gi, he had never even trained without a Gi.

02:30:51.480 --> 02:30:54.800
So there's significant differences between the two.

02:30:54.800 --> 02:30:57.760
There's a lot of overlap, but there's also some very significant differences.

02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:02.280
We're talking about a sport where even small differences can make a difference

02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:06.760
between a guy who gets the gold medal versus a guy who loses his first match.

02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:08.320
Um, it doesn't take a lot.

02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:13.520
So this was a very, very tall order.

02:31:14.080 --> 02:31:14.240
Yeah.

02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:17.160
A lot of his attacks involve the Gi from the guard.

02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:17.560
Absolutely.

02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:19.080
He's in a very dangerous attack.

02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:22.200
I mean, he doesn't just wear the Gi, he really uses the Gi.

02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:25.640
Like his 90% of what he's based around is based around a combination

02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:29.400
of cross and straight collar controls with, with the control of the sleeve cuff.

02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:32.720
And so he really actively uses the Gi.

02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:35.920
So when it came off, his first training decisions were like, Oh, it's

02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:37.520
like a fish out of water.

02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:40.960
Um, in addition, he had no experience of leg locking.

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:45.240
So one of the most significant parts of the modern game, he just had nothing.

02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:53.240
Um, he had literally zero wrestling, which is half of ADCC is based around this.

02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:58.960
So ADCC is like six months away and he has to get ready for the Gi world

02:31:58.960 --> 02:31:59.600
championships.

02:31:59.600 --> 02:32:04.240
He, Nicholas had won many accolades in Gi judo, but he had never won.

02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:07.800
The open weight division of Gi worlds.

02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:13.000
So he's like the first day he's there, he's like, John, I want to be the first guy

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:20.880
to win Gi open weight and ADCC open weight in the same year.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:21.200
Yeah.

02:32:23.480 --> 02:32:29.840
I'm like, I'm like, um, yeah.

02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:33.800
Uh, now in my mind, I'm thinking like, yeah, that's never going to

02:32:33.800 --> 02:32:34.440
fucking happen.

02:32:34.440 --> 02:32:35.240
You're fucking weirdo.

02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:40.520
Do you think there was a degree to which he actually believed that as a degree?

02:32:41.440 --> 02:32:42.960
He thought it was like a certainty.

02:32:43.720 --> 02:32:45.920
So he's looking at me like, yeah, I'm going to do this.

02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:50.520
So I'm like, you know, well, Nicholas, this is, uh, this is very laudable.

02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:52.880
And, and I approve of your confidence.

02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:55.160
And, um, but this is a difficult goal.

02:32:55.160 --> 02:32:59.680
You've set yourself perhaps maybe like 2024 would be a more realistic, right?

02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:01.120
He's like, no, no, I'm going to do it.

02:33:01.640 --> 02:33:06.760
In all seriousness, it is incredible that, uh, Nicholas Maragalli had the

02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:09.640
guts to set such a nearly impossible goal.

02:33:10.120 --> 02:33:15.360
Uh, so what do you learn from this experience of setting a goal that most

02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:19.960
people would say is just unachievable and him actually almost doing it?

02:33:20.440 --> 02:33:21.520
It's on the surface.

02:33:21.520 --> 02:33:22.520
That's absolutely crazy.

02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:27.000
Like when he's mentioned the goal to me, I was, as I said, just looking at him

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.400
and almost like disbelief, I didn't want to show it on my face.

02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:33.280
Um, and yet he came within inches of actually doing it.

02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:38.520
He won his first ever gold in the open weight with the ghee and got to the

02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:45.440
finals, uh, and lost a tight decision in the finals and to take a silver medal.

02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:46.360
He wanted two goals.

02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:47.360
He got a gold and a silver.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:53.240
And there's a sense in which the sheer audaciousness of, of, of the goal

02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:59.160
set seemed ludicrous when it first happened is a, this is, this is insanity.

02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:01.520
And yet he came at it with a plan.

02:34:01.520 --> 02:34:05.440
He came at it with his characteristic passion and hard work and came

02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:06.880
within inches of doing so.

02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:11.320
And there's a sense in which you could look at it as, oh, he had a plan and it

02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:15.560
failed, and yet of course no one in their right mind would look at it.

02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:19.880
That was a, he set an audacious goal so high that it seemed impossible.

02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:24.400
And it pulled his entire performance up to a level where even failure

02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:26.240
creates something truly memorable.

02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:33.600
Do you encourage athletes or do you, uh, not get in their way when they set such

02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:37.080
a goal, maybe even just forget athletes, human nature?

02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:38.680
Yeah, that's a great question.

02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:43.000
Um, there's a sense in which, you know, you don't want to make

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.400
people delusional that that's sad.

02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:52.960
But I do believe that if people are sufficiently embedded in a given project,

02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:57.520
if they committed to it to a certain degree, then you can skimp on many

02:34:57.520 --> 02:34:59.680
things in life, but don't skimp on your goals.

02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:00.600
Okay.

02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:03.560
Because the bigger your goals, the bigger your achievements will be.

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:09.560
And even failure, as we saw in the case of Nicholas Mirigali, I almost frowned

02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:13.280
use the word failure because if this is failure, give me more of it, you know.

02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:19.560
Falling slightly short of falling short of, um, of what would otherwise be a

02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:27.440
perfect year, um, even that still creates such a massive, uh, uptick in

02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:32.600
your performance that it's absolutely the right way to go, but there is a

02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:36.880
danger to this where people aren't committed and simply aren't working from

02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:42.000
a framework where they can realistically achieve these things, then it descends

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.080
into delusion and that direction goes towards madness.

02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:45.840
You can't have that.

02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:52.400
So there has to be some kind of reality check here where you have to be, uh,

02:35:52.880 --> 02:35:58.240
uh, physically and mentally capable to some degree of moving towards these goals.

02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:03.200
You can't just, you know, uh, a random blue belt can't make audacious goals like

02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:09.560
that, it's just ludicrous, but, um, uh, with, with that in mind, if, if you're

02:36:09.920 --> 02:36:13.640
committed and, and, and you, there's a sense in which this is a definite

02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:15.960
possibility, set your goals high.

02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:16.760
Okay.

02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:17.640
Make big demands.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:19.520
Yes, there'll be times of frustration.

02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:23.160
There'll be more failure in your lives than otherwise, but even your failures

02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:25.440
will be something great, something memorable.

02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:31.520
See, but in the near term, you would be hard pressed to find any data that

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:36.280
justifies that goal because in his case, he, he probably wasn't very good at

02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:38.440
Nogi in the, even in the training room.

02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:44.200
So it's, it's like, where do you look for even inklings of hope?

02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:49.160
Uh, we saw an incremental progress with each successive competition that he was

02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:55.400
in, um, his first competition, uh, uh, he looked good, but not great.

02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:57.600
Second competition, a little better.

02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:02.400
Third competition took on one of the legends of, uh, American

02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:03.800
grappling and one decisively.

02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:07.600
So there was a sense in which it was becoming more realistic with each outing.

02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:12.520
So now, now putting that inspiring philosophy aside, what was the

02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:14.800
actual plan on how to make it happen?

02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:16.880
So, so the leg locks.

02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:18.640
Same thing with John Carlo.

02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:20.280
First, you gotta learn how to defend a leg lock.

02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:26.640
So, um, uh, initially just as John Carlo struggled, he struggled.

02:37:27.120 --> 02:37:31.640
Uh, then he had to learn not just takedowns, but just how to set up a

02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:35.600
take, I had to learn basics, like stance and motion and how to fight

02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:36.920
with the hands, et cetera, et cetera.

02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:44.000
So he had to learn from the ground up and, um, uh, then he had to improve.

02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:47.360
He always had a very good triangle, always had very good arm bar.

02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:50.240
Those were his two strengths coming into the Nogi training.

02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:52.920
And those translate pretty well between Gi and Nogi.

02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.200
Um, but he had no guillotine.

02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:59.880
He had no, uh, strangles from the back where he has great collar strangles

02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:03.200
in the back, but he really, really struggled with finishing people from the back.

02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:06.400
So, um, he's, he's learning all this.

02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:09.680
And, uh, then he's like, well, now I've got to get ready for the Gi.

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:12.840
So we had to switch his training to, to Gi training.

02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:15.520
And, uh, that took out a couple of months.

02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:18.960
Then he got, he went back briefly to Brazil and got a terrible rib

02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:22.440
injury right before the world championships and came back like

02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:24.240
more or less unable to move.

02:38:24.640 --> 02:38:28.800
So the world championships is a week away and he, he's like, John, I can't move.

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:31.200
So I'm like, what are you going to do?

02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:32.120
He said, I'm going to compete.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:35.200
So I'm like, are you sure?

02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:37.120
So we fly to California.

02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:41.400
He goes out, competes his first opponent is literally the biggest

02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:43.120
man who competes in jiu-jitsu.

02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:46.640
He sees this man is almost like 400 pounds.

02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:48.760
Nicholas has got completely broken ribs.

02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:51.600
We're taping up his ribs backstage before he goes out to compete.

02:38:52.240 --> 02:38:57.880
He beats everyone by submission and wins for the first time, the open

02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:02.360
weight, um, uh, a title he had never won before.

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:05.120
He steps off the mat and looks at me.

02:39:05.120 --> 02:39:06.800
He goes, well, I got the first of them.

02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:12.560
He wanted open weight and now ADCC and now we can barely move.

02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:15.280
He's still gone through two days of brutal competition and his ribs are

02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:20.840
completely screwed up, takes a week off to try and get his ribs somewhere back

02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:24.240
in order and then begins light training, building up to ADCC.

02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:27.000
We start putting him in no-gi competition.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.560
He, uh, he fights two opponents of, uh, good quality, but not

02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:35.120
like world beating quality.

02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:39.920
And then, um, as his game starts improving, we're getting closer and closer.

02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:43.800
He's starting to develop a sense where he can wrestle confidently on his feet.

02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:49.080
He's no longer easy to leglock at all.

02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:54.160
And it's starting to leglock people and it's starting to get his very strong

02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:59.160
guard passing, uh, which was based mostly around pant grips and the

02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:03.040
gi to adapt to leg, no gi grips.

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:07.680
Um, in addition, he's starting to develop strong chest to chest positioning,

02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:10.560
which was never really part of his game of pressure top game.

02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:16.040
And, um, uh, so things are looking good.

02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:21.840
He's matched against Rafael Lovato, one of the great competitors of, of ADCC

02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:26.800
and wins a convincing victory featuring a lot of takedowns and a lot of pressure

02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:29.960
passing and people were just absolutely shocked.

02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:34.400
I remember the staff of flow grappling coming and going like, who is this guy?

02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:36.080
He's like, he's literally transformed.

02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:37.120
He's like a different person.

02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:42.440
So he goes into the world championships in his weight division.

02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:48.360
He was matched, uh, with a fellow Brazilian in the first match and, uh, they

02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:52.600
had an absolute barn burning battle where at one point Nicholas was picked up

02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:56.120
and slammed and then ended up winning by Kimura, a beautiful Kimura.

02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:00.760
Um, then he took on the man who ultimately wins.

02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:04.240
ADCC open weight division and defeats him.

02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:08.320
Uh, yeah, tough, tough match.

02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.960
Now, Yuri Samoia at that stage was two time gold medalist in ADCC.

02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:17.000
Nicholas wins a very, very close match against him and then fights Craig

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.920
Jones, who's one of the best leg lockers in the, in the world.

02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:25.040
So I think most people were expecting Nicholas to get leg locked very easily by Craig.

02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:30.440
Um, Nicholas showed the degree to which he had improved his leg lock

02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:32.800
defense in a six month period.

02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:37.160
Craig never really got close to the legs and ended up becoming a takedown

02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:38.520
battle could have gone either way.

02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:42.320
Uh, Craig, I thought that a really good job of, of pacing himself.

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:47.920
He, both athletes were very tired, but, uh, uh, Nicholas was a head on points.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:52.520
And then Craig had one last takedown, which sat Nicholas down to a hip, didn't

02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:57.000
score, but it was the most aggressive takedown of that last period.

02:41:57.440 --> 02:42:00.080
And so Nicholas got the nod and won a narrow victory.

02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:01.000
Yeah.

02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:05.600
Uh, Craig commented, uh, afterwards, he said that I really wanted the submission

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.200
and he said Nicholas seemed to really wanted the submission, but it ended up

02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:16.320
being a grueling match and took everything like, uh, exhaustion wise, everything he had.

02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:20.040
It was a, it was a tough, tough match and, um, they were very well matched.

02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:22.360
Once they figured out they couldn't submit each other, it came down to

02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:23.880
their, their wrestling ability.

02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:28.200
Neither one of them was a wrestling specialist, but they both competent and,

02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:33.680
and, and, uh, and wrestling and, um, it became physically very, very tough.

02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:38.400
Um, then Nicholas went on to win the bronze medal in his weight division.

02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:42.880
So the next day, when we get called for the open weight, obviously

02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:44.600
John Carlo had won a gold medal.

02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:49.480
Uh, the, um, everyone agreed that he should go into open weight.

02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:51.280
Oh, did John Carlo agree?

02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:56.960
Of course he was, I mean, like, cause he didn't have an easy format.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.600
You don't order people into it.

02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:01.040
You ask them, but he was, he was delighted.

02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:05.080
I guess the question I'm asking is how do you find the strength to

02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:07.000
then go on to absolutely after.

02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:12.080
Because you've done a 14 week training camp where every day was

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:14.480
just as intense as any ADCC day.

02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:15.880
So you're used to it at that point.

02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:19.120
But he had very, very long, tough matches.

02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:20.960
But, uh, he's, he's used to it.

02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:21.880
He's a good athlete.

02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:28.600
Um, so Nicholas and John Carlo went out and, um, John Carlo had a spectacular

02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:30.640
submission victory against his first opponent.

02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:38.240
Um, Nicholas had some, uh, uh, some firework matches and one of the toughest

02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:42.520
opponents he came up against was the brilliant Ty Ruotolo.

02:43:42.760 --> 02:43:44.800
Um, they had an absolute barn burner.

02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:51.920
It was a very, very close match and, uh, Ty had had an incredible, uh, first two

02:43:51.920 --> 02:43:55.760
matches he'd beaten Pedro Mourinho by submission and he'd beaten the great

02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:00.200
Felipe Pena, um, in a very narrow match, very, very tight.

02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:01.760
Felipe lost on a guard pole.

02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:06.120
Um, but Felipe is considerably bigger and stronger than Ty.

02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:11.960
So for Ty to, to win that match, even by a guard pole was deeply impressive.

02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:14.880
It was a, it was an action packed match that went back and forth.

02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:16.080
Very, very impressive.

02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:17.440
Can I ask you something on a small tangent?

02:44:17.440 --> 02:44:17.640
Yeah.

02:44:17.960 --> 02:44:20.480
Both the Ruotolo brothers had an incredible performance.

02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:22.680
Uh, what do you think makes them so good?

02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:26.280
If you were to analyze their game sort of outside of you and just this

02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:29.480
specific match, um, there's, there's a range of factors.

02:44:29.480 --> 02:44:32.360
One is that they, they started the sport very, very young.

02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:40.680
They're probably the first example in American grappling of American students

02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:42.760
who started at age four or five.

02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:48.600
Most people, when I began jiu-jitsu, started jiu-jitsu as adults.

02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:52.000
I was 28 years old when I had my first lesson as a white belt.

02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:56.480
So, um, uh, in time people got a little younger.

02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:02.080
For example, Nikki Ryan started when I think when he was 12, but, um, uh, the

02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:06.080
Ruotolo started when they were literally children, they had excellent coaching

02:45:06.080 --> 02:45:08.720
going all the way up through into their teenage years.

02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:14.720
Um, so they had the advantage of, of starting the way so many successful

02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:20.920
athletes do as, as children and going up through, uh, uh, adulthood and with

02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:24.280
strong coaching all along the way, excellent parental support.

02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:32.120
So they had like a, a great history where they, their youth didn't show off

02:45:32.120 --> 02:45:33.920
just how long they'd been in the sport.

02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:38.040
Uh, so you're, you're dealing with a kid who's 19 years old, but he's

02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:39.640
been grappling for 15 years.

02:45:40.280 --> 02:45:47.360
And, uh, what counts is not your age, but your mat age and quality.

02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:52.520
Yeah, they were very young in years, but they were very old in mat age.

02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:57.520
And, um, but there's a lot of athletes that have now, as you correctly said,

02:45:58.120 --> 02:46:03.320
have spent from a very early age on the mat, but still these particular

02:46:03.320 --> 02:46:04.840
ones stand out, it's interesting.

02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:06.400
Yeah, no, there's a lot more to it than that.

02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:10.920
This is just the first setting the scene, but what really makes them stand out

02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:19.560
is that they've mastered this idea of, of covering up and improving initial

02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:21.960
weaknesses while building upon strengths.

02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:26.640
When the Rua Tolos first encountered my students, they were relatively easy to

02:46:26.720 --> 02:46:30.400
leg lock because none of their training experience had prepared them for that.

02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:37.680
Um, now they were, uh, they were young at that time, I believe like 16 or 17.

02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:41.640
And, uh, it was an obvious problem for them.

02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:49.360
They both got heel hooked, um, by my, uh, youngsters also, um, Nikki

02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:50.800
Ryan and Ethan Kralenstein.

02:46:51.280 --> 02:47:00.360
And, um, you could clearly see that they identified their current weakness and

02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:05.040
made prodigious steps to improve upon it to a point now where they're winning

02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:07.480
championships with their own leg locks.

02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:12.400
Like, I love the fact that even as teenagers, they had the maturity to say,

02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:13.720
okay, here's an obvious weakness.

02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:14.800
Let's get around this.

02:47:14.800 --> 02:47:16.080
Let's turn it into a strength.

02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:20.720
Um, I love the way they did that and focusing on the weakness and let that

02:47:20.720 --> 02:47:24.120
guide you to the thing you're working on, but they also, they, they, they

02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:29.080
covered up their weaknesses, but they also understood what are our actual strengths.

02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:34.880
Now, physically, both of the brothers have extraordinary reach for their height.

02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:38.520
They both have extraordinarily long arms for their height.

02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:45.320
That means that variations of Katakatame in particular, Dases, Anacondas, uh,

02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:49.320
are going to be much easier for them and their weight division than for most people.

02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:50.280
These are all chokes.

02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:50.760
Yes.

02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:51.600
Strangleholds.

02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:54.040
So they specialize in those.

02:47:54.440 --> 02:48:01.320
They adapted a game based around movement, which forces opponents, not

02:48:01.360 --> 02:48:05.880
with physical pressure, but with tactical pressure into positions, which expose

02:48:05.880 --> 02:48:09.160
them to those specialized strangleholds that they use.

02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:16.000
Um, traditionally, when we, when we looked at the Rua Talas, when they were young,

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:19.200
we saw that there was a disparity between their top game and their bottom game.

02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:22.800
They were generally much better in top position than they were in bottom position.

02:48:23.400 --> 02:48:28.480
Again, they saw that as a, as a potential weakness and they turned it around using

02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:35.600
again, their unique long limbs relative to their height and they make use of a

02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:39.040
buggy strangle, I'm not sure why it's referred to as a buggy strangle, but it's

02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:42.400
in it, but basically it's a variation of Katakatame using the legs done from

02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:44.120
disadvantageous positions on bottom.

02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:49.560
And they both make brilliant use of that to not so much as a strangle weapon.

02:48:49.560 --> 02:48:52.240
Occasionally they'll strangle someone with it, but they mostly use it to

02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:54.280
create pressure to make people back off.

02:48:54.840 --> 02:49:00.240
And as a result, they're able to, uh, they overcame the disparity between

02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:01.640
their top game and their bottom game.

02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:05.360
Now their bottom game is part of their offense and they're very, very successful

02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:05.800
from there.

02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:11.080
And so again, you had that, that really impressive sense in which they identified

02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:14.600
their weaknesses and leg locks and bottom position, turned it around and made it

02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:19.080
into strengths and at the same time, they identified, okay, what, what are our

02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:22.040
physical gifts and how can we maximize their use?

02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:25.760
And they created a program of initiating movement that created tactical rather

02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:28.600
than physical pressure to set up their best strangleholds.

02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:31.280
Um, I deeply admire what they've done.

02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:34.320
That's two young men have a huge future ahead of them.

02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:38.920
And so here, uh, one of the brothers faces, uh, in the, in the absolute

02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:45.920
Nicholas Murigali and, uh, tie has just fought two very tough matches against

02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:47.680
guys bigger and stronger than himself.

02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:51.000
So he's coming into a third match against a third guy who's also

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:52.160
bigger than he is.

02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:57.440
So, uh, hats off to tie fighting open weight against three monsters in a row.

02:49:57.960 --> 02:50:03.600
Um, now tie and Kate, one of their best attributes is they are two of the

02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:05.600
best scramblers in the sport of jujitsu.

02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:11.000
So whenever you go to shoot on the legs with them, there's a danger of running

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.800
straight into a dark stranglehold.

02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:15.760
They're very competent at counter-attacking single legs with dark

02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:16.280
strangles.

02:50:16.840 --> 02:50:20.960
Um, it's also very hard to control them after a takedown.

02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:23.800
They do a very good job of springing back up to the feet.

02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:28.680
So I, uh, told Nicholas to favor upper body judo based takedowns rather

02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:29.760
than wrestling takedowns.

02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:33.840
And you see here a fine example of Nicholas's gathering skill in Uchamata,

02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:36.320
one of the great throws of, of judo.

02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:41.880
Set up with a, there's a bit of a foot on a foot sweep.

02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:47.520
Like, uh, the nice thing is he starts off with what it looks like.

02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:49.360
It's actually a two-directional Uchamata.

02:50:49.360 --> 02:50:52.080
He threatens, uh, Uchigari to the back.

02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:54.480
That's a throw that throws your opponent to the back.

02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:58.160
His opponent pushes into him, then he changes direction with a support foot

02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:00.080
and takes him over with Uchamata.

02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:05.000
As we said earlier, the great advantage of judo over wrestling is that because

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.680
there's upper body connection during the throw and after the throw, it's much

02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:13.400
harder for an opponent to scramble away from you and even Tai Ruotolo is one of

02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:19.400
the best scramblers in the sport has to stop scrambling here and just, uh, go

02:51:19.400 --> 02:51:23.200
back to guard position and enable Nicholas to, to hold top position.

02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:25.320
I mean, some of it is also the surprise.

02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:29.160
There is something less understandable about judo techniques because

02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:32.400
there's less data it feels like.

02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:34.760
The Ruotolos also have a good Uchamata.

02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:36.200
I think they're very familiar with it.

02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:39.520
How often do you think are they on the receiving end of an Uchamata?

02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:40.640
That's a good point.

02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:40.880
Yeah.

02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:41.120
Yeah.

02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:45.720
So I just feel like they have more data in terms of defending, um, I mean, of course

02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:50.040
there is fundamentals to the Uchamata that make it difficult to scramble around, but.

02:51:51.160 --> 02:51:54.840
This is a good example of someone who literally didn't have a single take down

02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:55.720
six months ago.

02:51:55.760 --> 02:51:58.880
Now he's throwing one of the toughest guys in the sport with one of the

02:51:58.880 --> 02:52:00.160
more difficult throws of judo.

02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:01.400
You're a judo man.

02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:01.680
Yeah.

02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:03.680
You're a judo master.

02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:05.080
You're a judo man.

02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:05.400
Yeah.

02:52:05.880 --> 02:52:07.240
You'll back me up on this.

02:52:07.240 --> 02:52:09.080
Uchamata is not an easy throw to learn.

02:52:09.080 --> 02:52:10.120
It takes some time.

02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:13.000
You're hopping on one foot with both of your body weight supported.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:13.840
It's very counter-intuitive.

02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:14.520
Yeah.

02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:17.600
It's one of the more difficult throws.

02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:22.520
Let go of your understanding of, uh, takedowns of maybe wrestling style

02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:26.360
takedowns or more intuitive kind of takedowns to understand it.

02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:28.160
There's many throws like this.

02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:29.360
Uchigari is like this.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:31.480
Sotogari is like this.

02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:32.600
Uchamata is like this.

02:52:32.600 --> 02:52:33.320
It's weird.

02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:34.240
What?

02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:35.280
I'm on one foot.

02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:36.240
I'm hopping around.

02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:38.480
This makes no sense, but it works.

02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:40.360
Foot sweeps are also weird in that way.

02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:44.440
They're a little bit more intuitive, but like to get very good at foot sweeps,

02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:47.080
you have to understand timing, weight distribution.

02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:50.360
It's a, it's a dynamic thing.

02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:51.160
That's weird.

02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:54.800
You have to, I always laugh when I talk to Nicholas and I say, you

02:52:54.800 --> 02:53:00.560
know, I try to teach him a single leg, which is traditionally most, you know,

02:53:00.560 --> 02:53:03.600
like a high single leg is one of the easier takedowns to perform in terms

02:53:03.600 --> 02:53:08.080
of mechanical difficulty and Nicholas always struggles with it.

02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:11.880
And then I teach him one of the more difficult takedowns, Uchamata, and

02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:13.840
he does it flawlessly.

02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:16.320
Yeah, you never know, certain things get attached.

02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:21.200
I mean, you see this in Judo, it's kind of interesting to see there's classes

02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:27.320
of takedowns and certain people just gravitate in their philosophical,

02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:30.120
intuitive understanding of body mechanics or something like this.

02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:32.360
It's like Seinage versus Uchamata.

02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:37.760
You very clearly see there's some people that understand they like to have both

02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:43.040
their feet planted on the ground and there's some people that are okay with

02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:47.040
this one foot on the ground and the other one is doing something else.

02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:50.120
And I think that, I don't know what that, what is that?

02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:50.560
I don't know.

02:53:50.560 --> 02:53:53.040
It's what makes you fall in love with one field versus another.

02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:57.840
So what, can you speak to that, that, you know, you've released a new

02:53:57.840 --> 02:54:03.800
instructional on takedowns and standing skills for Jiu-Jitsu, just at a high

02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:11.840
level, using Nicholas as an example, what are some key ideas about takedowns?

02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:13.000
Okay.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:17.920
First, whenever people talk about standing position in Jiu-Jitsu, they

02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:23.560
always say, oh, I need to learn some takedowns, but it's never a question

02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:26.680
of just learning the takedowns, it's learning the prerequisites to the

02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:30.200
takedowns, the takedowns are more or less like an afterthought.

02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:37.640
You've got to begin with stance, motion, the ability to engage in grip and

02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:42.400
contact, get your opponent out of balance, and then comes the takedowns.

02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:46.960
The takedowns in Jiu-Jitsu are mostly divided into lower body takedowns,

02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:51.120
tackles to the legs, single legs, double legs, to a lesser degree, high

02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:57.680
crouch in Jiu-Jitsu, and then upper body takedowns, which are mostly judo derived.

02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:03.840
Nicholas had to start more or less at the ground, I mean, he didn't even know

02:55:03.840 --> 02:55:08.760
how to come out and make grips or hold a stance, so he had to learn every element

02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:13.960
of it, and the fact he was able to do so in six months was just incredible.

02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:19.400
Can you comment on the upward posture?

02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:21.080
That seems to work for Jiu-Jitsu.

02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:24.400
The matches in Jiu-Jitsu are much longer than the matches in wrestling.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:28.680
In addition, there are many kinds of submission threat, which are not there

02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:31.400
in wrestling, so the stance has to be significantly changed.

02:55:31.920 --> 02:55:36.120
In wrestling, they favor generally a very low crouch because the vast majority

02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:41.080
of attacks are tackles to the legs, so anyone who stands upright in wrestling

02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:45.160
tends to get heavily punished by being taken down immediately with a leg tackle.

02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:51.240
In Jiu-Jitsu, the matches are so much longer, it would be difficult in a 40-minute

02:55:51.240 --> 02:55:55.240
match, for example, to maintain a bent over crouch, you'd be exhausted.

02:55:56.200 --> 02:55:58.800
There's also problems associated with submission holds.

02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:02.320
There are many forms of submission hold, guillotines, darts, et cetera, where if

02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:05.000
your head comes down too low, you become a little vulnerable to this.

02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:10.760
And so the stances in Jiu-Jitsu competition tend to be much more upright,

02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:12.080
more like Judo and Greco.

02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:15.120
So right off the bat, you see the stance is different.

02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:18.720
The motion tends to be much slower and more evenly paced because you've got to

02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:20.600
be able to do this for long periods of time.

02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:25.880
So the number of fakes per minute, the number of shots attempted per minute

02:56:25.880 --> 02:56:27.520
is usually much lower.

02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:32.120
So these are obvious differences.

02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:35.600
The biggest difference, however, has nothing to do with that,

02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:36.800
it has to do with tactics.

02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:45.640
In Jiu-Jitsu, the scores will be judged by what happens after the takedown.

02:56:46.680 --> 02:56:53.800
In the case of ADCC, you can take someone down in ways that would score in both

02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:58.800
wrestling and Judo and possibly even win the match in the case of Judo, and it

02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:03.280
would score zero in ADCC because of the nature of the rules.

02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:10.280
The whole idea of ADCC scoring is to demonstrate control after the takedown.

02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:13.440
It's what happens in the critical three seconds after the takedown

02:57:13.760 --> 02:57:15.040
that creates the score.

02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:22.720
In Judo and in wrestling, the emphasis is based on the takedown itself.

02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:27.360
In Jiu-Jitsu, the emphasis is placed on the aftermath of the takedown.

02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:28.960
That's where the score is allocated.

02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:32.960
And that can be a period of up to three seconds.

02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:36.480
Now, three seconds doesn't sound like much, but in a scramble after a takedown,

02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:38.320
three seconds is a fucking eternity.

02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:40.000
It goes on forever.

02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:45.720
And so you will see many examples of takedowns that, as I said, would score

02:57:46.280 --> 02:57:51.200
very well in Judo and wrestling, but don't score at all in ADCC.

02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:57.640
And so the whole skill becomes packaging the standing position in terms of the

02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:02.240
takedowns themselves, but in particular, preparing the athletes for that critical

02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:04.160
three seconds after the takedown.

02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:09.640
That's why many people who are very fine wrestlers struggle in ADCC.

02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:14.160
They take people down by wrestling metric all the time, but don't

02:58:14.160 --> 02:58:15.760
score under ADCC rules.

02:58:16.640 --> 02:58:18.800
What makes GSB so good at takedowns?

02:58:19.120 --> 02:58:21.920
I've gotten GSB even recently watched him do takedowns.

02:58:22.240 --> 02:58:26.320
Is it within this framework that you're teaching?

02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:29.560
What stands out to you about him that you draw lessons from?

02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:34.840
Yeah, that's another example of someone who's performing takedowns in a

02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:37.400
rule set radically different from wrestling.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:43.440
Just as the ADCC rule set is so different from conventional wrestling

02:58:43.440 --> 02:58:49.000
rule sets, that the whole manner in which you approach takedowns and even

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:53.960
your understanding of takedowns has to be quite strongly modified.

02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:56.280
So to an MMA, it's even more extreme.

02:58:56.800 --> 02:58:59.480
People always think, oh, this guy's a good wrestler.

02:58:59.480 --> 02:59:01.480
He should be able to get takedowns in MMA easily.

02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:08.120
What you find is that the wrestling skills in MMA enable you to finish takedowns.

02:59:08.240 --> 02:59:12.360
If you get in on your opponent and get to the legs or the waist or what have you,

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:18.120
your wrestling skill will enable you to finish the takedown, but getting to the

02:59:18.120 --> 02:59:23.520
takedown is massively different in the context of MMA than it is in wrestling.

02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:25.440
The entire stance is different.

02:59:27.160 --> 02:59:29.280
The entire set of distancing is different.

02:59:29.920 --> 02:59:33.680
There's the idea of positioning within a cage, like how close you are to

02:59:33.680 --> 02:59:38.840
the perimeter of the cage changes radically how you approach the takedown.

02:59:39.400 --> 02:59:43.040
The setups are literally night and day different.

02:59:43.040 --> 02:59:48.760
The setups are almost entirely composed of striking setups rather than grappling

02:59:48.760 --> 02:59:56.000
setups, and so the act of getting to the takedown is like a completely different

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:56.520
sport.

02:59:57.040 --> 03:00:02.800
Now, George studied wrestling and used to go to wrestling practice twice a week.

03:00:03.200 --> 03:00:05.160
In Canada, they do freestyle wrestling.

03:00:05.160 --> 03:00:07.280
They don't use the American college style of wrestling.

03:00:07.760 --> 03:00:11.760
Now, George's main emphasis in wrestling training was takedowns.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:17.360
Obviously the whole ground element of freestyle wrestling was of no interest

03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:21.520
to him, like learning how to put people's back on the ground and turn them with

03:00:21.560 --> 03:00:25.720
leg laces and gut wrenches was of no value in MMA.

03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:29.840
So he devoted almost all of his study to just the act of taking someone down.

03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:34.440
So as in pure wrestling, George is not bad.

03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:41.840
I think he would be a very competitive match even for a highly ranked American

03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:42.640
freestyle wrestler.

03:00:42.920 --> 03:00:46.000
Obviously he would lose easily on the ground because he's not used to the

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:46.520
par tier.

03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:51.200
He'd probably be leg laced or gut wrenched quite easily by a skilled opponent.

03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:55.560
But in just a pure takedown battle, he'd be a competitive training partner for

03:00:56.080 --> 03:01:01.560
even a good wrestler, but in actual MMA competition, he could take down even the

03:01:01.560 --> 03:01:06.400
most highly credentialed wrestlers and in some cases make it look almost effortless.

03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:13.520
And that came from his unification of striking skill with wrestling.

03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:19.520
So he used wrestling skills to finish the takedown and his karate and kickboxing

03:01:19.520 --> 03:01:22.000
pedigree to enter into the takedown.

03:01:22.640 --> 03:01:27.360
Now, when he initiated the study of this, this was at a time when MMA was pretty

03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:36.960
much in its infancy and he was one of the most impressive people I've ever seen

03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:37.520
in this regard.

03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:38.760
He was a true innovator.

03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:46.160
He innovated this specialized area of striking to a takedown to a greater

03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:47.800
degree than anyone else I'm aware of.

03:01:48.080 --> 03:01:50.720
Well, let me ask you about this innovation because you're one of the most

03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:54.160
innovative people in martial arts.

03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:59.480
There's several major categories of innovation that you have led.

03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:07.080
Obviously leg locks, body lock, now wrestling.

03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:12.360
What's your process of innovation?

03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:22.800
So seeing the problems in a particular system, the gaps, how do you identify

03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:26.840
them and how do you figure out systems of how to fill those gaps?

03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:35.880
First thing I look for is what are the current weaknesses in a given combat sport?

03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:41.680
So in the case of jiu-jitsu, it was very obvious that historically jiu-jitsu had

03:02:41.680 --> 03:02:47.440
always been weak in leg locking, jiu-jitsu had always been weak in standing position

03:02:47.440 --> 03:02:55.360
overall, and these were things that needed to be sorted out immediately.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:03:00.920
In its infancy, mixed martial arts was divided between grapplers and strikers.

03:03:04.480 --> 03:03:10.920
Most of the emphasis in early mixed martial arts was on the idea of specialists

03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:19.600
in a given domain, forcing the fight into their domain and that my early work

03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:24.720
with George St. Pierre convinced me that the right approach wasn't increased

03:03:24.720 --> 03:03:31.680
specialization and learning to force your athlete into that area of specialization

03:03:31.680 --> 03:03:36.200
at the expense of the opponent, but rather the real battles of the future

03:03:36.240 --> 03:03:43.560
would be won and lost not with techniques per se, specialized techniques, but rather

03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:50.000
the integration of techniques and the overlap between the various grappling and striking

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:57.880
skills so that someone who was an inferior grappler would have just enough grappling

03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:03.360
skills to be able to hold a grappler off and then defeat them with striking.

03:04:03.840 --> 03:04:11.400
If you went to fight someone who's superior to you in striking, you would have just enough

03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:15.040
striking skill to be able to hold them at bay and then enter into grappling.

03:04:15.680 --> 03:04:20.520
This went further and further until it got clear that there were whole areas of the

03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:27.520
sport that you needed to change your entire mindset about them so that people went into

03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:30.840
early MMA thinking in terms of grappler and striker.

03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:39.800
What I started to think is in terms of there are four fundamental skill areas of mixed

03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:48.640
martial arts. There is shoot boxing, which is the integration of takedowns and striking.

03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:54.920
There is clinch boxing, which is the integration of upper body clinch skills combined with striking.

03:04:54.920 --> 03:05:00.320
There is fence boxing, which the two athletes are locked up with each other on the fence.

03:05:00.320 --> 03:05:05.960
They have to integrate takedown, takedown defense, and striking skills.

03:05:05.960 --> 03:05:10.280
There is grapple boxing, which is the merging of ground grappling with striking.

03:05:10.280 --> 03:05:17.200
When you broke MMA down into those four categories, you saw that each one of those four domains

03:05:17.200 --> 03:05:26.000
transcends the specialized martial arts that form their components.

03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:33.680
For example, in clinch boxing, you would incorporate things from judo, Greco-Roman, freestyle, juditsu

03:05:33.680 --> 03:05:39.360
submissions, Muay Thai, clinching techniques.

03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:46.360
Even if you took all five of those, the rule set that you're operating in required such

03:05:46.780 --> 03:05:53.400
extensive modification that the final product of clinch boxing transcended all five of its

03:05:53.400 --> 03:06:00.320
component martial arts and became its own autonomous skill, needed to be worked autonomously.

03:06:00.320 --> 03:06:07.040
When we broke George's training down into those four areas, that's when real progress

03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:14.240
started to be made. That's when you started to see the integration of those four phases

03:06:14.240 --> 03:06:20.960
and the striking and grappling within each of them was where victory was being won and

03:06:20.960 --> 03:06:21.960
lost.

03:06:21.960 --> 03:06:29.920
If you reframe how you see a particular combat sport, then you can start doing these detailed

03:06:29.920 --> 03:06:34.040
development of ideas that actually fit.

03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:39.320
There's a sense in which it had to start with a paradigm shift and then a research program

03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:43.840
began after that. You don't start with research, you start with a paradigm shift and then went

03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:44.840
to research.

03:06:44.840 --> 03:06:51.320
Well, let me ask you, I got a chance to hang out with you and Hanzo Gracie at ADCC. He

03:06:51.320 --> 03:06:56.060
keeps messaging me saying he's going to call me and not calling me. I think aside from

03:06:56.060 --> 03:07:07.140
being hilarious, charismatic and handsome and wise for his young age, he's also one

03:07:07.140 --> 03:07:12.840
of the greatest coaches and athletes of all time in martial arts. Let me ask, what have

03:07:12.840 --> 03:07:16.760
you learned about life from Hanzo Gracie?

03:07:16.760 --> 03:07:25.600
The degree of difficulty that Hanzo must have encountered, he never talked to us about it

03:07:25.600 --> 03:07:29.560
but I figured this out as the years went by. The degree of difficulty that he must have

03:07:29.560 --> 03:07:35.040
experienced when he first came to Manhattan and started teaching, it must have just been

03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:36.040
incredible.

03:07:36.040 --> 03:07:42.240
You've got to remember Hanzo came from Brazil training with the best people in the world

03:07:42.240 --> 03:07:56.200
at that time, Hickson, all the Machados. All of them were located around Gracie Baja and

03:07:56.200 --> 03:08:02.480
that Rio de Janeiro set. They all knew each other and they all trained together. They

03:08:02.480 --> 03:08:08.200
had internal problems of course, but they all knew each other well and knew each other's

03:08:08.200 --> 03:08:15.400
names. All of them had beautiful and highly developed jiu-jitsu. All Hanzo knew from childhood

03:08:15.400 --> 03:08:22.880
on was perfect, beautiful jiu-jitsu and communicating with other people who also knew perfect, beautiful

03:08:22.880 --> 03:08:32.680
jiu-jitsu. Then he comes to New York where he has to teach in a language that he at that

03:08:33.240 --> 03:08:40.480
barely spoke to a bunch of fucking morons who didn't even, on my first day in jiu-jitsu

03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:44.120
they had to explain to me the difference between the mount and the guard because as far as

03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:49.360
I was concerned, yeah, you're on top. It's the same thing. They're like, no, no, no.

03:08:49.360 --> 03:08:52.960
Mounted is different from guard and I'm like, no, it's not. Like you're on top of the guy.

03:08:52.960 --> 03:08:53.960
You just hit him.

03:08:53.960 --> 03:08:57.360
So he has to argue with you about this.

03:08:57.360 --> 03:09:02.980
I'm going from training with Hickson Gracie to having to tell some moron that guard is

03:09:02.980 --> 03:09:11.120
different from mount. We were so primitive back then. He went from the best training

03:09:11.120 --> 03:09:17.080
culture in the world to literally the worst. Just a bunch of guys in their mid-twenties

03:09:17.080 --> 03:09:21.040
who knew nothing about the ground.

03:09:21.040 --> 03:09:29.520
Luckily, he's known for his patience. Out of that, he molded one of the greatest gyms

03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:32.040
ever in New York.

03:09:32.040 --> 03:09:39.160
He did a fantastic job. Most of it was based around the idea that he gave us complete freedom.

03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:46.960
We came in, we trained all day and I started teaching beginners classes. Then some of his

03:09:47.360 --> 03:09:53.360
senior students, Hikaru Ameda, Rodrigo Gracie, and Matt Serra opened their own schools around

03:09:53.360 --> 03:10:00.640
the Tri-State area. So they left. There was a vacuum of teachers and he asked me to start

03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:06.520
teaching. I taught for many, many years there and he always gave us complete freedom. His

03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:11.680
only thing was to say, okay, do whatever you want, just make sure it's effective. Prove

03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:16.920
to me it's effective. That's the best research program you can ever have. Show me

03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:25.680
proof. Especially in those days in jiu-jitsu, there were so many things that were just off

03:10:25.680 --> 03:10:30.880
limits. You couldn't study legos, you couldn't do this, you couldn't do that. This kind of

03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:35.760
game was for cowards. This is the only kind of game we accept. Hanzo was never like that.

03:10:35.760 --> 03:10:42.120
He was just like, okay, just do what you want, prove to me it works. If you give people that

03:10:42.120 --> 03:10:46.840
simple structure, you give them some time, some ingenuity, a lot of things can happen.

03:10:46.840 --> 03:10:52.560
I got to ask you, and by the way, he'll come on this podcast and I do feel like it's a little

03:10:52.560 --> 03:10:58.680
bit like riding a dragon or a bull of some kind. It'll be a fun journey. I can't, at least from my

03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:05.640
perspective, having interacted with him, having met him, it's hard not to smile. He's easily one

03:11:05.640 --> 03:11:11.120
of the most charismatic people in jiu-jitsu. It's kind of fun to watch that humans can be like this

03:11:11.120 --> 03:11:17.240
too. It's just the love that radiates from him is incredible. I got to ask you, this is from Reddit.

03:11:17.240 --> 03:11:23.080
There's a few legends that come from that gym, but people on Reddit kept asking me about some

03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:29.960
guy named Boris. Apparently you coached him at Hanzo's and he was a legend and he was terrifyingly

03:11:29.960 --> 03:11:35.920
good. What made him a legend? Who's this Boris character? Boris is one of my early students.

03:11:35.920 --> 03:11:40.400
I think he was either my first or second black belt. Boris came from Long Island. He was a

03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:49.760
wrestler. He was of Russian Jewish descent and highly intelligent. Now he was short of stature,

03:11:49.760 --> 03:12:02.560
but very powerfully built and compact. Very nice, polite young man, but also slightly eccentric,

03:12:02.880 --> 03:12:11.280
which I always liked about him. He would always come dressed with glasses on and he would leave

03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:21.040
the gym dressed like, to use the American phrase, a complete nerd with his pocket protector.

03:12:22.480 --> 03:12:27.600
He was heavily muscled, but he would dress in such a way that he didn't appear so when he left. We

03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:32.720
always used to laugh. Imagine some guy tried to mug Boris. They would see him with his nerdy

03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:38.640
glasses on and his pocket protector and they would literally run into one of the most formidable human

03:12:38.640 --> 03:12:43.920
beings in the entire New York area. Boris started training jiu-jitsu, I believe in Long Island,

03:12:43.920 --> 03:12:50.880
and then when he got a tech job in Manhattan, started training with us in a morning class.

03:12:51.280 --> 03:12:58.640
These were relatively early days in Manhattan and my teaching career. He and a group of others,

03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:06.400
a very small group, used to train early in the morning around 6 a.m. before work. Boris was a

03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:15.760
legend in those days. A very young George St. Pierre came to train with us at that time and he

03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:22.000
would come in at 6 a.m. to do his morning class. He was one of the main training partners for

03:13:23.440 --> 03:13:30.160
Boris. Boris being a wrestler, I used to generally prefer top position. I would always encourage

03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:34.080
George to play bottom position. I'd say, you've got to get good in bottom position. You never know.

03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:37.280
I know you're good at takedowns, but one day someone's going to put you down, so you've got

03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:43.520
to work bottom position. Boris had very strong guard passing. I remember one of George's happiest

03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:49.520
days is finally after two years, one day he swept Boris, got on top, and finished him.

03:13:50.400 --> 03:13:57.920
I remember that was one of his biggest thrills in all of his training career.

03:13:57.920 --> 03:13:59.840
That was the last time that ever happened.

03:14:01.200 --> 03:14:08.800
No, Boris was a very formal man for that time. The funny thing about Boris is every time we

03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:14.560
would have a conversation, he would say, I'm only going to do this sport until I'm 40 years old,

03:14:14.560 --> 03:14:20.960
and then I'm going to stop. I was like, why? Why not be like a lifelong martial artist? You

03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:25.600
got so good. You're good at jiu-jitsu. You've got great skills. You've worked hard. Why not just

03:14:26.160 --> 03:14:30.160
keep going? He's like, it's ridiculous for a man to train after 40. There's no need.

03:14:31.040 --> 03:14:33.760
You never gave any reason for this. It was just ridiculous.

03:14:34.480 --> 03:14:35.200
Oh, man.

03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:40.560
One day, now this is a guy who came in literally every day, 6 a.m., every day.

03:14:42.240 --> 03:14:45.680
One day, he comes in and he comes up to me at the end of training and he goes, hey, John,

03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:53.440
I just turned 40, so I won't be seeing you again. He's joking. I'm like, I'll see you tomorrow,

03:14:53.440 --> 03:14:57.360
Boris. He's like, no, you won't, and walks off. How gangster is that?

03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:01.680
And then he never came back. I've never seen Boris since. He came in, was one of the best

03:15:02.240 --> 03:15:08.080
crapers I ever saw, and just said, that's it, buddy, I'm out.

03:15:09.840 --> 03:15:10.960
No one to walk away.

03:15:12.800 --> 03:15:18.320
I also got to hang out, got to hang out with Ali Abdelaziz. He's a Hensel Gracie Blackbelt,

03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:23.440
fourth degree judo Blackbelt, and friend and manager of Khabib Nurmagomedov, who's

03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:31.600
coming down to Austin soon. We'll do a podcast. Hopefully, you'll get on the mat and have a bit

03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:37.680
of brainstorm. Also, he's a manager and friend of many other amazing fighters.

03:15:40.400 --> 03:15:48.320
I really love the guy. The loyalty, the fact that he looks for loyalty and has that inner,

03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:53.520
close inner circle and integrity and character and people, I really liked him. I connected

03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:58.240
really quickly. But any fun stories about Ali? Did you train together?

03:15:58.240 --> 03:16:01.840
Yes. He trained for many years in the basement of my classes.

03:16:06.560 --> 03:16:13.360
His story is one of the most unlikely stories. If someone wrote a movie plot about his life,

03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:17.680
they'd be like, this is absurd. He's thrown out the door in a second, and yet it all happened.

03:16:20.800 --> 03:16:27.520
You're absolutely correct. He has, from the unlikeliest possible starts, created a situation

03:16:27.520 --> 03:16:32.320
where he's, I think it's incontestable now to say he's the most successful manager in

03:16:32.320 --> 03:16:38.880
mixed martial arts history. He has more champions under his care than anyone else I'm aware of.

03:16:39.520 --> 03:16:44.160
And respected and influential, so on all dimensions, yes.

03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:47.840
Now, many people aren't aware of the fact that he was actually a very good judo player.

03:16:49.120 --> 03:16:50.160
Judoka first, yeah.

03:16:50.640 --> 03:16:58.240
He had very good Nogi judo. He had an excellent Haraigoshi, very good Taniyatoshi,

03:16:59.600 --> 03:17:05.920
and he threw many people who were highly credentialed wrestlers back in the basement,

03:17:05.920 --> 03:17:12.320
back in the glory days of MMA training. He was a good example of a guy who had very,

03:17:12.320 --> 03:17:22.160
very good judo hips and often used it to counter wrestling and was a fine demonstrator of the idea

03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:30.320
that when judo is adapted to Nogi gripping, it can provide a very effective foil to many of the

03:17:30.320 --> 03:17:36.000
standard forms of wrestling attack. And he would often use Uchimata to counter leg tackles and do

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:40.800
so in a very, very spectacular fashion. Well, what do you think about Khabib?

03:17:42.240 --> 03:17:46.720
Is there something from just watching him or is there something you can imagine

03:17:47.360 --> 03:17:51.520
if he comes down to the gym that you might learn from the way he moves,

03:17:51.520 --> 03:17:54.160
the way he approaches wrestling? Oh, absolutely. He's one of the

03:17:54.160 --> 03:17:57.520
greatest combat athletes of all time. If you can't learn from someone like that,

03:17:57.520 --> 03:18:00.400
there's something wrong with you. So he emphasizes control.

03:18:01.040 --> 03:18:07.840
Yes, he does. And he's absolutely a master of exerting control. The amount of

03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:14.400
grappling control he was able to put over some of the most difficult people in the world to control

03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:19.520
was truly astounding. He beat people from every style. He beat wrestlers, he beat jiu-jitsu

03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:26.000
players, he beat kickboxes, and he controlled them all in more or less the same way. He has a very

03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:31.520
underrated bottom game. People think, oh, he's just about stifling top control. But people forget he

03:18:31.520 --> 03:18:36.560
was taken down on several occasions and ended up in bottom position. And he showed excellent

03:18:36.560 --> 03:18:42.240
guard work from bottom. He was able to get into submission holds readily on opponents from bottom

03:18:42.240 --> 03:18:48.880
position. He's got an excellent bottom game. People say, oh, he's just a positional guy. No,

03:18:48.880 --> 03:18:53.200
he's not. He's got great submissions. The application of his triangle from both top

03:18:53.200 --> 03:18:59.280
and bottom was top class. He had a sharp armlock from bottom position. Excellent kimura. If you

03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:06.320
look at his kimura finishes in MMA, they were technically very, very well set. Excellent

03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:14.880
breaking mechanics. He's a very, very fine grappler in both submission grappling and MMA grappling.

03:19:14.880 --> 03:19:18.560
I think we'd probably learn a ton from moving around with him.

03:19:18.560 --> 03:19:26.320
Is it possible to learn something about him or about Hodger Gracie or about Gordon by

03:19:27.920 --> 03:19:35.200
watching them or rolling around them for a little bit? Maybe Hodger and Khabib are good examples

03:19:36.560 --> 03:19:44.640
because they're able to do seemingly very basic things on everybody and dominate them with that.

03:19:44.720 --> 03:19:50.080
I think Gordon is as well, but Gordon seems to have more preference and range of what he's

03:19:50.080 --> 03:19:59.440
able to do. It's almost miraculous how much Hodger can do by just the same exact thing

03:19:59.440 --> 03:20:07.520
on everybody. Is it possible to understand why Hodger and Khabib are so good at very basic

03:20:07.520 --> 03:20:13.600
positions? Or do you have to feel it? Or is it just something that's developed over

03:20:15.120 --> 03:20:19.280
years and years? I think for most people, for the vast majority of people,

03:20:19.280 --> 03:20:25.360
it would have to be explained to them. For a smaller group of people, if they felt it,

03:20:25.360 --> 03:20:29.920
they could try to replicate it. There are a few people who could look at it and have enough

03:20:29.920 --> 03:20:35.600
knowledge and say, okay, I can see what he's doing. For example, Hodger could probably look at

03:20:36.320 --> 03:20:39.840
video footage of Khabib grappling and say, okay, I understand what he's doing.

03:20:40.320 --> 03:20:44.720
But the average person would probably go over the hits.

03:20:44.720 --> 03:20:52.720
You sometimes think of these great athletes. Maybe they're too narrow. You might imagine

03:20:52.720 --> 03:20:58.480
they're so focused on a particular thing, they don't develop in interesting ways. He's just a

03:20:58.480 --> 03:21:08.320
sweetheart. He's a wonderful person to be around. He's also visiting Austin. First of all, I'm

03:21:08.320 --> 03:21:15.120
honored just drinking a little bit too much in Vegas with Hodger Gracie and talking about

03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:24.000
love and relationships and life and death and all those philosophical topics as one does in Vegas

03:21:24.720 --> 03:21:30.960
and a little bit too much to drink. Anyway, after ADCC, it was beautiful. On top of that,

03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:37.440
hanging out with Rogan many days for UFC and then ADCC. One thing, I don't know if you've

03:21:37.440 --> 03:21:44.880
gotten a chance to hang out with Joe when he plays pool. I spent a lot of time with him when

03:21:44.880 --> 03:21:51.040
he was playing pool recently on that trip to Vegas. There's something Zen-like about,

03:21:51.760 --> 03:21:59.760
first of all, just watching him. But I've never seen the focus the guy's got on the game for hours.

03:22:00.720 --> 03:22:08.640
Just deep focus, unshakable focus. That was so interesting to watch that this human being,

03:22:08.640 --> 03:22:17.120
he's a celebrity. He does all kinds of stuff that he's able to allocate as close to 100% of his

03:22:17.120 --> 03:22:23.040
mind as I can imagine to a particular task and nothing can distract him. That was really

03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:29.440
inspiring that you could still do that on any task. Pool is a game of physics.

03:22:29.440 --> 03:22:34.000
That should be your domain. It is, but that wasn't just physics. I would think

03:22:34.800 --> 03:22:40.560
you understand the game. You understand the physics of it. You also understand the fun of it

03:22:40.560 --> 03:22:46.000
because there's friends and laughter and so on. I would be distracted by that a little bit.

03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:54.480
I wouldn't be as focused. The closer you get to the table, the more everything zooms in.

03:22:54.480 --> 03:22:59.200
The jokes, there's funny things. You can't get his attention on anything. It's that focus.

03:22:59.200 --> 03:23:09.920
I don't know. That really stuck with me. Those memes like, I want to find somebody that looks

03:23:09.920 --> 03:23:14.800
at me the way X looks at Y. I want to find somebody that looks at me the way Joe looks

03:23:14.800 --> 03:23:19.280
at a pool cue or whatever. The focus there. I want to find something in my life.

03:23:21.440 --> 03:23:28.720
Rather, I want to attain the level of focus he has for pool on a task that I care about.

03:23:30.240 --> 03:23:37.600
That focus like, fuck everything else. Now it's time to do work. I don't know. That was

03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:44.160
really inspiring. I haven't seen that kind of focus for prolonged periods of time on a task.

03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:51.280
You should see some time. Part of it is just being competitive with himself.

03:23:51.280 --> 03:23:56.560
It's the hatred of imperfection, all those kinds of elements, but embodied in a singular focus.

03:23:57.200 --> 03:23:59.600
I had no idea he even played pool. It's interesting.

03:24:00.480 --> 03:24:05.360
We should watch him. He won't. I think it could be one of his greatest obsessions.

03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:17.120
I thought pool is for degenerates, gamblers, and hustlers. The same way I see poker,

03:24:17.920 --> 03:24:26.640
but I saw a wolf slash elite athlete in Joe. I said, I didn't know this. I don't know much

03:24:26.640 --> 03:24:31.600
about pool. I didn't know that you could have that level of focus while still drunk at your ass,

03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:39.760
but extremely focused. It was beautiful to see. I don't know, inspiring for me as a person who

03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:46.240
highly values singular focus on a task. Let me ask you from a perspective of a hobbyist,

03:24:46.240 --> 03:24:53.760
what major practical changes can a hobbyist who works regular nine to five job do to improve

03:24:53.760 --> 03:24:58.960
their jiu-jitsu? They're in a gym. There's a lot of excellent gyms throughout the United States.

03:24:58.960 --> 03:25:04.640
What can they do to improve their jiu-jitsu? About the way they think about jiu-jitsu,

03:25:04.640 --> 03:25:07.840
about the way they approach their actual schedule, those kinds of things.

03:25:07.840 --> 03:25:16.080
That's a great question. The less training time you've got, the more you want to maximize its

03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:24.480
effect. A question becomes, if I'm training, say, twice a week, and sometimes even once a week,

03:25:25.040 --> 03:25:30.480
what can I do to make sure that that two-hour period is used maximally?

03:25:34.400 --> 03:25:40.240
The less training time you've got, the more the onus is on you to have a plan before you walk in

03:25:40.240 --> 03:25:47.680
the door. If you go in to saying, I'm going to roll around and see what happens, or I'll just

03:25:47.680 --> 03:25:52.400
follow what the instructor says, you'll get a certain amount out of each class,

03:25:52.400 --> 03:25:59.520
but it will never be what it could have been. Go in with a plan and then act it. Many people

03:25:59.520 --> 03:26:05.120
go in with a plan and don't follow it. Let's say, for example,

03:26:09.120 --> 03:26:16.560
we start with a program that goes like this. First, try to create the most honest assessment

03:26:16.560 --> 03:26:24.720
honest assessment of yourself as a jiu-jitsu player. It's tough to make an honest assessment

03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:32.000
of yourself because you never actually get to see your game. What I would recommend is to start

03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:40.800
by videotaping yourself, inspiring with your peers. That's fascinating because we don't even

03:26:40.800 --> 03:26:47.200
have that level of introspection ability to reflect of what we actually look like in grappling.

03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:51.760
Start with an assessment of yourself. The most honest one comes not from you, it comes from the

03:26:51.760 --> 03:27:02.880
camera. Have a look at what you see and start to say, okay, many of the weaknesses in your game

03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:07.920
are made much more apparent by looking from the outside in rather than feeling them during the

03:27:07.920 --> 03:27:17.440
heat of a match. Identify four or five of the biggest weaknesses that you see and start actively

03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:24.880
attacking those weaknesses. Ask yourself, let's say, for example, in the course of watching the

03:27:24.880 --> 03:27:30.800
videotaping of yourself, you observe yourself losing three triangles. You attempted three

03:27:30.800 --> 03:27:39.520
triangle strangleholds, you failed all three. You could start by saying, okay, let me ask myself,

03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:47.120
who are the people I look up to the most with regards to a triangle strangle? Who are the

03:27:47.680 --> 03:27:51.760
guys who have the best triangle strangles out there? Then ask yourselves,

03:27:53.600 --> 03:27:58.960
of those people, who are the ones whose body type and personality most closely mirrors my own?

03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:07.200
And that would be a good example of taking a problem in your game, contrasting it with

03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:12.880
elite level performance in people whose body type roughly matches your own, and then try to

03:28:13.840 --> 03:28:18.640
take lessons you learn by observing the best people and bringing them into your own game

03:28:18.640 --> 03:28:24.800
in one specific area. As time goes by, you do this with more and more elements of your game,

03:28:24.800 --> 03:28:32.400
you will undoubtedly improve. You will also have to make sure that you take time during class

03:28:32.400 --> 03:28:37.760
to actively work on these things. Now, sometimes in class, you don't get a choice. The instructor

03:28:37.760 --> 03:28:42.720
sometimes says, okay, today we're working this, this, and this, but there's always time after

03:28:42.720 --> 03:28:47.280
and before class where you can do your own drilling, where you can make your own inquiries.

03:28:47.280 --> 03:28:54.080
And during sparring, there's no rigorous control over what you do. You can try to work the game

03:28:54.080 --> 03:28:59.840
into the area of focus. So for example, if you want to work on front triangles, it would be wise

03:28:59.840 --> 03:29:04.640
for you to do most of your sparring from bottom guard positions. That will give you the most

03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:14.960
opportunity. And in this sense, it always begins with an accurate assessment of your current skill

03:29:14.960 --> 03:29:21.520
level. You've got to start there. Then I always encourage people to use video camera to make the

03:29:21.520 --> 03:29:31.360
most honest appraisal you can because your own mind is not dishonest, but it's understandably

03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:37.760
inaccurate. You tend to feel things rather than see them when you're performing jiu-jitsu. Then

03:29:37.760 --> 03:29:48.160
make a program for yourself based around what you see as excellence. Look at the people in the sport

03:29:48.160 --> 03:29:53.520
who's in the area you want to work on, people who are renowned for skill in that area.

03:29:54.800 --> 03:30:00.080
If possible, narrow it down to people who have excellence in that area and their body type

03:30:00.640 --> 03:30:06.720
corresponds with your own. And then try to take lessons learned from observing the excellence

03:30:06.720 --> 03:30:12.560
in these elite athletes and bring elements of them into your game. Never try to bring

03:30:13.200 --> 03:30:19.680
an elite athlete's entire game to your game. That will create an inauthentic game on your part,

03:30:19.680 --> 03:30:22.800
which will always be a poor copy of what you're trying to watch.

03:30:23.360 --> 03:30:30.720
Rather bring very specific areas and skills that you see and import them from different people

03:30:30.720 --> 03:30:38.320
until eventually you find something for yourself. Experiment a lot, okay? Everyone's different.

03:30:38.320 --> 03:30:46.880
And so you will don't see the video research as the final word. See video research the way

03:30:46.880 --> 03:30:55.840
a writer will see a muse. As someone who initiates discussion, opens inquiries for your own research.

03:30:58.480 --> 03:31:03.920
The most powerful moments you will have on the mat come from making discoveries for yourself.

03:31:04.480 --> 03:31:10.000
Not being told what to do, not observing someone else doing something, but self discoveries.

03:31:11.760 --> 03:31:19.680
Those are the ones that will last inside you. So use video research not as the definitive answer

03:31:19.680 --> 03:31:26.400
to your problems, but as initiating research for yourself on the mat. And as time goes by

03:31:26.400 --> 03:31:30.480
and you do this more and more often in more and more areas of the sport, I promise you,

03:31:30.480 --> 03:31:34.720
you'll improve. Yeah. And I guess when you have the plan,

03:31:35.280 --> 03:31:41.280
have a plan that carries across many training sessions. So I just remember, I know this is

03:31:42.240 --> 03:31:50.880
perhaps dumb, but I saw in my own game early on a lot of growth by self-identifying a problem

03:31:51.760 --> 03:31:58.640
and coming up by myself with a solution by watching, in that case, Marcel Garcia. I just

03:31:58.720 --> 03:32:06.080
thought my butterfly guard was very weak. And so I thought, okay, what's the solution here? I thought

03:32:06.080 --> 03:32:11.840
maybe this X guard thing, double X guard. Okay. So I watched a bunch of video, let me try to work

03:32:11.840 --> 03:32:20.320
on this. And then all I did, just this self, but when I could get time by myself, meaning like not

03:32:20.320 --> 03:32:26.880
instructor guided classes, but in training, I would just, every, everything I would put myself

03:32:26.880 --> 03:32:33.760
into butterfly and X guard and then just let go, like don't progress, sweep and figure out a way

03:32:33.760 --> 03:32:38.320
to get swept to get right back to it, back to it and everything. It was annoying probably to train

03:32:38.320 --> 03:32:42.400
with me because that's all I did. And it's all I thought about. Right. But you learned quickly.

03:32:42.400 --> 03:32:48.320
Yeah. I learned it's the most progress I've ever made. Now you could say that X guard wasn't the

03:32:48.320 --> 03:32:55.120
right solution for me, that maybe that wasn't the weakest point for me to work on. If I were to look

03:32:55.120 --> 03:33:02.560
back now, it's still to this day, sadly, the week, the obvious weakest point for me is escapes from

03:33:02.560 --> 03:33:07.360
much worse positions that that should be worked on. That should have been worked on from the very

03:33:07.360 --> 03:33:11.600
beginning. That's still today. If I were to say, what's the weakest thing that I should work on?

03:33:11.600 --> 03:33:20.480
Absolutely is even, even with one day a week is escapes. But yeah, a lot of that has to do with

03:33:20.480 --> 03:33:26.960
just carrying, like focusing on the one thing over and over and over and over across training

03:33:26.960 --> 03:33:33.200
sessions. Now it also, I would write down on a sheet of paper the number of times I would

03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:41.680
get an X guard sweep. And I would set a rule that I have to get whatever it was, like 500 sweeps a

03:33:41.680 --> 03:33:47.120
week. So I have to, and then like the closer you get to the end of the week, the more you like just

03:33:47.120 --> 03:33:51.920
pick up a small white belt. 500 in a week? Yes. Your training partners must suck, bro.

03:33:53.120 --> 03:33:59.600
No, you start with good ones, and then you get more and more desperate. You start like finding

03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:06.560
the kid, right? You can just sweep over and over. But like that number for me, the numbers for some

03:34:06.560 --> 03:34:15.360
reason, it set a goal to pull off a technique. It enforced, like we're staying with this for a while.

03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:22.000
This is a journey we're doing. And then for some reason for me, that helped me focus the study to

03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:27.600
understand the deep complexities of this thing. That at least for me, other people, like nobody

03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:31.840
at the gym was doing X guard or anything of that. So you have to kind of figure everything out

03:34:31.840 --> 03:34:38.560
yourself. I'm sure there's better ways to do that, but at least that focus helps from a hobbyist

03:34:38.560 --> 03:34:46.160
perspective. What's the perfect day in the life of John Donahue? If we're talking about a basic

03:34:46.160 --> 03:34:56.480
non-ADCC. Now, I'm really grateful that you sit down with me on a Sunday late at night,

03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:05.520
but it all starts again for you tomorrow. So three training sessions a day. What time do you wake up?

03:35:06.480 --> 03:35:08.080
Do you do like a mantra in the morning?

03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:17.200
Do you listen to like some Zen music? What do you eat in the morning? What's the perfect day look

03:35:17.200 --> 03:35:30.560
like? When you sacrifice a small animal to the gods? I usually, when you say a perfect day,

03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:34.880
what I think you really mean is an average day. Perfectly productive average day.

03:35:35.840 --> 03:35:42.960
So let's take Monday morning. For you watching this video, we're filming this late on a Sunday

03:35:42.960 --> 03:35:52.880
night. So after this, I'll drive home. We just had ADCC. It was two weeks ago. It was one of

03:35:52.880 --> 03:35:58.640
the longest training camps. It was the longest training camp I've ever run because of the fact

03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:01.440
we had to go through three different matches for Gordon Ryan leading up to it.

03:36:02.160 --> 03:36:09.760
So immediately after ADCC, I cut the training down for the competitive athletes to

03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:15.360
one session per day for the first week after ADCC to give their bodies a bit of a break.

03:36:16.320 --> 03:36:23.040
I still have to teach two classes in addition to that, two recreational classes. So my teaching

03:36:23.040 --> 03:36:31.760
schedule went down to three classes per day. After one week of relative break, we go back to

03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:38.480
two competition classes per day, plus two recreational classes, plus an MMA class for

03:36:39.280 --> 03:36:48.720
Gary Tonan and his friends. The first class requires me to get up around 6 a.m.

03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:56.720
to drive. I'm still a student driver, so I'm not very good at driving. So I have to spend

03:36:56.720 --> 03:37:02.160
a little extra time to get to the destination on time. Just for the record, John pulled in

03:37:02.160 --> 03:37:08.240
in a red Lamborghini with a... No. You're the worst liar I've ever met.

03:37:09.760 --> 03:37:15.440
My day typically starts pretty early. I don't eat in the morning. I just get up and go to work.

03:37:16.080 --> 03:37:23.920
And I teach through the day. My last class finishes usually around 8 p.m. During that time,

03:37:25.200 --> 03:37:33.600
I coach jiu-jitsu. I try to find time for one Instagram post per day, which

03:37:33.600 --> 03:37:40.240
usually describes some basic theme of jiu-jitsu in most cases, unless we've just had a competition,

03:37:40.240 --> 03:37:44.480
in which case I'll talk about upcoming competitions or what happens after a competition.

03:37:44.480 --> 03:37:51.920
But most of them just express a simple jiu-jitsu theme. I try to do a short workout for myself,

03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:59.920
and then I go home. At the end of the day, I always start by asking myself,

03:37:59.920 --> 03:38:04.160
what do my students need from me tomorrow? Based on what I've seen today, what do the

03:38:04.160 --> 03:38:08.640
recreational students need, and what do the competitive students need? This is always

03:38:09.200 --> 03:38:14.480
done in the light of what are the upcoming competitions.

03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:21.600
But throughout the day, you're doing a lot of really in-depth classes. So how do you either

03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:28.240
prepare for them or think through them as they're happening? Think through the material that you're

03:38:28.240 --> 03:38:32.960
teaching. I can look at a class. I've been doing this a long time, so I can just look at a class

03:38:32.960 --> 03:38:36.800
and be like, okay, these guys need this, this, and this. And then I make reflections at the

03:38:36.800 --> 03:38:42.480
end of the day. Then I'll take care of things that we all do, talk to family,

03:38:43.040 --> 03:38:49.520
occasionally go out for dinner with friends, dates, things like that.

03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:55.920
Yeah, Hensel had to really harass you to drag you out and to hang out, and he was very convincing.

03:38:56.800 --> 03:38:58.160
And food-wise?

03:38:58.160 --> 03:38:58.960
I eat once a day.

03:39:00.000 --> 03:39:05.520
At the end of the day, I usually stop off at a place like a supermarket, like Whole Foods or some

03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:08.240
equivalent to that, and buy something simple and eat.

03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:16.560
The internet wants to know the details. Did you end up getting Wi-Fi for your apartment?

03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:19.120
No, I'm still thinking about it.

03:39:21.120 --> 03:39:22.320
What are the pros and cons?

03:39:23.200 --> 03:39:30.800
There's no cons, lots of pros, but I just don't put much importance to it. Things that are

03:39:30.800 --> 03:39:32.160
unimportant, I just ignore.

03:39:32.160 --> 03:39:35.360
Yeah, there's a lot of things in life that have a lot of pros, but they're lower in

03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:39.200
the priority list. Why? Because the 5G already-

03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:40.320
5G's got it covered.

03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:45.120
Do you watch much video? Do you watch footage?

03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:50.720
Video footage, quite often, yeah. Especially things from freestyle wrestling,

03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:56.560
Greco-Roman wrestling, judo, and mixed martial arts. Also,

03:39:57.920 --> 03:40:03.440
subsidiary sports to mixed martial arts like boxing, Muay Thai, and European kickboxing.

03:40:03.520 --> 03:40:05.760
Just for long-term idea generation?

03:40:05.760 --> 03:40:06.260
Yes.

03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:09.360
Like a plant, a seed, an idea?

03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:11.920
Yeah, this is an interesting thing. How could this be incorporated in the

03:40:11.920 --> 03:40:14.240
context in which we use it, MMA or jiu-jitsu?

03:40:15.840 --> 03:40:21.520
Maybe it's immediately obvious, or it might become obvious in a few weeks or months.

03:40:23.040 --> 03:40:28.000
Is there some aspect to the way you approach life and training and martial arts

03:40:28.800 --> 03:40:33.520
that amends itself to minimalism? It seems like you live a pretty stoic life,

03:40:34.320 --> 03:40:37.600
or is that just a symptom of unfocused existence?

03:40:37.600 --> 03:40:41.520
My life wasn't always like this. I've gone through different phases in my life. I was

03:40:41.520 --> 03:40:48.000
a university student and teacher at university. I was a nightclub bouncer for more than a decade.

03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:53.920
I've been through different areas of life. I've seen most things. I've experienced a lot.

03:40:53.920 --> 03:41:00.240
I've traveled the world. At this point in my life, people think I live some kind of monk-like

03:41:00.240 --> 03:41:08.240
existence, but I have a private life. I like to go out and have fun like everyone else.

03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:15.120
I'm not like some kind of monk who just sits under a waterfall and meditates

03:41:15.120 --> 03:41:16.240
or anything crazy like that.

03:41:16.240 --> 03:41:21.120
Well, that's why. I'm currently going through that stage in my life, the monk-like existence.

03:41:21.920 --> 03:41:28.880
I would be amiss not to ask you one of the most important questions one can possibly ask John

03:41:28.880 --> 03:41:35.760
Donoher, which is on the topic of animal combat. Who wins in a fight to the death,

03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:41.440
or maybe in a sport competition setting, but let's go with the fight to the death.

03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:49.680
A grizzly bear, a silverback gorilla, and maybe a lion or a tiger, an African lion,

03:41:50.320 --> 03:41:55.840
or one of the flavors of tiger. I don't know who you think is more ferocious.

03:41:55.840 --> 03:42:00.400
What are the parameters to consider here? Maybe I can throw a few out and maybe you can give me

03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:06.480
some thoughts about how much of these parameters matter. First of all, intelligence.

03:42:08.240 --> 03:42:14.880
I do believe the gorilla is the most intelligent. I did research for this, as you can imagine.

03:42:14.880 --> 03:42:19.680
Gorilla or with Joe Rogan?

03:42:21.680 --> 03:42:28.000
The expert advisor to this very podcast and this very topic is indeed Joe Rogan, yes.

03:42:29.360 --> 03:42:35.760
In captivity, gorillas have been documented to show complex emotions, form family bonds,

03:42:35.760 --> 03:42:42.320
the ability to use tools, and to be able to reason about the past and the future.

03:42:42.880 --> 03:42:43.680
That's impressive.

03:42:44.160 --> 03:42:48.560
That's something that, at least in captivity, the other animals have not been able to do.

03:42:48.560 --> 03:42:50.400
They're already so much more advanced than I am.

03:42:54.560 --> 03:43:02.400
Yeah, so that's intelligence. Then there is weight. I think that's something that you think of at

03:43:02.400 --> 03:43:09.280
first. The lion, let's go with the big ones. I took notes here, 550 pounds for big lion.

03:43:09.280 --> 03:43:14.720
That's exceptionally large. Most male lions are around 450 pounds. That's an exceptional beast then.

03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:20.480
Thank you. The tiger can be larger than that.

03:43:20.480 --> 03:43:21.680
Yeah, much larger.

03:43:22.640 --> 03:43:25.680
So we've got the grizzly bear, which is probably the biggest of the bunch.

03:43:26.800 --> 03:43:31.280
The large ones get to 1,500 pounds. Correct me if some of this is the number.

03:43:31.280 --> 03:43:36.400
I believe most grizzlies are around a thousand pound mark. It's a big, big beast.

03:43:36.400 --> 03:43:39.760
I was looking up the biggest, but I didn't want to do the biggest ever,

03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:45.040
just the top of the range, because there's always a range.

03:43:45.040 --> 03:43:48.800
You can put it in at roughly double that of even a very big lion.

03:43:49.600 --> 03:43:54.960
Of course, how that weight is used is very important. There's also things which I find

03:43:54.960 --> 03:44:01.200
as interesting as anaconda. Let me throw that in there, because it's 200 pounds. What I really

03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:07.280
like about that is it's not just the weight, it's the form factor. I think out of all of these,

03:44:07.280 --> 03:44:11.040
the anaconda is the most non-standard form factor.

03:44:11.920 --> 03:44:18.000
I totally agree with that. It's like the knight on the chessboard. It comes in from a completely

03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:26.880
different angle. We got that. We got also strength, which could be measured in ability to carry stuff.

03:44:27.680 --> 03:44:34.080
This was surprising to me. I did look into this carefully. The grizzly bear at 1,000 or 1,500

03:44:34.080 --> 03:44:41.760
pounds can only carry at most its body weight, which is a lot, but a gorilla can carry 10 times

03:44:41.760 --> 03:44:47.840
its body weight. A gorilla can lift over 2,000 kilograms, so that's over 4,000 pounds.

03:44:48.800 --> 03:44:52.720
Gorillas themselves and adult male weighs in around 350 to 400?

03:44:52.720 --> 03:44:57.760
400 pounds, yes. I like how in this particular place where I found this,

03:44:58.720 --> 03:45:05.600
2,000 kilograms is as heavy as 30 average humans, so a gorilla can carry 30 humans.

03:45:05.600 --> 03:45:11.680
That's carrying strength. Then of course, bite force, because that's one of the weapons

03:45:11.680 --> 03:45:18.080
in question here. Now, this is really surprising to me. The gorilla has won me over through this,

03:45:18.080 --> 03:45:24.240
by the way. I'm a sucker for intelligence, but the gorilla bite force is the highest of all these

03:45:24.240 --> 03:45:33.520
with 1,300 psi. Bear is second with 1,200 psi. Tiger is third. I think tiger and lion is third

03:45:33.520 --> 03:45:40.960
with 1,000 psi. That's comparable. A bear is anywhere from 900 to 1,000 psi. They're close,

03:45:40.960 --> 03:45:46.000
but gorilla, I would not have expected. Now, gorilla is not a carnivore, but apparently,

03:45:46.960 --> 03:45:54.800
it mostly eats grassy stuff. It's difficult to explain why it has such a powerful bite,

03:45:54.800 --> 03:45:58.800
and it also, of course, has very large in size of teeth as well as chewing teeth.

03:46:00.320 --> 03:46:07.680
Also, no neck. It's neck begins at the top of its head and just goes down to the shoulders.

03:46:07.680 --> 03:46:14.400
A lot of the way they use their teeth, all of these animals, the ultimate kill is to go for

03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:21.600
the bite on the neck. I don't know exactly why that probably has to do. Why is that? Because

03:46:21.600 --> 03:46:26.880
it's a very strong, controlled position, not just that it's a... Is it the same as Jujitsu,

03:46:26.880 --> 03:46:31.120
you think? Because they get to also choke them out? It's very much in line with Jujitsu. Lions

03:46:31.120 --> 03:46:35.840
are famous for using strangulation as their primary method of killing. They get a hold of the neck and

03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:44.720
hold it until the animal drops. Plus claws, I believe the tiger and the bear use their claws.

03:46:44.720 --> 03:46:52.160
And the lion too. The lion, right, and the lion. This is something that the gorilla doesn't do,

03:46:53.360 --> 03:46:59.120
and a condo, obviously, doesn't use a different approach. What do you think? How do we think

03:46:59.120 --> 03:47:05.120
about this? Also, there is... I'm just not letting you talk, apparently. There's levels of aggression

03:47:05.760 --> 03:47:12.400
in terms of... These are also very important considerations. All the considerations you've

03:47:12.400 --> 03:47:16.880
raised are very important, and we would have to address them if we're going to go through this

03:47:16.880 --> 03:47:24.640
topic. First things first, whenever you go into a discussion of this kind, there's

03:47:26.800 --> 03:47:32.240
a kind of natural impression that we all have as to which one would be the most formidable.

03:47:35.680 --> 03:47:41.920
It's important that you become rather skeptical of your first intuitions because they're often

03:47:41.920 --> 03:47:48.400
very misleading. Just as every boy thinks his father is the strongest man in the world,

03:47:49.120 --> 03:47:54.240
and then when he grows up into adulthood, he realizes his father was not even close to being

03:47:54.240 --> 03:48:00.000
the strongest man in the world. It's not because of anything other than inexperience. To a boy,

03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:03.040
his father seems overwhelmingly strong. He literally can't even imagine

03:48:04.240 --> 03:48:09.920
anyone else being stronger than that, so naively, he thinks his father is the strongest man in the

03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:17.680
world. So, too, in our relationship with animals, when we look at a silverback gorilla, it just looks

03:48:18.240 --> 03:48:26.240
overwhelmingly strong to us, to a degree, which is almost absurd. You picture the greatest combat

03:48:26.240 --> 03:48:32.160
athletes that humanity has ever produced. Prime Mike Tyson, Gordon Ryan for grappling.

03:48:32.960 --> 03:48:38.480
They would literally be torn limb from limb by an angry gorilla. It wouldn't even be remotely

03:48:38.480 --> 03:48:43.360
competitive. So, there's a sense in which we look at them in awe because of what they could do to

03:48:43.360 --> 03:48:52.080
us, but that can be very misleading. Just as a boy looks at his father as the pinnacle of strength,

03:48:52.800 --> 03:48:57.200
you can't necessarily, from a position of inexperience and weakness, look at a given

03:48:57.200 --> 03:49:01.440
animal and say, oh, that must be the toughest animal in the animal kingdom. There's levels

03:49:01.440 --> 03:49:09.040
to this game, and I think we can point out that the gorilla ultimately would be pretty low on

03:49:09.040 --> 03:49:12.960
those levels despite the fearsome appearance. I have some pushback to this analysis,

03:49:13.520 --> 03:49:19.120
because the data, we don't have much data on this. We actually have slightly more than you think,

03:49:19.120 --> 03:49:24.560
I believe. Oh, boy. Well, it's anecdotal. I feel like it's out of context. So, these species don't

03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:30.960
use, this is not MMA. They don't do interspecies fighting often. Yeah, but there are some ways of

03:49:30.960 --> 03:49:35.520
looking at this, which can take this already interesting question and make it a lot more

03:49:35.520 --> 03:49:43.840
interesting. First, we've seen that intuitions aren't to be trusted. So, if intuitions aren't

03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:48.880
to be trusted, well, what is to be trusted here? Well, I've always believed that there are three

03:49:50.800 --> 03:49:59.440
general elements that determine what level of success or failure anyone will experience

03:49:59.440 --> 03:50:05.520
in combat. And this is true both for individuals and for groups and even all the way up to nations.

03:50:06.240 --> 03:50:15.840
The first is what are your skills? The second is what are your physical and mental attributes? So,

03:50:15.840 --> 03:50:21.840
it's skills, attributes. Those are the two primary ones. And there is a third, which is your

03:50:21.840 --> 03:50:30.720
experience in using those skills and attributes in real world scenarios. So, we'll start with two

03:50:30.800 --> 03:50:36.800
humans. When two humans get into a fight, ask yourself, what is their skill set? What are their

03:50:36.800 --> 03:50:43.280
physical and mental attributes? And what is their experience in using those in real world applications?

03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:49.920
And that will give you your first look at, okay, who's going to be the more successful?

03:50:52.000 --> 03:50:58.240
Then, in addition to those three general elements, there's also four more specific elements.

03:51:01.520 --> 03:51:10.240
What is the ability of the combatants to initiate combat? Because initiation is a big deal in fighting.

03:51:10.240 --> 03:51:19.920
The one who sees the enemy first and can create ambush conditions or initiate combat in an area

03:51:19.920 --> 03:51:25.840
or a terrain which is favorable to them, this is huge in determining the outcome of battles.

03:51:26.240 --> 03:51:31.840
Second, not only is initiation important, but disengagement is important. A lot of battles

03:51:31.840 --> 03:51:37.600
don't go according to plan. And so, your ability to disengage at will and break off and away from

03:51:37.600 --> 03:51:46.800
a battle is key to success. So, initiation and disengagement are big. The third big element,

03:51:47.600 --> 03:51:54.480
what is your ability to end a fight? Okay, do you have an efficient method of ending conflict?

03:51:54.480 --> 03:52:01.760
Without that, the conflict could go on to a point where you no longer have the ability to

03:52:03.600 --> 03:52:10.800
continue it. If you have some succinct method of finishing, this is huge in combat in determining

03:52:10.800 --> 03:52:14.800
winner or loser. So, both from a winning and a losing position? Yes, but if you don't have one,

03:52:14.800 --> 03:52:19.120
there's a much higher chance you'll lose. But if you have an ability to finish an opponent,

03:52:19.120 --> 03:52:26.000
end the conflict reliably, this is very, very important in determining success or failure.

03:52:26.800 --> 03:52:35.200
And third is your ability to endure a conflict longer than the person you're engaged with. And

03:52:35.200 --> 03:52:41.200
so, you get these four more specific elements now. Do you have the ability to initiate contact at

03:52:41.200 --> 03:52:48.160
will? Do you have the ability to break contact and disengage at will? Do you have the ability

03:52:48.160 --> 03:52:53.360
to finish your opponent efficiently? And do you have the ability to endure longer than your

03:52:53.360 --> 03:53:00.400
opponent does? If you have all four of those, that's huge for combat. That probably applies

03:53:00.400 --> 03:53:08.640
to human-on-human military conflict. Everything, even all the way up to nations. Also, ask yourself,

03:53:09.600 --> 03:53:21.920
what are the most efficient methods of combat across the globe, across all species, all times,

03:53:21.920 --> 03:53:30.640
et cetera, et cetera? And you'll see that ultimately, they always come down to three things.

03:53:30.640 --> 03:53:40.400
The first is concentration of force. One of the most successful combat strategies of all time is

03:53:40.400 --> 03:53:46.800
the ability to take concentrated force against a zone of weakness in your opponent. And if you can

03:53:46.800 --> 03:53:52.640
do this, you will often break through to a point of vulnerability, attack that vulnerability in a

03:53:52.640 --> 03:53:57.440
way where your opponent cannot respond and cannot recover from that vulnerable point being broken.

03:53:57.440 --> 03:54:00.000
Do a high amount of damage with precision.

03:54:00.640 --> 03:54:06.640
So this is one of the great combat strategies across the animal kingdom, across human history,

03:54:06.640 --> 03:54:17.600
et cetera. The second would be ambush tactics. If you can ambush an opponent with the element of

03:54:17.600 --> 03:54:25.280
surprise, this is huge for success in combat. Almost all of the truly successful predators

03:54:25.280 --> 03:54:30.640
on this planet are ambush predators. The ability to get off to a good start

03:54:31.920 --> 03:54:35.520
in a way where opponents simply can't recover is huge for combat.

03:54:35.520 --> 03:54:43.760
Are we allowing ambush in our discussion? Because humans would call this cheating, perhaps.

03:54:43.760 --> 03:54:52.640
Yes, we would. Humans are pretty damn good at it too. And then the third is endurance.

03:54:55.600 --> 03:55:03.280
Some species, some people, humans actually are pretty good at this, use endurance as a weapon,

03:55:03.280 --> 03:55:09.440
and they simply wear an opponent down over time and break them. Internationally,

03:55:09.440 --> 03:55:16.560
this can be done economically through numbers, et cetera, et cetera. And you can destroy someone

03:55:16.560 --> 03:55:19.680
with sheer endurance. Yeah, a lot of wars throughout human

03:55:19.680 --> 03:55:23.680
history has been siege warfare. Yeah. And so when you ask yourself,

03:55:23.680 --> 03:55:29.600
okay, which one of these animals are going to be the most successful in combat? Ask yourself.

03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:34.800
Well, there's these three elements which tend to determine success or failure in warfare.

03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:42.640
Which animals exhibit these three principles the best? And we'll discuss this. But as far as

03:55:45.120 --> 03:55:50.880
generalities go, whenever you ask a question, who will win between A and B, ask yourself

03:55:51.680 --> 03:55:53.840
in terms of the light of what we've just discussed.

03:55:56.160 --> 03:56:02.800
What is their skillset? What are their attributes, both mental and physical? What is their experience

03:56:02.800 --> 03:56:08.240
in utilizing these in real world situations? And then the four more tactical elements,

03:56:08.240 --> 03:56:12.320
who gets to initiate contact? Can you break off contact at any given time?

03:56:13.120 --> 03:56:18.720
What is your endurance? Can you keep going longer than your opponent does?

03:56:18.720 --> 03:56:24.080
So with skillset, I wonder if a big component of that of how much practice there is off the

03:56:24.080 --> 03:56:29.840
battlefield. So how much quote unquote, you would probably call it play, like play fighting.

03:56:29.840 --> 03:56:33.520
Let's start going through our animals. Okay. When you look at the gorilla,

03:56:34.320 --> 03:56:40.480
you will see immediately that almost every experience a gorilla has of combat is theatrical.

03:56:41.440 --> 03:56:51.760
Yes. They don't engage in killing things. They scare rival males away in order to gain ownership

03:56:51.760 --> 03:56:59.280
of females. But there is almost no intra-species death in those conflicts. They're almost entirely

03:56:59.280 --> 03:57:05.760
theatrical. They have, for example, enormous canine teeth, but there is no record of them

03:57:05.760 --> 03:57:13.760
ever being used in combat. They appear to be used purely for intimidation purposes.

03:57:18.320 --> 03:57:24.480
There's a sense in which they have this tremendous appearance and they have tremendous potential.

03:57:25.200 --> 03:57:33.600
They really do have freakish levels of strength in many different ways. And yet the actual track

03:57:33.680 --> 03:57:39.680
record of using it is negligible. So strange that evolution would develop such a powerful

03:57:39.680 --> 03:57:44.720
killing machine. Their bite force just makes no sense with regard to what they actually eat.

03:57:47.120 --> 03:57:50.160
Even the presence of canines doesn't make a lot of sense. They're not going to use them.

03:57:51.360 --> 03:57:58.480
It comes down to this idea that their big thing is intimidation. So the show, you want to fake it

03:57:58.480 --> 03:58:03.120
and don't care if you ever make it because fake is good enough given that particular dynamic.

03:58:03.120 --> 03:58:13.840
Now let's contrast that with a male lion. Lions take on the biggest, meanest,

03:58:14.640 --> 03:58:23.040
toughest animals in the most competitive killing war on planet Earth, which is continental Africa.

03:58:23.920 --> 03:58:36.480
Occasionally they lose, but it's rare and they take out everything. Just in order to eat,

03:58:36.480 --> 03:58:44.000
they have to take down wildebeest, Cape buffalo. Cape buffalo are incredibly dangerous beasts just

03:58:44.000 --> 03:58:51.120
by themselves and yet lions regularly take them down. Occasionally large numbers of lions will

03:58:51.200 --> 03:58:57.760
even swarm elephant and over 12 hour periods take down elephant on some occasions. This is all on

03:58:57.760 --> 03:59:04.640
video. This is not just speculation. So they just have a level of combat experience which

03:59:04.640 --> 03:59:12.160
no other animal can do. If I were to also project the Eastern European style of wrestling where

03:59:12.160 --> 03:59:17.360
they spend so many hours on the mat, they really value the number of hours on the mat at play from

03:59:17.360 --> 03:59:24.480
childhood. The lions probably from my extensive watching videos on YouTube, they seem to play

03:59:24.480 --> 03:59:30.320
with each other for fun a lot. And I guess with the gorilla, you don't interact, you don't play

03:59:30.320 --> 03:59:38.080
with other gorillas. You're more spending a lot more time around the opposite sex.

03:59:38.400 --> 03:59:48.000
Yeah. I mean, even lions when they fight each other, the mortality rate when lions fight

03:59:48.000 --> 03:59:55.440
each other, male lions for ownership of a pride is very, very high, much, much higher than I believe

03:59:55.440 --> 04:00:02.080
any other species on earth. They almost always fights to the death for the simple reason that

04:00:02.160 --> 04:00:08.320
when a male lion loses control of a pride, the first act the new lion does is to kill the

04:00:08.320 --> 04:00:13.440
genetic offspring of the previous male lion. So when a lion fights another male lion, when one

04:00:13.440 --> 04:00:18.240
male lion fights another, it's not just a fight for his own life, it's a fight for his genetic

04:00:19.840 --> 04:00:27.520
offspring. And failure means not only does he die, all his offspring dies. And so when they fight,

04:00:27.520 --> 04:00:34.240
the implications are so deep. It's like a fight for not just you, but your DNA.

04:00:37.280 --> 04:00:44.640
Most male lions have very short runs at the top. They get killed or run off by other lions.

04:00:47.360 --> 04:00:54.560
Now, this kind of harsh combat experience, no other animal can claim to have this between

04:00:55.200 --> 04:01:01.520
what they kill to eat and what they have to do to defend their steak and a pride.

04:01:02.640 --> 04:01:11.760
No other animal fights like that. They just bring a level of depth to combat which is unmatched in

04:01:11.760 --> 04:01:19.280
the animal kingdom. They also have some other elements too that they get the luxury because

04:01:19.280 --> 04:01:25.200
of their social nature of taking more risks than other animals. Like a tiger hunts alone,

04:01:25.200 --> 04:01:30.880
so if it gets injured, it's a big problem. It can die if it's injured. A lion can fight

04:01:32.240 --> 04:01:36.480
Cape buffalo, get injured and be covered by the other lions for food until it recovers.

04:01:37.520 --> 04:01:43.680
So it learns to take risks and it's not afraid to go out and fight very, very hard. Whereas other

04:01:43.680 --> 04:01:49.760
animals tend to shy away from risk because they're solitary. Bears are solitary. Tigers are

04:01:49.760 --> 04:01:54.800
solitary. So they learn from an early age not to take the big risks, to go up to a certain level

04:01:54.800 --> 04:02:01.440
and stop. If I could push back. So that's aggression and risk taking. That's a plus for the lion.

04:02:01.440 --> 04:02:07.600
But to defend the gorilla, because you said skillset, they are of all of those, the only

04:02:07.600 --> 04:02:15.200
ones that use tools have shown to use tools. We didn't say anything about weapons. A gorilla

04:02:15.200 --> 04:02:25.360
could in theory pick up a rock and it does have the force, the power and the capabilities to do

04:02:25.360 --> 04:02:31.280
a lot of damage. It doesn't have the practice. It doesn't have the experience. But don't you think

04:02:32.080 --> 04:02:39.680
if a gorilla's back is to the wall, so you put them in a situation of it is life and death

04:02:40.560 --> 04:02:45.680
for both the lion and the gorilla. Don't you value intelligence at least a little bit here?

04:02:46.480 --> 04:02:53.120
There's a reason why humans, this is like evidence that humans have spread all across

04:02:53.120 --> 04:03:00.880
the world while being kind of weak. Why? Okay. Intelligence is a huge, huge asset. Humanity is

04:03:01.600 --> 04:03:09.280
positive proof that it is the most important asset, but it takes time in order to work its

04:03:09.280 --> 04:03:15.280
magic. It took humans 200,000 years to go from the bottom of the food chain to the top of the

04:03:15.280 --> 04:03:20.080
food chain. And gorillas have a lot of work to do before they get to that level.

04:03:22.560 --> 04:03:26.320
You said in theory gorillas could do this, but let's talk about practice now.

04:03:27.120 --> 04:03:32.160
First off, there are many documented incidents of leopards killing gorillas.

04:03:33.680 --> 04:03:36.800
That's anecdotal evidence. No, it's not anecdotal. There's a bunch of

04:03:36.800 --> 04:03:42.640
bitch ass gorillas walking around. We know this. We're asking. Not anecdotal. It was observed by

04:03:42.640 --> 04:03:48.240
a group of people who specialized in observing gorillas over a 12 year period. They regularly

04:03:48.240 --> 04:03:57.760
found gorilla toes in leopard defecation. They also saw that over a certain period,

04:03:57.760 --> 04:04:04.080
some 36 gorillas had been killed and evidence strongly suggested leopard predation was the

04:04:04.080 --> 04:04:11.280
reason. Apparently the leopards had figured out that there was a femoral artery in gorillas legs

04:04:11.280 --> 04:04:15.440
and were doing a move, which from the sounds of it sounds a lot like a baron bolo. They were

04:04:15.440 --> 04:04:19.520
spinning underneath gorillas and biting the femoral artery and then disengaging and watching

04:04:19.520 --> 04:04:28.320
them bleed out and die and then eating them. Now a leopard is no match for a lion. The only

04:04:28.320 --> 04:04:33.920
defense it has to a lion is to run up a tree. It cannot engage with a lion on anything close to

04:04:33.920 --> 04:04:38.240
equal terms. It may seem like we're going on tangents, but we're not just because of the foot,

04:04:38.240 --> 04:04:43.920
the attack of the artery on the foot. Is there weaknesses that the lion might have of that?

04:04:43.920 --> 04:04:49.920
What I'm saying is I know it's not equivalent, but the fact that a leopard does so well against

04:04:49.920 --> 04:04:56.400
even fully grown male gorillas should make you rather suspicious of a gorilla's ability to fight

04:04:56.400 --> 04:05:01.200
a lion. Fair enough. Let's also go further into this about concentration of force.

04:05:02.160 --> 04:05:07.440
A lion has the quintessential concentration of force, which is fangs and claws.

04:05:08.240 --> 04:05:15.760
The gorilla is the exact opposite. It can't even make a fist. It can only throw open-handed slaps

04:05:15.760 --> 04:05:22.640
and grab things. It has no ability with its arms to concentrate force in any kind of efficient way.

04:05:22.640 --> 04:05:30.400
When a lion or a tiger or a bear for that matter swings at you, it's got four claws from four to

04:05:30.400 --> 04:05:35.600
six inches long. That's like four blades going into you. They can retract their claws so they're

04:05:35.600 --> 04:05:40.800
always sharp. But the reach is significantly longer for the gorilla. The length of the-

04:05:40.800 --> 04:05:45.760
The ability to engage with speed on the part of the cats is far, far greater.

04:05:45.760 --> 04:05:51.600
And also mobility on two feet, the bipedal nature of a gorilla, the temporary bipedal.

04:05:51.600 --> 04:05:58.400
The bear has the same. It has no impact. Humans are bipedal and lions kill 240 humans a year on

04:05:58.400 --> 04:06:07.760
average. So, okay. Okay. Okay. What about bear? Now bear is a different proposition.

04:06:07.760 --> 04:06:14.960
For all the same things that a lion has, the claws, the teeth has more weight, has more strength,

04:06:15.520 --> 04:06:22.880
has more power. Okay. Now this is an interesting question. Okay. You get a fully grown

04:06:22.880 --> 04:06:26.400
North American grizzly versus an African lion. This is an interesting bet.

04:06:26.400 --> 04:06:30.960
I also have questions about polar bears. It's unclear to me because they're bigger in every way

04:06:32.080 --> 04:06:35.680
than a grizzly, but they probably don't get the experience in the practice.

04:06:35.680 --> 04:06:43.360
Yeah. Also, they have a much more limited set of animals that they prey upon. So I'm pretty

04:06:43.360 --> 04:06:51.360
sure grizzly is going to be tough to beat as far as top bear goes. A grizzly bear,

04:06:52.240 --> 04:06:59.200
I believe would be a formidable adversary even for a male lion. They're literally twice their size.

04:07:00.240 --> 04:07:06.560
They have an ability to get away from strangleholds by standing up on two legs. So the lion's

04:07:06.560 --> 04:07:11.360
primary method of killing, which is to strangle, would be very difficult for them to employ upon

04:07:11.360 --> 04:07:19.360
a bear. Interestingly, the bear's primary method of killing is to pin. It pins animals and then just

04:07:19.360 --> 04:07:23.440
slowly eats them while they're still alive. They have a rather barbaric means of killing.

04:07:24.240 --> 04:07:32.240
Lions are much more humane in the way they kill. What I see as the primary problem is that neither

04:07:32.240 --> 04:07:36.000
one would be able to kill the other. That finishing thing that you mentioned.

04:07:36.000 --> 04:07:41.440
Yeah. They would both fail on the finishing criteria. The lion would not be able to strangle

04:07:41.440 --> 04:07:47.120
a bear. Even in a best case scenario where he got his teeth into the neck, the bear can stand up and

04:07:47.120 --> 04:07:58.080
presumably shake him off. The bear would never be able to pin a lion for long enough to better hold

04:07:58.080 --> 04:08:05.120
it down and slowly maul it over time the way it can with an elk or a caribou. So I don't believe

04:08:05.120 --> 04:08:08.240
either would be able to finish the other. They would just become exhausted.

04:08:08.240 --> 04:08:12.960
It would come down to endurance. Now that's where things get interesting because the bear

04:08:12.960 --> 04:08:17.280
is much more of an endurance hunter and the lion is much more of an ambush hunter.

04:08:17.920 --> 04:08:24.080
Lions quick, explosive, much higher top speed. They've got a top speed of 45 to 50 miles an hour.

04:08:24.080 --> 04:08:30.080
A bear can do up to 35, but it can run for long periods at up to 25 miles an hour. Very long

04:08:30.080 --> 04:08:38.480
periods. They're mostly an endurance hunter. They just run elk and moose down until they're exhausted

04:08:38.480 --> 04:08:43.920
and then pin them and kill them. So if it came down to endurance, it might go the way of the

04:08:43.920 --> 04:08:54.080
bear if they were caged up together. However, there is very strong evidence from both hunters and

04:08:55.440 --> 04:09:05.600
video which shows on many occasions bears being chased off by cougar and wolverines.

04:09:06.560 --> 04:09:10.160
Now- What's that? That's fear? What do you mean chased off?

04:09:10.800 --> 04:09:18.240
If they fight over meat and say, for example, the cougar has killed something and the bear wants

04:09:18.240 --> 04:09:22.240
the meat, the cougar will chase off the bear. The bear has risk aversion.

04:09:22.240 --> 04:09:27.200
Exactly. Exactly. The bear is a risk averse. What I would say is this, the bears are very,

04:09:27.200 --> 04:09:32.000
very powerful in their domain, but they don't have the battle experience of a lion.

04:09:32.720 --> 04:09:36.720
They don't take on animals as tough as a cape buffalo. They don't take on elephant.

04:09:37.360 --> 04:09:44.240
The toughest thing it would probably take on would probably be a bull moose. A bull moose is a

04:09:44.240 --> 04:09:50.720
formidable animal, but it's nothing like a cape buffalo. It's nothing like an elephant or a

04:09:50.720 --> 04:09:58.320
hippopotamus. So what I would suggest is this, in the wild, I don't believe either one is capable

04:09:58.320 --> 04:10:03.200
of killing the other, but I do believe based on video evidence of cougars and wolverines

04:10:03.200 --> 04:10:11.840
chasing off bears, that a lion would provide enough threat in a brief fight that a bear would

04:10:11.840 --> 04:10:17.360
back away. If you put them in a cage, however, where neither one could back away, I would

04:10:17.360 --> 04:10:22.480
slightly favor the bear based on the fact that neither one can kill each other. It would come

04:10:22.480 --> 04:10:24.720
down to endurance. You mean like an octagon.

04:10:24.720 --> 04:10:28.880
Yeah. That's got to be the next UFC, by the way. Bear versus lion.

04:10:28.880 --> 04:10:32.800
But things change. Joe Rogan is a big fan of the idea of fighting in a stadium,

04:10:32.800 --> 04:10:37.920
for humans fighting in a stadium. So in the stadium, a bear-

04:10:37.920 --> 04:10:43.040
I would slightly favor a bear. Now, I still think that the lion would have a chance,

04:10:43.040 --> 04:10:48.640
but I would favor the bear in a betting match. Some of the best evidence we have for animal

04:10:48.640 --> 04:10:53.920
versus animal fights come from the ancient Romans who actually used to put animals in gladiatorial

04:10:53.920 --> 04:11:02.240
combat. And they, for example, had several incidents where they wrote about tiger versus lion

04:11:03.920 --> 04:11:13.040
conflict. And in one famous passage, they described a lion getting destroyed by a female tiger.

04:11:14.080 --> 04:11:20.480
So there's some evidence to suggest that they had more expertise of this than we do because

04:11:21.280 --> 04:11:25.760
they had a big population of wild animals, which they just put to fight each other.

04:11:27.600 --> 04:11:33.760
Unfortunately, there's nothing that they wrote about bears versus lion. They did talk about

04:11:34.400 --> 04:11:42.560
bears versus bulls. They did talk about lions versus tigers, but they never mentioned bear

04:11:42.560 --> 04:11:47.200
versus lion. So we don't have any evidence for that. So we have to be a little bit more speculative.

04:11:47.200 --> 04:11:53.440
Now, given that bears do get chased off by cougar and cougar is weak compared with a male lion-

04:11:53.440 --> 04:11:55.280
Well, listen to you draw from that, by the way.

04:11:55.280 --> 04:11:56.640
I would suggest that-

04:11:56.640 --> 04:11:58.240
Is it about the bear or is it about the cougar?

04:11:58.240 --> 04:12:02.000
It's more about the bear. In theory, a bear should be able to crush a cougar,

04:12:02.000 --> 04:12:07.680
but it seems to be the bear is just saying, this thing could hurt me, so I'm not going to risk

04:12:07.680 --> 04:12:13.760
injury and backs away. I think it would back away in the wild from a lion, but put him in a cage,

04:12:14.400 --> 04:12:17.840
and I slightly favor the grizzly based on endurance.

04:12:20.160 --> 04:12:26.720
So the final conclusion, if you had to just bet everything you own. So you got, let's say,

04:12:27.280 --> 04:12:33.920
we got the octagon, we're bringing in a bear. Now this is like legendary bear.

04:12:33.920 --> 04:12:34.480
Okay.

04:12:34.480 --> 04:12:35.680
Full grown grizzly.

04:12:35.680 --> 04:12:39.840
Full grown grizzly, but not only that, that grizzly has seen some shit.

04:12:40.480 --> 04:12:42.720
What's the most it could have seen? A bull moose?

04:12:43.760 --> 04:12:46.400
A caribou? That's the toughest opponent it's ever had.

04:12:46.400 --> 04:12:53.280
It once, no, no, no, no. No, this one once ran into a pack of other grizzlies and had to defend.

04:12:55.040 --> 04:12:55.920
He's got scars.

04:12:55.920 --> 04:12:58.880
A pack of grizzlies, isn't a pack of grizzlies? It's solitary.

04:12:58.880 --> 04:13:00.400
Wolves, wolves, wolves.

04:13:00.400 --> 04:13:03.040
Wolves are enough practice for a bear. Who attacks a bear?

04:13:03.600 --> 04:13:06.400
That's my point. Bears don't really live in a competitive environment.

04:13:06.400 --> 04:13:06.720
Lions do.

04:13:06.720 --> 04:13:10.320
But sometimes it can get desperate as it was a pack of wolves.

04:13:11.040 --> 04:13:15.200
But that pack of wolves is nothing. It's nothing.

04:13:15.200 --> 04:13:16.080
All right, fine.

04:13:16.080 --> 04:13:17.520
Lions deal with packs of hyenas.

04:13:18.880 --> 04:13:23.680
Just imagine, over the past hundred years, what do you think is the hardest fight

04:13:24.880 --> 04:13:28.640
that a grizzly bear has been in? Like somewhere in Alaska, we never heard.

04:13:28.640 --> 04:13:32.240
All of a sudden, in the middle of the night, all you hear is the bear just.

04:13:32.240 --> 04:13:34.560
Yeah, they didn't really, there's nothing that tough.

04:13:34.560 --> 04:13:38.080
There's gotta have been something. Humans have killed tens of millions of people in wars.

04:13:38.080 --> 04:13:40.000
They run away from cougars and wolverines.

04:13:40.560 --> 04:13:43.920
No, that's anecdotal evidence. There's gotta be one bear.

04:13:43.920 --> 04:13:46.000
There's video footage of it. You can watch it yourself.

04:13:46.000 --> 04:13:50.720
That's called anecdotal evidence. I guarantee you, in the dark of the night,

04:13:51.360 --> 04:13:56.880
there was an epic battle of which there's still legend amongst the bears in that part of Canada.

04:13:56.880 --> 04:13:58.720
Who did it battle? In Canada?

04:13:59.440 --> 04:14:02.400
Moose. Other bears. You don't think they'd go at it.

04:14:02.400 --> 04:14:06.080
Yeah, bears fight each other, but it's largely theatrical. They never kill each other.

04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:08.080
When lions fight each other, they kill each other all the time.

04:14:10.560 --> 04:14:13.040
Someone would have seen it by now. Interesting.

04:14:13.680 --> 04:14:19.680
All right. My point is that bears, they want to get their feet wet.

04:14:19.680 --> 04:14:23.840
You're giving no credit for gorillas, so you're saying lion wins. Your money's on the lion.

04:14:23.840 --> 04:14:28.400
I'm saying lion would win in the wild because they can't kill each other. They can't end the

04:14:28.400 --> 04:14:35.040
fight. That's one of our most important criteria. But lions can almost always initiate the action

04:14:35.040 --> 04:14:41.440
because they have much better ability to see at night, for example. Bears have very average

04:14:41.440 --> 04:14:46.720
night vision. Lions have superb night vision. At nighttime, they can always initiate the fight.

04:14:47.280 --> 04:14:52.000
Lions are natural ambush predators, so it's always going to have the advantage of ambush.

04:14:53.040 --> 04:14:57.680
The great advantage that bears have is endurance, but bears are very risk averse,

04:14:57.680 --> 04:15:02.800
and they're not used to fighting the toughest, toughest animals. The toughest animal they fight

04:15:02.800 --> 04:15:08.720
is a moose or a caribou. These are not even close to the animals that lions have to go

04:15:08.720 --> 04:15:12.480
up against on a regular basis. So if somebody wins, it's going to be the lion for you.

04:15:13.280 --> 04:15:18.800
I still think that the size and endurance of the bear, if they were locked in a cage together,

04:15:18.800 --> 04:15:22.240
I would still favor the bear under those circumstances. But in the wild, I believe

04:15:22.240 --> 04:15:26.160
the bear will back away quickly from the lion. But in the cage, no time limit you favor the bear.

04:15:26.160 --> 04:15:29.520
What if it's five rounds or five minutes championship round? Then I would go with

04:15:29.520 --> 04:15:35.360
the lion because the lion has a huge speed advantage. It's going to injure it, tear it up,

04:15:35.360 --> 04:15:40.560
and do immediate damage. I'll put it this way. If lion and bear fight, first 15 minutes,

04:15:40.560 --> 04:15:47.440
I favor the lion 100%. But then as time goes by, that size and weight and endurance is going to

04:15:47.440 --> 04:15:52.400
have an effect. I'll bring up shortly somebody that's going to probably disagree with you about

04:15:52.400 --> 04:15:55.440
some things. Hopefully it's a grizzly bear and he comes in and just eats me.

04:15:55.920 --> 04:16:03.040
Oh, that would be so epic. Make a hell of a podcast. I wonder who he would eat first,

04:16:03.040 --> 04:16:07.680
who would look scarier, more delicious. I'm not sure. The black and white could either

04:16:07.680 --> 04:16:14.720
piss him off. He would think you were a penguin. Is that a good thing or not? Not good. If it was

04:16:14.720 --> 04:16:23.280
a polar bear, maybe it's different. So you care deeply about athletes you coached, about people

04:16:23.280 --> 04:16:30.720
in your life. I have to ask this question. If one of those athletes, let's say Gordon Ryan,

04:16:32.400 --> 04:16:38.320
I was the dictator of the world and this would entertain me, so I force you and Gordon to do this

04:16:39.360 --> 04:16:46.640
to fight a bear or a lion. Gordon has to. How would you coach him to do it,

04:16:47.600 --> 04:16:56.400
to have any chance of winning? He goes in empty handed. You can choose stadium or cage.

04:16:57.360 --> 04:17:02.960
Gordon Ryan, empty handed versus a lion. You get to choose lion versus bear. It's up to you.

04:17:04.320 --> 04:17:11.120
My advice would be very simple. I would say Gordon, you're fucked. You're going to die badly.

04:17:12.080 --> 04:17:16.560
Choose the lion because it will strangle you to death rather than pin you down and maul you to

04:17:16.560 --> 04:17:24.400
death. Didn't we just talk about audacious goals? This is not a question of audacious goals. This

04:17:24.400 --> 04:17:29.520
is a question of minimizing pain. So you coach your athletes to quit before the battle has been

04:17:29.520 --> 04:17:37.440
fought. 100%. Yeah. You don't think he has a chance? How? What's he going to do? You don't

04:17:37.440 --> 04:17:41.600
think there's a technical, first of all, intelligence. What's he going to do, a heel hook? No,

04:17:42.320 --> 04:17:48.000
first of all, maybe. He's got four fucking legs. Okay. What if Gordon gets any starting position

04:17:48.000 --> 04:17:53.440
he wants? That's going to be really useful. You don't think he's going to have back control?

04:17:53.440 --> 04:17:58.480
On a thousand pound bear, what good would back control? Shaken off? Shaken off. He'll get torn

04:17:58.480 --> 04:18:07.680
off. With what? He's got four, six inch claws. I wonder what is the reach. Whatever he touches,

04:18:07.760 --> 04:18:12.160
he's going to destroy it. What if it's not a flexible bear? So you think there's no control.

04:18:12.160 --> 04:18:18.560
What about a low, some kind of controlling position from, yeah, like you said Marble,

04:18:18.560 --> 04:18:24.800
like from underneath. Nothing? This discussion is so insane. I didn't even know where to begin

04:18:24.800 --> 04:18:29.840
criticism. I don't think you're open-minded enough. We could turn this down. Forget about Gordon

04:18:29.920 --> 04:18:37.280
fighting a lion or a bear. That's completely impossible. An adult male chimp will destroy

04:18:37.280 --> 04:18:45.360
Gordon. So not even a gorilla? A male chimp is more than enough to kill any human on the planet,

04:18:45.360 --> 04:18:52.320
including Gordon Ryan. So Gordon Ryan fighting a chimp, a good size, no, a thousand times. How

04:18:52.320 --> 04:18:57.840
many times does he win? He loses a thousand times. It's not even competitive. It's not even remotely

04:18:57.840 --> 04:19:04.960
competitive. Do you think he will disagree? No. Do you think anyone will disagree? Anyone? Yeah,

04:19:04.960 --> 04:19:15.040
morons. Okay. Somebody that I think you might know is a famous actor, Tom Hardy, but he's also

04:19:15.040 --> 04:19:21.760
doing quite a bit of jiu-jitsu. The reason this makes sense to bring up now is he's also, I saw

04:19:21.760 --> 04:19:27.920
narrating a new Sky original series called Predators coming out in December, where they

04:19:27.920 --> 04:19:32.800
follow five different predators and tell their full story about all the fighting and the killing

04:19:32.800 --> 04:19:41.760
and all that kind of stuff. And he's doing that. He's like Morgan Freeman from March of the Penguins.

04:19:41.760 --> 04:19:50.560
It's Tom Hardy for the predators. So I saw a bear and a lion in the trailer, but they also had

04:19:50.560 --> 04:19:54.720
something, I didn't watch it too careful, but they had something like a hyena. So I think they

04:19:54.720 --> 04:19:59.520
were talking about, I don't know if it's a hyena, but something like that, like pack animals that

04:19:59.520 --> 04:20:05.840
attack. Hyenas are formidable, formidable animals. So it's not all about size. It's about strategy.

04:20:05.840 --> 04:20:11.360
Yeah. The most important thing in nature is numbers. A pack of animals will always destroy

04:20:11.360 --> 04:20:16.880
a single animal. And I think that show in particular is not 100% about who wins or so on.

04:20:16.880 --> 04:20:23.520
It's about the fascinating stories of how these predators sort of dominate their particular

04:20:23.520 --> 04:20:28.160
environment because it's not about these like artificial match-ups. It's about giving your

04:20:28.160 --> 04:20:33.440
environment, how you succeed and all that kind of stuff. Maybe we could do Gordon Ryan versus a

04:20:33.440 --> 04:20:40.240
house cat. Gordon might have a small chance against a house cat. Maybe, maybe.

04:20:40.240 --> 04:20:46.320
Maybe. See, now I know you're just trolling me. I think Gordon has a chance against,

04:20:47.600 --> 04:20:54.080
definitely against the smaller apes, but I have no way of proving it. And the internet will say I'm

04:20:54.080 --> 04:20:59.120
an idiot. So there you go. Yeah, the internet is correct every so often. So there's a, oh,

04:20:59.120 --> 04:21:03.200
it's funny enough. I'm looking at Tom's Instagram. Here's a picture with Hanzo. He's competed

04:21:03.200 --> 04:21:07.600
recently, which is very cool in Jiu-Jitsu. That's awesome. That's tough to do for a celebrity to

04:21:07.600 --> 04:21:12.640
step up. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. He used to consult with me a little bit on

04:21:14.080 --> 04:21:18.880
moves when he was starting out. He's a very, very nice person. Oh, about Jiu-Jitsu? Yeah.

04:21:18.880 --> 04:21:22.560
Yeah. He asked questions about Jiu-Jitsu. He struck me as being a very, very nice person.

04:21:22.560 --> 04:21:28.000
I would love to be a fly in that wall, but he made a post on Instagram, which I'd love to get

04:21:28.000 --> 04:21:34.320
your opinion on. He has very much like a John Donahue style of digging into the philosophy of

04:21:34.320 --> 04:21:40.320
the impact of Jiu-Jitsu on one's life. Is his Instagram post 18 pages long? Yes.

04:21:41.120 --> 04:21:48.640
He's got potential then. Yes. With a profound, deep picture of somebody practicing the art of

04:21:48.640 --> 04:21:56.320
Jiu-Jitsu. I think he's at least a trainee in this art of the Donahue style of communication.

04:21:57.120 --> 04:22:01.440
If Miyamoto Musashi would be alive today, he would probably be doing these five page Instagram posts

04:22:01.440 --> 04:22:08.160
like you do. Addiction, writes Tom Hardy, addiction is difficult and complex stuff to navigate

04:22:08.160 --> 04:22:12.880
as is mental health subjects, which are both deeply personal for me and extremely close to my

04:22:12.880 --> 04:22:18.640
heart. It is an honor to be able to represent the charity and my team reorg and the great work they

04:22:18.640 --> 04:22:23.360
do supporting the mental health and wellbeing of veterans of service, military and first responders

04:22:23.360 --> 04:22:28.400
through the therapeutic benefits of Jiu-Jitsu and fitness training. He represented them in this

04:22:28.480 --> 04:22:34.960
competition that he competed in. Simple training for me as a hobby and a private love has been

04:22:34.960 --> 04:22:40.560
fundamentally key to further develop a deeper sense of inner resilience, calm and wellbeing.

04:22:40.560 --> 04:22:46.400
I can't stress the importance it has had and the impact of my life and my fellow teammates.

04:22:46.400 --> 04:22:53.840
He goes on to talk about this organization reorg that uses Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to form a therapy

04:22:53.840 --> 04:22:57.440
to overcome physical and mental challenges, strengthen social connections and improve

04:22:57.440 --> 04:23:02.480
overall health and wellbeing. This is for veterans, for people going through PTSD.

04:23:03.600 --> 04:23:07.680
They have saved lives around the world by not only providing an effective and positive means

04:23:07.680 --> 04:23:11.760
for navigating and managing the challenging psychological aspects of military and first

04:23:11.760 --> 04:23:17.520
responder careers, but also has allowed many to find a renewed sense of purpose, identity

04:23:17.520 --> 04:23:23.920
and community that's often lost when transitioning to civilian life. Do you have thoughts about that,

04:23:23.920 --> 04:23:29.600
sort of the effects of Jiu-Jitsu on folks who've gone through some really difficult

04:23:30.720 --> 04:23:38.240
things in their life? First off, I think that's just a beautiful statement by Mr. Hardy. I must

04:23:39.840 --> 04:23:43.760
give him a phone call after this and talk to him. That was beautiful to read.

04:23:44.320 --> 04:23:55.120
One thing that's always struck me when I train people who either have a military background or

04:23:55.920 --> 04:24:01.760
on more than a few occasions, we have special forces soldiers come in and train with us for

04:24:02.400 --> 04:24:06.000
a week or two. When you talk to them,

04:24:06.000 --> 04:24:14.800
the overwhelming sentiment I get when the conversation is over and we go our separate

04:24:14.800 --> 04:24:21.520
ways is I'm always asking myself the transition from military life, especially the more extreme

04:24:21.520 --> 04:24:31.520
military lives of special forces soldiers back to civilian life, it must be the craziest experience

04:24:31.520 --> 04:24:44.080
of all. You've got people who are fighting and dying alongside their comrades in the most

04:24:44.080 --> 04:24:51.040
extreme circumstances that any human being can go through and then they're pulled back into a life

04:24:51.040 --> 04:25:00.320
where people are arguing with them over parking spots. The average person's day-to-day life is

04:25:00.320 --> 04:25:08.800
so mundane that imagine what must be going through a man's head who a few weeks or months ago was

04:25:08.800 --> 04:25:15.280
literally fighting for his life and his comrade's lives, watching people that he loved die or get

04:25:15.280 --> 04:25:23.440
mutilated in front of him. In a matter of seconds, people's lives can be torn apart and change

04:25:23.440 --> 04:25:27.360
forever and then suddenly you get thrown into a life where people are arguing over

04:25:28.320 --> 04:25:35.280
who's cut who off who in line to buy a coffee. The intensity of camaraderie and love that you have

04:25:35.280 --> 04:25:44.720
for each other. And then you go from incredible intensity in war to just mundane, boring life

04:25:45.280 --> 04:25:51.840
and going from one to the other where people are yelling at you or nagging you over issues that

04:25:52.240 --> 04:25:55.920
just seem so inconsequential compared to what you've been through.

04:25:56.800 --> 04:26:00.160
And you're supposed to take these people seriously and listen to them.

04:26:00.160 --> 04:26:11.360
But not only that, you do have trauma visions of dead brothers and sisters and you feel like you

04:26:11.360 --> 04:26:17.200
can't really talk to these civilians about it. There's nothing in their experience that would

04:26:17.200 --> 04:26:24.320
enable you to have a conversation with them. How do you talk to your new girlfriend about

04:26:25.200 --> 04:26:29.840
watching one of your friend's legs get taken off? There's no conversation you could have with them.

04:26:32.800 --> 04:26:40.480
I find that typically they do best when they hang out with each other because they have

04:26:40.480 --> 04:26:48.880
shared experience and they can talk about these things. But I do find that most Judiciary schools

04:26:48.880 --> 04:26:59.600
have something like a kind of military barracks demeanor to them of like camaraderie, hard work,

04:27:00.240 --> 04:27:09.360
shared hard work, teamwork, building towards a goal over time, the acquisition of skills,

04:27:09.360 --> 04:27:16.400
usually along with that, a kind of want of a better word rustic and primitive sense of humor

04:27:16.400 --> 04:27:23.840
and a kind of soldierly way of talking to each other and disparaging, self-deprecating sense

04:27:23.840 --> 04:27:29.360
of humor. And it's something that most people with military service kind of naturally come into

04:27:29.360 --> 04:27:34.080
because it's part of what they were in. And so it's like a toned down version of it, which enables

04:27:34.080 --> 04:27:42.560
them to form a stepping stone between the military life that they were in

04:27:43.440 --> 04:27:48.640
all the way down to civilian life. And jiu-jitsu was kind of like a bridge between those two.

04:27:49.200 --> 04:27:54.720
And also the honesty. So you said like the skill acquisition, the honesty of really testing that

04:27:54.720 --> 04:28:03.440
skill. There is a deep honesty to war in a distant way, but in a way there is an honesty to jiu-jitsu

04:28:04.160 --> 04:28:09.360
of technique working and not. And there is simulated death. It's not real death,

04:28:09.360 --> 04:28:13.120
it's simulated death on the mat. And there's a similar kind of honesty there.

04:28:13.120 --> 04:28:19.920
And there's also a similar kind of esteem towards skill. Just as regular soldiers look up to special

04:28:19.920 --> 04:28:26.000
forces soldiers because they see them as people who have greater skill than themselves, something

04:28:26.000 --> 04:28:32.160
to aspire to, so too in jiu-jitsu. The thing that we esteem most on the jiu-jitsu mat is skill.

04:28:32.160 --> 04:28:37.520
No one gives a damn what you look like or what you think. You're judged mostly by your skill

04:28:37.520 --> 04:28:47.520
level. And so they tend to identify with that. I do think that most people from a military

04:28:47.520 --> 04:28:54.480
background kind of find a natural gravitation towards the atmosphere of jiu-jitsu learning.

04:28:54.480 --> 04:29:01.360
And if it proves to be a positive way for them to rehabilitate and come back into civilian life, then

04:29:02.160 --> 04:29:10.320
that's a wonderful, wonderful thing. I know we're linked with We Defy, which is an organization

04:29:10.320 --> 04:29:18.160
which caters to former soldiers who were badly injured in combat and many of whom lost limbs

04:29:18.160 --> 04:29:27.920
and or suffered mental trauma. And they come in and train and they often speak very, very highly

04:29:27.920 --> 04:29:33.120
of the degree to which jiu-jitsu has helped them come back into civilian life. And for them,

04:29:33.120 --> 04:29:39.680
it's even worse because they come back not only mentally but physically disadvantaged after war.

04:29:42.240 --> 04:29:47.040
And I've always been proud to be associated with We Defy. And I'm very happy to see Tom

04:29:47.680 --> 04:29:51.840
working with this organization. Is this an organization based in England for English

04:29:51.840 --> 04:29:56.880
veterans or is it international? That's a good question. I'd have to look into it. It certainly

04:29:56.880 --> 04:30:06.240
is based in England, but it could be international. But it's just nice to see somebody use that large

04:30:06.240 --> 04:30:12.880
platform for that kind of message. And also to step on the mat and show the kind of jiu-jitsu

04:30:12.880 --> 04:30:17.360
you would probably be proud of when you're chasing submissions. You got an arm lock,

04:30:17.360 --> 04:30:22.320
you got a straight foot lock. We're not going to analyze the techniques because there could be

04:30:22.880 --> 04:30:26.240
different perspectives. It's the intent that counts. The finish is the finish.

04:30:27.040 --> 04:30:32.560
Yeah. No, that's impressive. He's actually quite an athlete. He's in great shape and

04:30:34.160 --> 04:30:37.920
strong and flexible. And I'm glad he's doing well with his jiu-jitsu.

04:30:37.920 --> 04:30:42.320
And it's good to see Hanzo's smiling face next to him. I can only imagine the conversations.

04:30:42.960 --> 04:30:50.960
I have to ask you a deep and important question. You often, when we text back and forth, send me

04:30:50.960 --> 04:30:57.760
two hugging emojis. Can we psychoanalyze the reason why that's your favorite emoji?

04:30:58.640 --> 04:31:08.000
Of the hugging face? It's kind of like sending a heart, but a little bit more gender neutral.

04:31:10.480 --> 04:31:15.680
When jiu-jitsu players meet each other, they often shake hands and then give a quick hug.

04:31:15.680 --> 04:31:18.880
So I thought it was the most appropriate emoji for jiu-jitsu players.

04:31:19.760 --> 04:31:23.520
I see. It's a pretty simple explanation. Nothing too fraughty in there.

04:31:23.520 --> 04:31:25.760
Are you sure? Quite sure.

04:31:25.760 --> 04:31:30.160
Okay. Have you really asked yourself deeply? Because you really lean on an emoji. Is there

04:31:30.160 --> 04:31:33.200
something behind it? Tomorrow, I'm never going to use that emoji again.

04:31:34.720 --> 04:31:38.400
Walk away. I'll shock you tomorrow and hit you with three.

04:31:39.200 --> 04:31:45.920
Three. It's almost always two. I think maybe you're a creature of habit in communication.

04:31:46.640 --> 04:31:50.720
I'm a creature of habit in almost every aspect of my life. So even emojis.

04:31:52.320 --> 04:31:56.160
Yeah. You fall into these little pockets of how you communicate, how you show affection

04:31:56.800 --> 04:32:04.240
towards others. I say love a lot. I send hearts. And don't give a fuck if it's too like,

04:32:07.200 --> 04:32:11.520
me sending a message to a CEO I'm about to interview, I'll send a heart. I don't give a

04:32:11.600 --> 04:32:17.600
damn. They'll probably just like, look, what is this? But I think people are

04:32:18.960 --> 04:32:28.240
too afraid of simple communication of affection. It could be in any form, but

04:32:29.280 --> 04:32:35.040
there's a hesitance to that because I think underneath it, in order to show affection,

04:32:35.840 --> 04:32:42.480
you're taking a risk and you're showing vulnerability. Because if you show affection

04:32:42.480 --> 04:32:49.200
and the other person rejects that affection, you've now placed yourself in a hierarchy,

04:32:49.200 --> 04:32:55.040
going back to lions, of like, oh, this person, you're just like this silly weak person and

04:32:55.040 --> 04:33:00.080
they're the strong person. I think that's how you might see it, I guess. But I don't. To me,

04:33:00.640 --> 04:33:09.280
the display of vulnerability is a display of strength, not weakness, at least in human society,

04:33:09.280 --> 04:33:13.120
at least at this time. I don't know. Let me ask you about love.

04:33:16.080 --> 04:33:20.800
I must ask John Donoher about love. What do you think is the role of love in the human condition

04:33:21.440 --> 04:33:24.320
at the highest philosophical level? Let me first ask. What's...

04:33:24.320 --> 04:33:28.480
Like romantic love?

04:33:28.480 --> 04:33:30.560
Romantic love. Let's say romantic love.

04:33:30.560 --> 04:33:39.840
I have one or two areas of apparent expertise in my life. Romantic love, definitely not one of them.

04:33:39.840 --> 04:33:45.360
So like lions versus bears, animal combat, you're pretty good at. And then different

04:33:45.360 --> 04:33:53.120
grappling arts, judo, sambo, jiu-jitsu, wrestling, MMA, so fighting and so on.

04:33:53.120 --> 04:33:54.160
Romantic love?

04:33:54.160 --> 04:34:00.320
You don't see them as similar? It's a kind of fight. It's a kind of dance. By the way, do you...

04:34:03.680 --> 04:34:08.640
There's a sense in which I'm kind of glad I'm not an expert on that. Imagine what it would be

04:34:09.760 --> 04:34:15.760
to be an expert on romantic love. You would take the one thing in life that's actually interesting

04:34:15.760 --> 04:34:20.800
and make it boring. Because once you develop an expertise about something,

04:34:20.800 --> 04:34:24.320
you can start to predict how things are going to unfold. You get answers before

04:34:24.880 --> 04:34:31.200
events even occur. You see, you can read into the future of everything. I think there are certain

04:34:31.200 --> 04:34:35.520
parts of human life where you want to be a beginner at all times and you don't want to

04:34:35.520 --> 04:34:41.040
gain expertise. So excellence and systematizing something in order to achieve excellence might

04:34:41.040 --> 04:34:45.680
destroy the very magical thing. Yes. And I think that the magic of romantic love is the fact that

04:34:45.680 --> 04:34:51.520
we're all beginners at it. And the minute you try to gain expertise in it, what does that even mean?

04:34:51.520 --> 04:34:56.080
What would it mean? And would it be good? I don't think it would. I think you're better off just

04:34:57.040 --> 04:35:00.800
having fun with it and plowing through and making dumb mistakes and looking like a fool.

04:35:03.680 --> 04:35:09.600
And then whatever success, whatever that means, comes in a kind of lighthearted,

04:35:09.600 --> 04:35:17.360
frivolous kind of way. And that I think is, over the course of a lifetime, far more desirable than

04:35:17.360 --> 04:35:23.440
having expertise and affairs of love. So I don't think it's even a good thing to study too much.

04:35:24.080 --> 04:35:28.720
And I think if you did, you would actually take something good out of your life.

04:35:30.080 --> 04:35:34.240
Yeah. So there's communities of people called pick-up artists that tried to optimize

04:35:35.200 --> 04:35:41.200
this particular aspect, which is of dating, of guys picking up girls and turning that into a

04:35:41.200 --> 04:35:47.200
system and seeing what's the most successful. I think that would be, I mean, maybe the first

04:35:47.200 --> 04:35:54.160
few months would be good. And then after that, I think it would be a disaster. I mean, given that

04:35:54.160 --> 04:36:04.320
that humans are fairly easy to study from the standpoint of psychology, I'm sure it's not that

04:36:04.320 --> 04:36:10.640
difficult to gain expertise in things like picking people up, the same way advertisers can pick up

04:36:10.640 --> 04:36:16.240
your attention to sell a product. You can do the same thing, presumably, with romance and sex. But

04:36:16.240 --> 04:36:25.200
I don't know. I feel like if you became very good at it, you would end up being very disappointed

04:36:25.200 --> 04:36:31.040
by the results. And so as I said, I think there's some things in life where it's better to be a

04:36:31.040 --> 04:36:36.560
beginner. And this is one of those, enjoy the chaos, the push and pull of being a beginner,

04:36:36.560 --> 04:36:40.800
and make that a lifelong journey. That's really inspiring to hear you say that. And there's a

04:36:40.800 --> 04:36:43.920
deep truth to that. That also justifies the fact that I suck at it.

04:36:44.800 --> 04:36:51.120
I think it also justifies, and it would sell very well, that John Donahue should write a book on

04:36:51.120 --> 04:36:56.560
dating. And that would be chapter one, embrace being a beginner. Check the tool we bear versus

04:36:56.560 --> 04:37:05.120
lion. Pivot quickly to violence. By the way, we totally skipped over Anaconda. I assumed the

04:37:05.120 --> 04:37:18.160
implied- I'll put it to you this way. On video, you can watch Puma and similar sized cats,

04:37:20.160 --> 04:37:28.640
Jaguar, destroy Anacondas, even in water, which is Anaconda's preferred domain. So

04:37:28.800 --> 04:37:36.000
given that Puma and Jaguar are at several orders below lion, you have to go with the idea that

04:37:36.000 --> 04:37:41.520
lion would utterly decimate Anaconda. So it's probably good that we did skip over it.

04:37:41.520 --> 04:37:47.440
And I think going back to the original thought that you had about this, don't trust your first

04:37:47.440 --> 04:37:53.120
instinct. Also think about the other elements. An Anaconda has no ability to disengage from the

04:37:53.120 --> 04:37:59.760
fight. Once the fight's on, it's got to go until the end. It has no ability to disengage and get

04:37:59.760 --> 04:38:09.440
away. Its only hope would be ambush. And it's got a tiny, tiny chance against a truly formidable

04:38:09.440 --> 04:38:16.560
animal. And the fact that if we look at actual concrete real world results, when Puma and Jaguar

04:38:16.560 --> 04:38:20.560
are kicking your ass, lion and bear, it's going to be a lot worse.

04:38:21.520 --> 04:38:27.840
Science is not to be found on YouTube, or rather YouTube is not science. I bet you there's a bear

04:38:28.560 --> 04:38:33.120
somewhere in Canada that has seen some shit. I'm just going to leave it at that.

04:38:35.520 --> 04:38:36.640
You're a fan of knives.

04:38:39.680 --> 04:38:47.920
There's guys like Miyamoto Musashi who, instead of doing who's number one type of tournaments,

04:38:48.640 --> 04:38:52.400
when both competitors walk away, only one competitor walks away.

04:38:53.520 --> 04:39:02.560
Miyamoto Musashi is known for somebody having John Donahue-like philosophical skills, but also

04:39:03.280 --> 04:39:12.240
is known for having fought 61 duels to the death and won them, obviously. What do you think made

04:39:12.240 --> 04:39:17.440
him so good? I don't feel qualified to talk about him because I haven't made an in-depth study of

04:39:17.440 --> 04:39:26.560
his life and times. And we also don't know how much truth there is to his recollections. And

04:39:26.560 --> 04:39:31.920
there's a lot of controversy over this. So I don't feel like you can give a definitive statement of,

04:39:33.200 --> 04:39:41.440
certainly I can't give a definitive statement of his prowess, but his writings are fascinating

04:39:41.440 --> 04:39:47.040
and deeply insightful. But as to what actually happened out there in his duels, it's unclear.

04:39:47.040 --> 04:39:52.560
But there is, you know, with guys like that, you almost certainly know that they were people

04:39:53.840 --> 04:40:00.960
like the character he projects that have existed, whether it's 61, whether it's 20. But people

04:40:00.960 --> 04:40:06.560
really put their life on the line in a different time in human history. Is there something compelling

04:40:06.560 --> 04:40:11.760
to you about fighting to the death? I think it's not just compelling to me, but to anyone. I mean,

04:40:11.760 --> 04:40:17.280
there's nothing we value more than our lives. And to be able to say, I'm prepared to die

04:40:18.160 --> 04:40:27.440
for a sense of honor, things that are so foreign to our modern society. Imagine we criticize people

04:40:27.440 --> 04:40:33.360
for something as simple as like road rage. And yet you can imagine someone who has a sufficiently

04:40:33.360 --> 04:40:38.560
developed sense of honor. If you took them out of the 17th century and put them in a modern car,

04:40:38.560 --> 04:40:43.680
they might be killing people on the side of the road on a regular basis, just over smaller stacks

04:40:43.680 --> 04:40:51.440
of honor. To say that your sense of self overwhelms your sense of self-preservation.

04:40:51.440 --> 04:40:55.680
It's a very unusual thing in the modern age, and yet it appears to have been quite common back then.

04:40:56.880 --> 04:41:01.920
You often wear a fanny pack. I'm not going to ask you what's inside the fanny pack,

04:41:01.920 --> 04:41:07.280
but if you were to design a perfect killing machine that also wore a fanny pack,

04:41:07.280 --> 04:41:14.800
what would you put in that fanny pack? Would it be something mundane and practical?

04:41:15.520 --> 04:41:24.800
Or would it be something surprising and hilarious? Would it be something of philosophical

04:41:24.800 --> 04:41:30.880
significance or maybe sentimental significance? Or would it be empty as a troll on human civilization?

04:41:30.880 --> 04:41:33.760
But if it was a perfect killing machine, it would have to be some kind of weapon.

04:41:33.760 --> 04:41:36.640
But in a fanny pack?

04:41:36.640 --> 04:41:40.320
It has to be a very compact weapon.

04:41:45.040 --> 04:41:48.880
We mentioned offline that there's also things in the chess world

04:41:49.520 --> 04:41:53.760
where there is a different kind of vibrating devices that could be used to

04:41:55.200 --> 04:42:00.720
communicate information in communication with AI systems that can help you in your particular

04:42:00.720 --> 04:42:06.960
pursuit. I don't think in jiu-jitsu it's possible for a machine to give you information that gives

04:42:06.960 --> 04:42:12.880
you advantage. You can in chess and in poker, so you could put one of those vibrating devices

04:42:12.880 --> 04:42:19.840
in your fanny pack, but in jiu-jitsu it would not help you. Any idea what kind of weapon?

04:42:21.040 --> 04:42:22.240
To fit in a fanny pack?

04:42:23.200 --> 04:42:26.480
You're a fan of knives. Where does the interest in knives come from, by the way?

04:42:26.480 --> 04:42:34.080
That's more metaphorical. The truth is in the modern world, a knife is not an efficient weapon.

04:42:34.720 --> 04:42:42.080
Easily be overwhelmed by firearms. My fascination with knives comes more in the sense that they

04:42:42.960 --> 04:42:52.400
convey a spirit to my students where a knife is made of steel and steel begins as ore in the ground.

04:42:53.040 --> 04:43:03.920
It's an ugly, unfinished product which, through the enactment of knowledge, time and discipline,

04:43:03.920 --> 04:43:12.480
can be transformed into beautiful shining steel. It begins as something which has no real function

04:43:12.480 --> 04:43:17.120
and becomes one of the most functional and important tools in all of human history without

04:43:17.120 --> 04:43:23.280
which human civilization could never have even begun. It's what separated humans and took us from

04:43:23.280 --> 04:43:28.080
the bottom of the food chain and began our gradual rise towards the top of the food chain.

04:43:28.080 --> 04:43:35.120
So it has immense historical and cultural value, but it has this metaphorical value in so far as

04:43:35.120 --> 04:43:41.280
the martial artist begins as a white belt like iron ore, but over time transforms into some

04:43:41.920 --> 04:43:46.320
beautiful shining steel which can have immense value.

04:43:48.960 --> 04:43:53.760
In addition, there's a sense of maintenance. As remarkable as steel is,

04:43:55.360 --> 04:44:01.920
it is in need of constant maintenance. It will fall apart through rust and neglect will destroy

04:44:01.920 --> 04:44:08.320
a blade, both in terms of rust and the edge falling apart. So just as the martial artist,

04:44:08.320 --> 04:44:12.640
it's not good enough just to learn the techniques. You need to maintain them over time.

04:44:13.600 --> 04:44:19.280
Just as steel is perishable, so too are the skills of martial arts. When I give a gift

04:44:19.280 --> 04:44:24.160
of a knife to a student, these metaphorical elements start to emerge. They say, okay,

04:44:24.160 --> 04:44:33.040
I began as iron ore and I want to become the finished blade. There's another sense in which

04:44:34.000 --> 04:44:42.640
a knife is morally neutral. A knife can be used to save a life. It can be used to cook a meal,

04:44:43.840 --> 04:44:47.200
but it can also be used for murder for the worst possible purposes.

04:44:49.200 --> 04:44:54.400
Juditsu is the same way. Juditsu can make you a better person. It can make you a worse person.

04:44:54.400 --> 04:45:00.480
Juditsu was just a power. It's not a particularly great power, but it is a power. And like all power,

04:45:00.560 --> 04:45:05.600
it can be used for both good and bad. It's morally neutral in itself. And it's up to us to make sure

04:45:05.600 --> 04:45:11.680
that just as the knife gets used for good purposes rather than bad, so too, the juditsu

04:45:11.680 --> 04:45:18.720
would be used for good purposes rather than bad. There's also an element where the basis of the

04:45:18.720 --> 04:45:25.680
knife is steel. And historically, there's always been a riddle of steel, which is

04:45:26.160 --> 04:45:33.200
steel has the property of both hardness and suppleness.

04:45:35.120 --> 04:45:42.240
The harder you make steel, the better its edge retention becomes. The longer that edge will stay

04:45:42.240 --> 04:45:48.880
sharp. This is good, but it comes at a price. The harder you make steel, the more brittle it becomes.

04:45:49.840 --> 04:45:53.280
And now that edge can be damaged easily.

04:45:56.400 --> 04:46:02.400
So the solution is to make the steel softer, more malleable. That will prevent breakage of the blade

04:46:02.400 --> 04:46:09.280
and chipping of the edge. But when you make the steel softer, that comes at a price. And that

04:46:09.280 --> 04:46:18.960
price is now the edge loses its sharpness very easily. And so the riddle of steel is how to

04:46:20.160 --> 04:46:26.800
work with these two to the greatest degree possible and create an edge which is hard enough to stay

04:46:26.800 --> 04:46:32.480
sharp for long periods of time, but without making the steel so brittle that the blade

04:46:32.480 --> 04:46:40.880
overall is compromised. So too in jiu-jitsu, your task in training is to make the training

04:46:40.880 --> 04:46:46.880
competitive enough that you actually get used to the rigors of real combat. But on the other hand,

04:46:46.880 --> 04:46:52.400
it can't be so brutal that the athletes get broken down in the gym to a point where they're

04:46:52.400 --> 04:46:59.840
no longer effective. And so this duality of hardness and softness, which we see in the case of

04:47:00.800 --> 04:47:07.520
blades, is there in the training of the jiu-jitsu athlete. So I often give a gift of a knife

04:47:08.320 --> 04:47:12.560
to a student when they've done something significant because it demonstrates in a

04:47:12.560 --> 04:47:20.560
metaphorical way these key themes of the sport. Well, I've been honored to be a student of yours.

04:47:20.560 --> 04:47:27.840
I've been plagued by injury, but I hope to one day earn one such knife. And I think that's a

04:47:27.840 --> 04:47:35.280
really powerful metaphor. I'm really honored that you would spend any time with me in any context,

04:47:35.280 --> 04:47:40.400
but especially on the mat and especially today in conversation, John, you're an incredible person.

04:47:40.400 --> 04:47:46.880
Thank you for everything you do. Congratulations for historic accomplishment. It's always beautiful

04:47:46.880 --> 04:47:54.720
and inspiring to see greatness. And what I saw, what we saw at ADCC was greatness, rare greatness.

04:47:54.720 --> 04:47:58.400
And it's beautiful to see that humans can achieve that kind of thing. So thank you for

04:47:59.200 --> 04:48:02.960
making that happen. And thank you for talking today. Thank you, Lex.

04:48:04.160 --> 04:48:08.640
Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Donahue. To support this podcast,

04:48:08.640 --> 04:48:14.400
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

04:48:14.400 --> 04:48:22.720
Miyamoto Musashi. The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight. And the only reason a warrior

04:48:22.720 --> 04:48:29.280
fights is to win. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
