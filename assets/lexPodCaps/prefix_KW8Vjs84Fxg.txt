WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.720
We think that self-assembly,

00:01.720 --> 00:04.760
this modular reconfigurable algorithm

00:04.760 --> 00:07.520
for constructing space structures in orbit

00:07.520 --> 00:10.760
is gonna give us this promise of space architecture

00:10.760 --> 00:12.320
that's actually worth living in.

00:12.320 --> 00:15.400
You see, you do believe we might one day become

00:15.400 --> 00:17.920
intergalactic civilization.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.060
I have a hope, yeah.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.240
The following is a conversation with Ariel Egblah,

00:24.240 --> 00:27.400
Director of MIT Space Exploration Initiative.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.240
She's especially interested in

00:29.240 --> 00:32.720
autonomously self-assembling space architectures.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.920
Basically, giant space structures

00:35.920 --> 00:37.760
that can sustain human life

00:37.760 --> 00:40.440
and that assemble themselves out in space

00:40.440 --> 00:45.440
and then orbit Earth, moon, Mars, and other planets.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.320
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.280
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:50.280 --> 00:51.520
in the description.

00:51.520 --> 00:55.440
And now, dear friends, here's Ariel Egblah.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.520
When did you first fall in love with space exploration

00:59.520 --> 01:01.240
and space in general?

01:01.240 --> 01:04.120
My parents are both ex-Air Force.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.860
So my dad's an A-10 fighter pilot

01:05.860 --> 01:09.680
and my mom trained and had qualified to be a fighter pilot,

01:09.680 --> 01:11.880
but it was early enough that women were not allowed

01:11.880 --> 01:13.380
in combat at that time.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.360
And so I grew up with these two pilots

01:16.360 --> 01:18.640
and although they themselves did not become astronauts,

01:18.640 --> 01:20.960
there's a really rich legacy of Air Force pilots

01:20.960 --> 01:24.280
becoming astronauts and this loomed large in my childhood.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.800
What does it mean to be courageous, to be an explorer,

01:26.800 --> 01:31.680
to be at the vanguard of something hard and challenging?

01:31.680 --> 01:32.920
And to couple with that,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.080
my dad was a huge fan of science fiction.

01:35.080 --> 01:39.600
And so I, as a kid, read Heinlein and Isaac Asimov,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.280
all these different classics of science fiction

01:41.280 --> 01:42.520
that he had introduced me to.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.920
And that just started a love affair with space exploration

01:45.920 --> 01:47.840
and really thinking about

01:47.840 --> 01:50.740
civilization-scale space exploration.

01:51.580 --> 01:56.580
So did they themselves dream about going to the stars

01:57.780 --> 02:01.060
as opposed to flying here in Earth's atmosphere,

02:01.060 --> 02:02.060
just looking up?

02:02.060 --> 02:04.140
Yeah, my dad always said he was absolutely convinced

02:04.140 --> 02:06.340
because he was a child of the Apollo years

02:06.340 --> 02:08.660
that he would get to go in his lifetime.

02:08.660 --> 02:10.020
Really thought it was gonna happen.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.820
And so it was a challenge and sad for many people

02:12.820 --> 02:15.260
when to their view on the outside,

02:15.260 --> 02:17.980
space exploration slowed down for a period of time.

02:17.980 --> 02:19.740
In reality, we were just catching up.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.140
I think we leapt so far ahead with Apollo

02:23.140 --> 02:25.300
more than the rest of society was ready for.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.660
And now we're coming back to this moment

02:27.660 --> 02:30.020
for space exploration where we actually have an economy

02:30.020 --> 02:32.820
and we have the other accoutrement that society needs

02:32.820 --> 02:35.020
to be able to make space exploration more real.

02:35.020 --> 02:37.380
And my dad's thrilled because finally,

02:37.380 --> 02:40.020
not nearly, I hope not anywhere near the end of his life,

02:40.020 --> 02:40.940
but as he's an older man,

02:40.940 --> 02:44.500
he now can see still within his lifetime,

02:44.500 --> 02:45.580
people really getting a chance

02:45.580 --> 02:47.940
to build a sustainable lunar settlement on the moon

02:47.940 --> 02:49.220
or maybe even go to Mars.

02:49.220 --> 02:52.180
So settlement, civilizations and other planets,

02:52.180 --> 02:55.660
that's the cool thing to dream about in the future.

02:55.660 --> 02:56.860
It certainly is.

02:56.860 --> 03:00.620
What was the favorite sci-fi authors when you were growing up?

03:00.620 --> 03:02.620
Pabbe Ezek Asimov, Foundation Trilogy.

03:02.620 --> 03:05.260
This is an amazing story of Harry Seldin,

03:05.260 --> 03:09.220
this foundation that he forms at different ends of the,

03:09.220 --> 03:10.900
well, according to the story,

03:10.900 --> 03:12.460
different ends of the universe

03:12.460 --> 03:16.860
and has this interesting focus on society.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.220
So it's not just space exploration

03:19.220 --> 03:21.500
for the sake of space exploration or novel technology,

03:21.500 --> 03:23.940
which is a lot of what I work on, data data MIT,

03:23.940 --> 03:26.940
but how do you structure a society

03:27.940 --> 03:31.540
across those vast expanses of distance and time?

03:31.540 --> 03:33.620
And so I'd say absolutely a favorite.

03:33.620 --> 03:38.020
Now though, my favorite is Neil Stevenson and Seven Eaves.

03:38.020 --> 03:40.620
It's a book that inspired my own PhD research

03:40.620 --> 03:43.100
and some ongoing work that we're doing with NASA now

03:43.100 --> 03:46.660
for the future of swarm robotics for spacecraft.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.700
We were saying offline about Neil Stevenson

03:49.700 --> 03:51.580
because I just recently had a conversation with him.

03:51.580 --> 03:52.940
And I said that, you know,

03:52.940 --> 03:54.660
not until I was doing the research for him

03:54.660 --> 03:59.660
that I realized he also had a role to play in Blue Origin.

03:59.860 --> 04:02.740
So it's like sci-fi actually having a role to play

04:02.740 --> 04:06.060
in the design, engineering,

04:06.060 --> 04:07.660
just the implementation of ideas

04:07.660 --> 04:10.860
that come kind of percolate up from the sci-fi world

04:10.860 --> 04:11.980
and actually become reality.

04:11.980 --> 04:14.500
It's kind of fascinating to figure in that way.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.700
So do you also think about him beyond just his work

04:18.700 --> 04:21.180
in science fiction, but his role in coming up

04:21.180 --> 04:24.180
with wild, crazy ideas that actually become reality?

04:24.180 --> 04:26.860
Yes, I think it's a great example of this cycle

04:26.860 --> 04:29.980
between authors and scientists and engineers

04:29.980 --> 04:32.100
that we can be inspired in one generation

04:32.100 --> 04:33.900
by what authors dream up.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.740
We build it, we make it a reality,

04:35.740 --> 04:37.420
and then that inspires another generation

04:37.420 --> 04:40.540
of really wild and crazy thought for science fiction.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.260
I think Neil Stevenson does a beautiful job

04:42.260 --> 04:44.740
of being what we would call a hard science fiction author.

04:44.740 --> 04:46.500
So it's really grounded in a lot of science,

04:46.500 --> 04:47.940
which makes it very compelling for me

04:47.940 --> 04:50.140
as a scientist and engineer to read

04:50.140 --> 04:53.260
and then be challenged to make that vision a reality.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.100
The other community that Neil's involved with

04:56.100 --> 04:57.620
and some of my other mentors are involved with

04:57.620 --> 04:59.940
that we are thinking about more and more

04:59.940 --> 05:04.180
in the work that we do at MIT is the Long Now Foundation

05:04.180 --> 05:08.860
and this focus on what does society need to take

05:08.860 --> 05:11.460
in terms of steps at this juncture,

05:11.460 --> 05:14.500
this particular inflection point in human history

05:14.500 --> 05:16.140
to make sure that we're setting ourselves up

05:16.140 --> 05:20.420
for a long and prosperous horizon, for humanities horizons.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.580
There's a lot of examples of what the Long Now Foundation

05:22.580 --> 05:23.860
does and thinks about.

05:23.860 --> 05:25.500
But when I think about this in my own work,

05:25.500 --> 05:30.500
it's what does it take to scale humanity's presence in orbit?

05:31.740 --> 05:34.180
We are seeing some additional investment

05:34.180 --> 05:36.300
in commercial space habitats.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.660
So it'll no longer be just NASA

05:37.660 --> 05:39.420
running the International Space Station,

05:39.420 --> 05:42.860
but to really democratize access to space to have,

05:42.860 --> 05:44.540
like Bezos wants to have millions of people

05:44.540 --> 05:46.020
living and working in space,

05:46.020 --> 05:49.460
you need architecture that's bigger and grander

05:49.460 --> 05:50.940
and can actually scale.

05:50.940 --> 05:52.100
That means you need to be thinking about

05:52.100 --> 05:55.140
how can you construct things for long time horizons

05:55.140 --> 05:56.740
that are really sustainable in orbit

05:56.740 --> 05:59.460
or on a surface of a celestial body

05:59.460 --> 06:02.180
that are bigger than the biggest rocket payload fairing

06:02.180 --> 06:03.460
that we currently have available.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.420
And that's what led me to self-assembly

06:05.420 --> 06:08.300
and other models of in-space construction.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.620
Okay, every time you speak,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.660
I get like a million tangent ideas, but let me-

06:12.660 --> 06:13.500
You can cut me off, keep it.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.180
No, no, no, no, no, please keep talking, this is amazing.

06:16.180 --> 06:19.140
I just, there's like a million of ideas.

06:19.140 --> 06:21.860
So one sort of on the dark side, let me ask,

06:21.860 --> 06:25.100
do you think about the threats to human civilization

06:25.100 --> 06:28.980
that kind of motivate the scaling of the expansion

06:28.980 --> 06:31.780
of humans in space and on other planets?

06:31.780 --> 06:32.940
What are you worried about?

06:32.940 --> 06:37.740
Nuclear war, pandemics, super intelligent,

06:37.740 --> 06:39.780
artificial intelligence systems,

06:40.900 --> 06:44.180
more not existential crises,

06:44.180 --> 06:46.420
but ones that have significant,

06:46.420 --> 06:48.820
potentially significant detrimental effects on society

06:48.820 --> 06:51.100
like climate change, those kinds of things.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.860
And then there's of course the fun asteroid

06:52.860 --> 06:55.460
coming out from the darkness and hitting all earth.

06:55.460 --> 06:57.100
There's been a few movies on that.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.300
Anyway, is there something that you think about

07:00.380 --> 07:02.340
that threatens us in this century?

07:03.220 --> 07:04.580
I mean, as an ex-military family,

07:04.580 --> 07:06.500
we used to talk about all of this.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.900
We would say that luck favors the prepared.

07:08.900 --> 07:12.620
And so growing up, we had a plan actually,

07:12.620 --> 07:14.540
a family plan for what we would do in a pandemic.

07:14.540 --> 07:15.620
Didn't think we were gonna have to put that

07:15.620 --> 07:17.580
and plan into place and here we are.

07:17.580 --> 07:20.300
We do certainly among my own family

07:20.300 --> 07:21.900
and my friends within our work at MIT,

07:21.900 --> 07:23.900
we do think about existential threats

07:23.900 --> 07:27.340
and risks to humanity and what role does space exploration

07:27.340 --> 07:29.260
and getting humans off world have to play

07:29.260 --> 07:32.180
in a resilient future for humanity.

07:32.180 --> 07:35.460
But what I actually find more compelling recently

07:35.460 --> 07:40.460
is instead of thinking about a need to ever abandon earth

07:40.580 --> 07:43.020
through a path of space exploration or space foraging,

07:43.020 --> 07:44.940
is to see how we can use space technology

07:44.940 --> 07:47.300
to keep earth livable.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.060
The obvious direct ways of doing this would be

07:50.060 --> 07:52.340
satellite technology that's helping us learn more

07:52.340 --> 07:56.300
about climate change or emitters or CO2.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.180
But there's also a future for geoengineering

07:58.180 --> 07:59.620
that might be space-based.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.900
A lot of questions that would have to be answered around that.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.340
But these are examples of pivoting our focus away

08:06.220 --> 08:07.620
from maybe the Hollywood vision of,

08:07.620 --> 08:08.780
oh, an asteroid's gonna come,

08:08.780 --> 08:10.020
we're all gonna have to escape earth

08:10.020 --> 08:15.020
to let's use our considerable technology prowess

08:15.100 --> 08:17.100
and use space technology to save earth

08:17.100 --> 08:18.780
and be very much focused on how can we have

08:18.780 --> 08:21.580
a worthwhile life for earth citizens,

08:21.580 --> 08:24.820
even as some of us wanna go out and further venturing.

08:24.820 --> 08:28.740
Right, just the desire to explore the mysterious, yes.

08:28.740 --> 08:32.140
But also it does seem that by placing us

08:32.140 --> 08:34.540
in harsh conditions, the harsh conditions of space,

08:34.540 --> 08:35.700
the harsh conditions of planets,

08:35.700 --> 08:38.060
and the biology, the chemistry, the engineering,

08:38.060 --> 08:41.580
the robotics, the materials, all of that,

08:41.580 --> 08:43.980
that's just a nice way to come up with cool new things.

08:43.980 --> 08:45.180
Great forcing function, yeah.

08:45.180 --> 08:46.300
Yeah, it's a forcing, exactly.

08:46.300 --> 08:49.020
It's a forcing function like survival.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.980
You don't get this right, you die.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.460
So, and that you can bring back to earth

08:53.460 --> 08:57.980
and it will improve, like figuring out food in space

08:57.980 --> 09:01.900
will make you figure out how to eat,

09:01.900 --> 09:04.140
live healthier lives here on earth.

09:04.140 --> 09:05.900
So true, I mean, some of the technologies

09:05.900 --> 09:08.700
that we're directly looking at right now

09:08.700 --> 09:12.060
for space habitats, it's hard to keep humans alive

09:12.060 --> 09:15.620
in this really fragile little pocket against the vacuum

09:15.620 --> 09:19.060
and all of the dangers that the space environment presents.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.900
Some of the technologies we are gonna have to figure out

09:20.900 --> 09:24.700
is energy efficient cooling and air conditioning,

09:25.540 --> 09:28.940
air filtration, scrubbing CO2 from the air,

09:28.940 --> 09:33.580
being able to have habitats that are themselves

09:33.580 --> 09:36.380
resilient to extremes of space weather and radiation.

09:36.380 --> 09:39.380
And some of these are direct translational opportunities

09:39.380 --> 09:41.780
for areas turned by natural disasters.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.180
People in California a decade ago

09:43.180 --> 09:45.900
would never have had to think about having an airtight house.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.820
But now with wildfires, maybe you do want something close

09:48.820 --> 09:50.420
to an airtight house.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.540
How do you manage that?

09:51.540 --> 09:54.420
There's a lot of technologies from the space habitation

09:54.420 --> 09:57.060
world that we are hoping we can actually bring back down

09:57.060 --> 09:58.700
to benefit life on earth as well

09:58.700 --> 10:01.260
in these extreme environment contexts.

10:01.260 --> 10:05.900
Okay, so you mentioned to go back to swarm.

10:05.900 --> 10:06.740
Yeah.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.660
So that was interesting to you, first of all,

10:09.660 --> 10:12.660
in your own work, but also I believe you said something

10:12.660 --> 10:14.940
that was inspiring from Neal Stephenson as well.

10:14.940 --> 10:19.940
So when you say swarm, are you thinking about architectures

10:23.300 --> 10:25.420
or are you thinking about artificial intelligence

10:25.420 --> 10:28.420
like robotics or are those kind of intermixed?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.220
I think the future that we're seeing

10:30.300 --> 10:31.780
is that they're going to be intermixed,

10:31.780 --> 10:33.180
which is really exciting.

10:33.180 --> 10:35.780
So the future space habitats are one

10:35.780 --> 10:39.980
of intelligent structures, maybe not all the way to how

10:39.980 --> 10:43.260
and the 2001 Space Odyssey reference that scares people

10:43.260 --> 10:45.860
about the habitat having a mind of its own.

10:45.860 --> 10:47.860
But certainly we're building systems now

10:47.860 --> 10:51.820
where the habitat has sensing technology

10:51.820 --> 10:56.420
that allows it to communicate its basic functions,

10:56.420 --> 10:58.380
maintaining life support for the astronauts,

10:58.380 --> 11:01.540
but could also communicate in symbiosis

11:01.540 --> 11:04.420
with these swarm robots that would be on the outside

11:04.420 --> 11:07.260
of the spacecraft, whether it's in a microgravity

11:07.260 --> 11:09.260
orbiting environment or on the surface.

11:09.260 --> 11:11.220
And these little robots, they crawl,

11:11.220 --> 11:13.380
just a la Neal Stephenson and Seven Eaves,

11:13.380 --> 11:15.500
they crawl along the outside of the spacecraft

11:15.500 --> 11:19.260
looking for micrometeorite punctures or gas leaks

11:19.260 --> 11:21.700
or other faults and defects.

11:21.700 --> 11:24.060
And right now we're just working on the diagnosis.

11:24.060 --> 11:27.300
So can the swarm with its collective intelligence

11:27.300 --> 11:30.260
act in symbiosis with the spacecraft and detect things?

11:30.260 --> 11:31.300
But in the future, we'd also love

11:31.300 --> 11:34.140
for these little micro robots to repair in situ

11:34.140 --> 11:37.660
and really be like ants living in a tree

11:37.660 --> 11:39.500
altogether connected to the spacecraft.

11:39.500 --> 11:44.300
Do you envision the system to be fully distributed

11:44.300 --> 11:48.660
and just like an ant colony, if one of them is damaged

11:48.660 --> 11:53.540
or whatever, loses control and all those kinds of things

11:54.260 --> 11:57.340
that doesn't affect the performance of the complete system

11:57.340 --> 11:58.940
or doesn't need to be centralized?

11:58.940 --> 12:01.140
This is more like almost a technical question.

12:01.140 --> 12:01.980
Do you think-

12:01.980 --> 12:03.020
Good architecture question.

12:03.020 --> 12:05.860
Right, from the ground up,

12:05.860 --> 12:08.820
it's so scary to go fully distributed.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.140
Yes.

12:10.140 --> 12:12.700
But it's also exceptionally powerful, right?

12:12.700 --> 12:15.860
Robust, resilient to the harsh conditions of space.

12:15.860 --> 12:20.860
Where do you, if you look into the next 10, 20, 100 years,

12:21.380 --> 12:23.460
starting from scratch,

12:23.460 --> 12:24.620
do you think we should be doing

12:24.620 --> 12:28.020
architecture-wise distributed systems?

12:28.020 --> 12:31.300
For space, yes, because it gives you this redundancy

12:31.300 --> 12:33.380
and safety profile that's really critical.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.140
So whether it's small swarm robots

12:35.140 --> 12:37.300
where it doesn't matter if you lose a few of them

12:37.300 --> 12:41.700
to habitats that instead of having a central

12:41.700 --> 12:44.660
monolithic habitat, you might actually be able

12:44.660 --> 12:49.060
to have a decentralized node of a space station

12:49.100 --> 12:50.980
so that you can kind of right out of Star Wars,

12:50.980 --> 12:53.300
you can shut a blast door if there's a fire

12:53.300 --> 12:55.100
or if there's a conflict in a certain area

12:55.100 --> 12:57.180
and you can move the humans and the crew

12:57.180 --> 12:59.820
into another decentralized node of the spacecraft.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.500
There's another idea out of Neil Stephenson's

13:01.500 --> 13:03.820
Seven Eves actually where these arklets,

13:03.820 --> 13:06.180
which were decentralized spacecraft that could form

13:06.180 --> 13:09.980
and dock little temporary space stations with each other

13:09.980 --> 13:12.140
and then separate and go off on their way

13:12.140 --> 13:15.900
and have a decentralized approach to living in space.

13:15.900 --> 13:19.100
So the self-assembly component of that too.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.780
So this is your PhD work and beyond.

13:21.780 --> 13:24.420
You explored autonomously self-assembling

13:24.420 --> 13:28.220
space architecture for future space tourist habitats

13:28.220 --> 13:31.420
and space stations in orbit around Earth, Moon and Mars.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.660
There's few things I personally find sexier

13:34.660 --> 13:39.660
than self-assembling space, autonomously self-assembling

13:39.900 --> 13:40.980
space architecture.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.740
In general, it doesn't even need to be space.

13:42.740 --> 13:46.100
The idea of self-assembling architectures

13:46.100 --> 13:48.420
is really interesting, like building a bridge

13:48.420 --> 13:51.580
or something like that through self-assembling materials.

13:51.580 --> 13:56.580
It feels like an incredibly efficient way to do it

13:57.340 --> 13:59.880
because optimization is built in.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.220
So you can build the most optimal structures

14:03.220 --> 14:08.220
given dynamic, uncertain changing conditions.

14:09.060 --> 14:11.380
So maybe can you talk about your PhD work,

14:11.380 --> 14:16.380
about this work, about TESS Array, what is it in general?

14:17.020 --> 14:19.420
Any cool stuff, because this is super cool.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.140
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

14:21.140 --> 14:23.700
So TESS Array is my PhD research.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.860
It's this idea that we could take tiles

14:26.860 --> 14:30.020
that construct a large structure like a buckyball.

14:30.020 --> 14:31.860
Yeah, this is exactly what we're looking at here,

14:31.860 --> 14:34.700
which is the tiles that are packed flat in a rocket.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.380
They're released to float in microgravity.

14:38.380 --> 14:41.220
Magnets, pretty powerful electropermanent magnets

14:41.220 --> 14:44.460
on their edges, draw them together for autonomous docking.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.100
So there's no human in the loop here,

14:46.100 --> 14:48.180
and there's no central agent coordinating,

14:48.180 --> 14:50.740
saying tile one, go to tile two.

14:50.740 --> 14:52.480
It's completely decentralized system.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.820
They find each other on their own.

14:54.820 --> 14:56.820
What we don't show in this video is what happens

14:56.820 --> 14:58.220
if there's an error, right?

14:58.220 --> 15:00.140
So what happens if they bond incorrectly?

15:00.140 --> 15:02.660
The tiles have sensing, so proximity sensing,

15:02.660 --> 15:04.780
magnetometer, other sensors that allow them

15:04.780 --> 15:07.900
to detect a good bond versus a bad bond,

15:07.900 --> 15:10.040
and pulse off and self-correct,

15:10.080 --> 15:12.720
which anybody who works in the field of self-assembly

15:12.720 --> 15:15.800
will tell you that error detection and correction,

15:15.800 --> 15:19.080
just like error detection in a DNA sequence

15:19.080 --> 15:21.920
or protein folding, is really important part of the system

15:21.920 --> 15:24.760
for that robustness, and so we've done a lot of work

15:24.760 --> 15:27.120
to engineer that ability for the tiles

15:27.120 --> 15:29.360
to be self-determining.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.880
They know whether they're forming the structure

15:30.880 --> 15:32.240
that they're supposed to form or not.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.440
They know if they're in a toxic relationship

15:34.440 --> 15:35.840
that they need to get out.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.760
Right, right, if they need to separate, exactly, yeah.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.560
All right, this is like so amazing,

15:40.560 --> 15:42.040
and for people who are just listening to this,

15:42.040 --> 15:45.240
yeah, there's, I mean, how large are these tiles?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.840
So the size that we use in the lab,

15:47.840 --> 15:49.200
they can really be any size,

15:49.200 --> 15:50.360
because we can scale them down

15:50.360 --> 15:51.920
to do testing in microgravity.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.080
So we sent tiles that were about three inches wide

15:55.080 --> 15:57.160
to the International Space Station a couple years ago

15:57.160 --> 16:00.180
to test the code, test the state machine,

16:00.180 --> 16:02.320
test the algorithm of self-assembly,

16:02.320 --> 16:03.560
but now we're actually building

16:03.560 --> 16:05.720
our first ever human-scale tiles.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.080
They're me human-sized, a little smaller

16:08.080 --> 16:09.760
than maybe your average human,

16:09.760 --> 16:14.080
but they're 2.5 feet on edge length.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.760
The larger scale that we would love to build in the future

16:16.760 --> 16:18.760
would actually be tiles that are big enough

16:18.760 --> 16:21.980
to form a buckyball, big open spherical volume,

16:21.980 --> 16:23.660
spherical approximation volume,

16:23.660 --> 16:27.260
that'd be about 10 meters in diameter, so 30 feet,

16:27.260 --> 16:30.400
which is much bigger and grander in terms of open space

16:30.400 --> 16:32.600
than any current module on the ISS.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.200
And one of the goals of this project was to say,

16:35.200 --> 16:38.840
what's the purpose of next-generation space architecture?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.680
Should it be something that really inspires

16:41.680 --> 16:44.840
and delights people when you float into that space?

16:44.840 --> 16:46.760
Can you get goosebumps in the way that you do

16:46.760 --> 16:48.780
when you walk into a really stunning piece

16:48.780 --> 16:50.200
of architecture on Earth?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.300
And so we think that self-assembly,

16:52.300 --> 16:55.320
this modular reconfigurable algorithm

16:55.320 --> 16:58.100
for constructing space structures in orbit

16:58.100 --> 17:01.320
is gonna give us this promise of space architecture

17:01.320 --> 17:03.480
that's actually worth living in.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.360
Oh, I thought you also meant

17:05.360 --> 17:07.320
from outside artistic perspective,

17:07.320 --> 17:09.640
when you see the whole thing, it's just-

17:09.640 --> 17:11.480
With the aesthetics of it, absolutely.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.440
You know, when you go into Vegas or something,

17:14.440 --> 17:16.480
whenever you go into a city

17:16.480 --> 17:19.360
and it over the hill appears in front of you,

17:19.360 --> 17:20.720
and I mean, there's something majestic

17:20.720 --> 17:25.280
about seeing, wow, humans created that.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.040
It gives you hope about if these a bunch of ants

17:28.040 --> 17:30.280
were able to figure out how to build skyscrapers

17:30.280 --> 17:31.440
that light up.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.000
And in general, the design of these tiles

17:34.000 --> 17:36.480
and the way you envision it are pretty scalable.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.480
Yes, and they're inspired by exactly

17:38.480 --> 17:39.600
what you mentioned a moment ago,

17:39.600 --> 17:43.000
which is we have these patterns of self-assembly on Earth,

17:43.000 --> 17:45.040
and there's a lot of fantastic MIT research

17:45.040 --> 17:46.520
that we're building this concept on.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.400
So like Daniela Roos at CSAIL and Pebbles

17:49.400 --> 17:53.900
taking the power of magnets to create units

17:53.900 --> 17:56.200
that are themselves interchangeable,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.660
this notion of programmable matter.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.580
And so we're interested in going really big with it

18:01.580 --> 18:05.340
to build big-scale space structures with programmable tiles,

18:05.340 --> 18:07.940
but there's also a really fascinating end of that

18:07.940 --> 18:08.940
on the other side of the spectrum,

18:08.940 --> 18:10.780
which is how small can you go

18:10.780 --> 18:12.860
with matter that's programmable and stacks

18:12.860 --> 18:14.900
and builds itself and creates a bridge

18:14.900 --> 18:16.860
or something in the future?

18:16.860 --> 18:19.500
What do you envision the thing would look like?

18:19.500 --> 18:22.260
Like when you imagine a thing far into the future

18:22.260 --> 18:25.860
where there's, so we're not even thinking about

18:25.860 --> 18:28.980
like small space, let's not call them small,

18:28.980 --> 18:30.780
but are currently sized space stations,

18:30.780 --> 18:32.940
but like something gigantic.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.220
What do you envision?

18:34.220 --> 18:36.620
Is this something with symmetry

18:36.620 --> 18:38.820
or is this something we can't even come up with yet?

18:38.820 --> 18:42.860
Is there beautiful structures that you imagine in your mind?

18:42.860 --> 18:45.700
I've got three candidates that I would love to build.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.660
If we're talking about monumental space architecture,

18:48.660 --> 18:51.700
one is what does a space cathedral look like?

18:51.700 --> 18:52.840
It can be a secular cathedral,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.420
doesn't necessarily have to be about religion,

18:54.420 --> 18:57.940
but that notion of long sight lines,

18:57.940 --> 19:01.220
inspiring, stunning architecture when you go in.

19:01.220 --> 19:03.100
And you can imagine floating,

19:03.100 --> 19:07.300
instead of being on the ground and only looking up in space,

19:07.300 --> 19:08.700
you could be in a central node

19:08.700 --> 19:10.700
and each direction you look at,

19:10.700 --> 19:14.060
all the cardinal directions are spires going off

19:14.060 --> 19:15.380
in a really large and long way.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.180
So that's concept number one.

19:17.180 --> 19:19.980
Number two would be something more organic

19:19.980 --> 19:21.780
that's not just geometric.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.420
So here, one of the ideas that we're working on at MIT

19:24.420 --> 19:27.580
in my lab is to say, could you,

19:27.580 --> 19:29.260
instead of the Tesserae model, right,

19:29.260 --> 19:31.900
which is self-assembling a shell,

19:31.900 --> 19:34.980
could you define a module that's a node,

19:34.980 --> 19:36.940
a small node that someone can live in,

19:36.940 --> 19:39.660
and you self-assemble a lot of those together,

19:39.660 --> 19:43.620
they're called plesiohedrons, like space-filling solids,

19:43.620 --> 19:45.540
and you dock a bunch of them together

19:45.540 --> 19:49.820
and you can create a really organic structure out of that.

19:49.860 --> 19:53.460
So this is the same way that muscles accrete to appear.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.580
You can have these nodes that dock together,

19:55.580 --> 19:57.660
and one shape that I would love to form out of this

19:57.660 --> 20:00.460
is something like a nautilus, a seashell,

20:00.460 --> 20:03.500
that beautiful, you know, Fibonacci spiral sequence

20:03.500 --> 20:04.940
that you get in that shape,

20:04.940 --> 20:06.180
which I think would be a stunning

20:06.180 --> 20:10.340
and fabulous aggregated space station.

20:10.340 --> 20:14.220
You said so many cool words, plesiohedron.

20:14.220 --> 20:15.060
Yeah, plesiohedron.

20:15.060 --> 20:18.260
So that's space-filling.

20:18.340 --> 20:21.020
Solid, the simplest thing to think of is like a cube.

20:21.020 --> 20:21.980
Oh, cube. A cube, right?

20:21.980 --> 20:23.620
So you can stack cubes together,

20:23.620 --> 20:25.380
and if you had an infinite number of cubes,

20:25.380 --> 20:27.140
you'd fill all that space.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.860
There's no gaps in between the cubes.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.340
They stack and fill space.

20:31.340 --> 20:34.660
Another plesiohedron is a truncated octahedron,

20:34.660 --> 20:36.420
and that's actually one of the candidate structures

20:36.420 --> 20:38.660
that we think would be great for space stations.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.020
What's the truncated part?

20:40.020 --> 20:42.580
Ah, so you cut off an octahedron,

20:42.580 --> 20:44.500
it actually has little pointy areas.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.260
You truncate certain sections of it,

20:46.260 --> 20:50.020
and you get surfaces that are on the structure

20:50.020 --> 20:52.820
that are cubes and I think hexagons.

20:52.820 --> 20:55.540
I have to remind myself exactly what the faces are.

20:55.540 --> 20:59.180
But overall, a truncated octahedron can be bonded

20:59.180 --> 21:00.700
to other truncated octahedrons,

21:00.700 --> 21:03.500
and just like a cube, it fills all the gaps

21:03.500 --> 21:04.860
as you build it out.

21:04.860 --> 21:07.700
So you can imagine two truncated octahedrons,

21:07.700 --> 21:09.180
they come together at an airlock,

21:09.180 --> 21:12.260
which is what we space people call doors in space,

21:12.260 --> 21:14.180
and you dock them on all sides,

21:14.180 --> 21:18.060
and you've basically created this decentralized network

21:18.060 --> 21:21.980
of space nodes that make a big space station,

21:21.980 --> 21:23.620
and once you have enough of them

21:23.620 --> 21:25.460
and you're growing with enough big units,

21:25.460 --> 21:28.020
you can do it in any macro shape you want.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.300
That's where the nautilus comes in,

21:29.300 --> 21:32.940
is could we design an organically inspired shape

21:32.940 --> 21:34.220
for a space station.

21:34.220 --> 21:36.820
Can I just say how awesome it is to hear you say

21:36.820 --> 21:38.700
we space people?

21:38.700 --> 21:41.220
I know you meant people that are doing research

21:41.220 --> 21:43.820
on space exploration, space technology,

21:43.900 --> 21:45.980
but it also made me think of a future,

21:45.980 --> 21:47.220
there's earth people,

21:49.140 --> 21:50.620
and there's those space people,

21:50.620 --> 21:51.460
and then there's the Mars people.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.420
I'd love to unite those two.

21:52.420 --> 21:54.180
Yeah, no, no, for sure, for sure,

21:54.180 --> 21:59.180
but it's like New Yorkers and Texans or something like that.

22:00.780 --> 22:03.580
Yeah, of course, you live for a time in New York

22:03.580 --> 22:05.220
and then you go up to Boston,

22:05.220 --> 22:07.140
but for a time you're the space people.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.380
Oh, I know those space people,

22:09.380 --> 22:11.220
they're kind of wild up there.

22:11.220 --> 22:12.580
Let's see how that dynamic evolves.

22:12.620 --> 22:14.740
Yeah, exactly, that's culture, culture forms,

22:14.740 --> 22:17.140
and I would love to see what kind of culture,

22:17.140 --> 22:21.180
once you have sort of more and more civilians.

22:21.180 --> 22:22.580
I mean, there's a human,

22:22.580 --> 22:24.540
I mean, I love psychology and sociology,

22:24.540 --> 22:27.620
and I'll maybe ask you about that too,

22:27.620 --> 22:29.660
which is like the dynamic between humans.

22:29.660 --> 22:31.780
You have to kind of start considering that

22:31.780 --> 22:34.220
and you start spending more and more time up in space

22:34.220 --> 22:36.820
and start sending civilians,

22:36.820 --> 22:39.220
start sending bigger and bigger groups of people,

22:39.300 --> 22:42.940
and then of course, the beautiful and the ugly emerges

22:42.940 --> 22:46.100
from the human nature

22:46.100 --> 22:49.260
that we haven't been able to escape up to this point.

22:49.260 --> 22:53.100
But when you say the plesiohedrons, these kinds of shapes,

22:53.100 --> 22:54.540
are they multifunctional?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.740
Like is the idea you'd be able to,

22:58.660 --> 23:02.260
humans cannot occupy them safely in some of them

23:02.260 --> 23:04.900
and some others have some other purposes?

23:04.900 --> 23:07.340
Exactly, one could be sleeping quarters,

23:07.340 --> 23:10.420
one could be a greenhouse or an agricultural unit,

23:10.420 --> 23:13.780
one could be a storage depot,

23:13.780 --> 23:16.460
essentially all of the different rooms or functions

23:16.460 --> 23:17.900
that you might need in a space station

23:17.900 --> 23:19.980
could be subdivided into these nodes

23:19.980 --> 23:22.260
and then stacked together.

23:22.260 --> 23:24.500
And one of the promises of both Tesserae,

23:24.500 --> 23:26.940
my original PhD research, which is these shells,

23:26.940 --> 23:29.540
and then this follow-on node concept,

23:29.540 --> 23:32.140
is that right now we build space stations

23:32.140 --> 23:33.820
and once they're built, they're done.

23:33.820 --> 23:36.300
You can't really change them profoundly,

23:36.300 --> 23:38.980
but the benefit of a modular self-assembling system

23:38.980 --> 23:40.980
is you can disassemble it,

23:40.980 --> 23:42.820
you can completely reconfigure it.

23:42.820 --> 23:44.260
So if your mission changes

23:44.260 --> 23:46.380
or the number of people in space that you wanna host,

23:46.380 --> 23:47.780
if you have a space conference happening

23:47.780 --> 23:48.900
like South by Southwest.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.140
I was thinking space party,

23:50.140 --> 23:52.500
but space conference is good too.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.660
Then maybe all of a sudden you want to change out

23:55.660 --> 23:58.740
what were window tiles yesterday, cupola tiles,

23:58.740 --> 24:00.500
and make them into a birthing port

24:00.500 --> 24:02.580
so that you can welcome five new spaceships

24:02.580 --> 24:04.300
to come and join you in space.

24:04.340 --> 24:06.500
That's what this promise of reconfigurable

24:06.500 --> 24:09.100
space architecture might allow us to explore.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.740
I've been hanging out with Grimes recently.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.260
I just feel like she belongs up in space.

24:13.260 --> 24:15.580
This is like design for artists, essentially.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.220
I imagine, I mean, this is what South by

24:18.220 --> 24:20.300
keeps introducing me to is there's like

24:20.300 --> 24:23.500
the weird and the beautiful people and like the artists,

24:23.500 --> 24:26.380
and it feels like there's a lot of opportunities

24:26.380 --> 24:28.820
for art and design.

24:28.820 --> 24:29.660
100%.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.540
It's like space is a combination of arts, design,

24:32.780 --> 24:34.140
and great engineering.

24:36.860 --> 24:39.820
It's safety critical with like the highest of stakes.

24:39.820 --> 24:41.780
So don't, you can't mess it up.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.700
And is this, first of all, you're talking about tiling.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.660
So Neal Stephenson is obsessed about tiling.

24:46.660 --> 24:48.820
I don't know if it's related to any of this,

24:48.820 --> 24:50.620
but he seems to be obsessed with like,

24:50.620 --> 24:51.700
how do you tile a space?

24:51.700 --> 24:55.100
That's like a geometric notion, like the tessellation.

24:55.100 --> 24:59.580
And it's, I mean, it's a beautiful idea for architecture

24:59.620 --> 25:03.500
that you can self-assemble these different shapes,

25:03.500 --> 25:07.540
and you can have probably some centralized guidance

25:07.540 --> 25:09.780
of the kind of thing you want to build,

25:09.780 --> 25:12.100
but they also kind of figure stuff out themselves

25:12.100 --> 25:13.620
in terms of the low level of details,

25:13.620 --> 25:18.620
in terms of the figuring out when everything fits just right

25:18.700 --> 25:23.140
for the OCD people, like, what's that subreddit?

25:23.140 --> 25:26.220
Pleasantly, it's like really fun, everything,

25:26.220 --> 25:27.900
they have like videos of everything is just pleasant

25:27.900 --> 25:29.620
when everything just fits perfectly.

25:29.620 --> 25:32.580
Very pleasing, all the tolerances come together.

25:32.580 --> 25:34.460
So they figure that out on themselves

25:34.460 --> 25:36.380
and the local robotics problem.

25:36.380 --> 25:38.060
But by the way, what's the Neal Rose Pebbles,

25:38.060 --> 25:39.260
what's the Pebbles project?

25:39.260 --> 25:43.060
The Pebbles project are little cubes that have EPMs in them,

25:43.060 --> 25:46.180
Electropermanent Magnets, and they can self-disassemble.

25:46.180 --> 25:48.420
So they'll turn off, and so you'll have this little structure

25:48.420 --> 25:51.740
that all of a sudden can flip the little Pebbles over

25:51.740 --> 25:54.620
and essentially just disaggregate.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.700
They have to make some pleasing sounds.

25:57.420 --> 26:01.420
And what that's gonna, so I'm supposed to talk to Danielle,

26:01.420 --> 26:03.700
so I'll probably spend an hour just discussing

26:03.700 --> 26:05.020
the sounds on the Pebbles.

26:05.020 --> 26:07.580
Okay, what were we talking about?

26:07.580 --> 26:11.020
So that's, because you mentioned two, I think.

26:11.020 --> 26:12.100
Right, my third one.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.260
Yeah, is there a third one?

26:13.260 --> 26:14.660
My third one is a ring world,

26:14.660 --> 26:17.340
just because every science fiction book ever

26:17.340 --> 26:19.860
that's worth anything has a ring world in it.

26:19.860 --> 26:21.860
And this is- Is it a donut?

26:21.860 --> 26:24.500
A donut, yeah, so a really big torus

26:24.540 --> 26:27.740
that could encircle a planet

26:27.740 --> 26:29.660
or encircle another celestial body,

26:29.660 --> 26:32.180
maybe an asteroid or a small moon.

26:32.180 --> 26:36.140
And the promise here is just the beauty

26:36.140 --> 26:39.940
of being able to have that geometry in orbit

26:39.940 --> 26:43.220
and all that surface area for solar panels and docking

26:43.220 --> 26:46.620
and essentially just all of what that enables

26:46.620 --> 26:48.980
to have a ring world at that scale in orbit.

26:48.980 --> 26:51.580
By the way, for the viewers, we're looking at figure 11.

26:51.580 --> 26:52.620
What paper is this from?

26:53.260 --> 26:57.340
Hexagonal tiling of a torus generated in Mathematica

26:57.340 --> 27:01.060
referencing code and approach from two citations.

27:01.060 --> 27:04.260
So we're looking at a tiled donut and I'm now hungry.

27:04.260 --> 27:06.940
So this is the, is this from your thesis or no?

27:06.940 --> 27:08.740
This is probably, I mean, this is in my thesis.

27:08.740 --> 27:10.580
This looks like it was one of my earlier papers.

27:10.580 --> 27:13.260
This was an approach to say, great,

27:13.260 --> 27:15.460
we've come up with this tessellation approach

27:15.460 --> 27:18.140
for a buckyball and we picked the buckyball

27:18.140 --> 27:21.340
because it is the most efficient surface area

27:21.340 --> 27:23.940
to volume shape and what's expensive in space,

27:23.940 --> 27:26.340
the surface area shipping up all that material.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.780
So we wanted something that would maximize the volume.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.820
But if we think about ring worlds and other shapes,

27:30.820 --> 27:34.060
we wanted to look at how do you tile a torus?

27:34.060 --> 27:36.420
And this is one example with hexagons

27:36.420 --> 27:39.140
to be able to say, could we take this same tesseray approach

27:39.140 --> 27:42.180
of self-assembling tiles and create other geometries?

27:42.180 --> 27:43.540
This is so freaking cool.

27:43.540 --> 27:44.380
That's awesome.

27:44.380 --> 27:48.420
So you mentioned microgravity and I saw,

27:48.420 --> 27:50.420
I believe that there's a picture of you

27:50.420 --> 27:52.060
floating in microgravity.

27:52.060 --> 27:53.780
When did you get to experience that?

27:53.780 --> 27:54.620
What was that like?

27:54.620 --> 27:57.540
Ah, so I've flown nine times on the,

27:57.540 --> 28:00.020
affectionately known as the vomit comet.

28:00.020 --> 28:02.740
It's the parabolic flight and essentially it does

28:02.740 --> 28:04.340
what you'd want a plane never to do.

28:04.340 --> 28:07.020
It pitches really steeply upwards at 45 degrees.

28:07.020 --> 28:07.860
Oh, that's a picture of you.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.580
Yeah, that's tesseray.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.340
That's super early in my PhD,

28:11.340 --> 28:12.820
some of just the passive tiles.

28:12.820 --> 28:14.300
Before we even put electronics in,

28:14.300 --> 28:17.140
we were just testing the magnet polarity

28:17.140 --> 28:20.900
and the essentially is it an energy favorable structure

28:20.900 --> 28:22.260
to self-assemble on its own.

28:22.260 --> 28:23.940
So we tweaked a lot of things between.

28:23.940 --> 28:25.940
Are we looking at a couple of them?

28:25.940 --> 28:27.220
Yeah, you're looking at a bunch of them there.

28:27.220 --> 28:28.940
It's almost 32 of them.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.660
Yeah, they're clumping.

28:31.660 --> 28:33.180
Can you comment on what's the difference

28:33.180 --> 28:35.900
between microgravity and zero gravity?

28:35.900 --> 28:36.740
Yes.

28:36.740 --> 28:37.980
Is that an important difference?

28:37.980 --> 28:38.820
It's important difference.

28:38.820 --> 28:41.580
There is no zero gravity.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.740
There's no nothing, there's in the universe,

28:43.740 --> 28:45.980
there is no such thing as zero gravity.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.220
So Newton's law of gravity tells us

28:48.220 --> 28:50.300
that there's always gravity attraction

28:50.300 --> 28:51.340
between any two objects.

28:51.340 --> 28:54.300
So zero G is a shorthand that some of us fall into using

28:54.300 --> 28:56.460
or is a little easier to communicate to the public.

28:56.460 --> 28:59.460
The accurate term is microgravity,

28:59.460 --> 29:02.060
where you are essentially floating, you're weightless,

29:02.060 --> 29:04.260
but generally in free fall.

29:04.260 --> 29:06.620
So on the parabolic flights, the vomit comet,

29:06.620 --> 29:09.300
you're in free fall at the end of the parabola.

29:09.300 --> 29:12.420
And in orbit around the earth when you're floating,

29:12.420 --> 29:14.380
you're also in free fall.

29:14.380 --> 29:15.220
What was it like?

29:15.900 --> 29:17.660
So affectionately called vomit comet,

29:17.660 --> 29:19.780
I'm sure there's a reason why it's called affectionately.

29:19.780 --> 29:21.060
So what's it like?

29:21.060 --> 29:25.340
What's your first time to both philosophically,

29:25.340 --> 29:28.860
spiritually and biologically, what's it like?

29:28.860 --> 29:30.300
It's profound.

29:30.300 --> 29:35.140
It is unlike anything else you will experience on earth,

29:35.140 --> 29:38.660
because it is this true feeling of weightlessness

29:38.660 --> 29:39.980
with no drag.

29:39.980 --> 29:41.660
So the closest experience you can think of

29:41.660 --> 29:43.020
would be floating in a pool,

29:43.020 --> 29:44.860
but you move slowly when you float in a pool

29:44.860 --> 29:46.540
and your motion is restricted.

29:46.540 --> 29:49.980
When you're floating, it's just you and your body flying,

29:49.980 --> 29:51.180
like in a dream.

29:52.180 --> 29:54.300
It takes the littlest amount of energy,

29:54.300 --> 29:56.460
like a finger tap against the wall of the plane

29:56.460 --> 29:58.500
to shoot all the way across the fuselage.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.460
Wow, and you can move at full speed.

30:00.460 --> 30:02.740
Like you can move your arms.

30:02.740 --> 30:03.580
Exactly.

30:03.580 --> 30:04.420
So your muscles work.

30:04.420 --> 30:05.500
There's no resistance.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.820
There's no resistance.

30:06.820 --> 30:09.980
They actually tell you to make a memory

30:09.980 --> 30:11.460
when you're on the plane,

30:11.460 --> 30:13.940
because it's such a fleeting experience for your body

30:13.940 --> 30:14.980
that even a few days later,

30:14.980 --> 30:17.820
you've already forgotten exactly what it felt like.

30:17.820 --> 30:20.140
It's so foreign to the human experience.

30:20.140 --> 30:22.540
They kind of suggest that you explicitly try

30:22.540 --> 30:24.420
to really form this into a memory

30:24.420 --> 30:25.700
and then you can do the replay.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.540
Is that for training?

30:26.540 --> 30:27.740
Cognitively freeze it.

30:27.740 --> 30:28.580
Yeah.

30:28.580 --> 30:29.420
Cognitively freeze it.

30:29.420 --> 30:30.260
Yeah.

30:30.260 --> 30:31.100
Save.

30:31.100 --> 30:35.020
When we have Neuralink, we can replay that memory.

30:35.020 --> 30:38.220
So in terms of how much stress it has on your body,

30:38.220 --> 30:41.220
is it biologically stressful?

30:41.220 --> 30:43.620
You do feel a 2G pullout, right?

30:43.620 --> 30:46.500
So the cost of getting those micro-G parabolas

30:46.500 --> 30:48.300
is you then have a 2G pullout.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.140
And that's hard.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.220
You have to train for it.

30:50.220 --> 30:52.660
If you move your neck too quickly in that 2G pullout,

30:52.660 --> 30:54.820
you can strain muscles.

30:54.820 --> 30:59.060
But I wouldn't say that it's actually a profound,

30:59.060 --> 31:00.220
tough thing on the body.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.980
It's really just an incredibly novel experience.

31:02.980 --> 31:04.540
And when you're in orbit

31:04.540 --> 31:06.660
and you're not having to go through the ups and downs

31:06.660 --> 31:07.860
of the parabolic plane,

31:07.860 --> 31:09.940
there's a real grace and elegance.

31:09.940 --> 31:12.500
And you see the astronauts learn to operate

31:12.500 --> 31:15.020
in this completely new environment.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.420
What are some interesting differences

31:16.420 --> 31:17.820
between the parabolic plane

31:17.820 --> 31:19.980
and when you're actually going up in orbit?

31:19.980 --> 31:24.100
Is it that with orbit you can look out and see

31:24.100 --> 31:26.220
that blue little planet of ours?

31:26.220 --> 31:28.820
You can see the blue marble, the stunning overview effect,

31:28.820 --> 31:30.940
which is something I hope to see one day.

31:31.940 --> 31:34.220
What's also really different is if you're in orbit

31:34.220 --> 31:36.060
for any significant period of time,

31:36.060 --> 31:38.220
there's gonna be a lot more physiological changes

31:38.220 --> 31:41.500
to your body than if you just did an afternoon flight

31:41.500 --> 31:42.860
on the Vomit Comet.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.940
Everything from your bones, your muscles,

31:44.940 --> 31:47.500
your eyeballs change shape.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.020
There's a lot of different things that happen

31:49.020 --> 31:51.100
for long duration space flight.

31:51.100 --> 31:52.500
And we still have to, as scientists,

31:52.500 --> 31:54.500
we still have to solve a lot of these interesting challenges

31:54.500 --> 31:58.380
to be able to keep humans thriving in microgravity

31:58.380 --> 32:00.140
or deep duration space missions.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.580
Deep duration space missions.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.100
Okay, let's talk about this.

32:06.140 --> 32:08.220
I was just gonna ask a bunch of dumb questions.

32:08.220 --> 32:11.660
So approximately, how long does it take to travel to Mars?

32:11.660 --> 32:12.660
Asking for a friend.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.860
Asking for a friend, as we all do.

32:14.860 --> 32:17.860
About three years for a round trip.

32:17.860 --> 32:19.220
And that's not that it actually takes that long.

32:19.220 --> 32:20.260
Why the round trip?

32:20.260 --> 32:23.820
Is that, the friend was asking about the one way trip.

32:23.820 --> 32:25.060
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

32:25.060 --> 32:25.900
That's okay, cool.

32:25.900 --> 32:29.500
So for just like literally flying to Mars and around,

32:29.500 --> 32:30.780
it takes three years.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.580
There's some interstitial time there

32:32.580 --> 32:35.500
because you really can only go between Earth and Mars

32:35.500 --> 32:37.580
at certain points in their orbits

32:37.580 --> 32:39.500
where it's favorable to make that journey.

32:39.500 --> 32:40.900
And so part of that three years

32:40.900 --> 32:43.540
is you take the journey to Mars a few months,

32:43.540 --> 32:45.020
six to nine months.

32:45.020 --> 32:46.420
You're there for a period of time

32:46.420 --> 32:49.900
until the orbits find a favorable alignment again.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.940
And then you come back another six to nine months.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.180
So one way travel, six to nine months.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.420
They hang out there on vacation and then come back.

32:56.420 --> 32:57.420
Forced vacation.

32:57.420 --> 32:58.260
Forced vacation.

32:58.260 --> 32:59.100
You come back.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.980
Well, me who loves working all the time,

33:00.980 --> 33:03.300
all vacation is forced vacation.

33:03.300 --> 33:04.660
All right.

33:05.180 --> 33:07.820
Okay, so that gives us a sense of duration

33:07.820 --> 33:09.900
and we can maybe also talk about

33:09.900 --> 33:13.620
longer and longer and longer duration as well.

33:13.620 --> 33:17.300
What are the hardest aspects of this,

33:17.300 --> 33:20.820
of living in space for many days?

33:20.820 --> 33:23.340
For let's say 100 days, 200 days,

33:23.340 --> 33:25.940
maybe there's a threshold when it gets really tough.

33:25.940 --> 33:29.820
What are some stupid little things or big things

33:29.820 --> 33:32.380
that are very difficult for human beings to go through?

33:32.380 --> 33:33.940
So one big thing and one little thing.

33:34.020 --> 33:36.180
There's two classic problems that we're trying to solve

33:36.180 --> 33:37.260
in the space industry.

33:37.260 --> 33:38.820
One is radiation.

33:38.820 --> 33:40.940
It's not as much of a problem for us right now

33:40.940 --> 33:42.300
on the International Space Station

33:42.300 --> 33:44.100
because we're still protected

33:44.100 --> 33:46.140
by part of Earth's magnetosphere.

33:46.140 --> 33:47.980
But as soon as you get farther out into space

33:47.980 --> 33:49.340
and you don't have that protection

33:49.340 --> 33:52.700
once you leave the Van Allen belt area of the Earth

33:52.700 --> 33:55.380
and the cocoon around the Earth,

33:55.380 --> 33:57.940
we have really serious concerns about radiation

33:57.940 --> 33:59.860
and the effect on human health long-term.

33:59.860 --> 34:01.300
That's the big one.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.900
The small one, and I say it's small

34:02.900 --> 34:04.300
because it seems mundane,

34:04.300 --> 34:05.980
but it actually is really big in its own way

34:05.980 --> 34:09.060
is mental health and how to keep people happy and balanced.

34:09.060 --> 34:11.460
And you were alluding to some of the psychological challenges

34:11.460 --> 34:13.940
of having humans together on missions,

34:13.940 --> 34:16.140
and especially as we try to scale the number of humans

34:16.140 --> 34:18.140
in orbit or in space.

34:18.140 --> 34:19.380
So that's another big challenge

34:19.380 --> 34:22.820
is how to keep people happy and balanced and cooperating.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.900
That's not an issue on Earth at all.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.180
At all.

34:27.180 --> 34:29.460
Okay, so we'll talk about each of those

34:29.460 --> 34:31.140
in a bit more detail.

34:31.140 --> 34:34.460
But let me continue on the chain of dumb questions.

34:34.460 --> 34:35.700
What about food?

34:35.700 --> 34:38.820
What's a good source for food in space?

34:38.820 --> 34:42.700
And what are some sort of standard go-to meals, menus?

34:42.700 --> 34:46.060
Right now, your go-to menu is gonna be mostly freeze-dried.

34:46.060 --> 34:50.380
Every so often, NASA will arrange for a fun stunt

34:50.380 --> 34:51.900
or fresh food to get up to station.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.540
So they did bake double-tree cookies with Hilton

34:54.540 --> 34:55.820
a couple of years ago, as I recall,

34:55.820 --> 34:57.820
I think sometime before the pandemic.

34:57.820 --> 35:00.140
But there's work actually in our lab at MIT,

35:00.180 --> 35:02.180
Maggie Koblenz, one of my staff researchers,

35:02.180 --> 35:04.620
is looking at the future of fermentation.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.140
Everybody loves beer, right?

35:06.140 --> 35:08.740
Beer and wine and kimchi and miso,

35:08.740 --> 35:11.900
these foods that have just been really important

35:11.900 --> 35:13.260
to human cultures for eons

35:13.260 --> 35:16.580
because we love the umami and the better flavor in them.

35:16.580 --> 35:18.460
But it turns out they also have a good shelf life

35:18.460 --> 35:19.740
if done properly.

35:19.740 --> 35:22.500
And they also have an additional health benefit

35:22.500 --> 35:25.700
for the microbiome, for probiotics and prebiotics.

35:25.700 --> 35:27.660
So we're trying to work with NASA

35:27.660 --> 35:29.340
and convince them to be more open-minded

35:29.340 --> 35:33.140
to fermented food for long-duration deep space missions.

35:33.140 --> 35:35.180
That, we think, is one of the future elements

35:35.180 --> 35:38.580
in addition to in situ growing your own food.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.460
Okay, this is essential for the space party

35:41.460 --> 35:43.340
is the space beer.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.780
Yes, it's the fermented product, yes.

35:45.780 --> 35:46.740
Okay, cool.

35:46.740 --> 35:47.580
In terms of water,

35:47.580 --> 35:49.700
what's a good source of drinkable water?

35:49.700 --> 35:50.700
Like, where do you get water?

35:50.700 --> 35:52.900
Do you have to always bring it on board with you?

35:52.900 --> 35:56.700
And is there a compressed, efficient way of storing it?

35:56.700 --> 35:58.900
So to steal a line from Charlie Bolden,

35:58.900 --> 36:01.420
who's the former administrator of NASA,

36:01.420 --> 36:04.620
this morning's fresh water is yesterday's coffee.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.420
So if you think about what that means,

36:06.420 --> 36:08.140
you drank the coffee yesterday.

36:08.140 --> 36:09.460
Right, as a challenge.

36:09.460 --> 36:10.860
It goes fully through the body.

36:10.860 --> 36:13.100
Fully through the body as the recycling system.

36:13.100 --> 36:17.580
And then you drink what you peed out as, you know,

36:17.580 --> 36:21.420
clarified, refined fresh water the next day.

36:21.420 --> 36:23.340
That is one source of water.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.420
Another source of water in the near neighborhood

36:25.420 --> 36:27.140
of our solar system would be on the moon.

36:27.140 --> 36:28.380
So water ice deposits.

36:28.380 --> 36:30.060
There's also water on Mars.

36:30.060 --> 36:32.780
This is one of the big things that's bringing people

36:32.780 --> 36:35.300
to want to develop infrastructure on the moon,

36:35.300 --> 36:37.900
is once you've gotten out of the gravity well of earth,

36:37.900 --> 36:40.420
if you can find water on the moon and refine it,

36:40.420 --> 36:41.980
you can either make it into propellant

36:41.980 --> 36:44.220
or drinkable water for humans.

36:44.220 --> 36:47.220
And so that's really valuable as a potential gateway

36:47.220 --> 36:48.660
out into the rest of the solar system

36:48.660 --> 36:49.940
to be able to get propellant

36:49.940 --> 36:52.260
without always having to ship it up from earth.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.340
So how much water is there on Mars?

36:56.340 --> 36:57.180
That's a great question.

36:57.180 --> 36:58.020
I do not know.

36:58.580 --> 36:59.900
Water at the caps.

36:59.900 --> 37:04.260
I suspect NASA from all of the satellite studies

37:04.260 --> 37:06.780
that they've done at Mars have a decent idea

37:06.780 --> 37:08.580
of what the water deposits look like,

37:08.580 --> 37:09.660
but I don't know to what degree

37:09.660 --> 37:11.540
they have characterized those.

37:11.540 --> 37:14.060
I really hope there's life or traces

37:14.060 --> 37:16.820
of previous life on Mars.

37:16.820 --> 37:18.740
This is a special spot in my heart

37:18.740 --> 37:21.020
because I got to work on Sherlock,

37:21.020 --> 37:23.260
which is the astrobiology experiment

37:23.260 --> 37:24.740
that's on Mars right now,

37:24.740 --> 37:27.580
searching for what they would say in a very cautious way

37:28.140 --> 37:31.100
is signs of past habitability.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.300
They wanna be careful not to get people overly excited

37:33.300 --> 37:35.180
and say we're searching for signs of life.

37:35.180 --> 37:38.540
They're searching to see if there would have been organics

37:38.540 --> 37:40.900
on the surface of Mars or water in certain areas

37:40.900 --> 37:43.740
that would have allowed for life to flourish.

37:43.740 --> 37:45.740
And I really love this prospect.

37:45.740 --> 37:47.540
I do think within our lifetimes,

37:47.540 --> 37:50.380
we'll get a better answer about finding life

37:50.380 --> 37:52.420
in our solar system if it's there,

37:52.420 --> 37:55.940
if not on Mars, maybe Europa, one of the icy worlds.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.300
So you like astrobiology.

37:59.300 --> 38:00.140
I do.

38:00.140 --> 38:01.380
This is part of the,

38:01.380 --> 38:03.580
so it's not just about human biology,

38:03.580 --> 38:06.660
it's also other extraterrestrial alien biology.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.500
Search for life in the universe.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.540
Okay, does that scare you or excite you?

38:10.540 --> 38:12.180
It excites me, profoundly excites me.

38:12.180 --> 38:14.540
That there's other alien civilizations

38:14.540 --> 38:16.820
potentially very different than our own?

38:16.820 --> 38:18.660
I think there's gotta be some humility there.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.900
And certainly from science fiction,

38:19.900 --> 38:23.260
we have plenty of reasons to fear that outcome as well.

38:23.260 --> 38:24.620
But I do think as a scientist,

38:24.620 --> 38:27.260
it would be profoundly exciting if we were to find life,

38:27.260 --> 38:30.100
especially in the near neighborhood of our solar system.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.380
Right now, we would expect it to be

38:31.380 --> 38:33.140
most likely microbial life,

38:33.140 --> 38:35.420
but we have a real serious challenge in astrobiology,

38:35.420 --> 38:38.460
which is it may not even be carbon-based life.

38:38.460 --> 38:39.740
And all of our detectors,

38:39.740 --> 38:42.700
we only know to look for DNA or RNA.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.420
How would you even build a detector

38:44.420 --> 38:48.940
to look for silicon-based life or different molecules

38:48.940 --> 38:51.940
than what we know to be the fundamental molecules for life?

38:51.940 --> 38:53.900
And then you mentioned offline Sarah Walker.

38:54.740 --> 38:56.940
The question that she's obsessed with

38:56.940 --> 38:58.860
is even just defining life.

38:58.860 --> 39:02.580
What is life to look outside the carbon base?

39:02.580 --> 39:04.940
I mean, to look outside of basically anything

39:04.940 --> 39:07.300
we can even imagine chemically,

39:07.300 --> 39:08.860
to look outside of any kind of notions

39:08.860 --> 39:10.780
that we think of as biology.

39:10.780 --> 39:12.260
Yeah, it's really weird.

39:12.260 --> 39:14.940
So you now get into this land of like complexity

39:14.940 --> 39:19.940
of a measuring of like how many assembly steps

39:21.100 --> 39:23.060
it takes to build that thing.

39:23.780 --> 39:28.220
And maybe dynamic movement or some maintenance

39:28.220 --> 39:30.300
of some kind of membrane structures.

39:30.300 --> 39:31.780
Like we don't even know

39:31.780 --> 39:34.540
like which properties life should have,

39:34.540 --> 39:36.780
whether it should be able to reproduce

39:36.780 --> 39:37.820
and all those kinds of things,

39:37.820 --> 39:41.740
or pass information, genetic type of information.

39:41.740 --> 39:42.560
We don't know.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.180
And it's so humbling.

39:45.180 --> 39:47.700
I mean, I tend to believe that there could be

39:48.540 --> 39:51.100
something like alien life here on earth,

39:51.140 --> 39:54.660
and we're just too human biology obsessed

39:54.660 --> 39:56.020
to even recognize it.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.180
The shadow biosphere,

39:57.180 --> 39:58.980
I remember you and Sarah were talking about.

39:58.980 --> 40:02.260
I mean, that's like, speaking of beer,

40:02.260 --> 40:04.420
I mean, that's something I wanted to make sure

40:04.420 --> 40:07.260
in all of science to shake ourselves out of like,

40:07.260 --> 40:10.180
remind ourselves constantly how little we know.

40:10.180 --> 40:13.140
Cause it might be right in front of our nose.

40:13.140 --> 40:15.940
Like I wouldn't be surprised if like trees

40:15.940 --> 40:18.900
are like orders of magnitude more intelligent than humans.

40:18.940 --> 40:21.340
They're just operating in a much slower scale.

40:21.340 --> 40:23.860
And they're like talking shit about us the whole time.

40:23.860 --> 40:26.660
Like about silly humans that take everything seriously.

40:26.660 --> 40:28.660
And we'd start all kinds of nuclear wars

40:28.660 --> 40:31.140
and we quarrel and we tweet about it.

40:31.140 --> 40:33.500
And then, but the trees are always there,

40:33.500 --> 40:35.420
just watching us silly humans.

40:35.420 --> 40:37.100
Like the ants in Lord of the Rings.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.260
Exactly.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.700
So, I mean, I don't know.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.380
I mean, obviously I'm joking on that one,

40:41.380 --> 40:43.180
but there could be stuff like that.

40:44.220 --> 40:46.780
Well, let me ask you the Drake equation,

40:46.780 --> 40:48.300
the big question.

40:48.300 --> 40:51.100
How many, like, obviously nobody knows,

40:51.100 --> 40:53.380
but what's your gut, what's your hope

40:53.380 --> 40:55.020
as a scientist, as a human?

40:55.020 --> 40:57.180
How many alien civilizations are out there?

40:58.580 --> 41:01.340
As a ex-physicist, I'm now much more

41:01.340 --> 41:03.580
on the aerospace engineering side for space architecture,

41:03.580 --> 41:08.580
but as an ex-physicist, I hope it is prolific.

41:08.740 --> 41:10.700
I think the challenge is if it's as prolific

41:10.700 --> 41:13.740
as we would hope, if there are many, many, many civilizations,

41:13.740 --> 41:16.940
then the question is, where are they?

41:16.940 --> 41:18.780
Why haven't we heard from them?

41:18.780 --> 41:21.820
And the Fermi paradox, is there some great filter

41:21.820 --> 41:25.540
that life only gets to some level of sophistication

41:25.540 --> 41:29.220
and then kills itself off through war or through famine

41:29.220 --> 41:30.860
or through different challenges that filter

41:30.860 --> 41:33.820
that society out of existence?

41:33.820 --> 41:34.900
And it would be an interesting question

41:34.900 --> 41:38.100
to try to understand if the universe was teeming with life,

41:38.100 --> 41:41.060
why haven't we found it or heard from it yet,

41:41.060 --> 41:41.900
to our knowledge?

41:41.980 --> 41:44.940
Yeah, I personally believe that it's teeming with life,

41:44.940 --> 41:46.980
and you're right, I think that's a really useful

41:46.980 --> 41:49.540
productive engineering scientific question

41:49.540 --> 41:53.580
of what kind of great filter can just be destroying

41:53.580 --> 41:57.420
all of that life or preventing it from just constantly

41:57.420 --> 42:01.620
talking to us silly descendants of apes.

42:01.620 --> 42:05.460
That's a really nice question, like what are the ways

42:05.460 --> 42:07.780
civilizations can destroy themselves?

42:09.060 --> 42:10.740
There's too many, sadly.

42:10.740 --> 42:13.700
Well, I don't think we've come up with most of them yet.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.620
That's also probably true.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.620
That's the thing, it's, I mean, and like,

42:18.620 --> 42:21.900
if you look at nuclear war, some of it is physics,

42:21.900 --> 42:26.220
but some of it is game theory, it's human nature,

42:26.220 --> 42:29.540
it's how societies built themselves, how they interact,

42:29.540 --> 42:32.580
how we create and resolve conflict,

42:32.580 --> 42:34.660
and it gets back to the human question

42:34.660 --> 42:37.140
on when you're doing long-term space travel,

42:37.180 --> 42:40.380
how do you maintain this dynamical system

42:40.380 --> 42:45.380
of flawed, irrational humans such that it persists

42:46.660 --> 42:50.180
throughout time, to not just maintain the biological body,

42:50.180 --> 42:52.700
but get people from not murdering each other.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.980
Like, like each other sufficiently

42:54.980 --> 42:59.340
to where you kind of fit well, but I think, you know,

42:59.340 --> 43:02.500
if songs or poetry or books taught me anything,

43:02.500 --> 43:04.660
if you like each other a little too much,

43:05.620 --> 43:07.060
I mean, the problems arise,

43:07.060 --> 43:09.100
because then there's always a third person who also likes,

43:09.100 --> 43:10.660
and then there's the drama, it's like,

43:10.660 --> 43:13.420
I can't believe you did that, and then last night, whatever.

43:13.420 --> 43:14.620
So, and then there's beer.

43:14.620 --> 43:15.460
Gets complicated quickly.

43:15.460 --> 43:17.020
Gets complicated quickly.

43:17.020 --> 43:20.100
Okay, anyway, back to the dumb questions,

43:20.100 --> 43:22.820
because you answered this, there's an interview

43:22.820 --> 43:24.380
where you answer a bunch of cool little questions

43:24.380 --> 43:28.180
from young students and so on, about like space.

43:29.420 --> 43:32.220
One of them was playing music in space.

43:32.220 --> 43:33.060
Yeah.

43:33.260 --> 43:37.100
And you mentioned something about what kind of instruments

43:37.100 --> 43:39.500
you could use to play music in space.

43:39.500 --> 43:43.140
Could you mention about like the Spotify work in space,

43:43.140 --> 43:45.140
and if I wanted to do a live performance,

43:45.140 --> 43:47.820
what kind of instruments would I need?

43:47.820 --> 43:50.300
Yeah, I mean, you referenced culture before,

43:50.300 --> 43:51.980
and I think this is one of the most exciting things

43:51.980 --> 43:53.900
that we have at our fingertips,

43:53.900 --> 43:57.780
which is to define a new culture for space exploration.

43:57.780 --> 44:01.620
We don't just have to import cultural artifacts from Earth

44:01.660 --> 44:03.540
to make life worth living in space,

44:03.540 --> 44:05.180
and this musical instrument that you referenced

44:05.180 --> 44:06.780
was a design of an object

44:06.780 --> 44:09.540
that could only be performed in microgravity.

44:09.540 --> 44:10.380
Oh, cool.

44:10.380 --> 44:12.260
So it doesn't sound the same way

44:12.260 --> 44:14.260
when it's a percussive instrument,

44:14.260 --> 44:16.820
when it's rattled or moved in a gravity environment.

44:16.820 --> 44:17.660
It's unique.

44:17.660 --> 44:18.500
Can we look it up?

44:18.500 --> 44:19.540
It's called the Telematron.

44:19.540 --> 44:20.380
Yeah, it's created by-

44:20.380 --> 44:22.420
Of course it's called the Telematron.

44:22.420 --> 44:23.580
That is so awesome.

44:23.580 --> 44:25.820
Created by Sans Fish and Nicole Houllier,

44:25.820 --> 44:27.620
two amazing graduate students

44:27.620 --> 44:29.500
and staff researchers on my team.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.340
What does it look like?

44:31.100 --> 44:33.180
It looks steampunk, actually.

44:33.180 --> 44:34.020
That's awesome.

44:34.020 --> 44:35.100
Yeah, it's a pretty cool design.

44:35.100 --> 44:37.300
It looks like it's a geometric solid

44:37.300 --> 44:39.860
that has these interesting artifacts on the inside,

44:39.860 --> 44:41.260
and it has a lot of sensors, actually,

44:41.260 --> 44:42.220
additionally on the inside,

44:42.220 --> 44:44.980
like IMU's, inertial measurement sensors,

44:44.980 --> 44:47.780
that allow it to detect when it's floating

44:47.780 --> 44:49.140
and when it's not floating,

44:49.140 --> 44:52.500
and provides this really kind of ethereal,

44:52.500 --> 44:53.580
they later sonify it,

44:53.580 --> 44:56.220
so they use electronic music to turn it into a symphony

44:56.220 --> 44:57.780
or turn it into a piece.

44:57.780 --> 44:59.580
And yeah, this is the object, the Telematron.

44:59.620 --> 45:01.420
How does the human interact with it?

45:01.420 --> 45:02.260
By tossing it.

45:02.260 --> 45:04.060
So it's an interactive musical instrument.

45:04.060 --> 45:06.460
It actually requires another partner.

45:06.460 --> 45:09.460
So the idea was that it's something like a dance,

45:09.460 --> 45:12.060
or just something like a choreography in space.

45:12.060 --> 45:12.900
Got it.

45:12.900 --> 45:13.740
And then, speaking of which,

45:13.740 --> 45:15.900
you also talked about sports,

45:15.900 --> 45:18.460
and ball sports, like playing soccer.

45:18.460 --> 45:23.460
So you mentioned that your muscles can move at full speed,

45:23.900 --> 45:26.540
and then if you push off the wall lightly,

45:26.540 --> 45:27.860
you fly across- Zoom.

45:27.860 --> 45:28.740
Zoom across.

45:28.740 --> 45:31.500
So how does the physics of that work?

45:31.500 --> 45:34.580
Can you still play soccer, for example, in space?

45:34.580 --> 45:37.380
You can, but one of the most intuitive things

45:37.380 --> 45:39.300
that we all learn as babies, right,

45:39.300 --> 45:40.780
is whenever you throw something,

45:40.780 --> 45:42.100
if I was gonna toss something to you,

45:42.100 --> 45:43.140
I'd toss it up,

45:43.140 --> 45:44.820
because I know that it has to compensate

45:44.820 --> 45:47.780
for the fact that that Keplerian arc is gonna draw it down.

45:47.780 --> 45:51.380
The equations of motion are gonna draw it down.

45:51.380 --> 45:54.580
In space, I would just shoot something directly towards you,

45:54.580 --> 45:56.420
so like straight in line of sight.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.540
And so that would be very different

45:57.540 --> 45:58.700
from any type of ball sport,

45:58.700 --> 46:00.540
is to retrain your human mind,

46:00.540 --> 46:03.460
to have that as your intuitive arc of motion,

46:03.460 --> 46:04.420
or lack of arc.

46:04.420 --> 46:05.540
From your experience,

46:05.540 --> 46:08.580
from understanding how astronauts get adjusted to the stuff,

46:08.580 --> 46:10.460
how long does it take to adjust to the physics

46:10.460 --> 46:13.100
of this world, this other world?

46:13.100 --> 46:15.500
So even after one or two parabolic flights,

46:15.500 --> 46:18.700
you can gain a certain facility

46:18.700 --> 46:20.740
with moving in that environment.

46:20.740 --> 46:23.300
I think most astronauts would say maybe several days

46:23.300 --> 46:25.100
on station, or a week on station,

46:25.100 --> 46:26.860
and their brain flips.

46:26.860 --> 46:29.020
It's amazing the plasticity of the human brain,

46:29.020 --> 46:31.180
and how quickly they are able to adapt.

46:31.180 --> 46:32.100
And so pretty quickly,

46:32.100 --> 46:36.140
they become creatures of this new environment.

46:36.140 --> 46:37.580
Okay, so that's cool.

46:37.580 --> 46:39.020
It's creating a little bit of an experience.

46:39.020 --> 46:42.460
What about if you go for more than 100 days,

46:42.460 --> 46:46.140
for one year, for two years, for three years?

46:46.140 --> 46:49.140
What challenges start to emerge in that case?

46:49.140 --> 46:50.980
So Scott Kelly wrote this amazing book

46:50.980 --> 46:52.620
after he spent a year in space,

46:52.620 --> 46:53.500
and he's a twin.

46:53.500 --> 46:54.780
It's absolutely fantastic

46:54.780 --> 46:58.580
that NASA got to do a twin study, it's perfect.

46:58.580 --> 47:00.740
So he wrote a lot about his experience

47:00.740 --> 47:03.020
on the health side of what changed,

47:03.020 --> 47:06.940
things like bone density, muscle atrophy,

47:06.940 --> 47:10.100
eyesight changing because the shape of your eyeball changes,

47:10.100 --> 47:12.940
which changes your lens, which changes how you see.

47:12.940 --> 47:14.660
If we're then thinking about the challenges

47:14.660 --> 47:16.540
between a year and three years,

47:16.540 --> 47:18.540
especially if we're doing that three-year trip to Mars

47:18.540 --> 47:20.380
for your friend who asked earlier,

47:20.380 --> 47:23.980
then you have to think about nutrition.

47:23.980 --> 47:26.740
And so how are you keeping all of these different needs

47:26.740 --> 47:28.100
for your body alive?

47:28.100 --> 47:30.660
How are you protecting astronauts against radiation?

47:30.660 --> 47:33.140
Either having some type of a shell on the spacecraft,

47:33.140 --> 47:35.580
which is expensive because it's heavy.

47:35.580 --> 47:36.460
If it's something like lead,

47:36.460 --> 47:38.020
a really effective radiation shell,

47:38.020 --> 47:39.700
it's gonna be a lot of mass.

47:39.700 --> 47:42.100
Or is there a pill that could be taken

47:42.100 --> 47:46.540
to try to make you less in danger

47:46.540 --> 47:49.340
of some of the radiation effects?

47:49.340 --> 47:51.100
A lot of this has not yet been answered,

47:51.100 --> 47:53.460
but radiation is a really significant challenge

47:53.460 --> 47:55.580
for that three-year journey.

47:55.580 --> 47:57.500
And what are the negative effects of radiation

47:57.500 --> 47:59.180
on the human body out in space?

47:59.180 --> 48:03.340
A higher likelihood to develop cancer at a younger age.

48:03.340 --> 48:05.300
So you'd probably be able to get there and get back,

48:05.300 --> 48:08.140
but you'd find yourself in the same way

48:08.140 --> 48:10.780
if you were exposed to significant radiation on Earth,

48:10.780 --> 48:13.540
you'd find significant bad health effects as you age.

48:14.420 --> 48:17.220
What do you think about like decades?

48:17.220 --> 48:19.140
Do you think about decades?

48:19.140 --> 48:21.300
Or is this like an entire-

48:21.300 --> 48:25.860
I think about centuries for my space, but yeah, for decades.

48:25.860 --> 48:28.380
I think as soon as we get past the three-year mark,

48:28.380 --> 48:30.540
we'll absolutely want somewhere between three years

48:30.540 --> 48:33.660
and a decade, we'll want artificial gravity.

48:33.660 --> 48:35.340
And we know how to do that actually.

48:35.340 --> 48:37.420
The engineering questions still need to be tweaked

48:37.420 --> 48:38.500
for how we'd really implement it,

48:38.500 --> 48:41.340
but the science is there to know how we would spin

48:41.340 --> 48:44.140
habitats in orbit and generate that force.

48:44.140 --> 48:46.420
So even if the entire habitat's not spinning,

48:46.420 --> 48:49.100
you at least have a treadmill part of the space station

48:49.100 --> 48:51.500
that is spinning, and you can spend some fraction

48:51.500 --> 48:55.420
of your day in a near to 1G environment

48:55.420 --> 48:56.780
and keep your body healthy.

48:56.780 --> 48:58.420
Wait, literally from just spinning?

48:58.420 --> 49:00.220
From spinning, yes, centripetal force.

49:00.220 --> 49:01.500
So you generate this force.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.500
If you've ever been in those carnival rides,

49:03.500 --> 49:06.060
the gravitrons that spin you up around the side,

49:06.060 --> 49:07.300
that's the concept.

49:07.300 --> 49:08.900
And this is actually one of the reasons

49:08.900 --> 49:13.180
why we are spinning out a new company from my MIT lab.

49:13.180 --> 49:14.540
Spinning out, ha. Spinning out, ha.

49:14.540 --> 49:18.020
That was accidental, but well-noted space pun.

49:18.260 --> 49:20.700
Dad jokes. All right.

49:20.700 --> 49:23.860
But yeah, we're spinning out a new company

49:23.860 --> 49:27.860
to look at next generation space architecture

49:27.860 --> 49:30.580
and how do we actually scale humanity's access to space.

49:30.580 --> 49:32.580
And one of the areas that we want to look at

49:32.580 --> 49:34.100
is artificial gravity.

49:34.100 --> 49:34.940
Is there a name yet?

49:34.940 --> 49:35.780
Yep, there's a name.

49:35.780 --> 49:36.620
We are brand new.

49:36.620 --> 49:38.820
We are just exiting stealth mode.

49:38.820 --> 49:40.980
So your podcast listeners will literally be among

49:40.980 --> 49:42.580
some of the first to hear about it.

49:42.580 --> 49:45.260
It's called Aurelia Institute.

49:45.260 --> 49:48.340
Aurelia is an old English word for chrysalis.

49:48.340 --> 49:52.020
And the idea with this is that we, humanity collectively,

49:52.020 --> 49:55.660
are at this next stage of our metamorphosis,

49:55.660 --> 49:58.740
like a chrysalis, into a spacefaring species.

49:58.740 --> 50:00.900
And so we felt that this was a good time,

50:00.900 --> 50:04.380
a necessary time, to think about

50:04.380 --> 50:06.100
next generation space architecture,

50:06.100 --> 50:08.140
but also Starfleet Academy,

50:08.140 --> 50:10.140
if you know that reference from Star Trek.

50:11.060 --> 50:16.060
Yes, so let me ask a silly sounding,

50:16.380 --> 50:17.260
ridiculous sounding,

50:17.260 --> 50:19.900
but probably extremely important question.

50:19.900 --> 50:23.260
Sex and space, including intercourse, conception,

50:23.260 --> 50:27.820
procreation, birth, like being a parent,

50:27.820 --> 50:29.180
like raising the baby.

50:29.180 --> 50:33.420
So basically from birth, well, from the before birth part,

50:33.420 --> 50:34.780
like the birds and the bees and stuff,

50:34.780 --> 50:37.020
and then the whole thing.

50:37.020 --> 50:38.460
How complicated is that?

50:38.500 --> 50:41.020
I remember looking at the, thank you.

50:43.300 --> 50:46.060
I remember looking at this exact Wikipedia page, actually.

50:46.060 --> 50:48.220
And it's, I remember being,

50:48.220 --> 50:50.220
the Wikipedia page is Sex and Space,

50:50.220 --> 50:52.660
and fascinating how difficult of an engineering problem

50:52.660 --> 50:53.780
the whole thing is.

50:53.780 --> 50:55.380
Is that something you think about, too,

50:55.380 --> 50:58.940
how to have generations of humans,

50:58.940 --> 51:03.940
self-replicating organisms, societies, essentially.

51:04.780 --> 51:05.820
I mean, I guess with micro,

51:05.820 --> 51:07.540
like if you solve the gravity problem,

51:07.540 --> 51:09.060
you solve a lot of these problems.

51:09.060 --> 51:10.020
That's the hope, yeah.

51:10.020 --> 51:12.180
It's like the central challenge of microgravity

51:12.180 --> 51:13.700
to human reproduction.

51:13.700 --> 51:16.700
But we do host a workshop every year at Beyond the Cradle,

51:16.700 --> 51:18.860
which is the space event that we run at MIT.

51:18.860 --> 51:21.620
And we always do one on pregnancy in space,

51:21.620 --> 51:24.460
or motherhood, or raising children in space,

51:24.460 --> 51:26.780
because there are huge questions.

51:26.780 --> 51:29.100
There've been a few mammal studies

51:29.100 --> 51:31.100
that have looked at reproduction in space,

51:31.100 --> 51:32.540
but there are still really major questions

51:32.540 --> 51:33.860
about how does it work?

51:33.860 --> 51:36.140
How does the fetus evolve in microgravity

51:36.140 --> 51:37.380
if you were pregnant in space?

51:38.220 --> 51:39.580
And I think the near-term answer is just gonna be,

51:39.580 --> 51:43.980
we need to be able to give humans a 1G environment

51:43.980 --> 51:45.260
for that phase of our development.

51:45.260 --> 51:49.300
Yeah, so there's some studies on mice in microgravity.

51:49.300 --> 51:51.220
And it's interesting, like I think the mice,

51:51.220 --> 51:53.220
like one of them, the mice weren't able to walk,

51:53.220 --> 51:55.420
or like their understanding of physics, I guess,

51:55.420 --> 51:56.620
is off or something like that.

51:56.620 --> 51:59.980
Yeah, the mental model when you're really young

51:59.980 --> 52:03.500
and you're kind of getting your mental model of physics,

52:03.500 --> 52:07.060
we do think that that would change kids' abilities

52:07.740 --> 52:09.020
if they were born in microgravity,

52:09.020 --> 52:11.100
their ability to have that intuition

52:11.100 --> 52:13.860
around an Earth-based 1G environment might be missing,

52:13.860 --> 52:15.340
because a lot of that is crystallized

52:15.340 --> 52:17.820
in early development, early childhood development.

52:17.820 --> 52:20.060
So that makes sense that they would see that in mice, yeah.

52:20.060 --> 52:25.060
So what about life when we choose to park our vehicles

52:27.140 --> 52:30.500
on another planet, on the moon, but let's go to Mars?

52:30.500 --> 52:35.500
First of all, does that excite you, humans going to Mars,

52:35.660 --> 52:37.460
like stepping foot on Mars?

52:37.460 --> 52:38.860
And when do you think it'll happen?

52:38.860 --> 52:39.860
It does excite me.

52:39.860 --> 52:42.420
I think visionaries like Elon are working

52:42.420 --> 52:45.860
to make that happen in terms of building the road to space.

52:45.860 --> 52:48.460
We are really excited about building out

52:48.460 --> 52:51.420
the human lived experience of space once you get there.

52:51.420 --> 52:53.220
So how are you gonna grow your food?

52:53.220 --> 52:55.220
What is your habitat gonna look like?

52:55.220 --> 52:56.660
I think it's profoundly exciting,

52:56.660 --> 52:58.020
but I do think that there's a little bit

52:58.020 --> 53:02.460
of a misunderstanding of Mars anywhere in the near future

53:02.460 --> 53:05.020
being anything like a replacement for Earth.

53:05.020 --> 53:07.340
So it is good for humanity to have these other pockets

53:07.340 --> 53:10.060
of our civilization that can expand out beyond Earth,

53:10.060 --> 53:13.660
but Mars is not in its current state

53:13.660 --> 53:15.780
a good home for humanity.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.460
Too many perchlorates in the soil,

53:17.460 --> 53:19.620
you can't use that soil to grow crops.

53:19.620 --> 53:21.860
Atmosphere is too thin, certainly can't breathe it,

53:21.860 --> 53:25.460
but it's also just really thin compared to our atmosphere.

53:25.460 --> 53:26.820
A lot of different challenges that would have

53:26.820 --> 53:29.740
to be fundamentally changed on that planet

53:29.740 --> 53:33.420
to make it a good home for a large human civilization.

53:33.420 --> 53:37.980
How does a large civilization of humans get built on Mars?

53:37.980 --> 53:42.580
And where do you think it starts being difficult?

53:42.580 --> 53:46.300
So can you have a small base of like 10 people essentially,

53:46.300 --> 53:47.860
kind of like the International Space Station

53:47.860 --> 53:49.780
kind of situation?

53:49.780 --> 53:51.420
And then can you get it to a hundred,

53:51.420 --> 53:53.260
to a thousand, to a million?

53:53.260 --> 53:55.660
Are there some interesting challenges there

53:55.660 --> 53:58.940
that worry you saying that Mars is just not a good backup

53:58.940 --> 54:01.020
at this time for Earth?

54:01.020 --> 54:02.940
I think small outposts, absolutely.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.100
Like McMurdo, right?

54:04.100 --> 54:06.580
So we have these models of really extreme environments

54:06.580 --> 54:08.780
on Earth in Antarctica, for example,

54:08.780 --> 54:10.420
where humans have been able to go

54:10.420 --> 54:13.500
and make a sustainable settlement.

54:13.500 --> 54:18.500
McMurdo style life on Mars, probably feasible in the 2030s.

54:18.780 --> 54:21.140
So we wanna send the first human missions to Mars

54:21.140 --> 54:22.700
and maybe as early as the end of this decade,

54:22.700 --> 54:24.820
more likely early 2030s.

54:24.820 --> 54:28.100
Moving anywhere beyond that in terms of a place

54:28.620 --> 54:31.060
where like an entire human life would be lived,

54:31.060 --> 54:33.460
where it's not just you go for a three month deployment

54:33.460 --> 54:34.380
and you come back.

54:34.380 --> 54:36.820
That is actually the big challenge line.

54:36.820 --> 54:40.580
It's just saying, is there enough technological

54:40.580 --> 54:44.540
sophistication that can be brought that far out into space?

54:44.540 --> 54:46.540
If you imagine your electronics break,

54:46.540 --> 54:47.980
there's no radio shack.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.340
This dates me a little bit that my mind jumps to radio shack,

54:50.340 --> 54:54.140
but there's no supply chains on Mars

54:54.180 --> 54:58.140
that can supply the level of technological sophistication

54:58.140 --> 55:01.100
for all the products that we rely on on day-to-day life.

55:01.100 --> 55:03.980
So you'd be going back to actually a very simple existence,

55:03.980 --> 55:06.060
more like pioneer life out West

55:06.060 --> 55:08.740
in the story of the US, for example.

55:08.740 --> 55:13.180
And I think that the future of larger scale gatherings

55:13.180 --> 55:15.220
of humans in orbit, or sorry, in space

55:15.220 --> 55:17.700
is actually gonna be in microgravity,

55:17.700 --> 55:19.620
floating space cities,

55:19.620 --> 55:23.740
not so much trying to establish settlements

55:23.740 --> 55:25.620
on the surface.

55:25.620 --> 55:29.540
So you think sort of a significant engineering investment

55:29.540 --> 55:33.620
in terms of our efforts and money should be on large

55:35.700 --> 55:39.180
spaceships that perhaps are doing this kind of

55:39.180 --> 55:41.980
self-assembly, all these kinds of things and doing an orbit,

55:41.980 --> 55:45.500
maybe building a giant donut around the planet over time.

55:45.500 --> 55:46.340
Yeah, that is the goal.

55:46.340 --> 55:48.740
And I think the current political climate is such

55:48.740 --> 55:52.380
that you can't get the trillion dollar investment

55:52.380 --> 55:56.780
to start from scratch and build the sci-fi megastructure.

55:56.780 --> 55:59.020
But if you can build it in fits and starts

55:59.020 --> 56:00.060
in little different pieces,

56:00.060 --> 56:02.060
which is another advantage of self-assembly,

56:02.060 --> 56:04.180
it's much more like how nature works.

56:04.180 --> 56:07.620
So it's biomimicry inspired way for humanity

56:07.620 --> 56:09.780
to scale out in space.

56:09.780 --> 56:12.740
And whether it's out in space or on Mars,

56:12.740 --> 56:15.380
the idea that sort of two people fall in love,

56:16.300 --> 56:17.500
they have sex,

56:19.820 --> 56:21.620
a child is born,

56:21.620 --> 56:25.020
and then that couple has to teach that child

56:25.020 --> 56:27.660
that they came from Earth.

56:27.660 --> 56:30.580
I just love the idea that somebody is born on Mars

56:30.580 --> 56:31.780
or out in space,

56:31.780 --> 56:33.460
and you have to be like,

56:33.460 --> 56:36.420
this is not actually like the original home.

56:36.420 --> 56:38.980
Just them looking at Earth and being like,

56:38.980 --> 56:40.300
this is where we came from.

56:40.300 --> 56:42.060
I don't know, that's really inspiring to me.

56:42.060 --> 56:43.700
And the child being really confused

56:43.700 --> 56:47.580
and then wanting to go back to TikTok or whatever they do.

56:47.580 --> 56:49.140
Whatever they do in that area.

56:49.140 --> 56:50.580
I mean, there's great sci-fi, right,

56:50.580 --> 56:52.980
about people being born on Mars.

56:52.980 --> 56:55.020
And because it's a lower gravity environment,

56:55.020 --> 56:56.860
they're taller, they're more gangly

56:56.860 --> 56:58.260
if they were actually able to develop there.

56:58.260 --> 56:59.380
And then they come back to Earth

56:59.380 --> 57:01.420
and they're like second-class citizens

57:01.420 --> 57:04.100
because they can't function here in the same way

57:04.100 --> 57:06.100
because the gravity is too strong for them.

57:06.100 --> 57:07.820
You see this in series like The Expanse

57:07.820 --> 57:10.140
with the Belters and these different societies

57:10.140 --> 57:13.900
that if we were to succeed in having human societies

57:13.900 --> 57:14.980
grow up in different pockets,

57:14.980 --> 57:17.900
it's not necessarily going to be easy for them

57:17.900 --> 57:20.420
to always come back to Earth as their home.

57:21.260 --> 57:23.100
So yeah, different cultures form,

57:23.100 --> 57:24.740
which is the positive way of phrasing it,

57:24.740 --> 57:28.860
but it's also, this human history teaches us that we have,

57:28.860 --> 57:30.660
we like to form the other.

57:30.660 --> 57:33.860
So there's this kind of conflict that naturally emerges.

57:33.860 --> 57:36.460
Let me ask another sort of dark question.

57:36.460 --> 57:39.220
What do you think about coming from a military family?

57:40.260 --> 57:44.620
There's still sadly wars in the world.

57:44.620 --> 57:47.700
Do you think wars, military conflicts,

57:47.700 --> 57:51.380
just space, wars between nations?

57:51.380 --> 57:54.100
Like from my perspective currently,

57:54.100 --> 57:57.780
it just seems like space is a place for scientists

57:57.780 --> 58:00.140
and engineers to explore ideas.

58:00.140 --> 58:02.740
But the more and more progress you make,

58:02.740 --> 58:06.020
does it worry you that nations start to step in

58:06.020 --> 58:09.820
and form, you know, that go out

58:09.820 --> 58:11.700
and fall out military conflict,

58:11.700 --> 58:15.660
whether it's in cyberspace, in space,

58:15.660 --> 58:18.420
or actual hot war?

58:18.420 --> 58:19.940
I am really concerned about that.

58:19.940 --> 58:22.060
And I do think for decades,

58:22.060 --> 58:24.260
the scientific community in space has hung on

58:24.260 --> 58:28.020
to this notion from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty,

58:28.020 --> 58:30.420
which is space is the province of all humankind,

58:30.420 --> 58:32.820
peaceful uses of outer space only.

58:32.820 --> 58:35.020
But I do think the rise in tensions

58:35.020 --> 58:37.380
and the geopolitical scene that we're seeing,

58:38.420 --> 58:40.980
I do, yeah, I do harbor a lot of concern

58:40.980 --> 58:44.900
about hot wars following humanity out into space.

58:44.900 --> 58:49.380
And it's worth trying to tie nations together

58:49.380 --> 58:52.020
with more collaboration to avoid that happening.

58:52.020 --> 58:53.780
The International Space Station is a great example.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.540
I think it's something like 18 countries

58:55.540 --> 58:57.100
are party to this treaty.

58:57.100 --> 58:59.380
It might be less, it might be more.

58:59.380 --> 59:01.140
And then of course, there's a smaller number of countries

59:01.140 --> 59:02.660
that actually send astronauts.

59:02.660 --> 59:05.700
But even at the fall of the Soviet Union

59:05.700 --> 59:07.940
and through some tense times with Russia,

59:07.940 --> 59:10.740
the ISS had been a place where the US and Russia

59:10.740 --> 59:14.020
were actually able to collaborate between Mir and ISS.

59:14.020 --> 59:17.100
I think it'd be really important right now in particular

59:17.100 --> 59:20.620
to find other platforms where these hegemonic powers

59:20.620 --> 59:23.540
in the world and developing world nations

59:23.540 --> 59:26.780
can come and collaborate on the future of space

59:26.780 --> 59:29.580
and purposefully intertwine our success

59:29.580 --> 59:31.380
so that there's a danger to multiple parties

59:31.380 --> 59:32.980
if somebody is a bad actor.

59:32.980 --> 59:36.580
So we're now talking as there's a war in Ukraine

59:36.580 --> 59:37.940
and I haven't been sleeping much,

59:37.940 --> 59:42.940
I have family, friends, colleagues in both countries.

59:43.220 --> 59:45.540
And I'm just talking to a lot of people,

59:45.540 --> 59:48.820
many of whom are crying, refugees.

59:48.820 --> 59:53.780
And there's a basic human compassion and love for each other

59:53.780 --> 59:58.780
that I believe technology can help catalyze and accelerate.

59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.180
But there's also science, there's something about rockets,

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.820
there's something about, and I mean like space exploration

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:10.820
that inspires the world about the positive possibilities

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.620
of the human species.

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.780
So in terms of Ukraine and Russia and China and India

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:22.860
and the United States and Europe and everywhere else,

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:27.860
it seems like collaborating on giant space projects

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.140
is one way to escape these wars,

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.700
to escape these sort of geopolitical conflicts.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.540
I mean, there's something,

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:37.420
there's so much camaraderie to the whole thing.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:42.420
And even in this little period of human history,

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.460
we're living through, it seems like that's essential.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.700
Even through this pandemic,

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:49.180
there is something so inspiring

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:52.300
about those like SpaceX rockets going up, for example.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.420
It's true.

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:57.140
This reinvigoration of the space exploration efforts

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.940
by the commercial sector.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:00.940
I don't know, that was,

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.180
I had some, as many of us have,

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.420
sort of some dark times during this pandemic,

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.140
just like loneliness and sometimes emotion and anger

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.700
and just hopelessness and politics.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.740
And then you look at those rockets going up

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.180
and it just gives you hope.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.420
So I think that's an understated sort of value

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:24.740
of space exploration is a thing that unites us

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.380
and gives us hope.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:29.220
Obviously it also inspires young generations

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.540
and young minds to also contribute

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.060
in not necessarily in space exploration,

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:35.460
but in all of science and literature and poetry.

01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:38.180
There's something about when you look up to the stars,

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:39.820
it makes you dream.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.100
And so that's a really good reason to sort of invest in this,

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.180
whether it's building giant megastructures,

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.460
which is so freaking cool,

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:52.740
but also colonizing Mars.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.020
Yeah, it's something to look forward to.

01:01:56.020 --> 01:02:01.020
Something that, and not make it a domain of war,

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.580
but a domain of human collaboration

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.860
and human compassion, I think.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.300
You're the founder and director

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.340
of the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.500
It includes a ton of projects.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.620
So I just wanted to, they're focused, I guess,

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.860
on life in space from astrobiology,

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.220
like we talked about, to habitats.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.900
Are there some other interesting projects

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.500
part of this initiative that popped to mind

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.340
that you find particularly cool?

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:30.340
Absolutely.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.420
One is the future of in-space manufacturing.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.780
So if we're gonna build large-scale space structures,

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.820
yes, it's great to ship them up from Earth

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.260
and self-assemble them,

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.940
but what about extrusion in orbit?

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.420
It's one of the best technologies to leverage

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.380
in microgravity because you can extrude

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.340
a particularly long beam that would sag

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.100
in a normal gravity environment,

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.620
but might be able to become the basis of a truss

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.140
or a large-scale space structure.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.020
So we're doing miniature tests of extrusion

01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:59.340
and are excited to fly this

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.900
on the International Space Station in a few months.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.380
We are working on swarm robots.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:08.940
We have just announced, actually, MIT's return to the Moon.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.540
So my organization is leading this mission for MIT,

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:12.980
going back to the surface of the Moon

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:15.460
as early as the end of this year, 2022,

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:20.140
maybe early 2023, and trying to take data

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:24.460
from our research payloads at this historic South Pole site

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.180
where NASA's supposed to send the first humans back

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.260
on the Artemis III mission.

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.740
So our hope is to directly support that human mission

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.140
with our data.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.420
How does that connect to the swarm aspects?

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:35.740
Does it connect?

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.060
Yeah, so we're actually gonna fly

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.460
one of the little astro ants.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:39.860
That's the current plan.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:43.420
One of the little swarm robots on the top of a rover.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.500
That's part of the mission.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:45.700
Ants riding a rover?

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.220
Yes, exactly, an ant riding a rover.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:49.900
That rover gets packed in a lander.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.060
That lander gets packed in a SpaceX rocket.

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:55.460
So it's a whole nesting doll situation to get to the Moon.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.260
Mother of robot dragons.

01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.660
Yes, exactly.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:01.580
So this one, a swarm of one?

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:02.740
Swarm of one, exactly.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:03.740
We're testing out.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.860
It's a tech demonstration mission, not a true swarm.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.700
Yeah, there they are.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.260
Those are the astro ants.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:11.660
Wow, and so it's a distributed system,

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:14.220
and in theory, you could have a ton of these.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:15.940
Yes, these could also be centralized.

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:17.460
So they have wireless technology

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.860
that could also talk to a central base station,

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.580
and we'll be assessing kind of case by case

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.900
whether it makes sense to operate them

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.580
in a decentralized swarm or to command them

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:27.860
in a centralized swarm.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.980
Each robot is equipped with four magnetic wheels,

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.460
which enable the robot to attach to any magnetic surface

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:37.540
so you can operate basically in any environment.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.780
He tested the, we tested the mobility of all robots

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:44.620
on different materials in a microgravity environment.

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:46.700
On the vomit comet prior to going to the Moon.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.100
That must look so cool.

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.620
So they're basically moving along

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.860
different like metallic surfaces.

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:52.940
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.260
It's interesting when you, just a minute ago,

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.820
talking about the reflection of how space

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.900
can be so aspirational and so uniting.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.700
There's a great quote from Bill Anders

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.300
from the Apollo 8 mission to the Moon, which is he,

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.260
it's the Earthrise photo that was taken

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:09.740
where you see the Earth coming up

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.820
over the horizon of the Moon,

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.820
and the quote is something along the lines of,

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.180
we came all the way to discover the Moon,

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:17.900
and what we really discovered was the Earth,

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.100
this really powerful image looking back.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.380
And so we're also trying to think for our lunar mission,

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.580
we realized we're a very privileged group at MIT

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.300
to get the opportunity to do this.

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:29.020
How could we bring humanity along with us?

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.060
And so one of the things we're still testing out,

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.740
I don't know if we're gonna be able to swing it,

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:35.540
would be to do something like a Twitch plays Pokemon,

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:36.900
but with the robot.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.540
So let a lot of people on Earth actually control the robot

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.980
or at least benefit from the data that we're gathering

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.980
and try to release the data openly.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.540
So we're exploring a couple of different ideas

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.340
for how do we engage more people in this mission.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:51.420
That'll be surreal to be able to interact

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.860
in some way with the thing that's out there.

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.460
On another surface.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:56.540
Direct connection.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.660
Direct connection.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.260
I think about artificial intelligence in that same way,

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:06.260
which is like building robots puts a mirror to us humans.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.500
It makes us like wonder about like, what is intelligence?

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.620
What is consciousness?

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:14.540
And what is actually valuable about human beings?

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:18.300
When AI system learns to play chess better than humans,

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.740
you start to let go of this idea that humans are special

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.780
because of intelligence.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.700
It's something else.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.220
Maybe the flame of human consciousness.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:32.700
It's the capacity to feel deeply,

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.380
to sort of to both suffer and to love all those things.

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.860
And that somehow AI to me, so it puts a mirror to that.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.980
You mentioned Hal 9000, you have to bring it up

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:47.540
with these swarm bots crawling on the surface

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.860
of your cocoon in space.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.500
I mean, all right.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:56.620
Let me steel man the Hal 9000 perspective.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.460
Okay.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:02.180
The poor guy just wanted to maintain the mission

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:03.900
and the astronauts were, I mean,

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.740
I don't know if people often talk about that,

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:09.980
but you know, like doctors have to make difficult decisions.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.660
So when there's limited resources,

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.060
you actually do have to sacrifice human life often

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.740
because you have to make decisions.

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:20.180
And I think Hal is probably making that kind of decision

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.860
about what's more important,

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:26.660
the lives of individual astronauts or the mission.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:30.260
And I feel like AI and other humans

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:33.060
will need to make these decisions.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.220
And it also feels like AI systems

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.980
will need to help make those decisions.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.220
I don't know.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:43.140
I guess my question is about greater

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:46.060
and greater collective intelligence by systems.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.740
Do you worry about that?

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.780
What is the right way to sort of solve this problem,

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.980
keeping a human in the loop?

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.420
Do you think about this kind of stuff

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.340
or are they sufficiently dumb now,

01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:00.460
the robots that's not yet on the horizon to think about?

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:01.860
I think it should be on the horizon.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:03.660
It's always good to think about these things early

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.220
because we make a lot of technical design decisions

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.180
at this phase working with swarm robots

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.780
that it would be better to have thought about

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.980
some of these questions early

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.260
in the life cycle of a project.

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:15.460
There is a real interest in NASA right now

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.460
thinking about the future of human-robot interaction, HRI,

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:21.500
and what is the right synergy in terms of level of control

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.940
for the human versus level of dependence

01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.860
or control for the robot.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:30.380
And we're beginning to test out more of these scenarios.

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.900
For example, the Gateway Space Station,

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.700
which is meant to be in orbit around the moon

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.460
as a staging base for the surface operations,

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.500
is meant to be able to function autonomously

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.620
with no humans in it for months at a time

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.140
because they think it's going to be seasonal.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.340
They think we might not be constantly staffing it.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.940
So this will be a really great test of,

01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.660
I don't know that anybody's yet worried

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.380
about how 9,000 evolving,

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:55.940
but certainly just the robustness of some of these AI systems

01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:59.100
that might be asked to autonomously maintain the station

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.460
while the humans are away.

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:03.860
Or detection algorithms that are going to say,

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.100
if you had a human pilot,

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.140
they might see debris in orbit and steer around it.

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.860
There'll be a lot of autonomy in the space.

01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.940
If you had a human pilot in orbit and steer around it,

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:11.300
there'll be a lot of autonomous navigation

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.820
that has to happen.

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:14.180
That'll be one of the early test beds

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.660
where we'll start to get a little bit closer to that future.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.380
Well, the HRI component is really interesting to me,

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.780
especially when the AI includes almost friendship

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.580
because people don't realize this, I think,

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.900
that we humans long for connection.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.300
And when you have even a basic interaction

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.300
that's supposed to be just serving you or something,

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.740
you still project,

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:42.740
it's still a source of meaning and connection.

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.060
And so you do have to think about that.

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.700
I mean, how 9,000,

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.020
the movie maybe doesn't portray it that way,

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.820
but I'm sure there's a relationship there

01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:56.260
between the astronauts and the robot,

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.100
especially when you have

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.780
greater and greater level of intelligence.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.980
Maybe that addresses the happiness question too.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:06.300
I think there's a great book by Kate Darling,

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.180
who's one of my colleagues at MIT.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.500
Yeah, she's amazing.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.500
She's already been on this podcast,

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.860
but we talk all the time and we're supposed to talk

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.180
and we've been missing each other

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.540
and we're gonna make it happen soon.

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:20.460
Come down to Texas, Kate.

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.300
All right.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.300
Anyway, yeah, she's amazing.

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.580
And she has this book.

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.140
Her whole work is about this.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:26.540
Connection with robots, yeah.

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.460
This beautiful connection that we have with robots.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.580
But I think it's greater and greater importance

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.220
when it's out in space

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:34.900
because it could help alleviate some of the loneliness.

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:35.740
Right.

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:37.340
One of the projects in the book that I gave you,

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.020
which is a catalog of the projects

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.740
that we've worked on over the last five years,

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.940
is this social robot that was developed at the Media Lab.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.300
And one of the first years in 2017

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.900
that we flew a Zergi flight,

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.660
we took the social robot along

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:50.740
and tried to do a little bit

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.980
of a very scaled down human study

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.100
to look at these questions,

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.900
because you do imagine that we would form a bond,

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.860
a real bond with the social robots

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:01.580
that might be not just serving us on a mission,

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:04.500
but really be our teammates on a future mission.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.660
And I do think that that could have a powerful role

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.660
in the mental health and just the stability of a crew

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.900
is to have some other robot friends come along.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:11.740
What do you, by the way,

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:14.500
the book you mentioned is

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.340
Into the Anthropocosmos,

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.980
a whole space catalog from the space catalog.

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:22.820
Get that reference.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.260
Yeah, so call out to Earth catalog,

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:26.780
a whole space catalog from

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.460
the MIT Space Exploration Initiative.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:31.860
What about the happiness?

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:33.900
You said that that's one of the problems

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.860
of when you're out in space.

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.460
How do you keep humans happy?

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.740
Again, asking for a friend.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:41.140
Yes, I mean, one of the big challenges is

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.420
you can't just open a window

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:45.900
or walk out a door and blow off steam, right?

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:49.260
You can't just go somewhere to clear your head.

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.900
And in that sense,

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:54.300
you need to build habitats that are homes

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.940
that really care for the humans inside them

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.260
and have, whether it's biophilia

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.060
and a place where you can go and feel like you're in nature

01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:05.820
or a VR headset, which for some people is a

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:09.220
porcimulcrum, but is maybe better than nothing.

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.540
You need to be thinking about these

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.700
technological interventions that are gonna have to be

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.420
part of your home and be part of your

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:19.060
maybe day-to-day ritual to keep you steady

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.860
and balanced and happy or feeling fulfilled.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.100
What about other humans,

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.620
relationship with other humans?

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:28.060
Do those get weird

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:30.420
when you get past a certain number of humans?

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.700
I'm not an expert in this area,

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:33.100
but an anecdote that I'll share.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.300
My understanding is that NASA has still not decided

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.460
whether it's better to send married couples

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:41.140
or single crew members in terms of,

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:43.140
you want some level of stability.

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:45.620
You don't wanna have the drama of romantic relationships

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.660
like you're alluding to before,

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:50.660
but they can't decide because married couples also fight

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.140
and have a really tough dynamic.

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.460
And so there's a lot of open questions still to answer

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:57.580
about what is the ideal psychological makeup of a crew?

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.860
And we're starting to test some of these things

01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.860
with the civilian crews that are going up with

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.980
Inspiration4 like last fall with SpaceX and Axe 1

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.420
that's gonna fly in a few days here in March.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:10.940
As we begin to lengthen the time of those civilian crews,

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.100
I think we'll start to learn a little bit more about

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.820
just average everyday human-to-human dynamics

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.340
and not the astronauts that are themselves selected

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.620
to be perfect human specimens, very good to work with,

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.100
easy to get along with.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:26.420
I wish you collected more data about this pandemic

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:29.300
because I feel like it's a good rough simulation

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:30.500
of what it'd be like out in space.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.580
A lot of people were locked down, some married couples.

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.420
I think a lot of marriages broke up.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.460
A lot of marriages got closer together.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.140
So it's like, and then the single people,

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.140
some of them went off the cliff

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.740
and some of them discovered their new happiness

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:46.860
and meaning and so on.

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:50.140
It's a beautiful little experiment, a painful one.

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.620
Is there a thorough way to really test that?

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.740
Because it's such a costly experiment

01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:59.820
to send humans up there,

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.580
but I guess you can always return back to Earth

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:02.780
if it's not working out.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.620
That's what we hope.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:04.620
That's what we hope.

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.020
You don't have like a Apollo 13 situation

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.060
that doesn't quite make it back.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.940
But yeah, this is also why Mars is such a challenge.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.580
The moon is only three days away.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.300
That's a lot quicker to recover from

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:17.060
if there's a psychological problem with the crew

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:19.420
or any type of maintenance problem, anything.

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.740
Three years is such a challenge

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.060
compared to these other domains

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.300
that we've been getting more used to

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.980
in terms of human space flight.

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:29.900
So this is a question that we will need

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.420
to have explored more before we start

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.060
really sending crews to Mars.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:36.180
So you're a young scientist.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.460
Do you think in your lifetime,

01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:43.540
you will go out into orbit?

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:47.420
You will go out beyond into deep space

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:50.420
and potentially step you,

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.340
I don't know if you can call yourself a civilian.

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.780
I don't know if that's what you count as,

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:59.780
but you as a curious aunt from MIT, land, step on Mars.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:04.540
Yes.

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.300
That's a firm, that's a firm.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.140
Are you coming back?

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:09.020
Firm, yes, yeah, I'm coming back.

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.180
I don't want that one-way mission.

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.140
I want the two-way mission.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.260
But yes, I mean, I think we're already talking

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.300
about a pretty near-term opportunity

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.940
where I could send graduate students

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.180
to the International Space Station.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.020
First, okay.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:24.340
So no, not a sacrifice,

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.180
but send graduate students.

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:27.020
For the experience.

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:29.460
Send graduate students to the ISS to do their research.

01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:31.780
I do think you and I both would have an opportunity

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:35.700
to go to a lunar base of some sort within our lifetime.

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:39.660
And there's a good chance if we really wanted to,

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.780
we might have to really advocate for it,

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.300
apply to an astronaut program.

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.780
There will be some avenues for humans in our lifetime

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.780
to go to Mars.

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.100
What's the bar for like health?

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.380
Do you think that bar will keep getting lower and lower

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:55.300
in terms of how healthy, how athletic,

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.860
like how the psychological profile,

01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.980
all those kinds of things?

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:01.580
Yeah, for one, we're gonna build more robust habitats

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.380
that don't depend on astronauts

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.300
being so impeccably well-trained.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.260
So we're gonna make it better for inclusion

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.460
and just opening access to space.

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.780
But there's a fantastic group called Astra Access

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:15.500
that is already helping disabled space flyers

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.500
to do zero-G flights and potentially get access to the ISS.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.780
And some of the things that we think of as disabilities

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:24.820
on earth are hyper abilities in space.

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.540
You don't need really powerful legs in space.

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:30.780
What you'd really benefit from having is a third arm,

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.420
more ways to kind of move yourself around

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.660
and grip and interact.

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:38.100
So we are already seeing a much more open-minded approach

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:40.060
to who gets to go to space.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.940
And Astra Access is a wonderful organization

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.460
doing some of that work.

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:47.700
I'm hoping introversion will also be a superpower in space.

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.020
Okay, well, first, I'd love to get your opinion

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.820
on commercial space flight,

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.220
what SpaceX or Blue Origin are doing.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.780
And also another question on top of that is,

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:01.380
because you've worked with a lot of different kinds

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:05.780
of people culturally, what's the difference between SpaceX

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:10.780
or commercial type of efforts, NASA and MIT?

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:11.820
And academia.

01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:12.780
Academia.

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.460
Yeah, so to the first part of your question,

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:18.380
I am thrilled by all of the commercial activity in space.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.020
It has really empowered our program.

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:23.540
So instead of me waiting for five years to get a grant

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:24.620
and get the money from the grant

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:26.980
and only then can you send a project to space,

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:29.700
I go out and I fundraise a lot like a startup founder

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.460
and I directly buy access to space

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.620
on the International Space Station

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.260
through SpaceX or NanoRacks,

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:37.540
same with Blue Origin and their suborbital craft,

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:40.380
same with Axiom now, Axiom's making plans

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.500
for their own commercial space station.

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:44.180
It's not out of the realm of possibility,

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.340
but in a few years, I will rent lab space in orbit.

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:50.900
I will rent a module from the Axiom space station

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.980
or the orbital reef, which is the Blue Origin space station

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:56.820
or NanoRacks is thinking about Starlab Oasis.

01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:57.980
There's probably some other companies

01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.060
that I'm not even aware of yet

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.900
that are doing commercial space habitats.

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.820
So I think that's fabulous

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.780
and really empowering for our research.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.340
Is it affordable?

01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:09.780
So like loosely speaking, does it become affordable

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:13.820
for like MIT type of research lab?

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:18.180
Does it, you know, or does it need to be a multi-university

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:20.780
like a gigantic effort, a consortium thing?

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.780
One of the reasons we're spinning out Aurelia

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:24.620
is we actually realized it's cheap enough.

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.660
It doesn't even have to be MIT.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.620
And we wanted to start democratizing access

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:30.940
to these space flight opportunities

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:33.020
to a much broader swath of humanity.

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:34.180
Could you take a, you know,

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:37.100
Khan Academy educational course about,

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:38.820
hey students around the world,

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.740
this is how you get ready for a zero-g flight.

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:43.300
And by the way, come fly with us next year,

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.820
which is something we're gonna do with Aurelias.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.020
We're gonna bring, you know, much more

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.060
just kind of day-to-day folks on zero-g flights

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:52.580
and get them access to engaging in the space industry.

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.700
So it's become cheap enough

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.980
and the prices have dropped enough to consider even that.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:57.980
So that's amazing.

01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:58.820
It definitely doesn't have to be

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:00.900
a consortium of universities anymore.

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.020
Depends on what you wanna fly.

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.420
If you wanna fly James Webb,

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.860
a huge telescope that's decades in the making,

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.940
sure, you need a NASA allocation budget.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.540
You need billions.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.460
But for a lot of the stuff in the book

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.580
and our research portfolio,

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.020
it's actually becoming far more accessible.

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.540
So that's commercial.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.220
What about NASA and MIT academia?

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.900
Yeah, I think, you know,

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.740
people have been worried about NASA the last few years

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:28.420
because in some people's minds,

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:31.580
they are seeding ground to these commercial efforts,

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.380
but that's really not what's happening.

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:37.580
NASA empowered these commercial efforts

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:40.060
because they wanna free themselves up to go to Mars

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.980
and go to Europa and continue being

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.980
that really aspirational force for humanity

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.860
of pushing the boundary, always pushing the boundary.

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.860
And if they were anchored in low earth orbit,

01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:53.220
maintaining a space station indefinitely,

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.780
that's so much a part of their budget

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:57.140
that it was keeping them from being able to do more.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.020
So it actually is really fantastic for NASA

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.900
to have grown this commercial ecosystem

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:03.020
and then that frees NASA up to go further.

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.500
And in academia, we like to think

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:05.860
that we will be able to do

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:09.420
the provocative next generation research

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:13.060
that is going to unlock things at that frontier.

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.860
And we can partner with NASA,

01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:15.900
we can go through a program

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.100
if we wanna send a probe out really far,

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.500
but we can also partner with SpaceX

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.660
and see what human life in a SpaceX Mars settlement

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:24.820
might look like and how we could design for that.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.540
Speaking of projects, maybe are there other projects

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:30.060
that popped to mind from the space exploration initiative

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.780
or maybe stuff from the book, the convention?

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.300
Something super cool.

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.820
I mean, everything we've been talking about is cool,

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.820
but just something that pops to mind again.

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:40.540
Yeah, so we talked about life in space

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.700
and you might need more arms than legs.

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.820
One of the projects by Valentina Sumini

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:48.700
was a air powered robotics tail.

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:50.420
So it's a soft robotics tail

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:53.020
that essentially has a little camera on the back end of it,

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.700
can do computer vision and knows where to grapple.

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:56.860
So it's behind you.

01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.340
It grapples onto something and holds you in space

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:00.460
and then you can actually free up

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:02.100
both of your hands to work.

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.060
So we're already starting to think about the design

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:07.420
of bionic humans or prosthetics or things

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.260
that would make you kind of like a cyborg

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:11.620
to augment your capabilities

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:13.180
when you're in a space environment.

01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:14.620
How would you control something like that?

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:18.020
So it's kind of like a, I mean, you can't call it a leg,

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:18.860
but whatever.

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:20.260
It's an additional appendage.

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:21.780
Appendage, so how would you,

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.860
what are ideas for controlling something like that?

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:26.620
Yeah, so right now it's super, yeah, there you go.

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:27.460
That's cool.

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:28.780
Right now it's super manual.

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:32.380
It's basically just like a kind of a set pattern

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:34.140
of inflating as we're testing it.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.940
But in the future, if we had a neurolink,

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:36.780
I mean, this is something

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:38.980
that you could imagine directly controlling,

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.340
just thinking thoughts and controlling it.

01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.540
That's a ways away.

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:45.340
Yeah, so we talked about on the biology side,

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.820
astrobiology, there's probably agriculture stuff.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.220
Is there other things that kind of feed the ecosystem

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.140
of out in space for survival

01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:56.140
or the robotics architectures, the self-assembly stuff?

01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.700
So kind of combining something,

01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:58.900
we were talking about,

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:00.940
you can form these relationships with objects

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:02.540
and anthropomorphize.

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.740
One of the things that we're thinking about for agriculture

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:08.620
created by Manwe and Somu, so two students at MIT,

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:10.820
was this little, it looks like a planet,

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.100
but it's inspired by, I think,

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:14.900
a mandala or Nepalese spinning wheel.

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:16.580
And you plant plants on the inside

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:19.060
and the astronaut has to spin it every day

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.820
to help the plants survive.

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.860
So it's a way to give the astronaut something to care about,

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:26.260
something that they are responsible for keeping alive

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:28.980
and can really invest themselves in.

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.460
And it's not necessary, right?

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:33.420
We have other ways to grow in orbit.

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.980
Hydroponics, liquid medium,

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.340
trying to keep the liquid around the plant roots is hard

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:38.940
because there's no gravity to pull it down

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:40.300
in a particular direction.

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.580
But what I loved about this project was they said,

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:45.460
sure, we have ways that the plants could grow on their own,

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.940
but the astronauts might want to care for it

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:49.540
in the same way that we have little plants

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:52.580
that come to be important to us, little plant friends.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:53.740
Yeah, so there's agrifuge.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:58.140
It's an early model of this manually spinning plant habitat.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.620
I guess this is the best of academic research

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.260
is you can do these kinds of wild ideas.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.620
Wild ideas, yeah.

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.340
Well, I get to spend quite a bit of time

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:12.340
with Mr. Elon Musk and he's very stressed,

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.620
especially about Starship

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.380
and all those kinds of engineering efforts.

01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:17.900
Yeah.

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.700
What do you think about how damn hard it is

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.620
to get out of space?

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:26.220
Like, are we humans gonna be able to do this?

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:27.900
I don't know.

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:30.420
I think it feels like it's an engineering problem,

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:31.540
it's a scientific problem,

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.540
but it's also just a motivation problem

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:35.540
for the entire human species.

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:39.660
And you also need to have superstar researchers

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:40.940
and engineers working on it.

01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:43.060
So you have to get the best people in the world,

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:47.340
inspire them, and starting from a young age and kind of-

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.180
Almost inculcating us into why we do it.

01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.460
I mean, I guess this way it's exciting.

01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:52.540
You don't know if we're gonna be able to pull this off.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.380
That we could fail miserably.

01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.820
And that, I suppose, I mean,

01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:00.060
that's where the best of engineering is done,

01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:02.940
is like, success is not guaranteed.

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:06.380
And even if it happens, it might be very painful.

01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:07.300
I think that's what's so special

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.020
about what Elon is doing with SpaceX,

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:12.100
is he takes these risks and he tests iteratively

01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.940
and he'll see the spectacular failures

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.540
on the path to a successful Starship.

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:18.740
It's something that people have said,

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.020
why isn't NASA doing that?

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.540
Well, that's because NASA is doing that

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.460
with taxpayer dollars and we would all revolt

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:26.260
if we saw NASA failing at all these different stages.

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:30.260
But that level of spiral engineering theory of development

01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:31.620
isn't super impressive.

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:32.820
And it's a really interesting approach

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.420
that SpaceX has taken.

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.980
And I think between people like Elon and Jeff Bezos

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:41.580
and Firefly and NASA and ESO, we are gonna get there.

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.220
They're building the road to space.

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:45.060
These trailblazers are doing it.

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:47.820
And now part of the challenge is to get the rest

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:52.100
of the public to understand that it's happening, right?

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:54.340
A lot of people don't know that we're going back to the moon,

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.540
that we're gonna send the first woman to the moon

01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.820
within a few years.

01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:58.740
A lot of people don't know

01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:00.780
that there are commercial space stations in orbit,

01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:03.420
that it's not just NASA that does space stuff.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:07.140
So we have a big challenge to get more of humanity excited

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.580
and educated and involved again,

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:09.940
kind of like in the Apollo era

01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:12.460
where it was a big deal for everybody.

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:15.220
Well, a lot of that is also one of the big impressive things

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:18.660
that Elon does, I think, extremely well

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:21.380
is the social media, is the getting people excited.

01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:24.980
And I think that actually he's helped NASA step their game

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.620
up in terms of social media.

01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:28.780
There's something about, yeah, the storytelling,

01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:33.780
but also not like authentic and just real and raw engineering.

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:40.660
There's a lot of excitement for that humor and fun also.

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:44.340
All of those things you realize, the thing that make up

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:47.300
the virality of the meme is beautiful.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.980
You have to kind of embrace that.

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:55.660
To me, this kind of, I criticize a lot of companies

01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:59.460
based on this, I talked to a bunch of CEOs and so on.

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:02.020
And it's just like, there's a caution.

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.700
Let us do this press conference thing

01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:08.260
where when the final product is ready and it's overproduced

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.700
as opposed to the raw, the gritty, just show it off.

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.060
I mean, something that I think MIT is very good at doing

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.620
is just showing the raw, by nature, the mess of it.

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:20.100
And the mess of it is beautiful and people get really excited

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:21.820
and failure is really exciting.

01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:23.980
When the thing blows up and you're like, oh shit,

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:27.100
that makes it even more exciting when it doesn't blow up.

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.100
And doing all of that on social media

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.740
and showing also the humans behind it,

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:35.260
the individual young researchers or the engineers

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:38.540
or the leaders where everything's at stake.

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:40.900
I don't know, I think I'm really excited about that.

01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:43.860
I do want MIT to do that more for students

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.300
to show off their stuff and not be pressured

01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:51.100
to do this kind of generic official presentation,

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.500
but show their, become a YouTuber also.

01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.900
Like show off your raw research as you're working on it

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:58.140
in the early days.

01:26:58.140 --> 01:26:59.500
I hope that's the future.

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.300
Things like, I was teasing about TikTok earlier,

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:07.300
but these kinds of things I think inspire young people

01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:11.300
to show off their stuff, to show their true self,

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:12.140
the rawness of it.

01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:13.980
Because I think that's where engineering is best.

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.220
And I think that will inspire people

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:19.020
about all the cool stuff we could do out in space.

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:20.300
I should say, I couldn't agree more.

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.020
And I actually think that this is why we need

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.780
a real life Starfleet Academy right now.

01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:27.180
It was the place where the space cadets got to go

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:31.460
to learn about how to engage in a future of life in space.

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.940
And we can do it in a much better way.

01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:35.220
There are a bunch of groups that traditionally

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:37.900
haven't thought that they could engage in aerospace.

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:38.980
Whether it's because you were told

01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.740
you had to be into math and science.

01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.260
Now, we need space lawyers.

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:44.300
We need space artists like Grimes, right?

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:48.220
We need really creative, profoundly interesting people

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.780
to wanna see themselves in that future.

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:53.980
And I think it's a big challenge to us in the space industry

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:56.580
to also do some more diversity, equity, and inclusion

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:58.980
and show a broader swath of society

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.420
that there's a future for them

01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:02.060
in this space exploration vision.

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:03.220
Let me push back on one thing.

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.540
We don't need space lawyers.

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:05.380
I'm just kidding.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.740
Okay, that's a joke.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.940
We do, we do, we do.

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.780
Okay, we do.

01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:11.460
Space lawyers are great, I love them.

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.900
Okay, let me ask a big ridiculous question.

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.180
What is the most beautiful idea to you

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.260
about space exploration?

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:22.620
Whether it's the engineering, the astrobiology,

01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:27.620
the science, the inspiration, the human happiness,

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.300
or aliens, I don't know.

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:35.300
What do you, like, inspires you every day

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:39.620
in terms of its beauty, in terms of its awe?

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:43.340
As a ex-physicist, what I've always found so profound

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:47.140
is just that at really, really small scales,

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.380
like particle physics,

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.580
and really, really big scales like astrophysics,

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.420
there are similarities in the way

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:55.620
that those systems behave and look.

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:59.500
And there's a certain beautiful symmetry in the universe

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.140
that's just kind of waiting for us

01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:04.300
to tie together the physics and really understand it.

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.780
That is something that just really captivates me.

01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:09.940
And I would love to, even though I'm now much more

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:12.500
on the applied space exploration side,

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.260
I really try to keep up with what's happening

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:15.180
in those physics areas,

01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:18.420
because I think that will be a huge answer for humanity

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:21.540
along the lines of, are we alone in the universe?

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:24.220
One of the fascinating things about you

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:29.220
is you have a degree in physics, mathematics, and philosophy,

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:32.140
and now, I don't know, what'd you call it?

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.340
Aerospace engineering, maybe, kind of thing.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:36.980
So you have a foot in all of these worlds.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:41.980
The theoretic, the beauty of that world,

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.700
and the philosophy somehow is in there,

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:48.420
and now the very practical, pragmatic implementation

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:50.900
of all these wild ideas,

01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.340
plus your incredible communicator, all those things.

01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:56.140
What did you pick up from those different disciplines?

01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:57.580
Or maybe I'm just romanticizing

01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:59.420
all those different disciplines.

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.780
But what did you pick up from the variety

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:06.220
of that physics, mathematics, philosophy?

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:07.900
What I loved about having this chance

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.140
to do a liberal arts education

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.460
was trying to understand the human condition,

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:16.460
and I think more designers for space exploration

01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:17.780
should be thinking about that,

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:19.820
because there's so much depth of,

01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.220
like we were talking about,

01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:24.460
issues and opportunities around human connection,

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:27.100
human life, meaning in life,

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.420
how do you find fulfillment or happiness?

01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:31.220
And I think if you approach these questions

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.740
just purely from the standpoint

01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:33.980
of an engineer or a scientist,

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:38.260
you'll miss some of what makes it a life worth living.

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.380
And so I love being able to combine

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.820
some of this notion of philosophy

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.700
and the human condition with my work,

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.300
but I'm also a pragmatist,

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:47.180
and I didn't wanna stay just purely

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.980
in these big picture questions about the universe.

01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:52.300
I wanted to have an impact on society,

01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:55.980
and I also felt like I had such a wonderful childhood

01:30:55.980 --> 01:31:00.980
and a really fantastic setup that I owe society some work

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:04.380
to really make a positive impact

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:05.620
for a broader swath of citizens.

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.820
And so that kind of led me from the physics domain

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:09.340
to thinking about engineering

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:11.220
and practical questions for life in space.

01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:13.940
In physics, was there a dream,

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:16.100
are you also captivated by this search

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:17.860
for the theory of everything

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:21.260
that kind of unlocks the deeper and deeper,

01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:25.300
in the simple, elegant way, the function of our universe?

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:27.300
Do you think they'll be useful for us

01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:30.340
for the actual practical engineering things

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:31.540
that you're working on now?

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.380
It could be.

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:35.220
I mean, I worked at CERN for two summers in undergrad,

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:37.580
and we were looking for supersymmetry,

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:40.100
which was one of these alternatives to the standard model.

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.660
And it was sad because my professors

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:43.260
were getting sadder and sadder

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.540
because they weren't finding it.

01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:47.100
They were excluding what we would call this parameter space

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:50.020
of finding these supersymmetric particles.

01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:53.140
But the search for what that theory of everything could be

01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:55.500
or a grand unified theory that kind of answers

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.340
some of the holes within the standard model of physics

01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:02.300
would presumably kind of unlock a better understanding

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.460
of certain fundamental physical laws

01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.980
that we should be able to build a better understanding

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:10.740
of engineering and day-to-day services from that.

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:13.140
It might not be an immediately obvious thing.

01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:15.140
When we discovered the Higgs boson,

01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.580
I was there at CERN that day.

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:19.820
It was July 4th, 2012 that it was announced.

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:22.220
We all waited like nerds overnight in line

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:23.780
to get into the announcement chamber.

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.940
I had never waited for even like

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.180
a Harry Potter premiere in my life,

01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:28.460
but we waited for this like announcement of the Higgs boson

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.820
to get into the chamber overnight.

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:33.820
But did that immediately translate

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.660
to technology for engineering?

01:32:35.660 --> 01:32:39.180
No, but it's still a really important part

01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:41.500
of our understanding of these fundamental laws of physics.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.140
And so I don't know that it's always immediate,

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.620
but I think it is really critical knowledge

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:45.940
for humanity to seek.

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:50.660
It might just shake up understanding of the world.

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.460
What scares me is it might help us

01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:54.140
create more dangerous weapons.

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.660
And then we'll figure out that great filter situation.

01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:00.100
And I still believe that human compassion

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:03.300
and love is actually the way to defend

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.780
against all these greater and greater

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.700
and more impressive weapons.

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:10.100
Let me ask a weird question

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:12.500
in terms of you disagreeing with others.

01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:15.620
What important idea do you believe is true

01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:20.380
that many others don't agree with you on?

01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.140
Maybe, it's a tough question.

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.780
You might have to think about that one.

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:26.340
But whether it's very specific,

01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.820
like which material to use or something

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:30.700
about a particular project,

01:33:30.700 --> 01:33:35.220
or it could be grand priorities on missions.

01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:38.020
I think one you actually mentioned is interesting is like,

01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.980
the thing we should be looking for is like colonization

01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:45.060
of space versus colonization of planets.

01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:45.900
Meaning like-

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:47.580
Yes, that's probably my best hot take

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.100
that people would disagree with me on

01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:51.860
is life in floating cities

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:54.860
as opposed to life on the surface.

01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:58.340
How do you envision that like spread of humans?

01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:00.740
Because you said at the beginning of the conversation

01:34:00.740 --> 01:34:02.700
something about like scale,

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:05.580
increasing the scale of basically humans in space.

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:09.540
Are they just like in, they're in orbit

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.660
and then they get a little farther and farther out.

01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:15.820
Like do you see this kind of floating cities

01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.500
just getting farther and farther from Earth

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:18.980
that can always kind of return?

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.980
If you look a few centuries from now,

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.260
do you just see us all these like floating cities?

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.100
Like Namibia?

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:25.940
Yeah.

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:30.660
And it just kind of envelops the space around us

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:32.380
in these like neighborhoods.

01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:33.220
Yeah.

01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.780
It's like rural and there's like giant structures

01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:38.980
and there's small pirate structures

01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:40.500
and that kind of stuff. Pirate structures, yeah.

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:43.420
I think low Earth orbit might come to look like that.

01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:45.660
And it's a really interesting regulatory challenge

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:49.180
to make sure that there's some cross purposes.

01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:51.620
So the more cool space cities we have in orbit,

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.780
the more shiny objects in the night sky,

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.340
the worse it is for astronomers

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.100
in a really kind of overly simplified case.

01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.860
So there's some pushback to this like Amoeba-ing

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:05.260
where we just grow kind of incongruously

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:07.980
or indiscriminately as an Amoeba in low Earth orbit.

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:10.660
Beyond that though, I think we'll grow in pockets

01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:12.220
where there are resources.

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:15.860
So we won't just expand around the gravity well of Earth.

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.620
We'll do some development around the moon,

01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.180
some development around asteroids,

01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:21.780
some development around Mars,

01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:23.300
because there'll always be purposes

01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.500
for which we wanna go down to a physical object

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:28.460
and study it or extract something or learn from it.

01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:31.980
But I think we'll grow in fits and starts in pockets.

01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:35.140
Some of the coolest pockets are the gravity balanced pockets

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:37.820
like the Lagrange points, which is where we just sent,

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:41.460
we, not me personally, but NASA just sent James Webb,

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:44.460
the big telescope, I think it's at L2, so.

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:46.500
What's the nice feature about those pockets?

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.460
So it's a stable orbit.

01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:50.540
There are several different Lagrange points.

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:52.380
And so it just requires less energy

01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:55.180
to stay where you're trying to stay.

01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:57.500
Yeah, that's fascinating.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.820
What's also fascinating is the interaction

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:04.820
between nations on that regard, like who owns that?

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.180
Would you say in those floating cities,

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:13.060
do you envision independent governments?

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:14.500
That was gonna be my next answer to you,

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.500
which pushed me harder for a more provocative question

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.340
where I might disagree with other people.

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:22.740
I don't yet have my own opinions fully formed on this,

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.260
but we are trying to figure out right now

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.820
what happens to the moon with all of these

01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:31.180
first come, first served actors just arriving

01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:32.380
and setting precedents

01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:34.460
that might really affect future access.

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:37.260
And one example is property rights.

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.100
We do want companies that have the expertise

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:41.860
to go to the moon and mine stuff

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:45.940
that will help us develop a human settlement there

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:47.140
or a gateway.

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:49.180
But companies need to know generally

01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.780
that they have rights to a certain area

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.140
or that they have some legal right

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:53.740
to sell things that they're getting.

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:55.740
Does that mean we're gonna grant property rights

01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:57.420
on the moon to companies?

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.740
Who has the right to give that right away?

01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.740
So there's a bunch of really kind of gnarly questions

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:03.580
that we have to think about,

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:04.940
which is why I think we need space lawyers.

01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:07.660
Maybe that's the true provocative answers.

01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:09.100
I think we need space lawyers.

01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.940
I mean, yeah, yeah.

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:13.660
I mean, but those questions again, as you said,

01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:17.180
eloquently will help us answer questions about here.

01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:18.020
We hope so.

01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:20.980
It is a little strange.

01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:23.140
I mean, it's obvious, but it's also strange

01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:25.660
if you look at the big picture of it all,

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:28.980
that we draw these like borders around geographical areas

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:30.380
and we say, this is mine.

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:34.740
Like, and then we fight wars over what's mine and not.

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:39.180
It seems like there's possible alternatives,

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:42.900
but also it seems like there needs to be a public ownership

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:43.860
of some parts.

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.860
Something.

01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:47.260
Like, what is it, Central Park in New York?

01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:50.460
Is there something like preserving?

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.380
The commons.

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.220
Yeah, the commons.

01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:54.060
Commons.

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:57.340
That's why we titled the book Into the Anthropocosmos.

01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:59.660
We know it's a long kind of a mouthful,

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:02.340
but this notion of the Anthropocene,

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:04.900
we have a lot of commons problems in humanity.

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.020
How are we treating the earth, global climate change?

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.180
How are we gonna treat and behave in space?

01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.900
How can we be responsible stewards of the space commons?

01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:15.140
And I would love to see an approach to the moon

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:18.340
that is commons based, but it's hard to know

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.980
who would be the protector or the enforcer of that.

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:25.140
And if it's, which it will be probably in the early days,

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:28.100
a lot of companies sort of working on the moon,

01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:30.860
working on Mars, working out in space,

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:33.100
it feels like there still needs to be

01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:37.420
a civilian representation of like the greater effort

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:38.700
or something like that.

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:40.180
Like where there should be a president,

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.860
there should be a democracy of some kind

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:43.900
where people can vote.

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.340
Some representative government.

01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:49.220
Those are all again, the same human questions.

01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:54.020
What advice would you give to a young person today

01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:57.860
thinking about what they wanna do with their life, career?

01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:01.580
So somebody in high school, somebody in college,

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.340
maybe somebody that looks up to the stars

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:07.180
and dreams to one day, take it one way to get to Mars

01:39:07.180 --> 01:39:09.940
or to contribute something to the effort.

01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:12.820
I'd say you should feel empowered

01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:16.100
because it's really the first time in human history

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:19.980
that we're at this cusp of interplanetary civilization.

01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:22.260
And I don't think we're gonna lapse back from it.

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:25.220
So the future is incredibly bright for young people

01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.700
that even younger than you and I

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:30.260
will actually really get a chance to go to Mars for certain.

01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:32.780
The other thing I would say is be open-minded

01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.340
about what your own interests are.

01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:36.460
I don't think you anymore have to be shoehorned

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:39.180
into a particular career to be welcomed

01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.300
into the future of space exploration.

01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.780
If you are an artist and that is your passion,

01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:45.580
but you would love to do space art

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:49.260
or if not space art, use your artistry to communicate

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.900
a feeling or a message about space,

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:54.420
that's a role that we desperately need

01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:56.060
just as much as we need space scientists

01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.900
and space engineers.

01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:00.260
Well, when you look at your own life,

01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:02.860
you're an incredibly accomplished scientist,

01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:06.300
young scientist, and you hopped around

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.980
from physics to aerospace.

01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:11.700
So going from the biggest theoretical ideas

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:14.300
to the biggest practical ideas,

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.820
is there something from your own journey

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:17.780
you can give advice to,

01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:22.380
like how to end up doing incredible research at MIT?

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:26.700
Maybe the role of the university and college

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:29.460
and education and learning, all that kind of stuff.

01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:33.140
I'd say one piece of advice is find really good teammates

01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.300
because I get to be the one that's talking to you,

01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:38.940
but there are 50 graduate students, staff, and faculty

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.660
that are part of my organization back at MIT.

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:43.180
And I'm actually, you guys can't see it on camera,

01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.580
but I'm sitting here with my co-founder and COO,

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.940
Danielle Delat, and that is really what makes

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:52.660
these large-scale challenges for humanity possible,

01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:55.220
is really fantastic teams working together

01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:57.420
to scale more than what I could do alone.

01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:58.660
So I think that that's an important model

01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.420
that we don't talk about enough in academia.

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.380
There's a big push for this lone wolf,

01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:04.780
genius figure in academia,

01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:06.660
but that's certainly not been the case in my life.

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.900
I've had wonderful collaborators

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:10.780
and people that I work with along the team.

01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:12.660
Also cross-disciplinary.

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:14.620
Absolutely, yeah, cross-disciplinary,

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:17.340
interdisciplinary, whatever you wanna call it.

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:19.300
Where do artists come in?

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:20.220
Do you work with artists?

01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:21.060
We do.

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:22.140
We have an arts curator

01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:24.180
on the space exploration initiative side.

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:25.700
She helps make sure partly

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.620
around that communication challenge that we talked about,

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:30.740
that we're not just doing zero-g flights and space missions,

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:34.380
but that we take our artifacts of this sci-fi space future

01:41:34.380 --> 01:41:38.060
to museums and galleries and exhibits.

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:41.780
She pushed me to make sure, her name is Shinglu.

01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:44.460
She pushed me for our first ISS mission.

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:46.740
I was just gathering all the engineering payloads

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:48.620
that I wanted to support for the students to fly,

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:49.700
including my own work.

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:50.660
And she said, you know what?

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:52.940
We should do an open call internationally

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:55.940
for artists to send something to the ISS.

01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:57.780
And we found out it was the first time,

01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:00.100
we were the first ever international open call

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.860
for art to go to the ISS.

01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.260
And that was thanks to Shing

01:42:03.260 --> 01:42:04.620
and artists bringing a perspective

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.020
that I might not have thought about prioritizing.

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:09.060
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.100
So when you look out there,

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.940
it's the flame of human consciousness.

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:15.020
There does seem to be something quite special

01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:16.220
about us humans.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:21.820
First of all, what do you think it is?

01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:23.060
What's consciousness?

01:42:23.060 --> 01:42:25.860
What are we trying to preserve here?

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:32.100
What is it about humans that should be preserved

01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.940
or life here on earth?

01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.940
That what gives you hope to try to expand it out

01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:39.020
farther and farther?

01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:43.180
Like what makes you sad if it was all gone?

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:46.220
I think we're a remarkable species

01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:49.860
that we are aware of our own thoughts.

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:52.740
We are meta aware of our own thoughts and of ourselves.

01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.620
And are able to speak on a podcast

01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:57.060
about our meta awareness about our own thoughts.

01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:57.900
About our own thoughts.

01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:59.460
Yeah, turtles all the way down.

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:03.180
I think that that is a really special gift

01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.780
that we have been given as a species

01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:07.700
and that there's a worth to expanding

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.580
our circles of awareness.

01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:12.180
So we're very aware of as an earth-based species,

01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:14.540
we've become a little bit more aware of the fragility

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.980
of earth and how special a place it is

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:18.140
when we go to the moon and we look back.

01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:21.980
What would it mean for us to have a presence

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:26.220
and our purpose in life as a inter-solar system species

01:43:26.220 --> 01:43:28.580
or eventually an intergalactic species?

01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:32.140
I think it's a really profound opportunity for exploration

01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:34.540
for the sake of exploration.

01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:36.340
A real gift for the human mind.

01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:37.700
Yeah.

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:41.060
If for anything we're curious creatures,

01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:44.220
you see, you do believe we might one day become

01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:46.420
intergalactic civilization.

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.780
Long, long time from now.

01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:50.060
We have a lot of propulsion challenges

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:51.580
to answer to get that far.

01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:53.220
So you have a hope for this.

01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:54.820
Yeah.

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:57.660
Another big ridiculous question building on top of that.

01:43:57.660 --> 01:44:00.300
What do you think is the meaning of life?

01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:03.900
This individual life of ours, your life

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:06.380
that unfortunately has to come to an end

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:08.100
as far as we know for now.

01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:09.260
Yeah.

01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:13.940
And our life here together, is there a why?

01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:18.940
Or do we just kinda like let our curiosity carry us away?

01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:21.620
Oh, interesting.

01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:25.420
Is there a single kind of driving purpose why

01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:28.020
or can it just be curiosity based?

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:30.740
I certainly feel, and this is not the scientist

01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:34.100
in me talking, but just more of like a human soul talking.

01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:38.460
I certainly feel some sense of purpose

01:44:38.460 --> 01:44:39.620
and meaning in my life.

01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:42.260
And there's a version of that that's a very local level

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:43.900
within my family, which is funny

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.940
cause this whole conversation has been big grand

01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:47.100
space exploration themes.

01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:48.140
But you asked me this question

01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:50.100
and my first thought is what really matters to me.

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:53.540
My family, my biological reproducing unit.

01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:57.940
But then there's also another purpose,

01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:59.820
like another version of the meaning in my life

01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:02.460
that is trying to do good things for humanity.

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:05.020
So that sense that we can be individual humans

01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.780
and have our local meaning

01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.660
and we can also be global humans.

01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:10.540
Maybe someday, like the Star Trek utopia

01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:12.500
we'll all be global citizens.

01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.500
I don't wanna sound too naive,

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:17.300
but there is, I think that beauty to a meaning

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:20.140
and a purpose of your life that's bigger than yourself

01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:21.300
working on something that's bigger

01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:23.660
and grander than just yourself.

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.180
The deepest meaning is from

01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:28.060
the local biological reproduction unit.

01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.300
And then it goes to the engineering scientific,

01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:35.260
what is it, corporate like company unit

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:37.420
that can actually produce and compete

01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:38.660
and interact with the world.

01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:41.380
And then there's the giant human unit

01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:44.020
that's struggling with pandemics.

01:45:44.020 --> 01:45:45.220
And commons.

01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:49.260
And together struggling against the forces of nature

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.860
that keeps wanting to kill us.

01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:52.980
Yeah, there'd be nothing like an alien invasion

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:55.020
to unite the planet, we think.

01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:58.020
I can't wait, bring it on aliens.

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:00.700
Listen, your work, you're an incredible communicator,

01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.020
incredible young scientist there.

01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:04.900
It's a huge honor that you would spend your time with me.

01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.740
I can't wait what you do in the future.

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:11.020
And thank you for representing MIT so beautifully,

01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:12.820
so masterfully, you're an incredible person.

01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:13.660
Thank you for talking to me.

01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:14.660
Thank you so much for having me.

01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:15.660
It's been an absolute pleasure.

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.660
It's a great conversation.

01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:19.180
Thanks for listening to this conversation

01:46:19.180 --> 01:46:20.740
with Ariel Ekblah.

01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:21.980

please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:29.300
And now let me leave you with some words from Seneca,

01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.220
the Roman stoic philosopher.

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:36.340
There is no easy way from earth to the stars.

01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:40.420
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
