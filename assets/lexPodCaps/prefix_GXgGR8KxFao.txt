00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The United States has 1,770 nuclear weapons deployed,

00:07.500 --> 00:11.640
meaning those weapons could launch

00:11.640 --> 00:16.220
in as little as 60 seconds and up to a couple minutes.

00:16.220 --> 00:19.360
Some of them on the bombers might take an hour or so.

00:19.360 --> 00:24.360
Russia has 1,674 deployed nuclear weapons.

00:24.940 --> 00:28.100
Same scenario, their weapons systems are on par with ours.

00:29.100 --> 00:33.200
That's not to mention the 12,500 nuclear weapons

00:33.200 --> 00:36.500
amongst the nine nuclear armed nations.

00:36.500 --> 00:41.500
The sucking up into the nuclear stem, 300 mile an hour winds.

00:41.820 --> 00:43.580
You're talking about people miles out

00:43.580 --> 00:45.440
getting sucked up into that step.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.380
When you see the mushroom cloud lex, that would be people,

00:48.380 --> 00:53.380
30, 40 mile wide mushroom cloud blocking out the sun.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.300
And that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning

00:57.300 --> 00:58.140
that follows.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.100
In addition to the launch on warning concept,

01:00.100 --> 01:02.660
there's this other insane concept

01:02.660 --> 01:06.060
called sole presidential authority.

01:06.060 --> 01:09.740
And you might think in a democracy that's impossible, right?

01:09.740 --> 01:11.860
You can't just start a war.

01:11.860 --> 01:13.780
Well, you can just start a nuclear war

01:13.780 --> 01:15.780
if you're the commander in chief,

01:15.780 --> 01:17.620
the president of the United States.

01:17.620 --> 01:20.100
In fact, you're the only one who can do that.

01:20.100 --> 01:23.260
We are one misunderstanding,

01:23.300 --> 01:28.060
one miscalculation away from nuclear Armageddon.

01:28.060 --> 01:31.620
No matter how nuclear war starts,

01:31.620 --> 01:33.860
it ends with everyone dead.

01:36.140 --> 01:39.340
The following is a conversation with Annie Jacobson,

01:39.340 --> 01:42.700
an investigative journalist, Pulitzer Prize finalist,

01:42.700 --> 01:47.700
and author of several amazing books on war, weapons,

01:47.760 --> 01:50.760
government secrecy, and national security,

01:50.800 --> 01:54.760
including the books titled Area 51, Operation Paperclip,

01:54.760 --> 01:58.720
The Pentagon's Brain, Phenomena, Surprise Kill Vanish,

01:58.720 --> 02:02.600
and her new book, Nuclear War.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.840
This is Alex Friedman podcast.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.960
in the description.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.460
And now, dear friends, here's Annie Jacobson.

02:13.480 --> 02:18.480
Let's start with an immensely dark topic, nuclear war.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.360
How many people would a nuclear war

02:21.360 --> 02:24.520
between the United States and Russia kill?

02:24.520 --> 02:29.440
So I'm coming back at you with a very dark answer

02:29.440 --> 02:31.900
and a very big number,

02:33.360 --> 02:36.540
and that number is five billion people.

02:37.460 --> 02:40.920
You go second by second, minute by minute,

02:40.920 --> 02:43.040
hour by hour, what would happen

02:44.240 --> 02:46.520
if the nuclear war started?

02:47.520 --> 02:50.120
So there's a lot of angles

02:50.120 --> 02:52.560
on which I would love to talk to you about this.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.880
At first, how would the deaths happen

02:55.880 --> 02:57.680
in the short term and the long term?

02:59.400 --> 03:03.440
So to start off, the reason I wrote the book

03:03.440 --> 03:08.440
is so that readers like you could see in appalling detail

03:10.360 --> 03:14.600
just how horrific nuclear war would be.

03:14.600 --> 03:18.480
And as you said, second by second, minute by minute,

03:18.480 --> 03:23.480
the book covers nuclear launch to nuclear winter.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.180
I purposely don't get into the politics

03:26.180 --> 03:28.880
that lead up to that or the national security maneuvers

03:28.880 --> 03:30.200
or the posturing or any of that.

03:30.200 --> 03:35.200
I just want people to know nuclear war is insane.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.240
And every source I interviewed for this book

03:39.240 --> 03:43.300
from Secretary of Defense, all retired,

03:43.300 --> 03:45.860
nuclear sub-force commander,

03:45.860 --> 03:48.580
STRATCOM commander, FEMA director,

03:48.580 --> 03:50.500
on and on and on, nuclear weapons engineers,

03:50.500 --> 03:55.500
they all shared with me the common denominator

03:55.860 --> 03:57.540
that nuclear war is insane.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.500
First millions, then tens of millions,

04:01.500 --> 04:04.380
then hundreds of millions of people will die

04:04.380 --> 04:08.100
in the first 72 minutes of a nuclear war.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.140
And then comes nuclear winter

04:10.140 --> 04:13.300
where the billions happen from starvation.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.820
And so the shock power of all of this is meant

04:19.580 --> 04:24.580
for each and every one of us to say, wait, what?

04:25.160 --> 04:28.620
This actually exists behind the veil of national security.

04:28.620 --> 04:31.700
And I don't know, most people do not think

04:31.700 --> 04:34.380
about nuclear war on a daily basis.

04:34.380 --> 04:37.100
And yet hundreds of thousands of people

04:37.100 --> 04:41.180
in the nuclear command and control are at the ready

04:41.180 --> 04:43.500
in the event it happens.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.520
But it doesn't take too many people to start one.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.580
In the words of Richard Garwin,

04:49.580 --> 04:53.320
who was the nuclear weapons engineer

04:53.320 --> 04:56.140
who drew the plans for the Ivy Mike thermonuclear bomb,

04:56.140 --> 05:01.140
the first thermonuclear bomb ever exploded in 1952,

05:02.460 --> 05:05.180
Garwin shared with me his opinion

05:05.180 --> 05:09.700
that all it takes is one nihilistic madman

05:09.700 --> 05:14.180
with a nuclear arsenal to start a nuclear war.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.840
And that's how I begin the scenario.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.220
What are the different ways it could start?

05:19.220 --> 05:21.660
Like literally who presses a button

05:21.660 --> 05:24.020
and what does it take to press a button?

05:24.020 --> 05:28.680
So the way it starts is in space,

05:28.680 --> 05:31.540
meaning the US Defense Department

05:31.540 --> 05:35.380
has a early warning system.

05:35.380 --> 05:37.780
And the system in space is called Sibbers.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.580
It's a constellation of satellites

05:39.580 --> 05:44.060
that is keeping an eye on all of America's enemies

05:44.060 --> 05:49.060
so that the moment an ICBM launches,

05:49.540 --> 05:51.060
the satellite in space,

05:51.060 --> 05:53.900
and I'm talking about one-tenth of the way to the moon,

05:53.900 --> 05:56.860
that's how powerful these satellites are in geosync,

05:57.820 --> 06:02.820
they see the hot rocket exhaust on the ICBM

06:04.340 --> 06:07.380
in a fraction of a second after it launches,

06:07.380 --> 06:08.980
a fraction of a second.

06:09.900 --> 06:14.500
And so there begins this horrifying policy

06:14.500 --> 06:17.060
called launch on warning, right?

06:17.060 --> 06:18.860
And that's the US counterattack,

06:18.860 --> 06:22.700
meaning the reason that the United States

06:22.700 --> 06:27.100
is so ferociously watching for a nuclear launch

06:27.100 --> 06:28.340
somewhere around the globe

06:28.340 --> 06:33.340
is so that the nuclear command and control system

06:33.900 --> 06:36.300
in the US can move into action

06:36.300 --> 06:39.260
to immediately make a counterstrike

06:39.260 --> 06:42.740
because we have that policy, launch on warning,

06:42.740 --> 06:44.100
which is exactly like it says.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.140
It means the United States will not wait

06:47.140 --> 06:50.660
to absorb a nuclear attack.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.380
It will launch nuclear weapons in response

06:53.380 --> 06:57.900
before the bomb actually hits.

06:57.900 --> 07:02.660
So the president, as part of the launch on warning policy,

07:02.660 --> 07:07.020
has six minutes, I guess, can't launch for six minutes,

07:07.020 --> 07:11.420
but at six-minute mark from that first warning,

07:12.340 --> 07:15.700
the president can launch.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.740
And that was one of the most remarkable details

07:19.740 --> 07:21.820
to really nail down for this book

07:21.820 --> 07:23.020
when I was reporting this book

07:23.020 --> 07:25.940
and talking to secretary of defenses, for example,

07:25.940 --> 07:29.140
who are the people who advise the president on this matter.

07:29.140 --> 07:31.220
You say to yourself, wait a minute,

07:31.220 --> 07:32.580
how could that possibly be?

07:32.580 --> 07:34.380
And so let's unpack that.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.740
So in addition to the launch on warning concept,

07:37.740 --> 07:40.300
there's this other insane concept

07:40.300 --> 07:43.660
called sole presidential authority.

07:43.660 --> 07:47.380
And you might think in a democracy, that's impossible.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.500
You can't just start a war.

07:49.540 --> 07:51.420
Well, you can just start a nuclear war

07:51.420 --> 07:53.420
if you're the commander in chief,

07:53.420 --> 07:55.260
the president of the United States.

07:55.260 --> 07:58.460
In fact, you're the only one who can do that.

07:58.460 --> 08:01.340
And we can get into later why that exists.

08:01.340 --> 08:03.140
I was able to get the origin story

08:03.140 --> 08:04.940
of that concept from Los Alamos.

08:04.940 --> 08:07.260
They declassified it for the book.

08:08.940 --> 08:13.940
But the idea behind that is that nuclear war

08:14.100 --> 08:19.100
will unfold so fast, only one person can be in charge,

08:19.140 --> 08:21.420
the president, he asked permission of no one,

08:21.420 --> 08:23.460
not the secretary of defense,

08:23.460 --> 08:26.060
not the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,

08:26.060 --> 08:28.140
not the US Congress.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.300
So built into that is this extraordinary speed

08:31.300 --> 08:33.180
you talk about, the six minute window.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.580
And some people say, oh, that's ridiculous.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.460
How do we know that six minute window?

08:37.460 --> 08:40.740
Well, here's the best sort of, you know,

08:40.740 --> 08:43.220
hitting the nail on the head statement I can give you,

08:43.220 --> 08:47.140
which is in President Reagan's memoirs,

08:47.180 --> 08:50.860
he refers to the six minute window and he says,

08:50.860 --> 08:53.300
he calls it irrational, which it is.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.820
He says, how can anyone make a decision

08:56.820 --> 09:01.220
to launch nuclear weapons based on a blip on a radar scope?

09:01.220 --> 09:04.860
His words, to unleash Armageddon.

09:04.860 --> 09:08.380
And yet that is the reality behind nuclear war.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.580
Just imagine sitting there, one person,

09:13.340 --> 09:15.220
because the president is a human being,

09:16.220 --> 09:19.780
sitting there, just got the warning that Russia launched.

09:20.780 --> 09:22.020
You have six minutes.

09:23.780 --> 09:27.020
You know, I meditate on my immortality every day,

09:27.020 --> 09:31.700
and here you would be sitting and meditating,

09:31.700 --> 09:33.820
contemplating not just your own mortality,

09:33.820 --> 09:37.380
but the mortality of all the people you know, loved ones.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.860
Just imagining, what would be going through my head

09:39.860 --> 09:44.860
is all the people I know and love, like personally.

09:45.660 --> 09:48.940
And knowing that there'll be no more, most likely.

09:48.940 --> 09:51.660
And if they somehow survive,

09:51.660 --> 09:54.460
they will be suffering and will eventually die.

09:55.460 --> 09:59.300
I guess the question that kept coming up is,

09:59.300 --> 10:00.820
how do we stop this?

10:00.820 --> 10:03.660
Is it inevitable that it's going to be escalated

10:03.660 --> 10:06.940
to a full on nuclear war that destroys everything?

10:06.940 --> 10:11.660
And it seems like it will be, it's inevitable.

10:11.660 --> 10:12.900
In the position of the president,

10:12.900 --> 10:16.340
it's almost inevitable that they have to respond.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.340
I mean, one of the things I found shocking

10:18.340 --> 10:22.180
was how little apparently most presidents know

10:22.180 --> 10:24.300
about the responsibility

10:24.300 --> 10:26.140
that literally lays at their feet, right?

10:26.140 --> 10:29.140
So you may think through this six minute window,

10:29.140 --> 10:32.060
I may think through this six minute window,

10:32.060 --> 10:35.460
but what I learned, like for example,

10:35.460 --> 10:38.060
former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta

10:38.060 --> 10:40.380
was really helpful in explaining this to me

10:40.380 --> 10:42.860
because before he was SEC DEF,

10:42.860 --> 10:47.860
he served as the director of the CIA.

10:48.060 --> 10:52.340
And before that, he was the White House Chief of Staff.

10:52.340 --> 10:54.940
And so he has seen these different roles

10:54.940 --> 10:58.380
that have been so close to the president.

10:58.380 --> 11:01.700
But he explained to me that when he was the White House

11:01.700 --> 11:03.700
Chief of Staff for President Clinton,

11:04.620 --> 11:08.700
he noticed how President Clinton didn't want

11:08.700 --> 11:11.300
to ever really deal with the nuclear issue

11:11.300 --> 11:13.780
because he had so many other issues to deal with.

11:15.180 --> 11:20.180
And that only when Panetta became Secretary of Defense,

11:20.460 --> 11:25.220
he told me, did he really realize the weight of all of this

11:25.220 --> 11:28.820
because he knew he would be the person

11:28.820 --> 11:30.620
that the president would turn to

11:31.660 --> 11:35.860
were he to be notified of a nuclear attack.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.780
And by the way, it's the launch on warning.

11:38.460 --> 11:43.460
It's the ballistic missile seen from outer space

11:43.700 --> 11:44.900
by the satellite.

11:44.900 --> 11:49.220
And then there also must be a second confirmation

11:49.220 --> 11:51.540
from a ground radar system.

11:51.540 --> 11:55.300
But in that process, which is just a couple minutes,

11:55.300 --> 11:58.180
everyone is getting ready to notify the president.

11:58.180 --> 12:01.740
And one of the first people that gets notified by NORAD

12:01.740 --> 12:05.660
or by STRATCOM or by NRO,

12:05.660 --> 12:08.460
these different parties that all see

12:08.460 --> 12:10.660
the early warning data,

12:10.660 --> 12:12.260
one of the first people that's notified

12:12.260 --> 12:13.620
is the Secretary of Defense,

12:13.620 --> 12:15.780
as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

12:15.780 --> 12:20.300
because those two together are going to brief the president

12:20.300 --> 12:24.740
about, you know, sir, you have six minutes to decide.

12:25.620 --> 12:30.460
And that's where you realize the immediacy of all of this

12:30.460 --> 12:35.460
is so counter to imagining the scenario

12:36.380 --> 12:39.100
and again, all the presidents come into office,

12:39.100 --> 12:42.820
I have learned understanding the idea of deterrence,

12:42.820 --> 12:45.740
this idea that we have these massive arsenals

12:45.740 --> 12:48.700
of nuclear weapons pointed at one another,

12:48.700 --> 12:53.220
ready to launch so that we never have nuclear war.

12:53.220 --> 12:56.860
But what we're talking about now is what if we did?

12:56.860 --> 12:57.700
What if we did?

12:57.700 --> 13:02.700
And what you've raised is like this really spooky eerie

13:02.940 --> 13:05.260
subtext of the world right now,

13:05.260 --> 13:10.260
because many of the nuclear armed nations

13:10.500 --> 13:14.300
are in direct conflict with other nations.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.940
And for the first time in decades,

13:16.940 --> 13:19.660
nuclear threats are actually coming out

13:19.660 --> 13:22.780
of the mouths of leaders.

13:22.780 --> 13:24.660
This is shocking.

13:24.660 --> 13:29.660
So deterrence, the polite implied assumption

13:30.540 --> 13:32.980
is that nobody will launch.

13:32.980 --> 13:36.180
And if they did, we would launch back

13:36.180 --> 13:38.140
and everybody would be dead.

13:38.140 --> 13:41.140
But that assumption falls apart completely.

13:41.140 --> 13:43.580
The whole philosophy of it falls apart

13:43.580 --> 13:46.140
once the first launch happens.

13:46.140 --> 13:49.260
Then you have six minutes to decide, wait a minute,

13:49.260 --> 13:53.180
are we going to hit back and kill everybody on earth?

13:53.180 --> 13:55.260
Or do we turn the other cheek

13:55.260 --> 13:57.580
in the most horrific way possible?

13:57.580 --> 13:59.220
Well, when nuclear war starts,

13:59.220 --> 14:02.780
there's no like battle for New York or battle for Moscow.

14:02.780 --> 14:06.300
It's just literally, it was called in the Cold War,

14:06.300 --> 14:10.580
push button warfare, but in essence, that is what it is.

14:10.580 --> 14:13.660
Let's get some numbers on the table if you don't mind.

14:13.660 --> 14:16.300
Because when you're saying like, wait a minute,

14:16.300 --> 14:18.900
we're just hoping that it holds.

14:18.900 --> 14:22.340
Let's just talk about Russia and the US,

14:22.340 --> 14:24.460
the arsenals that are literally pointed

14:24.460 --> 14:27.020
at one another right now.

14:27.060 --> 14:32.060
So the United States has 1,770 nuclear weapons deployed.

14:35.220 --> 14:39.380
Meaning those weapons could launch

14:39.380 --> 14:43.940
in as little as 60 seconds and up to a couple minutes.

14:43.940 --> 14:47.100
Some of them on the bombers might take an hour or so.

14:47.100 --> 14:52.100
Russia has 1,674 deployed nuclear weapons.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.840
Same scenario, their weapons systems are on par with ours.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.880
That's not to mention the 12,500 nuclear weapons

15:00.880 --> 15:04.280
amongst the nine nuclear armed nations.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.000
But when you think about those kind of arsenals

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
just between the United States and Russia,

15:10.760 --> 15:12.440
and you realize everything can be launched

15:12.440 --> 15:14.740
in seconds and minutes,

15:14.740 --> 15:18.380
then you realize the madness of mad,

15:18.380 --> 15:22.680
that this idea that no one would launch

15:22.680 --> 15:25.800
because it would assure everyone's destruction.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.560
Yes, but what if someone did?

15:28.560 --> 15:32.320
And in my interviews with scores of top tier

15:32.320 --> 15:34.440
national security advisors,

15:34.440 --> 15:36.200
people who advise the president,

15:36.200 --> 15:38.320
people who are responsible for these decisions

15:38.320 --> 15:39.720
if they had to be made,

15:39.720 --> 15:44.520
every single one of them said it could happen.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.080
They didn't say this would never happen.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.840
And so the idea is worth thinking about

15:52.880 --> 15:57.880
because I believe that it pulls back

15:57.880 --> 16:02.240
the veil on a fundamental security

16:02.240 --> 16:05.680
that if someone were to use a tactical nuclear weapon,

16:05.680 --> 16:08.260
oh well, it's just an escalation.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.520
It's far more than that.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.480
So to you, the use of a tactical nuclear weapon,

16:13.480 --> 16:15.600
maybe you can draw the line between a tactical

16:15.600 --> 16:20.600
and a strategic nuclear weapon that could be a catalyst.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.680
Like that's a very difficult thing to walk back from.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.260
Oh my God, almost certainly.

16:25.260 --> 16:26.840
And again, every person

16:26.840 --> 16:29.040
in the national security environment tells,

16:29.040 --> 16:30.680
we'll agree with that, right?

16:30.680 --> 16:32.240
Certainly on the American side.

16:34.100 --> 16:39.100
Strategic weapons, those are like big weapons systems.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.200
America has a nuclear triad.

16:41.200 --> 16:46.200
We have our ICBMs, which are the silo-based missiles

16:47.560 --> 16:50.360
that have a nuclear warhead in the nose cone.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.680
And they can get from one continent to the other

16:52.680 --> 16:54.880
in roughly 30 minutes.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.720
Then we have our bombers, B-52s and B-2s

16:58.720 --> 17:00.200
that are nuclear capable.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.200
Those take travel time to get to another continent.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.600
Those can also be recalled.

17:05.600 --> 17:09.820
The ICBMs cannot be recalled or redirected once launched.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.240
That one is a particularly terrifying one.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.680
So land launched missiles, rockets with a warhead

17:16.680 --> 17:18.940
can't be recalled.

17:18.940 --> 17:21.660
Cannot be recalled or redirected.

17:21.660 --> 17:25.560
And speaking of how little the presidents generally know

17:25.560 --> 17:27.260
as we were talking a moment ago,

17:27.260 --> 17:30.980
President Reagan in 1983 gave a press conference

17:30.980 --> 17:35.540
where he misstated that submarine launched ballistic missiles

17:35.540 --> 17:36.540
could be recalled.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.340
They cannot be recalled.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.660
So that gives you, here's the guy in charge of the arsenal

17:41.660 --> 17:43.420
if it has to get let loose.

17:43.420 --> 17:47.380
And he doesn't even know that they cannot be recalled.

17:47.380 --> 17:50.700
So this is the kind of misinformation and disinformation.

17:50.700 --> 17:55.700
And UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres

17:56.460 --> 18:00.340
recently said when he was talking about the conflicts

18:00.340 --> 18:02.180
rising around the world, he said,

18:02.180 --> 18:05.420
we are one misunderstanding,

18:05.420 --> 18:10.260
one miscalculation away from nuclear Armageddon.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.740
So just to sort of linger on the previous point

18:13.740 --> 18:15.540
of tactical nukes.

18:15.540 --> 18:19.140
So you're describing strategic nukes, land launched,

18:19.140 --> 18:23.500
bombers, submarine launched, what are tactical nukes?

18:23.500 --> 18:25.020
So that's the triad, right?

18:25.020 --> 18:29.300
And we have the triad and Russia has the triad.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.900
Tactical nuclear weapons are smaller warheads

18:32.900 --> 18:36.540
that were designed to be used in battle.

18:36.540 --> 18:41.180
And that is what Russia is sort of threatening

18:41.180 --> 18:42.360
to use right now.

18:42.360 --> 18:47.000
That is this idea that you would make a decision

18:47.000 --> 18:51.280
on the battlefield in an operational environment

18:51.280 --> 18:53.160
to use a tactical nuclear weapon.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.440
You're just sort of upping the ante.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.200
But the problem is that all treaties are based

18:59.200 --> 19:01.960
on this idea of no nuclear use, right?

19:01.960 --> 19:03.800
You cannot cross that line.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.920
And so what would happen if the line is crossed

19:07.920 --> 19:12.320
is so devastating to even consider.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.720
I think that the conversation is well worth having

19:15.720 --> 19:20.000
among everyone that is in a power of position.

19:22.240 --> 19:25.760
As the UN Secretary General said, this is madness, right?

19:25.760 --> 19:26.640
This is madness.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.320
We must come back from the brink.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.680
We are at the brink.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.800
Can we talk about some other numbers?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.960
So you mentioned the number of warheads.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.240
So land launched.

19:39.240 --> 19:43.240
How long does it take to travel across the ocean

19:44.240 --> 19:46.200
from the United States to Russia,

19:46.200 --> 19:47.400
from Russia to the United States,

19:47.400 --> 19:50.760
from China to the United States?

19:50.760 --> 19:52.240
Approximately how long?

19:52.240 --> 19:56.480
When I was writing an earlier book on DARPA,

19:56.480 --> 19:58.600
the Pentagon Science Agency,

20:00.400 --> 20:04.920
I went to a library down in San Diego

20:04.920 --> 20:08.760
called the Giesel Library to look at Herb York's papers.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.240
Herb York was the first chief scientist

20:11.240 --> 20:14.720
for the Pentagon for DARPA, then called ARPA.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.680
And I had been trying to get the number

20:16.680 --> 20:20.720
from the various agencies to answer,

20:20.720 --> 20:23.240
what is the exact number and how do we know it?

20:23.240 --> 20:24.440
And does it change?

20:24.440 --> 20:27.720
And as technology advances, does that number reduce?

20:27.720 --> 20:28.960
All these kinds of questions,

20:28.960 --> 20:32.280
and no one will answer that question on an official level.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.360
And so much to my surprise,

20:34.360 --> 20:39.360
I found the answer in Herb York's dusty archive of papers.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.920
And this is information that was jealously guarded.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.760
I mean, it's not necessarily classified,

20:46.760 --> 20:48.520
but it certainly wasn't out there.

20:48.520 --> 20:53.240
And I felt like, wow, Herb York left these behind

20:53.240 --> 20:57.200
for someone like me to find, right?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.640
And what the process,

20:59.640 --> 21:02.760
he wanted to know the answer to your question.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.640
And as the guy in charge of it all,

21:04.640 --> 21:07.480
so he hired this group of scientists

21:07.480 --> 21:10.000
who then and still are in many ways,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.760
like the supermen scientists of the Pentagon,

21:13.760 --> 21:15.440
and they're called the Jason scientists.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.200
Many conspiracies about them abound.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.920
I interviewed their founder

21:19.920 --> 21:21.840
and have interviewed many of them.

21:21.840 --> 21:26.200
But they whittled the number down to seconds, okay?

21:27.200 --> 21:29.320
Specifically for Herb York, and it goes like this,

21:29.320 --> 21:32.920
because this is where my jaw dropped and I went, wow, okay?

21:32.920 --> 21:37.360
So 26 minutes and 40 seconds

21:37.360 --> 21:42.360
from a launch pad in the Soviet Union to the East coast.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.000
And it happens in three phases, very simple

21:45.000 --> 21:46.240
and interesting to remember,

21:46.240 --> 21:49.680
because then suddenly all of this makes more sense.

21:49.680 --> 21:54.680
Boost phase, mid-course phase, and then terminal phase, okay?

21:55.360 --> 21:58.360
Boost phase, five minutes.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.240
That's when the rocket launches.

22:00.240 --> 22:03.840
So you just imagine a rocket going off the launch pad

22:03.840 --> 22:05.280
and the fire beneath it.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.920
Again, that's why the satellites can see it, okay?

22:07.920 --> 22:09.200
Now it's becoming visual.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.840
Now it makes sense to me, right?

22:11.840 --> 22:16.160
Five minutes, and that's where the rocket can be tracked.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.040
And then imagine learning, wait a minute,

22:19.040 --> 22:20.040
after five minutes,

22:20.040 --> 22:22.480
the rocket can no longer be seen from space.

22:22.480 --> 22:25.880
The satellite can only see the hot rocket exhaust.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.320
Then the missile enters its mid-course phase.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.360
And that's the ballistic part of it,

22:31.360 --> 22:34.240
where it's kind of flying up

22:34.240 --> 22:38.160
between 500 and 700 miles above the earth

22:38.160 --> 22:40.960
and moving very fast and with the earth

22:41.920 --> 22:44.440
until it gets very close to its target.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.920
And the last 100 seconds are terminal phase.

22:47.920 --> 22:52.240
It's where the warhead re-enters the atmosphere

22:52.240 --> 22:53.600
and detonates.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.080
26 minutes and 40 seconds.

22:58.080 --> 23:02.560
Now, in my scenario, I open with North Korea

23:02.560 --> 23:07.560
launching a one megaton nuclear warhead at Washington, D.C.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.040
That's the nihilistic madman maneuver.

23:11.040 --> 23:13.040
That's the bolt out of the blue attack

23:13.040 --> 23:17.320
that everyone in Washington will tell you they're afraid of.

23:17.320 --> 23:21.920
And North Korea has a little bit different geography.

23:21.920 --> 23:26.920
And so I had MIT Professor Emeritus Ted Postal do the math.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.800
33 minutes from a launch pad in Pyongyang

23:33.080 --> 23:34.880
to the East Coast of the United States.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.000
You get the idea.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.680
It's about 30 minutes.

23:37.680 --> 23:41.000
But hopefully now that allows readers

23:41.000 --> 23:44.040
to suddenly see all this as a real,

23:44.040 --> 23:47.560
you almost see it as poetry,

23:47.560 --> 23:49.200
as terrible as that may sound.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.440
You can visualize it and suddenly it makes sense.

23:52.440 --> 23:55.520
And I think the sense-making part of it

23:55.520 --> 23:57.480
is really what I'm after in this book

23:57.480 --> 23:59.680
because I want people to understand

23:59.680 --> 24:02.720
on the one hand, it's incredibly simple.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.920
It's just the people that have made it so complicated.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.920
But it's one of those things that can change

24:08.920 --> 24:11.880
all of world history in a matter of minutes.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.880
We just don't, as a human civilization,

24:13.880 --> 24:15.200
have experience with that.

24:16.440 --> 24:20.720
But it doesn't mean it'll never happen.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.600
It can happen just like that.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.800
I mean, I think what you're after,

24:26.800 --> 24:28.320
and I couldn't agree more with,

24:28.320 --> 24:33.320
is why is this fundamentally annihilating system,

24:37.760 --> 24:39.720
a system of mass genocide,

24:39.720 --> 24:43.600
as John Rubell in the book refers to it,

24:43.600 --> 24:45.960
why does it still exist?

24:47.120 --> 24:51.600
We've had 75 years since there've been two superpowers

24:51.600 --> 24:52.680
with the nuclear bomb.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.360
So that threat has been there for 75 years

24:56.360 --> 24:59.920
and we have managed to stay alive.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.920
One of the reasons why so many of the sources

25:03.920 --> 25:05.440
in the book agreed to talk to me,

25:05.440 --> 25:08.800
people who had not previously gone on the record

25:08.800 --> 25:09.720
about all of this,

25:09.720 --> 25:14.320
was because they are now approaching the end of their lives.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.080
They spent their lives dedicated

25:17.080 --> 25:20.920
to preventing nuclear World War III.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.280
And they'll be the first people to tell you

25:23.280 --> 25:27.280
we're closer to this as a reality than ever before.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.240
And so the only bright side of any of this

25:30.240 --> 25:33.760
is that the answer lies most definitely in communication.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.800
So there's a million other questions here.

25:37.800 --> 25:41.560
I think the details are fascinating

25:41.560 --> 25:42.960
and important to understand.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.920
So one, you also say nuclear submarines.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.840
You mentioned about 30 minutes, 26, 33 minutes,

25:51.840 --> 25:54.360
but with nuclear submarines,

25:54.360 --> 25:56.800
that number can be much, much lower.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.320
So how long does it take for a warhead missile

26:00.320 --> 26:03.080
to reach the east coast of the United States

26:03.080 --> 26:04.240
from a submarine?

26:04.240 --> 26:06.280
Just when you thought it was really bad

26:06.280 --> 26:08.480
and then you kind of realize about the submarines.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.480
I mean, the submarines are what are called

26:10.480 --> 26:12.120
second strike capacity, right?

26:12.120 --> 26:16.360
And submarines were described to me this way.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.600
They are as dangerous to civilization.

26:18.600 --> 26:22.640
And let me say a nuclear armed nuclear powered submarine

26:22.640 --> 26:27.640
is as dangerous to civilization as an asteroid, okay?

26:27.640 --> 26:29.320
They are unstoppable.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.560
They are unlocatable.

26:31.560 --> 26:35.960
The former chief of the nuclear submarine forces,

26:35.960 --> 26:40.120
Admiral Michael Connor told me it's easier to find

26:40.120 --> 26:44.240
a grapefruit sized object in space

26:44.240 --> 26:47.440
than a submarine under the sea, okay?

26:47.480 --> 26:50.520
So these things are like hell machines

26:51.840 --> 26:55.160
and they're moving around throughout the oceans,

26:55.160 --> 26:59.680
ours, Russia's, China's, maybe North Korea's constantly.

26:59.680 --> 27:03.160
And we now know they're sneaking up to the east

27:03.160 --> 27:04.880
and west coast of the United States

27:04.880 --> 27:06.440
within a couple hundred miles.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.280
How do we know that?

27:07.280 --> 27:08.240
Why do we know that?

27:08.240 --> 27:11.200
Well, I found a document inside of a budget

27:12.520 --> 27:14.600
that the Defense Department was going to Congress

27:14.600 --> 27:17.920
for more money recently and showed maps

27:17.920 --> 27:20.400
of precisely where these submarines,

27:20.400 --> 27:23.000
how close they were getting to the Eastern seaboard.

27:23.000 --> 27:23.840
So wait, wait, wait.

27:23.840 --> 27:27.440
So nuclear subs are getting within 200 miles?

27:27.440 --> 27:28.680
Couple hundred miles, yes.

27:28.680 --> 27:29.880
They weren't precise on the number,

27:29.880 --> 27:32.360
but when you look at the map, yep.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.440
And that's when you're talking about under 10 minutes

27:35.440 --> 27:37.400
from launch to strike.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.640
Undetectable.

27:38.640 --> 27:39.760
And they're undetectable.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.000
The map making is done after the fact

27:42.000 --> 27:45.080
because of a lot of underwater surveillance systems

27:45.080 --> 27:46.560
that we have.

27:46.560 --> 27:51.560
But in real time, you cannot find a nuclear submarine.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.720
And just the way a submarine launches

27:54.720 --> 27:57.240
goes 150 feet below the surface

27:57.240 --> 27:59.760
to launch its ballistic missile.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.320
I mean, it comes out of the missile tube

28:02.320 --> 28:07.400
and with enough thrust that the thrusters,

28:07.400 --> 28:10.320
they ignite outside the water

28:10.320 --> 28:12.160
and then they move into boost.

28:12.160 --> 28:15.400
And so the technology involved is just stunning

28:15.400 --> 28:16.240
and shocking.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.680
And again, trillions of dollars spent

28:18.680 --> 28:21.360
so that we never have a nuclear war.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.880
But my God, what if we did?

28:25.520 --> 28:28.520
As you write, they're called the handmaidens

28:28.520 --> 28:30.080
of the apocalypse.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.200
What a terrifying label.

28:33.200 --> 28:38.200
I mean, one of the things you also write about,

28:38.760 --> 28:40.640
so for the land launched ones,

28:41.760 --> 28:43.640
they're presumably underground.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.960
So the silos, how long does it take to go

28:46.960 --> 28:49.000
from like pressing the button

28:49.000 --> 28:52.080
to them emerging from underground for launch?

28:52.080 --> 28:55.480
And is that part detectable or it's only the heat?

28:55.480 --> 28:57.160
So what's interesting about the silos,

28:57.160 --> 28:59.520
America has 400 silos, right?

28:59.520 --> 29:04.080
We've had more, but we have 400 and they're underground.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.000
And they're called minutemen, right?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.840
After the revolutionary war heroes.

29:08.840 --> 29:12.120
But the sort of joke in Washington

29:12.120 --> 29:14.240
is they're not called minutemen for nothing

29:14.240 --> 29:16.840
because they can launch in one minute, right?

29:16.840 --> 29:21.000
So the president orders the launch of the ICBMs,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.240
ICBM stands for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.440
He orders the launch and they launch 60 seconds later.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.520
And then they take 30 some odd minutes

29:30.520 --> 29:32.640
to get to where they're going.

29:32.640 --> 29:37.520
The submarines take about 14 or 15 minutes

29:37.520 --> 29:40.800
from the presidential, from the launch command

29:40.800 --> 29:43.040
to actually launching.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.800
And that has to do, I surmise,

29:44.800 --> 29:48.440
with the location of the submarine, its depth.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.680
Some of these things are so highly classified.

29:51.680 --> 29:55.680
And others, other details are shockingly available

29:55.680 --> 29:58.560
if you look deep enough or if you ask enough questions

29:58.560 --> 30:01.840
and you can go from one document to the next to the next

30:01.840 --> 30:03.520
and really find these answers.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.280
Not to ask top secret questions,

30:05.280 --> 30:09.120
but to what degree do you think the Russians know

30:09.120 --> 30:12.720
the locations of the silos in the US and vice versa?

30:12.720 --> 30:15.320
Lex, you and I can find the location

30:15.320 --> 30:16.800
of every silo right now.

30:16.800 --> 30:17.640
They're all there.

30:17.640 --> 30:20.040
And before they were there on Google,

30:20.040 --> 30:22.800
they were there in maps because we're a democracy

30:22.800 --> 30:25.000
and we make these things known, okay?

30:25.000 --> 30:29.680
Now what's tricky is that Russia and North Korea

30:29.680 --> 30:33.680
rely upon what are called road mobile launchers, right?

30:33.680 --> 30:36.760
So Russia has a lot of underground silos.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.880
All of the scenario takes you through

30:38.880 --> 30:41.480
these different facilities that really do exist.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.920
And they're all sourced with how many weapons they have

30:43.920 --> 30:46.280
and their launch procedures and whatnot.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.960
But in addition to having underground silos,

30:49.960 --> 30:52.800
they have road mobile launchers.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.480
And that means you just have one of these giant ICBMs

30:56.480 --> 31:00.040
on a 22 axle truck

31:00.040 --> 31:04.280
that can move stealthily around the country

31:04.280 --> 31:08.480
so that it can't be targeted by the US Defense Department.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.200
We don't have those in America

31:10.200 --> 31:13.480
because presumably the average American

31:13.480 --> 31:17.360
isn't gonna go for like the ICBM road mobile launcher

31:17.360 --> 31:21.160
driving down the street in your town or city,

31:22.560 --> 31:25.240
which is why the Defense Department will justify

31:25.240 --> 31:28.360
we need the second strike capacity capability,

31:28.360 --> 31:30.320
the submarines, right?

31:30.320 --> 31:35.320
Because the wonky stuff that is worth looking into

31:35.640 --> 31:38.840
as if you really dig the book and are like, wait a minute,

31:38.840 --> 31:41.400
it's all footnoted where you can learn more

31:41.400 --> 31:45.000
about how these systems have changed over time

31:45.920 --> 31:48.120
and why more than anything,

31:48.120 --> 31:52.680
it's very difficult to get out of this catch-22 conundrum

31:52.680 --> 31:56.520
that we need nuclear weapons to keep us safe.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.480
That is the real enigma

31:59.480 --> 32:03.120
because the other guys have them, right?

32:03.120 --> 32:05.680
And the other guys have sort of more sinister ways

32:05.680 --> 32:08.840
of using them or at least that's what the nomenclature

32:08.840 --> 32:10.920
out of the Pentagon will always be

32:10.920 --> 32:14.320
when anyone tries to say we just need to really think

32:14.320 --> 32:16.520
about full disarmament.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.240
You've written about intelligence agencies.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.840
How good are the intelligence agencies on this?

32:21.840 --> 32:26.400
How much does CIA know about the Russian launch sites

32:26.400 --> 32:31.400
and capabilities and command and control procedures

32:31.880 --> 32:33.840
and all this and vice versa?

32:33.840 --> 32:36.200
I mean, all of this because it's decades old

32:36.200 --> 32:38.640
is really well known.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.960
If you go to the Federation of American Scientists,

32:41.960 --> 32:45.120
they have a team led by a guy called Hans Christensen

32:45.120 --> 32:47.880
who runs what's called the Nuclear Notebook.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.720
And he and his team every year are keeping track

32:50.720 --> 32:54.080
of this number of warheads on these number of weapons systems.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.720
And because of the treaties,

32:55.720 --> 32:58.040
the different signatories to the treaty

32:58.040 --> 32:59.920
all report these numbers.

32:59.920 --> 33:02.840
And of course the different intelligence community,

33:02.840 --> 33:07.560
people are keeping track of what's being revealed honestly

33:07.560 --> 33:11.440
and reported with transparency and what is being hidden.

33:11.440 --> 33:15.480
The real issue is the new systems

33:15.480 --> 33:17.600
that Russia is working on right now.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.200
And that will lead us,

33:20.200 --> 33:22.960
we are kind of moving into an era

33:22.960 --> 33:27.960
whereby the threat of actually having new weapons systems

33:27.960 --> 33:31.560
that are nuclear capable is very real

33:31.560 --> 33:35.280
because of the escalating tensions around the world.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.840
And that's where the CIA I would guess

33:36.840 --> 33:38.640
is doing most of its work right now.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.640
So most of your research is kind of looking at

33:41.640 --> 33:44.560
the older versions of the system

33:44.560 --> 33:46.920
and presumably there's potentially

33:46.960 --> 33:50.160
a secret development of new ones, hopefully not.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.520
Which violates treaties.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.640
So yes, that is where the intelligence agencies,

33:54.640 --> 33:58.080
but at a point it's overkill,

33:58.080 --> 34:00.880
literally and figuratively, right?

34:00.880 --> 34:03.440
People are up in arms about these hypersonic weapons.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.600
Well, we have a hypersonic weapons program,

34:06.600 --> 34:08.760
Falcon, Google Blackswift, right?

34:08.760 --> 34:10.440
This is Lockheed's doing,

34:11.440 --> 34:16.440
DARPA exists to create the vast weapons systems

34:17.320 --> 34:18.400
of the future.

34:18.400 --> 34:19.680
That is its job.

34:19.680 --> 34:23.600
It has been doing that since its creation in 1957.

34:23.600 --> 34:28.440
I would never believe that we aren't ahead of everyone.

34:28.440 --> 34:32.680
Call me over-informed or naive, one or the other.

34:32.680 --> 34:35.080
That would be my position because DARPA works

34:35.080 --> 34:36.880
from the chicken or the egg scenario.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.600
Like once you learn about something,

34:40.600 --> 34:44.480
once you learn Russia's created this typhoon submarine,

34:44.480 --> 34:47.600
which may or may not be viable,

34:47.600 --> 34:50.560
it's too late if you don't already have one.

34:50.560 --> 34:52.800
We'll probably talk about DARPA a little bit.

34:54.720 --> 34:56.920
One of the things that makes me sad about Lockheed,

34:56.920 --> 34:59.320
many things make me sad about Lockheed,

34:59.320 --> 35:02.160
but one of the things is because it's very top secret,

35:02.160 --> 35:05.160
you can't show off all the incredible engineering

35:05.160 --> 35:06.280
going on there.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.400
The other thing that's more philosophical,

35:08.400 --> 35:13.400
DARPA also, is that war seems to stimulate most of our,

35:14.080 --> 35:16.960
not most, but a large percent

35:16.960 --> 35:19.920
of our exciting innovation in engineering.

35:21.560 --> 35:25.160
But that's also the pragmatic fact of life on Earth

35:25.160 --> 35:30.160
is that the risk of annihilation is a great motivator

35:30.960 --> 35:34.360
for innovation, for engineering and so on.

35:34.360 --> 35:39.360
But yes, I would not discount the United States

35:39.760 --> 35:42.960
in its ability to build the weapons of the future,

35:42.960 --> 35:45.880
nuclear included, again, terrifying.

35:47.200 --> 35:50.440
Can you tell me about the nuclear football as it's called?

35:50.440 --> 35:53.160
I think Americans are familiar with the football,

35:53.160 --> 35:56.600
at least anyone who follows national security concepts,

35:56.600 --> 35:59.440
because it's a satchel, it's a leather satchel

35:59.440 --> 36:04.120
that is always with a military aid in secret service,

36:05.000 --> 36:06.640
that's the mill aid.

36:06.640 --> 36:11.440
And he's trailing around the president 24, seven,

36:11.440 --> 36:15.440
365 days a year, and also the vice president, by the way,

36:15.440 --> 36:18.640
with the ability to launch nuclear war

36:18.640 --> 36:22.080
in that six minute window all the time, okay?

36:23.560 --> 36:27.120
That is also called the football,

36:27.120 --> 36:29.360
and it's always with the president.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.720
To report this part of the book,

36:30.720 --> 36:32.760
I interviewed a lot of people in the secret service

36:32.760 --> 36:35.160
that are with the president and talk about this,

36:35.160 --> 36:37.800
and the director of the secret service,

36:37.800 --> 36:41.040
a guy called Lou Merletti, told me a story

36:41.040 --> 36:45.200
that I just really found fascinating.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.680
He was also in charge of the president's detail,

36:47.680 --> 36:49.760
President Clinton this was,

36:49.760 --> 36:51.760
before he was director of the secret service.

36:51.760 --> 36:55.200
And he told me the story about how, he said,

36:55.200 --> 37:00.080
the football is with the president at all times, period, okay?

37:00.080 --> 37:02.920
They were traveling to Syria,

37:02.920 --> 37:06.000
and Clinton was meeting with President Assad,

37:06.000 --> 37:09.400
and they got into an elevator,

37:10.480 --> 37:11.760
Clinton and the secret service team,

37:11.760 --> 37:14.600
and one of Assad's guys was like, no,

37:14.600 --> 37:16.160
like about the mill aid.

37:16.160 --> 37:19.040
And Lou said, it was like a standoff,

37:19.040 --> 37:22.840
because there was no way they were not going

37:22.840 --> 37:26.960
to have the president with his football in an elevator.

37:26.960 --> 37:31.280
And it kind of sums up, for me anyways,

37:32.320 --> 37:35.320
you realize what goes into every single

37:35.320 --> 37:37.160
one of these decisions.

37:37.160 --> 37:40.800
You realize the massive system of systems

37:40.800 --> 37:45.760
behind every item you might just see in passing

37:45.760 --> 37:46.920
and glancing on the news,

37:46.920 --> 37:49.120
as you see the mill aid carrying that satchel.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.160
Well, what's in that satchel?

37:51.160 --> 37:56.000
I really dug into that to report this book.

37:56.000 --> 37:56.840
What is in that satchel?

37:56.840 --> 37:59.760
Okay, so, well, okay, first of all,

37:59.760 --> 38:01.160
that is, you know, people always say,

38:01.160 --> 38:02.840
it's incredibly classified.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.600
I mean, people talk about UFOs.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.280
It's incredibly, I mean, come on guys,

38:07.280 --> 38:08.960
that is nothing burger, right?

38:08.960 --> 38:10.920
You wanna know what's really classified,

38:10.920 --> 38:12.320
what's in that football, right?

38:12.320 --> 38:13.640
What's in that satchel?

38:13.640 --> 38:17.400
But the PED, Presidential Emergency Action Directives,

38:17.400 --> 38:19.840
right, those have never been leaked.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.640
No one knows what they are.

38:21.640 --> 38:24.520
What we do know from one of the mill aides

38:24.520 --> 38:26.920
who spoke on the record, a guy called Buzz Patterson,

38:26.920 --> 38:30.200
he describes the president's orders, right?

38:30.200 --> 38:32.200
So if a nuclear war has begun,

38:32.200 --> 38:36.120
if the president has been told there are nuclear missiles,

38:36.120 --> 38:38.000
one or more coming at the United States,

38:38.000 --> 38:41.320
you have to launch in a counter attack, right?

38:41.320 --> 38:42.640
The red clock is ticking,

38:42.640 --> 38:46.000
you have to get the blue impact clock ticking.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.800
He needs to look at this list to decide

38:49.840 --> 38:54.840
what targets to strike and what weapon systems to use.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.760
And that is what is on, according to Buzz Patterson,

38:58.760 --> 39:02.560
a piece of like sort of laminated plastic.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.440
He described it like a Denny's menu.

39:05.440 --> 39:10.440
And from that menu, the president chooses targets

39:10.840 --> 39:12.680
and chooses weapon systems.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.240
And it's probably super old school,

39:16.280 --> 39:20.080
like all top secret systems are

39:20.080 --> 39:21.880
because they have to be tested over and over

39:21.880 --> 39:23.360
and over and over and over.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.880
Yes, and it's non-digital.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.000
Non-digital.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.320
It might literally be a Denny's menu from hell.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.320
Right, and there's a, meanwhile,

39:31.320 --> 39:33.960
I learned this only in reporting the book.

39:33.960 --> 39:37.440
There is a identical black book

39:37.440 --> 39:42.440
inside the STRATCOM bunker in Nebraska, okay?

39:42.640 --> 39:45.600
So let me, three command bunkers are involved

39:45.840 --> 39:47.320
when nuclear war begins, right?

39:47.320 --> 39:49.520
There's the bunker beneath the Pentagon,

39:49.520 --> 39:53.920
which is called the National Military Command Center, okay?

39:53.920 --> 39:57.240
Then there is the bunker beneath Cheyenne Mountain,

39:57.240 --> 40:00.160
which everyone has, many people have heard of

40:00.160 --> 40:02.280
because it's been made famous in movies, right?

40:02.280 --> 40:04.480
That is a very real bunker.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.160
And then there is a third bunker

40:06.160 --> 40:08.560
which people are not so familiar with,

40:08.560 --> 40:13.280
which is the bunker beneath strategic command in Nebraska.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.600
And so it's described to me this way.

40:15.600 --> 40:20.240
The Pentagon bunker is the beating heart.

40:20.240 --> 40:24.040
The Cheyenne Mountain bunker is the brains.

40:24.040 --> 40:27.400
And the STRATCOM bunker is the muscle.

40:28.440 --> 40:32.520
The STRATCOM commander will receive word

40:32.520 --> 40:34.960
from the president, launch orders,

40:34.960 --> 40:39.960
and then directs the 150,000 people beneath him

40:40.720 --> 40:45.520
what to do, okay, from the bunker beneath STRATCOM.

40:45.520 --> 40:48.880
That's before he gets the orders,

40:48.880 --> 40:50.240
then he has to run out of the building

40:50.240 --> 40:53.200
and jump onto what's called the doomsday plane.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.360
We'll get into that in a minute.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.720
Let me just finish the, I mean, but again,

40:56.720 --> 41:00.240
these are the details, this is like,

41:00.240 --> 41:05.120
these are the systematic sequential details

41:05.120 --> 41:07.720
that happen in seconds and minutes.

41:07.720 --> 41:11.880
And reporting them, I never cease to be amazed

41:11.880 --> 41:15.680
by what a system it is.

41:15.680 --> 41:19.640
A follows B, it's just numerical, right?

41:19.640 --> 41:22.160
Yeah, but as we discuss this procedure,

41:22.160 --> 41:25.200
each individual person that follows that procedure

41:25.200 --> 41:27.480
might lose the big picture of the whole thing.

41:29.480 --> 41:34.480
I mean, especially when you realize what is happening,

41:35.040 --> 41:38.720
that almost out of fear, you just follow the steps.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.680
Yep, or okay, so imagine this,

41:40.680 --> 41:43.040
imagine being the president and you got that six minute win.

41:43.040 --> 41:48.040
You have to, you're looking at your list of strike options.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.800
You're being briefed by your chairman

41:49.800 --> 41:52.560
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and your SACDF.

41:52.560 --> 41:56.880
And this other really spooky detail,

41:56.880 --> 41:59.240
in the STRATCOM bunker,

42:00.160 --> 42:02.600
in addition to the nuclear strike advisor

42:02.600 --> 42:05.200
who can answer very specific questions

42:05.200 --> 42:06.400
if the president's like, wait a minute,

42:06.400 --> 42:08.640
why are we striking that, not that.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.320
There's also a weather officer.

42:11.320 --> 42:14.280
And this is the kind of human detail

42:14.280 --> 42:15.800
that kept me up at night.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.400
Because that weather officer is in charge

42:19.400 --> 42:23.760
of explaining to the president really fast

42:23.760 --> 42:26.120
how many people are going to die

42:26.120 --> 42:30.680
and how many people are going to die

42:30.680 --> 42:35.680
in minutes, weeks, months, and years from radiation fallout.

42:38.440 --> 42:41.040
Because a lot of that has to do with the weather system.

42:41.040 --> 42:41.880
Yes.

42:43.280 --> 42:47.200
Yes, and so these kinds of, the humanness,

42:48.360 --> 42:53.280
balanced out with the mechanization of it all,

42:54.280 --> 42:58.080
is, it's just really grotesque.

42:58.080 --> 43:01.240
So the doomsday plane from STRATCOM,

43:01.240 --> 43:03.480
what's that, where's it going?

43:03.480 --> 43:04.320
It's on it.

43:04.320 --> 43:06.200
Right, okay, ready?

43:06.200 --> 43:07.600
It's gonna fly in circles.

43:08.600 --> 43:09.760
That's where it's going.

43:09.760 --> 43:14.360
It's flying in circles around the United States of America

43:14.360 --> 43:19.360
so that nuclear weapons can be launched from the air

43:21.760 --> 43:24.880
after the ground systems are taken out

43:24.880 --> 43:26.520
by the incoming ICBMs

43:26.520 --> 43:30.520
or the incoming submarine-launched ballistic missiles.

43:30.520 --> 43:33.560
This has been in play since the 50s.

43:36.040 --> 43:40.080
These are the contingency plans for when nuclear war happens.

43:40.080 --> 43:44.040
So again, going back to this absurd paradox,

43:44.040 --> 43:46.360
nuclear war will never happen.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.200
You know, mutual assured destruction,

43:48.200 --> 43:49.880
that is why deterrence will hold.

43:49.880 --> 43:54.880
Well, I found a talk that the deputy director of STRATCOM

43:55.680 --> 43:58.240
gave to a very close-knit group

43:58.240 --> 44:00.640
where he said, yes, deterrence will hold,

44:00.640 --> 44:03.560
but if it fails, everything unravels.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.960
And think about that word, unravels, right?

44:05.960 --> 44:08.240
And the unraveling is, you know,

44:08.240 --> 44:09.760
the doomsday plane launches.

44:09.760 --> 44:12.800
The STRATCOM commander jumps in, he's in that plane,

44:12.800 --> 44:15.040
he's flying around the United States,

44:15.040 --> 44:17.480
and he's making decisions

44:17.480 --> 44:20.080
because the Pentagon's been taken out.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.320
At 9-11, by the way, Bush was in the doomsday plane.

44:25.320 --> 44:29.120
And Bush had to make decisions quickly,

44:29.120 --> 44:31.200
but not so quickly, not as quickly

44:31.200 --> 44:33.040
as he would have needed to have done

44:33.040 --> 44:35.240
if there's a nuclear launch.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.640
I mean- Six minutes.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.440
It basically happens in three acts.

44:39.440 --> 44:44.440
There's the first 24 minutes, the next 24 minutes,

44:44.920 --> 44:47.320
and the last 24 minutes.

44:48.160 --> 44:51.240
And that is the reality of nuclear weapons.

44:54.240 --> 44:58.960
What is the interceptor capabilities of the United States?

44:58.960 --> 45:01.480
How many nuclear missiles can be stopped?

45:02.440 --> 45:06.920
I was at a dinner party with a very informed person, right?

45:06.920 --> 45:10.680
Like somebody who really, you know, should have known this.

45:10.680 --> 45:14.280
And this is when I was considering writing

45:14.280 --> 45:17.160
and reporting this book, and he said to me,

45:17.160 --> 45:20.000
oh, Annie, that would never happen

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
because of our powerful interceptor system, okay?

45:25.080 --> 45:26.080
Well, he's wrong.

45:26.080 --> 45:28.920
Let me tell you about our powerful interceptor system.

45:28.920 --> 45:32.880
First of all, we have 44 interceptor missiles,

45:32.880 --> 45:35.040
total period, full stop.

45:35.040 --> 45:38.320
Let me repeat, 44, okay?

45:38.320 --> 45:41.880
Earlier, we were talking about Russia's 1,670

45:43.760 --> 45:45.320
deployed nuclear weapons.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.960
How are those 44 interceptor missiles gonna work, right?

45:52.360 --> 45:55.840
And they also have a success rate of around 50%.

45:55.840 --> 45:58.040
So they work 50% of the time.

45:58.040 --> 46:01.840
There are 40 of them in Alaska, and there are four of them

46:02.760 --> 46:06.080
at Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara, okay?

46:06.080 --> 46:09.320
And they are responsible at about nine minutes

46:09.320 --> 46:11.440
into the scenario, right?

46:11.440 --> 46:16.000
After the ICBM has finished that five-minute boost phase

46:16.000 --> 46:19.400
we talked about, now it's in mid-course phase,

46:19.400 --> 46:24.080
and the ground radar systems have identified,

46:24.080 --> 46:28.560
yes, this is an incoming ICBM.

46:28.560 --> 46:32.280
And now the interceptor missiles have to launch, right?

46:32.280 --> 46:34.760
It's essentially shooting a missile with a missile.

46:34.760 --> 46:38.640
Inside the interceptor, which is just a big giant rocket,

46:38.640 --> 46:42.240
in its nose cone, it has what's called

46:42.240 --> 46:47.240
the aptly named exo-atmospheric kill vehicle, okay?

46:48.000 --> 46:49.520
There's no explosives in that thing.

46:49.520 --> 46:54.520
It's literally just going to take out the warhead,

46:55.040 --> 46:57.600
ideally, with force.

46:57.600 --> 47:01.240
So one of them is going like Mach 20.

47:01.240 --> 47:05.280
I mean, the speeds at which these two moving objects

47:05.280 --> 47:08.720
hurtling through space are going is astonishing.

47:08.720 --> 47:12.720
And the fact that interception is even possible

47:12.720 --> 47:14.760
is really remarkable, but it's only possible

47:14.760 --> 47:15.960
50% of the time.

47:16.880 --> 47:19.560
Is it possible that we only know about 44,

47:19.560 --> 47:20.720
but there could be a lot more?

47:20.720 --> 47:22.680
No, impossible.

47:22.680 --> 47:24.320
That I would be willing to bet.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.800
And how well-tested are these interceptors?

47:26.800 --> 47:28.440
Well, that's where we get the success rate

47:28.440 --> 47:30.800
that's around 50% because of the tests, right?

47:30.800 --> 47:33.280
And actually, the interceptor program is,

47:33.280 --> 47:34.120
are you ready for this?

47:34.120 --> 47:37.720
It's on strategic pause, right, right now,

47:37.720 --> 47:39.840
meaning the interceptor missiles are there,

47:39.840 --> 47:43.120
but developing them and making them more effective

47:43.120 --> 47:46.200
is on strategic pause because they can't be made

47:46.200 --> 47:47.680
more effective, right?

47:47.680 --> 47:51.000
People have these fantasies that we have a system

47:51.000 --> 47:54.360
like the Iron Dome, and they see this in current events,

47:54.360 --> 47:56.800
and they're like, oh, our interceptors would do that.

47:56.800 --> 47:58.560
It's just simply not true.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.960
Why can't an Iron Dome-like system be constructed

48:01.960 --> 48:03.880
for nuclear warheads?

48:03.880 --> 48:06.400
We have systems I write about called the THAAD system,

48:06.400 --> 48:08.640
which is ground-based, and then the Aegis system,

48:08.640 --> 48:11.640
which is on vessels, and these are great

48:11.640 --> 48:15.600
at shooting down some rockets,

48:15.600 --> 48:19.280
but they can only shoot them sort of one at a time.

48:19.280 --> 48:22.280
You cannot shoot the mother load as it's coming in.

48:22.280 --> 48:23.960
Those are the smaller systems, right,

48:23.960 --> 48:25.560
the tactical nuclear weapons.

48:25.560 --> 48:29.000
And by the way, our THAAD systems are all deployed overseas,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.240
and our Aegis systems are all out at sea.

48:31.280 --> 48:34.280
And again, reporting that, I was like, wait, what?

48:34.280 --> 48:35.760
You have to really hunker down.

48:35.760 --> 48:37.400
Are we sure about this?

48:37.400 --> 48:39.160
People really don't wanna believe this.

48:39.160 --> 48:40.520
It's an actual fact.

48:40.520 --> 48:44.960
After 9-11, Congress considered putting Aegis missiles

48:44.960 --> 48:46.960
and maybe even THAAD systems along the west coast

48:46.960 --> 48:49.880
of the United States to specifically deal with the threats

48:49.880 --> 48:52.040
against nuclear-armed North Korea,

48:52.040 --> 48:53.640
but it hasn't done so yet.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.000
And again, you have to ask yourself,

48:55.000 --> 48:57.320
wait a minute, this is insanity.

48:57.320 --> 49:01.360
One nuclear weapon gets by any of these systems,

49:01.360 --> 49:04.000
and it's full-out nuclear warfare.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.440
So that's not the solution.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.640
More nuclear weapons is not the solution.

49:10.720 --> 49:14.200
I'm looking for a hopeful thing here about North Korea.

49:14.200 --> 49:17.600
How many deployed nuclear warheads does North Korea have?

49:17.600 --> 49:21.960
So does the current system, as we described it,

49:21.960 --> 49:24.280
the interceptors and so on have a hope

49:24.280 --> 49:27.880
against the North Korean attack,

49:27.880 --> 49:31.040
the one that you mentioned people are worried about?

49:31.040 --> 49:35.480
So North Korea has 50,

49:35.480 --> 49:39.040
let's say 50 nuclear weapons right now.

49:39.040 --> 49:42.680
Some NGOs put it at more than 100.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.080
It's impossible to know

49:44.080 --> 49:47.080
because North Korea's nuclear weapons program

49:47.080 --> 49:48.840
has no transparency.

49:48.840 --> 49:51.760
They're the only nuclear-armed nation

49:51.760 --> 49:55.600
that doesn't announce when they do a ballistic missile test.

49:55.600 --> 49:56.720
Everyone else does.

49:56.720 --> 49:59.640
No one wants to start a nuclear war by accident, right?

49:59.640 --> 50:02.080
So if Russia's gonna launch an ICBM, they tell us.

50:02.080 --> 50:05.360
If we're gonna launch one, and I'm talking test runs here,

50:05.360 --> 50:09.640
with a dummy warhead, we tell them, not North Korea.

50:09.640 --> 50:11.240
That's a fact, okay?

50:11.240 --> 50:15.120
So we're constantly up against the fear of North Korea.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.880
In this scenario, I have the incoming

50:17.920 --> 50:22.160
North Korean one-megaton weapon coming in,

50:22.160 --> 50:26.760
and the interceptor system tries to shoot it down.

50:26.760 --> 50:29.880
So there's not enough time, and this, by the way,

50:29.880 --> 50:33.320
I ran through by all generals from the Pentagon

50:33.320 --> 50:36.760
who run these scenarios for NORAD, right?

50:36.760 --> 50:38.680
And confirmed all of this as fact.

50:38.680 --> 50:42.040
This is the situation, right?

50:42.040 --> 50:47.040
So in the scenario, I have the nuclear ICBM coming in,

50:47.080 --> 50:49.880
the interceptor missiles try to shoot down the warhead.

50:49.880 --> 50:54.880
The capability is not like what's called shoot and look.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.360
There's not enough time to go like,

50:57.360 --> 50:59.360
and we're gonna try to get it, we missed it.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.880
Okay, let's go for another one.

51:00.880 --> 51:03.680
So you have to go, poof, poof, poof, poof, right?

51:03.680 --> 51:06.120
So in my scenario, we fire off four,

51:06.120 --> 51:08.800
which is about what I was told would one to four,

51:08.800 --> 51:10.120
because you're worried about the next one

51:10.120 --> 51:11.160
that's gonna come in.

51:11.160 --> 51:15.920
You're gonna use up 10% of your interceptor force on one,

51:15.920 --> 51:18.520
and all four miss, and that's totally plausible.

51:19.640 --> 51:20.480
Right.

51:22.040 --> 51:25.760
How likely are mistakes, accidents, false alarms

51:25.760 --> 51:28.600
taken as real, all this kind of stuff in this picture?

51:28.600 --> 51:31.640
So like you've, we've kind of assumed

51:31.640 --> 51:33.680
the detection works correctly.

51:35.200 --> 51:37.600
How likely is it possible, like anywhere?

51:37.600 --> 51:41.200
You described this long chain of events that can happen.

51:41.200 --> 51:43.080
How possible is it just to make a mistake,

51:43.080 --> 51:45.760
a stupid human mistake along the way?

51:46.600 --> 51:50.200
There've been at least six known, like absolute,

51:50.200 --> 51:54.400
like oh my God, close calls, how thank God

51:54.400 --> 51:56.400
this happened type scenarios.

51:56.400 --> 52:01.400
One was described to me with an actual personal participant,

52:01.640 --> 52:05.640
secretary, former secretary of defense, Bill Perry, right?

52:05.640 --> 52:09.160
And he described what happened to him in 1979.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.720
He was not yet secretary of defense.

52:10.720 --> 52:13.880
He was the deputy director of the research and engineering,

52:13.880 --> 52:15.800
which is like a big job at the Pentagon.

52:15.800 --> 52:19.920
And it was, the night watch fell on him essentially, right?

52:19.920 --> 52:22.160
And he gets this call in the middle of the night.

52:22.160 --> 52:27.160
He's told that Russia has launched not just ICBMs,

52:28.040 --> 52:30.240
but submarine-launched ballistic missiles

52:30.240 --> 52:32.320
are coming at the United States.

52:32.320 --> 52:35.280
And he is about to notify the president

52:35.280 --> 52:37.440
that the six-minute window has to begin

52:37.440 --> 52:41.360
when he learns it was a mistake.

52:41.360 --> 52:44.480
The mistake was that there was a training tape

52:44.480 --> 52:47.800
with a nuclear war scenario, right?

52:47.800 --> 52:49.400
We haven't even begun to talk about

52:49.400 --> 52:51.680
the nuclear war scenarios that the Pentagon runs.

52:51.680 --> 52:56.680
An actual VHS training tape had been incorrectly inserted

52:57.600 --> 53:00.440
into a system at the Pentagon.

53:00.440 --> 53:05.440
And so this nuclear launch showed up at that bunker

53:06.000 --> 53:09.960
beneath the Pentagon and at the bunker beneath STRATCOM

53:09.960 --> 53:13.320
because they're connected as being real.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.880
And then it was like, oh, whoops,

53:14.880 --> 53:17.600
it's actually a simulation test tape.

53:17.600 --> 53:21.720
And Perry described to me what that was like,

53:21.720 --> 53:25.920
the pause in his spirit and his mind and his heart

53:25.920 --> 53:28.960
when he realized I'm about to have to tell the president

53:28.960 --> 53:30.680
that he needs to launch nuclear weapons.

53:30.680 --> 53:32.280
And he learned just in the neck of time

53:32.280 --> 53:33.800
that it was an error.

53:33.800 --> 53:36.040
And that's one of five examples.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.480
Can you speak to maybe,

53:38.480 --> 53:41.640
is there any more color to the feelings he was feeling?

53:41.640 --> 53:43.360
Like, what's your sense?

53:43.360 --> 53:46.400
And given all the experts you've talked to,

53:46.400 --> 53:51.400
what can be said about the seconds

53:51.920 --> 53:56.920
that one feels once finding out that a launch has happened

53:56.920 --> 54:00.080
even if that information is false information?

54:00.080 --> 54:00.920
For me personally,

54:00.920 --> 54:03.480
that's the only firsthand story that I ever heard

54:03.480 --> 54:05.960
because it's so rare and it's so unique.

54:06.840 --> 54:10.320
And most people in the national security system,

54:10.320 --> 54:12.240
at least in the past,

54:12.240 --> 54:15.080
have been loathed to talk about any of this, right?

54:15.080 --> 54:18.280
It's like the sacred oath, it's taboo.

54:18.280 --> 54:22.680
It's taboo to go against the system of systems

54:22.680 --> 54:26.400
that is making sure nuclear war never happens.

54:26.400 --> 54:30.200
Bill Perry was one of the first people who did this.

54:30.200 --> 54:32.680
And a lot of it, I believe,

54:32.680 --> 54:35.880
at least in my lengthy conversations with him

54:36.800 --> 54:38.720
we had a lot of Zoom calls over COVID

54:38.720 --> 54:40.000
when I began reporting this.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.600
And he had a lot to do with me feeling

54:43.600 --> 54:48.040
like I could write this book from a human point of view

54:48.040 --> 54:51.000
and not just from the mechanized systems

54:51.000 --> 54:53.680
because, and I only lightly touch upon this

54:53.680 --> 54:56.120
because it's such a fast sweeping scenario,

54:56.120 --> 54:57.880
but Perry, for example,

54:57.880 --> 55:02.120
spent his whole life dedicated to building weapons of war

55:03.080 --> 55:06.960
only later in life to realize this is madness.

55:06.960 --> 55:11.880
And he shared with me that it was that idea

55:11.880 --> 55:15.000
about one's grandchildren inheriting

55:15.960 --> 55:20.960
these nuclear arsenals and the lack of wisdom

55:23.880 --> 55:27.560
that comes with their origin stories, right?

55:27.560 --> 55:30.040
When you're involved in it in the ground up,

55:30.080 --> 55:32.760
apparently it has,

55:33.960 --> 55:37.560
perhaps you're a different kind of steward of these systems

55:37.560 --> 55:40.480
than if you just inherit them

55:40.480 --> 55:44.080
and they are pages in a manual.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.800
People forget.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.640
You mentioned the kind of nuclear war scenarios

55:49.640 --> 55:51.200
that the Pentagon runs.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.520
I'd love to, what do you know about those?

55:53.520 --> 55:56.480
I mean, again, they are very classified, right?

55:56.480 --> 55:59.080
I mean, it was interesting coming across

55:59.800 --> 56:02.080
levels of classification I didn't even know existed,

56:02.080 --> 56:04.120
like ECI, for example,

56:04.120 --> 56:08.120
is exceptionally controlled information, right?

56:09.080 --> 56:13.320
But the Pentagon nuclear war gaming scenarios,

56:13.320 --> 56:15.280
they're almost all still classified.

56:15.280 --> 56:17.960
One of them was declassified recently,

56:17.960 --> 56:19.800
if you can call it that.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.600
I show an image of it in the book

56:21.600 --> 56:26.800
and it's just basically almost entirely redacted

56:26.800 --> 56:28.720
and then there'll be a date

56:29.360 --> 56:31.360
or it'll say like phase one.

56:31.360 --> 56:33.840
And that one was called proud profit.

56:33.840 --> 56:36.880
But what was incredible about the declassification process

56:36.880 --> 56:39.440
of that is it allowed a couple of people

56:39.440 --> 56:41.600
who were there to talk about it, okay?

56:41.600 --> 56:43.600
And that's why we have that information.

56:43.600 --> 56:45.720
And I write about proud profit in the book

56:45.720 --> 56:48.680
because it was super significant in many ways.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.280
One, it was happening right,

56:51.280 --> 56:56.280
in 1983 it was an insane moment in nuclear arsenals.

56:56.440 --> 57:00.400
There were 60,000 nuclear weapons.

57:00.400 --> 57:02.080
Right now there's 12,500.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.280
So we've come a long way, baby, right?

57:04.280 --> 57:06.840
In terms of disarmament, but there were 60,000.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.880
And by the way, that was not the ultimate high.

57:08.880 --> 57:12.240
The ultimate high was 70,000, okay?

57:12.240 --> 57:13.800
This is insane.

57:13.800 --> 57:16.000
And Ronald Reagan was president

57:16.000 --> 57:19.280
and he orders this war game called proud profit.

57:19.280 --> 57:24.000
And everyone that mattered was involved.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.640
They were running the war game scenarios.

57:25.680 --> 57:28.640
And what we learned from his declassification

57:28.640 --> 57:31.600
is that no matter how nuclear war starts,

57:31.600 --> 57:33.000
there was a bunch of different scenarios

57:33.000 --> 57:35.600
with NATO involved, without NATO,

57:35.600 --> 57:37.600
with all different scenarios.

57:37.600 --> 57:42.600
No matter how nuclear war starts, it ends in Armageddon.

57:43.520 --> 57:45.760
It ends with everyone dead.

57:47.040 --> 57:52.040
I mean, this is shocking when you think about that,

57:52.840 --> 57:55.560
coupled with the idea that all that has been done

57:56.440 --> 57:58.160
in the 40-some-odd years since is,

57:58.160 --> 58:01.960
okay, let's just really lean in even harder

58:01.960 --> 58:06.600
to this theoretical phenomena of deterrence.

58:06.600 --> 58:07.640
Because that's all it is.

58:07.640 --> 58:09.920
It's just a statement, Lex.

58:09.920 --> 58:13.160
Like, deterrence will hold.

58:13.160 --> 58:15.600
Okay, well, what if it doesn't?

58:16.520 --> 58:19.520
Well, we know from proud profit what happens if it doesn't.

58:20.520 --> 58:24.360
Almost always, so there's no mechanisms in the human mind

58:24.360 --> 58:26.400
and the human soul that stops it.

58:26.400 --> 58:29.000
In the governments they've created,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.480
they just keep, the procedure escalates always.

58:31.480 --> 58:35.080
I mean, here's a crazy nomenclature jargon thing for you.

58:35.080 --> 58:36.000
Ready?

58:36.000 --> 58:37.960
Escalate to de-escalate.

58:37.960 --> 58:39.520
That's what comes out of it.

58:39.520 --> 58:41.120
Think about what I just said.

58:41.120 --> 58:42.880
Escalate to de-escalate.

58:42.880 --> 58:45.600
Okay, so someone strikes you with a nuclear weapon,

58:45.600 --> 58:47.560
you're gonna escalate it, right?

58:47.560 --> 58:50.320
General Hyten recently said he was STRATCOM commander,

58:50.320 --> 58:54.200
you know, he was sort of saber-rattling with North Korea

58:55.040 --> 58:55.880
during COVID and he said,

58:55.880 --> 58:58.360
they need to know if they launch one nuclear weapon,

58:58.360 --> 58:59.320
we launch one.

58:59.320 --> 59:01.920
If they launch two, we launch two.

59:01.920 --> 59:03.240
But it's actually more than that.

59:03.240 --> 59:06.480
They launch one, we launch 80, okay?

59:06.480 --> 59:09.240
That's called escalate to de-escalate.

59:09.240 --> 59:12.160
Like, pound the you-know-what out of them

59:12.160 --> 59:13.600
to get them to stop.

59:14.720 --> 59:19.640
But, I mean, there is, to make a case for that,

59:19.640 --> 59:23.560
there is a reason to the madness

59:23.600 --> 59:28.600
because you want to threaten this gigantic response.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.320
But when it comes to it, the seconds before,

59:32.320 --> 59:36.720
there is still a probability that you'll pull back.

59:36.720 --> 59:40.400
Which brings us to the most terrifying facts

59:40.400 --> 59:42.040
that I learned in all of that.

59:42.040 --> 59:46.480
And that has to do with errors, right?

59:46.480 --> 59:49.200
Not errors of like we spoke about a minute ago

59:49.200 --> 59:51.200
with a simulation test tape.

59:51.200 --> 59:55.360
I'm talking about if one new, one madman,

59:55.360 --> 59:57.920
one nihilistic madman were to launch a nuclear weapon

59:57.920 --> 59:59.520
as I write in this scenario.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.400
And we needed to escalate to de-escalate.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.640
We needed to send nuclear weapons at, let's say,

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.360
North Korea as I do in my scenario.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:13.240
Well, what is completely unknown to 98% of the planet

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.240
is that not only do the Russians

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.120
have a very flawed satellite system,

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.080
so that they cannot interpret what is happening properly,

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.840
but there is an absolutely existential flaw in the system

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.200
which Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta confirmed with me,

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.200
which is that our ICBMs do not have enough range.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:43.760
If we launch a counterattack against, say, North Korea,

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.720
our ICBMs must fly over Russia.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.560
They must fly over Russia.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:56.560
So imagine saying, oh, no, no, these 82 warheads

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.920
that are gonna actually strike the Northern Korean Peninsula

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.320
are not coming for you, Russia, our adversary right now

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.280
that we're sort of saber-rattling with.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.440
Just trust us.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.960
And that is where nuclear war unfolds into Armageddon.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.400
And that hole in national security is shocking.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.240
And as Panetta told me, no one wants to discuss it.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.400
And if one nuclear weapon does reach its target,

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.440
I presume communication breaks down completely.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.120
Or like there's a high risk of breakdown of communication.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.640
Well, let's back up.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.280
We are both presumptuous to assume

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.720
that communication could even happen prior to.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.400
And let me give you a very specific example.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.760
During the Ukraine War, okay,

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.440
if perhaps you remember, I think it was in November of 2022,

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.600
news reports erroneously stated that a Russian rocket,

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.680
a Russian missile had hit Poland, a NATO country, right?

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.400
It turned out to be a mistake, but for several hours,

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.320
this was actually the information

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.120
that was all over the news, breaking news, okay?

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.960
36 hours later, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:19.720
General Mark Milley, gave a press conference

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.800
and talked about this and admitted

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.640
that he could not reach his Russian counterpart

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:27.920
during those 36 hours.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.400
He could not reach him.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.400
How are you going to not have an absolute Armageddon-like

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.880
Armageddon-like furor with nuclear weapons in the air

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.040
if people can't get on the phone during a ground war?

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.640
I'd like to believe that there's people in major nations

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.960
that don't give a damn about the bullshit of politics

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.640
and can always just pick up the phone,

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.120
sort of very close to the top, but not at the very top,

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.000
and just cut through the bullshit of it

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.960
in situations like this.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.040
I hope that's true.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.320
I doubt it is, and let me tell you why.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.440
Most, and neither you nor I are political

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440
from what I gather, right?

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.160
So I just write about POTUS, President of the United States.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.120
I don't, you have no idea what my politics are

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.200
because they shouldn't matter.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.640
No one should be for nuclear war

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.120
or no one should be for national insecurity.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.280
Yes, you want to have a strong nation,

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.480
but once you get into politics,

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.600
then you're talking about sycophants.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.600
And the more a political leader becomes divisive,

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.600
becomes polemic, the more his platform

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.840
is predicated on hating the other side,

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.640
either within his own country

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.680
or with alleged enemy nations,

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.680
the more you surround yourself as we see

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.360
in the current day with sycophants,

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.080
with people who will tell you

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.000
not only what they think you want to hear,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.600
but will help them to hold onto power.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.880
So you don't have wise decision-makers.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.720
Long gone are the days where we had presidents

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.720
who had advisors on both sides of the aisle.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.840
That's really important because you want to,

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.240
you want to have differing opinions,

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.280
but as things become more viperous,

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.880
both here in the United States

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.600
and in nuclear-armed nations,

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.720
all bets are off at whether your advisors

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.360
are going to give you good advice.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.000
Who are the people around the president

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.160
of the United States that give advice

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.400
in this six-minute window?

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.960
How many of them, just to,

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.520
maybe you could speak to the detail of that,

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:52.080
but also to the spirit of the way they see the world.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.680
How many of them are warmongers?

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.680
How many of them are kind of big picture,

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.360
peace, humanity type of thinkers?

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.560
Well, again, we're talking about that six-minute window.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.720
So it's not exactly like you can,

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.400
let me put a pot of coffee on

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.520
and really tell me what you think.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:07.920
And we can strategize here, right?

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.440
You have your SECDEF and your chairman,

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.240
maybe the vice chairman.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.160
And okay, we haven't even begun to talk about the fact

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.080
that at the same time,

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:20.440
these advisors also have a parallel concern,

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.280
and that's called continuity of government, okay?

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.000
So while they're trying to advise

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.680
on the nuclear counter-strike

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.560
in response to the incoming nuclear missile,

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.440
they have to be thinking,

01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.040
how are we gonna keep the government functioning

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.280
when the missiles start hitting,

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.880
when the bombs start going off?

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:44.880
And that is about getting yourself out of the Pentagon,

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.560
let's say, getting yourself to one of these nuclear bunkers

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.440
that I write about at length in the book.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.440
So how much can you ask of a human, right?

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.680
Because it comes down to a human.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.800
Secretary of Defense is a human.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.920
And imagine that job while trying to advise the president.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.440
And then there's also a really interesting term,

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.520
which I learned about called jamming the president,

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.800
which is often understood in Washington

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.400
that the military advisors would,

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.720
we don't know if this is legit,

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.480
we've never seen it put to the test,

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.920
but jamming the president means the military advisors

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.680
are gonna push for a really aggressive

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.640
counter-attack immediately.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:27.960
And again, you're the president

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.160
who's not really been paying attention to this

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.080
because he has many other things to deal with.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.760
Speed is not conducive to wisdom.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.240
Can you speak to the jamming the president

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.240
so your sense is the advisors would, by default,

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.320
be pushing for aggressive counter-attack?

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.000
That is a term in sort of the national security,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.600
nuclear command and control, historical documentation.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.600
That many of the people that you might call

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.360
the more dovish type people are worried about,

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.640
that the more hawkish people are going to,

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.640
the military advisors are gonna be jamming the president

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:15.640
to make these decisions about which targets, not if,

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.640
but what. Right, which targets.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.280
The argument will be about which targets, not about if.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:20.120
Yes.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:25.120
I hope that even the warmongers would, at this moment,

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.360
because what underlies the idea of you wanting to go to war?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.480
It's power, it's like wanting to destroy the enemy

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.920
and be the big kid on the block,

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.680
but with nuclear war, it just feels like that falls apart.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.160
Do you think warmongers actually believe

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.640
they can win a nuclear war?

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.840
Well, you've raised a really important question

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.960
that we look to the historical record for that answer,

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.280
because astonishingly, all of this began,

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.280
like when Russia first got the bomb in 1949,

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.480
the powers that be, and I write about them in the book

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.840
as in a setup for the moment of launch, right?

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.280
It's called how we got here, right?

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:14.560
And you see, and I cite declassified documents

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.800
from some of these early meetings

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:22.200
where nuclear war plans were being laid out.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.640
And absolutely, back in the 1950s,

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.200
the generals and the admirals

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.600
that were running the nuclear command and control system

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.600
believed that we could fight and win a nuclear war

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.840
despite hundreds of millions of people dying.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.840
This was the prevailing thought.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:45.840
And only over time did the kind of concept

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:50.840
come into play that no, we can never have a nuclear war.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.760
It's the famous Gorbachev and Reagan joint statement.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.040
A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:05.040
But before that, many people believed that it could be won,

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.520
and they were preparing for that.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.440
Not to be political and not to be ageist,

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.640
but do cognitive abilities and all that kind of stuff

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.080
come into play here?

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.560
So if so much is riding on the president,

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.120
is there tests that are conducted?

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.240
Is there regular training procedures on the president

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.280
that you're aware of?

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.960
Do you know?

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.280
I don't think that has anything to do with ageism.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.720
I think it has to do with, I think it's an earnest question,

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:37.320
a really powerful one.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:41.400
And if people were to ask that question of themselves

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.600
or their sort of dinner party guests

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.320
or their family around the dinner table guests,

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.160
you might come to a real good conclusion

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.120
about how bad our political system is

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.400
and how bad our presidential candidates are.

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:57.000
Because why on earth there would be two candidates,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.920
one of whom has cognitive problems

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.120
and the other of whom has judgment problems?

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.080
These are the two biggest issues with a nuclear launch,

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.840
judgment and cognition.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.840
And so where's the young-ish, thoughtful,

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.480
forward-looking, wise, dedicated civil servant

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.080
running for president?

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:30.080
I know that sounds fantastical, but I wish it weren't.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.640
So that's one of the things that you really think about

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.720
when voting for president is this scenario

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.920
that we've been describing, these six minutes.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.960
Imagine the man or woman sitting there six minutes

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.480
waiting for the pot of coffee.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.800
But I think about that issue with any war, right?

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.840
I mean, prior to writing Nuclear War a Scenario,

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.840
I previously wrote six books on military

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.880
and intelligence programs designed to prevent nuclear war.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.800
And I believe the president as commander in chief

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:18.240
should be of the highest character possible

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.720
because the programs, the wars that we have fought

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.200
since World War II have all been,

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.440
how many octogenarian sources have I interviewed?

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.840
I'm talking about Nobel laureates and weapons designer

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.240
and spy pilots and engineers in general.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:38.880
They've all said to me with great pride,

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.840
we prevented World War III, nuclear World War III, right?

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.680
And that, but that idea that the commander in chief

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:49.840
and everyone within the national security apparatus

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:53.320
should be making really good decisions about war.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.040
It's the oldest cliche in the world that,

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.320
the wars are fought by the young kids.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.800
And that is, it's not a cliche, it's true.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.120
And so the character part about the president

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:08.200
should be in play whether we're thinking about nuclear war

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.200
or any war, in my opinion.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.400
Well, I agree with you, first of all,

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.720
but it feels like when nuclear war,

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:21.880
one person becomes like exponentially more important.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.240
With regular war, the decision to go to war or not,

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.840
advisors start mattering more, there's judgment issues.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:35.840
You can start to make arguments for sort of more leeway

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.440
in terms of what kind of people we elect.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:41.360
It seems like with nuclear war, there's no leeway.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.680
It's like one person can resist this,

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.320
the jamming, the president force, the warmongers,

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.320
the use, like all the calculation involved in considering

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.200
what are the errors, the mistakes,

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.520
the missiles flying over Russia,

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.480
the full dynamics of the geopolitics going on in the world.

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.320
Consider all of humanity, the history of humanity,

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:11.320
the future of humanity, all of it just loaded in

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.760
to make a decision.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.440
Then it becomes much more important

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:17.680
that your cognitive abilities are strong

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:22.680
and your judgment abilities against powerful, wise people,

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.640
just as a human being are strong.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.720
I think that's something to really, really consider

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.240
when you vote for president.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.760
But to which degree is it really on the president

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.720
versus to the people advising?

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.560
Oh no, it's on the president.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.920
The president has to make the call

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.120
and that six-minute window happens so fast.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.320
I mean, the president is gonna be being moved

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.200
for part of that time.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.400
The Secret Service is gonna be up against STRATCOM,

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.960
STRATCOM saying we need the launch orders

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.600
and the Secret Service is gonna be saying

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.360
we need to move the president.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.160
So it's not as much that he's delegating the issues.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:03.720
It's more like the issue is being postponed

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.560
because there is only one issue

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.040
for the president to say these targets,

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.640
for him to choose from the Denny's-like menu,

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.040
okay, this is what we're gonna go with.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.920
And then this astonishing thing happens.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:19.040
The president takes out his wallet.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:22.800
He has a card in it that's colloquially called the biscuit.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.280
And that card with the codes matches up

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:30.040
an item in the briefcase in the football

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.560
that then is received by an officer

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.160
underneath the Pentagon in that bunker.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:39.360
It's a call and response, Lex.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.120
It's like alpha, zeta, right?

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.080
That's it.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.680
And then back so that the individual in the bunker

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.680
realizes they are getting the command from the president.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.080
And then that order is passed to STRATCOM.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:03.280
And STRATCOM, the commander of STRATCOM,

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.640
and I interviewed a former commander of STRATCOM,

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.440
commander of STRATCOM then follows orders,

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.440
which is he delivers the launch orders to the nuclear triad.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.800
And what's done is done.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.960
What would you do if you were the commander of STRATCOM

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.960
in that situation?

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.800
What would you do?

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.560
Because I think my gut reaction right now,

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:28.200
if you just throw me in there, I would refuse orders.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.040
Okay, so good question.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:35.480
I asked that exact question to one of my

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.680
very helpful sources on the book, Dr. Glenn McDuff,

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.680
who is at Los Alamos and who for a while was the classified,

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.280
they have a museum that's classified within the lab.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.440
And he was the historian in charge of it, right?

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.800
So he's a nuclear weapons engineer.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.000
He worked on Star Wars during the Reagan era

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.680
and he does a lot having to do

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.560
with the history of Los Alamos.

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.560
And by the way, the Oppenheimer movie really,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.560
because I've reported on nuclear weapons

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.240
for 12 years now and Oppenheimer movie had a very,

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:16.200
to me, positive impact on Los Alamos' transparency

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.680
with people like me.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.600
They had a real willingness to share information.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.120
I think before perhaps they were on their heels

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.280
feeling they needed to be on the defensive,

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.080
but now they're much more forthcoming.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:30.080
They were super helpful.

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.960
I can tell you the origin story of the football,

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.320
which they declassified for the book.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.200
But I asked this question to Dr. Glenn McDuff, right?

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.120
Like in a different manner, I said,

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.480
is there a chance that the STRATCOM commander

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:47.680
would defy orders?

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.800
And he said, Annie, you have a better chance

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.960
winning Powerball.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.640
Why do you think?

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.120
What's his intuition behind that?

01:16:58.120 --> 01:17:00.920
You don't wind up a STRATCOM commander

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.880
unless you are someone who follows orders.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.000
You follow orders.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.760
You don't think there's a deep humanity there?

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.920
Because his intuition is about everything we know so far,

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.160
but this situation has never happened

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:18.320
in the history of Earth.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.400
Well, this is true.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.920
All right, so you're raising a really tricky,

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.400
interesting conundrum here because during COVID,

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.920
when President Trump and the leader of North Korea

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:34.440
were kind of locked in various relationships

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.880
with one another, good, bad, threatening,

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.600
non-threatening, friendly, just bananas, you might say,

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.720
like not presidential behavior.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:47.160
If you were someone watching C-SPAN like I do,

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:50.800
nerding out on what STRATCOM was actually saying

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.440
about all this, you noticed that STRATCOM commanders

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.840
were speaking out publicly to Congress

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.000
more so than I had ever seen before.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.520
And this issue came up.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.120
Would you defy presidential order?

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.240
So the caveat I would say to Macduff's answer

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:13.080
of easier to win the power ball, right,

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.120
is that if the commander of STRATCOM interpreted

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:27.960
the president's behavior to be unreliable,

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:32.960
to be non-presidential, then dot, dot, dot.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.920
But now you're into some really radical territory.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:45.280
Well, I mean, fundamentally, it feels like,

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.640
just looking at all the presidents of the United States

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.640
in my lifetime, it feels like none of them

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.400
are qualified for this six minutes.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:00.400
So like I could see, you know, I could see

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.440
as being the commander of STRATCOM being like this guy,

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.200
like basically respecting no president.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.760
I know you're supposed to be the commander in chief,

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.840
but in this situation, saying like, I mean, everybody,

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:17.840
Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, if I was the commander

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.960
of STRATCOM, I'd be like, what does this guy know

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.180
about any of this?

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.920
I would defy orders.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.160
I mean, in this situation, when the future

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.840
of human civilization hangs in the balance,

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.840
I mean, to be the person that says yes, launch,

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.000
no matter what, I just can't see a human being on earth

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.440
being able to do that in the United States of America.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.440
That's a hell of a decision.

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.680
Like, this is it, that's it.

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.380
Well, but now you've raised a great important,

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.580
you know, presentation essentially,

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.880
because what you're saying is people be aware, right?

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.120
Be aware of like why you're voting

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.680
or why certain individuals are being escalated

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.380
to even being able to run for president.

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.300
What does that mean?

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.940
Why are people in America not more involved as citizens?

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:12.620
Do we have a responsibility for that?

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:15.540
Because you've opened up the door for people to understand,

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.220
okay, the ultimate thing is the nuclear launch decision.

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:22.820
So if a person can't be trusted with that, you know,

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:26.300
everything spiral, everything unravels from there.

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:28.860
Also, I wanna look up who's the commander of STRATCOM now.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.860
Speaking of which, you've interviewed a lot of experts

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:39.860
for this book, is there some commonalities about the way,

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.900
you've talked about this a little bit,

01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:45.540
but in the way they see this whole situation,

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:50.540
what like scares them the most about this whole system

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.300
and the whole possibility of nuclear war?

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.260
I first learned about nuclear weapons

01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:00.180
from a guy called Al O'Donnell,

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.620
who appears in my earlier books,

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:05.780
because I interviewed him for over a period

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:06.780
of four and a half years,

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:11.780
because he was an engineer who actually wired nuclear bombs

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.380
in the 1950s.

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:16.780
He was a member of the Manhattan Project in 1946,

01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:19.020
worked on Operation Crossroads,

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:24.020
the first explosions of nuclear bombs after the war ended,

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:29.060
after World War II ended and went on to arm, wire and fire

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:34.900
186 out of the 200 some odd atmospheric nuclear tests

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:39.060
that the United States did before this was banned.

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:44.060
And so I learned from him the power of these weapons, right?

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:49.540
And I learned from him this very almost nationalistic idea

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.780
about how important it was to have nuclear weapons.

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.940
And while I learned a lot about his human side,

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:58.580
I also saw the side of him

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.980
that was very Cold War warrior, right?

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:04.860
And then, so he was kind of the first and then,

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.580
I don't know, there's been a hundred people

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:09.500
that have been directly involved in nuclear weapons

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.980
along the way, Billy Waugh,

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:15.980
who was my subject of my main sort of central figure

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:18.620
in a book I wrote about the CIA's paramilitary

01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:21.380
called Surprise Kill Vanish.

01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:26.380
And Waugh halo jumped a tactical nuclear weapon

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:30.340
into the Nevada test site with a small team,

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.540
almost unknown to anyone, right?

01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:34.220
Only recently declassified.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.300
And so his position was like,

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:40.420
tactical nuclear weapons may end up being used.

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:44.380
So I'm trying to speak here to the scope

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:48.220
of different people I have interviewed over the years,

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:49.180
right?

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:52.740
And what has happened is as I've gotten closer

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.700
to the present day, you know, in arrears,

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:59.260
there seems to be a growing movement

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.500
from some of these Cold Warriors off the position

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:07.500
of nuclear weapons make us great and strong

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:12.860
toward something must be done to reduce this threat.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:18.500
How much do you know in the same way

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.220
that you know about the United States,

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:22.220
how much do you know about the Russian side,

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:27.220
maybe the Chinese side, Indian, Pakistan, all of this,

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.820
like how their thinking differs perhaps?

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.540
Yes, well, for that you want to go to the experts, right?

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:38.540
So for Russia, for example, there's a lot of people

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:43.540
in, for Russia, for example, there's a guy called

01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:48.620
Pavel Podvig, who is probably the West's top expert

01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:53.220
on Russian nuclear forces.

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:55.900
He works in parallel with the UN.

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:59.180
He also studied in Moscow and he interviewed.

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:01.260
So my information comes from him, right?

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:05.020
Like you do all the footwork to know what questions to ask.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:08.540
And then you take the very specific questions to him.

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:12.340
And I learned from him about how the Russian command

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.780
and control goes down.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:18.780
And it's very similar to ours because America and Russia

01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:22.380
have been at sort of nuclear dueling with one another

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.780
for 75 years now.

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:27.540
And so everything we have, they have, right?

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:30.820
With the exception of we have a great satellite system

01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.060
and they have a super flawed one,

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:33.140
theirs is called Tundra.

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:38.140
And even Pavel Podvig admitted that there's serious flaws

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.380
in Tundra.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.980
The Russian satellite system, for example,

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:45.220
can mistake sunlight for flames,

01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:48.460
can mistake clouds for a nuclear launch.

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:50.620
This is a fact, okay?

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.780
And what was interesting in interviewing him

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:59.620
was also this recent, very, very dangerous shift

01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:02.460
in nuclear, Russian nuclear policy, which is this.

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:05.620
Many Russian experts will tell you

01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:07.420
that Russia has always maintained

01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:10.260
that it never had a launch on warning policy.

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.500
Now, I don't know if I believe that's true,

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:14.260
but I'm just telling you what they say.

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:16.340
And this is coming from the generals,

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:18.860
the Cold War generals in Soviet Russia saying,

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.700
oh, no, no, no, we would wait.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.820
They were kind of playing the noble warrior.

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:26.660
We would wait to absorb a nuclear attack

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.540
until we launched, okay?

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:31.020
So many Americans, you know, experts will tell you

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:33.500
that that's just posturing and propaganda,

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.940
but that was their official position.

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:37.820
And that changed just two years ago

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:42.180
when Putin gave a speech and he said

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.900
that their position had changed,

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.260
that they will no longer wait to absorb an attack,

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:50.580
that they, once they learn of, how did he phrase it?

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.140
He called it like the trajectory of the missiles, right?

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.860
Which is a way of talking about parody

01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:00.340
the same way we see the missile coming over in mid course.

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:04.300
Putin made that same statement and said we would launch.

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:06.020
What do you know of the way Putin thinks

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:09.580
about nuclear weapons and nuclear war?

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:13.780
Is it just something to allude to in a speech

01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:15.300
or do you think he contemplates

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:16.980
the possibilities of nuclear war?

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:21.060
I don't know, but if I had to guess, it would go like this.

01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:22.540
I would look at his background

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.180
and he comes from the intelligence world, right?

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:29.340
So my experience in interviewing old timers

01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.820
who have spent decades working for the CIA

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:36.340
or even NRO or NSA, I know the way they think

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.140
from having spent hundreds of hours interviewing them, right?

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:44.140
And then I know the way that military men think

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:46.980
and it's very different, right?

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:50.220
So Putin's not a military person per se,

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.380
he's an intelligence officer.

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:54.780
So what would concern me there

01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.900
if I had to guess about his mindset

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.100
has to do with paranoia, right?

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:03.860
Most intelligence officers must have a degree

01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:08.580
of healthy paranoia or they're gonna wind up dead, right?

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:11.700
And so that's not a great quality to have.

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:14.340
You would be more trigger happy perhaps.

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:19.340
So you would be more prone to respond to erroneous signals.

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:22.380
And you'd be suspicious and you can see that now.

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:27.380
There's such an incredible distrust

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:33.060
and sort of real conflict between Russia,

01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:39.580
between its leader and NATO,

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.500
between its leader and all of the West.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:47.300
And then that is fueled by his closest advisors.

01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:52.660
Kind of, they seem to be,

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:54.420
from the statements they have made

01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.100
that I've read in translation,

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:58.460
they seem to be fostering that same idea

01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:03.300
that NATO really has it in for Russia.

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:05.820
The America really has it in.

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.780
And that is so dangerous and disheartening.

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:11.180
And perhaps makes it less likely

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:14.060
that the president would pick up the phone

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:15.700
and talk to the other president.

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:19.060
And or that the close advisors near the president

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:20.420
would make that happen.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:24.220
You were talking about the procedure with the football.

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:27.500
Is there any concern for cyber attacks?

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.660
For sort of security concerns of,

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:36.300
at every level here, false signals, errors,

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.260
shutting down the channels of communication

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:41.620
through cyber attacks, all that kind of stuff.

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:43.900
So to answer those questions,

01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.460
I interviewed a number of people,

01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:48.780
but most specifically, General Tuhill,

01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:52.180
who was Obama's cyber chief.

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.340
And he was actually America's first cyber chief.

01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:01.340
And the nuclear command and control system,

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:06.460
and really the triad, functions on analog systems.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.780
It functions on old school systems.

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.220
If there's not digital interface,

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:14.220
you can't hack into it, right?

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:17.900
So most of the issues that I raise in the book

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:22.900
have to do with what happens to cyber

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:25.380
after a nuclear attack, right?

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:30.380
What happens to cyber in the minutes after a bomb,

01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:32.940
a nuclear weapon strikes America,

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:37.340
and how that impacts the ability for people

01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:38.940
to communicate with one another.

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:42.740
And that's when chaos takes control.

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:46.100
Well, let's talk about it.

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:51.100
So, God forbid, if a nuclear weapon reaches its target,

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:54.940
what happens?

01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.260
Perhaps you could say what you think

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:01.260
would be the first target hit.

01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.500
Would it be the Pentagon?

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:07.020
I was told by many people I interviewed

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.740
that the biggest fear in Washington, D.C.

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:12.500
is what's called a bolt out of the blue attack.

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:16.380
That's an unwarned nuclear attack against Washington, D.C.

01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:17.940
The target would be the Pentagon,

01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.980
and that's what I begin the scenario with.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:25.980
And I reported in graphic, horrifying detail what happens

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:28.700
because I don't know what's worse,

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:31.180
me writing that all out or the fact

01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:36.180
that it's all documented by the Defense Department.

01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:39.020
I mean, they have been documenting the effect

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:43.060
of nuclear weapons on people and animals and things

01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:47.060
since the earliest days of the Cold War.

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:51.420
And all of the details I pull are from these documents

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:54.060
like the effects of nuclear weapons.

01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:59.180
And again, this document was the original information,

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.580
the original data in this document

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:03.300
come from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, right?

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:04.660
It was all classified.

01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:07.780
And then it was built upon by those 200

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:12.060
some odd atmospheric nuclear weapons tests we did.

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:16.900
And we're talking about like millimeters and inches.

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:18.460
We're talking about the Defense Department

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:22.260
knowing that, oh, seven and a half miles out,

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:25.820
the upholstery on cars will spontaneously combust.

01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:27.860
The pine needles will catch on fire.

01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:30.780
They will start more fires.

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:35.780
You have all kinds of mayhem and chaos happening.

01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:42.780
Based on reported facts from observations.

01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:48.060
And this is really shocking and grotesque at the same time.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:53.860
So one warhead reaches the Pentagon,

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:57.300
everybody in the Pentagon perishes.

01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:00.980
180 million degrees.

01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:05.700
The fireball on a one megaton nuclear weapon

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:09.300
is 19 football fields of fire.

01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:10.500
Think about that.

01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:12.660
Nothing remains.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.900
Nothing remains.

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:18.900
And there's then a radius where people die immediately.

01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:23.760
And then there's people that are dead when found.

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:28.860
And then there's people that will die slowly.

01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.700
Yes.

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.220
They're centric rings.

01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:34.340
And again, rings defined by defense scientists.

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:36.700
But before that, the bomb goes off.

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:39.020
Then there's this blast wave

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:42.340
that's like several hundred miles an hour

01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:46.980
pushing out like a bulldozer, knocking everything down.

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:49.200
Bridges, buildings.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.300
I mean, you can read FEMA manuals

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.260
about what the rubble will be like.

01:32:55.260 --> 01:33:00.020
You're talking about 30 feet deep rubble

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.420
as the buildings go over.

01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.160
Six, seven, eight, 10 miles out.

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:09.460
That speaks nothing of the megafires that will then ensue.

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:11.340
So once all these people die

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.460
and third degree radiation burns,

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:15.140
did you even know there was such a thing

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:17.540
as fourth degree radiation burns?

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.940
We're talking about the wind ripping the skin

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:23.500
off people's faces many miles out.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.900
And then you have a sucking action.

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:31.380
Everyone is, or many people are familiar

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.020
with what the nuclear mushroom cloud looks like.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:37.380
And its stem is actually creates,

01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:39.420
and again, this is from physicists

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:42.260
who advise the Defense Department on this,

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:47.260
the sucking up into the nuclear stem, 300 mile an hour winds.

01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:49.740
You're talking about people miles out

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:51.620
getting sucked up into that stem.

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:53.860
When you see the mushroom cloud, Lex,

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.780
that is in a nuclear war, that would be people.

01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:01.460
Those are like the remnants of people and of things

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:06.460
in the cloud, 30, 40 mile wide mushroom cloud

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.100
blocking out the sun.

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:12.860
And that speaks nothing of the radiation poisoning

01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:14.060
that follows.

01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:16.400
And then the power grid goes out.

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.460
Basically everything we rely on

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:24.560
in terms of systems in our way of life goes out.

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:27.840
You write, quote, those who somehow manage to escape death

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.920
by the initial blast, shockwave, and firestorm

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.280
suddenly realize an insidious truth about nuclear war,

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:38.560
that they're entirely on their own.

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:41.740
Here begins a, quote, fight for food and water.

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:48.640
I mean, that is a wake up call on top of a wake up call

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.640
that we go back to a kind of primitive fight for survival,

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:57.820
each on their own.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.880
And by the way, those details were given to me

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:04.320
by Obama's FEMA director, Craig Fugate,

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:09.320
who was in charge of, so FEMA is the agency in America

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.960
that plans for nuclear war, okay?

01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.560
And what Fugate said to me was, you know, Annie,

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.440
we plan for asteroid strikes.

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.960
These are called low probability,

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:23.800
but high consequence events.

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:27.040
And FEMA is the organization that, you know,

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:29.960
when there's a hurricane or an earthquake or a flood,

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:32.120
FEMA steps in and they do what's called

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:34.400
population protection planning, right?

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:35.680
They take care of people.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.720
And what Fugate told me is after a nuclear strike,

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.960
after a bolt out of the blue attack, he used those terms,

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.600
there is no population protection.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.480
Everyone's dead, right?

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:48.760
And he means that metaphorically,

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.680
but also kind of more literally,

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:53.520
because he just said, at that point,

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.120
you just hope that you stalked Pedialyte.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:01.280
What do you think happens to humans?

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.960
Like, how does human nature manifest itself

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.360
in such conditions?

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.640
Do you think like brutality will come out?

01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:11.160
Like people will, just for survival,

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.880
will steal, will murder, will?

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.400
I can't imagine that not happening.

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.800
I think that's why people love post-apocalyptic

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.160
television shows and films, because they see that.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.520
And then of course, there's always one great

01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:28.000
charismatic person who's trying to restore morality.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.680
And these are great narratives that people like

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:33.520
to tell themselves in the world of science fiction.

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:36.000
But what we're dealing with is science fact

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.640
in this scenario.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.240
And it is meant to terrify people into realizing,

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:44.360
wait a minute, this is a conversation

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.360
that absolutely should be have had,

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.920
while it can still be had.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:54.640
Because the realities, when you have the director of FEMA

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.480
telling you this, it's a real wake-up call.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:02.480
And by the way, Craig Fugate was so transparently human

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.600
with me, and I quote him directly in the book,

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.880
but he spoke about, you asked me earlier about like,

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:10.720
what would be going through the president's mind?

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:12.560
And we don't know, I don't know.

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.400
But Craig Fugate told me what would be going

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:16.520
through his mind.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:19.280
And he said, along the lines I'm paraphrasing,

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.120
it's almost something you couldn't even comprehend.

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.080
It would just ruin you.

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.560
His words are really powerful.

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:32.720
And of course, the FEMA director in the scenario

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.480
is notified in that first window while the launch,

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.400
while the ballistic missile is on its way,

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.080
and no one in America yet knows.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.440
And I have the FEMA director pull over

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.360
to the side of the road and jump in a helicopter

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.720
that's sent for him to take him to the bunker

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.120
that FEMA goes to, which is called Mount Weather.

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:53.160
And so he's aware that, Fugate was aware

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.080
that as FEMA director, you would likely be taken

01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:01.080
to a safe place however many hours you're gonna be safe

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:04.200
or days or maybe weeks or maybe months.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.520
But as I also learned from the cyber people I interviewed

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:11.800
that there's a complete fallacy that these military bases

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.400
can continue functioning.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:15.760
They run on diesel fuel.

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.360
And when the fuel stops pumping, there's no more generators.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:21.920
Electricity's gone.

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.160
Communication lines are all gone.

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:33.160
The food supply, all of it, all the supply chains is gone.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.120
It's terrifying.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:42.000
And that's just in the first few days, first few hours.

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:48.480
In part five, you describe the 24 months and beyond

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:52.600
after this first hour we've been talking about.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:54.960
So what happens to Earth?

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:59.680
What happens to humans if a full on nuclear war happens?

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:05.520
So for that, I was super privileged to talk

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:09.520
to Professor Brian Toon, who is one of the original five

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.960
authors of the nuclear winter theory.

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:16.800
And that theory was developed and was published

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.560
in the early 1980s.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.080
One of Professor Toon's professors was Carl Sagan,

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.400
who was sort of the most famous author

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:27.320
of the nuclear winter theory.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:31.560
And there were all kinds of controversies about it

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.720
when it came out, including the Defense Department saying

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:37.040
it was Soviet propaganda, which it wasn't.

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.040
And what the nuclear winter authors conceded back

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.600
in the 80s was that their modeling was just the best

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.320
it could be based on what they had at the time.

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:54.800
And so now flash forward to where we are in 2024.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.440
And talking to Professor Toon, who's been working

01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.760
on this issue for all these decades since,

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:04.800
he shared with me how the climate models today

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.360
with the systems we have, the computer systems reveal

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:12.280
that actually nuclear winter is worse, right?

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:17.280
So to answer your questions, the bombs stop falling

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:21.080
in my scenario, 72 minutes after they first launch.

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:22.920
The bombs stop falling.

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.360
And then the mega fires begin.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.480
Each nuclear weapon will have,

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.320
according to the Defense Department,

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.640
a mega fire that will burn between 100 and 300 square miles.

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:37.560
So 1,000 weapons, 1,500 weapons.

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:39.480
Think about those mega fires.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.840
Everything is burning, forests, cities.

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.360
Think about the pyrotoxins in all the cities.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.120
High-rise is burning.

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:52.240
And all of this soot gets lofted into the air

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.240
according to Toon, some 300 billion pounds of soot.

01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.600
And what happens?

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.920
It blocks out the sun.

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:05.600
And without sun, we have nuclear winter.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.600
We have a situation whereby ice sheets form.

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.400
You're talking about bodies of water

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:18.280
in places like Iowa being frozen for 10 years.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:19.960
So temperature drops.

01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:22.800
Temperature plummets, right?

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:24.440
And there are all kinds of papers

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.200
that have been written about this.

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.520
Using modern systems.

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.920
And the numbers vary.

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:37.040
But the bottom line is agriculture fails.

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:39.720
Food, obviously, dies.

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.800
So the agriculture system completely shuts down.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.440
So the food sources shut down.

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.720
So there's no food.

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:48.560
There's no sun.

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:49.800
Temperature drops completely.

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:50.800
No electricity.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.040
And we haven't even spoken of radiation poisoning.

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:58.560
Because the radiation poisoning kills many people

01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:02.200
in the aftermath of the nuclear exchange.

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:07.200
But after the nuclear freeze ends, after nuclear winter,

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:08.760
after the sun starts to come back,

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:11.320
let's say eight, nine, 10 years,

01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:13.120
now you have no ozone layer.

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.400
Or you have a severely depleted ozone layer.

01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.680
And so the sun's rays are now poisonous.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.760
So you have people living underground.

01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.480
And you have this great thawing.

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.080
And with that great thawing comes pathogens and plague.

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.840
And you have this system where the small-bodied animals,

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:33.600
the insects and whatnot, begin reproducing really fast.

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.000
And the larger body animals like you and me

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.080
begin to go extinct.

01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:39.920
Professor Toon said it to me this way.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.920
He said, 66 million years ago, an asteroid hit Earth,

01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:46.560
killed all the dinosaurs,

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.440
and wiped out 70% of the species.

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:53.200
And nuclear war would likely do the same.

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.480
And so here we are talking about this

01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:57.720
because there is a difference.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.920
There's nothing you can do about an asteroid.

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.760
But there is something you can do about a nuclear war.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.480
Do you think it's possible

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.680
that some humans will survive all of this?

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:11.880
So if we look, I mean, how long would it be?

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:14.440
Would it be decades?

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:19.200
Would it be centuries before you start to have

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:25.160
the Earth starts to have the capacity to grow food again?

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.520
Carl Sagan talked about that in his,

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:30.280
this amazing book that he wrote with two scientists,

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:32.520
colleagues called The Cold and the Dark.

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:34.640
And they have, there's a bunch of essays

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:36.160
about exactly this, right?

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.840
Like how, what would happen and how long would it take?

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:40.280
It's really interesting.

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.880
It's dated, you know, it's from the 80s,

01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:43.840
but man, is it shocking.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.000
And you think about that where, okay,

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.240
so men return to sort of the worst,

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.960
most base versions of themselves.

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.880
Civilization is gone, right?

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:56.600
Meaning, you know, civil society.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:57.720
There's no rule of law.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:43:58.960
It's just fend for yourself.

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:00.960
There's, you know, people fighting over

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.840
what little resources there are.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:05.360
Man returns to a hunter gatherer state.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.240
And to really think about this idea,

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:11.280
I looked at the oldest known archeological site

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.440
in the world in Turkey, which is called Gobekli Tepe.

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:18.000
And it's really fascinating to me

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.440
because I interviewed one of the two archeologists

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.400
who first found this site in the early 90s.

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:28.400
And the lead archeologist was a guy named Klaus Schmidt

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.760
and Michael Morsch was the young graduate student

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:31.600
who was with him.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:36.600
And Morsch's description of like coming upon this,

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:39.360
like rumored to be site.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:41.720
There was something called a wishing tree on the site,

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:44.200
which I just found so human and perfect

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:47.280
that it was this magical place and it was locatable

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.560
because there was a wishing tree on a hill

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.360
and it's where people went to wish

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.360
and to hope that their wishes came true.

01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:57.280
I mean, how human is that, right?

01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:59.840
And that is where beneath the wishing tree,

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.600
kind of like in the shadow of the wishing tree,

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.600
there was a tepe, which is a hill.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:08.000
And beneath that, there is the oldest known

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.520
civilization in the world.

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:12.600
12,000 years ago, a group of hunter gatherers

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.640
built this site.

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:16.560
Why? We don't know.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.000
But I imagined when through Morsch's descriptions

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.920
of coming upon, like, you know, he tripped on a rock,

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.360
he told me, right?

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.400
He tripped over a stone that turned out to be

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:31.400
the top part of a 12,000 year old sculpted man,

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:35.600
giant pillar, right?

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.600
And he talked about coming upon that.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.560
And then no one knows really what Gobekli Tepe was for.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.080
And that makes my mind try and answer your,

01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.840
the question you asked me internally, right?

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:50.880
Just as like a human who's here on earth

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.840
for the amount of time I'm here, like,

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:56.160
if there were a nuclear war, what would it be like?

01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:59.040
What would it be like when someone in the future,

01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.000
would we become archeologists one day?

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.760
Would civilization rebuild?

01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.920
Would we develop computers? Who knows?

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.960
It's interesting to think about.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.400
I hope we never have to.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.760
What would we remember about this time?

01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:16.160
It is terrifying to think that most of it will be forgotten.

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.760
Everything we kind of assume will not be forgotten.

01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:21.800
We think maybe some of the technological developments

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.040
will be forgotten.

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:26.640
But we assume like some of history won't be forgotten.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:30.960
But realistically, especially the,

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:34.560
us descending into primitive survival,

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:37.280
probably everything since the industrial age

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.120
will be forgotten, like everything.

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:44.440
Maybe some religious ideas will persist.

01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.160
Some stories and myths will persist.

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:50.000
But like all the wisdom we've gathered,

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.600
higher level sort of technological wisdom would be gone.

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:57.680
That's terrifying to think about.

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:01.960
And like maybe even as you touch on

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.560
the very fact of nuclear war might be forgotten.

01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.840
Like the lessons of nuclear war might be forgotten.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.640
That there are these weapons,

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:15.640
sort of the obvious elephant in the room

01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:18.800
would be one of the things that's completely forgotten.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:22.560
Or become so vague in the recollection of humans

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:26.480
that our understanding will change.

01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:28.960
It's almost as if a God descended on earth

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.040
and destroyed everything.

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.920
Maybe that's how it will persist.

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.360
Sort of like mythological interpretation

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.920
of what nuclear weapons are.

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:38.400
That's terrifying.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.320
Because then it could repeat again.

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.760
But I think for me, the idea of the,

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:50.840
what is buried becomes very interesting and very human.

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:54.520
And in a strange way, optimistic and positive.

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:57.240
Because if you can visualize that wishing tree,

01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.320
and I have a picture of it in the book

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.320
from one of the archeologists who work on that, right.

01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:04.880
You think, what were they wishing?

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:07.120
What were they wishing for, right?

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:08.600
And then you think of your own self,

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.440
what do I wish for in this world, right?

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.440
Because I do think all things come from what happens

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.240
metaphorically around the dinner table, right?

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:24.240
Like what people put their eyes on

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:28.120
becomes interesting and expands what people talk about.

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.280
And ultimately, when you think about the long arc of time

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.240
in human civilization, it does kind of make you

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:40.840
wanna communicate more with your enemies,

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:42.880
with your adversaries.

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:45.840
And I think about the quote,

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.720
what Einstein is said to have said,

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.680
which is that he was asked

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:55.360
what weapons World War III would be fought with.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.920
And he said, I don't know,

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.560
but I know that World War IV

01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:03.760
will be fought with sticks and stones.

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:07.760
Let me ask you about the great filter.

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:13.680
When you look up into our galaxy, into our universe,

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:15.960
look up at the sky,

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:20.840
do you think there's other alien civilizations

01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:23.760
that are contending with some similar questions?

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:28.400
And perhaps the reason we have not definitively

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:33.400
seen alien civilizations is because the others have failed

01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:36.240
to find a solution to this great filter,

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.000
something like nuclear weapons.

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:43.480
I'm not sure, I'm gonna have to think about that question.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.360
But what does come to mind is an answer

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.600
that was given to me similarly, right?

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:57.440
By a man, by Ed Mitchell who went to the moon, right?

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:02.280
And he was the sixth man to walk on the moon.

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.160
And so his opinion, I think,

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:07.720
might count a little more than mine on that subject

01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:12.680
because his lens is so much greater, right?

01:50:12.680 --> 01:50:17.680
And Mitchell was vilified when he got back from the moon

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.160
because it became known that he believed

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:24.200
in things like extrasensory perception

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:30.080
and this kind of mystical, metaphysical way

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.080
of looking at the world.

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.760
And he really suffered from that.

01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:37.800
I mean, he was ridiculed and he lost a lot of his career

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:39.120
and his friends.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:42.040
But what he said to me in our interview

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.040
in our interview about his trip home from the moon

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:52.160
answers that great filter question, I think,

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:55.120
in a way I might wanna adopt, right?

01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:00.120
Which is this, that he said that as they were returning

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:06.280
from the moon to earth, he looked down at the earth

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.600
and I'm paraphrasing him, I write all this in Phenomena,

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:13.200
in an earlier book, but the paraphrasing is that

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:17.720
he looked down from the earth and it was 1971

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:22.080
and he thought about all the conflict going on down below,

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.480
particularly the Vietnam War where many of his friends were.

01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:30.480
And then he looked behind him into the great vast galaxy.

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:36.360
And he had a moment, he says, that was like an epiphany,

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.080
like not a near death experience,

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:40.280
but a sort of near life experience, right?

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:45.120
And that's where he believed that the human consciousness,

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.800
which is where so much of this thoughtfulness

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:52.800
about metaphysics and ESP perhaps come from.

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.960
Mitchell's theory was that human consciousness,

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:03.240
the way to understand it had something to do

01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:06.720
with realizing that man's inner life

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.000
and man's outer life are deeply connected.

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:14.760
In the same way that man is connected to the galaxy.

01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:17.200
And he said it much more eloquently,

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:19.600
but you kind of get the idea that,

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.920
and I think it's why humans have always loved to look up,

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:28.160
right, that there's more there.

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.800
And it's a bit like the wish,

01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:32.200
it's like the big version of the wishing tree, you know?

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:35.080
What do I wish for for myself?

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.960
And what is maybe perhaps the realignment

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.840
of thinking for those of us in search of happiness, right?

01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.960
And rather instead of war is,

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:52.720
you know, what does it mean to have a conscience,

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.760
to have consciousness?

01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:56.640
What does it mean to be a thinking person?

01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.840
What does it mean to be on this earth,

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:03.000
to be born, to live, to die?

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.320
And then there is legacy.

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:08.240
And so all of those ideas are,

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:14.080
I think, foster the kind of conversation

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:17.120
that deescalates conflict.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.120
Yeah, so in some deep way.

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.560
So the mysteries of what's out there

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:27.560
when we look out to the stars are the same mysteries

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:32.280
that we find when trying to understand the human mind.

01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:36.160
And they're coupled in some way.

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:40.080
For me, thinking about alien civilizations out there

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.280
is really the same kind of question,

01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:45.160
which is what are we?

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.080
What is this?

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.040
What are we doing here?

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:49.280
How do we come here?

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.560
Why does it seem to be so magical

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:55.040
and beautiful and powerful?

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.560
Now, where's it going?

01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:59.920
Because it feels like we're really,

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:04.720
perhaps for the first time in history,

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:07.440
are in a moment where we can destroy ourselves.

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:12.440
And so naturally you ask, well, where's others like us?

01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:17.880
Is it perhaps, are we inevitably

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.640
going to a place where we'll destroy ourselves?

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:24.440
Is it basically inevitable that we destroy ourselves?

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:29.200
We become too powerful and insufficiently wise

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:30.960
to know what to do with that power.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:38.400
But like you said, probably the answers to that are in here.

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:40.040
We don't need to look out there.

01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:45.640
I'd love to ask you about the extrasensory perception.

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:48.400
You've written, like you said, the book, Phenomena,

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.440
on the secret history of the US government's investigations

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:56.560
into extrasensory perception and psychokinesis.

01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:59.080
What are some of the more interesting

01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:02.320
extrasensory abilities that were explored by the government?

01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:04.680
And maybe just in general, ESP, what is it?

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:07.960
What do you know of it?

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.720
The book was so interesting to report

01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.040
because I spend so much time

01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:16.440
dealing with mechanized systems, machines, war machines.

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:19.640
And yet the military and intelligence were

01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.680
and continue to be incredibly interested

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:25.400
in the human mind, in consciousness.

01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:28.840
And so, if one is called hard science,

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:31.600
what we're talking about now is called squishy science, right?

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:34.520
And it was really interesting to delve into that world.

01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:39.520
It just couldn't be farther from weapons and war

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:40.880
or could it, right?

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.760
And then I really began thinking,

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:46.640
well, before science and technology,

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:51.640
sort of the supernatural ruled the world.

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:57.160
The Oracle of Delphi in Greece exists for the pre,

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.560
before the common error rulers to go

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:05.000
and beg to learn from the powers that be

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.800
what was going to happen, right?

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:11.800
So all ESP programs, I think,

01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.360
pull from that origin story, right?

01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.960
The leader's desire to know.

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.920
And so I really found it amazing

01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:24.400
that many people think these systems,

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.400
rather these programs started in the 70s.

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.320
I learned they actually began right after World War II.

01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:35.360
And that was because, and here, you know,

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:38.680
in my reporting, I find all things sort of always circle back

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:40.560
to the Third Reich, to the Nazis.

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:45.560
The Nazis had a massive occult program, an ESP program.

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:50.160
Psychokinesis program, astrology.

01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:53.800
Both Hitler and Himmler were deeply interested

01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:56.400
in these occult concepts.

01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.160
And after I learned from records at the National Archives

01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:03.280
that after the war, you know,

01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:06.680
half of everything went to the Soviet Union.

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:08.800
And I'm talking about the trove of Nazi documents

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:11.280
from which the superpowers were then going to learn

01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.640
to fight future wars.

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.680
And half of them went to the United States.

01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:19.680
And so we got this trove of documents about all of this.

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:21.760
And the Soviets got the other.

01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:24.560
And so it set off a kind of psychic arms race,

01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:28.480
which in a weird way paralleled the nuclear arms race,

01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:30.160
which we've been talking about,

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:34.720
in as much that it led one side to constantly wonder

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:36.320
what the other side had.

01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:41.440
Have they been able to find anything interesting

01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:46.080
in this squishy science analysis

01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:48.400
of trying to see how the human mind could be used

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:49.240
as a weapon?

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.480
The CIA most definitely believed

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.560
from my reading of the documents

01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:00.120
that there was something very legit, shall we say,

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:01.240
about ESP.

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:04.200
It couldn't, it was uncontrollable, it was unreliable,

01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.760
but nonetheless it existed.

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:08.760
And being the intelligence agency that they are,

01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.560
they cared less about why it worked.

01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:14.160
They just wanted to know how they could use it.

01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:17.160
And then it got into all kinds of elements

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.320
of placebo effect and this, you know.

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:22.760
And when the military stepped in

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:24.880
and got involved in the programs,

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:27.840
that was a complete disaster in my opinion,

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:30.280
because the military needs to control everything

01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:32.680
in a mechanized systematic way.

01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:34.440
And so they started, for example,

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.600
teaching people to be psychic,

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:39.680
which is a really, really, really bad idea.

01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:44.680
I mean, and you know, flash forward to where we are today,

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:46.720
these programs still exist.

01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:50.880
There's a Navy program which is working on,

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:52.560
based on a lot of data that came back

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:57.560
from the war on terror with certain soldiers knowing,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.400
you know, wait, don't walk down that path.

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.320
There is an IED there.

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:04.000
And they call this the Spidey Sense.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.400
And they actually have a program that works from this.

01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:09.160
So these things never go away.

01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:12.040
They kind of circle around in terms of, you know,

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.440
being made fun of and then taken seriously

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:17.000
and a little of this and of that.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.560
My biggest takeaway from writing that book was a quote

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:23.560
that I referenced in the beginning,

01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.600
which is the Thomas theorem.

01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:30.600
And it says, if men define situations as real,

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:33.120
they are real in their consequences.

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:37.720
Yeah, I mean, placebo, as you've mentioned,

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:39.840
is a fascinating concept.

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:42.880
By the way, a short plug, I started listening to it.

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:46.280
Andrew Huberman just released a podcast

01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:49.240
on placebo, the placebo effect.

01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:51.880
Does he know the origin story of placebo?

01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:52.720
We'll have to ask him.

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:53.560
We'll have to ask him.

01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:54.400
Are you ready for this?

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:55.240
Yes.

01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:58.080
CIA, okay?

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:01.080
And not only that, I can tell you that Dr. Henry Beecher,

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:05.000
Harvard, I think he was also at MIT for a bit,

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:08.200
he came up with that term.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.440
And you might even say for the CIA.

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.680
Does that trouble you that so much of this

02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:17.120
is coming from the CIA first?

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:18.840
You mean the placebo concept or the-

02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:21.040
The placebo concept, but a lot of the sort of

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:24.400
scientific investigations?

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:28.720
Listen, I have such mixed feelings about the CIA

02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:29.560
as one should.

02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:32.080
I think you should have mixed feelings about anything

02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.440
that you cover as a reporter or as a human

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.200
because, and maybe change that from mixed

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:39.560
to conflicting, right?

02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:42.800
Because there are really positive elements

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:46.040
of every organization within the federal government.

02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:49.440
I mean, my first learning about the CIA

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.200
came from the work I did on the Area 51 book

02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:55.600
about their aerial reconnaissance programs,

02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:59.200
which were set up, again, to prevent World War III, right?

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.480
Nuclear World War III, it was this idea

02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.640
that information was king.

02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:07.520
The U-2 spy pain was developed out at Area 51,

02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:10.720
and I interviewed Hervey Stockman,

02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:14.600
the first man to fly over the Soviet Union in a U-2,

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:18.520
gathered all this intelligence, prevented wars.

02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:22.960
Later I wrote a book about the CIA's paramilitary

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.360
surprise kill vanish.

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:26.160
So like, just when I was thinking,

02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:28.080
wow, the CIA is doing all this amazing

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:32.040
non-kinetic activity with aerial reconnaissance,

02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:35.200
then you learn about their kill programs,

02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.480
and that's a whole different set of issues.

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:40.120
It turns out, as you write in that book,

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:44.960
that the CIA assassinates people sometimes,

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:46.840
and we'll talk about it.

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:50.360
But anyway, like you said, conflicting feelings.

02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:54.160
I mean, I work with sources to report my books,

02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:58.120
and so put yourself in my shoes, right?

02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:03.120
I interview for dozens or hundreds of hours

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:04.680
my primary sources.

02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:08.520
In the case of the surprise kill vanish book,

02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:10.200
I traveled with Billy Wall,

02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:13.000
the longest-serving CIA operator,

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.240
back to the scene of the crime.

02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:18.080
Back to the battle, we went to Hanoi, we went to Havana.

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.040
And you really get to know someone,

02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:24.920
and that's when I say conflicting, you know?

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:29.080
I work with sources on a real trust basis, right?

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:30.640
And sometimes people will tell me things.

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:32.960
They'll say, Annie, this is off the record.

02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:37.360
This is for you to know about me on deep background,

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:40.600
because I want you to know who I am.

02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:42.320
And that's powerful.

02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.080
A lot of times it's personal, right?

02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:45.000
It's personal.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.600
It's about their personal life.

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:48.800
And they don't want that,

02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:51.840
and it isn't apropos to what I'm writing about.

02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:53.480
But I need to know that.

02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.720
And that's where it gets conflicted,

02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:56.720
because you, in a good way,

02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:00.240
because you realize where we're all such creatures

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:03.440
of our personal lives, right?

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:06.280
So you have a professional life

02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:09.440
where your national security are in your hands.

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:11.560
I don't know what that is like.

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:13.640
I wonder if you could just speak to that.

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:16.240
You've interviewed so many powerful people,

02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:18.360
so many fascinating people.

02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:21.400
And as you've spoken about,

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.160
trust is fundamental to that.

02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:27.880
So they open up and really show you into their world.

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:30.840
What does it take to do that?

02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:36.160
I think willingness.

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.160
We were talking about trust earlier.

02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:41.640
Like, you have to trust that there's,

02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:43.680
I have to trust that there's a reason

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:46.600
I find myself in a certain situation, right?

02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.560
Otherwise, it would just be a constant doubt paradox, right?

02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.380
Why am I here?

02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:53.720
What am I doing?

02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:58.720
And so I trust that I'm going to learn something of value.

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:03.720
And so I'm willing to listen.

02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:05.560
I really am willing to listen, right?

02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:11.600
Because, and so far, it's always proven.

02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:15.840
The expectations I might have going into something

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:18.680
are dwarfed by the outcome

02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:21.240
because people are so interesting.

02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:24.120
And because the people that I interview,

02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:25.920
because I write about war and weapons

02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:28.320
and national security and government secrets,

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:31.640
and the people I interview are at the heart of all of this.

02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:34.680
I mean, they are really capable people,

02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:39.000
intellectually brilliant, physically capable.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.240
They go so far out on the limb to do their jobs.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:44.880
And by the way, the reason they're talking to me

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:47.000
is because they're still alive.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.440
And so many of their colleagues are dead.

02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:54.280
So it gives them also a wisdom about life,

02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:58.360
about sacrifice, not in cliched,

02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:01.720
sort of nationalistic, jingoistic terms whatsoever.

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:06.720
I'm talking like real, real, what is their real truth.

02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:10.460
When I went to Vietnam with Billy Wah,

02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:13.500
I mean, so much of it was,

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:16.420
the details are just, you know, every detail, right?

02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:21.340
I mean, starting with the fact that he showed up at my house

02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:26.340
with a giant suitcase and a bunch of clothes,

02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:31.020
you know, dry cleaning pressed clothes in plastic hangers,

02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:31.860
carrying them.

02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:34.620
I'm like, Billy, we're going to Vietnam

02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:36.700
and we're going back into the jungle

02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:38.660
to find the Oscar eight battle site.

02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:42.660
Like, what are you carrying, right?

02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:43.820
And he got really mad at me.

02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:45.740
He did not like anyone correcting him.

02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:47.140
And I got my husband on the job,

02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:49.020
like, Kevin, you got to sort this out, right?

02:05:49.020 --> 02:05:51.380
And what transpired was that Billy Wah

02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:56.300
had never taken a trip for personal reasons.

02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:59.100
He operated, I think, in 62 countries

02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:01.300
every single time for the CIA.

02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:02.220
And it would go like this,

02:06:02.220 --> 02:06:05.060
Billy, go to there and get to there, right?

02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:07.100
And that's what he would do when he arrived,

02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:10.260
whatever he needed, he would just get, you know?

02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:11.420
It's not a fashion trip, right?

02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:14.820
So he had no idea how to pack for an overseas trip.

02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:16.300
This was like, oh my God,

02:06:16.300 --> 02:06:18.460
how can you not have the hugest smile on your face

02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:19.300
going into this?

02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.020
I'm with a guy who's 89 years old.

02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:23.100
He's got eight bullet, you know,

02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:27.460
he's got, he's had eight purple hearts from Vietnam, right?

02:06:27.460 --> 02:06:30.180
I mean, he operated against Osama Bin Laden

02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:32.100
10 years before 9-11.

02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:35.500
He went after Bin Laden in Afghanistan when he was 72.

02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:38.660
And he went after Gaddafi during the Arab Spring

02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:39.940
when he was 82.

02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:42.540
And now here he is with me going to Hanoi, you know?

02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:46.380
The details, those human details.

02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.540
But my husband repacked his bag

02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:51.940
and, you know, like got him a proper suitcase

02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:54.380
that was carryable and small and didn't have the hangers,

02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:56.940
you know, he wasn't trailing the hangers.

02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:01.940
But it was the trip home in the taxi

02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:03.780
that I got at this really big reveal.

02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:07.980
Billy reached into that small suitcase

02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:09.740
my husband had given him

02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:13.540
and pulled out a rolled up American flag.

02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:17.100
And he had taken this flag

02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:18.380
because I had tried to help him pack

02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:19.220
and he wouldn't let me.

02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:21.020
And I just thought it was like an old guy being stubborn

02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:22.820
but he didn't want me to see

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:24.940
that he was bringing an American flag to Vietnam

02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:26.140
which is not legal.

02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:29.380
And he wanted to bring that flag

02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:31.900
and take it around everywhere with him

02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:33.220
as he explained to me later

02:07:33.220 --> 02:07:37.100
to honor all of his friends who died there 50 years ago.

02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:39.580
And then when the trip was finished,

02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:42.460
he gave me that flag and it's in my office.

02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:45.140
And that's the kind of relationship

02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:47.740
that you can develop with people as a reporter

02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:49.940
if you're willing to go the extra mile with them,

02:07:49.940 --> 02:07:53.100
to trust them, that they'll tell you things of value.

02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:56.660
And to me, something like that is as of value

02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:59.420
as any, you know, secret mission,

02:07:59.420 --> 02:08:01.500
I'm able to get declassified

02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:03.620
because we are a nation of people.

02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:05.940
And probably there's a bunch of human details

02:08:05.940 --> 02:08:08.420
that you can't possibly express in words,

02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:11.660
things left unspoken, but you saw in the silence,

02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:13.860
exchange between the two of you, the sadness,

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:18.220
the maybe you could see on his face

02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:23.100
looking back at memories of the people he's lost,

02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:24.140
all that kind of stuff.

02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:25.340
All that kind of stuff.

02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:29.140
You mentioned you wrote a book on Area 51.

02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:33.260
For people who don't know, you've written a lot

02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:38.260
about security, the military, secrets,

02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:40.780
all this kind of stuff.

02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:45.300
So Area 51 is one of the legendary centers

02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:48.620
of all of these kinds of topics.

02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:53.020
So high level first is what is Area 51?

02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:57.060
As you understand it, as you've written about,

02:08:57.220 --> 02:08:58.700
the lore and the reality.

02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:01.900
I think everybody wants to know about Area 51

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:05.700
because it kind of, it's like this American enigma.

02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:08.540
It's like to some people, it's the Shangri-La

02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:13.060
of test bed aerospace programs, right?

02:09:13.060 --> 02:09:15.980
And to others, it's the place of captured aliens, right?

02:09:15.980 --> 02:09:17.820
And everything in between.

02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:21.860
I had the great fortune of interviewing 75 people

02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:23.500
who lived and worked at that base

02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.460
for extended periods of time.

02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:27.980
Mostly leading up to the 90s

02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:29.980
because everything since then is classified, right?

02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:32.700
So things get declassified after decades,

02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:33.820
not everything, but some.

02:09:33.820 --> 02:09:36.740
And that allows you to piece together stories.

02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:39.060
So you've talked to a lot of people that work there.

02:09:40.420 --> 02:09:42.900
What can you describe as sort of the history

02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:45.300
of technological development that went on there?

02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:47.420
I mean, Area 51 is huge, by the way.

02:09:47.420 --> 02:09:51.340
And it's a secret, it's a top secret military facility

02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:54.020
inside a top secret military facility.

02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:57.100
Inside a top secret military facility,

02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:00.100
inside the Nevada test and training range,

02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:04.020
which is this massive, not secret facility, right?

02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:05.940
So you're just talking about layers.

02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:08.420
Talk about peeling the onion in reverse.

02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:12.220
And it began as a place to test the U-2 spy plane.

02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:17.780
And literally the CIA set up shop there

02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:22.780
to build this plane away from the public eye.

02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:28.700
And then that led to another espionage platform

02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:30.020
called the A-12 Oxcart,

02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:33.380
which is anyone who's seen the X-Men movies

02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:37.580
knows about the SR-71, and that's a two seater, right?

02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:39.940
And before that, there was the A-12 Oxcart.

02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:44.220
And that was the CIA's stealth Mach 3 spy plane.

02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:48.300
Think about that in the early 1960s, it's astonishing.

02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:50.380
And I interviewed the pilots who flew it.

02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:52.580
What did they say about it?

02:10:52.740 --> 02:10:54.020
Oh my God.

02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:58.460
I mean, look, I describe in detail in Area 51,

02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:01.860
but also the amazing thing, Lex, about that was that,

02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:03.820
and I just look back on that with such fondness.

02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:06.820
This is like in 2009 when I was reporting that.

02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:10.220
And many of the guys who were in their 80s and 90s

02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:12.020
were World War II heroes,

02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:14.180
like serious World War II heroes,

02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:17.340
like Colonel Slater, who was the commander of Area 51.

02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:20.420
He flew the U-2 on the missions

02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:25.420
called the Black Cat missions over China in the early 1960s

02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:28.780
to see about their Lop Nor nuclear facility, right?

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:31.340
So all of these things tie in

02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:35.300
when you're reporting on military and intelligence programs.

02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:38.740
But these guys had been World War II heroes,

02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:43.340
and then were given this cushy job out at Area 51, you know?

02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:45.020
And it just came with all these perks.

02:11:45.020 --> 02:11:48.580
Colonel Slater told me this one perk I just love so much.

02:11:48.580 --> 02:11:52.500
They all had a hankering for lobster one day, right?

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.940
And here they are in the middle of the desert, Nevada,

02:11:54.940 --> 02:11:57.940
and they have these really fast planes, you know?

02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:00.500
And they literally called, like they arranged,

02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:02.860
they didn't take the ox guard out for that one,

02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:06.740
but they got some lobsters from Massachusetts,

02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:08.900
like delivered to them in like record time.

02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:11.260
They didn't even need to put them on ice, you know?

02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:13.620
And again, those are these details where you're like,

02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:17.060
thank God, at least for me, thank God I got these details.

02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:19.100
These guys are all passed now.

02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:20.620
Yeah.

02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:22.300
So there's a lot of incredible

02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:24.180
technological work going on there.

02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:27.300
So the legend, the lore, like you said, aliens.

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:32.860
Were there ever aliens in Area 51, as you understand it?

02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:36.980
So I've interviewed hundreds of people.

02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:38.260
That worked there.

02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:39.620
Well, not just at Area 51,

02:12:39.620 --> 02:12:41.500
but in all the different national security

02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:44.620
and military intelligence and intelligence programs.

02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:49.580
I personally have no reason to believe

02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:52.340
that aliens have ever visited Earth.

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:53.460
That's just me personally.

02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:55.180
Visited Earth, period.

02:12:55.180 --> 02:13:00.180
I have no information that causes me to conclude

02:13:00.300 --> 02:13:01.140
that's the case.

02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:05.500
Now, with that said, many of the primary players

02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:08.580
in this present day, you know,

02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:11.420
there are aliens among us narrative,

02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:13.420
are in my phenomena book.

02:13:13.420 --> 02:13:16.180
I continue to communicate with a lot of these people.

02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:18.780
I'm talking about astrophysicists

02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:20.820
who fundamentally believe

02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:23.980
that there are aliens among us, right?

02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:28.140
So we beg to differ on that issue.

02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:32.700
But for you, in terms of doing research

02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:38.820
on government agencies that do top secret military work,

02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:43.380
I mean, they would know, right?

02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.780
So you have interviewed a lot of people that have,

02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:48.660
at every layer of the onion,

02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:56.820
you don't see evidence or a reason to believe

02:13:57.020 --> 02:14:00.580
that there was ever aliens or UFOs captured

02:14:00.580 --> 02:14:02.060
from out of this world.

02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:05.540
That is correct, and even perhaps more important,

02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:07.660
and perhaps this colors my thinking.

02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:12.140
But I am uniquely familiar with disinformation programs

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:15.020
put forth by the CIA or the agency,

02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:17.380
as it's called by insiders, right?

02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:21.140
And I've learned firsthand about these programs

02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:23.620
or rather learned from firsthand participants

02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:26.380
in strategic deception campaigns

02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:30.420
that the CIA has engaged in beginning with Area 51.

02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:33.780
You know, the idea that all these reports

02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:39.660
of this U-2 spy plane, this giant long wind,

02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:43.740
long winged aircraft flying 70,000 feet up,

02:14:43.740 --> 02:14:46.060
people didn't think airplanes could fly that high.

02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:48.620
And it's, you know, the sun shining off of it,

02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:51.380
it looked like a UFO and all the reports coming in.

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:56.380
And the CIA opened up a UFO disinformation campaign office

02:14:58.140 --> 02:15:01.180
headed by a guy named Toto Autorenko,

02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:03.380
you know, specifically for this reason.

02:15:03.380 --> 02:15:07.300
Now, does that mean that every UFO sighting in the world

02:15:07.300 --> 02:15:08.180
has been a U-2?

02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:13.180
No, but I come from it, from that lane of thinking.

02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:17.540
And there are so many strategic deception campaigns.

02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:19.140
And as I look over the decades

02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:21.540
of how these same UFO stories,

02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:24.300
and again, this is just my opinion based on my reporting,

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:27.500
this narrative that keeps reoccurring,

02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:30.900
it seems to me like a very large catch-all

02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:34.340
to keep the public's attention on that, not on that.

02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:40.060
So to you, like sexy stories like UFOs

02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:45.740
are going to be leveraged by the CIA

02:15:45.740 --> 02:15:47.380
for strategic deception?

02:15:47.380 --> 02:15:48.220
100%.

02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:50.140
I mean, Google Paul Benowitz.

02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:52.860
I'm always amazed that Paul Benowitz's story

02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:55.060
is not more widely spoken of.

02:15:56.300 --> 02:15:58.420
And I think that's because people,

02:15:58.420 --> 02:16:00.060
there's like the sort of youthologists

02:16:00.060 --> 02:16:02.420
or the people who are like absolutely convinced

02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:04.780
that aliens are among us.

02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:07.380
And I use that term loosely, but you know what I mean.

02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:09.300
And then there's the quote unquote skeptics.

02:16:09.300 --> 02:16:13.260
And the skeptics tend to be sort of like self-righteous.

02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:15.220
And I would never wanna be self-righteous.

02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:16.980
So I'm not a skeptic.

02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:20.460
I'm just agnostic, I suppose.

02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:22.820
But Google Paul Benowitz,

02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:25.060
and you can learn the story of that man

02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:28.980
who thought he saw a UFO in the 70s, early 80s,

02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:30.180
and the Air Force,

02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:33.260
because the Air Force intelligence community

02:16:33.260 --> 02:16:36.180
works hand in glove with CIA a lot.

02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:37.940
And some of the other intelligence agencies,

02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:40.980
of course they're 17, not just the CIA.

02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:44.180
And they destroyed Paul Benowitz.

02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:46.100
They sent him to a mental institution

02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:50.100
by pulling a massive strategic deception campaign

02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:52.620
against him because they didn't want him to know

02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:54.140
about the technology that he was seeing

02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:56.340
at Kirkland Air Force Base.

02:16:56.340 --> 02:16:57.580
So look that up.

02:16:57.580 --> 02:16:59.180
And then you go, oh my God.

02:16:59.180 --> 02:17:04.180
And to my eye, you can apply any of these other names

02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:06.900
substitute in Paul Benowitz,

02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:09.100
or any of the current individuals

02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:13.340
who really become convinced of X, Y, or Z

02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:14.900
when in fact there's a strategic

02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:16.700
deception campaign going on.

02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:18.700
Yeah, there's a lot of incentive

02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:21.620
for the CIA and other intelligence agencies

02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:23.980
to get you to look the other way

02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:26.260
on whatever is happening.

02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:30.820
Plus from an enemy perspective,

02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:32.820
whenever two nations are at war,

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:35.660
to try to create hysteria in the other.

02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:37.500
But then you have the Thomas theorem

02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:39.340
that becomes applicable there too.

02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:42.020
If men define situations as real,

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:44.980
they are real in their consequences, right?

02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:49.980
So this idea of like UFOs and we're being lied to,

02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:54.660
it becomes real to many people.

02:17:54.660 --> 02:17:58.340
And then that creates a whole subset of problems

02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:02.300
to the point where things are spiraling out of control.

02:18:02.300 --> 02:18:05.140
And there is no center anymore, right?

02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:09.220
So a lot of people that are briefed on programs

02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:13.300
maybe aren't even aware of their position

02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:14.860
within a greater campaign.

02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:19.900
Or I'm wrong and there are aliens in the world

02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:22.660
and there are aliens among us.

02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:27.660
Right, so I appreciate the possibility of acknowledging

02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:29.460
that you might be wrong.

02:18:29.460 --> 02:18:32.460
From everything you know about the US government,

02:18:32.460 --> 02:18:35.100
if there was an alien spacecraft,

02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:36.420
what do you think would happen?

02:18:36.420 --> 02:18:38.820
Would they be able to hold on to those secrets

02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:41.060
for decades?

02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:45.020
Like would they want to hold on to those secrets?

02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:47.860
Like what would they do?

02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:49.700
What's your sense?

02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:54.380
And that kind of exciting situation

02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:57.900
not becoming public information, right?

02:18:57.900 --> 02:19:00.580
And the counter to that is this, right?

02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:02.540
This is a very strong argument

02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:05.740
for why this is a big strategic deception campaign, right?

02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:10.740
Think about the defense department and the air,

02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:16.980
think about how jealously they guard its airspace, right?

02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:20.180
I mean, you had a Chinese balloon flying over

02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:22.780
and the whole world went crazy, right?

02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:24.860
It was front page news.

02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:28.580
So the fact that one element or a couple people

02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:31.060
in the defense department have made this statement,

02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:33.940
we've lost control of our airspace

02:19:33.940 --> 02:19:39.020
over this UFO, alleged UFO craft that they can't explain.

02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:42.980
I don't buy that at all, zero.

02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:48.020
Of course it's possible that it is alien spacecraft

02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:52.740
if it is that and they operate under a very different set

02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:56.540
of technological capabilities in theory.

02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:58.220
In my interviews with Jacques Vallee,

02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:01.820
who is the kind of grandfather of all ufology

02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:03.420
and he's such an interesting person

02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:06.140
and has such a really unique origin story

02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:08.100
about how he came into all of this

02:20:08.100 --> 02:20:09.540
and he's such a scientist, right?

02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:12.540
And he is profoundly dedicated to this issue

02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:15.140
and stands completely on the opposite end

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:17.100
of the spectrum from me and knows a lot more

02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.780
and has studied this for decades more.

02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:21.500
But what he said to me is the most interesting thing,

02:20:21.500 --> 02:20:23.780
which is that it's not a military problem,

02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:25.740
it's an intelligence problem.

02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:26.700
Because Jacques believes

02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:29.740
that this is some kind of intelligence, right?

02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:32.740
Which really, the closest I can do

02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:34.980
to wrapping my head around that

02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:36.940
takes me to consciousness, right?

02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:39.700
The idea of what is consciousness.

02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:41.940
And I think that's where it becomes very interesting.

02:20:41.940 --> 02:20:45.020
I think the government is hiding bodies

02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:47.700
and crafts is very Paul Benowitz,

02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:50.300
read it, Google it and do it, right?

02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:53.980
Yeah, I think this kind of flying saucer thing

02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:58.420
is a trivialization of what kind of,

02:20:58.420 --> 02:21:00.300
if there's alien civilizations out there.

02:21:00.300 --> 02:21:02.940
Trivialization, that's a great word.

02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:05.540
Trivialization, I agree with you.

02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:08.940
I tend to believe that there's like a very large number

02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:11.180
of alien civilizations out there

02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:15.820
and I believe we would have trouble comprehending

02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:18.820
what that even looks like, were they to visit.

02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:21.940
I tend to believe they are already here or have visited

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:25.820
and we're too dumb to understand what that even means.

02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:28.060
And they certainly would not appear as,

02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:33.580
as flying objects that defy gravity

02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:36.740
for brief moments of time on a low resolution video.

02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:40.540
I tend to have humility about all this kind of stuff.

02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:42.540
But I think radical humility is required

02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:43.940
to even like open your eyes

02:21:43.940 --> 02:21:46.900
to what an alien intelligence would actually look like.

02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:51.300
And to me, it's beyond military applications.

02:21:51.300 --> 02:21:54.060
It's like the basic human question of like,

02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:55.340
what is even this thing?

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:57.500
Like you mentioned, consciousness that's going on.

02:21:57.500 --> 02:21:58.860
Like, where does this come from?

02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:00.380
Why is it so powerful?

02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:02.340
Is it unique in the universe?

02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:04.780
I tend to believe not.

02:22:04.780 --> 02:22:08.180
Of course, I hang out a bunch with other folks

02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:11.220
like Elon, who believe we are alone.

02:22:11.220 --> 02:22:15.660
But I think that belief, just like you said,

02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:21.540
has power because it actually manifests itself in reality.

02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:26.580
So if you believe that we're alone in this universe,

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.620
that's a great motivator to build rockets

02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:31.060
and become multi-planetary and save ourselves,

02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:32.940
especially in the case of nuclear war.

02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:36.340
Because otherwise, whatever the special sauce,

02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:40.220
this flame of consciousness will go out

02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:41.820
if we destroy ourselves on this earth.

02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:45.580
And for people like Elon, it's too high of a probability

02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:47.660
that we destroy ourselves on earth,

02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:50.900
not to try to become multi-planetary.

02:22:50.900 --> 02:22:54.740
In your book on Area 51, you propose an explanation

02:22:54.740 --> 02:22:57.780
that I think some people have criticized at the very end,

02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:02.900
that this might've been a disinformation campaign

02:23:02.900 --> 02:23:05.820
from, I guess, Stalin,

02:23:05.980 --> 02:23:10.780
that the Roswell incident was a remotely piloted plane

02:23:10.780 --> 02:23:14.940
with a, quote, grotesque child-sized aviator.

02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:18.380
Just looking back at all that now, years later,

02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:20.180
what's the probability that it's true?

02:23:20.180 --> 02:23:21.860
What's the probability it's not?

02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:27.020
So you know I've never revealed who that source is.

02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:27.860
Yes. Did you know that?

02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:29.100
I know. Want me to tell you?

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.420
Who the source? Yeah.

02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:32.140
Okay, who is the source?

02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:36.420
So before I say anything on that,

02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:40.700
let me speak to the question that you asked, right?

02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:44.340
So you asked me, what's the probability

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:47.180
that that is still standing as an idea

02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:50.460
12, 13, 14 years later, right?

02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:52.740
So I continued to work with that source

02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:54.060
for years afterwards.

02:23:54.060 --> 02:23:55.180
We talked about this.

02:23:55.180 --> 02:24:00.180
Look, I mean, his whole family knew it was him.

02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:01.460
And I knew his family,

02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:03.980
because I was an integral part of, you know,

02:24:03.980 --> 02:24:05.460
I was at his house,

02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:09.100
met all his kids, grandkids, and-

02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:11.380
And we should say the source

02:24:11.380 --> 02:24:14.660
is the main expert advisor behind the story,

02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:16.700
that it was, maybe you can explain what the story is

02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:18.020
that you're reporting in the book,

02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:22.820
that it was disinformation campaign created by Stalin

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:26.180
to cause mass hysteria in the United States.

02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:27.700
The very kind that we've been speaking about

02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:28.940
with the CIA and so on.

02:24:28.940 --> 02:24:31.340
Yes, predicated on the narrative

02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:33.900
of the War of the Worlds, right?

02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:34.860
And the War of the Worlds,

02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:36.780
when it was a radio program in the United States,

02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:37.700
made people go crazy.

02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:39.420
Oh my God, we're being invaded by aliens.

02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:42.020
Well, the government was always interested in this story

02:24:42.020 --> 02:24:43.340
and Joseph Stalin was too.

02:24:43.340 --> 02:24:46.140
We know that from declassified documents, right?

02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:51.060
And so the source told me that the reason for this program

02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:53.060
and that the real Roswell crash remains,

02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:58.060
where in fact, it was a black propaganda hoax

02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:02.300
infiltrated or rather predicated at this idea

02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:04.380
that you were gonna overwhelm America's

02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:06.100
early warning air defense system,

02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:08.860
cause mayhem and maybe be able to attack the United States.

02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:09.780
That was the plan.

02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:12.380
And Stalin was also messing with the United States,

02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:15.860
messing with Truman, who sort of turned his back on him,

02:25:15.860 --> 02:25:17.700
right, at Potsdam.

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:21.660
And so this idea was,

02:25:21.660 --> 02:25:23.460
and the reason that the source is important,

02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:27.340
and unlike a lot of people, I saw this, I saw that,

02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:29.780
I learned that, was according to the source,

02:25:31.740 --> 02:25:36.340
once it was determined that this was a hoax

02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:39.060
and that Stalin was able to get a craft

02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:41.620
over the United States and it crashed,

02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:43.900
and it had people inside of it,

02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:47.580
they were people that were sort of deformed

02:25:47.580 --> 02:25:52.020
and meant surgically altered to look like aliens.

02:25:53.060 --> 02:25:54.660
The United States government decided

02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:58.580
that it needed to know what on earth that was all about

02:25:58.580 --> 02:26:00.860
and if it was possible for us to have the same program,

02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:02.700
this according to the source, right?

02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:06.180
And so it sounds preposterous.

02:26:06.180 --> 02:26:08.140
And if it was just someone saying,

02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:09.740
you might say, well, it's ridiculous,

02:26:09.740 --> 02:26:12.020
tell me and get them onto another subject.

02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:14.700
But the difference was, is this source,

02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:16.340
who is very well-placed and friends

02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:18.740
with all of the other 75 people,

02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:22.580
told me this as a confession, right?

02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:24.620
A real tearful confession,

02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:27.140
because what he said is he was involved

02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:29.900
in the American program to do the same thing

02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:31.700
and people died because there were

02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:33.860
human experiments that went on.

02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:36.700
And I write about this in the last 12 pages of Area 51.

02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:39.620
It was an explosive revelation

02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:42.020
and I felt very confident in writing this

02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:43.740
because the source wanted it written.

02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:44.580
Why?

02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:47.980
Because he said, I'm dedicated to my country.

02:26:47.980 --> 02:26:51.740
I know about being committed to national security

02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:53.660
and this kind of thing must never happen.

02:26:53.660 --> 02:26:55.260
And if you give people too much power,

02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:57.180
they will take advantage of it.

02:26:57.180 --> 02:26:59.540
And he wanted it on the record.

02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:02.300
And his wife of 60 years did not know

02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:04.180
until after the book published,

02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:05.700
nor did his children, okay?

02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:09.340
So after the book published, I was called to his house

02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:11.700
and sat there with his family.

02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:13.940
And they said, tell us this isn't true.

02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:15.500
And he said, it is true, right?

02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:20.540
Now that source is Al O'Donnell,

02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:23.100
who is the nuclear weapons engineer

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:28.100
who armed, wired, and fired 186 nuclear weapons, okay?

02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:33.500
So if you want to talk about something,

02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:35.540
you're the first person I've told that on the record,

02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:36.900
but it's kind of about time.

02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:39.660
Wow.

02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:45.500
Well, you received a lot of criticism over this story

02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:48.860
and it confused me why because it's

02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:52.420
given the context of everything you've described

02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:54.980
with the CIA and other intelligence agencies,

02:27:55.940 --> 02:27:58.660
it is reasonable that such an action would be taken.

02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:05.060
And the source is extraordinarily credible, right?

02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:07.420
If you wanted to take the position,

02:28:07.420 --> 02:28:09.420
well, that person isn't very reliable,

02:28:09.420 --> 02:28:11.140
then you have to ask yourself,

02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:14.860
why did they have top secret clearances

02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:18.700
that are higher than any in the United States whatsoever?

02:28:19.540 --> 02:28:22.180
Because he was responsible for arming nuclear bombs.

02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:24.100
He was called the trigger man.

02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:25.460
And by the way, he told me

02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:28.500
that I could tell the world who he was.

02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:32.740
There's a lot of details that are really dark

02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:34.860
involving that program.

02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:37.620
And when is it appropriate, right?

02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:39.460
Well, it feels appropriate now, first of all,

02:28:39.460 --> 02:28:41.220
because you and I have been talking for several hours.

02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:44.900
So this is what is truly a long form conversation.

02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:49.900
And it's the outcome of a very long time of my reporting

02:28:50.140 --> 02:28:52.820
and also being judicious about

02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:56.140
closing the loop on that, right?

02:28:56.140 --> 02:28:59.260
Because I do think it's important for people to know

02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:03.260
that sources have revelations.

02:29:06.220 --> 02:29:11.140
And like you said, the programs both on the Soviet side

02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:16.140
and the American side, conflicting, I think is the term

02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:21.580
we used previously, ethically, morally, on all fronts,

02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:27.380
people have done some horrible things

02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:28.700
in the name of security.

02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:35.100
In your book, Surprise, Kill, Vanish,

02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:37.220
you write about the CIA

02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:40.580
and the so-called president's third option.

02:29:41.620 --> 02:29:43.140
It turns out, so first of all,

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:45.500
first option being diplomacy

02:29:45.500 --> 02:29:48.500
and second option being war.

02:29:48.500 --> 02:29:51.420
So when diplomacy is inadequate and war is a terrible idea,

02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:52.860
we'll go to the third option.

02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:57.860
And this third option is about covert action

02:29:57.860 --> 02:30:01.060
and it's about assassination.

02:30:01.060 --> 02:30:03.300
So how much of that does the CIA do?

02:30:04.940 --> 02:30:06.260
That is open to debate.

02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:09.180
We know from the historical record

02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:12.020
that the CIA was heavily involved in assassination

02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:13.060
during the Cold War.

02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:15.500
That's non-negotiable, you know?

02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:20.500
Even the names of the programs that were assigned

02:30:20.580 --> 02:30:22.940
to perform assassinations are fascinating

02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:26.780
and now declassified, like Eisenhower's, for example,

02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:29.700
was the Health Alteration Committee, right?

02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:31.340
Well, at least they have a sense of humor

02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:32.860
into this dark topic.

02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:36.220
You know, then the more modern names are targeted killing,

02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:37.180
right?

02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:40.540
Executive action, targeted killing, right?

02:30:40.540 --> 02:30:44.060
I mean, drone striking is essentially assassination.

02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:47.380
And, you know, people jump up and down

02:30:47.380 --> 02:30:48.620
and say, that's not true.

02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:51.660
Well, I spent quite a long time

02:30:51.660 --> 02:30:55.340
interviewing the CIA's lead counsel, John Rizzo.

02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:57.300
He died recently.

02:30:57.300 --> 02:31:00.700
But Rizzo was very forthcoming with me,

02:31:00.700 --> 02:31:02.820
of course, never sharing classified information,

02:31:02.820 --> 02:31:06.140
but going up to the edge of what can legally be known.

02:31:06.140 --> 02:31:08.340
Rizzo was thrown under the bus

02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:12.260
by sort of the general public for,

02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:15.740
he was the fall guy for the torture campaign.

02:31:15.740 --> 02:31:19.020
The CIA calls it enhanced interrogation.

02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:23.420
And so Rizzo had this long career, you know,

02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:27.100
he began working under the Carter administration, right?

02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:29.260
And was responsible for the torture memos,

02:31:29.260 --> 02:31:31.820
was responsible for legally making sure

02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:33.660
the president's ass was covered,

02:31:34.620 --> 02:31:36.380
and then got thrown under the bus.

02:31:36.380 --> 02:31:38.820
And so he was very forthcoming, not in a bitter way,

02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:42.460
but in a very earnest way about a lot of how these programs

02:31:42.460 --> 02:31:44.220
are made to be legal.

02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:45.900
Because if the president of the United States

02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:47.900
says they're legal, they're legal.

02:31:47.900 --> 02:31:52.060
Executive order one, two, three, three, three, you know?

02:31:52.060 --> 02:31:53.500
It says we don't assassinate,

02:31:53.500 --> 02:31:55.780
but it can be overwritten by another order

02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:57.940
that's straight out of Rizzo's mouth, right?

02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:01.540
Also really important to keep in mind

02:32:01.540 --> 02:32:03.820
is that the military operates under

02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:05.340
what's called Title 50.

02:32:05.340 --> 02:32:07.300
It's part of the national security code

02:32:07.300 --> 02:32:10.980
that gives like sort of, you know, rules and et cetera,

02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:13.380
how you must behave in a war theater.

02:32:13.380 --> 02:32:15.900
Well, the CIA is under no such rules.

02:32:15.900 --> 02:32:18.580
It operates under what's called Title 50.

02:32:18.580 --> 02:32:20.660
And you know, it's interesting to me as a reporter,

02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:21.900
because before I wrote the book

02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:24.260
and reported openly about Title 50,

02:32:24.260 --> 02:32:25.700
it was not really discussed.

02:32:25.700 --> 02:32:28.460
And now you even see operators themselves on podcasts

02:32:28.460 --> 02:32:30.940
talking about Title 50, which is kind of great

02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:33.260
because it's like the cat's out of the bag, guys.

02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:35.620
That's what it's called and that's how it works.

02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:38.580
It means what we say goes.

02:32:38.580 --> 02:32:40.580
Can you elaborate on what Title 50 says

02:32:40.580 --> 02:32:43.300
basically says assassination is allowed?

02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:47.340
It says what the president wants, the president gets, right?

02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:50.620
And so, I mean, the best example

02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:53.060
is the killing of Bin Laden, right?

02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:55.220
We were not at war with Pakistan.

02:32:55.220 --> 02:32:57.100
So Title 50 doesn't apply.

02:32:57.100 --> 02:33:00.980
You can't have a military operation in a country

02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:01.860
you're not at war with.

02:33:01.860 --> 02:33:04.060
I mean, the lines, my God, now they've really blurred.

02:33:04.060 --> 02:33:06.900
But even then, they were a little more honored, right?

02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:08.260
And so what do you do?

02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:10.900
Well, Leon Panetta was the CIA director

02:33:12.100 --> 02:33:17.100
and you work out a scenario whereby the SEALs,

02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:19.540
and by the way, it wasn't the SEAL,

02:33:19.540 --> 02:33:23.100
there was a rotational on that killer capture mission,

02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:24.700
which was really just a kill mission.

02:33:24.700 --> 02:33:26.900
SEALs were practicing, Delta was practicing,

02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:29.100
and Special Activities Division was practicing.

02:33:29.100 --> 02:33:31.020
They were all practicing at a secret facility

02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:33.060
in North Carolina, right?

02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:35.140
And it was just like, they're ready

02:33:35.140 --> 02:33:36.260
till they get the go order

02:33:36.260 --> 02:33:38.700
and it just happened to be the SEALs, okay?

02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:41.660
So the SEALs operate under Title 10.

02:33:41.660 --> 02:33:44.140
So they had to get what I call sheep to dip

02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:45.980
because that's what the insiders call it, right?

02:33:45.980 --> 02:33:47.700
And that is the term that comes from,

02:33:47.700 --> 02:33:49.780
interestingly, Area 51.

02:33:49.780 --> 02:33:52.060
The U-2 pilots were Air Force pilots.

02:33:52.060 --> 02:33:55.220
They needed to be sheep dipped over to the CIA

02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:59.660
so they could do things that defied the law, okay?

02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:01.700
So you can see how these all entwine

02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:03.220
and you become more and more informed

02:34:03.220 --> 02:34:05.060
and you go, aha, right?

02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:06.900
So that's how Title 50 worked.

02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:10.780
So the night of that mission, it was a CIA mission

02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:13.700
because the CIA is allowed to go into Pakistan

02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:16.300
and kill someone and the military can't.

02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:17.140
That's fascinating.

02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:18.900
So people talk about the Navy SEALs doing it,

02:34:18.900 --> 02:34:21.580
but it's really, legally speaking,

02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:22.900
to get the permission to do it

02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:25.740
within the whole legal framework of the United States

02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:27.020
of the CIA.

02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:30.060
And if you look at their uniforms that they were wearing,

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:32.860
and now that you know this, you'll see

02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:35.420
there's no nomenclature on them, right?

02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:39.460
So they're just meant to be completely untraceable.

02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:42.100
Were they to be shot down and captured?

02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:43.500
It's like, wait, who are these guys?

02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:45.860
Oh, a bunch of rogue guys, okay?

02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:48.380
And this goes back, the origin story of all that

02:34:48.380 --> 02:34:50.820
is in Vietnam with MACV SOG

02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:52.940
and these cross-border operations

02:34:52.940 --> 02:34:55.620
that I chronicle in Surprise Kill Vanish,

02:34:55.620 --> 02:34:59.260
which still amaze me to this day, right?

02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:03.140
I mean, SOG missions, they called it suicide on the ground

02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:04.380
because that's what it was.

02:35:04.380 --> 02:35:08.540
And these guys had no identifiable, nothing.

02:35:08.540 --> 02:35:11.220
I mean, they were essentially in pajamas, right?

02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:15.340
Even their weapons were specially designed by the CIA

02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:18.940
to have no serial numbers, no nothing.

02:35:18.940 --> 02:35:22.260
So if they were captured and they became POWs,

02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:23.820
I don't know who these guys are.

02:35:24.660 --> 02:35:27.740
What do you think, and how much do they think

02:35:28.700 --> 02:35:30.100
at the highest levels of power

02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:32.060
about the ethics of assassination

02:35:33.300 --> 02:35:37.860
and about the role of that in geopolitics

02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:40.060
and military operations?

02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:45.060
Like, to you maybe also, does assassination make sense

02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:48.420
as a good methodology of war?

02:35:48.980 --> 02:35:52.660
Again, I try to remain agnostic on the policy part of it

02:35:52.660 --> 02:35:55.300
and just report the operator's perspective, right?

02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:57.020
Because this is what people do

02:35:57.020 --> 02:35:59.700
and this is what people are asked to do.

02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:02.500
And it depends on the individual.

02:36:02.500 --> 02:36:05.940
I mean, Billy Wah went on a lot of those missions.

02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:07.340
I mean, the saying is like,

02:36:07.340 --> 02:36:11.140
oh, Billy Wah, he killed more people than cancer, right?

02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:14.660
Did Billy Wah ever tell me about direct assassinations?

02:36:14.660 --> 02:36:17.700
No, because they're all classified, right?

02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:19.500
Did he tell me about some failed ones?

02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:22.340
Yes, I'll give you an example, it's really interesting.

02:36:23.740 --> 02:36:25.300
He would show me these PowerPoints

02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:26.860
that were just fantastic.

02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:30.220
Late in his life, he was constantly being asked

02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:33.020
to go up to Fort Bragg and lecture to the young soldiers.

02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:35.260
Everybody loved him, you know?

02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:38.780
And he would drive all night to get there

02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:40.180
and he would create these PowerPoints

02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:41.420
and then he would show me the PowerPoints

02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:44.060
and he would, all unclassified.

02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:47.460
But at one point when Hugo Chavez was in power,

02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:50.820
Billy Wah was kind of asked, that's how it works,

02:36:50.820 --> 02:36:53.060
of like, if you had to think about doing something,

02:36:53.060 --> 02:36:55.460
what would it look like, let's just say hypothetically.

02:36:55.460 --> 02:36:57.700
So he took me through this PowerPoint that never happened

02:36:57.700 --> 02:37:00.740
whereby he and a group of operators,

02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:04.300
agency operators, were gonna halo jump in to the palace

02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:06.860
and grab Chavez and probably kill him

02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:09.100
because he wouldn't allow himself to be captured.

02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:12.660
And, you know, what Billy, and by the way, halo jumping,

02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:14.260
for those of listeners who don't know,

02:37:14.300 --> 02:37:17.740
high altitude, low opening, right?

02:37:17.740 --> 02:37:21.140
So you jump out of an aircraft and you go down

02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:24.540
like a pencil until you're really low to the deck,

02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:26.940
like a thousand feet, you pull your parachute cord

02:37:26.940 --> 02:37:29.700
and that way you're not picked up on radar

02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:31.940
and you're also not traceable when you get to the ground

02:37:31.940 --> 02:37:33.340
because it's so fast.

02:37:33.340 --> 02:37:37.300
Billy Wah took the second halo jump in history

02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:40.940
into a war theater in Laos during the Vietnam War, right?

02:37:40.940 --> 02:37:42.940
So he's like this famous halo jumper, right?

02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:46.180
So he and the team were gonna go in, grab Chavez,

02:37:46.180 --> 02:37:50.820
and he said to me a very interesting thing

02:37:50.820 --> 02:37:52.380
that was kind of a one-moment time

02:37:52.380 --> 02:37:54.100
where I saw a different side of Billy Wah,

02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:57.820
where he said, I'm so glad we didn't do that

02:37:57.820 --> 02:38:00.820
even though I really wanted to at the time.

02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:05.060
Because can you imagine that country's problems

02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:06.420
where it is now?

02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:09.500
Can you imagine how we would have been blamed?

02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:13.940
And it was an interesting, rare moment for Billy Wah

02:38:13.940 --> 02:38:16.500
to comment on the bigger picture

02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:18.700
that you're asking me about, right?

02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:21.580
I think pretty much the operators I know,

02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:23.580
they just stick to the mission.

02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:26.020
So on the technical difficulty of those missions,

02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:29.220
just your big sense, how hard is it to do, to assassinate?

02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:35.100
To assassinate a target on the soil of that nation?

02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:38.540
I suppose that just depends, right?

02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:41.340
Here's another insightful thing Billy Wah said to me,

02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:42.700
and I'm answering the question around

02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:43.620
because I don't know.

02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:48.100
Because again, I never had anyone say to me,

02:38:48.100 --> 02:38:50.140
here's how it went down, right?

02:38:50.140 --> 02:38:51.940
Because you can't, that would be,

02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:53.660
first of all, those are classified.

02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:56.620
So I'm never gonna receive classified information.

02:38:56.620 --> 02:38:59.260
I did hear a lot about reconnaissance missions

02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:00.980
when people would be in charge of,

02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:02.260
you have to be able to,

02:39:02.260 --> 02:39:05.260
what's called make book on the target before, right?

02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:10.300
And making book on the target means photographing them

02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:13.700
to really, then that gets run up the chain of command

02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:15.340
to make sure this is really

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:17.700
Emad Mugniya we're about to kill, right?

02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:22.340
But I once asked Billy when I was trying to get the question,

02:39:22.340 --> 02:39:23.180
and he wouldn't answer it.

02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:25.300
And I said, so there's another person in my book

02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:29.020
named Rick Prado, who's also like a legendary agency guy.

02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:33.700
And he's like 20 years younger than Billy.

02:39:33.700 --> 02:39:38.700
And I said, Billy, if you and Rick had to kill each other,

02:39:39.980 --> 02:39:41.340
like who would win, right?

02:39:41.340 --> 02:39:43.300
I was trying to imagine this like hypothetical,

02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:44.860
like how would that work, who would win, right?

02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:47.620
And I posed the question to each of them, right?

02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:52.620
And of course, each of them said me, right?

02:39:53.260 --> 02:39:55.980
But Billy, then I went back to them and Billy said,

02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:59.380
let me tell you how I would win, okay, right?

02:39:59.380 --> 02:40:01.100
And he said, I'd cheat.

02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:05.100
I'd show up before the duel and I'd kill him.

02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:08.900
Yeah, that's such a, like, you know,

02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:10.820
I have a lot of friends who are Navy SEALs,

02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:12.900
it's such a guy conversation.

02:40:12.900 --> 02:40:15.140
Well, you would be amazed at what the women do.

02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:16.700
Let me just tell you that.

02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:19.580
Women are part of the Special Activities Division,

02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:22.540
a big part of it.

02:40:22.540 --> 02:40:23.900
Can you comment on that?

02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:25.220
I can.

02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:28.300
Women can get a hell of a lot closer to a target.

02:40:29.140 --> 02:40:31.380
And I mean that literally.

02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:32.780
The Special Operations, do you mean,

02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:34.540
is this part of the CIA?

02:40:34.540 --> 02:40:36.100
The Special Activities Division,

02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:38.980
now it's called the Special Activities Center.

02:40:38.980 --> 02:40:42.500
But originally, that's the umbrella agency

02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:45.420
that has the different paramilitary organizations

02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:46.260
under it, right?

02:40:46.260 --> 02:40:48.940
So the most lethal one is Ground Branch.

02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:52.820
And that's what I reported on in Surprise Kill Vanish.

02:40:52.820 --> 02:40:56.420
And its origins go way back to the guerrilla warfare corps

02:40:56.420 --> 02:41:01.420
that was started in 1947 for the president.

02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:07.180
So women are also a part of the alleged assassination?

02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:10.100
Absolutely.

02:41:11.380 --> 02:41:14.700
And you're saying they can, at times, be more effective?

02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:20.900
I'm just gonna leave that pause there.

02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:24.860
The reason I ask of how difficult the assassinations are,

02:41:25.100 --> 02:41:27.220
with Bin Laden, it took a long time.

02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:31.620
So I guess the reconnaissance, the intelligence,

02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:33.020
for finding the target.

02:41:33.980 --> 02:41:37.660
I imagine with Mossad, maybe the CIA now,

02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:41.180
the leadership of Hamas or the military branch of Hamas

02:41:42.100 --> 02:41:46.940
is much wanted from an assassination perspective.

02:41:46.940 --> 02:41:49.220
So to me, as an outside observer,

02:41:49.220 --> 02:41:52.460
it seems like it's more difficult than you would imagine.

02:41:53.180 --> 02:41:54.420
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:56.380
But perhaps that's the intelligence aspect of it,

02:41:56.380 --> 02:42:00.220
not the actual assassination, of locating the person.

02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:02.980
Well, I think most, it's because mostly,

02:42:02.980 --> 02:42:06.020
from what I understand, it's a really dirty game.

02:42:06.020 --> 02:42:08.220
And people are covering for people, right?

02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:10.060
And I'll give you the example of Billy Wah

02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:12.820
and Imad Mughniya, if I may, right?

02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:15.740
So Imad Mughniya was the most wanted terrorist

02:42:15.740 --> 02:42:17.540
in the world before Bin Laden.

02:42:17.540 --> 02:42:21.220
You know, Hezbollah's chief of operations.

02:42:21.220 --> 02:42:25.140
And he was wanted by every, you know, Mossad, John Down.

02:42:25.140 --> 02:42:26.460
But no one could find him.

02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:27.740
He was missing for 20 years.

02:42:27.740 --> 02:42:29.940
There wasn't even a photograph of him.

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:31.740
And then he resurfaced.

02:42:31.740 --> 02:42:36.740
And of all places, he resurfaced in Saudi Arabia, okay?

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:40.940
So what, that's when I say it's a dirty game, right?

02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:44.620
Hezbollah, Iran, Hezbollah, Iran,

02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:47.740
enemies with Saudi Arabia.

02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:51.500
Why on earth was Imad Mughniya in Saudi Arabia?

02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:53.100
Well, that's where he was.

02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:55.900
There was a Navy SEAL who was doing reconnaissance on him.

02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:57.820
This is according to Billy Wah.

02:42:57.820 --> 02:42:59.540
And this is around 2005.

02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:02.500
So Billy is in his 80s at this point, right?

02:43:02.500 --> 02:43:04.620
Late 70s, 80s.

02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:08.940
And he gets word that the SEAL,

02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:11.620
who has been tracking Mughniya to get photographs of him,

02:43:11.620 --> 02:43:13.980
to give the photographs to Mossad and CIA

02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:15.940
so they can do a joint operation to kill him,

02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:18.860
which they did with a car bomb in Damascus.

02:43:18.860 --> 02:43:20.300
That's the end of the story, right?

02:43:20.300 --> 02:43:23.460
But how we got there was we needed,

02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:24.860
the CIA needed confirmation.

02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:27.100
You can't kill the wrong person.

02:43:27.100 --> 02:43:29.660
So the SEAL panicked according to Billy Wah

02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:30.700
and was just like, I'm out of here.

02:43:30.700 --> 02:43:31.740
This is too dangerous.

02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:34.460
And I do not wanna wind up in a Saudi prison.

02:43:34.460 --> 02:43:35.740
So who do you send in?

02:43:35.740 --> 02:43:37.580
Billy Wah, right?

02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:38.740
He shows up.

02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:40.900
He's there for 24 hours.

02:43:40.900 --> 02:43:43.940
He finds, he knows where Mughniya lives from the SEAL.

02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:48.260
He positions himself in a cafe across the street,

02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:50.220
which is run by Sudanese men.

02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:52.340
And of course, Wah speaks some Sudanese

02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:54.660
because he operated in Sudan, right?

02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:57.300
And he's shooting the shit with him by his own words.

02:43:57.300 --> 02:43:58.860
He had the most foul mouth.

02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:01.340
It was just absolutely delightful to listen to.

02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:06.020
And then in between him and Mughniya's house is a dumpster.

02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:07.740
And Billy Wah being Billy Wah,

02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:10.500
who will go to any lengths to do the job,

02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:15.540
decides to conduct reconnaissance from inside the dumpster.

02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:19.620
And that is where he is when he takes the picture

02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:24.620
of Imad Mughniya living so comfortably in Saudi

02:44:24.620 --> 02:44:26.660
that Mughniya, according to Billy,

02:44:26.660 --> 02:44:31.020
came out of his apartment building with dry cleaner,

02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:33.300
plastic bag hangers over his shoulder.

02:44:34.140 --> 02:44:36.620
That's how comfortable he lived there.

02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:38.020
It was his neighborhood.

02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:40.260
Click, click, click.

02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:42.500
Billy Wah takes the photographs,

02:44:42.500 --> 02:44:47.220
runs them to the CIA headquarters in Saudi at the embassy.

02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:48.900
Oh my God, it's Mughniya.

02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:49.900
Get the hell out of here.

02:44:49.900 --> 02:44:50.820
He gets to the airport.

02:44:50.820 --> 02:44:51.660
He leaves.

02:44:51.660 --> 02:44:54.420
Those photographs get sent to the agency.

02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:56.820
And then they do the operation with Massad

02:44:56.820 --> 02:44:58.460
and Mughniya is dead.

02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:02.860
Now the truth about that being a co-CIA mission

02:45:02.860 --> 02:45:06.380
was not reported for many years after the fact.

02:45:06.380 --> 02:45:08.260
It was originally, Massad took credit

02:45:08.260 --> 02:45:11.540
as the CIA often likes to just give other people credit.

02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:12.860
They just want the job done.

02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:15.820
Well, speaking of Massad,

02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:19.380
what in your understanding of all the intelligence agencies,

02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:21.180
what are the strengths and weaknesses

02:45:21.180 --> 02:45:25.140
of the different intelligence agencies out there?

02:45:25.140 --> 02:45:28.500
CIA, Massad, MI6,

02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:34.300
SVR and FSB and Chinese intelligence,

02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:35.460
all this kind of stuff.

02:45:35.460 --> 02:45:37.580
Is there some interesting differences,

02:45:37.580 --> 02:45:41.420
insights that you have from all of your studying of CIA?

02:45:41.420 --> 02:45:43.180
That's a really interesting question.

02:45:44.700 --> 02:45:45.820
I don't know.

02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:46.700
And here's why.

02:45:46.700 --> 02:45:49.340
It's because I've never interviewed any intelligence officer

02:45:49.340 --> 02:45:52.140
with those other agencies, right?

02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:57.740
I've interviewed a couple people with Shin Bet in Israel.

02:45:57.740 --> 02:46:02.740
But until I speak to an actual source whose job it was,

02:46:05.900 --> 02:46:06.900
I don't know.

02:46:06.940 --> 02:46:08.620
And so the information that I'm getting

02:46:08.620 --> 02:46:12.540
is based on perception of others,

02:46:12.540 --> 02:46:15.460
which one would think would be deeply clouded

02:46:15.460 --> 02:46:17.740
by the idea that America is the greatest.

02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:21.580
Right. Right, right.

02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:23.260
We're better than them, you know?

02:46:23.260 --> 02:46:24.100
Yes.

02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:25.780
Well, actually the fascinating thing is,

02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:27.780
cause you've spoken to a lot of people about,

02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:30.940
they say, hey, how do you know they're telling the truth?

02:46:30.940 --> 02:46:32.100
Like, how do you,

02:46:32.100 --> 02:46:34.300
and this actually probably applies generally

02:46:34.300 --> 02:46:39.300
to your interviews with very secretive people.

02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:41.380
How do you get past the bullshit?

02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:45.500
Well, that's just like multiple sourcing, right?

02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:49.380
So you find the story out and then you have to,

02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:51.980
you go to the national archives and you find the operation

02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:53.300
and then you learn all about this

02:46:53.300 --> 02:46:55.940
and then you interview other people who were there

02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:58.940
and you put the story together to the best of your ability

02:46:58.940 --> 02:47:01.860
and you make very specific choices with, you know,

02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:06.020
quote, so-and-so said, end quote, said so-and-so, right?

02:47:06.020 --> 02:47:11.020
And very rarely do I report on a single source

02:47:11.220 --> 02:47:13.260
as I did in the end of area 51.

02:47:13.260 --> 02:47:18.260
And then it says, essentially, look, dear reader,

02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:21.380
this is what the source told me.

02:47:21.380 --> 02:47:23.620
I have no way of corroborating it.

02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:25.460
This is legit and here it is.

02:47:25.460 --> 02:47:30.460
So that's an area to make your reader comfortable

02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:32.820
with the information that they're being given.

02:47:32.820 --> 02:47:35.300
And then in all of my books,

02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:37.380
whether they're three or 400 pages,

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:39.860
there's always a hundred pages of notes at the end.

02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:42.340
So you can see all the sourcing

02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:45.420
and you can begin to get an understanding

02:47:45.420 --> 02:47:49.420
of how journalism in the national security world works.

02:47:49.420 --> 02:47:51.860
And also great opportunity for me to say,

02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:54.900
I'm often standing on the shoulders of journalists

02:47:54.900 --> 02:47:59.040
before me who did an incredible job digging into something

02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:01.560
and being able to report what they knew.

02:48:01.560 --> 02:48:04.600
Often the books are 10, 20, 30 years old

02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:07.320
and so much more has come to light since.

02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:10.760
And I also would just like to say that I appreciate

02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:13.880
that you said, great question, I don't know.

02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:17.600
Not enough people say I don't know

02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:20.360
and that's a sign of a great journalist.

02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:22.760
But speaking about things you might not know about,

02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.600
let me ask you about something going on currently

02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:34.680
so recently Alexei Navalny died in prison,

02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:38.160
perhaps was killed in prison.

02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:41.800
What's your sense from looking at it?

02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:44.880
Do you think he died of natural causes in prison?

02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:47.200
Do you think it's possible he was assassinated?

02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:52.660
Russia, Ukraine, Assad, CIA,

02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:57.000
whoever has interest in this particular war.

02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:01.880
For that I look directly to the historical record, right?

02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:05.280
Having written about Russian assassination campaigns

02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:10.000
and programs since the earliest days of the Cold War, right?

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:14.120
And Russia has a long history of assassinating,

02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:16.560
murdering, dissidents.

02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:21.240
And in Surprise Kill Vanished I tell the story

02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:26.240
of an actual KGB assassin named Kolkhoff

02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:32.120
who knocked on the door of the man he was assigned to kill.

02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:37.120
And by the way, this all comes from a book

02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:38.320
that Kolkhoff wrote later, right?

02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:39.760
Because he defected to the United States.

02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:43.080
He knocks on the door and the guy answers the door

02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:45.760
and instead of killing him, he has like this moment

02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:49.640
of conscious of crisis or crisis of conscience

02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:51.520
and says like, I can't kill you

02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:53.560
even though that's what I'm supposed to do.

02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:55.240
And then sits down with the guy

02:49:55.240 --> 02:49:59.080
and together decides, okay, we're gonna defect.

02:49:59.080 --> 02:50:03.540
You know, we're gonna let the Western intelligence agencies

02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:05.040
know what we're doing here.

02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:06.960
And the CIA got involved.

02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:11.960
But Russian assassins were able to poison Kolkhoff

02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:14.160
with polonium.

02:50:14.160 --> 02:50:15.760
What happens to him is insane

02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:18.480
and it's a miracle he didn't die, but he doesn't.

02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:20.680
And then he defects to the West and he writes these books

02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:23.080
and he tells lots of incredible secrets

02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:25.480
about the Russian assassination programs

02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:27.360
and their poison labs.

02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:28.960
And they're really, really, really interesting.

02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:30.560
And so to answer that question,

02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:32.940
I mean, to my eye, of course I don't know,

02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:35.920
but it certainly looks like Russia is acting

02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:39.160
in the same vein that it has always acted,

02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:42.100
taking care of dissidents that go against Mother Russia.

02:50:43.080 --> 02:50:46.460
So in the style of KGB assassinations,

02:50:49.380 --> 02:50:51.480
is there something you can comment on

02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:56.720
about the ways that KGB operates versus the CIA

02:50:56.720 --> 02:50:59.480
when we look at the history of the two organizations,

02:50:59.480 --> 02:51:04.480
the Cold War, after World War II, and leading up to today?

02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:08.820
I mean, my feeling on that is always that

02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:15.340
there's a thread somewhere in declassified documentation

02:51:16.640 --> 02:51:20.400
about these programs of America working

02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:27.200
to maintain a semblance of democratic ideals,

02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:31.440
however surprising that may be, right?

02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:36.020
In other words, always trying to,

02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:38.480
I don't wanna say fight fair

02:51:38.480 --> 02:51:40.520
because killing people isn't fair,

02:51:40.520 --> 02:51:45.520
but versus a certain ruthlessness,

02:51:46.320 --> 02:51:51.320
a real sinister totalitarian type ruthlessness,

02:51:54.720 --> 02:51:56.700
certainly from Soviet Russia.

02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:01.040
I'm far less familiar with modern day

02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:03.440
Russian assassination activities,

02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:07.560
although we certainly know on the record that they exist.

02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:09.800
Some people have done great reporting on that.

02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:15.640
But there seems to be a kind of almost sadism

02:52:17.480 --> 02:52:21.280
about the Russian programs that I personally have not seen

02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:24.560
in the American programs.

02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:26.660
What about on the surveillance side?

02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:31.120
It seems like America is pretty good at mass surveillance,

02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:33.240
or at least has been revealed through NSA

02:52:33.240 --> 02:52:38.240
and all this kind of reporting and leaks

02:52:38.320 --> 02:52:39.620
and whistleblowers.

02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:44.280
Can you comment to the degree to how much surveillance

02:52:44.280 --> 02:52:47.580
is done by the US government internally and externally?

02:52:49.400 --> 02:52:50.920
If you'd asked me five years ago,

02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:52.540
I would have a very different answer, right?

02:52:52.540 --> 02:52:54.700
Because, all right, first of all,

02:52:54.700 --> 02:52:56.320
they're looking for a needle in the haystack,

02:52:56.320 --> 02:52:57.520
they're looking for the bin Laden,

02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:59.380
and they can't find the needle in the haystack,

02:52:59.380 --> 02:53:01.680
but they continue to create the haystack

02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:04.280
and survey the haystack, right?

02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:07.600
Okay, but the real problem, what has happened,

02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:09.680
and I write about this in my book, First Platoon,

02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:11.400
which is about a group of young soldiers

02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:14.760
who goes to Afghanistan and unwittingly becomes part

02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:19.760
of the Defense Department's efforts to capture biometrics

02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:24.040
on 85% of the population of Afghanistan, okay?

02:53:24.040 --> 02:53:27.040
Which, by the way, China then emulated

02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:30.280
in their own biometric surveillance program, right?

02:53:30.280 --> 02:53:33.920
And I think this is a terrible idea.

02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:37.160
But what has happened, these biometric systems

02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:39.000
that have been created, and biometrics are,

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:44.000
of course, fingerprints, facial images, DNA, and iris scans,

02:53:45.640 --> 02:53:50.640
that allow you to tag, track, and locate people, okay?

02:53:51.240 --> 02:53:54.040
And what has happened in the five years

02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:57.620
since this question was first on everybody's minds

02:53:57.620 --> 02:54:02.620
about NSA surveillance is that the civilian sector companies

02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:06.920
have essentially done all the Defense Department's

02:54:07.560 --> 02:54:09.320
biometric surveillance job for them.

02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:14.120
By all of us sharing our facially recognizable images

02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:17.060
on Instagram and Facebook and everywhere else, X,

02:54:18.480 --> 02:54:21.040
by sharing information, by writing up narratives

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:26.040
about ourselves, this information has become part

02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:28.800
of the database.

02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:31.040
Five years ago, when I was reporting First Platoon,

02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:34.160
I was interviewing the police chief of El Segundo,

02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:36.200
which is kind of like on the outskirts of LA,

02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:37.720
it's right near the airport.

02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:39.160
And why it's important is because it's like

02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:41.420
defense contractor haven, okay?

02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:45.000
So they have massive surveillance.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.240
And Chief Whalen, when I posed this question to him,

02:54:47.240 --> 02:54:49.840
he said to me, Annie, let me show you something.

02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:54.280
And he had Clearwater AI, the recognition software,

02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:56.600
on his phone, and this was still when it was like

02:54:56.600 --> 02:55:00.800
quasi not supposed to have to have that for law enforcement.

02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:02.840
And he said, I want you to go down the block,

02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:05.000
and I want you to just turn the corner

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.040
and come back toward me, right?

02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:08.160
Which I did.

02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:10.680
And he just didn't even hold up his phone.

02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:12.720
He just kind of looked like his hand

02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:14.280
and his phone was on me.

02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:17.300
And he went back down, it was like tiniest movement.

02:55:17.300 --> 02:55:19.100
And when I came back to him, he went like this

02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:24.100
and he showed me, there I was, everything about me,

02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:29.600
everything about me, facts and figures and all images.

02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:33.160
And he knew who I was before I even got to him.

02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:36.960
So is that a good thing or a bad thing?

02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:39.080
I mean, we could have another three hour conversation

02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:40.720
about that alone.

02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:45.320
So you're saying more and more, you don't need an NSA

02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:48.120
where we're giving over the data ourselves.

02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:49.160
Yeah.

02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:51.160
Publicly or semi publicly.

02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:52.000
Yeah.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.280
During the war on terror, people were just like incensed

02:55:54.280 --> 02:55:56.920
to learn that there's a drone that's flying

02:55:56.920 --> 02:55:58.760
at something like 20,000 feet.

02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:00.920
It's called Argus is, right?

02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:05.960
And it can capture the, it's not a license plate.

02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:08.520
It's like, it can basically capture like what's written

02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:12.480
on a golf ball from 17,000 feet, 20,000 feet up, okay?

02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:14.320
And people went crazy over this.

02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:17.760
Like, oh my God, it's big brother.

02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:21.360
Well, one of the lead engineers on that, Pat Bilkin

02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:22.680
is someone I talk to regularly

02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:24.160
because we talk about surveillance a lot

02:56:24.160 --> 02:56:26.400
because he thinks about it a lot because he has kids now.

02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:31.000
And he has given so much thoughtful, you know,

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.720
really thinks about this issue because he believes

02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:36.880
just like you stated that what we are turning over

02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:39.600
about ourselves actually exceeds anything

02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:41.960
that Argus is could do from above

02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:43.560
because we're doing it willfully.

02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:46.440
And so what it's doing is it's creating an ability

02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:49.520
for if someone wants to know about you,

02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:52.320
if someone let's say in government wants to know

02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:55.960
about Lex Friedman, they can find out everything about you.

02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:59.040
And then that gets used for tagging, tracking.

02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:02.640
And ultimately, you know, in the war theater,

02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:04.320
it was called find, fix, finish.

02:57:04.320 --> 02:57:07.720
Well, what do you think the finish is in that statement?

02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:08.600
It's not pleasant.

02:57:08.600 --> 02:57:10.080
It's called a drone strike.

02:57:10.080 --> 02:57:10.920
Yeah.

02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:14.640
Find, find him with the biometric, fix him,

02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:16.280
meaning fix his position.

02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:18.160
We know he's moving in a car.

02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:20.520
That's him, that's him, finish him.

02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:23.600
Call it in, drone strike, boom.

02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:26.960
If we could return to nuclear war,

02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:32.560
you've briefly mentioned that a lot of things

02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:36.920
go back to the Third Reich and Hitler.

02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:39.240
If we go back to World War II,

02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:42.280
we look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:43.760
the dropping of the two bombs.

02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:48.000
I would love to get your opinion on whether we should

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:49.640
or shouldn't have done that.

02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:52.520
And also to get your opinion on what would have happened

02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:56.480
if Hitler and Germany built the bomb first.

02:57:56.480 --> 02:57:57.720
Do you think it was possible

02:57:57.720 --> 02:57:59.480
he could have built the bomb first?

02:58:01.280 --> 02:58:06.280
In my researching Third Reich weapons

02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:08.160
for Operation Paperclip, because of course,

02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:11.320
we got a lot of those scientists after.

02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:12.520
Which is another great book

02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.600
in a terrifyingly complicated operation.

02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:17.440
Yes.

02:58:18.520 --> 02:58:20.840
When, you know, at what point do the ends

02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:22.680
justify the means, right?

02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:26.040
But in looking at those programs

02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:30.200
and we acquired Hitler's favorite weapons designers.

02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:32.400
And I'm talking about weapons of mass destruction

02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:35.120
like chemical weapons and biological weapons.

02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:38.400
But of course, America was ahead in the nuclear program

02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:42.280
and an interesting detail reading Albert Speer's memoirs

02:58:42.280 --> 02:58:47.280
was Speer referring to a conversation he had with Hitler

02:58:47.400 --> 02:58:51.320
where Hitler said, no, I don't wanna do that.

02:58:51.320 --> 02:58:53.640
That's Jewish science.

02:58:53.640 --> 02:58:58.640
And so because of Hitler's own racial ethnic prejudices,

02:58:59.600 --> 02:59:01.840
they didn't develop the bomb, right?

02:59:01.840 --> 02:59:05.800
As far as should we have dropped the bombs on Hiroshima,

02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:07.800
you know, I've interviewed all kinds of people

02:59:07.800 --> 02:59:11.520
with different opinions, most of them that had ended the war.

02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:15.320
The best interview and most meaningful perhaps that I ever did

02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:17.840
was with Al O'Donnell who was a participant

02:59:17.840 --> 02:59:21.320
in the battle of Okinawa, which was like this insane,

02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:25.200
just to read stories about Okinawa,

02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:27.960
it makes your hair stand on end.

02:59:27.960 --> 02:59:31.360
And O'Donnell, like so many others,

02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:36.360
was slated to invade mainland Japan

02:59:38.240 --> 02:59:40.680
to his almost certain death, right?

02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:44.000
So somebody like that, it makes sense, right?

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:48.880
From the get go, why he would be pro nuclear weapons.

02:59:48.880 --> 02:59:51.320
It saved his own personal life

02:59:51.320 --> 02:59:55.200
and it saved everyone that he knew that he was fighting with

02:59:55.200 --> 02:59:57.400
and it ended the war.

02:59:58.240 --> 03:00:00.560
Do you think it sent a signal?

03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:03.160
Like without that, we wouldn't have known perhaps

03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:05.440
about the power of the weapons.

03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:10.440
So in the long arc of that history, 70 years plus,

03:00:11.280 --> 03:00:16.280
it is the reason why deterrence has worked so far.

03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:20.720
Yes, that's an interesting thought.

03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:25.720
My thought goes to this idea of more, right?

03:00:25.880 --> 03:00:27.880
That everybody always wants more.

03:00:27.880 --> 03:00:31.760
It's a very dangerous, it's like more power, literally,

03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:34.080
not just figure it, more power, right?

03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:38.080
And what is more confounding to me,

03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:44.040
beyond the fact that we dropped two atomic bombs

03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:47.760
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the war ended,

03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:50.680
is that this decision was then made

03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:54.040
to develop the thermonuclear bomb,

03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:56.760
a force that is such,

03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:01.080
the degree of magnitude of that power is mind boggling.

03:01:01.080 --> 03:01:05.720
I mean, even projects within the Manhattan Project

03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:08.640
defined thermonuclear weapon,

03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:12.280
the thermonuclear weapon as the evil thing.

03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:15.600
Like it was evil, it's a weapon of genocide.

03:01:15.600 --> 03:01:19.160
Atomic weapons destroy cities.

03:01:22.160 --> 03:01:26.040
Thermonuclear weapons destroy civilizations.

03:01:27.800 --> 03:01:30.840
You open the book with a Churchill quote.

03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:34.000
The story of the human race is war,

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:37.480
except for brief and precarious interludes.

03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:40.240
There has never been peace in the world.

03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:42.600
And before history began,

03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:46.720
murderous strife was universal and unending.

03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:50.760
Do you think there will always be war?

03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:56.360
Do you think that there is some deep human way

03:01:56.360 --> 03:02:00.960
in which we're tending to this kind of global war, eternally?

03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:04.800
Well, the optimistic answer of that would be

03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:08.280
that we could evolve beyond that, right?

03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:12.280
Because certainly if we look at our ancestors,

03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:16.720
they had not developed their consciousness

03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:21.720
as far as we have to be able to build the tools that we have.

03:02:23.840 --> 03:02:27.800
And so the hopeful answer is we will evolve

03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:32.560
beyond this kind of brute force,

03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:34.520
kill the other guy attitude.

03:02:36.520 --> 03:02:39.600
Certainly, you know, these are questions

03:02:39.600 --> 03:02:42.960
that will become more obvious over time.

03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:47.880
I just want to play my little part in this world

03:02:47.880 --> 03:02:51.080
that I live in as the storyteller

03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:53.960
who brings information to people

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:58.080
so that they can have these kind of questions

03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:02.760
with themselves, with their friends, with their families.

03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:05.800
And I think in asking that very question,

03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:07.640
what you're really saying is,

03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:12.640
why don't we evolve beyond war fighting?

03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:17.080
It is very possible.

03:03:17.080 --> 03:03:20.920
And your book is such a stark and powerful reminder

03:03:20.920 --> 03:03:24.960
that human civilization as we know it ends in this century.

03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:31.360
Let's say it's a good motivator to get our shit together.

03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:40.160
But aren't you really saying human civilization could end,

03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:41.480
not it ends?

03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:43.760
Could end.

03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:44.600
Could end.

03:03:46.200 --> 03:03:49.640
But the power of our weapons is growing rapidly.

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:52.080
So.

03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:54.880
As they say, it's time to come back from the brink, right?

03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:56.960
And it's time to have that discussion

03:03:56.960 --> 03:03:58.840
while we're still talking.

03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:02.720
And, you know, there's another complexity

03:04:02.720 --> 03:04:04.320
sneaking up into the picture

03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:07.800
in the form of artificial intelligence.

03:04:07.800 --> 03:04:12.800
And in cyber war, but also in hot war,

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:14.960
the use of autonomous weapons,

03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:18.480
all of it starts becoming super complicated

03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:22.720
as we delegate some of these decisions about war,

03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:24.440
including nuclear war,

03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:25.680
to more and more autonomy

03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:28.000
and artificial intelligence systems.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.840
It's gonna be a very interesting century.

03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:33.800
Do you, just to zoom out a little bit,

03:04:33.800 --> 03:04:36.880
hope that we become a multi-planetary species?

03:04:36.880 --> 03:04:38.280
I'm all for adventure.

03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:43.280
And I too, while I'm for adventure,

03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:47.920
I'm all for backups in all forms.

03:04:47.920 --> 03:04:51.320
So I hope that humans start a civilization on Mars

03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:53.280
and beyond out in space.

03:04:54.240 --> 03:04:56.320
And if you zoom out across all of it,

03:04:56.320 --> 03:05:00.480
what gives you hope about human civilization,

03:05:00.480 --> 03:05:02.720
about this whole thing we have going on here?

03:05:02.720 --> 03:05:06.000
I mean, I am a fundamentally optimistic person.

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:07.800
I must've come out of the chute that way

03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:09.480
because I just am, right?

03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:12.480
Even though I write about really grim things,

03:05:12.480 --> 03:05:15.520
I get inspired by them

03:05:15.520 --> 03:05:17.920
because I do always believe in evolution, right?

03:05:17.920 --> 03:05:20.800
I also have like the greatest family ever,

03:05:20.800 --> 03:05:22.800
two kids, Jett and Finley.

03:05:22.800 --> 03:05:25.320
Shout out to them, they're Lex Friedman fans.

03:05:25.320 --> 03:05:26.160
You know?

03:05:26.160 --> 03:05:29.720
And my husband.

03:05:29.720 --> 03:05:32.120
And you know, so what inspires me

03:05:32.120 --> 03:05:33.600
is like this idea of legacy.

03:05:33.600 --> 03:05:37.080
I think that you always wanna have your eye

03:05:37.080 --> 03:05:40.480
on being a good example to the best that you can.

03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:43.800
And so, and passing on what you know

03:05:43.800 --> 03:05:47.360
and believing kind of in the next generation.

03:05:47.360 --> 03:05:49.480
And again, that's a sentiment echoed

03:05:49.480 --> 03:05:51.760
by all these cold warriors I've been talking to

03:05:51.760 --> 03:05:53.920
because they also share that.

03:05:55.200 --> 03:05:59.080
That idea that, wow, look at what we have done

03:05:59.080 --> 03:06:01.280
as a civilization and look where we're going,

03:06:01.280 --> 03:06:06.280
whether it's exoplanetary travel or AI.

03:06:08.240 --> 03:06:12.920
It's just that the human factor of like the desire to fight,

03:06:12.920 --> 03:06:17.920
the desire to have conflict needs to be reconfigured

03:06:18.640 --> 03:06:22.920
because with all these new technologies that we have,

03:06:22.920 --> 03:06:27.280
the peril is growing at an accelerating pace,

03:06:27.280 --> 03:06:31.240
perhaps faster than the average human can keep up with.

03:06:31.240 --> 03:06:34.720
Well, Annie, thank you for being a wonderful example

03:06:34.720 --> 03:06:38.840
of a great journalist, a great writer, a great human being.

03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:41.000
And I'm a big fan of yours.

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.680
It's a huge honor to meet you, to talk with you today.

03:06:43.680 --> 03:06:46.080
So thank you so much for talking today.

03:06:46.080 --> 03:06:48.000
Thank you for having me.

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:49.640
Thank you for listening to this conversation

03:06:49.640 --> 03:06:51.120
with Annie Jacobson.

03:06:51.120 --> 03:06:52.320

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:56.960
And now let me leave you with some words

03:06:56.960 --> 03:06:58.720
from John F. Kennedy.

03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:03.480
The very word secrecy is repugnant

03:07:03.480 --> 03:07:05.400
in a free and open society.

03:07:05.400 --> 03:07:07.680
And we are as a people inherently

03:07:07.680 --> 03:07:10.240
and historically opposed to secret societies,

03:07:10.240 --> 03:07:13.720
to secret oaths and to secret proceedings.

03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:18.160
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
