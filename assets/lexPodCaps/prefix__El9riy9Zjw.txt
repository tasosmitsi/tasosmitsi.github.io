00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
It's a sad state of affairs when our,

00:02.760 --> 00:06.040
some of the most influential voices in our country

00:06.040 --> 00:11.040
will label someone a lover or supporter of dictators

00:11.200 --> 00:12.960
simply because you're saying,

00:12.960 --> 00:16.640
hey, we shouldn't be going to war.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.040
There is another way.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.400
The following is a conversation with Tulsi Gabbard,

00:23.400 --> 00:25.680
who was a longtime Democrat,

00:25.680 --> 00:27.960
including being the vice chair

00:27.960 --> 00:29.920
of the Democratic National Committee.

00:29.960 --> 00:34.600
She endorsed Bernie in 2016 and Biden in 2020.

00:34.600 --> 00:38.280
She has been both loved and heavily criticized

00:38.280 --> 00:41.520
for her independent thinking and bold political stances,

00:41.520 --> 00:43.760
especially on topics of war

00:43.760 --> 00:46.280
and the military industrial complex.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.200
She served in the US military for many years,

00:49.200 --> 00:51.440
achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.380
And now she's the author of a new book

00:54.380 --> 00:56.960
called For Love of Country.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.840
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.200

01:03.200 --> 01:06.960
And now, dear friends, here's Tulsi Gabbard.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.520
You've served in the US military for many years,

01:11.520 --> 01:14.160
achieving rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.560
You were deployed in Iraq in 2004 and five,

01:17.560 --> 01:20.160
Kuwait in 2008 and nine.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.560
What lessons about life and about country

01:22.560 --> 01:25.440
have you learned from that experience of war?

01:25.480 --> 01:26.600
So many.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.080
Central to those lessons learned

01:29.080 --> 01:33.840
was having my eyes open to the very real cost of war.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.600
Of course, I served in a medical unit

01:37.600 --> 01:39.920
during that first deployment to Iraq.

01:39.920 --> 01:43.240
It was 2005 during the height of that war.

01:43.240 --> 01:47.080
And unfortunately, we took a lot of casualties.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.080
We, across the entire US military,

01:50.080 --> 01:51.800
my brigade that I deployed with

01:51.800 --> 01:53.800
was from the Hawaii National Guard.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.880
We had approximately 3,000 soldiers

01:55.880 --> 02:00.880
who were operating in four different areas of Iraq.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.720
And my first task every day

02:04.720 --> 02:08.120
was to go through a list of every injury,

02:08.120 --> 02:09.960
combat-related injury that had occurred

02:09.960 --> 02:13.400
the day before in the country.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.800
And I went through that list, name by name,

02:18.800 --> 02:22.200
looking to see if any one of our nearly 3,000 soldiers

02:22.200 --> 02:26.200
from Hawaii had been hurt in the line of duty.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.880
And then if seeing them on the list,

02:29.880 --> 02:31.800
tracking them down, where were they?

02:31.800 --> 02:33.800
Were they getting the care they needed?

02:33.800 --> 02:35.760
Would they be able to get sufficient care

02:35.760 --> 02:38.680
to stay in country and return to duty?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.800
Did I need to get them evacuated?

02:40.800 --> 02:44.080
Usually it would be to military hospitals

02:44.080 --> 02:47.560
that at that time were in Landstuhl and Ramstein in Germany.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.800
And then from there, getting them to either

02:51.760 --> 02:54.160
Brooke Army Medical Center, which is here in Texas,

02:54.160 --> 02:57.000
that specialized in burn-related injuries

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
or to Walter Reed, and tracking them and their care

03:01.000 --> 03:05.360
until they were finally home with their families.

03:05.360 --> 03:08.680
And it never became a routine task.

03:08.680 --> 03:13.680
It never became like, okay, cool, check the list,

03:13.680 --> 03:16.760
kind of dot the I's, cross the T's.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.600
It was that daily confrontation

03:19.600 --> 03:22.200
with the reality of the cost of war.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.440
Friends of mine were killed in combat.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.720
Experiencing firsthand that high human cost of war

03:30.720 --> 03:33.440
caused me, you know, 20-something year old from Hawaii,

03:33.440 --> 03:37.120
I had left my seat in the state legislature to volunteer

03:37.120 --> 03:41.560
to deploy with my brothers and sisters in my unit to Iraq.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.920
And so recognize the cost of war,

03:43.920 --> 03:45.400
I think in two fundamental ways.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.800
Number one is the high human cost of war on our troops

03:48.840 --> 03:50.160
and on the people in the country

03:50.160 --> 03:51.720
where this war was being waged.

03:51.720 --> 03:56.320
And also the cost on American taxpayers.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.080
Seeing then back, again, 2005,

03:59.080 --> 04:02.280
and recognizing KBR Halliburton,

04:02.280 --> 04:06.000
one of the biggest defense contracting companies then.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.160
And I know that they are still very much

04:08.160 --> 04:09.480
in that business now.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.680
Dick Cheney being connected with that company

04:12.680 --> 04:14.520
at one point or another.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.920
But in our camp specifically,

04:15.920 --> 04:18.720
which was one of the larger ones in Iraq at that time,

04:20.240 --> 04:23.880
there wasn't anything that happened in our camp

04:23.880 --> 04:28.400
that didn't have the KBR Halliburton logo imprinted on it.

04:28.400 --> 04:32.520
We had a big shack looking place where we ate our meals.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.760
They call it a dining facility, a DFAC in the military.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.840
And they served four meals a day.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.480
They brought in and they being KBR Halliburton,

04:40.480 --> 04:42.800
they imported workers in from places like Nepal

04:42.800 --> 04:45.560
and Sri Lanka and the Philippines to come in and cook food.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.280
And work at this dining facility.

04:48.280 --> 04:53.280
I got curious about how much it costs us as taxpayers.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.680
And so I started asking around some of the people.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.120
And I think at that time it was like,

04:57.120 --> 04:59.760
well, every time a soldier or a service member

04:59.760 --> 05:01.680
walks through the door,

05:01.680 --> 05:03.280
if I were to go in for breakfast

05:03.280 --> 05:05.280
and grab a banana and walk out,

05:05.280 --> 05:09.480
that's an automatic $35 per head,

05:09.480 --> 05:11.640
per meal, four times a day,

05:11.640 --> 05:13.560
thousands and thousands of people.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.960
And then we made friends.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.440
There's a pretty large Filipino community in Hawaii.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.960
A lot of Filipino soldiers from Hawaii.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.880
We made friends with the Filipino workers who were there.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.760
They would often go in like the back of the tents

05:23.760 --> 05:26.000
and set up their own like rice cookers

05:26.000 --> 05:27.800
and cook their own meals,

05:27.800 --> 05:29.960
which is where the real good food was.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.120
But just started talking to them and getting to know them

05:32.120 --> 05:34.280
and ask like, hey, how much do you get paid?

05:34.280 --> 05:35.560
And on average, it was like,

05:35.560 --> 05:38.240
oh, I get paid like 500 bucks a month,

05:38.240 --> 05:41.000
500 bucks a month to go and do this work

05:41.000 --> 05:44.400
of either cleaning out porta potties,

05:44.400 --> 05:47.200
picking up trash, the dining facility, doing laundry,

05:47.200 --> 05:49.160
all of these different tasks

05:49.160 --> 05:52.760
because the military wanted soldiers to be out

05:52.760 --> 05:56.880
doing things that only soldiers could do, understandable.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.400
But when I started putting two and two together

05:59.400 --> 06:01.800
and knowing that this company,

06:01.800 --> 06:05.080
one company alone was making trillions of dollars,

06:05.080 --> 06:06.720
trillions of dollars,

06:06.720 --> 06:11.720
and yet this Filipino mom is making 500 bucks a month,

06:12.680 --> 06:14.440
maybe getting one day off a week,

06:14.440 --> 06:17.280
maybe working 12 hours a day otherwise.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.240
And I said, how often are you able to go home

06:20.240 --> 06:21.080
to your family?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.640
Well, they'll let us go home a couple of weeks

06:23.640 --> 06:25.320
every other year.

06:25.320 --> 06:30.320
It was an eye-opening experience that growing up in Hawaii,

06:30.320 --> 06:33.640
I frankly hadn't given much thought to before,

06:34.640 --> 06:37.000
but it's what led me ultimately coming back

06:37.000 --> 06:38.760
from that first deployment.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.280
There was no way that I could go back to the life

06:41.560 --> 06:43.360
that I had left behind.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.280
And I knew somehow, some way,

06:46.280 --> 06:51.040
I needed to find a way to use those experiences

06:51.040 --> 06:53.640
to try to make a positive impact,

06:53.640 --> 06:57.120
to try to influence those,

06:57.120 --> 06:58.960
I mean, frankly, the politicians

06:58.960 --> 07:00.680
who were making decisions to go

07:01.680 --> 07:03.720
and launch these regime change wars

07:03.720 --> 07:07.600
and send our men and women in uniform into war

07:07.600 --> 07:10.600
and to what end, ultimately?

07:11.400 --> 07:13.600
If we can just go back to that list.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.920
So the list is just name and injury, name and injury.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.440
Name, unit, potentially location,

07:21.440 --> 07:24.920
if someone had documented that and their injury.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.640
And it's just pages and pages of that.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.480
Yeah, yeah.

07:28.480 --> 07:31.880
And I knew, I didn't get to call home every day,

07:31.880 --> 07:36.880
but when I called home and talked to my parents,

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
I felt the tension in their voice.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.200
And they didn't want me to worry about anything at home.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.000
And so they were always like, hey, how are you?

07:47.000 --> 07:47.880
What can we send you?

07:47.880 --> 07:49.560
And this and that.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.640
But it wasn't like I was calling them

07:52.640 --> 07:54.440
from down the street and saying, hey, how's it going?

07:54.440 --> 07:56.600
Let's go have lunch or whatever.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.800
And so I knew that the reason for that tension

08:01.800 --> 08:05.360
was they were terrified of getting a phone call,

08:05.400 --> 08:08.280
delivering the worst possible news.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.960
And that was what I thought of

08:09.960 --> 08:14.960
as I went through that list of how it is the reality of war.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.680
Behind every one of those names on that list

08:18.680 --> 08:23.680
was a husband or a wife, parents, sons and daughters,

08:24.320 --> 08:27.440
family members who had no idea

08:27.440 --> 08:28.800
what we were dealing with, really.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.560
All they knew is what they saw on the news.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.560
And what my dad told me later when I got home

08:35.880 --> 08:39.160
after that deployment was that every time they saw the news

08:39.160 --> 08:44.160
and they saw a helicopter shot down or crashed or some IED,

08:46.160 --> 08:50.280
they held their breath until they saw or heard the news

08:50.280 --> 08:53.880
of who it was or what it was.

08:53.880 --> 08:58.160
What can you say about what the soldiers had to go through

08:58.160 --> 09:01.400
physically and psychologically when they get injured?

09:02.400 --> 09:07.400
The physical, some injuries appeared to be minor upfront.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.560
At that time, traumatic brain injury was not something

09:13.560 --> 09:16.440
that was talked about much, if at all.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.520
And so many had visible wounds,

09:21.520 --> 09:24.600
others are now what we know appeared like,

09:24.600 --> 09:28.640
all right, cool, you checked out, but had invisible wounds.

09:28.640 --> 09:33.080
Those who were injured in a way that did not allow them

09:33.080 --> 09:38.080
to get back to work found it emotionally very difficult

09:38.320 --> 09:41.280
to be put on a plane and evacuated out of there,

09:42.240 --> 09:45.880
feeling guilty that they were leaving their friends behind

09:45.880 --> 09:50.880
and not thinking about themselves

09:50.920 --> 09:52.640
or not feeling bad for themselves,

09:52.640 --> 09:55.640
but instead feeling bad for being forced

09:55.640 --> 09:57.160
to be in a position to leave.

09:59.040 --> 10:03.440
For soldiers, it's not, of course,

10:03.440 --> 10:06.480
we all have our own political opinions on things,

10:06.480 --> 10:10.000
but when it comes right down to it in a war zone,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.920
it's about your friends, it's about your brothers

10:11.920 --> 10:14.120
and sisters that you're serving alongside.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.760
It's not about the politicians

10:15.760 --> 10:18.640
or whatever insanity is going on in Washington.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.120
It's about getting up and going out,

10:22.120 --> 10:25.520
getting the job done and coming back home together.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.160
I mean, I had friends of mine who were from Hawaii,

10:29.160 --> 10:30.680
who were from American Samoa,

10:30.680 --> 10:34.320
very culturally tight-knit community

10:34.320 --> 10:39.320
who confided in me throughout that year that we were there,

10:39.680 --> 10:41.720
some of the very infantry soldiers

10:41.720 --> 10:43.800
who were going out on security patrols

10:43.800 --> 10:45.560
and doing raids every day,

10:47.040 --> 10:51.880
just some of the very traumatic experiences

10:51.880 --> 10:54.000
that they went through.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.840
No physical injury,

10:55.840 --> 11:00.840
but creating a kind of emotional stress and trauma

11:02.560 --> 11:06.520
that as human beings, they were struggling in dealing with.

11:08.280 --> 11:12.080
On a positive note, the Polynesian culture especially,

11:12.080 --> 11:15.040
but also Asian culture and other cultures around the world,

11:15.040 --> 11:17.080
our guys found that as they were,

11:17.080 --> 11:19.280
shortly after we got there,

11:19.280 --> 11:21.640
the unit that we were replacing,

11:21.640 --> 11:23.320
we're taking the guys out on patrol and saying,

11:23.400 --> 11:24.360
hey, here's this village.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.040
Here's where we found friendlies

11:26.040 --> 11:29.400
or here's where we know that there are insurgents operating

11:29.400 --> 11:31.840
and they've got allies and lookouts

11:31.840 --> 11:35.080
and showing them the lay of the land, basically.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.440
And what our guys found was

11:37.440 --> 11:39.240
that as they were doing these ride-alongs,

11:39.240 --> 11:41.280
they call it a left seat, right seat,

11:41.280 --> 11:43.280
when you're coming in and taking over,

11:44.640 --> 11:48.840
that there was a bit of a tense,

11:48.840 --> 11:51.720
even adversarial type of relationship

11:51.720 --> 11:54.560
where on the military side,

11:54.560 --> 11:59.560
there was an assumption of suspicion or lack of trust,

11:59.880 --> 12:01.920
just with the local Iraqi people

12:01.920 --> 12:04.200
who lived around the base that we were at.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.360
And without anybody telling them to culturally,

12:07.360 --> 12:11.840
our guys began trying to build relationships.

12:11.840 --> 12:16.800
And for Hawaii and Samoa,

12:16.800 --> 12:19.760
and we had soldiers from Guam and Saipan,

12:19.760 --> 12:23.400
little things like you're riding down in a Humvee,

12:23.400 --> 12:25.360
you've got a gunner in the turret

12:25.360 --> 12:28.760
with a 50 cal or a machine gun of some sort,

12:28.760 --> 12:31.800
little things like pointing the muzzle to the sky

12:31.800 --> 12:33.480
as you're riding through a town,

12:33.480 --> 12:36.480
rather than pointing it directly at where people

12:36.480 --> 12:38.240
are walking down the street,

12:38.240 --> 12:40.920
was a huge gesture of an assumption of,

12:40.920 --> 12:45.160
hey, let's actually talk and become friends.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.080
We had our guys riding down the street

12:47.120 --> 12:51.400
and throwing shakas out to the local people there,

12:51.400 --> 12:54.320
breaking bread, sharing tea and building those relationships.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.520
And again, I served in a medical unit

12:56.520 --> 13:01.520
and what we saw was a downward shift in casualties

13:03.000 --> 13:05.240
from the unit that had been there before us,

13:05.240 --> 13:10.160
simply because of that basic human connection

13:10.160 --> 13:11.560
that our guys sought to make.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.880
And then gradually finding like, hey, local,

13:13.880 --> 13:16.720
people who lived in the town right next to us were saying,

13:17.360 --> 13:18.320
hey, you guys should really,

13:18.320 --> 13:20.840
somebody was digging a big hole down this,

13:20.840 --> 13:22.600
a mile down the road.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.800
You might wanna bypass that or check that out

13:24.800 --> 13:27.480
and finding weapons caches and IEDs

13:27.480 --> 13:30.520
and provides explosive devices and other things

13:30.520 --> 13:32.720
that helped save people's lives.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.040
On the cost side of things,

13:36.040 --> 13:39.680
how is it possible for a company like Hal Burton or others

13:39.680 --> 13:43.000
to get away with $40 bananas or however much it was,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.040
the overhead costs?

13:45.040 --> 13:48.280
Look, what they will claim is that it's expensive

13:48.280 --> 13:52.600
to move logistics through a country at war,

13:54.240 --> 13:55.920
but they get away with it.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.920
Ultimately, these insane, this insane war profiteering

14:02.320 --> 14:03.200
and they're not alone.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.840
Obviously there are other companies

14:04.840 --> 14:07.040
that this is their business model.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.640
They get away with it because of their political connections

14:10.640 --> 14:13.040
and the lobbyists that they have,

14:13.040 --> 14:16.120
the relationships they have with politicians

14:16.120 --> 14:19.280
and ultimately what President Eisenhower warned against

14:19.280 --> 14:24.160
with regard to that cozy relationship between Congress

14:24.160 --> 14:26.360
and even what he called then

14:26.360 --> 14:28.920
the military industrial complex.

14:28.920 --> 14:32.360
It's been alive and well, he warned us against it

14:32.360 --> 14:37.360
and I would say it's thriving more now than ever before.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.200
How powerful is the military industrial complex?

14:41.240 --> 14:45.160
As a thing, is it a machine that can be slowed down,

14:45.160 --> 14:47.360
can be stopped, can be reversed?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.640
It can be, it's powerful.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.600
I don't think you can overstate the powerful nature of it

14:52.600 --> 14:57.600
because it extends so deeply within our government.

14:58.760 --> 15:02.280
It's not just those in these specific

15:02.280 --> 15:05.920
big defense contracting companies that benefit from it.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.720
You look at the revolving door within the Pentagon,

15:08.720 --> 15:12.280
for example, where you have both high ranking people

15:12.280 --> 15:14.560
who wear military uniforms,

15:14.560 --> 15:16.200
as well as those who serve

15:16.200 --> 15:19.920
as high ranking Department of Defense civilians

15:19.920 --> 15:23.520
who are literally working their way into a big payout

15:23.520 --> 15:26.080
when they leave that job.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.000
We see it with our own Secretary of Defense now.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.440
He retired as a general officer,

15:31.440 --> 15:34.800
went and served on one of the boards

15:34.800 --> 15:36.880
for one of the big defense contractors

15:36.880 --> 15:40.480
and then now back as the Secretary of Defense.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.960
We see the same thing in Congress with members of Congress

15:42.960 --> 15:45.160
and senior professional staffers in Congress.

15:45.160 --> 15:48.200
Same exact revolving door where you have people,

15:48.200 --> 15:49.600
whether they're writing contracts

15:49.600 --> 15:51.760
for the Department of Defense,

15:51.760 --> 15:54.680
for the company that then wins the bid for that contract

15:54.680 --> 15:56.880
and then going and working for that company,

15:56.880 --> 15:59.880
or those in Congress who are writing policies

15:59.880 --> 16:03.560
and doing exactly the same thing.

16:03.560 --> 16:08.520
You have been both a war hawk and a war dove at times.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.480
So what is your philosophy on when war is justified

16:11.480 --> 16:13.000
and when it is not?

16:13.000 --> 16:17.880
War is justified when it is in the best interest

16:17.880 --> 16:19.400
of our national security

16:20.880 --> 16:24.440
and when it is the last resort,

16:25.360 --> 16:29.360
when all diplomatic efforts have been completed

16:30.280 --> 16:35.280
and exhausted and war is the last possible route

16:36.880 --> 16:38.680
that must be taken to ensure the safety,

16:38.680 --> 16:41.040
security and freedom of the American people.

16:41.040 --> 16:44.120
So that's a high level, beautiful ideal,

16:44.120 --> 16:46.600
but there's messy details.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.480
So terrorism, for example.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.320
Yes.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.880
The United States involvement in the war in Iraq

16:51.880 --> 16:55.760
and Afghanistan was in part the big umbrella

16:55.760 --> 16:57.720
of the war on terrorism.

16:58.720 --> 17:03.080
So when you decide whether something's justified or not

17:03.080 --> 17:05.840
and whether something can be defeated or not,

17:05.840 --> 17:06.680
how hard is it?

17:06.680 --> 17:07.880
Is it even possible?

17:07.880 --> 17:10.640
To what degree is it possible to defeat terrorism?

17:11.600 --> 17:16.160
Well, first of all, part of the problem

17:16.160 --> 17:21.080
of our foreign policy has been how many conflicts, wars,

17:21.080 --> 17:23.800
military actions have been waged

17:23.800 --> 17:27.440
in the name of this quote unquote war on terrorism

17:28.080 --> 17:29.960
in the name of national security.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.320
Legislation like the Patriot Act that violates

17:32.320 --> 17:34.760
civil liberties, our civil liberties and freedoms

17:34.760 --> 17:38.920
in the name of the war on terrorism and national security

17:38.920 --> 17:40.960
when it's not justified.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.040
And so I'll use Afghanistan as an example.

17:44.040 --> 17:48.840
I support the initial mission that lifted off shortly

17:48.840 --> 17:50.400
after the attack on 9-11,

17:50.400 --> 17:52.720
the Islamist terrorist attack on 9-11.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.720
It was a relatively small group of US military

17:58.720 --> 18:02.720
launched to go after those Al-Qaeda cells

18:02.720 --> 18:05.200
and Osama bin Laden in the wake of that attack.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.360
That is the mission that should have been supported

18:09.360 --> 18:11.960
and focused on in its execution.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.520
Instead, as you know, it was,

18:15.920 --> 18:17.760
attention was diverted very quickly

18:17.760 --> 18:21.000
to the regime change war in Iraq

18:21.840 --> 18:25.520
that was waged on false pretenses.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.280
And the resources and focus was taken away

18:28.280 --> 18:32.520
from that initial mission that went to Afghanistan.

18:33.640 --> 18:37.800
And the war in Afghanistan blew up into something

18:37.800 --> 18:41.920
that became about regime change and governance

18:41.920 --> 18:45.400
and the Taliban and less focus on Al-Qaeda

18:45.400 --> 18:46.800
and Osama bin Laden.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.320
And it became this thing that even general officers

18:49.320 --> 18:53.480
had a hard time articulating.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.520
What is the objective here?

18:55.520 --> 18:56.840
What are we trying to accomplish?

18:56.840 --> 18:58.600
What does winning look like?

18:58.600 --> 19:03.600
At what point do we know it's time to exit and get out?

19:03.800 --> 19:08.080
And as you look at things like the Afghanistan files

19:08.080 --> 19:11.120
and others, the answers to these simple

19:11.120 --> 19:15.600
and essential questions shifted and changed over time,

19:15.600 --> 19:16.960
over a very long time.

19:17.920 --> 19:22.360
Similarly, in Iraq, I bought into a lot

19:22.360 --> 19:24.880
of what was being sold by the administration

19:24.880 --> 19:28.880
and by Democrats and Republicans and Congress at the time.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.920
And very quickly, even as I was on the ground there,

19:31.920 --> 19:33.320
started to have my eyes opened up

19:33.320 --> 19:38.320
into how we had been lied to tremendously

19:39.240 --> 19:41.640
and how that protracted war went on

19:41.640 --> 19:44.800
for a very, very long time with decisions being made

19:44.800 --> 19:48.280
that ultimately serve to strengthen terrorist groups

19:48.280 --> 19:52.120
like Al-Qaeda, the creation of ISIS and others,

19:52.120 --> 19:55.800
really undermining our national security interests

19:55.800 --> 19:56.640
in the meantime.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.360
Understanding the enemy that you are trying to defeat

20:01.360 --> 20:05.520
is essential to being able to build a strategy.

20:06.440 --> 20:11.040
The declaration of President Biden, for example,

20:11.040 --> 20:13.160
saying, well, the war on terror is over.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.120
The war on terror is over.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.560
What does that mean?

20:15.560 --> 20:17.440
Or the forever wars are over.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.280
Well, what does that actually mean?

20:21.080 --> 20:25.760
I served on my last most recent deployment in 2021

20:25.760 --> 20:28.320
to East Africa and Somalia,

20:28.320 --> 20:32.840
where Al-Shabaab is one of those Islamist terrorist groups

20:32.840 --> 20:37.160
that follows the same ideology as Al-Qaeda, ISIS,

20:37.160 --> 20:39.720
Hamas and others.

20:39.720 --> 20:44.040
This group has been allowed to grow and be strengthened,

20:44.040 --> 20:45.920
even though they are one of the main groups

20:45.920 --> 20:49.720
that provides funding to Al-Qaeda in that entire region.

20:49.720 --> 20:53.680
So any president or politician can declare a war to be over,

20:53.680 --> 20:58.200
but when you have an enemy like these Islamist terrorist

20:58.200 --> 21:01.960
groups who are still intent on their goal

21:01.960 --> 21:06.040
and their objective, which is to ultimately establish

21:06.040 --> 21:11.040
their Islamic caliphate and destroy Israel

21:11.040 --> 21:13.040
and exterminate the Jewish people

21:13.040 --> 21:16.800
and basically kill or convert anyone

21:16.800 --> 21:20.120
who doesn't adhere to their ideology.

21:20.120 --> 21:24.080
That continues on and they will only become stronger

21:24.080 --> 21:26.320
the longer our leaders put their heads in the sand

21:26.320 --> 21:28.800
and pretend like, oh no, this doesn't exist.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.320
This kind of war, this war specifically

21:32.320 --> 21:36.280
is one that has to be waged militarily and ideologically.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.440
And the ideological component to this,

21:38.440 --> 21:41.960
which is defeating their ideology with a superior one

21:41.960 --> 21:43.880
is one that I pointed out in Congress

21:43.880 --> 21:45.640
during the Obama administration.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.400
We, the collective we were failing at,

21:52.280 --> 21:54.000
the Obama administration was failing at

21:54.000 --> 21:57.520
because they were so afraid of being labeled Islamophobes

21:57.520 --> 22:00.480
that they refused to accurately identify

22:00.480 --> 22:02.920
the ideology driving these terrorist groups

22:02.920 --> 22:06.280
and instead said, oh, we are countering violent extremism

22:06.280 --> 22:09.960
was the term that the Obama administration started to use

22:09.960 --> 22:12.200
and was coined and kind of mandated

22:12.200 --> 22:14.560
across the US government.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.360
Well, you have to know, again,

22:17.360 --> 22:19.480
you have to know the enemy that threatens you

22:19.480 --> 22:21.640
and why they're doing what they're doing

22:21.640 --> 22:26.520
if you have any hope of actually preventing their attack,

22:26.520 --> 22:28.960
both militarily and as we're seeing now

22:29.200 --> 22:31.080
with Hamas's actions,

22:31.080 --> 22:34.040
not only directly in the assault on Israel,

22:34.040 --> 22:39.040
but how Hamas achieved their objectives

22:39.320 --> 22:43.680
in spreading their ideology around the world.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.760
If you look at the lessons learned

22:45.760 --> 22:50.040
from the US involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq,

22:50.040 --> 22:52.320
how do you fight terrorism?

22:52.320 --> 22:55.200
Clearly understanding who they are and where they are

22:55.200 --> 22:56.640
and why they're doing what they're doing

22:56.640 --> 22:58.200
is essential, first of all.

22:59.760 --> 23:03.280
And obviously there are different groups, different names,

23:03.280 --> 23:07.320
they have morphed and changed based on their locale

23:07.320 --> 23:08.880
and how they operate.

23:09.960 --> 23:14.160
Building relationships with people in other countries,

23:14.160 --> 23:16.960
both state leaders as well as religious leaders

23:16.960 --> 23:20.040
and others who share that same objective

23:20.040 --> 23:24.720
of defeating these Islamist terrorists on both fronts

23:24.760 --> 23:29.640
and acting as a united front in taking that action.

23:29.640 --> 23:32.360
What exactly that action looks like,

23:32.360 --> 23:34.640
details on the ground dictate that,

23:34.640 --> 23:37.720
details about these different groups will dictate that.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.360
But we've seen examples of this before

23:39.360 --> 23:40.800
and I saw this in Somalia,

23:40.800 --> 23:45.800
we saw it in some cases in Iraq where, for example,

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
you have imams who recognize the threat

23:51.040 --> 23:54.240
that these terrorist groups pose to their own people

23:54.240 --> 23:58.480
and their own communities and exerting their influence

23:58.480 --> 24:03.480
in defeating the terrorist Islamist ideology

24:04.280 --> 24:06.960
with their own teachings of Islam

24:06.960 --> 24:10.800
and preaching peace amongst their people.

24:10.800 --> 24:14.720
War is ugly and it is messy.

24:14.720 --> 24:19.720
It is also an unfortunate reality of the world we live in.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.800
So while I firmly believe that we must always pursue peace,

24:26.400 --> 24:29.280
I'm not a pacifist, I'm a realist,

24:29.280 --> 24:34.120
and recognize that where there are these threats,

24:36.760 --> 24:41.280
we must do what we can to work towards that safety,

24:41.280 --> 24:44.560
that security, that freedom and peace that we all want.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.320
If we look at the perspective of Israel

24:47.320 --> 24:50.360
in the Israel-Gaza war going on now,

24:51.520 --> 24:56.520
what do you do with the fact that the death of a civilian

24:59.160 --> 25:03.480
serves as a catalyst, gives birth to hate,

25:03.480 --> 25:05.880
potentially generational hate?

25:05.880 --> 25:10.880
So in Israel's stated goal of destroying Hamas,

25:11.720 --> 25:14.320
they are creating immeasurable hate.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.480
What do you do with that?

25:16.480 --> 25:17.960
From a perspective of Israel,

25:17.960 --> 25:19.680
what is the correct action to take

25:19.680 --> 25:21.320
in response to October 7th?

25:21.320 --> 25:25.160
That's a complex question with a complex answer.

25:25.160 --> 25:29.880
I think Israel's approach has to be

25:29.880 --> 25:34.640
in recognizing that delineation as far as possible.

25:34.640 --> 25:39.640
And I know it's tough when you have a terrorist group

25:39.800 --> 25:43.160
like Hamas that is so interwoven

25:43.160 --> 25:46.480
within the community of people in Gaza,

25:47.880 --> 25:51.120
but to recognize that there should be,

25:51.120 --> 25:53.160
and there is a shared purpose there

25:53.160 --> 25:58.160
for the Palestinian people to be able to live free

25:58.640 --> 26:01.000
and in peace and not under the oppression

26:01.000 --> 26:02.760
of this terrorist group,

26:02.760 --> 26:06.440
just as the people of Israel would like to live in peace

26:06.440 --> 26:10.220
and free from the threat of attack from a terrorist group

26:10.220 --> 26:12.960
that wants to exterminate them.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.800
The complexities of what's going on in Israeli politics

26:16.800 --> 26:18.800
is I think a different conversation,

26:18.800 --> 26:22.000
but also one that is directly intertwined

26:22.000 --> 26:23.560
with the answer to this question.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.680
When you have some people in the Israeli government

26:25.680 --> 26:29.840
who don't want the Palestinian people in Gaza at all

26:29.840 --> 26:33.080
and want them to go and repatriate in other countries,

26:33.080 --> 26:34.540
I think that's a big problem.

26:34.540 --> 26:39.280
And that further exacerbates this hatred and resentment

26:39.280 --> 26:42.840
that continues to grow there.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.760
This is a generation's long challenge unfortunately

26:46.760 --> 26:51.760
of the resentment and tension that exists

26:52.200 --> 26:56.020
between many Israelis and many Palestinians

26:56.020 --> 27:01.020
that can only be resolved when there's strong leadership

27:01.040 --> 27:05.060
representing both peoples who are able and willing

27:05.060 --> 27:09.500
to come together and recognize that the only way forward

27:09.500 --> 27:12.460
is to let the past be in the past

27:12.460 --> 27:16.580
and find a way towards peace in the future.

27:16.580 --> 27:18.340
How do you think, how do you hope

27:18.340 --> 27:20.060
the war in Ukraine will end?

27:20.060 --> 27:21.740
The only way that this war ends

27:21.740 --> 27:24.920
is to do exactly what we're talking about.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.780
There has to be a brokered dialogue

27:30.140 --> 27:32.780
and conversation about peace

27:33.700 --> 27:36.260
that has to occur with representatives

27:36.260 --> 27:38.960
from Russia and Ukraine.

27:40.140 --> 27:44.220
It is really truly heartbreaking to see both

27:44.220 --> 27:49.220
how efforts that began just weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine

27:49.740 --> 27:52.140
to do exactly this were thwarted

27:53.020 --> 27:55.500
by the Biden-Harris administration

27:55.500 --> 27:59.180
and other Western powers has cost

27:59.180 --> 28:02.180
so many innocent people's lives.

28:02.180 --> 28:06.060
And this is where I get, I have friends in Ukraine.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.140
I've been there more than a few times.

28:08.140 --> 28:11.940
I've enjoyed and appreciated the time that I've spent there.

28:14.180 --> 28:18.120
When I hear from my friends about how afraid they are

28:18.120 --> 28:20.580
of their husbands being conscripted

28:20.580 --> 28:24.020
and feeling like they have to hide

28:24.020 --> 28:26.860
for fear of being yanked off the streets,

28:26.860 --> 28:29.260
their friends and family members

28:29.260 --> 28:31.000
who've been killed in this war,

28:33.020 --> 28:37.940
the only way this ends is when both sides come to the table

28:37.940 --> 28:40.180
and find an agreement that neither side

28:40.180 --> 28:42.080
is gonna be completely happy with,

28:42.080 --> 28:45.240
both sides being forced to make some concessions,

28:45.240 --> 28:48.980
but one where they will both walk away

28:48.980 --> 28:50.980
and this war can end.

28:50.980 --> 28:55.500
What's the role of the US president, perhaps,

28:55.500 --> 28:56.860
to bring everybody to the table?

28:56.860 --> 28:59.580
Do you think the US president should sit down

28:59.580 --> 29:01.620
with Zelensky and Putin together?

29:01.620 --> 29:04.900
Yes, yes, in an ideal world, yes.

29:04.900 --> 29:07.240
This should have happened long ago.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.840
The question of whether or not President Biden

29:11.840 --> 29:15.460
is the right person to do that at this time

29:15.460 --> 29:20.460
when all of the statements and comments that they have made,

29:20.500 --> 29:22.480
the Biden-Harris administration has made

29:22.480 --> 29:25.060
from the beginning of this war,

29:25.060 --> 29:28.100
essentially point to their objective being

29:28.100 --> 29:31.420
to basically destroy Russia,

29:31.420 --> 29:34.460
and that's one of the reasons why they have supported

29:34.460 --> 29:37.740
both the continuation of this war for as long as it's lasted

29:37.740 --> 29:41.800
as well as why they have thwarted efforts towards peace.

29:44.020 --> 29:49.020
Whoever that most effective neutral broker is,

29:49.500 --> 29:53.440
that's the best person to do this.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.180
The Biden-Harris administration,

29:55.180 --> 29:57.380
I think the role that they have to take

29:57.380 --> 30:02.380
is actually encouraging Zelensky to sit down

30:03.500 --> 30:05.240
and begin this process.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.300
Those kinds of engagements are the most, to me,

30:08.300 --> 30:12.780
the most powerful exercises of diplomacy

30:12.780 --> 30:16.140
that can't be matched, especially when our president's

30:16.140 --> 30:17.500
foremost role and responsibility

30:17.500 --> 30:19.960
is to serve as commander in chief.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.660
And I wish that we had leaders who were more willing

30:22.660 --> 30:26.100
to engage because I think we'd make a lot more progress

30:26.100 --> 30:31.100
more quickly to find areas both of mutual interest

30:32.060 --> 30:37.060
as well as to help de-conflict and de-escalate areas

30:37.980 --> 30:40.060
where there is tension or disagreement

30:40.060 --> 30:41.620
or adversarial interests.

30:41.620 --> 30:43.780
Well, some of it is basic human camaraderie.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.520
People call me naive for this,

30:47.520 --> 30:50.060
but sometimes just knowing that there's a human

30:50.060 --> 30:53.360
on the other side, even like when it's in private,

30:54.460 --> 30:56.920
if you look at Zelensky and Putin, for example,

30:59.140 --> 31:03.400
just humor, both are very intelligent, witty,

31:04.340 --> 31:07.180
at times even funny people.

31:07.180 --> 31:08.620
Yes, this is wartime.

31:08.620 --> 31:11.820
Yes, a lot of civilians and soldiers are dying.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.480
There's hate.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.380
But if you can look above it all

31:15.380 --> 31:18.120
and think about the future of the countries,

31:18.120 --> 31:20.200
the flourishing of a people,

31:20.200 --> 31:24.460
and the stopping of the death of civilians and soldiers,

31:24.460 --> 31:26.400
then in that place you can have

31:26.400 --> 31:28.320
that basic human connection.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.160
I agree.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.840
I don't think that's naive at all.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.000
And I think there are so many examples through history

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
that point to the power of that, the real power in that.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.840
In the Cuban Missile Crisis,

31:43.840 --> 31:47.600
how JFK had to literally find a secret way

31:47.600 --> 31:49.040
to communicate with Khrushchev

31:49.040 --> 31:53.720
to try to go around the backs of the military commanders

31:53.720 --> 31:55.800
who were urging him to take military action

31:55.800 --> 31:57.960
and instead find, hey,

31:57.960 --> 32:00.200
we both ultimately want the same thing.

32:00.200 --> 32:04.100
Neither of us wants to launch a catastrophic nuclear war,

32:04.100 --> 32:05.640
so let's figure this out.

32:05.640 --> 32:08.680
Of course, there's examples throughout history.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.200
Leaders are complicated people.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.280
They're manipulative people.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.980
So you have Hitler and Chamberlain meeting,

32:14.540 --> 32:19.020
Chamberlain kinda getting hoodwinked by Hitler's charisma

32:19.020 --> 32:21.380
and being convinced that Hitler doesn't have any interest

32:21.380 --> 32:24.860
in invading and destroying the rest of the world.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.580
So you have to-

32:26.580 --> 32:27.420
Smart.

32:28.540 --> 32:29.540
Don't be hoodwinked.

32:31.820 --> 32:35.000
You've met, you've been criticized for this.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.700
You've met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad

32:38.660 --> 32:41.620
and as part of the campaign,

32:41.620 --> 32:42.980
running for president got criticized

32:42.980 --> 32:45.080
for not calling him a war criminal.

32:46.180 --> 32:48.340
What's the right way to meet and communicate

32:48.340 --> 32:50.140
with these kinds of leaders?

32:51.300 --> 32:54.100
As I just stated, we need leaders who have the courage

32:54.100 --> 32:58.500
to meet not just with allies, but with adversaries

32:58.500 --> 33:01.080
in the pursuit of peace,

33:01.080 --> 33:05.380
in the pursuit of increased understanding.

33:05.380 --> 33:10.380
If policies are being made through the lenses

33:10.380 --> 33:15.380
and the barriers of bureaucrats and the media

33:15.460 --> 33:19.600
and others who have or may have their own interests,

33:21.480 --> 33:23.740
our president, a leader can't make,

33:23.740 --> 33:27.020
even members of Congress can't make decisions

33:27.020 --> 33:30.220
with the kind of clarity that we, the American people,

33:30.220 --> 33:32.340
need them to make.

33:32.340 --> 33:37.340
I think that these kinds of engagements are weaponized

33:38.340 --> 33:41.460
and politicized as they were against me

33:43.580 --> 33:47.180
by those who have their own interests,

33:47.180 --> 33:49.300
whether it be the military industrial complex

33:49.300 --> 33:51.940
or in Washington.

33:51.940 --> 33:55.360
If you're not part of the official narrative

33:55.360 --> 33:57.820
of the US government,

33:57.820 --> 34:02.520
which was intent on a regime change war in Syria,

34:02.520 --> 34:05.180
then you're an outcast.

34:05.180 --> 34:09.980
And it was unfortunate

34:09.980 --> 34:14.980
because people levied all kinds of accusations

34:16.380 --> 34:19.060
and smears against me for going

34:19.060 --> 34:23.420
and having the audacity to go and learn more,

34:23.420 --> 34:25.940
try to seek the truth in the hopes

34:25.940 --> 34:29.140
of preventing more needless war

34:29.140 --> 34:32.140
and in the hopes of preventing yet another quagmire

34:32.140 --> 34:36.140
and disastrous war in the Middle East.

34:36.140 --> 34:41.140
And simply for going and yes, meeting with Assad,

34:42.860 --> 34:45.340
also meeting with religious leaders in Syria,

34:45.340 --> 34:47.100
also meeting and talking with people

34:47.100 --> 34:50.660
on the streets of Damascus, talking with college students,

34:50.660 --> 34:53.140
talking with people from the opposition party

34:53.140 --> 34:57.540
who would like to see Assad replaced,

34:58.380 --> 35:00.900
talking with local law,

35:00.900 --> 35:04.220
just a whole host of people over the course of a few days.

35:05.420 --> 35:10.420
The accusation was I'll be like, oh, she loves dictators.

35:10.420 --> 35:12.220
It's a sad state of affairs

35:12.220 --> 35:16.420
when some of the most influential voices in our country

35:16.420 --> 35:21.420
will label someone a lover or supporter of dictators

35:21.580 --> 35:23.380
simply because you're saying,

35:23.380 --> 35:27.020
hey, we shouldn't be going to war.

35:27.020 --> 35:28.900
There is another way.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.500
And I'm not alone in this.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.620
People who were against the war in Iraq

35:34.060 --> 35:39.060
were given similar labels until it became popular

35:39.940 --> 35:42.700
in our politics to have been against the Iraq war.

35:42.700 --> 35:45.420
We see the same thing now with people like Tucker, myself,

35:45.420 --> 35:46.860
and others who are saying,

35:48.180 --> 35:50.460
we should not be waging this proxy war

35:50.460 --> 35:52.420
against Russia via Ukraine

35:52.420 --> 35:55.580
and using the Ukrainian people's lives in this war.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.700
Well, now all of a sudden you're a Putin lover,

35:57.700 --> 36:01.020
a Putin puppet, or whatever, the traitor, treason,

36:01.020 --> 36:04.180
all of these accusations that are used ultimately

36:04.180 --> 36:07.300
by people who are not interested

36:07.300 --> 36:10.900
in having a substantive conversation about the truth,

36:10.900 --> 36:14.780
about looking at these wars and conflicts

36:14.780 --> 36:16.740
with a comprehensive view

36:16.740 --> 36:20.500
on exactly all the dynamics that are at play.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.220
And then that's what I found when I came back.

36:22.220 --> 36:25.380
I went to Syria looking forward

36:26.220 --> 36:27.540
to coming back and shedding light

36:27.540 --> 36:30.060
on different perspectives, experiences,

36:30.060 --> 36:31.980
and stories that I found

36:31.980 --> 36:35.740
that would give people a more broad understanding

36:35.740 --> 36:38.980
of what was happening in that country.

36:38.980 --> 36:43.420
And what I found was there was zero interest

36:43.420 --> 36:47.580
in the mainstream media or in Congress

36:47.580 --> 36:50.860
in hearing any other perspective other than their own,

36:50.860 --> 36:54.780
which was we need to launch this regime change war

36:54.780 --> 36:58.460
through the use of arming and equipping known terrorists

36:58.460 --> 37:02.580
within Syria to overthrow the regime without any idea,

37:03.700 --> 37:07.060
without them stating any realistic idea

37:07.060 --> 37:11.260
of who would take control once Assad was overthrown.

37:11.260 --> 37:12.940
But the reality actually being

37:12.940 --> 37:15.500
that no matter which opposition group

37:15.500 --> 37:17.020
they might try to prop up,

37:17.020 --> 37:19.580
they would not have the power to withstand

37:19.580 --> 37:22.900
the terrorist groups whose stated goal it was

37:22.900 --> 37:26.780
to go and take over power from Assad.

37:26.780 --> 37:31.780
They had no interest in trying to gain true understanding.

37:32.180 --> 37:33.980
And it was very disheartening.

37:33.980 --> 37:35.380
It was very disheartening.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.380
And a big lesson learned

37:37.380 --> 37:40.740
about where their interests really were focused.

37:40.740 --> 37:44.420
Yeah, it's a simplistic narrative template

37:44.420 --> 37:46.740
that's fit into every single situation.

37:47.940 --> 37:49.820
A lot of stuff is not talked about

37:49.820 --> 37:52.140
in the Russia-Ukraine war.

37:52.180 --> 37:54.500
One of the things that's not talked about is,

37:54.500 --> 37:56.540
okay, so Putin is overthrown,

37:56.540 --> 37:58.140
then who do you think will come into power?

37:58.140 --> 37:58.980
Exactly.

37:58.980 --> 38:00.980
One of the things I talk about with Aristowicz

38:00.980 --> 38:05.020
is that Putin, and he gets criticized for this,

38:05.020 --> 38:07.500
that Putin, out of all the people that might take power,

38:07.500 --> 38:11.980
is the most liberal, is the most dovish.

38:11.980 --> 38:14.660
In fact, every indication shows

38:14.660 --> 38:17.100
that he really hates this war.

38:17.940 --> 38:20.700
And so everybody that will step in,

38:20.700 --> 38:24.460
if he steps down or if he is overthrown,

38:24.460 --> 38:28.140
it's just going to accelerate this war

38:28.140 --> 38:31.820
and the expansionism and the thirst for empire

38:31.820 --> 38:32.740
and all that kind of stuff

38:32.740 --> 38:37.740
that the U.S. military industrial complex will feed into.

38:37.980 --> 38:41.020
So you have to think about what the future holds

38:41.020 --> 38:43.660
and what the different power players are

38:43.660 --> 38:46.060
and what the level of corruption there is

38:46.060 --> 38:50.660
and the realistic view of the situation

38:50.660 --> 38:53.100
versus the idealistic view of the situation.

38:53.100 --> 38:54.500
Just on that note, real quick,

38:54.500 --> 38:56.860
I think that was exposed in broad daylight

38:56.860 --> 39:01.700
when it appeared that the former head of the Wagner Group

39:01.700 --> 39:04.220
was about to try to launch a coup

39:04.220 --> 39:06.860
and how that was so celebrated,

39:06.860 --> 39:11.860
even on MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and others

39:12.580 --> 39:16.580
touting that this was somehow going to be a great thing

39:16.580 --> 39:19.220
without looking at who is this guy really,

39:19.220 --> 39:20.900
what has he been doing in different countries

39:20.900 --> 39:23.700
around the world and what would be his

39:25.220 --> 39:29.260
kind of ruling philosophy and how that would differ

39:29.260 --> 39:31.780
or benefit American interests

39:31.780 --> 39:35.540
or the interest of security and peace.

39:35.540 --> 39:38.940
But also the interest of Ukraine and Russian humanity

39:38.940 --> 39:41.020
overall, just the flourishing of nations,

39:41.020 --> 39:42.700
which is great for everybody

39:42.700 --> 39:44.180
in collaborations with nations.

39:44.180 --> 39:45.100
I agree.

39:45.100 --> 39:46.780
Friendly competition.

39:46.780 --> 39:49.260
One of the things I love about the 20th century

39:49.260 --> 39:51.460
is the friendly, sometimes not so friendly,

39:51.460 --> 39:53.060
competition between the Soviet Union

39:53.060 --> 39:56.580
and the United States in space and the space race

39:56.580 --> 39:58.380
that's created some incredible engineering

39:58.380 --> 40:00.660
and scientific breakthroughs and all of this

40:00.660 --> 40:04.220
and also made people dream about reaching out to the stars.

40:04.220 --> 40:07.860
War destroys all of that or damages it,

40:07.860 --> 40:09.220
hopefully just damages it.

40:09.300 --> 40:12.060
Hopefully the phoenix will rise again.

40:13.820 --> 40:16.820
Well, let me ask you about the criticism you've mentioned

40:16.820 --> 40:21.460
of this probably the most common criticism of you

40:21.460 --> 40:23.300
that you love Putin.

40:24.620 --> 40:26.340
So just to linger on it,

40:26.340 --> 40:29.260
what do you think is the foundation of this criticism?

40:29.260 --> 40:31.020
Well, I'll tell you when it began.

40:34.100 --> 40:39.100
My first day in Congress was January 3rd, 2013.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.380
I believe it was the third, fourth, fifth,

40:41.380 --> 40:42.620
somewhere around there.

40:42.620 --> 40:45.780
And my last day was January 3rd, 2021.

40:47.260 --> 40:51.500
I had been given my experience of serving as a soldier

40:51.500 --> 40:56.500
in the Middle East and the motivation

40:57.540 --> 41:00.460
that really drove me to run for Congress in the first place.

41:00.460 --> 41:02.220
I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee

41:02.220 --> 41:04.500
and the Armed Services Committee for almost eight years.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.100
The eight years that I was there

41:07.060 --> 41:11.580
with my drive and motivation to actually be in a position

41:11.580 --> 41:12.940
to challenge the influence

41:12.940 --> 41:14.660
of the military industrial complex,

41:14.660 --> 41:18.340
to try to prevent us from needlessly going to war.

41:19.620 --> 41:23.060
And so the likes of Hillary Clinton

41:23.060 --> 41:26.620
and the cabal of warmongers in Washington,

41:26.620 --> 41:29.740
they weren't fans of mine to say the least.

41:29.740 --> 41:32.340
I can't say it was a total surprise,

41:32.340 --> 41:34.780
but it was disheartening nonetheless

41:34.780 --> 41:38.260
that the very day that I announced my candidacy,

41:38.260 --> 41:39.500
that I was running for president,

41:39.500 --> 41:42.100
which was in February 2019,

41:44.140 --> 41:47.660
the hour that I walked up onto that stage

41:47.660 --> 41:49.340
to announce my candidacy, it was in Hawaii,

41:49.340 --> 41:51.540
and I gave my announcement speech.

41:51.540 --> 41:54.180
NBC News published a hit piece

41:54.180 --> 41:59.100
that planted the seeds of suspicion in voters' minds

41:59.100 --> 42:03.060
that somehow I was a darling of Putin and Russia

42:03.060 --> 42:04.180
and whatever.

42:04.180 --> 42:06.780
It was baseless, all of it baseless.

42:06.780 --> 42:11.780
And that continued like a steady drumbeat

42:11.980 --> 42:14.260
throughout my candidacy,

42:14.260 --> 42:17.780
but that really was escalated when in a podcast

42:17.780 --> 42:19.820
with David Axelrod, Hillary Clinton said,

42:19.820 --> 42:22.860
oh, well, the Russians are grooming her.

42:22.860 --> 42:26.900
And this is not,

42:28.260 --> 42:30.620
I mean, this came from a very influential person.

42:30.620 --> 42:32.060
She was the former secretary of state,

42:32.060 --> 42:34.020
former US senator, former first lady,

42:34.860 --> 42:39.020
someone who wielded and continues to wield a lot of power

42:39.020 --> 42:42.460
in the Democratic Party and amongst voters.

42:42.460 --> 42:46.620
And that took it to a whole new level.

42:46.620 --> 42:48.420
What is the basis for this?

42:48.420 --> 42:49.500
Nothing.

42:49.500 --> 42:53.940
It is a tired yet dependable playbook

42:53.940 --> 42:57.140
that is used not only by people like Hillary Clinton,

42:57.140 --> 43:00.900
but also people like Mitt Romney and others

43:00.900 --> 43:05.140
to try to smear discredit

43:05.140 --> 43:07.980
and destroy the reputations of people

43:07.980 --> 43:12.980
who have the audacity to question their objectives

43:14.860 --> 43:17.580
as they call for one war or another,

43:17.580 --> 43:21.820
or have the audacity to say that this is not

43:21.820 --> 43:25.540
in the best interest of peace or in our country

43:25.540 --> 43:27.220
and our national security.

43:28.220 --> 43:31.900
They keep going back to this playbook as they do today,

43:31.900 --> 43:35.020
because again, they're not willing to debate

43:35.020 --> 43:37.780
the substance of one position versus another,

43:37.780 --> 43:39.540
which is what we should have.

43:39.540 --> 43:41.940
If people feel so strongly that we should be going

43:41.940 --> 43:44.140
and waging this war or that war,

43:44.140 --> 43:46.500
okay, great, go make your case to the American people.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.980
Go stand on the floor of the United States House

43:48.980 --> 43:51.700
and actually have this debate.

43:51.700 --> 43:55.140
Allow those who are saying, no, this is not a good idea

43:55.940 --> 43:59.340
to also stand freely and make that argument.

43:59.340 --> 44:04.220
Instead, they resort to the kind of name calling

44:04.220 --> 44:08.060
that tells voters, hey, you can't trust this person

44:08.060 --> 44:10.140
or anything that they say.

44:12.060 --> 44:13.780
Myself and some of my other colleagues

44:13.780 --> 44:16.420
got the same treatment when we tried to pass legislation

44:16.420 --> 44:19.180
in Congress that would have taken out provisions

44:19.180 --> 44:22.980
from the Patriot Act that are most egregiously violating

44:22.980 --> 44:25.540
our Fourth Amendment rights and civil liberties,

44:25.540 --> 44:27.900
authorities that have allowed our government

44:27.900 --> 44:31.380
to illegally surveil Americans without a warrant.

44:31.380 --> 44:35.900
And as we did so, we're called traitors,

44:35.900 --> 44:39.020
we were called, we had other members of Congress

44:39.020 --> 44:42.260
on the House floor saying that if you pass this legislation,

44:42.260 --> 44:45.820
you will be responsible for another 9-11 style attack

44:45.820 --> 44:46.940
on our soil.

44:48.180 --> 44:52.660
These are all distraction tactics to try to divert

44:52.660 --> 44:56.020
our attention away from what's actually happening

44:56.020 --> 44:59.220
and instead just tell voters, hey, you can't trust

44:59.220 --> 45:00.060
these people.

45:00.060 --> 45:01.220
Obviously, this has happened to Trump,

45:01.220 --> 45:02.420
it's happened to Bobby Kennedy,

45:02.420 --> 45:06.900
it's happened to people like Rand Paul and others.

45:06.900 --> 45:10.220
There's a small group but a growing number,

45:10.220 --> 45:13.100
at least on the Republican side at this point,

45:13.100 --> 45:15.580
people who are actually willing to stand up

45:15.580 --> 45:19.620
and challenge the military industrial complex,

45:19.620 --> 45:22.540
challenge the warmongers in both parties.

45:23.380 --> 45:25.580
People on the left have challenged the warmongers as well

45:25.580 --> 45:29.660
throughout the last few decades.

45:29.660 --> 45:32.060
Less so recently, I agree with you,

45:32.060 --> 45:34.380
but less so recently, and this is one of the reasons

45:34.380 --> 45:35.980
why I left the Democratic Party.

45:36.980 --> 45:38.940
One of the foremost reasons.

45:38.940 --> 45:43.940
I devote an entire chapter to this issue in my book,

45:46.420 --> 45:50.380
For Love of Country, Leave the Democrat Party Behind,

45:50.380 --> 45:53.100
going into the detail of some of the things

45:53.100 --> 45:55.220
that we've talked about, about my own experiences,

45:55.220 --> 45:58.060
about what I have learned along the way,

45:58.060 --> 46:02.860
but also how even in the last year, two years,

46:02.860 --> 46:04.620
certainly under this administration,

46:04.620 --> 46:06.500
people who I worked with in Congress,

46:06.500 --> 46:10.460
who were Democrats, dependable voices for civil liberties,

46:10.460 --> 46:15.460
dependable voices speaking out against the insanity

46:15.460 --> 46:19.580
of people who wanted to wage war for the sake of war,

46:20.380 --> 46:25.220
they're largely silent now.

46:25.220 --> 46:29.580
And unfortunately, within the Democratic Party in Washington,

46:29.580 --> 46:31.900
there is no room for debate,

46:31.900 --> 46:36.180
that if you challenge the Biden administration's position

46:36.180 --> 46:41.180
on foreign policy, you're gonna hear about it.

46:41.380 --> 46:45.460
And what we have seen is that that's exactly what's happened

46:45.460 --> 46:47.820
and people have retracted statements

46:47.820 --> 46:51.180
or just fallen silent or whatever the case may be.

46:51.180 --> 46:55.260
This debate that should be existent within both parties

46:55.260 --> 46:57.260
on the Democrat side, unfortunately,

46:58.620 --> 47:02.020
it just doesn't exist anymore.

47:02.020 --> 47:04.340
There seems to be some kind of mass hysteria

47:04.340 --> 47:06.180
over the war in Ukraine.

47:06.180 --> 47:10.900
It was strange to watch that the nuance aspect

47:10.900 --> 47:14.780
of the discussion was lost very quickly.

47:14.780 --> 47:17.140
It was Putin bad.

47:17.140 --> 47:19.020
It was a war between good and evil.

47:19.020 --> 47:20.140
Right.

47:20.140 --> 47:25.140
And in that, if you bring up any kind of nuance discussion

47:25.700 --> 47:29.340
of like, how do we actually achieve peace in this situation?

47:29.340 --> 47:32.500
You're immediately put on the side of evil.

47:32.500 --> 47:36.020
Yeah, which is pretty sick when you think about it.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.420
I mean, the cynical view is, of course,

47:38.420 --> 47:42.780
it's the military industrial complex machine.

47:42.780 --> 47:45.780
The war profiteers just driving this kind of conversation.

47:45.780 --> 47:46.620
Yeah.

47:47.060 --> 47:50.260
I hope they don't have that much power.

47:50.260 --> 47:52.940
I hope they just have incentives and they push people

47:52.940 --> 47:55.940
and they kind of use people's natural desire

47:55.940 --> 47:57.460
to divide the world into good and evil

47:57.460 --> 47:59.980
and fight for the side of good.

47:59.980 --> 48:04.980
People just have a natural proclivity for that.

48:05.060 --> 48:07.180
And that's a good thing that we wanna fight

48:07.180 --> 48:10.180
for the side of good, but then that gets captured.

48:10.180 --> 48:11.300
And manipulated.

48:11.300 --> 48:12.140
Yeah.

48:12.140 --> 48:13.380
Yes.

48:13.380 --> 48:16.580
I admire your hopefulness.

48:17.580 --> 48:22.580
I am hopeful also because of the goodness in people

48:24.140 --> 48:27.220
and the naturally compassionate nature of people.

48:28.540 --> 48:32.420
However, I will tell you from firsthand experience

48:32.420 --> 48:36.060
that what we talk about is the national security state

48:36.060 --> 48:38.180
and the military industrial complex,

48:39.060 --> 48:42.220
this cabal of warmongers that extends

48:42.220 --> 48:45.300
not only within government, but outside of government.

48:46.860 --> 48:50.260
Extends to many powerful media outlets.

48:51.460 --> 48:56.460
They are incredibly powerful and don't have any qualms

48:56.820 --> 49:01.820
at destroying those who try to get in the way of their power.

49:03.020 --> 49:04.540
And they've got a lot of tools.

49:05.420 --> 49:07.020
They've got a lot of tools to do that,

49:07.020 --> 49:10.660
which I think is why President Eisenhower chose

49:10.660 --> 49:14.180
to include this in his farewell address as a warning,

49:14.180 --> 49:19.180
because the only recourse, the only real power

49:20.180 --> 49:22.820
that has the ability to destroy them

49:22.820 --> 49:25.500
and stand up against them is a free people

49:25.500 --> 49:29.740
living in a free society, exercising the rights

49:29.740 --> 49:32.780
that we have enshrined in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

49:33.660 --> 49:35.260
I just talked to Annie Jacobson,

49:35.260 --> 49:37.140
she wrote a book on nuclear war,

49:37.140 --> 49:39.180
a scenario of how a nuclear war will happen

49:39.180 --> 49:41.500
second by second, minute by minute.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.340
I apologize.

49:42.340 --> 49:46.820
If it happens, how it would happen is terrifying.

49:48.100 --> 49:51.380
It's terrifying how easy it is to start,

49:51.380 --> 49:53.740
that one person can start it first of all,

49:53.740 --> 49:55.940
and then there's no way to stop it.

49:55.940 --> 49:59.420
Even potentially with tactical nuclear weapons,

50:02.060 --> 50:05.940
the machinery of it, how clueless everybody is

50:06.900 --> 50:08.420
combined with the machinery of it,

50:08.420 --> 50:09.940
it's just impossible to stop.

50:09.940 --> 50:12.460
And it's just between the rushing,

50:12.460 --> 50:14.220
the United States especially,

50:15.260 --> 50:17.660
and then all of a sudden you have nuclear winter

50:17.660 --> 50:19.460
and five billion people are dead,

50:20.420 --> 50:24.420
and they die through just essentially torture slowly.

50:26.900 --> 50:28.180
How do we avoid that?

50:28.180 --> 50:30.420
How do we avoid a nuclear war?

50:30.420 --> 50:32.500
That's something that you talk about and think about,

50:32.500 --> 50:37.500
how do we avoid this kind of escalation of a hot war?

50:40.180 --> 50:42.340
I think the most essential thing first of all

50:42.340 --> 50:47.340
is understanding exactly what you have just detailed.

50:49.260 --> 50:54.260
We are in this very strange and absurd time

50:54.660 --> 50:59.020
where we have talking heads and so-called pundits on TV,

50:59.020 --> 51:03.420
we have politicians, we have people who are talking

51:03.420 --> 51:08.420
about a nuclear war as though it is a war that can be won.

51:10.220 --> 51:11.620
Period.

51:11.620 --> 51:16.620
And a war that can be waged somehow without that risk

51:18.420 --> 51:22.260
of escalation to the point of destruction

51:22.260 --> 51:24.060
of human civilization.

51:25.300 --> 51:28.500
And so they talk about this as though

51:28.500 --> 51:30.380
it's just another war.

51:30.380 --> 51:32.660
And especially as they talk about the use

51:32.660 --> 51:33.740
of tactical nuclear weapons.

51:33.740 --> 51:36.900
Oh, well, this is small and we think it'll send a message

51:36.980 --> 51:41.500
without actually escalating to the point where

51:42.780 --> 51:45.980
we're dealing with the kind of destruction

51:45.980 --> 51:48.620
that we witnessed in World War II.

51:50.220 --> 51:55.220
That's a dangerous thing when it becomes normalized as,

51:57.460 --> 51:59.180
well, we've got this new missile that'll go

51:59.180 --> 52:00.940
and it's targeted and it's strategic

52:00.940 --> 52:05.940
and it'll only harm this quote unquote military target.

52:06.260 --> 52:10.340
Ronald Reagan was 100% correct when he said,

52:10.340 --> 52:14.060
a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be waged.

52:14.060 --> 52:16.860
It was true then and it's true now no matter how much

52:16.860 --> 52:19.580
these guys who are producing these weapons

52:19.580 --> 52:22.380
or those who are benefiting from that industry

52:22.380 --> 52:25.980
try to tell us, oh no, it'll never happen.

52:27.620 --> 52:30.940
So to me that's an important first step

52:30.940 --> 52:35.780
to continue to inform and educate and sound the alarms

52:35.820 --> 52:40.180
to people don't buy this crap because it's not true.

52:40.180 --> 52:43.700
And I look forward to listening to your podcast

52:43.700 --> 52:46.500
but the PSA that was put out by New York City's

52:46.500 --> 52:49.220
Emergency Management Office about what to do

52:49.220 --> 52:51.300
in the event of a nuclear attack,

52:51.300 --> 52:55.780
you would find it funny if it wasn't so deeply disturbing.

52:55.780 --> 52:57.860
How they created this public service announcement,

52:57.860 --> 53:00.460
they distributed it everywhere across the city,

53:00.460 --> 53:03.260
on the internet, I think it was on the radio,

53:03.300 --> 53:08.300
where you had a woman who appeared to be an actor

53:08.300 --> 53:13.300
coming in and saying, hey, in the event of when

53:13.940 --> 53:18.620
the big one hits, here's what you should do.

53:18.620 --> 53:21.020
Focus on doing these three things and I'm paraphrasing

53:21.020 --> 53:23.260
but I encourage you to watch it.

53:23.260 --> 53:27.260
I'm paraphrasing but she said, get inside,

53:27.260 --> 53:29.860
stay inside and stay tuned.

53:30.500 --> 53:34.100
That was it.

53:34.100 --> 53:38.340
And get inside, go away from the windows.

53:38.340 --> 53:41.700
Stay inside, don't go outside until you get the all clear.

53:41.700 --> 53:46.260
And stay tuned, follow our account on Instagram and Twitter.

53:46.260 --> 53:51.260
And at the very end of this short PSA,

53:52.380 --> 53:57.380
she said her closing words were, we've got this.

53:58.380 --> 54:03.100
And it was so disturbing in that it was so completely

54:03.100 --> 54:04.420
out of touch with reality.

54:06.140 --> 54:10.460
It creates this kind of false sense of security that,

54:10.460 --> 54:13.420
okay, well, it's kind of like, here's what you do

54:13.420 --> 54:16.340
when a tornado hits or when a big storm hits.

54:16.340 --> 54:19.780
And categorizing the big one, a nuclear attack

54:19.780 --> 54:23.300
within that same kind of preparedness

54:23.300 --> 54:25.220
that you would want people to have in the event

54:25.540 --> 54:28.780
of a natural disaster of some sort.

54:30.260 --> 54:35.260
And it is reflective of the carelessness

54:35.260 --> 54:37.980
with which people in our government,

54:38.940 --> 54:41.100
that careless attitude that people in our government

54:41.100 --> 54:45.260
have towards nuclear war and a nuclear attack,

54:45.260 --> 54:50.260
even as they set us up for failure in pushing us

54:50.700 --> 54:54.220
closer and closer to the brink of a nuclear war occurring,

54:54.220 --> 54:56.700
whether it be an intentional attack,

54:56.700 --> 54:59.420
or as we saw during the last Cold War,

54:59.420 --> 55:03.860
one that could be launched unintentionally.

55:05.860 --> 55:10.860
How many near misses were there during the last Cold War?

55:11.140 --> 55:15.460
I saw this documentary called The Man Who Saved the World.

55:15.460 --> 55:18.540
And it was some like mid-level officer

55:18.540 --> 55:21.140
who happened to be on duty and who didn't do

55:21.140 --> 55:25.860
what he was told in launching the nuclear missiles

55:25.860 --> 55:27.980
because of what they thought was an incoming attack.

55:27.980 --> 55:30.500
And it turned out to be a complete mistake

55:30.500 --> 55:34.300
or misread on the radar, but that's what we're facing.

55:34.300 --> 55:35.900
By the way, there's so many things to say there,

55:35.900 --> 55:39.580
but one of the things that Annie Jacobson details

55:39.580 --> 55:43.260
is just how organized the machinery of all of this is

55:43.260 --> 55:47.580
where the humans involved don't have to think.

55:47.580 --> 55:49.420
They just follow orders.

55:49.420 --> 55:52.660
There's a very clear set of steps you take,

55:52.660 --> 55:55.420
and there's very few places where you can inject

55:55.420 --> 55:56.780
your humanity and be like, wait a minute,

55:56.780 --> 55:58.300
what's the big picture of this?

55:58.300 --> 56:03.300
The only person that can think

56:03.300 --> 56:06.020
is the President of the United States.

56:06.020 --> 56:08.900
The President of the United States gets six minutes

56:08.900 --> 56:10.220
after the warning.

56:10.220 --> 56:14.700
The early warning system says, whether it's false or not,

56:14.700 --> 56:16.780
says that we believe that there's been

56:16.780 --> 56:19.660
a nuclear weapon launched.

56:19.660 --> 56:23.220
You have six minutes before you can make the decision

56:23.220 --> 56:27.820
of launch back, initiate.

56:27.820 --> 56:32.820
And to me, that's what I'm voting based on

56:35.140 --> 56:36.700
in the current situation.

56:36.700 --> 56:38.660
You really have to see that as one

56:38.660 --> 56:43.020
of the most important aspects of the United States President

56:43.020 --> 56:45.780
is who do you trust in those six minutes to sit there?

56:46.820 --> 56:49.900
And I'm not really sure, looking at Biden and Trump.

56:51.060 --> 56:54.340
Boy, I don't know.

56:54.340 --> 56:56.940
But I do know that I would like somebody

56:56.940 --> 56:59.860
who is thinking independently

56:59.860 --> 57:04.180
and not part of the machinery of warmongers.

57:07.420 --> 57:10.060
I don't wanna make it sound cynical or dramatic,

57:10.060 --> 57:12.580
but sometimes in such scary situations,

57:12.580 --> 57:14.580
in such dramatic situations,

57:14.580 --> 57:16.180
you kind of follow the momentum.

57:17.180 --> 57:18.500
When the right thing to do,

57:18.500 --> 57:23.060
the right thing for a leader to do is to step back

57:23.060 --> 57:24.660
and look of all of human history

57:26.020 --> 57:29.300
and ignore all the people in the room

57:29.300 --> 57:32.260
that are like saying stuff,

57:32.260 --> 57:34.660
because most likely what they're going to be saying

57:34.660 --> 57:36.860
is warmongering type of things.

57:36.860 --> 57:40.980
That's one of the things why I also get criticized for.

57:40.980 --> 57:44.740
I still think Zelensky is a hero for staying in Kiev.

57:44.740 --> 57:46.980
Everybody was telling him to flee.

57:46.980 --> 57:50.020
It was all the information was telling,

57:50.020 --> 57:54.300
basically saying the world's second biggest military

57:54.300 --> 57:58.620
is like coming at Kiev.

57:58.620 --> 58:01.820
It's just dumb on all fronts to stay in Kiev.

58:01.820 --> 58:03.420
But that's what a great leader does,

58:03.420 --> 58:05.460
is ignores everybody and stays.

58:06.260 --> 58:07.100
Screw it.

58:08.060 --> 58:10.860
I'm gonna die for my country, I'm gonna die as a leader.

58:10.860 --> 58:12.460
And that's the right thing for a leader to do.

58:12.460 --> 58:16.340
It's sad that, I mean, to me,

58:16.340 --> 58:20.700
that's what we should expect of our leaders is exactly that.

58:20.700 --> 58:25.700
And it's sad that having a leader

58:25.700 --> 58:28.500
in that position fulfill their responsibility

58:28.500 --> 58:32.220
and the oath that they take is seen as a heroic act

58:32.220 --> 58:36.060
when we should, like that's your job.

58:36.060 --> 58:40.380
That's what we elect our leaders to do.

58:40.380 --> 58:43.340
And yet so many have failed.

58:43.340 --> 58:48.340
But to your point, it's not cynical at all to know

58:51.060 --> 58:55.420
that in those rooms, especially in these moments of crisis,

58:55.420 --> 59:00.140
unfortunately, there are the predominant prevailing opinion

59:02.380 --> 59:04.340
of this warmongering establishment

59:04.340 --> 59:06.780
that's not specific to one party

59:06.780 --> 59:10.740
is the knee-jerk reaction, which is to go to war

59:10.740 --> 59:14.540
or to execute an act of war.

59:15.940 --> 59:20.940
And this is one of the biggest costs

59:21.500 --> 59:26.500
of this establishment destroying the reputations

59:26.860 --> 59:29.260
of and smearing and trying to cancel and censor

59:29.260 --> 59:31.220
those who are voices of peace

59:31.220 --> 59:34.500
or just those who take a contrarian position and say,

59:34.500 --> 59:36.860
well, hey, why don't we just pause for a moment

59:36.860 --> 59:38.060
and actually think this through?

59:38.060 --> 59:40.420
Why don't we talk through what happens

59:40.420 --> 59:42.780
if we take this course of action?

59:42.780 --> 59:45.740
What happens if we go down a different path?

59:45.740 --> 59:50.260
Let's actually be thoughtful about what our options are

59:50.260 --> 59:53.020
for A, B, and C, and then make the decision

59:53.020 --> 59:55.060
in a thoughtful manner based on that.

59:55.940 --> 01:00:00.940
Even advocating for that is seen as a kind of heresy

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.420
in the warmongering establishment in Washington.

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:09.420
And the cost of their retaliation against those

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:15.420
who are reasonable voices, who look at the world as it is,

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.500
not some fantasy that they wish existed

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.900
is in those rooms during those critical moments,

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.020
people will, even if they know in their heart or their mind

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.660
that this could end really badly,

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.340
their instinct is to self-censor and not speak up

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:38.220
because they don't want to experience the wrath and ire,

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.620
whether it be coming from four-star generals

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:44.900
or the secretary of state or defense

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.260
or these high-ranking people

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.100
in positions of power and influence.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.620
They don't wanna be the one guy in the room

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:54.700
who's just like, hey guys, let's just take a breath

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.580
and actually think this through.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.900
What will happen, not just in the immediate response

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.900
of this action that you're advocating for,

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.500
what are all of the other people,

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.780
other actors, stakeholders in the world,

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.140
how will they respond?

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.420
And then how will we respond to them?

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:12.660
How will they respond to us?

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:15.340
Actually go through this exercise of,

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:19.140
in the military, this is commonly referred to as,

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.620
what are the second, third, fourth order of effects

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.180
that will occur as a result

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.860
of pursuing a specific course of action?

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.340
It's weird how difficult it is to be that person in the room.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.060
It requires courage, which is sad,

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.140
but it requires courage.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.900
But why does it require, even just to ask,

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.580
okay, we've been in Afghanistan and Iraq

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.460
for this number of years, what's the exit plan?

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.300
Right.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:45.700
Just bring that up every day at a meeting.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.540
Yeah.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.300
Like, what's the exit plan?

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:51.420
It's strange that that gets criticized

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.460
while we're in Iraq and so on,

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.860
but I just remember there was this pressure

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.820
you can't quite criticize or ask dumb questions about,

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.900
wait, why are we going into Iraq again?

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.780
They're not dumb questions.

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:04.980
In retrospect, you're like,

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.340
oh, they're not dumb questions at all,

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:10.260
but actually it required a lot of courage to ask them

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.060
while still working within the institution.

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.140
It's easier if you're like an activist from the outside

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.380
saying no war, this kind of stuff.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:19.860
But within the institution, in the position of power,

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:23.460
to ask the questions like, maybe let's not.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.300
Yeah.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:27.140
It seems really difficult.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.780
The same kind of thing in the war in Ukraine

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.860
and just any kind of military involvement.

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.060
Again, I guess the cynical interpretation is

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.900
that it's the military industrial complex

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:41.780
that permeates just the halls of power.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:42.620
It does.

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.500
And what is behind the military industrial complex?

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.940
And there are different examples of this.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:50.460
You can look at the pharmaceutical industry as well.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.900
There's a huge amount of money and a huge amount of power

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:58.900
that wields tremendous influence over members of Congress.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.540
There are different examples of this

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:07.780
across different sectors of our society.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.900
But I think the military industrial complex over time

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:16.900
has proven itself to be the most powerful and influential.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:23.340
And that's what is behind it is this is why they

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.940
try to destroy anyone who dares to ask

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:30.100
the most obvious questions is because it is about power

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.380
and wielding power.

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.140
Well, the cool thing about United States presidents,

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:39.260
they have the power to say a few to everybody in the room.

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:42.460
I think it just seems like they don't quite take that power.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.340
Like you really, people will say like,

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.900
yeah, the US president doesn't have that much power.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:48.380
I don't know about that.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.940
Just like if you look at the law, especially in military,

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:54.500
when you're talking about war and the military,

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.740
they have a lot of power.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:01.180
So they can fire everybody, they have a lot of power.

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.580
They can stop wars, they can start wars.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.780
They have a lot of power.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:08.500
The position of the presidency certainly does.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:13.500
Unfortunately, we have people too often

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:18.220
who assume the presidency from a position of weakness

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.260
because they're afraid of losing power.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.620
And so they make those calculated decisions

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:29.620
not based on what is right or for the right reasons,

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:35.620
but instead driven by fear of loss of power

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.180
and loss of influence.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:42.180
And that's where, especially given all that we are facing,

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:47.540
we need leaders in the presidency and in Congress

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:52.540
who have courage to be that voice in the room,

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:57.780
to ask about, to remain mindful of

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.500
and rooted in the constitution,

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:05.180
to even as we are seeing this legislation being billed

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:10.180
as the anti-TikTok bill, that's really not about TikTok.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.860
It's about freedom of speech.

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:15.220
Can you actually explain that, Bill?

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.300
Yes.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:19.820
This is another, I guess the bottom line upfront

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:23.300
is this is another piece of legislation

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.020
being expedited through Congress

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.380
with strong bipartisan support

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.180
in the name of national security interests

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.980
that is essentially a power grab

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.620
and an assault on freedom and liberty.

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:45.900
And I'll just say this in, I think probably

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.220
like the top three things

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.980
that they're not actually telling us that's in the bill.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:54.420
Freedom of speech.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.580
It's our ability to be able to express ourselves,

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:00.460
whether it be in person, on a podcast,

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.700
on a social media platform, in a newspaper,

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.740
whatever the platform may be.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:12.060
This legislation gives the executive the power

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:16.660
to decide which platforms are acceptable

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:17.900
for us to be able to use.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.860
TikTok itself, the words TikTok is not actually in the bill,

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.780
but it gives the power to the president to decide

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:30.220
who is a foreign adversary, single-handedly,

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.180
no consultation with or agreement

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.900
from members of Congress or anyone else.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.420
It actually gives the power to a cabinet secretary

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.900
to designate who is a foreign adversary.

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.140
And if a social media platform

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:49.460
has at least 20% ownership in a social media platform,

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.380
that platform may be banned

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:58.260
from doing business in America, essentially.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:03.620
But it's not just a foreign state actor

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:06.140
that could be named as a foreign adversary.

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:09.780
It also includes a line in the legislation that if,

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:13.940
let's say a person has at least 25%

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:18.580
financial interest or ownership in a social media platform,

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:22.660
they're an American citizen who may be working

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.100
or living in some other country,

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.700
or working or living here,

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.180
but doing business with other countries.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:34.780
If the executive branch of our government decides

01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:38.420
that this individual is under the influence of

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:43.420
or controlled by someone that they deem a foreign adversary,

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:48.740
then that platform must not do business in America.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:53.620
And that person, obviously, even an American citizen,

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:59.300
is banned from conducting that business.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.700
They must divest, essentially.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.780
So when you look at,

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.900
and this is where there's been a lot of chatter around this,

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:09.060
when you look at Elon Musk, for example,

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.620
well, you already have people in the Biden administration,

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.980
even President Biden himself,

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.460
implying that Elon Musk's activities

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.620
need to be investigated.

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.940
Well, he is someone with Tesla who does business

01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:22.020
in a lot of countries, including China,

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:25.260
and therefore he must be investigated.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.380
It is not at all a stretch of imagination

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:30.700
to say that X could be the next platform,

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.060
that the executive branch decides,

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:35.420
nope, we've designated this person

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.620
to be a foreign adversary,

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.620
and therefore his business interest cannot be allowed

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:44.580
for this social media platform, cannot be allowed to exist.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:48.260
We've seen this already with people accusing him and X

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.740
of interfering in our elections.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.420
Again, it's ironic that it's coming

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.020
from the Democratic Party,

01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:00.220
that they are claiming that a guy who has said himself

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.460
he's committed to free speech

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.500
and is allowing free speech on his platform

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.660
and is not allowing the federal government

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.020
to manipulate his platform

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:15.020
by deeming which accounts are okay to post their content

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.660
and which accounts are not because of disinformation

01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.820
or whatever they claim it to be.

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:24.220
It's not an accident that the social media platforms

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.940
that have been proven to take action

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.540
at the behest of the federal government

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:32.900
and the White House to censor certain voices,

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:37.940
they're not included with or being targeted at all

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:41.860
in this legislation or outside of it,

01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:46.580
yet other platforms that are not cooperating

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:50.100
or collaborating somehow are.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.100
So the underlying issue here,

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.460
this is being sold as TikTok and national security,

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.500
but ultimately, even as Ron Paul said,

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.740
this is legislation that's the greatest assault on liberty

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.820
since the Patriot Act was passed.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:07.700
It is quite dark that this is just a graph of power.

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.860
It is.

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.860
I mean, this doesn't, it's not just with Elon,

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:15.260
it's probably with Zuck, with Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.220
It puts pressure.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.300
It's not just about banning,

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:25.300
but it puts pressure for them to kind of moderate behavior.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:26.940
Yes.

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.700
Which is a slippery slope.

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:32.940
Of course, it's a beautiful dance of power

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.500
because you don't want tech companies

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.060
to have too much power either,

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.140
or individuals at the top of those tech companies

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.540
have too much power,

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.900
but then do you want that power in the hands of government?

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:45.740
No.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.740
The history of this nation is a fascinatingly effective

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.780
journey towards the balance of power,

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:58.100
and it does seem like this sneaky little thing,

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.340
as much as I hate TikTok, on all fronts.

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.540
My brain rots every time I use TikTok.

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:06.820
I know it's also the national security dangers

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.380
of China and so on, but it's just like TikTok, man.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.260
Just, I don't know, it's so addicting.

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.100
It's so addicting.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.700
So when I first saw this TikTok bill,

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.220
I was like, yes, on all fronts.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.300
But then they got me.

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.780
The Trojan horse got me.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.620
No.

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.140
I mean, they all, and this is the social dilemma

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.940
documentary I think exposed a lot,

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.500
there is so much,

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.620
there's so much that these algorithms do

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:37.300
in these various social media platforms

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.580
that's problematic, to say the least.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:46.460
Data security and privacy is a serious issue.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.340
These are serious things.

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:51.780
And so let's have a conversation about these serious things

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:56.700
and cease these attempts to try,

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.660
to have our government try to tell us

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.820
what we are and aren't allowed to see,

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.940
where we are and aren't allowed to say what we wanna say.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.900
That's really what it comes down to.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.500
Yeah, more and more trust people

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.660
to whenever social media companies do bullshitty things,

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.100
for the people to make documentaries about it,

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.700
to discover it, for great journalists

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:22.180
to do great journalism, and to find the flaws

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:25.660
and the hypocrisy and the call for transparency,

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.500
all those kinds of things.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.460
I don't trust, in most cases,

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.700
government regulation of technology companies

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.900
because they seem to be really out of touch.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.860
One, they want power.

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.540
They're really intimidated by the power

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.620
that the tech companies have.

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:43.540
And two, they don't seem to get at the technology at all.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.180
So they're like hindering innovation

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.820
and they're just greedy for power.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.660
And those are not-

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:49.500
It's a bad combination.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.340
It's a bad combination.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.820
The thing here too, though,

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:58.180
this extends far beyond social media companies.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.500
This is a very specific example,

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.340
but it's one example of many how

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:08.340
those who are greedy for power

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.940
are continuing to try to find ways

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:14.620
to tell us how to live our lives.

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:18.020
They are increasingly trying to tell us,

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:22.140
again, what we're allowed to see and hear,

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.380
whether it be social media companies

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:29.020
or what shows up in a Google search engine, for example.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:33.300
And if they're not finding a willing and compliant

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.340
social media company or big tech company,

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:39.140
then they're looking for ways to reach their hand

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:42.940
into those tech companies and force compliance.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:46.140
But in the age of disinformation,

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.860
misinformation, hate speech,

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:53.860
all of the excuses that are given for government,

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:57.020
either directly or indirectly through big tech

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:00.260
to try to censor certain voices,

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:05.260
it really undermines the truth,

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:10.260
which is the way to defeat bad speech

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.620
is with better speech and more speech,

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.140
whether it's hate speech or things

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.500
that you might be offended by

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.940
or things that you might disagree with.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:23.700
The answer is not to have some entity

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:25.300
with the power of censorship

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.260
and being the quote unquote authority

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.700
to decide what is good speech and acceptable

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.180
and what is bad speech and unacceptable.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.180
It's what you said.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:35.740
Let's encourage this debate

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:39.460
and encourage people who are inspired by like,

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:42.380
no, man, I saw this thing or this thing is happening

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:43.300
and it's pissing me off.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.620
So I'm gonna bring a superior argument.

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.820
I'm gonna show what the right way is.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:53.740
And gosh, this is what our founders envisioned for us

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.860
as a society in this country.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.500
And we would be so much stronger

01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:03.220
with a more engaged people and a more informed people

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:06.500
if we had this and had it supported.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.260
Do you think what are the chances

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.460
that the TikTok ban bill passes?

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.180
The way that it passed through the House of Representatives

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:17.660
with such an overwhelming bipartisan support and so quickly

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.740
and President Biden saying that if it comes across his desk,

01:15:20.740 --> 01:15:21.580
he'll sign it.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.660
I thought it would pass through very quickly.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:30.460
I'm only slightly encouraged by the fact that the Senate

01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.060
at least appears to be saying,

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.820
hey, there are serious free speech concerns

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:35.860
around this bill,

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:38.300
serious civil liberties concerns around this bill.

01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.860
We need to do our due diligence.

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:46.300
I won't say I'm cautiously optimistic

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.260
because I understand how that place works,

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:53.860
but their pause at least gives people the opportunity

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:57.140
to continue to kind of sound the alarm

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.940
and for people to call their senators

01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.580
and express their concerns with this.

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:05.780
They're very real valid concerns.

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.020
Yeah, this is really messed up

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.460
just in case we didn't make it clear.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.780
I think this is a really, really big danger

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:12.740
if this thing passes.

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:15.740
Even if you hate Elon Musk or whatever,

01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:17.700
this is really, really, really dangerous.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:21.340
If the government gets say over the platforms

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.740
on which we communicate with each other,

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.060
it's a huge problem.

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.780
And there's a section in there as well,

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:30.780
just kind of the last piece on this is if you use a VPN

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.380
and you try to use a VPN to access this,

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.380
you could have problems with the law.

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:40.540
And you take that a step further and say,

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:42.220
well, how would they know?

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.140
There's a surveillance aspect to that.

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.100
So once you start peeling back the layers

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.100
of this really toxic onion,

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:57.100
it leads, it really leads seriously to a pretty dark

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:59.740
and dangerous and oppressive place.

01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.820
You were a long time Democrat.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:07.020
You were the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:10.580
until you resigned in 2016 to endorse Bernie.

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.460
I should say I love Bernie.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:16.060
I loved him before he was cool, all right?

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:20.380
Anyway, can you go through what happened in that situation

01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:24.340
and with the Democratic National Committee

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.900
and with Bernie and why you resigned?

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.420
As a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee,

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:35.300
one of the things that the rules of the DNC required

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:39.180
was that officers of the DNC of which we were as,

01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:40.500
I think there were five or six of us

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.060
who were vice chairs at the time,

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:47.420
you have to remain neutral in a Democratic primary.

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:51.500
So you're not as a party supposed to be tipping the scales

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.460
in any direction for any candidate

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.020
during a primary election.

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:03.020
And so I had no plans to get involved for any candidate

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:07.820
or against any candidate during that primary

01:18:07.820 --> 01:18:08.900
in just the hopes of like, all right,

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:13.780
we gotta make sure that this is a fair and balanced primary

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:17.540
so that voters have the best opportunity to vote

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:20.020
for the candidate that they're choosing.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.420
I saw a couple of things pretty quickly.

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:24.940
Number one is that the chair of the DNC at the time

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:27.420
was a woman named Debbie Wasserman Schultz,

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.580
Congresswoman out of Florida.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:34.580
And she made very serious decisions unilaterally

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:40.820
that many times we found out about via tweet

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:45.820
or press release that showed she was tilting the scales

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:50.220
in the favor of Hillary Clinton in that 2016 primary.

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:56.140
The other thing that I saw was how the mainstream media

01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.980
and those who are supposed to be in a position

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:03.140
to be neutral arbiters, to facilitate debates

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.620
and forums and conversations

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:06.340
so that voters can be best informed

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:10.820
in who they wanna vote for were calling Hillary Clinton

01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.140
the most qualified person ever to run for president

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.420
in the history of our country

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:18.740
because of the positions that she had held

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:22.900
as secretary of state, as a US senator, as first lady.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.380
And yet they glossed over those titles

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:29.260
without ever holding her, asking questions even

01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:32.500
or holding her to account for her record,

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:36.380
especially in the area of foreign policy.

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:40.980
The job she was running for was to be commander in chief,

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.980
to be the president of the United States.

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:46.380
That responsibility to serve as commander in chief

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.940
is the foremost responsibility a president has.

01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:53.340
It's essentially the one area

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.180
where the president can unilaterally make decisions

01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:02.780
without education, healthcare, immigration.

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.940
Congress has to actually pass legislation.

01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:06.100
President can come through and say,

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.820
hey, here's the policies that I want,

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.500
here's legislation that I'll propose,

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.180
but those changes can't be made without Congress

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.580
working with Congress to pass them.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:18.540
So she was essentially being let off the hook

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:23.540
for her record as an American, as a soldier, as a veteran.

01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.620
That was a big problem for me.

01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:29.300
And so I made the decision to resign as vice chair

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:33.500
of the DNC so that I could endorse Bernie Sanders

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:37.500
who largely at heart, I believe is a non-interventionist.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.460
He hasn't focused a lot on foreign policy.

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.100
It's not at the heart of what his focus has been

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:50.380
for decades, but he was certainly far more

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:53.820
of a non-interventionist than Hillary Clinton

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:57.940
who has shown through her record to be the queen

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.220
of warmongers in Washington.

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:06.460
I wanted to be in a position where I would have a platform

01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:10.460
to inform voters about her record

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.940
so that they could make that decision for themselves,

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:16.220
so that they could see, hey, in this area, on this issue,

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.660
which is incredibly important, there is a clear contrast

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:22.780
between these two candidates running

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:24.740
in the Democratic primary.

01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.820
And that's what drove my decision to resign

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:30.060
and to endorse Bernie Sanders.

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.220
And that's what I went on to do throughout the rest

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.340
of that primary election.

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:36.860
What do you like most about Bernie?

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:37.700
The positive.

01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:42.500
What I like most about him is he is who he is,

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:46.300
unapologetically so, both in personality,

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:50.980
but also in what he advocates for

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.780
and what he's advocated for for a long time.

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:56.380
So you can agree or disagree with his positions,

01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:00.300
but he is who he is.

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:06.660
Like I said, you were a long time Democrat.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:09.700
You were after president in 2020 as a Democrat.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.420
Now you're an independent and you're an excellent book

01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:17.940
describing your journey ideologically,

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.500
philosophically through that.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.940
Why did you choose to leave the Democratic party?

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:30.340
In the book, I go into a number of the central reasons

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.820
why I made that choice.

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:38.820
But fundamental to them is that the Democratic party

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:44.740
has become a party that is opposed to freedom,

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:49.740
that is opposed to the central and foundational principles

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:53.740
that exist within our founding documents

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:58.740
and that serve as the identity of who we are

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:02.740
as Americans and what this country is supposed to be about.

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:08.980
It has become a party that is controlled

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:11.820
by this elitist cabal of warmongers

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:16.820
who are driving forward this quote unquote woke agenda.

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:24.820
And we see it through their racializing of everything.

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:29.300
We see this through their defund the police mission.

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.860
We see this through their open border policies.

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:38.860
We see this through how in their education policy,

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:43.380
they are failing our kids and how they are pushing

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:47.900
this narrative that ultimately

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.140
is a rejection of objective truth.

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:56.900
The fact that it's a question up for debate

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.260
about whether or not,

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:01.780
well, actually it's not a question up for debate for them.

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:06.780
They are actively pushing for boys who identify as girls

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:12.660
to compete against girls in sports,

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:19.100
changing our language so that the word woman,

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:20.820
the identity of being a woman

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:25.300
is essentially being erased from our society.

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:29.820
And it is the height of hypocrisy

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.940
and frankly an act of hatred towards women

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.660
that they are so intent on doing this.

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.900
And ironic that it's coming from the party

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:41.980
that for so long proclaim themselves

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:44.060
to be the greatest feminists

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:47.740
in the most pro-woman party in the country.

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:50.580
I go into detail around each of these issues

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:55.540
and more in the book,

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:59.860
but you will see as we go through each of these issues,

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:02.500
fundamental and foundational to every one of them

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:06.260
is that sadly the Democratic Party has become a party

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:09.780
that is so consumed by their desire for power,

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.540
this insatiable hunger for power

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.700
that they are willing to destroy,

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.780
they are willing to destroy our republic,

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:20.620
our democracy, our freedom,

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:23.700
just so that they can try to hold on to power

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:25.100
and gain more power.

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.300
So these are just different mechanisms for power.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:30.620
The identity of politics and the warmongering

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:33.540
are related to each other in that they're mechanisms

01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:34.380
to attain more power.

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:35.220
Yes.

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:39.980
You're making it sound like only the Democratic Party

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.500
are full of power hungry people.

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:45.860
So to you, the Republican Party,

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:47.420
I don't know if you've met those folks,

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.260
but some of them.

01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:49.100
Couple of them.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.140
Are also in love with power

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:56.700
and are at times to some degree,

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.820
politicians in general are corrupt,

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:01.780
sometimes within the legal bonds,

01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:04.580
sometimes slightly outside of the legal bonds.

01:26:04.580 --> 01:26:07.700
And so to you, to what degree is sort of

01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:10.220
the Democratic Party is worse than the Republican Party?

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:13.220
I don't want to paint a picture of this kind of

01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.420
beautiful vision of the Republican Party

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.980
that they're somehow not power hungry.

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.220
Yeah, I'm glad you brought this up.

01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:26.220
The book details why after 20 or so years,

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:28.900
as a member of the Democratic Party,

01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:30.500
I decided to leave.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.380
And it goes through my experiences

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:38.740
and things that I have seen and learned along the way.

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:41.700
But I also point out exactly that fact in the book,

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:44.820
but from the very beginning with the prologue is,

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:47.300
we should not be naive to think that this only exists

01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:49.180
within the Democratic Party.

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:51.260
There are very serious problems

01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:54.980
within both of our political parties,

01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:58.020
specifically coming from politicians

01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:02.140
who are driven by this desire for power

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:05.780
and who are so afraid of losing that power

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.940
that they're willing to do

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:09.260
whatever they feel they need to do,

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.820
which centers around taking away our freedom,

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:15.300
because the more free we are to make our own decisions,

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:18.380
even if they may end up being the wrong decisions,

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.220
but to learn from those things

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.620
and know that we've got to live with the consequences,

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:25.260
that the beauty and messiness

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:27.060
of what a free society looks like,

01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:32.060
they're so afraid of us because they see us as the people

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.820
and our freedom as the central threat

01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:37.100
to their ability to remain in power.

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.020
I think the difference that we're seeing today

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:45.620
is that unfortunately, we talked about this a little bit,

01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:48.780
how the Democratic Party has become a party

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:51.820
where you must walk in lockstep

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.620
with the leadership of that party

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:59.620
or risk being faced with your reputation being destroyed

01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:04.180
and smeared and all of these different attacks.

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:08.420
And the reason why they do that is to put people like me

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.380
and Bobby Kennedy and others up as an example of saying,

01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.420
hey, if you step out of line, if you challenge us,

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:15.540
this is what we're gonna do to you.

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.300
The Republican Party has also done that

01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:22.300
and they also have politicians and leaders

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:27.780
who are more interested in feeding the thriving system

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:31.220
in the Washington establishment,

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.820
but we're also seeing that the Republican Party

01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:39.780
also has some voices and I would say increasing voices

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:43.060
of people, and I would put Donald Trump in this category,

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:46.500
who are challenging the quote unquote norms

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.300
of the Republican Party that are represented

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:53.540
by people like Nikki Haley or Mike Pence, for example.

01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:59.900
The Republican Party is not a monolithic entity

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:03.380
and it means different things to different people

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:05.340
and that's where I think the real challenge

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.620
in this next election is less,

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:14.500
it's really less about one political party over another

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.940
and it's more about our opportunity as voters

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:23.180
to select leaders, first of all, to fire those

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:28.180
who are against freedom and who are warmongers

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:33.100
who by their essence are willing to take away our freedom

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:37.420
in the name of national security and vote for people,

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:39.700
nobody's perfect, we shouldn't hold anybody up

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:44.700
on a pedestal, but vote for those who are committed

01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:48.140
to the Constitution and who hold those values

01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:50.340
that represent the interests of the people.

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:55.820
I'm not a fan of this choice, but here we are,

01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:57.140
Biden versus Trump.

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:00.460
So let me ask you a sort of a challenging question

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:03.580
of pros and cons, can you give me pros and cons of each?

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:06.500
What's the biggest strength and biggest limitation

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.540
of, let's say, Biden?

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.980
This is a tough question.

01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:17.540
I've known President Biden for a lot of years.

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:21.820
I knew his son, Bo, who served in the National Guard

01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:23.140
the same time that I did,

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:25.660
I consider Joe Biden a friend,

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:27.740
he is someone over the years that I have talked to

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:31.380
and shared laughs with and spent time with

01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:33.300
in different situations.

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:38.180
The positive characteristics that drew me

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.420
to Joe Biden of the past,

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:46.660
they are not represented in how he has led as president.

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:51.420
I'll let the pundits theorize as to how that is

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:55.420
or why that is, but the truth that I know exists,

01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:59.540
which points to his weakness,

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:04.540
is that instead of listening to his better angels,

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.940
he has instead,

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:14.940
he has instead of listening to his better angels.

01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:19.780
At every turn, if you go back and you,

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:21.860
I look back to his inauguration speech

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:24.100
where he promised to be a president for all Americans

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:28.420
and during his campaign promised to be the uniter in chief,

01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:30.980
to bring a country together that was deeply divided.

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:34.540
That's the Joe Biden that I've known for many years,

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:39.380
a guy who has worked with different people

01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:41.940
with different backgrounds and different political views,

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:46.540
but tried to find at different points in time

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.740
a way to work together.

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:54.060
At every turn, he has done the exact opposite

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:58.020
of what he spoke about during his inauguration speech

01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:02.820
and has left us as the American people today,

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:07.740
more divided, less secure,

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:09.660
both from an economic standpoint,

01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.540
as well as a national security

01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:15.900
or a safety and security standpoint and less free.

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:18.500
As a society and as a people.

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.980
So the biggest criticism would be divide,

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:27.140
he divided us or continued the division that's been there.

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:29.540
Who do you be the greatest uniter?

01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:32.780
Like to me, over the past few decades,

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:35.580
to me Obama, you've been very critical of Obama

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:38.420
on the foreign policy side on many fronts.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:43.420
But to me, that guy did really good.

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.340
Maybe some people say just rhetoric,

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:49.420
but I think rhetoric matters in your president.

01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:53.020
I think he was, out of all the presidents we had,

01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.820
is probably the most effective uniter of the people.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.500
Would that be fair to say?

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:02.500
During his 2008 campaign, yes.

01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:06.380
I think that his message resonated with so many people

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:11.380
across generations and across different views,

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:16.700
different backgrounds to where people cried on the night

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:20.020
that he was elected because they felt so hopeful.

01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:24.140
I talked to people and I know people

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:28.900
who set aside their entire lives to work on his campaign

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:33.780
to be a part of this hope and change mission

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:38.220
that he laid out that would bring us together.

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:43.420
Some of the people that I know personally,

01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:45.140
they gave up their lives during the campaign

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:48.420
and after he won, they went to Washington, DC

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:50.540
because they wanted to be able to do the work

01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:53.860
that he had laid out and continue to be a part

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.340
of this mission that they expected

01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:59.300
would extend beyond the campaign.

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:02.780
And they've expressed to me personally

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:06.140
how heartbroken they were because so quickly

01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:09.980
after he was elected, instead of bringing in

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:13.100
a new generation of fresh leadership

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:16.420
that was not a part of the Washington establishment,

01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:19.180
he instead immediately chose to surround himself

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:22.820
with people who were more of the same old, same old,

01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:27.060
who were essentially part of the problem.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:32.060
And many of his actions after that proved that fear

01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:37.980
and that broken heartedness that they felt to be true.

01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.860
And I'll mention one example related to civil liberties

01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:45.420
that we talked about.

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:49.780
He was someone as a US Senator who gave some pretty

01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:51.820
powerful speeches on the Senate floor

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:54.500
about his concerns with the Patriot Act,

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.740
his concerns with surveillance from the NSA,

01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:01.540
his concerns with a violation of our Fourth Amendment rights

01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.300
and civil liberties.

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:05.780
But when as president, he was confronted

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.740
with leaked information about the surveillance occurring

01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:12.220
under those authorities in his presidency,

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:17.220
he took the side of the national security state

01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:23.140
and did not take action to right the wrongs

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.380
that he correctly pointed out as Senator

01:35:25.380 --> 01:35:28.180
and during his campaign for the presidency,

01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:31.700
which is unfortunate because he really did build

01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:36.700
this unifying momentum throughout his campaign.

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:38.700
What do you think that is?

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.780
Why is it so hard as a president to kind of act

01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:45.860
on the promises of the campaign, but also just,

01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:49.460
I mean, his speech, his basically anti-war speech,

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:51.340
that really resonated to me, the fact that he was

01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:54.580
against the war in Iraq, I believe, early on.

01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:56.740
And that was a huge point of distinction

01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.340
between him and Hillary Clinton,

01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:00.140
probably one of the biggest.

01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:02.660
Well, why is it so hard when you step

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:06.980
into the office of president to sort of act on your ideals?

01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.580
I think it goes back to what we talked about a little bit,

01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:15.140
which is, you know, what are you driven by

01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.700
and what are you afraid of?

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:22.700
And if you are concerned for whether or not

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:27.820
you can get re-elected, who's going to fund

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:32.700
that re-election effort, who's going to fund

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:36.380
the presidential library and your legacy that will follow?

01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:40.180
There have been some documented examples

01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:44.940
around how he promised to crack down on big pharma,

01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:49.300
but when push came to shove, his Department of Justice

01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.220
campaign funding was threatened

01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:54.980
and they chose not to take action,

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:58.940
even when they had a very, very strong case to make.

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:03.940
This was with regard to the opioid crisis in the country.

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:08.260
And, you know, this just goes back to the heart

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:11.540
of why it's so essential that we have leaders

01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:15.140
who have courage and who are focused

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:18.940
on doing what we elect them to do.

01:37:19.740 --> 01:37:24.740
And who are resistant to the love of money and power.

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:26.340
Yes.

01:37:27.300 --> 01:37:28.260
It's hard.

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:33.220
And we are human, we are fallible, we are flawed by nature.

01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:35.620
And I'll go into kind of the next one

01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:39.780
you asked about Trump, the weakness side.

01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:42.740
And the lessons that I hope have been learned from 2016

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:47.740
for him and his team is you have to be in a position

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:52.420
where you are surrounding yourselves

01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:56.580
with other people of courage who aren't just thinking

01:37:56.580 --> 01:38:00.020
about their next political job or their next job,

01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:04.540
getting a cable news contract or looking for fame themselves

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:07.420
or looking at how they can monetize their position

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:10.820
for whatever their next financial interests might be.

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:15.380
But people of courage who know what they're up against

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:20.380
to really seriously clean house across the federal government

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:24.540
and the corruption and rot that is so deeply entrenched

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.900
in order to truly be effective.

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:32.740
And if he is reelected, that is my hope

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:37.820
that he sees, that he's learned from what went wrong in 2016

01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:40.300
that, you know, he went in, you know,

01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:43.220
with a largely non-interventionist,

01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:47.140
more focused on peace agenda.

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:50.020
And yet he surrounded himself with people

01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:54.340
who are at the heart of the warmongers in Washington

01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:58.940
and who directly went against the policies

01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.820
that he advocated for.

01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:05.820
On the strength side, I think it's easy to point out

01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:11.060
because it's also what has caused him to be so attacked

01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:15.740
in ways that we haven't seen before,

01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:20.500
certainly not in my lifetime, by the Democrats,

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.220
by the Biden administration, not only in now,

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:26.940
but, you know, something that started back in 2016

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.620
when he was a candidate.

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:32.700
He's a guy who, you know, by all measures

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.100
has been successful in his own life.

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:39.740
And because of that, he's not coming in with this desire

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:44.660
to please Washington that many other politicians have.

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:48.140
And because he is so willing to challenge

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:52.460
the quote unquote norms, and these are not norms

01:39:52.460 --> 01:39:54.340
that serve the interests of the American people,

01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.700
these are norms that serve the interests

01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:00.380
of the most powerful, he is a direct threat.

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:05.380
And so that attitude and that mindset of not coming in

01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:08.620
with the kind of caution that too many politicians

01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:11.940
come in with of wanting to be the popular one

01:40:11.940 --> 01:40:15.660
at the parties or whatever it is that they want,

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:19.500
that is the strength that he brings.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.580
Yeah, I just had a conversation with Dana White

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:25.460
and he's good friends with Trump and he talks to the fact

01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:30.460
that he seems to be resistant to the attacks.

01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:33.020
And some aspect of that is just the psychology

01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:35.180
of being able to withstand the attacks

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:39.340
that are there in the political game

01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:41.940
and that can break people.

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:44.020
Like you just don't want the headaches.

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:46.100
So to withstand the attacks is tough.

01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:50.860
And something about his psychology allows for that.

01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:52.420
I mean, I guess the question for you also

01:40:52.420 --> 01:40:55.060
in your own psychology, you've been attacked quite a bit.

01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:58.060
We've mentioned some of that sort of misrepresentations

01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:02.100
and how do you deal with that by yourself?

01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:03.420
How do you not become cynical

01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:07.500
or overcompensate the other direction, that kind of stuff?

01:41:08.660 --> 01:41:13.580
It really stems from having a clear sense of purpose.

01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:17.460
I never saw, I've served in state government,

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:20.500
I've served on our city council in Honolulu

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:22.220
and served in Congress.

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:27.980
But at no time have I seen this

01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:30.060
as a quote unquote political career.

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:34.860
I don't have that ladder-climbing ambition

01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:37.820
that a lot of politicians have.

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.420
My sense of purpose is deeply rooted

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:45.420
in my dedication and my desire in my life

01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:52.380
to be pleasing to God and to live a life of service.

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:56.660
And what better way to be pleasing to God

01:41:56.660 --> 01:41:58.620
than to try to do my best

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.660
to work for the wellbeing of God's children.

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:06.300
Being rooted in that has made it so that

01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:09.500
as the attacks are coming from different directions,

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:12.020
even as people who I was friends with,

01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:16.700
former colleagues of mine, others, even family members,

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.980
even as they have turned away

01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:23.300
or become attackers against me themselves

01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:27.220
because of different reasons related to politics,

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:30.380
of course it's a sad thing,

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:33.060
especially when it's someone that you know personally

01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:36.300
and have had a personal friendship or relationship with,

01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:41.300
but I don't live my life trying to please politicians

01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:47.860
or please the people who show up on TV or anyone else.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:53.020
As long as I am doing my best to be pleasing to God,

01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:57.500
that is where I draw my happiness from

01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:00.780
and my fulfillment and contentment and strength.

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:03.220
So you spoken about the value of religious faith

01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.580
in your life, of your Hindu faith

01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:09.180
and seeing the Bhagavad Gita as a spiritual guide.

01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:13.220
So what role does faith and God play in your life?

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:14.340
It's everything.

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:18.940
It is central to who I am, what inspires me,

01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:21.940
what motivates me, where I find strength,

01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:26.740
where I find peace, where I find shelter

01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:28.980
and where I find happiness.

01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:31.020
And this has been a constant

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:38.220
throughout times of challenge, times of darkness,

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:42.420
times of heartbreak, times of happiness

01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:47.420
in always feeling very secure

01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:52.940
in knowing that God's unconditional love is ever present.

01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:56.820
And no matter what else is happening in my life,

01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:59.820
that God is my best friend

01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:04.820
and remaining centered and grounded

01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:09.820
in always remembering that and meditating upon that truth

01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:14.500
is, it's everything to me.

01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:18.780
The interesting thing about the Hindu God

01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:23.380
is how welcoming the religion is of other religions,

01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:26.820
just how accepting it is.

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:30.580
In that way, in many ways,

01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:35.220
it's one of the most beautiful religions on earth.

01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:38.500
So who do you think God is to you?

01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:43.660
Like, in specifically the texts,

01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:50.260
but also you personally, what does he represent?

01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:54.140
So for Hinduism, it's also, God can be many,

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:58.220
there's also like a aspect where there's a,

01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:00.500
it's like a part of all of us.

01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.820
There's like a uniting thing,

01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:04.540
not a singular figure outside of us.

01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:05.940
I think one of the things

01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:09.580
that's most commonly misunderstood about Hinduism

01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:12.100
that people don't know is that Hinduism

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:15.540
is truly a monotheistic religion,

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:18.940
that there is one God and he goes by many names

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:22.980
that describe his different qualities and characteristics.

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:25.140
And as you pointed out,

01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:30.140
Hinduism is uniquely of a non-sectarian

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:33.100
spiritual practice, essentially.

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:37.660
It's not a quote unquote religion that you convert into

01:45:37.660 --> 01:45:41.300
or you leave behind or whatever the case may be.

01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:46.140
Bhagavad Gita, a central scripture and text

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:52.460
that comes from India literally means song of God.

01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:57.020
And the principles that are conveyed

01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:02.020
throughout the Bhagavad Gita are applicable to all of us.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:06.700
They are timeless truths that whether you consider yourself

01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:11.700
Christian or Catholic or Muslim or Jewish or Hindu,

01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:17.780
these truths are eternal and relevant through all time.

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:23.140
So for us as kids growing up,

01:46:25.020 --> 01:46:28.900
we learned from and had bedtime stories

01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.700
that came from both the Bhagavad Gita

01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:32.060
and the New Testament.

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:37.060
My dad was raised Catholic, my mom was raised Episcopalian

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:40.220
and both of them were attracted to the Bhagavad Gita

01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.980
as they were in their own lives searching

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:46.500
for a more personal relationship with God

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:50.020
than they had been able to find elsewhere

01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:52.660
in their own spiritual journeys.

01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:57.660
And that's where the application of Hinduism

01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:01.940
there are teachings in the Bhagavad Gita, for example,

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:04.100
that talk about bhakti yoga.

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:07.300
Bhakti yoga essentially translates into

01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:12.980
dedicating your life, striving to develop

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:15.060
a loving relationship with God.

01:47:15.940 --> 01:47:18.500
Karma yoga, there's a chapter in the Bhagavad Gita

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.940
that speaks about karma yoga.

01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:22.460
Karma is a word that has become a part of the,

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:26.820
both karma and yoga have become very common terms.

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:32.660
But what it really means is trying to dedicate

01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:37.660
your actions in life in a way that have a positive impact

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:40.180
on others, being of service to others.

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:44.700
And so for me growing up, I never really understood

01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:47.220
as a kid the idea of sectarianism,

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:49.980
of one religion battling against another,

01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:52.660
because I knew and understood and experienced

01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:58.180
that the real meaning of religion was love for God.

01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:04.340
No matter what name you worship Him by or how you worship,

01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:07.100
that is the real meaning of religion.

01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:10.580
And the application of that in your life is,

01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:16.700
you asked how do I see God in a personal way?

01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:20.540
I see, I know that God is my best friend.

01:48:20.540 --> 01:48:22.420
God is my confidant.

01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:26.300
When I am struggling with a problem in my life,

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:30.500
or during those quiet moments by myself

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:35.060
where I am anxious or I'm sad,

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:41.260
I turn to God for that solace,

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:45.100
for that clarity, for that strength

01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:48.260
to both know what the right thing to do is

01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:51.900
and the strength to act accordingly

01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:57.540
and to constantly strive to further develop

01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:00.380
that very personal loving relationship with God.

01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.620
Tulsi, this is an honor to finally meet you,

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:04.460
to talk to you.

01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:05.860
This was amazing, thank you.

01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:06.700
Thank you, Lex.

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:07.660
It's so wonderful to be here.

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.860
Thank you for the opportunity.

01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.420
Thanks for listening to this conversation

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:12.620
with Tulsi Gabbard.

01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:13.700
To support this podcast,

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:16.420
please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:18.660
And now, let me leave you with some words

01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:23.100
from Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1961 farewell address.

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:27.180
A vital element in keeping the peace

01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.460
is our military establishment.

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:33.500
Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.380
so that no potential aggressor

01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:37.580
may be tempted to risk his own destruction.

01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:41.540
American makers of plowshares could,

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:45.300
with time and as required, make swords as well.

01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:48.260
But now, we can no longer risk emergency improvisation

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.220
of national defense.

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:53.540
We have been compelled to create a permanent

01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:56.540
armaments industry of vast proportions.

01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:00.420
This conjunction of immense military establishment

01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:04.820
and a large arms industry is new in the American experience.

01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:09.820
Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.

01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:11.980
In the councils of government,

01:50:11.980 --> 01:50:14.060
we must guard against the acquisition

01:50:14.060 --> 01:50:18.460
of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought

01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:21.820
by the military industrial complex.

01:50:21.820 --> 01:50:24.500
The potential for the disastrous rise

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:28.620
of misplaced power exists and will persist.

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:32.940
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
