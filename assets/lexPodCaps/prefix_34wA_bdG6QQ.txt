00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
Regardless of whatever was written in these books

00:02.840 --> 00:05.040
that were written thousands and thousands of years ago,

00:05.040 --> 00:08.040
the fact of the matter is no one has a right

00:08.040 --> 00:09.920
to go on slaughtering people,

00:09.920 --> 00:11.320
removing them from their homes

00:11.320 --> 00:13.560
and then continuing to live in their homes,

00:13.560 --> 00:15.920
continuing to drink coffee on their balconies

00:17.040 --> 00:19.840
decades and decades later with no shame,

00:19.840 --> 00:23.320
with no introspection, with no reflection.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.000
No one has the right to do that.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.280
No one has the right to keep an entire population

00:27.280 --> 00:29.280
of people in a cage.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.120
Which is what's happening to people in the West Bank

00:33.120 --> 00:36.000
who have no freedom of movement,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.800
which is what's happening in Gaza,

00:38.800 --> 00:42.360
which is blockaded to water, air and land

00:42.360 --> 00:46.400
and is deemed uninhabitable

00:46.400 --> 00:49.080
by human rights organizations like the UN.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.640
No one has a right to do that.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.760
The following is a conversation with Mohammed El-Kurd,

00:55.760 --> 00:59.280
a world-renowned Palestinian poet, writer, journalist

00:59.320 --> 01:02.320
and an influential voice speaking out

01:02.320 --> 01:04.880
and fighting for the Palestinian cause.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.960
He provides a very different perspective

01:06.960 --> 01:10.480
on Israel and Palestine than my previous two episodes

01:10.480 --> 01:14.600
with Benjamin Netanyahu and Yuval Noah Harari.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.960
I hope his story and his words

01:16.960 --> 01:19.320
add to your understanding of this part of the world

01:19.320 --> 01:21.120
as it did to mine.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.080
I will continue to have difficult long form conversations

01:24.080 --> 01:28.680
such as these, always with empathy and humility,

01:28.680 --> 01:30.880
but with backbone.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.240
And please allow me to briefly comment about criticisms

01:34.240 --> 01:38.720
I receive of who I am as an interviewer and a human being.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.080
I am not afraid to travel anywhere

01:42.080 --> 01:45.360
or challenge anyone face to face,

01:45.360 --> 01:47.960
even if it puts my life in danger.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.840
But I'm also not afraid to be vulnerable,

01:50.840 --> 01:53.440
to truly listen, to empathize,

01:53.440 --> 01:55.320
to walk a mile in the well-worn shoes

01:55.320 --> 01:58.120
of those very different from me.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.880
It's this latter task, not the formal one,

02:00.880 --> 02:02.920
that is truly the most challenging

02:02.920 --> 02:06.120
in conversations and in life.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.120
But to me, it is the only way.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.320
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.120
To support it, please check out our sponsors

02:13.120 --> 02:14.320
in the description.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.880
And now, dear friends, here's Mohammed El-Kurd.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.480
Tell me about Sheikh Jarrah,

02:20.480 --> 02:23.280
the neighborhood in East Jerusalem where you grew up.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.560
Sheikh Jarrah is, you know, in a way,

02:25.560 --> 02:26.680
a typical neighborhood,

02:26.680 --> 02:30.640
despite the absurd reality that surrounds it.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.280
It's a typical neighborhood

02:32.280 --> 02:34.280
in terms of Palestinian neighborhoods.

02:34.280 --> 02:37.480
It's one that is threatened with colonialism,

02:37.480 --> 02:40.000
with settler expansion, and with forced expulsion.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.120
And it has been that way since the early 70s.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.200
My family, like all of the other families in Sheikh Jarrah,

02:48.200 --> 02:51.240
were expelled from their homes in the Nakba in 1948.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.480
And they were forced out by the Haganah

02:53.480 --> 02:56.040
and other Zionist parallel militaries

02:56.040 --> 02:58.800
that later formed the Israeli military.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.440
And they were driven to various cities.

03:01.440 --> 03:05.120
And my grandmother moved from city to city,

03:05.120 --> 03:07.960
and she ended up in Sheikh Jarrah in 1956.

03:07.960 --> 03:12.160
Sheikh Jarrah was established as a refugee housing unit

03:13.440 --> 03:16.200
by the United Nations and by the Jordanian government,

03:16.200 --> 03:20.520
which had control over that part of Jerusalem at the time.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.480
And then people lived there harmoniously.

03:25.480 --> 03:28.480
They were all from different parts of Palestine.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.080
And, you know, they managed to rebuild their lives

03:31.080 --> 03:32.320
after the first expulsion.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.120
And then in the 70s, you had settler organizations,

03:36.120 --> 03:38.360
many of whom were registered here in New York

03:38.360 --> 03:40.040
and in the United States,

03:40.040 --> 03:42.840
claiming our houses and our lands as their own

03:42.840 --> 03:44.440
by divine decree.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.880
And because, obviously, because the judges are Israeli

03:47.880 --> 03:50.160
and the laws were written by Israeli settlers

03:50.800 --> 03:53.880
and the whole judiciary was established

03:53.880 --> 03:57.600
atop the rubble of our homes and villages,

03:57.600 --> 04:02.480
we had no, you know, we had no real pull in the courts.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.360
The Israeli courts would look at the Israeli documents,

04:05.360 --> 04:08.640
which we argue are falsified and fabricated,

04:08.640 --> 04:10.480
and they would take them at face value

04:10.480 --> 04:11.560
without authentication.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.440
And they refused to look at our documents.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.800
They refused to look at the documents

04:14.800 --> 04:16.880
from the Jordanian government, the documents from the UN,

04:16.880 --> 04:19.720
the documents from the Ottoman archives.

04:19.720 --> 04:23.200
So you already have this kind of asymmetry in the court

04:23.200 --> 04:25.560
that for any person with common sense would lead you

04:25.560 --> 04:29.800
to believe that this is not, in fact, a legal battle

04:29.800 --> 04:31.400
or a real estate dispute

04:31.400 --> 04:33.600
as the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs

04:33.600 --> 04:34.680
likes to frame it,

04:34.680 --> 04:37.200
but rather a very, very political battle,

04:37.200 --> 04:40.120
one that is about social engineering,

04:40.120 --> 04:42.040
one is about demographics,

04:42.040 --> 04:47.040
one that is about removing as many Palestinians as possible

04:47.600 --> 04:49.080
from occupied Jerusalem.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.600
So we did what all Palestinian families in Jerusalem do

04:53.600 --> 04:54.960
when they're faced with this kind of threat,

04:54.960 --> 04:56.240
and we bought time.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.040
We pleaded and pleaded and appealed the courts

05:00.040 --> 05:01.040
and appealed the cases,

05:01.040 --> 05:04.360
and we got over 50 expulsion orders.

05:05.520 --> 05:10.520
In 2009, rifle-wielding settlers accompanied by police

05:11.240 --> 05:12.880
and Israeli military came over

05:14.080 --> 05:16.680
and shoved our neighbors outside of their home

05:17.320 --> 05:19.320
and they threw them out in the middle of the night

05:19.320 --> 05:21.360
with sound bombs and rubber bullets,

05:21.360 --> 05:26.000
and they had to live in tents on the street

05:26.000 --> 05:27.520
for many, many months,

05:27.520 --> 05:30.200
and even lived in our front yards for a few months

05:30.200 --> 05:31.760
and lived in their cars.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.000
Can you link on that process?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.160
2009, you said 50 expulsion orders.

05:36.160 --> 05:40.120
What was the most brutal thing you've ever seen in your life?

05:40.120 --> 05:42.160
I mean, I think it was the most brutal thing

05:42.160 --> 05:43.800
that I've ever seen in my life.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.200
You said 50 expulsion orders.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.720
What was happening?

05:48.720 --> 05:50.640
Between the 70s and 2009,

05:50.640 --> 05:53.800
there had been many dozens of expulsions orders against us

05:53.800 --> 05:56.720
and against many other families in the neighborhood,

05:56.720 --> 05:59.640
28 families in total, actually.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.880
And in 2008, 2009,

06:02.880 --> 06:05.640
the first wave of expulsions finally happened.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.360
It actually began with Amkam el-Qurd.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.200
We're not related,

06:10.200 --> 06:12.760
but we live on the same street in the same neighborhood.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.040
She was thrown out of her home.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.760
Her husband, an elderly man,

06:16.760 --> 06:17.840
also named Muhammad el-Qurd,

06:17.840 --> 06:19.840
was pronounced dead on the spot.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.840
He had a stroke and died.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.440
The Israeli soldiers pulled him out of his home

06:23.440 --> 06:25.280
while he was urinating

06:25.280 --> 06:28.040
and threw him into the streets, and he died.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.360
A few months later, the Ghawi and the Hanoon families,

06:31.360 --> 06:33.680
which are kind of not a clan,

06:33.680 --> 06:35.920
but in Palestine, you have sometimes a building

06:35.920 --> 06:38.400
that contains multiple brothers and their wives.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.520
Each have little apartments.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.360
So the Ghawi and Hanoon families,

06:42.360 --> 06:45.160
about 35 people were thrown out in the middle of the street

06:45.160 --> 06:46.280
right across from us.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.080
And then by the end of 2009,

06:50.080 --> 06:51.200
I had come home from school

06:51.200 --> 06:53.160
to find all of my furniture scattered

06:53.160 --> 06:54.360
across the length of the street,

06:54.360 --> 06:55.480
and I saw the settlers,

06:55.480 --> 06:58.160
many of whom had American accents,

06:58.160 --> 07:00.240
living in our house.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.800
And their justification for this,

07:03.800 --> 07:06.240
their reasoning for this is divine decree.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.480
This is what God wants.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.000
This is the promised land.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.760
This is so-and-so as if God

07:11.760 --> 07:13.480
is some kind of real estate agent.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.280
So they took over half of our home,

07:17.280 --> 07:21.120
and we continued to be in courts for the following decade.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.640
This was, I was still a child and I had broken English,

07:24.640 --> 07:26.120
and I was talking to all of these diplomats

07:26.120 --> 07:28.080
and all of these journalists

07:28.080 --> 07:33.080
who would subject me to their racism and biases

07:35.440 --> 07:37.160
and so on and so forth.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.120
And I had to prove my humanity time and time again,

07:40.120 --> 07:44.560
and I had to do all of this all with broken English.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.520
And we were lucky even if we got a quote

07:48.520 --> 07:51.120
in the article written about us by the Times

07:51.120 --> 07:53.760
or so on and so forth.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.000
Move forward to 2020, I was in New York City

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
studying a master's degree, getting a master's degree,

07:59.000 --> 08:03.280
and my father calls me and he tells me,

08:03.280 --> 08:06.320
we have yet another expulsion order.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.360
And we decided to launch a campaign.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.080
It was quite ambitious at the time,

08:12.400 --> 08:14.280
but the whole objective of the campaign

08:14.280 --> 08:17.760
was to demystify what is happening, right?

08:17.760 --> 08:19.960
Because it's reported on in the news,

08:19.960 --> 08:22.720
it's reported on around the world

08:22.720 --> 08:24.760
as this real estate dispute as these evictions,

08:24.760 --> 08:26.240
which was not really what's happening.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.760
Evictions do not entail a foreign army

08:29.760 --> 08:31.360
in an occupied territory,

08:31.360 --> 08:33.320
forcibly removing you out of your home.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.960
So I came home from New York and we launched a campaign,

08:37.960 --> 08:40.080
which turned into a global success.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.560
And I believe it was a global success

08:42.560 --> 08:46.200
because finally the images on the screen

08:46.200 --> 08:49.040
matched the rhetoric that was being said.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.280
It wasn't so confusing or complicated anymore.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.400
All of this asymmetry was pronounced and articulated

08:55.400 --> 08:58.560
in a way that any viewer, be it in Alabama,

08:58.560 --> 09:00.440
be it in New York, be it in Egypt,

09:00.440 --> 09:02.920
was able to understand the asymmetry

09:03.840 --> 09:08.280
of the judicial system and the agenda of colonialism

09:08.280 --> 09:10.360
that was taking place here.

09:10.360 --> 09:14.480
And due to immense international and diplomatic pressure

09:15.480 --> 09:18.760
from all over the world, even the United States,

09:18.760 --> 09:22.000
the Israeli Supreme Court was forced

09:22.000 --> 09:24.720
to cancel all of the eviction orders

09:24.720 --> 09:27.560
in Sheikh Jarrah until further notice.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.560
This I consider was a small victory

09:29.560 --> 09:33.000
because obviously we are still at risk of losing our homes

09:33.000 --> 09:35.360
once they decide to do the land registry,

09:35.360 --> 09:38.120
which we can get into a little bit later if you'd like.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.040
But nonetheless, it was something

09:41.040 --> 09:43.320
that we haven't seen before.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.800
And the fact that the Supreme Court canceled

09:46.800 --> 09:49.840
all of these dozens and dozens of past eviction orders,

09:49.840 --> 09:51.960
it set a precedent and it also proved

09:51.960 --> 09:54.640
that this was a political battle, not a legal one.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.240
So let's just add a little more detail

09:57.240 --> 09:59.920
to the people who are not familiar with the story,

09:59.920 --> 10:04.920
with the region, with the evictions, with the courts.

10:05.920 --> 10:09.200
So first of all, Sheikh Jarrah is in East Jerusalem.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.800
Maybe you can say, what is Jerusalem?

10:11.800 --> 10:13.720
Where is it located?

10:13.720 --> 10:16.680
What are we talking about in terms of regionally?

10:16.680 --> 10:20.200
And second, what kind of people live there?

10:20.200 --> 10:23.120
So if you could talk about the Palestinian people.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.520
And we should also make clear that these evictions

10:27.520 --> 10:30.440
is literally people living in homes

10:30.440 --> 10:32.480
and their homes are taken away from them.

10:33.840 --> 10:38.040
I suppose technically it's legal evictions,

10:40.120 --> 10:44.040
but you're saying that there's asymmetry of power

10:44.040 --> 10:48.920
in the courts where the legal is not so much legal,

10:48.920 --> 10:52.640
but is politically and maybe even religiously based.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.440
Yeah, I mean, the most important context here

10:56.440 --> 10:58.880
is that oftentimes Americans think that Israel

10:58.880 --> 11:02.360
and Palestine are some kind of two neighboring countries

11:03.880 --> 11:06.080
that live next to each other and they are at war,

11:06.080 --> 11:10.240
but the fact of the matter is Palestinian cities exist

11:11.440 --> 11:13.880
all over the country and it's just one country,

11:13.880 --> 11:15.400
it's just one infrastructure

11:15.400 --> 11:17.640
and Israel is literally on top of Palestine.

11:17.640 --> 11:22.280
It was established on top of our villages in the late 40s.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.320
Now, according to international law,

11:25.320 --> 11:28.880
the eastern part of Jerusalem is under occupation.

11:28.880 --> 11:33.880
So Israeli presence and jurisdiction over the area

11:34.640 --> 11:36.280
is completely illegitimate.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.160
They say the evictions are legal

11:38.160 --> 11:41.520
because the settlers write their laws.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.200
So obviously they're gonna allow settlements to expand,

11:44.200 --> 11:45.800
but according to international law,

11:45.800 --> 11:48.240
according to even US policy,

11:48.480 --> 11:53.480
Israel occupies the eastern part of Jerusalem.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.080
Its jurisdiction there is illegitimate.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.480
We shouldn't even be going to their courts

11:58.480 --> 12:01.520
in the first place, but we have no other option.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.680
We're talking about Sheikh Jarrah or we're talking

12:04.680 --> 12:06.240
about Jerusalem, we're talking about generations

12:06.240 --> 12:08.000
and generations and generations of people

12:08.000 --> 12:11.400
who have lived there for the longest time,

12:11.400 --> 12:14.200
who now, even though, for example, me,

12:14.200 --> 12:16.600
I don't have a citizenship, I'm a resident,

12:16.720 --> 12:17.960
I'm a resident.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.160
I have a blue ID card, even though my grandmother

12:21.160 --> 12:23.040
and my grandfather were born in Jerusalem,

12:23.040 --> 12:25.200
their grandparents were born in Jerusalem.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.720
Even though we've lived there for generations,

12:28.720 --> 12:31.400
but Palestinians in Jerusalem, we are not citizens,

12:31.400 --> 12:32.960
we're just mere residents.

12:32.960 --> 12:37.320
Same thing with residents of the occupied Syrian Golan.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.040
They are not citizens, they are just residents

12:40.040 --> 12:42.640
in their own hometowns.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.120
This is an important piece,

12:45.120 --> 12:48.680
but all of this gets convoluted and lost in translation,

12:48.680 --> 12:53.240
and I think I would argue it's a lot more,

12:53.240 --> 12:57.240
it's a lot of the time it's dubious, it's malicious,

12:57.240 --> 12:59.360
the fact that these little pieces of context

12:59.360 --> 13:03.320
that frame the entire story get lost.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.520
You know, I'll talk to you about something else.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.680
Just 10 minutes across from my neighborhood,

13:08.680 --> 13:11.440
Sheikh Jarrah, there's another neighborhood called Silwan,

13:11.440 --> 13:13.520
and the people in Silwan are also threatened

13:13.520 --> 13:15.680
with expulsion, but not through evictions,

13:15.680 --> 13:17.760
but through home demolitions.

13:17.760 --> 13:22.160
And if you look at American media or Israeli state media,

13:22.160 --> 13:23.560
you would read the headlines, you know,

13:23.560 --> 13:27.560
Palestinians living in homes built illegally

13:27.560 --> 13:29.160
are gonna face, you know,

13:29.160 --> 13:31.440
their homes are gonna be torn apart.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.200
What these headlines don't tell you,

13:33.200 --> 13:34.960
and even sometimes, most of the time,

13:34.960 --> 13:37.080
the substance doesn't tell you,

13:37.080 --> 13:39.440
that Palestinians seldom ever get

13:40.440 --> 13:43.040
building permit applications.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.000
In fact, recently a spokesperson

13:45.000 --> 13:46.120
for the Israeli military confirmed

13:46.120 --> 13:48.680
that it was 95% of building permits applications

13:48.680 --> 13:50.320
submitted by Palestinians in East Jerusalem

13:50.320 --> 13:53.720
and the West Bank are rejected by the Israeli authorities.

13:53.720 --> 13:57.360
And to make this even more absurd,

13:57.360 --> 14:00.880
the guy, the councilman who is responsible

14:01.960 --> 14:06.400
for rejecting and accepting building permit applications,

14:06.400 --> 14:07.960
his name is Yonatan Youssef,

14:07.960 --> 14:11.760
and he's an activist in the settler movements,

14:11.760 --> 14:13.560
and he's a Jerusalem council member.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.960
And he, last week, following the expulsion

14:17.960 --> 14:22.160
of a subalaban family in the old city of Jerusalem,

14:22.160 --> 14:26.520
he posted to his official Facebook account, Nakba Now,

14:26.520 --> 14:29.080
demanding a second Nakba, promising another Nakba.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.840
He has done so on many occasions.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.440
He has chanted with a megaphone just a few months ago,

14:33.440 --> 14:35.880
walking down the street in my neighborhood,

14:35.880 --> 14:37.400
chanting, we want Nakba Now.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.680
This is a man who has vandalized our murals,

14:39.960 --> 14:43.080
who has screamed Islamophobic slurs.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.240
This is literally a man in the government

14:45.240 --> 14:47.280
making these decisions, right?

14:48.280 --> 14:52.360
And this is similar to, you know, Masaf Riyatta

14:52.360 --> 14:53.440
in the South Hebron Hills.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.280
For those who don't know,

14:54.280 --> 14:58.320
it's a place in the occupied West Bank

14:58.320 --> 15:01.800
where Bedouin and cave dweller Palestinians

15:01.800 --> 15:03.040
have lived for generations.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.560
They have cultivated the land.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.080
And recently, they were expelled from their homes.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.360
Over 1,000 people were expelled

15:09.360 --> 15:11.840
from their remote small villages.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.480
Again, if you're reading American media,

15:13.480 --> 15:18.480
they would say Palestinians living in firing zones

15:18.600 --> 15:21.880
were removed because they were living in a military zone.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.200
What these media reports will not tell you

15:24.200 --> 15:27.840
that in the 80s, the Israeli government

15:27.840 --> 15:30.080
purposefully classified many lands

15:30.080 --> 15:33.120
in the occupied West Bank as firing zones,

15:33.120 --> 15:36.400
as off-limit military zones for the sole purpose

15:36.480 --> 15:38.200
of expelling the residents.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.240
And this is not some kind of conspiracy theory.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.320
This is declassified information

15:42.320 --> 15:43.840
that was released from the Israeli State Archive

15:43.840 --> 15:46.080
that was later reported on by audits.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.080
Also, these reports will not tell you

15:48.080 --> 15:52.320
that the judge who rules on whether these people

15:52.320 --> 15:53.960
continue to live under homes or not

15:53.960 --> 15:56.720
is himself a settler in the West Bank.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.080
And I'm not even talking about, you know,

15:59.080 --> 16:00.200
a loose definition of a settler,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.160
but according to international law,

16:02.160 --> 16:04.640
this is a settler living illegally

16:04.680 --> 16:07.680
in an illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.760
This is the judiciary that we deal with,

16:10.760 --> 16:14.920
which is hilarious considering how it's being reported on

16:14.920 --> 16:17.240
in American media recently as some kind of beacon

16:17.240 --> 16:18.480
of progress and democracy

16:18.480 --> 16:20.760
that the new government is trying to undermine.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.600
So there's no representation in the courts

16:22.600 --> 16:23.840
for the Palestinian people.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.240
I mean, we have lawyers, but no, there's no,

16:26.240 --> 16:28.120
in fact, there is, for Palestinians

16:28.120 --> 16:30.320
with Israeli citizenships, for example,

16:30.320 --> 16:33.280
there's over 60 laws that specifically

16:33.280 --> 16:35.280
explicitly discriminates against them.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.040
So again, it's technically legal,

16:40.040 --> 16:42.960
the evictions and the demolitions.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.480
Yeah, so was Jim Crow was legal also, you know.

16:46.480 --> 16:50.880
When something is legal, it can also still be wrong.

16:50.880 --> 16:51.920
Absolutely.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.920
History has shown us time and time again

16:55.520 --> 16:59.240
that legality does not necessarily mean morality

16:59.240 --> 17:02.600
and the law, you know, is a,

17:02.600 --> 17:05.280
the law is a bloodbath in many ways.

17:05.280 --> 17:10.000
It has been used and abused to facilitate

17:10.000 --> 17:12.880
the most horrendous atrocities.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.760
And in the case of the Palestinians,

17:14.760 --> 17:17.760
the law has served to facilitate

17:17.760 --> 17:21.160
and bureaucratize our ethnic cleansing.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.360
Do you think there's people, judges,

17:24.360 --> 17:26.600
and just people in power in the judiciary

17:26.600 --> 17:29.720
that have hate for the Palestinian people?

17:30.880 --> 17:32.640
I mean, I'm not really, Yanni,

17:32.640 --> 17:35.160
the easy, simplistic answer is yes,

17:35.160 --> 17:38.720
but I don't really care about the contents of their hearts,

17:38.720 --> 17:40.800
what I care about the policy they enact, right?

17:40.800 --> 17:44.800
The laws they write and enact are hateful.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.480
Demolishing a person's home,

17:47.600 --> 17:51.080
so you can have somebody from Long Island, New York,

17:51.080 --> 17:54.640
who's fleeing, you know, fraud charges.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.400
This is the case in my house,

17:57.400 --> 18:01.440
live in their front yard, that's hateful.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.320
So I don't need, you know, confirmation.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.160
This is something we see a lot, actually, you know,

18:06.160 --> 18:08.600
Palestinians and people who are pro-Palestine

18:08.600 --> 18:11.400
and just people who wanna make a difference

18:11.400 --> 18:14.160
in how this cause is represented.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.880
We often run for the first opportunity

18:19.880 --> 18:21.600
to cite an Israeli being hateful.

18:22.480 --> 18:26.440
The last Israeli prime minister said

18:26.440 --> 18:27.960
that he has killed many Arabs

18:27.960 --> 18:29.680
and that he has no qualms with it.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.720
Netanyahu has said a slew of racist, hateful things.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.200
Jawotinsky, the pioneer of Zionism,

18:37.200 --> 18:39.520
Herzl, one of the pioneers of Zionism,

18:39.520 --> 18:43.720
all have said horrible, hateful things.

18:43.720 --> 18:48.720
We also cannot wait to cite a confession

18:49.840 --> 18:51.240
from a former Israeli soldier

18:51.880 --> 18:54.600
whose guilty conscience is keeping them, you know,

18:54.600 --> 18:57.680
up at night, and we use all of these, you know,

18:57.680 --> 19:01.400
confessions or slip-ups as evidence

19:01.400 --> 19:04.400
to prove that this is a racist country

19:04.400 --> 19:08.000
that is enacting racist acts, but we don't need this

19:08.000 --> 19:10.080
because the material proof is on the ground.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.040
You see it in the policies that are enacted.

19:12.040 --> 19:16.040
You see it in how the country,

19:16.040 --> 19:20.120
how this regime has behaved for the past 75 years.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.160
I don't need, you know, confessions

19:23.160 --> 19:25.000
from the likes of Netanyahu to understand

19:25.000 --> 19:27.520
that his heart is full of hate.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.560
So if you could return to 1948

19:29.560 --> 19:32.560
and describe something that you've mentioned,

19:32.560 --> 19:36.800
the Nakba, which means catastrophe in Arabic.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.240
What was this event?

19:38.240 --> 19:39.960
What was this displacement and dispossession

19:39.960 --> 19:42.040
of Palestinians in 1948?

19:43.360 --> 19:46.960
Well, you know, like May 15th, 1948

19:47.960 --> 19:51.200
is commemorated every year as, you know,

19:51.200 --> 19:54.320
the anniversary of the Nakba, but I would even argue,

19:54.320 --> 19:58.760
and I think this is like a very popular idea

19:58.760 --> 20:01.640
is that the Nakba did not begin or end in 1948.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.440
The 48 was rather, you know, a crystallization

20:05.440 --> 20:07.680
of the Zionist enterprise in Palestine.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.960
And what happened was is that many Zionist paramilitaries

20:14.960 --> 20:19.960
that, again, today merged and made the Israeli army,

20:21.520 --> 20:23.600
which calls itself the Israeli Defense Forces,

20:23.600 --> 20:25.960
even though they're literally always aggressor,

20:28.040 --> 20:30.400
committed atrocities and massacres,

20:30.400 --> 20:35.400
and, you know, they destroyed over 500 villages.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.960
They killed over 15,000 people.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.760
They forced a very large portion,

20:42.760 --> 20:45.400
a majority of the Palestinian population

20:46.480 --> 20:49.920
to flee their homes, and this was, you know,

20:49.920 --> 20:52.240
the near total destruction of Palestinian society

20:52.240 --> 20:54.240
that continues on to this day.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.320
We refer to it as the ongoing Nakba,

20:56.320 --> 20:59.320
and you see it in Sheikh Jarrah, you see it in Silwan,

20:59.320 --> 21:01.600
you see it in Hebron, and all of these people

21:01.600 --> 21:05.880
losing their homes, and in many cases, time and time again,

21:05.880 --> 21:07.840
you know, I grew up, and my grandmother told me

21:07.840 --> 21:09.360
the stories about the Nakba.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.320
She told me stories about her neighbors

21:11.320 --> 21:15.440
who were running away in a panic,

21:15.440 --> 21:18.720
and they had mistaken a pillow for their offspring,

21:18.720 --> 21:19.800
and they just took it with them,

21:19.800 --> 21:21.600
and they realized later that they forgot their child,

21:21.600 --> 21:24.400
and they came back for many, many people

21:24.400 --> 21:27.400
who were separated from their, my grandmother herself,

21:27.400 --> 21:30.040
she lost her husband for a few months, for nine months.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.680
He was imprisoned by the Israelis.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.120
You know, she told me all of these stories,

21:37.120 --> 21:39.680
and she wasn't just reminiscing about them.

21:39.680 --> 21:44.280
She was, you know, letting me know

21:44.280 --> 21:46.640
that this is still happening,

21:46.640 --> 21:49.720
and I didn't need to grow up that old

21:49.720 --> 21:52.080
to see it happening in my own front yard,

21:52.080 --> 21:55.960
to see that expulsion happen in the same fashion

21:55.960 --> 21:59.760
she's talked about it, but, you know,

21:59.760 --> 22:03.360
now they have replaced their artillery with the judiciary.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.680
They have replaced, you know, the slashing

22:07.680 --> 22:10.120
of the pregnant women's bellies

22:10.120 --> 22:13.600
in the Daryusin massacre with laws that say,

22:13.600 --> 22:16.280
you know, you're not legally allowed to be here.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.120
We're gonna kick you out of your home,

22:18.120 --> 22:22.920
and it's happening, and it has happened in broad daylight.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.960
One piece of context for the listener who doesn't,

22:27.960 --> 22:30.560
who is not familiar with the Nakba

22:30.560 --> 22:34.400
is the Balfour Declaration, which was a promise,

22:34.440 --> 22:37.360
quote unquote, promise made by the British

22:37.360 --> 22:40.840
to the Zionist movement in 1917,

22:42.520 --> 22:43.920
committing to the establishment,

22:43.920 --> 22:45.400
I'm quoting, I think, word for word,

22:45.400 --> 22:46.560
committing to the establishment

22:46.560 --> 22:48.320
of a Jewish state in Palestine,

22:49.720 --> 22:53.240
as if Palestine was, you know, the British to give away.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.160
And there was this whole movement

22:57.160 --> 23:01.200
that called for colonization of Palestine,

23:01.200 --> 23:03.840
and there were different schools of thought

23:03.840 --> 23:06.680
in Zionism, you know, people like Zengwel

23:06.680 --> 23:09.040
said that this was a country without a people.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.800
And Palestinians who have existed there,

23:12.800 --> 23:15.200
who have cultivated the lands, who have, you know,

23:16.640 --> 23:18.760
had diverse cultural and religious

23:18.760 --> 23:24.760
and political practices, they were completely erased.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.760
And other people like Zabotinsky

23:29.960 --> 23:32.000
were a lot more explicit and a lot more honest

23:32.000 --> 23:34.640
and said that we need to fight the Palestinians

23:34.640 --> 23:36.000
because they love their land,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.880
much like the Red Indians love their lands.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.920
And he had a paper called

23:40.920 --> 23:44.280
the Iron Wall Colonization of Palestine Must Go Forward.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.400
And all of these schools of thoughts

23:49.400 --> 23:52.480
were then shopping around for, you know,

23:52.480 --> 23:56.000
imperialist support for their cause.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.080
They tried to get support from the Ottoman Empire.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.000
They tried to get support from Germany.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.040
And this is in the 1800s.

24:06.040 --> 24:09.840
And then they got support from the United Kingdom.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.760
A great book to recommend is

24:11.760 --> 24:15.040
The Hundred Years War on Palestine by Rashid Khalidi.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.720
That, you know, traces the Zionist movement,

24:19.720 --> 24:22.320
oftentimes in Zionist own words.

24:24.080 --> 24:27.280
And so today what we're seeing is a continuation.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.960
And, you know, people like Zabotinsky

24:28.960 --> 24:31.640
who are like profoundly and explicitly racist,

24:31.640 --> 24:33.640
who have called for genocide,

24:33.640 --> 24:36.720
who have called the Palestinians barbaric,

24:36.720 --> 24:41.040
who have said and done racist things.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.880
You know, Zabotinsky also was like the founder of the Ergun,

24:43.880 --> 24:47.080
one of the other militias that later merged

24:47.080 --> 24:49.680
to become the Israeli army,

24:50.920 --> 24:52.920
which was responsible for the Deir Yassin massacre,

24:52.920 --> 24:54.440
which was responsible for the bombing

24:54.440 --> 24:55.640
of the King David Hotel.

24:56.640 --> 25:01.160
This is a person who's still celebrated in Israeli society.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.960
There are streets named after him,

25:02.960 --> 25:04.920
and Netanyahu just two weeks ago,

25:04.920 --> 25:09.400
if I'm not mistaken, honored him in a public celebration.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.880
So this is Zionism.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.240
It's not even through my own words.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.760
What do you say to people

25:17.320 --> 25:21.640
that describe Israel as having historical right to the land?

25:21.640 --> 25:23.880
So if you stretch, not across decades,

25:23.920 --> 25:25.760
but across centuries into the past.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.920
This kind of thing is a red herring.

25:28.920 --> 25:32.560
It's a distraction because you don't think of any state

25:32.560 --> 25:34.160
as having rights.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.120
But there is this exceptionalism to the Israeli regime

25:37.120 --> 25:39.440
where it has a right to defend itself

25:39.440 --> 25:40.520
and it has a right to the land

25:40.520 --> 25:43.240
and it has a right to shoot 14-year-old boys

25:43.240 --> 25:47.840
because it thought they had a knife in their pockets.

25:47.840 --> 25:48.800
You know, a lot of the time,

25:48.800 --> 25:51.920
people cite the Torah and cite religious books.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.360
And sometimes Zionists will even say,

25:54.360 --> 25:56.800
read the Quran and blah, blah, blah.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.560
Regardless of whatever was written in these books

25:59.560 --> 26:01.760
that were written thousands and thousands of years ago,

26:01.760 --> 26:04.760
the fact of the matter is no one has a right

26:04.760 --> 26:06.600
to go on slaughtering people,

26:06.600 --> 26:08.040
removing them from their homes,

26:08.040 --> 26:10.240
and then continuing to live in their homes,

26:10.240 --> 26:12.640
continuing to drink coffee on their balconies

26:13.760 --> 26:16.560
decades and decades later with no shame,

26:16.560 --> 26:20.040
with no introspection, with no reflection.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.720
No one has the right to do that.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.000
No one has the right to keep an entire population of people

26:25.000 --> 26:28.600
in a cage, which is what's happening to people

26:28.600 --> 26:32.760
in the West Bank who have no freedom of movement,

26:32.760 --> 26:35.560
which is what's happening in Gaza,

26:35.560 --> 26:39.120
which is blockaded to water, air, and land

26:39.120 --> 26:43.160
and is deemed uninhabitable

26:43.160 --> 26:45.800
by human rights organizations like the UN.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.000
No one has the right to do that.

26:48.040 --> 26:51.560
Do you have hate in your heart for Israel?

26:51.560 --> 26:52.840
Why does that matter?

26:55.320 --> 26:57.280
As one human being to another,

26:57.280 --> 27:00.680
you're describing quite brilliantly

27:00.680 --> 27:04.400
that the contents of people's hearts don't matter

27:04.400 --> 27:08.000
as much as the policies and the contents of the courts

27:08.000 --> 27:11.480
and the laws and what actually is going on

27:11.480 --> 27:13.320
on the streets in terms of actions.

27:13.320 --> 27:17.880
But this is also a human story.

27:18.520 --> 27:23.520
And I feel like at the core of the situation here

27:29.080 --> 27:34.080
is hate or maybe inability for some group of humans

27:37.320 --> 27:40.520
to see the humanity in another group of humans.

27:40.520 --> 27:41.560
And so it's important here

27:41.560 --> 27:43.880
to talk about the contents of hearts

27:43.880 --> 27:47.560
if we were to think about the long-term future of this.

27:47.560 --> 27:50.760
Yeah, I mean, I would be concerned actually

27:50.760 --> 27:53.840
if I didn't feel some kind of way in my heart.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.560
I would be concerned for my own dignity

27:56.560 --> 27:58.360
because the people who revolt,

27:58.360 --> 27:59.520
the people who are angry,

27:59.520 --> 28:01.800
the people who refuse to live under occupation

28:01.800 --> 28:03.320
know that they deserve better.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.440
People start revolutions

28:06.440 --> 28:09.920
not because of some kind of cultural phenomenon,

28:09.920 --> 28:11.360
not because of some kind of desire,

28:11.360 --> 28:13.760
but because they cannot breathe,

28:13.760 --> 28:17.320
because they cannot breathe, they cannot live.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.640
They are living under excruciating circumstances.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.760
You know, Palestinians, you know, I don't know,

28:22.760 --> 28:25.040
I don't know how many Palestinians have interacted with,

28:25.040 --> 28:27.560
but we are some of the most wonderful people.

28:27.560 --> 28:28.400
I mean, not all of us,

28:28.400 --> 28:30.720
I think some of us are, you know, insufferable,

28:30.720 --> 28:34.400
but most of us, you know,

28:34.400 --> 28:37.320
most of us, you know, we're very hospitable.

28:38.640 --> 28:39.480
We're very hospitable.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.560
Even like in the early correspondence

28:41.560 --> 28:44.840
between the mayor of Jerusalem and Herzl

28:44.880 --> 28:46.920
who wrote The Jewish State,

28:46.920 --> 28:50.000
you know, the generosity through which

28:50.000 --> 28:52.360
the Palestinian mayor was talking to Herzl

28:52.360 --> 28:55.360
who was plotting to take over his land

28:55.360 --> 28:58.440
is impressive and at the same time, you know, heart wrenching.

29:00.720 --> 29:05.400
But I personally think there is,

29:07.080 --> 29:12.080
there's a lot of dignity in negating your oppressor.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.880
And I think it would be ridiculous today

29:14.880 --> 29:17.600
if we like look back at Jim Crow, for example,

29:17.600 --> 29:20.360
and we asked the person who's lived under Jim Crow

29:22.040 --> 29:24.200
if they have hate in their heart for Jim Crow

29:24.200 --> 29:27.440
as if that's not the absolutely logical

29:27.440 --> 29:30.560
and natural sentiment to feel.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.600
In Rifka, you wrote,

29:31.600 --> 29:35.320
my father told me anger is a luxury we cannot afford.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.560
Be composed, calm, still, laugh when they ask you,

29:38.560 --> 29:41.560
smile when they talk, answer them, educate them.

29:44.760 --> 29:45.920
So let me linger on this,

29:45.920 --> 29:48.400
is there anger in there in your heart

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
and does it cloud your judgment?

29:50.400 --> 29:52.000
Does it cloud my judgment?

29:52.840 --> 29:53.760
I don't think so.

29:53.760 --> 29:57.520
I think our campaign to defend our homes

29:57.520 --> 30:02.520
was particularly successful

30:02.560 --> 30:07.480
because it was honest to what was happening on the ground

30:07.480 --> 30:09.480
because it refused to follow the strategy

30:09.480 --> 30:12.240
that we have used in our advocacy before

30:12.240 --> 30:14.600
where we shrink ourselves and we turn the other cheek

30:14.600 --> 30:19.360
and we try to convince American lawmakers

30:19.360 --> 30:22.160
and American diplomats and journalists of our humanity

30:24.120 --> 30:25.520
because we wait for their approval.

30:25.520 --> 30:29.360
You know, I was 14 years old when I first flew to Congress

30:29.360 --> 30:31.240
to speak to Congress people

30:31.240 --> 30:33.720
and to speak at the European Parliament.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.160
Then at the time I thought,

30:35.160 --> 30:38.600
wow, I must be such a brilliant 14 year old

30:39.840 --> 30:41.520
for them to have me here.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.000
And, you know, looking back,

30:43.000 --> 30:44.200
I didn't know what I was talking about.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.400
I had horrendously broken English

30:48.960 --> 30:51.080
and I didn't have any talking points.

30:51.080 --> 30:54.560
And I came to realize that the reason why we send our kids

30:54.560 --> 30:56.920
with their PowerPoints to the Hill

30:56.920 --> 30:59.640
is because of the racism and the hatred that lingers

30:59.640 --> 31:01.840
inside the hearts of American politicians

31:01.840 --> 31:03.920
who refuse to sit on the table

31:04.920 --> 31:07.160
with Palestinian adults as equals.

31:08.400 --> 31:12.480
And so we resort to sending our kids who will not threaten

31:13.840 --> 31:15.840
and who will not, you know, trigger the biases

31:15.840 --> 31:18.040
they have against Muslims and Arab people,

31:18.040 --> 31:20.400
which Palestinians, even though we're not all Muslim,

31:20.400 --> 31:21.840
are racialized as Muslim.

31:23.480 --> 31:27.840
And this is why we emphasize the deaths of women and children

31:27.840 --> 31:30.400
as though the deaths of our men does not count

31:30.400 --> 31:31.800
or does not matter.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.040
All of these things, I think the new generation

31:35.040 --> 31:37.280
of Palestinians is rebelling against.

31:37.280 --> 31:40.760
I think words like, you know, I think it's loaded.

31:40.760 --> 31:44.960
It's loaded language, anger and angry and hate

31:44.960 --> 31:49.520
and so on and so forth, because it mischaracterizes people

31:49.520 --> 31:52.080
and it kind of delegitimizes them a little bit.

31:53.240 --> 31:57.200
You know, I think the real anger is the bulldozer,

31:58.360 --> 31:59.640
bulldozing through my house.

31:59.640 --> 32:02.680
I think the real anger is the 18-year-old soldier

32:02.680 --> 32:04.640
who refuses to see me as a human being

32:04.640 --> 32:07.240
and strip searches me every chance they get.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.200
That's where the real anger lies.

32:11.080 --> 32:15.760
And I'm quite honestly proud of, you know,

32:15.760 --> 32:20.760
our unabashedness and our refusal to like bow our heads

32:21.200 --> 32:23.360
or bury our heads in the sand.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.600
I think that's the only way forward.

32:25.600 --> 32:30.560
So anger, whatever it is, is a fuel for action.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.200
Absolutely, and it has been throughout history.

32:34.200 --> 32:35.040
It has been.

32:35.960 --> 32:39.120
How much of this tension is religious

32:40.880 --> 32:43.320
in the practical aspects of the courts

32:43.320 --> 32:47.680
and the evictions and the demolitions?

32:47.680 --> 32:51.320
And you mentioned something, divine decree.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.480
How much underneath of it do you feel

32:54.480 --> 32:58.120
the division over religious texts and religious beliefs?

33:00.120 --> 33:02.440
You know, it's convenient to market

33:03.320 --> 33:05.520
what's happening in Palestine as a religious conflict

33:05.520 --> 33:10.120
because it allows the listener the luxury

33:10.120 --> 33:13.280
of believing that this is an ancient complicated thing

33:13.280 --> 33:15.960
that stretches thousands and thousands of years ago.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.480
But the fact of the matter is,

33:19.280 --> 33:21.400
the people who invented Zionism,

33:21.400 --> 33:22.840
who pioneered the Zionist movement,

33:23.080 --> 33:27.120
who called for emigration and settling into Palestine,

33:27.120 --> 33:29.120
a lot of them were atheists.

33:29.120 --> 33:32.040
A lot of them were not religious at all.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.200
And the leaders of the Israeli state today,

33:37.200 --> 33:40.160
a lot of them are atheists,

33:41.640 --> 33:44.120
and a lot of them are secular and so on and so forth.

33:44.120 --> 33:49.120
It's easy to say that this is, you know,

33:49.320 --> 33:52.920
about Muslims and Jews fighting over the land

33:52.920 --> 33:54.440
and so on and so forth.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.280
But it's not, it's about the land itself

33:56.280 --> 34:00.480
and it's about people being forced out of their homes.

34:00.480 --> 34:04.920
Benjamin Netanyahu said anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.120
Of course he said that.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.120
Do you disagree?

34:09.120 --> 34:11.040
Absolutely, I disagree.

34:11.040 --> 34:15.600
What's the gap between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism?

34:15.640 --> 34:19.480
Those who are against the policies of Israel

34:19.480 --> 34:24.440
versus those who are against the Jewish people?

34:25.440 --> 34:28.240
I watched the, well, the first like 20 minutes

34:28.240 --> 34:30.280
and then I couldn't do it anymore, you know?

34:30.280 --> 34:32.680
But I watched and then what was interesting

34:32.680 --> 34:34.480
about Netanyahu is that he said, you know,

34:34.480 --> 34:39.000
being anti-Zionist is like saying I'm okay with the Jews.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
I just don't believe the Jews have a right

34:41.000 --> 34:42.840
to form their own state.

34:42.840 --> 34:46.840
That's like saying I'm okay with Americans.

34:46.840 --> 34:50.520
I'm just not okay with Americans having their own state.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.680
And there is so much wrong with that statement

34:52.680 --> 34:56.560
in the sense that Jewish people are a religious group

34:56.560 --> 35:00.240
and Americans, being an American is a nationality

35:00.240 --> 35:05.240
that consists of a diversity of religions

35:05.600 --> 35:08.880
and so on and so forth, first of all.

35:08.880 --> 35:12.120
And the second thing that's wrong with that statement

35:12.120 --> 35:14.960
is the whole idea that states somehow have a right

35:14.960 --> 35:16.920
to exist or whatever.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.760
It's such a distraction.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.920
You have people getting shot in the street.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.320
You have like millions and millions of people besieged.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.160
You have people losing their homes.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.080
You have people who are held in Israeli prisons

35:28.080 --> 35:32.160
without trial or charge indefinitely.

35:32.160 --> 35:35.520
But the conversations that are being held on the Hill,

35:35.520 --> 35:38.320
the conversations that are being held on CNN

35:38.320 --> 35:40.840
are does Israel has a right to exist

35:40.920 --> 35:43.800
or why would you negate Israel's having a right to exist?

35:43.800 --> 35:44.640
That's one.

35:44.640 --> 35:49.640
Now, of course, I just find it's ridiculous,

35:49.680 --> 35:54.160
again, that opposing a secular political movement

35:54.160 --> 35:57.240
that was explicitly colonialist, expansionist,

35:57.240 --> 36:01.400
exclusive and racist through the words of its own authors

36:01.400 --> 36:03.960
is somehow, and also again,

36:03.960 --> 36:07.080
opposing such a political movement

36:07.080 --> 36:10.200
that is quite young and quite recent

36:10.200 --> 36:15.200
is somehow equivalent to opposing a religion

36:15.200 --> 36:17.360
that is thousands and thousands of years old.

36:17.360 --> 36:21.320
But it is convenient, again, for Israeli politicians

36:22.280 --> 36:25.280
to frame us who oppose Zionism,

36:25.280 --> 36:28.840
a form of racism and bigotry as anti-Semites.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.320
But I can guarantee you Benjamin Netanyahu

36:31.320 --> 36:34.080
has no problem with anti-Semitism.

36:34.080 --> 36:37.480
This is the same man who has no problem getting on stage

36:37.480 --> 36:40.960
and shaking hands with Pastor John Hagee,

36:40.960 --> 36:45.760
doing webinars with Pastor John Hagee.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.400
For those who don't know, Pastor John Hagee

36:47.400 --> 36:50.720
is the founder of Christians United for Israel

36:50.720 --> 36:52.800
who has said on multiple occasions

36:52.800 --> 36:57.360
that Hitler was a hunter who was sent to hunt the Jews,

36:57.360 --> 36:59.040
who said on multiple occasions

36:59.040 --> 37:02.560
that Jewish people are gonna perish in hell.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.200
All of this is very viable by Google.

37:05.200 --> 37:10.040
And this is one of the Israeli regime's closest allies, right?

37:11.880 --> 37:15.560
So the Israeli regime does not have a problem

37:15.560 --> 37:18.240
with anti-Semites when it serves its interests.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.080
It has a problem.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.760
I mean, like if you look at evangelicals

37:23.760 --> 37:26.200
or like Christian Zionism at large,

37:26.200 --> 37:31.200
anti-Semitism lies at the heart of Christian Zionism.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.720
It's the idea that we wanna drive all of the Jews

37:33.720 --> 37:36.280
outside of the United States

37:36.280 --> 37:40.320
so that Armageddon could happen or whatever the fuck.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.240
This accusation has been a muzzle.

37:43.240 --> 37:47.360
It has been used as a muzzle to silence political opposition

37:48.560 --> 37:51.000
and to stifle political advocacy

37:51.000 --> 37:53.080
for the liberation of Palestine.

37:53.080 --> 37:57.120
And a lot of the time people get caught up in denouncing it

37:57.120 --> 38:01.520
and in justifying themselves and disclaimers

38:01.520 --> 38:03.840
and so on and so forth, that you lose the point,

38:03.840 --> 38:05.480
that you're distracted from the focal point.

38:05.480 --> 38:09.040
That is, there is an ongoing colonialism happening

38:09.040 --> 38:11.440
where people every single day are killed.

38:11.440 --> 38:16.440
I cannot count this morning a kid was shot in Palestine.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.560
It's embarrassing even for me

38:20.560 --> 38:23.000
that I don't even know the numbers here.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.360
But this muzzle has been effective.

38:25.360 --> 38:29.360
And I think the only righteous option

38:30.240 --> 38:33.600
is to oppose these labels,

38:33.600 --> 38:36.520
these smear campaigns that target us.

38:36.520 --> 38:41.520
I myself have been labeled an anti-Semite by the ADL.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.080
And I mean, if you want to talk about that

38:45.080 --> 38:48.520
at surface level, people will say like,

38:48.520 --> 38:52.440
wow, the ADL, Anti-Defamation League condemned you.

38:52.440 --> 38:53.920
But people do not look at the history

38:53.920 --> 38:55.040
of the Anti-Defamation League,

38:55.040 --> 38:57.800
do not look at the present of the Anti-Defamation League.

38:57.880 --> 39:01.400
The fact that they are the largest

39:01.400 --> 39:05.480
non-governmental police training department in the country

39:05.480 --> 39:09.920
where they train police in racial profiling and militarism.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.640
The fact that they have historically

39:11.640 --> 39:14.920
and continue to have engaged in surveillance

39:16.920 --> 39:20.640
on black liberation movements,

39:20.640 --> 39:22.920
on anti-apartheid South African activists,

39:22.920 --> 39:24.800
most recently in Charlottesville

39:24.800 --> 39:26.800
when white supremacists were marching.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.800
And chanting anti-Semitic shit,

39:30.800 --> 39:35.440
the ADL advised local police departments

39:35.440 --> 39:38.760
to spy on the black organizers

39:38.760 --> 39:41.920
opposing the white supremacists.

39:41.920 --> 39:44.200
This is again, all verifiable on the internet.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.240
Go to droptheadl.org.

39:46.240 --> 39:48.000
So the ADL does not

39:50.400 --> 39:55.400
alleviate the hate in the world

39:55.680 --> 39:58.560
as it probably is designed to do.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.880
No, it's the guys.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.000
I don't think the Apartheid Defense League

40:03.000 --> 40:06.480
is really our most progressive.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.520
That's what it stands for.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.720
Yeah, in case you didn't know, now you know.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.680
If we could just linger on this idea of anti-Semitism,

40:18.840 --> 40:23.360
there's quite a bit of anti-Muslim sentiment

40:23.360 --> 40:26.280
in the United States, especially after 9-11.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.480
I've spoken to people about that.

40:28.480 --> 40:33.480
There's also anti-Jewish, anti-Semitism sentiment

40:33.760 --> 40:37.400
in the United States, but also throughout human history.

40:37.400 --> 40:42.400
What do you make about this kind of fact of human nature

40:43.840 --> 40:47.400
that people seem to hate Jews throughout history,

40:47.400 --> 40:49.880
especially in the 20th century,

40:49.880 --> 40:51.480
especially with Nazi Germany?

40:52.480 --> 40:54.720
What are your, in general, thoughts

40:54.720 --> 40:57.600
about the hatred of the Jewish people?

40:57.600 --> 40:59.520
I mean, I think it's obviously wrong.

40:59.520 --> 41:00.360
I don't know.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.080
It's this idea that I even have to clarify

41:03.080 --> 41:04.640
what I think about anti-Semitism

41:04.640 --> 41:07.320
that doesn't sit right well with me.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.640
I think it's completely unfortunate and wrong

41:09.640 --> 41:13.880
that Jewish people have been persecuted across history.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.360
So one of the criticisms,

41:16.360 --> 41:19.600
I think I read the ADL making this criticism of you,

41:19.640 --> 41:22.400
is maybe you've tweeted a comparison

41:22.400 --> 41:27.120
between Israel and Hitler,

41:27.120 --> 41:31.920
and thereby diminishing the evil that is Hitler.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.120
What would you say to that?

41:34.120 --> 41:36.440
Amos Azar talks about this a lot,

41:36.440 --> 41:39.360
the exceptionalization of Hitler.

41:39.360 --> 41:43.280
Hitler is a deplorable, I don't know,

41:43.280 --> 41:48.280
condemnable, rotten, racist, horrible human being

41:48.280 --> 41:50.760
that belongs in the depths of hell.

41:50.760 --> 41:54.040
Obviously, that goes without saying,

41:54.040 --> 41:58.040
but I am allowed analogy,

42:00.240 --> 42:03.360
and I'm allowed to say whatever I want.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.920
Now, I don't necessarily think that such an analogy

42:07.920 --> 42:10.400
is a good strategy to have,

42:11.800 --> 42:15.800
but at the time, the context came in 2021

42:16.680 --> 42:21.680
when Israeli soldiers and policemen and settlers

42:22.080 --> 42:24.320
were literally burning down our neighborhood,

42:25.400 --> 42:27.080
again, verifiable by Google.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.000
And I tweeted it.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.280
And also, I remember I tweeted something,

42:31.280 --> 42:33.320
I hope every single one of them dies.

42:33.320 --> 42:37.320
And to this day, this is some kind of gotcha for me,

42:37.320 --> 42:38.400
as if I should have tweeted like,

42:38.400 --> 42:41.240
oh, here's the apple pie for every single soldier

42:41.240 --> 42:43.040
that's throwing tear gas in my house.

42:43.800 --> 42:46.800
You know, there is such an exceptionalism

42:51.080 --> 42:52.120
when it comes to Palestinians.

42:52.120 --> 42:53.160
We're not allowed analogy.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.000
We're not allowed expression.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.560
We're not allowed armed resistance.

42:56.560 --> 42:57.920
We're not allowed peaceful resistance.

42:57.920 --> 43:01.080
We're not allowed to boycott because that's anti-Semitic.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.760
We're not allowed to do anything.

43:03.720 --> 43:06.040
So what are we allowed, if I can't boycott,

43:06.040 --> 43:08.120
and that's against American law now to boycott,

43:08.120 --> 43:10.000
and if I can't pick up a rifle

43:10.000 --> 43:11.360
because that's against the law,

43:11.560 --> 43:14.720
and if I can't even tweet my frustration out,

43:14.720 --> 43:15.920
what am I allowed to do?

43:17.920 --> 43:19.640
Maybe Netanyahu can send me a manual.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.320
He's happy with it.

43:21.320 --> 43:25.200
So you've spoken about the taking of homes,

43:25.200 --> 43:30.200
the IDF killing civilians, killing children.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.440
What about the violence going the other direction,

43:34.440 --> 43:38.680
Israelis being killed in part by terrorist action?

43:39.600 --> 43:42.400
Well, it depends on how you define terrorism, right?

43:42.400 --> 43:45.240
Across history, one man's freedom fighter

43:45.240 --> 43:46.760
is another man's terrorist.

43:49.600 --> 43:53.640
I don't necessarily subscribe to the definition of terrorism.

43:53.640 --> 43:57.600
If a foreign army is in my neighborhood,

43:57.600 --> 43:58.960
which it's not supposed to be,

43:58.960 --> 44:03.680
and they're shooting live ammunition at my house,

44:03.680 --> 44:06.240
I'm allowed to do what I'm allowed to do.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.320
And again, this is another yet another case

44:08.320 --> 44:09.440
of Palestinian exceptionalism

44:09.440 --> 44:11.680
because when it comes to Ukraine,

44:11.680 --> 44:15.640
people have no problem seeing Ukrainians

44:15.640 --> 44:20.520
defending their homes, seeing Ukrainians dying for a demand,

44:20.520 --> 44:25.520
seeing Ukrainians making makeshift Molotovs on Sky News.

44:25.520 --> 44:28.560
Sky News was running Molotov making cocktails.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.880
The New York Times ran an article

44:29.880 --> 44:31.680
interviewing a Ukrainian psychologist

44:31.680 --> 44:33.400
who said that hatred, I'm paraphrasing,

44:33.400 --> 44:37.400
but he said hatred for all Russians

44:37.400 --> 44:38.720
is actually a healthy outlet.

44:38.720 --> 44:41.360
The New York Post ran a headline

44:41.360 --> 44:43.880
championing a quote unquote

44:43.880 --> 44:46.160
heroic Ukrainian suicide bomber.

44:47.800 --> 44:52.800
These things we would not even dream of as Palestinians.

44:54.240 --> 44:57.400
We are told to turn the other cheek time and time again.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.000
We're told that we should continue living

45:00.000 --> 45:03.120
inside these enclaves without access to clean water,

45:03.720 --> 45:05.120
without access to the right to movement,

45:05.120 --> 45:06.880
without access to building permits,

45:06.880 --> 45:09.160
without our natural right to expansion,

45:09.160 --> 45:12.240
without a guarantee that if we leave our house,

45:12.240 --> 45:13.640
we're not gonna be shot

45:13.640 --> 45:16.040
and we're supposed to not do anything about it.

45:16.040 --> 45:16.960
That is absurd.

45:16.960 --> 45:21.800
Any person watching this understands this completely.

45:21.800 --> 45:26.120
People understand that if somebody is attacking your home,

45:26.120 --> 45:26.960
you fight back.

45:26.960 --> 45:29.200
If somebody is attacking your family, you fight back.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.880
That is not, but again,

45:31.920 --> 45:33.440
who gets to call who a terrorist?

45:33.440 --> 45:35.000
Who gets to define terrorism?

45:35.000 --> 45:37.320
This is all about who has power.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.720
Who gets to write these laws?

45:38.720 --> 45:40.520
Who gets to write these definitions?

45:41.680 --> 45:46.680
Why is it that American actions in Iraq

45:47.720 --> 45:51.960
is not called terrorism by American politicians?

45:53.360 --> 45:58.360
Violence is like this mutating concept,

45:59.600 --> 46:01.440
and it takes on many shapes and forms.

46:01.960 --> 46:05.400
And if it's in a uniform, if it speaks in English,

46:05.400 --> 46:08.280
if it has blonde hair, it's somehow acceptable.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.120
It's okay.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.640
We make movies about it.

46:12.760 --> 46:16.720
We sell out tickets about it.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.360
We make games about it.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.560
But if it's without a uniform,

46:20.560 --> 46:22.800
if it has a thick accent, if it has a beard,

46:24.800 --> 46:26.280
that's condemnable, that's wrong.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.520
That's terrorism.

46:28.480 --> 46:30.600
Do you think violence is an effective method

46:30.600 --> 46:33.240
of protest and resistance in general?

46:33.240 --> 46:34.560
In general, I think it has been,

46:34.560 --> 46:37.320
but I think I believe in fighting on all fronts.

46:37.320 --> 46:41.680
I don't think violence alone is gonna bring about change.

46:41.680 --> 46:46.680
I think there's so much to do in culture

46:48.240 --> 46:49.600
and shifting public opinion.

46:49.600 --> 46:50.880
There's so much to do in media

46:50.880 --> 46:55.000
and fighting back against media, erasure and censorship.

46:55.200 --> 46:57.720
There's so much to do diplomatically and politically.

46:59.560 --> 47:02.640
And I think I would be naive

47:02.640 --> 47:07.640
if I don't take the power imbalance into consideration.

47:09.040 --> 47:11.600
One side has makeshift weapons,

47:11.600 --> 47:13.960
and the other side is one of the most sophisticated

47:13.960 --> 47:15.640
armies in the world.

47:15.640 --> 47:19.680
So I don't know how effective violence could be in this case.

47:19.680 --> 47:21.840
But if you look at the flip side,

47:21.840 --> 47:24.720
do you see the power of nonviolent resistance?

47:25.680 --> 47:27.920
Martin Luther King, Gandhi,

47:27.920 --> 47:29.960
the power of turning the other cheek.

47:29.960 --> 47:32.880
He spoke negatively about turning the other cheek.

47:34.880 --> 47:38.160
So I sense that doing so has not been effective

47:38.160 --> 47:40.040
for the Palestinian people.

47:40.040 --> 47:43.720
We've turned the other cheek generation after generation.

47:43.720 --> 47:47.320
There is this Zionist trope that is used against us.

47:47.320 --> 47:49.600
They say Palestinian rejectionism.

47:49.600 --> 47:50.960
They say that we reject everything.

47:50.960 --> 47:53.400
But if you look at the history, like our leadership,

47:53.440 --> 47:57.800
the Palestinian authority has given up inch after inch,

47:57.800 --> 48:01.280
has compromised on acre after acre,

48:01.280 --> 48:05.520
has signed deal after deal after deal after deal,

48:05.520 --> 48:08.760
and still there is no peace.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.720
So turning the other cheek is not

48:11.840 --> 48:14.760
the most effective method in my book.

48:14.760 --> 48:17.800
What are the top obstacles to peaceful coexistence

48:17.800 --> 48:19.360
of Israelis and Palestinians?

48:20.480 --> 48:23.000
The occupation comes to mind.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.600
The shoot to kill policies come to mind.

48:25.600 --> 48:28.400
The siege comes to mind.

48:28.400 --> 48:31.000
The asymmetry of the judiciary comes to mind.

48:32.960 --> 48:35.800
The whole system needs to be dismantled.

48:35.800 --> 48:38.240
I will quote my dear friend Rabih Ghabariya,

48:38.240 --> 48:40.280
who's a lawyer who says,

48:40.280 --> 48:41.480
you know the solution,

48:41.480 --> 48:45.400
justice comes about through recognition,

48:45.400 --> 48:48.160
return, and redistribution.

48:49.040 --> 48:51.320
There are millions of Palestinian refugees

48:51.320 --> 48:54.360
who are living in excruciating circumstances

48:54.360 --> 48:56.360
in refugee camps around the world.

48:56.360 --> 48:59.480
There are thousands of Palestinian prisoners

49:01.200 --> 49:04.200
who are held in prisons for defending their homes,

49:04.200 --> 49:07.040
hundreds of which are held without charge or trial,

49:07.040 --> 49:07.960
by the way.

49:07.960 --> 49:11.800
There are many Palestinians who get killed

49:11.800 --> 49:13.400
in broad daylight with no recourse,

49:13.400 --> 49:16.640
journalists and medics and everyday people,

49:16.640 --> 49:19.200
not just the freedom fighters.

49:20.200 --> 49:25.200
We need, again, recognition, return, and redistribution.

49:25.320 --> 49:29.760
And peace comes about when they stop killing us,

49:29.760 --> 49:31.320
when they stop keeping us in a cage.

49:31.320 --> 49:33.600
I mean, that's quite simple.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.640
Can you describe recognition,

49:35.640 --> 49:38.240
redistribution, return, and redistribution?

49:38.240 --> 49:40.720
Return, return, right of return.

49:40.720 --> 49:43.240
The right of return to all of the Palestinian refugees

49:43.240 --> 49:44.520
to their homes.

49:44.520 --> 49:46.360
You know, when I'm driving around Haifa

49:46.520 --> 49:50.000
and I see my grandmother's home

49:50.000 --> 49:52.880
that's now turned into a restaurant,

49:52.880 --> 49:55.080
I could have, you know, I made a joke

49:55.080 --> 49:58.080
in one of my essays recently that had I had that,

49:58.080 --> 50:01.040
I could have had it all, you know, the beachfront views,

50:01.040 --> 50:04.240
her smug attitude, you know, she grew up by the,

50:04.240 --> 50:07.720
she grew up by the sea after she relocated to Haifa

50:07.720 --> 50:10.440
after, you know, Jerusalem.

50:11.840 --> 50:14.080
We want that, we want that.

50:14.080 --> 50:16.800
You know, they're lucky I don't want Netanyahu's home,

50:16.800 --> 50:18.280
but I just want my home.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.120
I just want my home.

50:19.120 --> 50:19.960
We want to return.

50:19.960 --> 50:23.040
I also, there needs, you know, and like,

50:23.040 --> 50:24.800
I believe in the 1960s,

50:24.800 --> 50:27.520
the Israeli government classified 90%

50:27.520 --> 50:30.880
of all of historic Palestine as state-owned land.

50:30.880 --> 50:34.960
This is all land that was owned by Palestinian farmers

50:34.960 --> 50:37.200
who have cultivated their lands for decades.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.560
You know, since the establishment of the Israeli state,

50:39.560 --> 50:43.640
there has been Jewish-only towns popping up

50:43.640 --> 50:46.240
every few years and not one town,

50:46.240 --> 50:48.440
not one Palestinian town has emerged.

50:48.440 --> 50:51.880
We are, even those of us who have Israeli citizenship,

50:51.880 --> 50:54.720
who live outside of the wall are encircled

50:54.720 --> 50:57.200
and cannot have their natural community growth

50:57.200 --> 50:58.240
in their towns.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.000
That needs to change.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.280
That needs to change.

51:01.280 --> 51:03.520
You mentioned the wall, can you describe the wall?

51:03.520 --> 51:06.200
The wall is a nine meter high cement wall

51:07.120 --> 51:10.280
that was finished in 2003.

51:10.280 --> 51:12.600
And if you're American,

51:12.600 --> 51:15.680
you've probably heard the whitewash sanitized version

51:15.680 --> 51:17.960
of the name, which is the security wall.

51:17.960 --> 51:21.040
But it's a wall that literally has stolen

51:22.360 --> 51:26.200
thousands of dunams of land and has ripped apart families.

51:26.200 --> 51:28.320
My mother is a poet or was a poet at some point.

51:28.320 --> 51:32.360
And she had this poem she published in the paper,

51:33.320 --> 51:34.520
called Love Behind the Wall.

51:34.520 --> 51:35.800
And it describes, you know,

51:35.800 --> 51:38.400
it's a poem, but it describes a real life situation

51:39.400 --> 51:43.680
of two families who lived right across the streets

51:43.680 --> 51:46.160
from each other, but were then separated by the wall.

51:46.160 --> 51:48.680
And they would fly balloons, you know,

51:48.680 --> 51:51.120
to see each other from each side of the wall

51:51.120 --> 51:52.960
or something like that.

51:52.960 --> 51:55.760
This, although it sounds absurd,

51:55.760 --> 51:57.680
but it's the reality for many Palestinian families

51:57.680 --> 51:58.800
whose lives were torn apart,

51:58.800 --> 52:03.480
whose livelihoods also were torn apart by the wall.

52:03.480 --> 52:05.600
Maybe this is a good opportunity to talk about

52:05.640 --> 52:07.880
the legal classifications for Palestinians.

52:08.800 --> 52:12.720
You know, Israel, much like any other colonial entity,

52:12.720 --> 52:17.720
was, has divided and fragmented the Palestinian people.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.280
As I said earlier, I have a blue ID,

52:22.280 --> 52:23.880
which means I'm a resident.

52:23.880 --> 52:26.760
A friend of mine who lives in Haifa, for example,

52:26.760 --> 52:29.560
two hours away from me, 150 kilometers,

52:29.560 --> 52:33.520
nothing too bad in this country, has an Israeli citizenship.

52:33.520 --> 52:36.520
He can, you know, travel.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.720
He can enter the West Bank.

52:37.720 --> 52:40.880
He can do a lot more.

52:40.880 --> 52:41.720
He's a citizen.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.880
He can vote if he wants to, not that we want to.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.320
You know, I always see my friends,

52:46.320 --> 52:48.240
oh, you can go to Italy without a visa

52:48.240 --> 52:49.920
because you have an Israeli citizenship.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.200
But, you know, they battle national erasure.

52:52.200 --> 52:55.560
They battle crime in their own communities

52:55.560 --> 52:57.520
because of police negligence.

52:57.520 --> 53:00.880
They battle land confiscation

53:00.880 --> 53:04.200
and have battled land confiscation since the 50s.

53:04.200 --> 53:05.920
Whereas somebody with a green ID,

53:06.880 --> 53:08.280
somebody from the West Bank,

53:09.480 --> 53:11.240
cannot leave the West Bank,

53:12.400 --> 53:15.600
cannot go anywhere without a special permit

53:15.600 --> 53:17.320
and lives behind these walls.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.360
And even within the West Bank,

53:19.360 --> 53:21.920
the West Bank, I think, hilariously,

53:21.920 --> 53:26.080
George Bush described it as Swiss cheese

53:26.080 --> 53:28.040
because of the holes.

53:28.040 --> 53:30.720
Every few, every hundred meters,

53:30.720 --> 53:31.640
there's a new settlement

53:31.640 --> 53:33.360
or there's a new military checkpoint.

53:33.360 --> 53:36.240
So even if you live behind the wall in the West Bank

53:36.240 --> 53:37.400
with your green ID,

53:37.400 --> 53:41.240
even though you're robbed of your right to movement,

53:41.240 --> 53:43.000
you still even can't move from town to town

53:43.000 --> 53:44.160
within the West Bank

53:44.160 --> 53:48.000
without encountering settler violence or military violence

53:48.000 --> 53:49.840
while you're crossing the checkpoints

53:49.840 --> 53:50.960
and so on and so forth.

53:50.960 --> 53:53.360
And then the last category we have

53:53.360 --> 53:55.040
is people who live in Gaza.

53:55.040 --> 53:56.840
We are talking about over 2 million people

53:56.840 --> 53:59.080
who live in an open air prison,

54:01.320 --> 54:03.200
who have no right to movement

54:03.200 --> 54:05.440
but also have no access to clean water

54:05.440 --> 54:08.200
and no access to supplies,

54:08.200 --> 54:09.440
no access to good food,

54:09.440 --> 54:11.760
no access to good healthcare and so on and so forth

54:11.760 --> 54:14.680
who routinely get bombarded every few years.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.360
Gaza is like two hours away from my house.

54:18.360 --> 54:20.960
It feels like an absolute faraway planet

54:20.960 --> 54:25.040
because it's so isolated from the rest of the country.

54:25.040 --> 54:28.920
So imagine all of these different legal statuses

54:28.920 --> 54:32.320
fragmenting your everyday identity

54:32.320 --> 54:34.720
and creating different challenges and obstacles

54:34.720 --> 54:37.960
for you to deal with, for each group to deal with.

54:37.960 --> 54:39.960
You know, it's amazing and impressive

54:39.960 --> 54:42.200
that despite these colonial barriers,

54:42.200 --> 54:47.200
the real cement ones and the barriers in the mind,

54:47.480 --> 54:48.960
despite all of these barriers,

54:48.960 --> 54:51.560
the Palestinian people have maintained

54:51.560 --> 54:53.960
their national identity for 70 years.

54:53.960 --> 54:56.520
That is incredibly impressive

54:56.520 --> 54:58.280
and it also sends a message

54:58.280 --> 55:01.000
that as long as we have a boot on our neck,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.080
we're going to continue fighting.

55:03.080 --> 55:07.440
You know, violence, cracking down on refugee camps,

55:07.440 --> 55:08.720
bombarding refugee camps

55:08.720 --> 55:11.960
is only gonna bring about more violence.

55:11.960 --> 55:14.160
So West Bank is a large region

55:14.160 --> 55:15.840
where a lot of Palestinian people live

55:15.840 --> 55:18.960
and then there are settlements sprinkled throughout

55:18.960 --> 55:21.880
and those settlements have walls around them

55:21.880 --> 55:23.320
with security cameras.

55:23.360 --> 55:24.400
And security guards.

55:24.400 --> 55:25.240
Security guards.

55:25.240 --> 55:28.120
There's almost a million settlers in the West Bank.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.840
And so what are the different cities here,

55:29.840 --> 55:31.040
if you can mention?

55:31.040 --> 55:31.920
In the West Bank.

55:31.920 --> 55:34.320
In the West Bank, Ormala, Jenin, Bethlehem,

55:34.320 --> 55:37.360
Hebron, Jericho, Nablus.

55:37.360 --> 55:38.760
Yeah, Tulsa.

55:38.760 --> 55:40.160
They have their own stories,

55:40.160 --> 55:41.800
they have their own histories.

55:41.800 --> 55:42.640
Yeah.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.040
And it's fascinating also how interconnected they are.

55:45.040 --> 55:46.760
You know, like a friend of mine,

55:46.760 --> 55:50.560
Mona Omari, recently did a documentary report

55:50.560 --> 55:54.640
on the day that Haifa fell during the Zionist invasion.

55:54.640 --> 55:59.640
The Haganah led the Palestinian residents of Haifa

56:00.520 --> 56:02.480
down to the city center.

56:02.480 --> 56:05.560
And as absurd as it sounds,

56:05.560 --> 56:08.520
those of them who stood on the right side of the street

56:08.520 --> 56:11.880
were forced into cars that took them to multiple stops

56:11.880 --> 56:13.720
that would later become multiple refugee camps,

56:13.720 --> 56:17.640
the last of which was Jenin refugee camp.

56:17.680 --> 56:21.440
And those who stood on the left side of the street

56:21.440 --> 56:25.480
were forced to board boats that took them to Lebanon

56:25.480 --> 56:27.840
to become refugee camps, refugees there.

56:28.880 --> 56:32.320
Last month, we saw the Israeli army invade Jenin

56:32.320 --> 56:37.160
in maybe the largest military invasion of Jenin since 2002.

56:39.480 --> 56:42.720
And they killed many people,

56:42.720 --> 56:45.400
they attacked medics and journalists

56:45.400 --> 56:46.840
in broad daylight on camera.

56:46.840 --> 56:49.400
They have destroyed infrastructure

56:49.400 --> 56:50.680
and it was all very painful.

56:50.680 --> 56:54.760
But I think the most compelling aspect

56:55.640 --> 56:59.320
of the raid on Jenin was what followed.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.720
Israeli soldiers at night held their megaphones

57:01.720 --> 57:06.720
and instructed hundreds of Palestinians

57:06.720 --> 57:08.400
to flee their homes.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.960
And they told them, if you don't leave,

57:09.960 --> 57:13.280
if you don't have your hand up in the air,

57:13.280 --> 57:14.600
you will get shot.

57:14.600 --> 57:16.480
And they were forced to leave their homes in the camp

57:17.080 --> 57:18.840
and walk to God knows where.

57:18.840 --> 57:22.000
I can guarantee you, because the Nakba is not that old,

57:22.000 --> 57:25.760
I can guarantee you that some people who were marching

57:25.760 --> 57:27.400
away from their camps, who were chased away

57:27.400 --> 57:29.840
from their homes in the camp in Jenin

57:29.840 --> 57:32.560
were some of the same people who were chased away

57:32.560 --> 57:35.080
from the homes in Haifa in the first place.

57:35.080 --> 57:40.080
This perpetual exile that Palestinian people

57:40.720 --> 57:43.480
continue to live is unbearable.

57:43.480 --> 57:45.440
I mean, in my case, my grandmother was removed

57:45.440 --> 57:48.680
from her home in Haifa in 48,

57:48.680 --> 57:49.960
and then she moved from city to city.

57:49.960 --> 57:53.440
And then in 2009, she saw half of her home taken over

57:53.440 --> 57:55.000
by Israeli soldiers.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.320
My grandmother died in 2020, and two months later,

57:57.320 --> 58:00.800
we got the next expulsion order from the Israeli court.

58:02.840 --> 58:06.640
I'm quite ashamed to admit that I was relieved

58:06.640 --> 58:08.640
that my grandmother had died,

58:08.640 --> 58:12.440
because I did not want her, 103 years old at the time,

58:12.440 --> 58:15.760
to go through yet another Nakba.

58:15.760 --> 58:18.520
And this is the fact for so many Palestinians,

58:18.520 --> 58:20.520
regardless of where they are on the map.

58:21.760 --> 58:24.920
If I may read the description of the situation in Jenin,

58:24.920 --> 58:26.360
and maybe you can comment.

58:26.360 --> 58:29.120
So this is on July 3rd, 4th, and 5th,

58:29.120 --> 58:32.240
just reading Washington Post description.

58:32.240 --> 58:35.480
So this was an Israeli military incursion to Jenin.

58:35.480 --> 58:37.680
The raid included more than 1,000 soldiers

58:37.680 --> 58:40.720
backed by drone strikes, making it Israel's largest

58:40.960 --> 58:42.640
operation in the West Bank since the end

58:42.640 --> 58:46.360
of the second Palestinian uprising in 2005.

58:46.360 --> 58:48.680
The Israeli military said it dismantled

58:48.680 --> 58:52.480
hundreds of explosives, cleared hundreds of weapons,

58:52.480 --> 58:54.480
destroyed underground hideouts,

58:54.480 --> 58:57.080
and confiscated hundreds of thousands of dollars

58:57.080 --> 58:59.680
in quote, terror funds.

58:59.680 --> 59:03.000
Many of the 50 Palestinians who have attacked Israelis

59:03.000 --> 59:06.320
since the start of the year have come from Jenin camp

59:06.320 --> 59:08.080
and the surrounding area.

59:08.080 --> 59:10.000
Palestinian attacks inside Israel

59:10.000 --> 59:13.000
have killed 24 people this year.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
UN experts described the Jenin operation

59:15.000 --> 59:17.200
as collective punishment in quotes

59:18.280 --> 59:19.680
for the Palestinian people,

59:19.680 --> 59:23.760
amounting to egregious violations of international law.

59:23.760 --> 59:27.760
Many of the more than 150 Palestinians

59:27.760 --> 59:29.480
killed by Israelis this year

59:29.480 --> 59:31.480
have also come from these communities.

59:31.480 --> 59:33.800
Palestinian fighters say they need arms

59:33.800 --> 59:36.800
to defend themselves against the Israeli occupation

59:36.800 --> 59:39.000
and military incursions into the camp

59:39.000 --> 59:40.800
during which Palestinian civilians,

59:40.800 --> 59:42.880
including children, have been killed.

59:42.880 --> 59:47.880
So those are the, I would say, different perspectives

59:49.000 --> 59:52.000
on the many people on both sides who have been killed,

59:52.000 --> 59:53.480
many more Palestinians.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.840
Can you comment more about the situation?

59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.480
I mean, I think the Washington Post article

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.280
is a little bit more, you know,

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.920
more careful than other media

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.200
that came out recently about Jenin.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.360
I think, you know, I was listening to a Reuters radio show

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.480
and they failed to ever mention the occupation.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.440
I don't even think this paragraph mentioned

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.440
that Jenin is under occupation by the Israeli forces,

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.560
by the Israeli regime.

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.600
I think this is the most important piece of context

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:28.200
that gets up-secured in our media reporting

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.800
is these cities, these refugee camps,

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.040
are under illegal occupation.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.840
The Israeli army has no business

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.640
being there in the first place.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.280
That is the most, that is the departure point,

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.920
that is the most important piece of context

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.760
that will answer to you why these people

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.600
are arming themselves, many of which, by the way,

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.080
lived through the 2002 massacre and bombardment of Jenin

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.000
and grew up in that violence.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.080
The context that Palestine is under occupation,

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.440
that these Palestinian cities are under occupation,

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.040
that they have to deal with land seizures at all times,

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:10.040
that they cannot leave their towns without a special permit.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.680
All of this will give context to the violence.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.000
And, you know, the thousands of Israeli soldiers

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.880
that raided the camp that day,

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.880
that traumatized an entire generation,

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.000
they think they will quell that generation.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.880
They think that with such bloodshed

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.640
and such barbaric violence,

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.840
destroying infrastructure, attacking medics,

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:36.040
killing people left and right,

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.880
they think with this kind of terror

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.240
that they can, you know, quell people,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.600
tell people that, you know,

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.160
they can guarantee that these kids

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.960
are not gonna grow up and resist.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.960
But that's the opposite of what happens.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.160
One thing about Palestinian people,

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.640
they will not compromise their dignity, you know?

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.480
These people live in,

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.640
I mean, live in dire, excruciating circumstances.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.240
And it is so courageous, in my opinion,

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.040
that they even think to defend themselves

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.520
against one of the most lethal,

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:19.640
one of the most sophisticated armies in the world,

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.160
against a nuclear state that can wipe them out

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.680
in a matter of seconds.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:26.240
But at the end of the day, it's not even about courage.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.640
It's about survival.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.520
They don't do this because, you know,

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.080
of machismo or because of heroic tendencies.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.040
It's because this is about survival.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.280
So to the degree there's violence, it's about survival.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.840
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.240
I think if there was no occupation,

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.040
there would be no violence.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:46.920
It's quite obvious.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.200
And again, people understand this.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.080
I mean, like we saw on Twitter in the recent month,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.760
all of these Israeli propagandists

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.360
who had tweeted pictures of like

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.120
little girls with guns in Ukraine

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.640
and like women making bombs in Ukraine

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.040
and young men carrying their rifles in Ukraine

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.720
and praising them as heroes

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.520
post very similar pictures of Palestinians

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.200
and calling them terrorists.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.280
It's glaring, the double standard.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.440
I don't even need to linger on it.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.800
Well, the double standard is glaring,

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.000
but I also think the glorification of violence

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.880
is questionable.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.160
There's a balance to be struck, of course, but.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.600
Yeah, I mean, I don't think we should be

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.720
glorifying violence at all,

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.720
but I don't think we should be normalizing violence either.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.240
I think that's what it is.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.240
You know, I'll tell you a story.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.520
I was interviewing a person whose brother

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.840
was killed by the Israeli military

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.560
during an Israeli raid on their village.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.720
And the person was so concerned

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:01.120
about whether I was gonna report that

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.040
her brother allegedly had a Molotov cocktail in his hand.

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.360
And I found it absolutely insane, absolutely absurd

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.720
that we can just glance over the fact that there is,

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.720
again, a foreign military in tanks

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.320
with rifles and snipers

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.080
invading the village at 4 a.m. in the morning,

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.040
shooting live ammunition at people's houses,

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:29.880
throwing tear gas.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.560
That we can just glance over, it's normal.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.080
We could just report on it.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.160
No problem, nobody's gonna bat an eyebrow.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:41.160
But the fact that potentially somebody might have

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.680
picked up a Molotov cocktail to throw it

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.560
at this invading army is where we draw the line.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.680
It says a lot.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.600
It says a lot about whose violence is normalized,

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.680
is accepted, is institutionalized,

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.560
is glorified even, right?

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.280
And you walk around Tel Aviv and you see all of the plaques

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:04.280
plastered around the streets of the country, of the city,

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.840
celebrating the battles that they had won,

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.800
the massacres that they had enacted

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:13.120
against the Palestinian people.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.640
But God forbid, God forbid Palestinians

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.520
have any kind of similar sentiment.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.680
So on July 4th during this intense period,

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.560
a Palestinian rammed a car into pedestrians

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.280
at a bus stop in Tel Aviv,

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:31.640
injuring eight people before being shot dead

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.240
by a passerby.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.600
Also that night Hamas fired rockets into Israel

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.400
and then Israel responded with strikes

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.560
on what it said was an underground weapon site.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.400
So just to give some context to the intense violence

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.440
happening here, what do you think

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.760
about Hamas firing rockets into Israel?

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:55.280
Well, it's, the framing makes it seem

01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:00.280
as though like unprovoked Hamas is like firing rockets

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.440
onto Israel, in regards to what I think of Hamas obviously,

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.200
but unprovoked.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.400
But that's not the case.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.600
The propagation is the fact that they are forced

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.400
to live in a cage,

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.080
that they have no access to clean water,

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.600
they have no access to basic rights,

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.560
no access to imports,

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.520
no access to anything that they can't leave.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.160
They're living in a densely populated enclave

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.600
that was deemed uninhabitable by the UN,

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.920
that was deemed an open air prison.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.920
So the rockets in any case are retaliation for the siege.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.920
Let's start there.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:38.760
But again, this is just to prove my point,

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.200
violence begets violence.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.680
Palestinian people are not violent people.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.680
We are not violent people at the core.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.600
And I think what serves this narrative is Islamophobia,

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.920
is xenophobia towards Arabs,

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.600
which I don't have the luxury to write laws about.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.160
By the way, I'm quite frustrated by this.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.560
I am preoccupied and the Palestinian people

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.720
are preoccupied with the material violence

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.240
that we have to deal with on the day to day,

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.960
the demolitions, the bombings, the imprisonment.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:19.640
That's what we're distracted with and busy with

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:22.040
that we can't even talk about the racism,

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.320
the casual racism against us,

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.520
the anti-Palestinian racism being in the media,

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.120
on social media and diplomatic circles.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.600
But all of this racism that has gone unchecked,

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.840
that has not been regulated for decades

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.080
allows for these tropes to continue

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.760
in which Palestinians are promoted

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.520
as these barbaric terrorists.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.400
And the only way we could remedy that situation

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:50.400
is by marketing them as these defenseless victims.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.840
But the fact of the matter is not this simplistic.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.200
Palestinian people are human beings

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.680
who should enjoy a full spectrum of humanity,

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:05.600
which includes rage, which includes disdain,

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.680
which includes happiness and joy and laughter,

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:08.920
which includes celebration,

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.920
which includes all of these things,

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.360
but we're not allowed this.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.760
But we are doing exactly what any people throughout history

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.120
who have been oppressed, who have been colonized,

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.280
who have been occupied have done and continue to do

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.840
as we see in Ukraine, which is celebrated

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.920
by mainstream media.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.800
I'm sorry to keep reiterating this point,

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:34.800
but at this point I am quite,

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:42.440
exhausted by how exceptional Palestine

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.960
and Palestinian resistance is

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.000
when the world tells me time and time again

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.640
that it doesn't have a problem with violence,

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.760
it just has a problem with who does that violence.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.800
Do you in your mind and in the way you see this region

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.080
draw a distinction between the people in power

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.200
versus the regular people?

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.200
So you mentioned the Palestinian people.

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.240
Is there something you can comment on on Hamas

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.640
and the PLO?

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.800
Do you see them as fundamentally different from the people?

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.920
What does Hamas do well?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.200
Where did they fall short?

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:23.000
I think governments, wherever, globally, Annie,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.520
are different from people.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.840
No government is a true reflection of its people.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.840
I think this is even true in the case of Arab countries

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:33.920
that normalize with Israel.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.720
In many of the cases, they're unelected governments.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.520
I think the Palestinian Authority continues to fail.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.440
I think they are subcontractors of the Israeli regime

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.640
through their security coordination.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.320
And also I'd like to use this as an opportunity

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.000
to comment a little bit on the analogy thing,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.120
not to like stray away from the question,

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.600
but the Palestinian Authority two years ago

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.600
killed an opposition activist named Nizar Banat.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.680
It was a horrendous crime.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:15.200
And I was in Ramallah with the people protesting

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.000
against the Palestinian Authority.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.120
And at some point they had their batons,

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.440
the Palestinian Authority police, and they beat us with it.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.400
And many of the people in the crowd

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.560
were liking the Palestinian Authority to Zionism.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.440
I think people, this is what people do

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:35.800
when they are confronted by a great evil.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.200
They liken it to some other great evil.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.320
And this is where the Hitler analogy came from.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.440
Again, I don't think it's like the best strategy

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.080
moving forward, but I refuse to be

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:52.160
criminalized for a little sentence.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.480
But to linger on those in power,

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.360
one of the criticisms towards Hamas and PLO,

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.760
towards the Israeli government,

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:04.480
at least the current coalition government,

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.440
is that there's a lot of incentive

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.440
to sort of perpetuate violence to maintain power.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.560
There's a hunger for power and maintaining that power

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.680
amongst the powerful.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.440
That's the way power works.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.560
So is there a worry you have about

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:29.080
those in power not having the best interests of its people?

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.400
So those in power, the PLO, Hamas,

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.400
not being incentivized towards peace, towards justice?

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.920
Looking at the PA's action today,

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.120
it tells you a great deal about what they're interested in

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.960
and what they're not interested in.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.080
And maybe, yeah, the occupation is in their best interest.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.080
And you can infer similar things looking at Hamas.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.320
But these two entities virtually have no power, even Hamas.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.440
There is the context that Hamas

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.000
is permitted by international law

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.600
to use armed resistance, blah, blah, blah.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.200
Does that mean Hamas is equipped to govern Gaza?

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.040
I don't think so.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.760
Does that mean that people around Palestine

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.760
necessarily want to live under Hamas rule?

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.320
In 2006, Hamas was democratically elected.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.160
I don't know if that's still the case today.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.760
There's a lot to be said,

01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.880
but neither of these entities have any real power

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.360
in perpetuating.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.040
The only body that has access

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.800
that can flip the switch on all of this equation

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.160
is Israelis.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.480
They're the ones who are keeping people in a cage.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:02.160
They're the ones who are wrapping the West Bank

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.400
with a wall.

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.080
Everything else to me is just secondary,

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.760
regardless of what I think personally

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.200
of any of those people.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:12.760
And personally for me, the world I envision,

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.600
not just Palestine,

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.120
the world I envision is a world that goes beyond states,

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.120
that goes beyond this framing of power,

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:27.120
this hierarchy in which some people rule over other people.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.960
This whole idea of nation states,

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.880
be it Israel or any other nation states,

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.320
it's futile, it's not good, it's exclusive.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.880
I think that we can achieve a better world than that.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.840
Well, how do you do a better world?

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.320
Actually, if you just linger on that,

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:48.320
what, politically speaking, geopolitically,

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.920
you have to have representation of the people.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.640
You have to have laws and you have to have leaders

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.440
and governing bodies that enact those laws

01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.920
and all those kinds of things.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.360
You probably need to have militaries

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.080
to protect the people.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.760
Can you not imagine a world without militaries?

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.600
I can imagine it, but we're not in that world.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.760
I'm not saying I have all the answers

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.240
or a PowerPoint in my pocket with the instructions,

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.920
but I'm saying the world I'd like to live in

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:20.960
is one that transcends borders,

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.960
is one that does not necessitate militaries,

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.200
that doesn't necessitate all of these prisons,

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:35.200
all of these walls, all of these racist laws.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.440
So you don't think violence is a fundamental part

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:40.720
of human nature that emerges

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.680
and combined with the hunger for power?

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.720
I do think that both of these things

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.560
are truly intrinsic to human beings,

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.080
but I also do think there is a way to move beyond them.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.880
I'm not saying I have the answers.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.920
I'm tempted to say sway, but.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:05.400
But you have a hope that there doesn't have to be war.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.060
In the world.

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:08.420
Definitely.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.740
Well, if we look a little bit more short-term,

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.700
people speak about a one-state solution

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:15.020
and a two-state solution.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:20.180
What is your hope here for this part of the world?

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:23.420
Do you see a possible future with a two-state solution,

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.900
whether it's your Palestine and Israel?

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.460
Do you see a one-state solution

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.420
where there is a diversity of different peoples,

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.700
like in the United States,

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:37.900
and they have equal rights in the courts

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.540
than everywhere else?

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.100
You know, I don't think there is a geography

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.580
in which a two-state solution is possible.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.620
As we said earlier, Swiss cheese,

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:50.300
there is literally settlements all over the West Bank.

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:54.620
And I don't think it's fair.

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:57.580
A two-state solution is fair to all of the people

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:01.140
whose homes are still in Haifa,

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:05.020
in Nazareth, in Jaffa, and so far.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.620
And I don't think it's fair that I'm gonna have to

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.140
travel to another country to visit my cousin

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.140
who's married in Nazareth, for example.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.580
And beyond that, it's just not possible.

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.300
I do believe that whatever we wanna call it,

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:23.260
one state, two states, 48 states, 29 states,

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.900
whatever we wanna call it,

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:29.900
refugees need to return, land needs to be given back,

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:31.940
wealth needs to be redistributed,

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:36.740
and a recognition of the Nakba needs to happen.

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:39.860
That is the only way we could move forward.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:46.300
And regarding whether this is a possible situation

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:49.940
for two people to live side by side,

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.220
let's ask two questions.

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:58.340
Let's say you lived in a house with a person,

01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.700
your roommate, you just had a roommate

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:02.980
who constantly beat the shit out of you.

01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.900
I wonder if you'd wanna continue to live with them.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:06.260
That's one.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.500
And let's try another scenario.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.540
Let's say you live in a house with a roommate

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:13.940
who you just absolutely hate,

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:18.900
just absolutely oppose their existence as a people.

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:23.860
You don't even give him a key to your apartment.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.180
Let's say now you're like equal partners in the apartment.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:29.580
Would you wanna live with him?

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.420
I don't know, we'll see.

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:31.260
We'll see, time will tell,

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:35.460
but I don't think they wanna live with us.

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:38.300
Israelis are quite good, especially Israeli diplomats,

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:43.300
they're quite good at using flowery language

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.940
about peace and coexistence and so on and so forth.

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:51.140
And they're good with making us seem insane or radical

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.500
or full of hate and so on and so forth.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.820
But the policies speak for themselves,

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.740
the actions on the ground speak for themselves.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:05.780
And I truly, I mean, every time there's an uptick,

01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.540
many of them leave and I wonder, I would like to see,

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:12.980
I wonder what would happen in a one-state solution.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.700
Well, okay, so you've spoken eloquently

01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.420
about the injustice of the evictions,

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:21.340
the demolitions, the settlements.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:27.500
But is there, can you comment about the difficulty

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.140
of the security from an Israel perspective

01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:32.260
when there is a large number of people

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.940
that want to destroy it?

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:40.940
How does Israel exist peacefully, this one-state solution?

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:44.540
I don't know, by not shooting a journalist

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.740
doing her job in the Zunni refugee camp.

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:50.820
By not killing a 14-year-old standing in his front yard.

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:55.500
This whole talk about security and security fence

01:18:55.500 --> 01:18:58.260
and the whole propaganda of the Israeli defense forces

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:00.260
and this whole iron wall ideology

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:02.860
in which somehow they are always defending themselves.

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:07.300
Even though they're, Netanyahu and the Israeli government

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:10.780
continue to talk about an existential threat,

01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.700
about Iran being an existential threat.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.700
Even though the Israeli government

01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:21.860
is the only body that holds nuclear weapons in the region,

01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:26.060
they're the most sophisticated army in the region.

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.420
And yet they continue hiding behind their fingers

01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:30.260
and talking about an existential threat

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.580
and talking about how like they're insecure

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.460
and so on and so forth.

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:39.460
I came here on the bus, I live in a house

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.620
where everybody in the world can easily Google it

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:48.580
and get its address and anybody can just walk into my house.

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:52.380
And this is just, and I'm lucky and privileged

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.980
as a Palestinian journalist.

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.220
There are many Palestinian journalists

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.340
who lose their lives.

01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.420
This is like, that's real insecurity,

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.700
but we don't even have time to whine about it

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:04.180
because there's real shit going on on the ground

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:06.780
that we're preoccupied with and reporting on all the time

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.060
that we don't even have the time to talk about

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:12.100
how limited is our institutional backing,

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:16.740
how limited is our cyber security,

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:19.620
how limited is our, even healthcare,

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.300
like all of these things,

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.860
we don't even have time to complain about.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.860
But they're the real life things

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.700
that formulate an insecure population

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:34.940
that Israel certainly does not suffer from.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:37.660
There's a tension here.

01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:41.060
It's true that the ideas of existential threats

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.380
to a nation have been used

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.500
to expand the military industrial complex

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.900
and to limit the rights of its people.

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.620
So in the United States, after 9-11,

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.740
Iraq and Afghanistan were invaded

01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.140
under some justification of there being terror in the world,

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.460
these big ideas.

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.900
And in the same way, yes,

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.660
Israel with the existential threat of Iran

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:08.500
is used to expand its military might over the region

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.060
and control over the region.

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:12.660
But it also has some truth to it

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:16.700
in terms of the threat that Israel is facing,

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.300
including from Iran.

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.380
If Iran were to get a nuclear weapon,

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:24.660
do you think there's a threat from that?

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.940
But who has the nukes?

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.780
Right now.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:31.460
Yeah, but like we're talking about this far away monster

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:34.860
that's like, we're scared of, it's like fear mongering.

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.340
What do you mean?

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.380
Who has the nukes?

01:21:37.380 --> 01:21:38.780
Some of it is fear mongering,

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:42.260
but some of it is true.

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:43.580
I don't think it's true.

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:44.420
I don't think it's true.

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.340
I think Israelis are obsessed with genocide

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.460
because they have enacted genocide against us.

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.220
Even when we talk about like a future,

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.140
a liberation of Palestine,

01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:56.660
when we're talking about anything,

01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:00.420
they constantly jump to saying things like,

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.740
oh, they wanna throw us into the sea.

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.260
They wanna kill all Jews.

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.220
What kind of hyperbolic bullshit is that?

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:11.100
To say that if I am chanting and marching for my home,

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:15.180
not to be taken away from me by some kind of settler court,

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.140
I am somehow demanding the murder

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.460
of all Jews across the world.

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.900
That is hyperbolic.

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:23.220
And the fact that we coddle it is insane to me.

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:26.380
So no, I don't think as things stand right now,

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:29.060
as the power of balance stands right now,

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:32.140
I don't think there's an existential threat to Israel.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:34.780
And also let's redefine what existential threat.

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:39.140
Do we think Israel, the Israeli regime,

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.860
the Zionist regime should continue to exist in its forms,

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:45.180
subjugating people, enacting the crime of apartheid

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:49.300
according to a bajillion human rights organizations?

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.660
Do we think that it should continue

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.100
keeping people in a cage?

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.940
If that's what people are fighting to save,

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:56.940
then that says a lot about the people

01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.660
who are feeling this existential threat, not me.

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:03.780
Do your beliefs represent the Palestinian people,

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:06.340
meaning how many people are there

01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:10.500
that want Israel to be gone?

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.860
But what does it mean for Israel to be gone?

01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:15.060
What it means is for people

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:17.660
who think of Israel as an occupier,

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.300
who stole land that needs to go away,

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.220
that this should be all Palestine.

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.620
Yeah, but is that a bad thing for these borders to be,

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:27.100
like for the occupation to end,

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.660
for the land to be given back, is that a bad thing?

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:33.540
Well, there's different definitions of occupation.

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:36.260
There's people in their homes now, right?

01:23:36.260 --> 01:23:37.380
But is it their home?

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:42.380
I'm not talking about like some random home,

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:47.140
but there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many,

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:50.260
many, many, many, many, many Israelis

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:52.060
who drink their coffee every morning

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.060
from living rooms that are not theirs.

01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:01.380
That are not theirs that were taken just a few decades ago.

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:04.300
Yeah, where like the owners,

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.020
the rightful owners of these homes are still lingering

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.140
and refugee camps are still dreaming of return.

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:15.260
There are homes on the land of Israel

01:24:15.260 --> 01:24:17.180
that you wouldn't classify as stolen.

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:21.500
I mean, there is, like if it wasn't stolen,

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:25.460
like if it was built, but is the land stolen, right?

01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:29.620
But all of this, again, I try not to like fall into this

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:33.980
because it just like, it feels so abstract and far away.

01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:38.540
And this is not how liberation is gonna look like whatsoever.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:42.340
And I'm not like, I'm not fixated on ethnic cleansing.

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.940
That is not, I'm not obsessed with ethnic cleansing.

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:48.780
I'm obsessed with ending the ethnic cleansing campaign

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:52.980
that has been visited upon me and my family

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:55.540
and my community for seven plus decades.

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.260
That's what I'm obsessed with.

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.260
All of this other stuff about what happens to the settlers

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:04.420
and like, you know, we wanna kill all Jews and all of this.

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.260
I think it's bullshit and I think it's ridiculous.

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:09.060
And I think, you know, I'm fixated on it

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.420
is like distracting from the focal point.

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.820
There needs to be an end to all of the injustices,

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.620
to all of the atrocities.

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:20.260
You know, a little boy from Jerusalem

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:22.420
should be able to go jog around the city

01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:24.060
without fear and getting shot.

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.420
That's like the simplest thing we're asking for here.

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:28.700
And we want our land back.

01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:33.260
And those things do not mean actually at all

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.260
the ethnic cleansing of another people.

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:39.260
Well, but that, we should be precise here.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:43.260
So a little boy being able to run around Jerusalem,

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:46.140
that's a great vision, not just safely,

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:51.020
but without racism, without hate.

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:52.780
That's a beautiful vision, yes.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.260
But people in West Jerusalem,

01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.340
people in Tel Aviv that have homes,

01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:01.220
should they stay there?

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.940
Do they have the right to stay there?

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:06.340
That's like maybe number 99 on my priorities list.

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.820
I'm concerned with the refugees.

01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.940
I'm concerned with the teenagers in the prisons.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.500
I am concerned with my house.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.900
I'm concerned with my family's house in Haifa.

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:20.180
I'm concerned, there's a lot for me to do

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:25.180
before I can even tend to the needs of my occupier.

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:28.460
Yeah, that is the least of my concerns.

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.100
So you want the low hanging fruit,

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:32.340
the obvious injustices to end.

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.180
Yeah.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:36.540
But still, the long-term vision

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:42.180
of existential survival of Israel,

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.100
which is the concern of its government,

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.860
is the concern of its people,

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.460
do you see a future where Israelis

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.940
have a home in the region?

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.660
Sure, just not in my front yard.

01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:57.140
Which, where's the front yard and where's the back yard?

01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:59.700
There are literally Jewish settlers,

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:03.380
one of which from Long Island in my literal front yard.

01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:06.340
And this is the case in hundreds,

01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.100
if not thousands of Palestinian homes.

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:13.020
No one is saying Jewish people shouldn't exist

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:16.380
or they shouldn't have a state of their own.

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:20.860
I mean, I think all religious-based states

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.940
are a bad idea, all nation states are a bad idea,

01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:24.900
but whatever, if that's what they wanna do,

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.380
that's what they wanna do.

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.020
But that doesn't mean that they are allowed

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:32.500
or have a right to create and implement

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:36.380
a system of Jewish supremacy at my expense.

01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:38.740
That's not a crazy thing to say.

01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:41.420
That is not a controversial thing to say.

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:44.540
You can have your state, just don't kill anyone.

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.140
Thank you, have a good day.

01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.020
That's not a crazy thought to have.

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:53.980
And seek and establish a symmetry of power in the courts,

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:56.580
which is the current source of injustice.

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:57.820
I mean, that's when it comes to

01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.140
forced expulsions in our home,

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:03.380
but there's a myriad of other ways.

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:04.380
Through the military?

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:07.220
The military, I mean, the police.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.940
If you look at how many times,

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.580
I should have brought the data with me,

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:13.900
but if you look at how little times the Israeli military

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.260
or police has investigated,

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:19.140
its own people are indicted, its own people.

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:21.820
I mean, just recently, the killer

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:27.780
who has been hailed a hero by some of Israeli society,

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:31.940
who killed a Palestinian man who is autistic,

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.460
who lives inside the occupied old city,

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.020
where, again, Israeli military has no business

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.260
being there or jurisdiction whatsoever.

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:41.060
He was shot and killed by an Israeli soldier

01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:43.100
who was trigger happy because, again,

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:45.860
they have this siege mentality

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:48.140
where any moving object is gonna kill them.

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.180
And he was shot and killed.

01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:52.420
And despite it being in broad daylight,

01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.300
despite it being well-documented,

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:57.620
despite the victim being disabled, despite all of this,

01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:00.340
he was acquitted by the Israeli court.

01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.100
The military, the courts, the government,

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:05.420
they all work together, which is why it's so ironic to me

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.740
that there are hundreds of thousands of people

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.820
marching on the streets of Tel Aviv,

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:14.380
trying to save the progressive beacon

01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:16.540
that is the Israeli Supreme Court,

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:21.340
when you find its fingerprints all over the injustices,

01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:23.180
perpetuated against Palestinians,

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:28.180
be it legalizing and upholding the withholding

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.980
of slain Palestinian bodies

01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:32.500
who were killed by the Israeli military

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.460
to be used as bargaining chips with Israeli militaries,

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:40.460
be it making decisions to dispossess entire villages,

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.860
like Im el-Hiran,

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:46.860
be it never once granting release to any Palestinian

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:50.980
who was held in administrative detention

01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:52.660
without charge or trial,

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:57.100
be it upholding the legality of the family reunification law

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:59.940
that does not allow Palestinian couples

01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:01.980
who hold different legal statuses

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:05.180
of reuniting and living together as families.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.660
Those are just some of the few things I can think of

01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.980
about the Israeli Supreme Court.

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:15.980
So the real tension that exists is the lack of diversity

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:20.940
on the Israeli political spectrum

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:24.820
that makes the vision for a future so limited

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:28.940
because those on what seems to be the far left

01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:34.780
are defending an extremely conservative institution

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:39.140
that is a Supreme Court that they regard as progressive

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:42.620
when in fact it is the opposite of such.

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:44.020
So what do we do?

01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.420
How can we talk?

01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:48.580
How can we have peace with people

01:30:48.580 --> 01:30:53.180
who are chanting to save the very body

01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:55.100
that is displacing us?

01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.420
It's ridiculous.

01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.860
What's your vision?

01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.660
Let's just take it as a microcosm of Jerusalem.

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.220
What's your vision for Jerusalem looks like

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:06.580
with a peaceful coexistence of people?

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:13.940
As it looked like before the Israeli state emerged,

01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:17.220
we should be reading our history here.

01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:20.220
When you read European and white historians,

01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:24.860
they'll tell you Palestine was barren.

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.260
Many of them would say like it was even without a people,

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:29.180
there were nobody, nobody was there

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:32.180
or like some of them will say we were uncivilized.

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:34.860
But the fact of the matter is Palestine,

01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:39.060
Jerusalem particularly had a diversity of religion,

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.900
Druze, Jewish people.

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:43.980
My grandmother continues to talk about,

01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:45.700
well, she continued until she died.

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.780
She continued to talk about her Jewish neighbors

01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:50.300
when she grew up in the old city,

01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:51.740
well, like when she was born in the old city

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:55.460
and then her Jewish neighbors in Haifa.

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:58.700
We even had one Jewish member of our family,

01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:03.700
M. Sammy actually, who just also recently passed away.

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:08.500
Jews were a part of Palestine and they spoke Hebrew,

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.460
a different kind of Hebrew, but they spoke Hebrew

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:11.300
and they were,

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:13.940
people really need to read the 100 years war on Palestine.

01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:16.780
It's really an excellent synopsis of the history.

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.740
But this whole idea that this is like some kind of war

01:32:19.740 --> 01:32:22.780
between two religions is so misleading

01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:27.340
because what's happening is a bunch of frankly

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:29.580
European settlers with a certain political

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:33.780
secular ideology came and relocated here

01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:36.100
and turned it into a religious conflict

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.460
between people who have lived harmoniously together

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.980
for decades before that.

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:45.980
And the whole idea, be it like Christian Zionism

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:49.500
or John Hagee or like the calls for Jews

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.380
to leave the United States and relocate in Israel

01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:57.380
or like recently, which we've heard about a long time ago,

01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:02.140
but recently an Israeli historian confirmed the fact

01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:07.060
that Israeli organizations were bombing Baghdad

01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:09.780
and bombing synagogues in Baghdad, in Iraq

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:13.940
to get Iraqi Jews to leave and come relocate in Israel.

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.540
All of this is manufactured.

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.340
And again, none of this is a conspiracy theory.

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:18.580
I know it sounds absurd.

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:22.500
And anytime I look at my life from a bird's eye view,

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.700
I think, what a circus, but it's real

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:30.700
and it's verifiable, call the fact checkers.

01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.820
You mentioned the land registry.

01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:34.940
Can you elaborate what's happening there?

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:35.780
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:40.780
So our small victory in the Israeli courts

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.300
was that they would keep us in our homes

01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:47.780
until a land registry is completed.

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:51.900
Basically, it means that they have to check

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:55.100
who owned the land prior.

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:57.860
And then they could decide if the land is ours

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:01.300
or the land belongs to the Israeli settler organizations

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.140
that are headquartered in the United States

01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:05.580
and enjoy a tax exempt status here.

01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.020
And that sounds great on the surface,

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:11.500
but then you look at Israeli law,

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.660
you look at the Israeli courts, you look at ownership,

01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:16.220
and you see that, oh, Israelis refuse

01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:19.540
to authenticate or take into consideration

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:22.500
any land ownership documents from the prior

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.420
of the establishment of the state.

01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:29.260
So all of us in Jerusalem who have their taboo papers,

01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:32.820
their ownership papers from the Ottoman era,

01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:35.540
that's not legit in the eyes of the Israeli court

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.460
because that existed before,

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:40.380
like your ownership deeds existed long before

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.700
Israel even existed.

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:43.940
So we're not gonna take this into consideration.

01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.620
So not to be cynical here,

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:51.620
but unfortunately the likely result of the land registry

01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:52.580
is that they're gonna say,

01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:55.700
oh, all of this land belongs to these Jewish organizations

01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.660
because they're not gonna take any of our documents

01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:59.180
into consideration.

01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.580
But that means that there's going to be another campaign

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:04.020
and there's gonna be a long winded fight

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.860
and we'll see what happens.

01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:07.020
But that's the fear.

01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:10.380
And there's a huge dreadful fear

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:12.420
of a massive loss in property in Jerusalem

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.980
following this land registry

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:15.220
for the reasons I just told you.

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.620
It's the mere fact that they just refuse

01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:19.460
to look at land ownership documents.

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:22.660
What is the process of fighting this in the courts

01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:25.260
look like if you can maybe just comment on it?

01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:26.300
So there's-

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.220
I always make a joke that being in an Israeli court

01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:31.020
is like playing a game of broken telephone

01:35:31.020 --> 01:35:32.620
because everybody's speaking in Hebrew

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.460
and then your lawyer says something to your dad

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.340
and your dad says something to your mom

01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:38.900
and your mom whispers it in your ear

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.380
and then you're like,

01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:41.220
you say it to your cousin

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:43.140
and your cousin has like a completely different idea

01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.940
of the verdict than what the verdict is.

01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:46.260
But that's really the reality.

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:48.860
So a lot of the fights happen family by family?

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:50.700
No, it's like groups.

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:53.260
So like in our case, it's like four houses,

01:35:53.260 --> 01:35:54.420
every four houses.

01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:57.900
But again, it happens in a language we do not speak

01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:01.220
and a lot of the time our strategy is buying time

01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:04.020
and building a global campaign.

01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:06.660
Like we know that there is no recourse

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:09.060
in the Israeli courts.

01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:10.340
I mean, my grandmother used to say,

01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:12.380
and this is like a popular proverb,

01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:16.900
if your enemy is the judge, to whom do you complain?

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.940
So to the whom you complain

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:22.100
is maybe the international community.

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:23.940
Yeah, I mean, in our case,

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.220
it was the international community,

01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:26.100
but in our case also,

01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:27.700
it wasn't just the international community.

01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:32.060
It was the hundreds of thousands of people in Palestine

01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:36.260
and abroad who were marching on the streets,

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:39.020
getting beaten and brutalized in Jerusalem.

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.540
And I don't know, sometimes arrested in places like Germany

01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:43.700
and so on and so forth,

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:47.020
who forced themselves inside the media cycle.

01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:49.620
This was what was unique about Shahr Jarrah.

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:52.140
We were able to penetrate an industry

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.980
that usually ignores us and usually refuses to use

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:57.460
any of our framing, any of our quotations.

01:36:57.460 --> 01:37:00.260
And these people that marched,

01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:03.060
these people that spread the rhetoric,

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:05.260
spread the facts, wrote articles,

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:08.660
these people that made videos online and got arrested.

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:10.260
And many of whom are still in Israeli prisons

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.780
paying higher prices than I have ever paid.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:15.420
These people are the ones that truly moved

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:18.460
the international community into action.

01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:19.580
It wouldn't have, you know,

01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:22.140
the United States I don't think would have said anything

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:24.780
had it not been for the immense media pressure

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:27.500
that was created from the immense popular pressure.

01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:30.140
There are a lot of moving parts to a global campaign.

01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:32.860
And I think it's so impressive, you know,

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:36.140
that we were able to do this without any media backing,

01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:38.300
without any institutional backing, without any training,

01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:41.500
without any budget, nothing.

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.180
You mentioned the United States.

01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:45.780
What's the role of the United States

01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:47.940
in the struggle that you've been describing?

01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:49.980
What's the positive, what's the negative?

01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:55.740
The role is perpetuating what's happening, Yanni.

01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:58.020
It's all a negative role, to be honest.

01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.700
With the money, with power?

01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:04.700
Yeah, it's like the 3.8 billion in military aid every year.

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:08.380
It's the standing ovation.

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:11.060
Israel is the largest recipient of US foreign aid

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:12.140
since World War II.

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.380
To date, the United States has provided Israel

01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:18.340
$158 billion, as you said,

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:21.460
it's providing currently 3.8 billion every year.

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:25.180
That a lot of people raise the question

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:28.140
of what's the interest of taxpaying American citizens

01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:29.340
in this kind of...

01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:31.700
Yeah, zero interest.

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.060
Foreign aid.

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.340
Zero interest.

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:36.260
I don't think Americans...

01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:37.900
I think Americans, a lot of Americans

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:38.980
are concerned with healthcare.

01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:42.620
A lot of Americans are concerned with clean water in Flint.

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:45.020
I don't think they're concerned with funding apartheid

01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:46.340
in another country.

01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.260
And I think it's a disturbing phenomenon

01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:50.220
that although public opinion in the United States

01:38:50.220 --> 01:38:55.220
is shifting, I would argue drastically about Palestine.

01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:59.900
People in Washington are yet to catch up.

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:02.300
It was only, I think, nine Congress people

01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:07.300
who boycotted Herzog's speech in Congress yesterday.

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.740
And he received standing ovation after standing ovation

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:12.540
after standing ovation after standing ovation.

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:17.540
And I wonder if the everyday American

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:19.940
is concerned that many of their politicians

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:21.500
are Israel first politicians,

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:26.500
or politicians who care more about maintaining

01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:28.780
a relationship with the Israeli regime

01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:30.820
than they care about their own districts.

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:35.220
You've tweeted that 49 years ago,

01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:38.900
Ghassan Qanafani, or you can maybe correct me

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:42.020
on the pronunciation, was assassinated.

01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:43.540
You wrote, quote,

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:46.540
his revolutionary articulations of the Palestinian plight

01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:49.780
for liberation shook the colonial regime,

01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:51.380
yet he's not dead.

01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:54.860
His ideas remain ever-timely and teachable.

01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:57.860
And you also tweeted an excerpt from his writing,

01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:00.380
between 1936 and 1939,

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.940
the Palestinian Revolutionary Movement

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:03.740
suffered a severe setback

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:05.980
at the hands of three separate enemies

01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:08.380
that were to constitute together the principal threat

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:11.660
to the nationalist movement in Palestine

01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:14.140
in all subsequent stages of its struggle.

01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:18.140
One, the local reactionary leadership,

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.980
two, the regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine,

01:40:20.980 --> 01:40:24.140
and three, the imperialist Zionist enemy.

01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:27.340
Can you analyze what he means by those three things?

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.340
The local reactionary leadership,

01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:32.060
the regimes in the Arab states surrounding Palestine,

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.340
and the imperialist Zionist enemy.

01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:37.380
And also, could you comment on him as a person?

01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:40.140
Yeah, I mean, Ghassan Qanafani is a brilliant,

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.100
brilliant, brilliant writer.

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.660
And he was prolific.

01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:47.460
He's authored so much books.

01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.620
Even though he was assassinated in the 70s,

01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:52.140
but he was 37, if I'm not mistaken, 35,

01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:53.380
when he was assassinated.

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:57.660
You know, he was an inspiration to me in school.

01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:02.660
And I remember even my teachers had qualms about him

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:04.820
because he was a secular person.

01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:06.580
But I loved Ghassan Qanafani.

01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:10.020
He's a beloved figure in the Palestinian community.

01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:13.940
And I hope to one day be able to achieve a fraction

01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:17.500
of what he's achieved in the terms of shaping

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:20.340
a political consciousness for Palestinians

01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:21.700
and for people in the region.

01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:24.540
Did he classify himself as a politician,

01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:26.740
as a philosopher, as an activist?

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:27.580
Do you know?

01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:28.740
He was a writer, but he was also part

01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:33.660
of the Palestine Liberation Front, PFLP.

01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:38.660
So he used the words to fight for freedom.

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:42.460
Yeah, I don't think he would have thought his words

01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:44.860
were divorced from other forms of struggle,

01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:49.500
but I think he recognized the importance of culture

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.980
and shaping culture and shaping public opinion,

01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:57.900
both in achieving a shift in global stance

01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:05.420
and also in achieving an awakening

01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:08.540
in the Palestinian generation as well.

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:12.460
You know, there's a very famous interview of his

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:15.860
where he's talking to, I believe, a British journalist.

01:42:15.860 --> 01:42:17.220
And the British journalist is asking him,

01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:20.940
why don't you have talks with the Israelis?

01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.940
And he means, what do you mean, talks?

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:23.980
You mean capitulation?

01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:26.660
You mean talking that you can't have a conversation

01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:28.180
between the sword and the neck?

01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:34.380
And I think that really summarizes the kind of values

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.420
he stood for.

01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.700
Now to talk about the three things.

01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:41.100
Local reactionary leadership, regimes in the Arab states

01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:44.300
surrounding Palestine, and the imperialist Zionist enemy.

01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:46.100
Yeah, so in today's terms,

01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:49.820
the local reactionary leadership is the Palestinian authority.

01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:54.900
The regional regimes, we're talking about,

01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:58.220
actually, the normalization deals

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:01.900
that have emerged in recent years, the Abrahamic Accords,

01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:05.500
have been talked about as though they're like

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:08.500
groundbreaking new phenomenon.

01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:13.260
But many Arab countries have normalized relations

01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:14.460
with the Israeli regime.

01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:19.460
Since the birth of the state, it's not a new thing.

01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.020
But yes, I think he was talking about Egypt and Jordan

01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:28.620
at the time, today we can include United Arab Emirates,

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:31.100
we can include Bahrain, we can include Morocco.

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:36.980
And these, again, these Abrahamic Accords,

01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:40.260
they are promoted and marketed and talked about

01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:44.660
as some kind of like religious reconciliation,

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:47.260
which I think is the most disgusting thing ever

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:51.140
because they're not about religious reconciliation.

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.660
They're about arms deals and economic deals,

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:57.740
and they're about consolidating power in the region.

01:43:57.740 --> 01:44:00.420
They're about mutual strategic interests

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:02.700
that all of these nations have together.

01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:07.540
And some people argue that Palestine is no longer

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:10.980
an Arab cause because Arab countries are normalizing.

01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:13.180
But most of these governments, if not all,

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.620
actually all these governments that have normalized,

01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:20.020
most of them are monarchies, are not elected governments,

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:24.220
and they do not represent the will of the people

01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:27.580
or the desires or the opinions of their peoples.

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:32.580
And the proof to this is like places like Jordan and Egypt,

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.100
even though they've normalized

01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:35.500
and had peace agreements with Israel

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.780
for many, many, many, many years,

01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:39.300
Palestine and the Palestinian cause

01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:43.180
was still a talking point in the political campaigning

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:46.020
of politicians, Jordanian, Egyptian politicians,

01:44:46.020 --> 01:44:49.700
and continues to be for them to gain popularity

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:52.260
because that's where the hearts of the people are.

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:57.900
And then the Zionist regime is quite explanatory.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.460
The imperial Zionist regime, I mean,

01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:02.140
what else do you call a regime that sought help

01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:06.460
from imperialist powers to depopulate an entire country

01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:08.100
and build a new one on top of it?

01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:12.180
So mostly, you're saying the thing

01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:18.940
that Abraham Accords achieved is a negative thing

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:20.460
for Palestine.

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.980
So these kinds of agreements amongst the powers

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:29.140
about between the leadership is not positive for the region.

01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:33.300
No, no, obviously they're gonna be marketed as positive

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:38.300
and obviously, they're gonna have this flowery language

01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:40.820
surrounding them.

01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:43.460
And the idiots in the room might like nod and smile,

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.660
but anybody with critical thinking skills can know

01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:48.300
that if people continue to be under occupation,

01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:50.940
there's nothing positive there.

01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:53.220
And it's also there's, let's linger a little bit

01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:55.100
on the mutual interests.

01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:58.260
The only way Morocco could normalize relations

01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:03.260
with the Israeli regime is so that the Israeli regime

01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:06.580
could recognize Moroccan sovereignty

01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:09.900
over the Western Sahara, which just happened actually

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:13.020
last week and now Morocco, and before that,

01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:16.900
Morocco recognized Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank.

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:19.500
It's not like Morocco itself just has no interest

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.540
in this kind of deal.

01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:26.820
You mentioned that you hope of accomplishing

01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:29.300
some of the things that Hassan Qadhafani

01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:31.140
was able to accomplish.

01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:35.180
Let me ask you a silly question, perhaps a silly question.

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:37.380
Do you have interest in running for political office

01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:42.380
in to leadership?

01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:47.380
I hear laughter in the room to lead

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:49.100
in a leadership position in Palestine.

01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:51.180
Not currently, no.

01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:52.020
Not at all.

01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:53.260
Let's see if this ages well.

01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:54.100
I don't think, yeah, no.

01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:59.100
I don't think there's a body through which I can run

01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:00.020
for anything.

01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:04.380
It's like, it's completely dysfunctional.

01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:06.900
And also, you know, I don't wanna wear a suit all the time.

01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:07.740
That's...

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:11.300
Who would wanna do that?

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:12.140
Yeah.

01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:16.900
So from which kind of position would you run for political office?

01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:21.980
So from which kind of pedestal or from which kind of stage

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:23.980
do you think you can be most effective?

01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:27.620
You know, I speak, I was born and raised in Jerusalem.

01:47:27.620 --> 01:47:28.540
I speak perfect Arabic.

01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:30.900
I think my Arabic writing is much superior

01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:35.900
to my English writing, but I choose to write in English

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:41.740
because I think there's not, there's a disparity

01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:45.020
and there's a chasm between what is said in Arabic

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:49.500
on the street in Palestine and what is said here

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:54.500
about Palestinians, both by anti-Palestinian racists

01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.740
and people who are pro-Palestine and advocates for Palestine.

01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:01.500
And I believe I and a few others from my generations

01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:03.260
or many others actually from my generation

01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:05.220
are working to fill that chasm.

01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:08.460
And I also believe that literature, culture,

01:48:08.460 --> 01:48:11.220
the public sphere, changing the public opinion,

01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:14.740
changing the narrative is important to affecting policy,

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.380
affecting material change.

01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:19.660
You know, I'm not gonna go read a poem

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:23.620
in front of a checkpoint and watch it catch in flames.

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:26.340
That's not, I'm not that delusional

01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:28.100
about the power of words.

01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:33.100
But I do think that I have a responsibility

01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:36.820
and I have a privilege even to have a voice,

01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:38.660
to have some kind of platform.

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:41.620
And if I'm not defining myself,

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:44.380
if I'm not talking and representing myself,

01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:46.820
then other people will define me.

01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:49.900
And there are definitions of the Palestinian people

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:54.340
across the few past decades have not been kind or generous

01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:55.260
to the Palestinian people.

01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:56.100
That's one thing.

01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:57.860
The other thing is I believe in the United States

01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:01.380
as a front for change.

01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:03.900
I believe we have a lot more leverage here

01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:05.820
than we do back home.

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:10.700
Again, I believe in, someone said the other day,

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:11.540
I can't remember their name,

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:13.700
but someone said no stone unturned.

01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.980
I believe in fighting on all fronts.

01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:18.340
But here really I can go protest

01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:21.340
in front of the Israeli embassy without getting shot.

01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:24.740
There's a lot of work to be done here.

01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:27.060
There's a lot of people waking up.

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:29.620
I would even argue that a reckoning is coming

01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:32.460
in the American public.

01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:35.260
And more and more American people are concerned

01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.540
where their tax money is going

01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:39.420
or concerned what their politicians are invested in.

01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:42.460
More and more American people are saying not on our dime

01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:47.460
or saying not today, not here.

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:54.140
And also there's many Palestinians in the diaspora here

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:58.660
in the United States and Europe who benefit

01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:01.260
and could benefit from political education

01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:04.780
in the English language because of diaspora across history.

01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.500
The Palestinian diaspora has been effective

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.340
in the 70s and the 80s.

01:50:08.340 --> 01:50:11.740
And I'm hoping ever since 2021,

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:14.020
there has been a resurgence of the power

01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:17.060
and influence of the Palestinian diaspora.

01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:18.900
To ask another silly question,

01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:21.500
since you mentioned the United States,

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:22.940
I don't know if you follow the politics

01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:26.180
in the United States, but do you have a preference

01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:30.500
of presidential candidates in the 2024 election?

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:37.460
Or is that, do you follow where each candidate stands

01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:39.180
on the different policies?

01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:40.740
I think everybody in the world should be able

01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:42.820
to vote for American elections actually.

01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:44.580
I do follow.

01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:46.220
Because of the influence they have.

01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:47.060
Yes, yes.

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.620
I do follow, I don't have a preference whatsoever.

01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:58.060
I don't, I saw Cornell West on CNN.

01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:01.180
I don't think, I don't know if he's gonna go far

01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:02.420
with his campaign.

01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:04.500
Cornell West is running with the Green Party

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:07.340
and I don't think he's gonna achieve much success

01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:11.140
but I saw him on CNN berating Anderson Cooper

01:51:11.140 --> 01:51:12.900
and I enjoyed that very much.

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:15.060
Wouldn't mind seeing that on my screen.

01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:15.900
Regularly.

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:20.900
Regularly, but don't really have an opinion about, you know.

01:51:21.380 --> 01:51:23.860
You wrote Rifka, a book of poetry.

01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:24.900
How did that come about?

01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:29.900
Maybe you can tell the story of that book coming to be.

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:34.140
You know, I signed the book when it had a lot,

01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:37.460
a lot less visibility in the world.

01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:41.340
So when I didn't think thousands and thousands

01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:42.700
and thousands of people would be reading it,

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:44.220
I decided to include many poems

01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:45.980
which I wrote when I was young.

01:51:46.980 --> 01:51:49.220
Because it's a long, it's a long,

01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:51.100
it's a long journey, this book.

01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:55.300
It starts in Jerusalem, it goes to Atlanta,

01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:58.540
it goes back to Jerusalem and then it ends in New York.

01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:01.460
And Rifka is the name of my grandmother

01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:03.980
and it's an Arabic name.

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:06.500
And it means to accompany someone.

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:10.500
And I wanted to write about displacement

01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:15.380
in a way that was beyond what we read about in English.

01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:16.340
Poetry as a medium.

01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:19.380
I don't know if I have much faith in it anymore.

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.700
To be honest, maybe like I'm turned off by it

01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:24.140
and I'll revisit it again in a few years.

01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:26.780
But at the time of writing this book,

01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:31.780
poetry as a medium, it really was a source of hope

01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:33.540
and inspiration for me.

01:52:34.620 --> 01:52:38.220
So my mother was a poet and she would,

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.300
her and my dad would play this game in the morning.

01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:43.220
She would read her poems to him

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:47.380
and he would guess which lines would be read penciled

01:52:47.380 --> 01:52:48.620
by the Israeli military censor

01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:49.940
because she would submit her poems

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:52.460
to the local newspaper, Al Quds newspaper.

01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:54.620
And the military censor has to go over it.

01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:58.780
And she would get her poems back

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:01.260
with a bunch of words erased and they would laugh about it

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.940
and poetry was very much part of my upbringing.

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:07.780
And as a Palestinian, when you're excluded

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:11.580
from mainstream spaces, including media and journalism,

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:13.740
poetry tends to be a place where you can say

01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:15.780
what you want to say without repercussions.

01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:19.580
And I say that, I realize that our greatest writer,

01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:26.420
Ghassan Qanafani, literally had his car bombed, exploded,

01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:27.380
because of his writings.

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:30.540
And recently Darin Tartour, a poet,

01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:32.300
Palestinian poet with an Israeli citizenship

01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.180
was imprisoned for a few months

01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:35.420
for publishing a poem on Facebook

01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:38.140
in which he said, resist, my people resist.

01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:39.980
So even that is not necessarily true.

01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:42.900
But anyway, it just felt like I could,

01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:44.020
it's a place where I could talk

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:49.020
and express large ideas in a simplistic way.

01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:52.260
And the best example I could give you

01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.940
is one of my favorite poets, Rashid Hussain.

01:53:55.780 --> 01:54:00.780
When the Israeli authorities decided to do the land law,

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:08.620
which classified, I believe 93% of historic Palestine

01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:14.740
is Israeli owned, state owned, forgive me.

01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:18.740
And then when they also did the absentee property law,

01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:21.700
which allows the Israeli government to take over homes

01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:25.260
that were depopulated from the Palestinian owners,

01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:28.740
he wrote a poem called God is a Refugee.

01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:31.620
It's a kind of a sarcastic, sardonic poem

01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:34.820
in which he goes, God has become a refugee, sir.

01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:38.460
So confiscate even the carpet of the mosque

01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:41.420
and sell the church because it's his property

01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:44.380
and sell our orphans because their father is absent

01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.300
and do whatever you want.

01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:48.060
It's like, it's a sarcastic poem

01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:50.500
that was in reaction to these laws

01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:52.820
that translated to the everyday Palestinian,

01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:54.700
to the farmers, to the land owners,

01:54:54.700 --> 01:54:58.580
what these bureaucratic, complicated laws meant to them,

01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:00.340
what they meant to their land,

01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:05.340
what it meant, what effect are these laws gonna have

01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:07.220
on these people's lands?

01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:09.740
And that, I think, is the role of poetry

01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:12.740
that I try to achieve.

01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:17.740
So poetry ultimately prizes the power of words

01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:22.420
and so the medium, the power of the medium of poetry

01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:25.700
transfers nicely to any medium that celebrates words.

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:30.700
So even, I mean, just writing novels, tweeting.

01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:36.500
You're also working on a new book, a memoir.

01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.340
What's the title?

01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.580
What can you say about it?

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:43.620
Memoir is bizarre because I'm so young,

01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:44.700
so it's not really my memoir,

01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:47.660
but it's rather a memoir of the neighborhood

01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:49.420
which I grew up.

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:51.700
The title, the tentative title is A Million States in One,

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:53.660
and it's a nod to how many different realities

01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.140
and universes exist in this tiny one country.

01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:00.420
And it's kind of a documentation

01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:08.780
of the two waves of expulsion in 2009 and 2020 and 2021,

01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:13.060
and the kind of behind the scenes of the campaign

01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:15.900
that took place, the diplomatic and media campaign

01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:17.540
and grassroots campaign that took place

01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:21.100
to save our homes, and it's also an exploration

01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:26.100
of other communities that are threatened with the expulsion

01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:29.780
and other communities who are resisting in their own way,

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:32.420
be it in Beita, in Nablus or South Harbour Hills

01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:37.420
and in Masafariatta or in Silwan or in the Noqab,

01:56:37.540 --> 01:56:38.940
all these communities that are dealing

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:40.820
with different forms of expulsion.

01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:43.660
And the emphasis that I'm trying to achieve

01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.500
with this book is dignity.

01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:51.420
I want to write a book about my experiences

01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:59.020
that is super dignified, that kind of kicks its feet

01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:02.220
up on the table and says what it wants unabashedly

01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:06.220
because we are told not only are we going to be victimized,

01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:08.780
but we are going to be polite in our suffering.

01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:10.420
And I wanna reject that completely,

01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:12.140
and I want to lean into the humor

01:57:12.140 --> 01:57:14.460
of the past few years of my life,

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:17.300
because I think that's really what the world needs

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:18.860
and what I need to be writing.

01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:22.220
A few questions here, but one of them is about humor.

01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:25.500
In Rifka, you wrote, my mother has always said

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:29.700
the most tragic of disasters is those that cause laughter.

01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:31.420
What do you think she meant by that?

01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:36.100
It's, I don't know if, that's my mom saying,

01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:38.460
but I don't know if it's like probably a proverb

01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:39.620
that I first heard from my mom,

01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:42.220
but it's, sharul baliyati mayut haq,

01:57:42.220 --> 01:57:47.220
like the most evil of atrocity is what makes you laugh.

01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:52.740
And it can be, you know, it's open for interpretation.

01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:55.820
You should be aware of, one school of thought would say

01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:57.940
you should be aware of the things that make you laugh,

01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:01.580
but another school of thought would say this is a commentary

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:05.180
on like our natural reactions to tragedies, right?

01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:08.500
In like 2012, 2011, something like this,

01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:11.420
we had like a protest.

01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:14.940
And after the protest, all of the women

01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.180
of the neighborhood were sitting down

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:19.340
under the fig tree of our neighborhood,

01:58:19.340 --> 01:58:20.700
which they always do.

01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:23.780
And, you know, a bunch of soldiers,

01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:26.420
maybe 40 soldiers started marching down the street

01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:28.980
and everybody dispersed and hid in their homes.

01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:31.580
But my aunt who has now passed away,

01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:33.220
my aunt refused to go home.

01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:35.980
She wanted to gather her teacups

01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:38.180
because she really cared about her teacups.

01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:41.420
So I was begging her to go inside

01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:43.180
and she refused, she was gathering her teacups.

01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:48.180
So a soldier grabbed me and squeezed me

01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:51.580
between his baton and an electricity pole.

01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:54.060
And it was very excruciatingly painful

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:56.260
and traumatizing for me as a child.

01:58:56.260 --> 01:59:00.580
But it was, it's also like a funny memory in a way,

01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:05.100
despite the pain, despite the trauma that came with it.

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.060
There's still something funny about it.

01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:09.060
The absurdity of it.

01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:11.700
Yeah, and it's like, it's dignifying

01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:13.420
to find humor in these kinds of things.

01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:15.820
It makes you realize you are not so weak,

01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:17.380
you are not so powerless.

01:59:17.380 --> 01:59:19.420
Another thing is, you know, my same aunt

01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:23.380
who was like super obsessed with cleanliness would,

01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:30.140
you know, insist on not going to sleep

01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:31.980
before washing the dishes.

01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:33.180
And I would always tease her and say,

01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:34.180
what, you're just gonna like,

01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:35.700
you're gonna give them the house clean?

01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:38.580
Like you can leave it dirty so they have to clean it up.

01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:41.140
And these little things, although like incredibly,

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.900
you know, absurd and telling of a harrowing reality

01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:47.940
that our family and many in the neighborhood were living

01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:52.580
are also the coping mechanisms that we were using

01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:57.380
to deal with our everyday reality.

01:59:57.380 --> 02:00:01.460
And so much in the public framing of Palestinians,

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:03.860
whether it be it in media and novels and diplomacy

02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:07.740
and so on and so forth, is that of the powerless victim?

02:00:07.740 --> 02:00:10.020
Is that of the person who only weeps?

02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:13.060
You know, like Israeli propagandists, for example,

02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:19.140
will like show pictures on Twitter of like a house in Gaza.

02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:22.100
And they'll be like, look, this house has windows.

02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:24.180
Like they're talking about their BCs,

02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:26.820
but they have a nice, they have a balcony on their house.

02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:27.780
What are they talking about?

02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:30.220
Like, you know, or like they'll show a video

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:31.820
of a supermarket in Gaza and they'll be like,

02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:33.340
how come they're talking about a blockade

02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:35.460
when they have a supermarket and blah, blah, blah?

02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:39.580
As though, you know, the ceiling has been so lowered

02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:42.500
that we can't even afford joy anymore

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:45.300
or, you know, a little supermarket in the neighborhood.

02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:49.020
So as a poet, as a writer,

02:00:49.020 --> 02:00:51.740
I've written a book of poetry, but not working on a new book.

02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:56.420
What can you say about your process of crafting words?

02:00:56.420 --> 02:00:58.460
And I think people listening to this can hear

02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:01.940
that there's a poetry the way you speak in English.

02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:06.940
So somebody that cares about the craftsmanship of words

02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:08.940
in both English and Arabic,

02:01:08.940 --> 02:01:10.780
what can you say about your process?

02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:16.020
It's a lot more neat than like this conversation.

02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:18.620
It's like, I am obsessed with sentences

02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:19.660
and it takes me a long time

02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:23.060
to like finish a piece of writing.

02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:24.620
I am a perfectionist.

02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:25.540
Do you edit a lot?

02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:27.940
I edit all the time and I like can't move on

02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:29.620
from one sentence until it's perfect.

02:01:29.620 --> 02:01:32.780
But I will say my other writer friends here in New York

02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:37.780
do not face is how easily disrupted my writing is

02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:41.340
by other notes.

02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:44.020
Yanni, I'll pitch a story to my editor

02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:45.900
about something, for example.

02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:50.180
And then as I'm writing it, 20 minutes in,

02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:52.740
some kid was shot and killed by the Israeli military.

02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:53.820
So you have to say something about it.

02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:56.220
And then 30 minutes later, as I'm writing it,

02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:59.660
there's news about a home demolition in Silwan

02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:04.340
and there is this relentless onslaught of news

02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:07.700
that prevents us and the presence of the ability

02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:11.220
to analyze, to frame, to think, to conceptualize,

02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:14.940
to write beyond the current affairs.

02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:19.060
We're stuck in the relentlessness of the occupation

02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:25.100
that a lot of the time I worry that the things I'm writing

02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:29.060
are always in reaction to a crime that took place,

02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:33.300
to a bombing that took place and so on and so forth.

02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:35.420
And I think that's unfortunately true

02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:37.660
for so many Palestinian writers.

02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:42.420
So, you know, I would say isolation

02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:45.020
and like stepping away from the news

02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:48.820
is very important to do, but I don't do it.

02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:50.660
So, okay.

02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:55.660
So the struggle to find the timeless message in it

02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:58.780
is an ongoing struggle for you.

02:02:58.780 --> 02:03:01.260
I mean, there is the timeless, you know,

02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:02.980
it's not even timelessness, it's timeliness.

02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:04.940
I think what you write is always timely

02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:07.100
because the occupation is ongoing,

02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:09.180
but the struggle is, you know,

02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:13.180
moving beyond the news and tackling more nuances

02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:18.100
because in Arabic I can, in Arabic I can philosophize.

02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:20.220
I can talk about violence

02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:23.420
and I can talk about my complicated relationship

02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:25.820
with violence or like my complicated,

02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:28.340
I can complicate and nuance and give things nuance,

02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:31.340
but in English people still do not believe

02:03:31.340 --> 02:03:32.540
we are under occupation,

02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.620
even though it is an internationally recognized fact

02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:38.180
that is broadcasted 24 seven

02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:41.100
through the world's most watched screens.

02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:45.940
So we're stuck in like a practice of providing facts

02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:47.900
and figure as an actually this happened

02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:50.260
and this person did this

02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.340
and according to international law and blah, blah, blah.

02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:56.220
So we're stuck in this because the basic truths

02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:58.580
about our own existence are denied

02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:02.140
that we don't even have the luxury of, you know,

02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.500
evolving our writing beyond it

02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:05.460
or at least evolving my writing beyond it.

02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:07.740
And this is what I'm trying to do with this new book.

02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:10.940
That's fascinating that in English,

02:04:11.740 --> 02:04:16.260
your brain is more inclined to be,

02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:18.060
to go towards activism,

02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.820
whereas in Arabic you have the luxury

02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:21.740
to be more of a philosopher.

02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:23.700
I wouldn't say activism, I would say journalism.

02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:26.500
I would like just making sure, you know,

02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:28.300
like disrupting the flow of the sentence

02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:33.300
to insert a statistic or insert a historical fact

02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:37.300
that should be implied and should be a household name,

02:04:37.300 --> 02:04:42.220
but it's not, you know, I can't just say the Nakba.

02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:45.340
I have to say the Nakba, the 1948 total,

02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:47.140
near total destruction of Palestinian society

02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:48.300
at the hands of Zionist militias

02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:50.100
that later formed the Israeli military

02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:51.940
that now terrorizes us today.

02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:56.940
And there's like three tier legal system, blah, blah, blah.

02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:58.620
I can't just say the Nakba.

02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:01.340
I have to give all of these explanations.

02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:06.620
And that's heartbreaking and people are out to do better.

02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:11.620
This is not, it's not what my literature

02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:13.860
should be limited to.

02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:16.260
It's not what anybody's literature should be limited to.

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:20.220
It's the job of, it's the job of, you know,

02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:23.140
news reporters to report the news.

02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:26.540
But a lot of the time they use looted language,

02:05:26.540 --> 02:05:30.260
they use passive voice, they confiscate facts,

02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:33.620
and it's on the shoulders of us.

02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:37.700
And it's on the shoulders of us, the heavy carrying.

02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:41.460
Which you say the press in the United States

02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:46.420
does a good or poor job of covering Israel and Palestine.

02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:48.220
Terrible job, horrible job.

02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:49.060
What's the-

02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:49.900
Horrendous job.

02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:51.100
They don't do their job whatsoever.

02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:52.700
What are the biggest failings?

02:05:52.700 --> 02:05:55.740
Not mentioning that a town is occupied

02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:58.140
when you're reporting about an occupied town.

02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:02.380
Not mentioning that a settlement is illegal

02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:05.900
or a settler is illegally present in a Palestinian village

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:07.420
when you're reporting on them.

02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:12.340
Only quoting Israeli officials

02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:15.100
and only quoting Israeli politicians and police officers

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:18.980
and framing your entire analysis with Israeli officials.

02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:20.660
And only interviewing Palestinians

02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:25.660
when they have been brutalized and victimized physically.

02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.180
Yeah, those are some of the issues.

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:28.100
There is plenty.

02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:30.340
And then like saying things, you know,

02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:35.860
Israel will bomb a hospital in Gaza

02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:39.740
and the press will say like Hamas run hospital.

02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:41.900
And this negative association with Hamas

02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:44.660
will remove any sympathy from the reader

02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:47.140
towards the victims of this hospital bombing.

02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:50.940
A lot of things, and a lot of them are sinister.

02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:55.180
I have many friends, many journalist friends,

02:06:55.180 --> 02:06:57.300
and I've seen many journalists online

02:06:57.300 --> 02:07:00.820
speak about their experiences when talking about Palestine,

02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:02.700
the censorship that goes on into it.

02:07:03.820 --> 02:07:05.180
And I have many journalist friends,

02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.100
some at the New York Times,

02:07:07.100 --> 02:07:11.140
some that used to be at the Washington Post

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:14.060
who tell me the kinds of battles they had to do.

02:07:14.060 --> 02:07:15.700
They had to go through with their editors

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:18.780
to let them even utter the word Palestine.

02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:21.300
And not even in like news pieces,

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:25.300
like pieces about let's say a Palestinian artist

02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:27.460
or a Palestinian chef or whatever.

02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:29.820
You know, there's lots of,

02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:32.100
there's a lot that happens behind the scene

02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:33.940
that is not reported on.

02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:35.460
Because when it comes to Palestine,

02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:40.460
the rules and the laws of journalism are bendable.

02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:42.700
You know, passive voice is king,

02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:46.420
emitting facts is acceptable, anything goes.

02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:50.180
So you personally, just psychologically,

02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:54.020
what have been the lowest points in your life,

02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:55.420
the darkest points?

02:07:57.180 --> 02:08:01.420
A recent study came out and said that 52% of Palestinians

02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:02.780
have depression.

02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:05.660
I would argue that the number is much, much, much higher.

02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:08.460
I think it would be absurd for someone to live

02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:11.820
under the conditions we live under and not contemplate

02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:17.140
many things, many things, not just suicide,

02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:18.460
but many, many, many things.

02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:21.940
And if people were to put themselves in our shoes

02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:24.180
for just one day, they would understand

02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:28.860
where all of the rage and all the resistance

02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:29.820
is coming from.

02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:32.700
It's not an easy life.

02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:34.740
So where do you find the strength?

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:36.620
I'm surrounded by good people.

02:08:36.620 --> 02:08:41.420
And I'm surrounded by good people

02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:43.060
and I don't even think of it as a strength.

02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:44.460
I think of this as my obligation.

02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:46.700
It just feels like the thing I have to do.

02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:49.140
It's not, I don't need inspiration.

02:08:49.140 --> 02:08:50.140
I don't need strength.

02:08:50.140 --> 02:08:54.260
I don't need, it's just my obligation.

02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:58.380
It's just, there is a great travesty

02:08:58.380 --> 02:08:59.820
taking place in the world.

02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:06.940
And I and few others have been put in a place

02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:11.260
where we're able to talk about it to a few more people.

02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:13.100
And it's just my obligation.

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:14.460
I have to do it.

02:09:14.460 --> 02:09:17.860
What gives you hope about the future of Palestine?

02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:20.420
What gives me hope about the future of Palestine

02:09:20.420 --> 02:09:23.780
is taking a look at history and understanding

02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:26.420
that across history, there has not been an injustice

02:09:26.420 --> 02:09:30.180
that lingered endlessly.

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:33.140
Everything comes to an end.

02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:34.740
It's not necessarily, there's not necessarily

02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:37.740
like a perfect resolution for everything,

02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:42.740
but nothing continues in the form that it started

02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:47.460
in the occupation and colonialism in Palestine and Zionism.

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:51.340
All of these things are not at all sustainable whatsoever.

02:09:51.340 --> 02:09:52.740
So taking a look at history,

02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:55.020
a lot of what I'm saying today

02:09:55.020 --> 02:09:56.500
and what I have said in your podcast,

02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:59.500
many people would be pearl clutching

02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:01.300
hearing me say what I say.

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:03.260
But I always try to remind myself

02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:06.660
that during Jim Crow, during slavery, during the Holocaust,

02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:10.940
during the occupation of Algeria,

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:16.500
during any point of colonialism

02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:17.980
in the African continent,

02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:22.380
people did not possess the moral clarity they possess today

02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:23.700
when they talk about these things.

02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:27.260
And all of these things were contested and controversial

02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:29.780
and in many, many, many cases legal.

02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:32.020
And today they are deplorable, condemnable,

02:10:32.020 --> 02:10:34.580
and people say never again and they don't remember them.

02:10:34.580 --> 02:10:36.340
So that's what gives me hope,

02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:38.220
is believing in the, you know,

02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:43.100
believing in the inevitability of justice.

02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:46.100
What do you love most about Palestine?

02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:48.460
What are like maybe little things

02:10:48.460 --> 02:10:50.020
that you remember from your childhood,

02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:53.940
from your life there in each Jerusalem and elsewhere

02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:57.020
that you just brings a smile to your face?

02:10:57.980 --> 02:11:02.980
I think just the unabashedness of Palestinians.

02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:07.220
Where people who are told and at some point

02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:09.860
we're told by the large majority of the world

02:11:09.860 --> 02:11:11.020
that we should shrink ourselves,

02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:12.500
that we should be ashamed of who we are,

02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:14.020
that we are monsters, that we are terrorists,

02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:15.620
that we are blah, blah, blah.

02:11:16.660 --> 02:11:19.340
And Palestinian people don't really give a shit.

02:11:19.340 --> 02:11:21.300
You know, they're continuing to live as they do.

02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:23.260
They continue to resist, they continue to write,

02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:26.300
they continue to do all that they do

02:11:26.300 --> 02:11:28.060
and they love that the most.

02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:32.100
And they love our ability to laugh more than anything else.

02:11:32.100 --> 02:11:36.940
One thing that's misunderstood in American culture

02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:39.540
about Palestinian culture or just Western culture in general

02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:41.220
is like martyrdom culture.

02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:47.100
A lot of the time people will broadcast images

02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:51.660
of Palestinian women cheering

02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:56.660
when their sons have been killed by Israeli forces

02:11:57.180 --> 02:12:00.060
and they all say, you know, these people glorify death

02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:02.540
and these people are eager to like have sex

02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:05.620
with 70 virgins in heaven and so on and so forth.

02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:07.140
But that's not the case.

02:12:07.140 --> 02:12:09.580
The whole idea of the occupation

02:12:09.580 --> 02:12:10.780
when they are killing our children,

02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:13.700
the whole idea is that they're trying to break our spirits.

02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:17.620
So these mothers whose hearts are broken, who are anguished,

02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:21.420
who are, you know, so,

02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:27.460
so in so much pain, when they are cheering,

02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:30.380
they are not celebrating, they're not cheering.

02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:31.980
They are letting the occupier know

02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:34.380
that you have not broken my spirit.

02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:36.700
I have not yet been defeated.

02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.060
And I think that is beautiful.

02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:40.580
It's the same thing with our prison culture.

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.820
You know, Palestinians are fascinating

02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:45.300
in the sense that Palestinians go to prison

02:12:45.300 --> 02:12:48.420
and they study and they come out with degrees.

02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:53.020
They can find ways to participate in civil society.

02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:56.020
They can even smuggle, you know, sperm from prison

02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:58.420
to give a life outside of it

02:12:58.420 --> 02:13:01.300
because they understand in their philosophy of prisons,

02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:04.260
they understand that these structures, these buildings

02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:06.580
were built to break your spirits.

02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:07.500
So what do you do?

02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:10.460
You allow it, you don't allow it to break your spirits.

02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:12.140
You resist it.

02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:14.340
You continue to hold on to life.

02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:16.740
You continue to hold on to your love of life.

02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:19.900
You continue to hold on to your love of freedom.

02:13:19.900 --> 02:13:20.980
And you come out of prison

02:13:20.980 --> 02:13:22.980
and you're celebrated by your community.

02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:26.300
And the prison has not broken your spirit.

02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:29.140
So all of these structures and system

02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:31.820
that the Zionist movement has put into place,

02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:34.020
be it the shoot to kill policies or the prisons

02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:35.700
or the demolishing our homes

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:40.100
that were meant to kill our spirits, they don't.

02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:42.540
You demolish the home in Jerusalem

02:13:42.540 --> 02:13:45.140
and the people say, don't worry, we'll build another.

02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:47.020
And you demolish it and we'll build another.

02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:49.060
That's what I admire most about the Palestinian people.

02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:50.580
It's this resilience.

02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:52.260
And, you know, people love to say resilience,

02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:53.300
but I think it's stubbornness.

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.700
I think we're such a stubborn people

02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:56.140
and I think that's great.

02:13:57.020 --> 02:14:00.900
Well, Muhammad, thank you for being a man

02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:03.900
who exemplifies this unbreakable spirit.

02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:07.100
Thank you for the words you've written,

02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:09.620
the words you've spoken, and thank you for talking today.

02:14:09.620 --> 02:14:12.980
This is an honor and thank you for educating me.

02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:14.700
Thank you so much.

02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:16.100
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:17.580

02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:25.300
from Nelson Mandela.

02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:29.580
It always seems impossible until it's done.

02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:33.660
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

02:14:39.620 --> 02:14:40.460
