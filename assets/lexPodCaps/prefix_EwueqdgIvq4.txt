00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
The following is a conversation with Jeff Schoenlein,

00:03.080 --> 00:05.120
a scientist at NIST interested

00:05.120 --> 00:08.440
in optoelectronic intelligence.

00:08.440 --> 00:12.160
We have a deep technical dive into computing hardware

00:12.160 --> 00:14.080
that will make Jim Keller proud.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.440
I urge you to hop on to this roller coaster ride

00:17.440 --> 00:19.320
through neuromorphic computing

00:19.320 --> 00:24.320
and superconducting electronics and hold on for dear life.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.160
Jeff is a great communicator of technical information.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.200
And so it was truly a pleasure to talk to him

00:30.200 --> 00:32.360
about some physics and engineering.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.480
To support this podcast,

00:34.480 --> 00:37.480
please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.920
This is the Lex Fridman podcast

00:39.920 --> 00:43.420
and here is my conversation with Jeff Schoenlein.

00:44.420 --> 00:48.960
I got a chance to read a fascinating paper you authored

00:48.960 --> 00:52.080
called Optoelectronic Intelligence.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.220
So maybe we can start by talking about this paper

00:55.220 --> 00:57.100
and start with the basic questions.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.420
What is optoelectronic intelligence?

01:00.420 --> 01:02.060
Yeah, so in that paper,

01:02.060 --> 01:04.300
the concept I was trying to describe

01:04.300 --> 01:06.700
is sort of an architecture

01:06.700 --> 01:10.860
for building brain-inspired computing

01:10.860 --> 01:13.420
that leverages light for communication

01:13.420 --> 01:17.700
in conjunction with electronic circuits for computation.

01:17.700 --> 01:18.980
In that particular paper,

01:18.980 --> 01:20.920
a lot of the work we're doing right now

01:20.920 --> 01:23.180
in our project at NIST is focused

01:23.180 --> 01:25.820
on superconducting electronics for computation.

01:25.820 --> 01:27.740
I'll go into why that is,

01:27.740 --> 01:31.420
but that might make a little more sense in context

01:31.420 --> 01:35.420
if we first describe what that is in contrast to,

01:35.420 --> 01:37.860
which is semiconducting electronics.

01:37.860 --> 01:39.720
So is it worth taking a couple minutes

01:39.720 --> 01:42.820
to describe semiconducting electronics?

01:42.820 --> 01:45.940
It might even be worthwhile to step back

01:45.940 --> 01:49.960
and talk about electricity and circuits

01:49.960 --> 01:52.260
and how circuits work

01:52.300 --> 01:54.800
before we talk about superconductivity.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.640
Right, okay.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.100
How does a computer work, Jeff?

01:58.100 --> 01:59.820
Well, I won't go into everything

01:59.820 --> 02:01.140
that makes a computer work,

02:01.140 --> 02:05.220
but let's talk about the basic building blocks,

02:05.220 --> 02:08.500
a transistor, and even more basic than that,

02:08.500 --> 02:11.540
a semiconductor material, silicon, say.

02:11.540 --> 02:15.500
So in silicon, silicon is a semiconductor,

02:15.500 --> 02:18.500
and what that means is at low temperature,

02:18.500 --> 02:21.980
there are no free charges, no free electrons

02:21.980 --> 02:22.900
that can move around.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.980
So when you talk about electricity,

02:24.980 --> 02:28.100
you're talking about predominantly electrons

02:28.100 --> 02:30.820
moving to establish electrical currents

02:30.820 --> 02:33.100
and they move under the influence of voltages.

02:33.100 --> 02:36.660
So you apply voltages, electrons move around,

02:36.660 --> 02:38.460
those can be measured as currents,

02:38.460 --> 02:40.940
and you can represent information in that way.

02:40.940 --> 02:43.880
So semiconductors are special

02:43.880 --> 02:46.900
in the sense that they are really malleable.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.220
So if you have a semiconductor material,

02:50.100 --> 02:52.600
you can change the number of free electrons

02:52.600 --> 02:56.020
that can move around by putting different elements,

02:56.020 --> 02:58.300
different atoms in lattice sites.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.220
So what is a lattice site?

03:00.220 --> 03:02.220
Well, a semiconductor is a crystal,

03:02.220 --> 03:06.500
which means all the atoms that comprise the material

03:06.500 --> 03:09.020
are at exact locations

03:09.020 --> 03:10.860
that are perfectly periodic in space.

03:10.860 --> 03:12.220
So if you started any one atom

03:12.220 --> 03:14.660
and you go along what are called the lattice vectors,

03:14.660 --> 03:17.320
you get to another atom and another atom and another atom,

03:17.320 --> 03:19.440
and for high quality devices,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.920
it's important that that is a perfect crystal

03:21.920 --> 03:23.820
with very few defects,

03:23.820 --> 03:27.440
but you can intentionally replace a silicon atom

03:27.440 --> 03:29.240
with say a phosphorus atom,

03:29.240 --> 03:32.160
and then you can change the number of free electrons

03:32.160 --> 03:34.000
that are in a region of space

03:34.000 --> 03:37.140
that has that excess of what are called dopants.

03:37.140 --> 03:40.260
So picture a device that has a left terminal

03:40.260 --> 03:42.040
and a right terminal,

03:42.040 --> 03:44.160
and if you apply a voltage between those two,

03:44.240 --> 03:47.800
you can cause electrical current to flow between them.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.160
Now we add a third terminal up on top there,

03:52.160 --> 03:53.840
and depending on the voltage

03:53.840 --> 03:57.200
between the left and right terminal and that third voltage,

03:57.200 --> 03:58.760
you can change that current.

03:58.760 --> 04:02.320
So what's commonly done in digital electronic circuits

04:02.320 --> 04:06.600
is to leave a fixed voltage from left to right

04:06.600 --> 04:08.640
and then change that voltage

04:08.640 --> 04:10.040
that's applied at what's called the gate,

04:10.040 --> 04:11.240
the gate of the transistor.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.820
So what you do is you make it

04:13.820 --> 04:15.740
to where there's an excess of electrons on the left,

04:15.740 --> 04:17.380
excess of electrons on the right,

04:17.380 --> 04:18.920
and very few electrons in the middle,

04:18.920 --> 04:21.540
and you do this by changing the concentration

04:21.540 --> 04:24.860
of different dopants in the lattice spatially.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.940
And then when you apply a voltage to that gate,

04:27.940 --> 04:30.720
you can either cause current to flow or turn it off,

04:30.720 --> 04:33.460
and so that's sort of your zero and one.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.420
If you apply voltage, current can flow,

04:35.420 --> 04:38.420
that current is representing a digital one,

04:38.420 --> 04:42.000
and from that, from that basic element,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.240
you can build up all the complexity

04:44.240 --> 04:45.560
of digital electronic circuits

04:45.560 --> 04:50.120
that have really had a profound influence on our society.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.640
Now you're talking about electrons.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.720
Can you give a sense of what scale we're talking about

04:54.720 --> 04:56.560
when we're talking about in silicon

04:57.640 --> 05:01.600
being able to mass manufacture these kinds of gates?

05:01.600 --> 05:04.520
Yeah, so scale in a number of different senses.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.560
Well, at the scale of the silicon lattice,

05:07.560 --> 05:10.900
the distance between two atoms there is half a nanometer.

05:10.900 --> 05:14.500
So people often like to compare these things

05:14.500 --> 05:16.580
to the width of a human hair.

05:16.580 --> 05:20.060
I think it's some six orders of magnitude smaller

05:20.060 --> 05:24.460
than the width of a human hair, something on that order.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.880
So remarkably small,

05:25.880 --> 05:27.340
we're talking about individual atoms here,

05:27.340 --> 05:29.540
and electrons are of that length scale

05:29.540 --> 05:31.580
when they're in that environment.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.440
But there's another sense that scale matters

05:33.440 --> 05:34.420
in digital electronics.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.500
This is perhaps the more important sense,

05:36.500 --> 05:37.900
although they're related.

05:37.900 --> 05:41.380
Scale refers to a number of things.

05:41.380 --> 05:44.600
It refers to the size of that transistor.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.340
So for example, I said you have a left contact,

05:47.340 --> 05:49.860
a right contact, and some space between them

05:49.860 --> 05:52.260
where the gate electrode sits.

05:52.260 --> 05:56.020
That's called the channel width or the channel length.

05:56.020 --> 06:00.140
And what has enabled what we think of as Moore's law

06:00.140 --> 06:03.080
or the continued increased performance

06:03.080 --> 06:05.580
in silicon microelectronic circuits

06:05.580 --> 06:07.980
is the ability to make that size,

06:07.980 --> 06:10.500
that feature size ever smaller, ever smaller,

06:10.500 --> 06:14.820
at a really remarkable pace.

06:14.820 --> 06:19.820
I mean, that feature size has decreased consistently

06:20.200 --> 06:23.780
every couple of years since the 1960s.

06:23.780 --> 06:27.180
And that was what Moore predicted in the 1960s.

06:27.180 --> 06:29.500
He thought it would continue for at least two more decades,

06:29.500 --> 06:30.860
and it's been much longer than that.

06:30.860 --> 06:34.860
And so that is why we've been able to fit

06:34.900 --> 06:37.060
ever more devices, ever more transistors,

06:37.060 --> 06:39.220
ever more computational power

06:39.220 --> 06:41.660
on essentially the same size of chip.

06:41.660 --> 06:44.620
So a user sits back and does essentially nothing.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.180
You're running the same computer program,

06:46.180 --> 06:48.580
but those devices are getting smaller, so they get faster,

06:48.580 --> 06:50.320
they get more energy efficient,

06:50.320 --> 06:51.740
and all of our computing performance

06:51.740 --> 06:53.460
just continues to improve.

06:53.460 --> 06:56.440
And we don't have to think too hard

06:56.440 --> 07:00.340
about what we're doing as, say, a software designer,

07:00.340 --> 07:01.180
something like that.

07:01.180 --> 07:02.420
I absolutely don't mean to say

07:02.420 --> 07:05.260
that there's no innovation in software,

07:05.260 --> 07:06.420
or the user side of things.

07:06.420 --> 07:09.580
Of course there is, but from the hardware perspective,

07:09.580 --> 07:12.460
we just have been given this gift

07:12.460 --> 07:16.180
of continued performance improvement through this scaling

07:16.180 --> 07:19.300
that is ever smaller feature sizes

07:19.300 --> 07:22.900
with very similar, say, power consumption.

07:22.900 --> 07:26.100
That power consumption has not continued to scale

07:26.100 --> 07:27.500
in the most recent decades,

07:27.500 --> 07:31.420
but nevertheless, we had a really good run there for a while.

07:31.420 --> 07:34.340
Now we're down to gates that are seven nanometers,

07:34.340 --> 07:36.260
which is state of the art right now.

07:36.260 --> 07:38.920
Maybe Global Foundries is trying to push it

07:38.920 --> 07:39.760
even lower than that.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.580
I can't keep up with where the predictions are

07:42.580 --> 07:43.420
that it's gonna end.

07:43.420 --> 07:47.620
But seven nanometer transistor

07:47.620 --> 07:50.080
has just a few tens of atoms

07:50.080 --> 07:51.900
along the length of the conduction pathway.

07:51.900 --> 07:56.900
So a naive semiconductor device physicist would think

07:57.100 --> 07:58.740
you can't go much further than that

07:58.740 --> 08:01.060
without some kind of revolution

08:01.060 --> 08:03.980
in the way we think about the physics of our devices.

08:03.980 --> 08:07.460
Is there something to be said about the mass manufacture

08:07.460 --> 08:08.300
of these devices?

08:08.300 --> 08:09.500
Right, right, so that's another thing.

08:09.500 --> 08:13.100
So how have we been able to make those transistors

08:13.100 --> 08:14.020
smaller and smaller?

08:14.020 --> 08:17.900
Well, companies like Intel, Global Foundries,

08:17.900 --> 08:20.460
they invest a lot of money in the lithography.

08:20.460 --> 08:22.980
So how are these chips actually made?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.500
Well, one of the most important steps

08:24.500 --> 08:27.840
is this what's called ion implantation.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.120
So you start with sort of a pristine silicon crystal

08:32.120 --> 08:34.240
and then using photolithography,

08:34.240 --> 08:36.640
which is a technique where you can pattern

08:36.640 --> 08:38.960
different shapes using light,

08:38.960 --> 08:41.560
you can define which regions of space

08:41.560 --> 08:45.780
you're going to implant with different species of ions

08:45.780 --> 08:46.760
that are going to change

08:46.760 --> 08:49.700
the local electrical properties right there.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.840
So by using ever shorter wavelengths of light

08:52.840 --> 08:54.540
and different kinds of optical techniques

08:54.540 --> 08:56.760
and different kinds of lithographic techniques,

08:56.760 --> 09:01.160
things that go far beyond my knowledge base,

09:01.160 --> 09:03.520
you can just simply shrink that feature size down.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.880
And you say you're at seven nanometers.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.440
Well, the wavelength of light that's being used

09:07.440 --> 09:08.800
is over 100 nanometers.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.280
That's already deep in the UV.

09:10.280 --> 09:14.760
So how are those minute features patterned?

09:14.760 --> 09:16.960
Well, there's an extraordinary amount of innovation

09:16.960 --> 09:18.240
that has gone into that.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.320
But nevertheless, it stayed very consistent

09:20.320 --> 09:21.940
in this ever shrinking feature size.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.800
And now the question is, can you make it smaller?

09:24.800 --> 09:25.960
And even if you do,

09:25.960 --> 09:28.360
do you still continue to get performance improvements?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.280
But that's another kind of scaling

09:30.280 --> 09:34.320
where these companies have been able to...

09:34.320 --> 09:37.080
So, okay, you picture a chip that has a processor on it.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.820
Well, that chip is not made as a chip.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.920
It's made on a wafer.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.400
And using photolithography,

09:43.400 --> 09:46.200
you basically print the same pattern

09:46.200 --> 09:48.360
on different dyes all across the wafer,

09:48.360 --> 09:53.360
multiple layers, probably 100 some layers

09:53.400 --> 09:55.280
in a mature foundry process.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.640
And you do this on ever bigger wafers too.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.080
That's another aspect of scaling

09:59.080 --> 10:00.960
that's occurred in the last several decades.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.040
So now you have this 300 millimeter wafer.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.360
It's like as big as a pizza

10:04.360 --> 10:06.600
and it has maybe a thousand processors on it.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.960
And then you dice that up using a saw.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.840
And now you can sell these things so cheap

10:11.840 --> 10:15.240
because the manufacturing process was so streamlined.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.480
I think a technology as revolutionary

10:17.480 --> 10:19.400
as silicon microelectronics

10:19.400 --> 10:23.800
has to have that kind of manufacturing scalability,

10:23.800 --> 10:25.760
which I will just emphasize,

10:25.760 --> 10:29.240
I believe is enabled by physics.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.800
It's not, I mean, of course there's human ingenuity

10:31.800 --> 10:36.160
that goes into it, but at least from my side where I sit,

10:36.160 --> 10:39.080
it sure looks like the physics of our universe

10:39.080 --> 10:41.200
allows us to produce that.

10:41.200 --> 10:46.000
And we've discovered how more so than we've invented it.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.480
Although of course we have invented it.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.760
Humans have invented it,

10:49.600 --> 10:51.240
it's almost as if it was there

10:51.240 --> 10:53.240
waiting for us to discover it.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.440
You mean the entirety of it,

10:54.440 --> 10:56.160
or are you specifically talking about

10:56.160 --> 10:58.600
the techniques of photolithography,

10:58.600 --> 10:59.960
like the optics involved?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.840
I mean, the entirety of the scaling down

11:02.840 --> 11:04.600
to the seven nanometers,

11:04.600 --> 11:07.440
you're able to have electrons

11:07.440 --> 11:09.000
not interfere with each other in such a way

11:09.000 --> 11:11.560
that you could still have gates.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.600
Like that's enabled.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.840
To achieve that scale, spatial and temporal,

11:16.840 --> 11:18.720
it seems to be very special

11:18.720 --> 11:21.480
and is enabled by the physics of our world.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.760
All of the things you just said.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.960
So starting with the silicon material itself,

11:25.960 --> 11:28.760
silicon is a unique semiconductor.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.560
It has essentially ideal properties

11:31.560 --> 11:33.720
for making a specific kind of transistor

11:33.720 --> 11:35.200
that's extraordinarily useful.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.560
So I mentioned that silicon has,

11:39.560 --> 11:40.640
well, when you make a transistor,

11:40.640 --> 11:42.000
you have this gate contact

11:42.000 --> 11:44.520
that sits on top of the conduction channel.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.760
And depending on the voltage you apply,

11:47.680 --> 11:50.040
you pull more carriers into the conduction channel

11:50.040 --> 11:53.080
or push them away so it becomes more or less conductive.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.720
In order to have that work

11:54.720 --> 11:56.040
without just sucking those carriers

11:56.040 --> 11:57.160
right into that contact,

11:57.160 --> 11:59.080
you need a very thin insulator.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.240
And part of scaling has been to gradually decrease

12:03.240 --> 12:06.080
the thickness of that gate insulator

12:06.080 --> 12:09.080
so they can use a roughly similar voltage

12:09.080 --> 12:12.120
and still have the same current voltage characteristics.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.640
So the material that's used to do that,

12:14.800 --> 12:16.880
I should say was initially used to do that,

12:16.880 --> 12:18.720
was silicon dioxide,

12:18.720 --> 12:21.800
which just naturally grows on the silicon surface.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.080
So you expose silicon to the atmosphere that we breathe.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.560
And well, if you're manufacturing,

12:27.560 --> 12:29.720
you're gonna purify these gases.

12:29.720 --> 12:32.480
But nevertheless, that what's called a native oxide

12:32.480 --> 12:33.520
will grow there.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.040
There are essentially no other materials

12:36.040 --> 12:37.480
on the entire periodic table

12:37.480 --> 12:41.880
that have as good of a gate insulator

12:41.880 --> 12:43.680
as that silicon dioxide.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.280
That has to do with nothing but the physics

12:46.280 --> 12:49.240
of the interaction between silicon and oxygen.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.240
And if it wasn't that way,

12:51.240 --> 12:54.720
transistors, they could not perform

12:54.720 --> 12:58.760
in nearly the degree of capability that they have.

12:58.760 --> 13:02.880
And that has to do with the way that the oxide grows,

13:02.880 --> 13:05.760
the reduced density of defects there,

13:05.760 --> 13:08.600
it's insulation, meaning essentially it's energy gaps.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.320
You can apply a very large voltage there

13:10.320 --> 13:12.280
without having current leak through it.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.520
So that's physics right there.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.880
There are other things too.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.840
Silicon is a semiconductor in an elemental sense.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.560
You only need silicon atoms.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.840
A lot of other semiconductors,

13:22.840 --> 13:24.880
you need two different kinds of atoms,

13:24.880 --> 13:26.800
like a compound from group three

13:26.800 --> 13:28.560
and a compound from group five.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.680
That opens you up to lots of defects that can occur

13:31.680 --> 13:34.640
where one atom's not sitting quite at the lattice site it is

13:34.640 --> 13:35.960
and it's switched with another one

13:35.960 --> 13:38.280
that degrades performance.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.280
But then also on the side that you mentioned

13:40.280 --> 13:42.080
with the manufacturing,

13:43.520 --> 13:45.840
we have access to light sources

13:45.840 --> 13:48.600
that can produce these very short wavelengths of light.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.920
How does photolithography occur?

13:50.920 --> 13:54.480
Well, you actually put this polymer on top of your wafer

13:54.480 --> 13:56.240
and you expose it to light.

13:56.240 --> 14:00.120
And then you use aqueous chemical processing

14:00.120 --> 14:03.480
to dissolve away the regions that were exposed to light

14:03.480 --> 14:06.000
and leave the regions that were not.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.600
And we are blessed with these polymers

14:08.600 --> 14:09.720
that have the right property

14:09.720 --> 14:13.640
where they can cause scission events

14:13.640 --> 14:16.240
where the polymer splits where a photon hits.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.800
I mean, you know, maybe that's not too surprising,

14:19.800 --> 14:20.640
but I don't know.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.280
It all comes together to have this really complex

14:24.280 --> 14:26.200
manufacturable ecosystem

14:26.200 --> 14:30.640
where very sophisticated technologies can be devised

14:30.640 --> 14:33.080
and it works quite well.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.480
And amazingly, like you said,

14:34.480 --> 14:36.320
with a wavelength at like 100 nanometers

14:36.320 --> 14:37.160
or something like that,

14:37.160 --> 14:39.800
you're still able to achieve on this polymer

14:39.800 --> 14:43.560
precision of whatever we said, seven nanometers.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.840
I think I've heard like four nanometers

14:45.840 --> 14:48.480
being talked about, something like that.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.920
If we could just pause on this

14:49.920 --> 14:52.200
and we'll return to superconductivity,

14:52.200 --> 14:56.440
but in this whole journey from a history perspective,

14:56.440 --> 14:58.480
what do you think is the most beautiful

14:59.520 --> 15:01.800
at the intersection of engineering and physics

15:01.800 --> 15:03.320
to you in this whole process

15:03.320 --> 15:06.600
that we talked about with silicon and photolithography,

15:06.960 --> 15:08.360
and the things that people were able to achieve

15:08.360 --> 15:12.320
in order to push Moore's law forward?

15:12.320 --> 15:13.720
Is it the early days,

15:13.720 --> 15:16.320
the invention of the transistor itself?

15:16.320 --> 15:19.360
Is it some particular cool little thing

15:19.360 --> 15:22.040
that maybe not many people know about?

15:22.040 --> 15:24.560
Like, what do you think is most beautiful

15:24.560 --> 15:26.840
in this whole process, journey?

15:26.840 --> 15:30.120
The most beautiful is a little difficult to answer.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.080
Let me try and sidestep it a little bit

15:32.080 --> 15:34.800
and just say what strikes me

15:34.800 --> 15:39.800
about looking at the history of silicon microelectronics

15:40.200 --> 15:44.600
is that, so when quantum mechanics was developed,

15:44.600 --> 15:47.480
people quickly began applying it to semiconductors,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.360
and it was broadly understood

15:49.360 --> 15:50.800
that these are fascinating systems

15:50.800 --> 15:52.760
and people cared about them for their basic physics,

15:52.760 --> 15:55.080
but also their utility as devices,

15:55.080 --> 15:59.320
and then the transistor was invented in the late 40s

15:59.320 --> 16:02.080
in a relatively crude experimental setup

16:02.080 --> 16:04.280
where you just crammed a metal electrode

16:04.280 --> 16:08.040
into the semiconductor, and that was ingenious.

16:08.040 --> 16:13.040
These people were able to make it work, you know?

16:13.040 --> 16:16.840
But so what I wanna get to that really strikes me

16:16.840 --> 16:19.640
is that in those early days,

16:19.640 --> 16:21.200
there were a number of different semiconductors

16:21.200 --> 16:22.120
that were being considered.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.840
They had different properties, different strengths,

16:23.840 --> 16:24.920
different weaknesses.

16:24.920 --> 16:28.480
Most people thought germanium was the way to go.

16:28.480 --> 16:33.480
It had some nice properties related to things

16:33.680 --> 16:37.320
about how the electrons move inside the lattice,

16:37.320 --> 16:39.800
but other people thought that compound semiconductors

16:39.800 --> 16:41.080
with group three and group five

16:41.080 --> 16:46.200
also had really, really extraordinary properties

16:46.200 --> 16:50.080
that might be conducive to making the best devices.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.560
So there were different groups exploring each of these,

16:52.560 --> 16:54.240
and that's great, that's how science works.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.160
You have to cast a broad net.

16:56.160 --> 17:01.160
But then what I find striking is why is it that silicon won?

17:02.120 --> 17:05.280
Because it's not that germanium is a useless material

17:05.280 --> 17:06.760
and it's not present in technology

17:06.760 --> 17:08.080
or compound semiconductors.

17:08.080 --> 17:12.640
They're both doing exciting and important things,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.400
slightly more niche applications,

17:14.400 --> 17:18.080
whereas silicon is the semiconductor material

17:18.080 --> 17:19.080
for microelectronics,

17:19.080 --> 17:21.000
which is the platform for digital computing,

17:21.000 --> 17:22.760
which has transformed our world.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.200
Why did silicon win?

17:24.200 --> 17:28.760
It's because of a remarkable assemblage of qualities

17:28.760 --> 17:32.120
that no one of them was the clear winner,

17:32.120 --> 17:34.560
but it made these sort of compromises

17:34.560 --> 17:36.680
between a number of different influences.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.520
It had that really excellent gate oxide

17:40.520 --> 17:43.240
that allowed us to make MOSFETs,

17:43.240 --> 17:45.400
these high-performance transistors,

17:45.400 --> 17:47.160
so quickly and cheaply and easily

17:47.160 --> 17:49.560
without having to do a lot of materials development.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.400
The band gap of silicon is actually...

17:53.400 --> 17:56.240
So in a semiconductor, there's an important parameter

17:56.240 --> 17:57.440
which is called the band gap,

17:57.440 --> 18:00.560
which tells you there are sort of electrons

18:00.560 --> 18:04.560
that fill up to one level in the energy diagram.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.760
And then there's a gap where electrons aren't allowed

18:06.760 --> 18:08.240
to have an energy in a certain range.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.280
And then there's another energy level above that.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.920
And that difference between the lower sort of filled level

18:14.920 --> 18:16.880
and the unoccupied level,

18:16.880 --> 18:19.600
that tells you how much voltage you have to apply

18:19.600 --> 18:22.120
in order to induce a current to flow.

18:22.120 --> 18:27.120
So with germanium, that's about 0.75 electron volts.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.600
That means you have to apply 0.75 volts

18:29.600 --> 18:31.960
to get a current moving.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.240
And it turns out that if you compare that

18:34.240 --> 18:38.480
to the thermal excitations that are induced

18:38.480 --> 18:40.640
just by the temperature of our environment,

18:40.640 --> 18:42.080
that gap's not quite big enough.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.080
You start to use it to perform computations,

18:45.080 --> 18:45.920
it gets a little hot,

18:45.920 --> 18:48.120
and you get all these accidental carriers

18:48.120 --> 18:50.720
that are excited into the conduction band,

18:50.720 --> 18:53.360
and it causes errors in your computation.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.240
Silicon's band gap is just a little higher,

18:56.240 --> 18:58.960
1.1 electron volts,

18:58.960 --> 19:01.280
but you have an exponential dependence

19:01.280 --> 19:04.240
on the number of carriers that are present

19:04.240 --> 19:06.640
that can induce those errors.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.480
It decays exponentially with that voltage.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.760
So just that slight extra energy in that band gap

19:12.760 --> 19:15.200
really puts it in an ideal position

19:15.200 --> 19:20.200
to be operated in the conditions of our ambient environment.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.840
It's kind of fascinating that,

19:21.840 --> 19:26.480
like you mentioned, errors decrease exponentially

19:26.480 --> 19:27.520
with the voltage.

19:27.520 --> 19:32.040
So it's funny, because this error thing comes up

19:32.040 --> 19:34.600
when you start talking about quantum computing,

19:34.600 --> 19:36.040
and it's kind of amazing that everything

19:36.040 --> 19:39.480
we've been talking about, the errors as we scale down,

19:39.480 --> 19:41.480
seems to be extremely low.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.320
Yes.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.400
And like all of our computation

19:45.400 --> 19:47.720
is based on the assumption that it's extremely low.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.560
Yes.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.560
Well, it's digital computation.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.480
Sorry, digital computation.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.280
So as opposed to our biological computation,

19:54.280 --> 19:57.200
our brain is like, the assumption is

19:57.200 --> 19:59.120
stuff is gonna fail all over the place,

19:59.120 --> 20:01.720
and we somehow have to still be robust to that.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.080
That's exactly right.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.560
So this also, this is gonna be the most controversial

20:05.560 --> 20:06.600
part of our conversation,

20:06.600 --> 20:07.800
where you're gonna make some enemies.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.040
So let me ask,

20:09.040 --> 20:11.840
because we've been talking about physics and engineering.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.720
Which group of people is smarter

20:15.720 --> 20:17.800
and more important for this one?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.560
Let me ask the question in a better way.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.600
Some of the big innovations,

20:22.600 --> 20:25.720
some of the beautiful things that we've been talking about,

20:25.720 --> 20:26.960
how much of it is physics?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.440
How much of it is engineering?

20:28.440 --> 20:31.640
My dad is a physicist, and he talks down

20:31.640 --> 20:34.440
to all the amazing engineering that we're doing

20:34.440 --> 20:37.920
in the artificial intelligence and the computer science

20:37.920 --> 20:39.560
and the robotics and all that space.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.640
So we argue about this all the time.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.520
So what do you think?

20:42.520 --> 20:43.920
Who gets more credit?

20:43.920 --> 20:45.440
I'm genuinely not trying

20:45.440 --> 20:46.760
to just be politically correct here.

20:46.800 --> 20:50.520
I don't see how you would have any of the,

20:50.520 --> 20:52.640
what we consider sort of the great accomplishments

20:52.640 --> 20:54.160
of society without both.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.920
You absolutely need both of those things.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.680
Physics tends to play a key role earlier in the development

20:59.680 --> 21:04.680
and then engineering optimization, these things take over.

21:04.680 --> 21:09.240
And I mean, the invention of the transistor,

21:09.240 --> 21:10.880
or actually even before that,

21:10.880 --> 21:12.880
the understanding of semiconductor physics

21:12.880 --> 21:14.840
that allowed the invention of the transistor,

21:14.840 --> 21:15.680
that's all physics.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.960
So if you didn't have that physics,

21:16.960 --> 21:20.280
you don't even get to get on the field.

21:20.280 --> 21:24.160
But once you have understood and demonstrated

21:24.160 --> 21:26.480
that this is in principle possible,

21:26.480 --> 21:28.360
Moore's law is engineering.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.160
Why we have computers more powerful

21:32.160 --> 21:36.360
than old supercomputers in each of our phones,

21:36.360 --> 21:37.480
that's all engineering.

21:37.480 --> 21:41.680
And I think I would be quite foolish to say

21:41.680 --> 21:45.000
that that's not valuable.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.960
But that's not a great contribution.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.840
It's a beautiful dance.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.760
Would you put like silicon,

21:49.760 --> 21:52.800
the understanding of the material properties

21:52.800 --> 21:54.360
in the space of engineering?

21:54.360 --> 21:55.720
Like, how does that whole process work

21:55.720 --> 21:58.040
to understand that it has all these nice properties

21:58.040 --> 22:02.280
or even the development of photolithography?

22:02.280 --> 22:03.880
Is that basically,

22:03.880 --> 22:06.160
would you put that in a category of engineering?

22:06.160 --> 22:10.000
No, I would say that it is basic physics,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.800
it is applied physics, it's material science,

22:12.800 --> 22:17.680
it's X-ray crystallography, it's polymer chemistry,

22:17.680 --> 22:18.840
it's everything.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.280
So chemistry even is thrown in there?

22:20.280 --> 22:22.600
Absolutely, yes, yes, absolutely.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.880
Just no biology.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.600
We can get to biology.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.280
Or the biology is in the humans

22:28.280 --> 22:29.520
that are engineering the system

22:29.520 --> 22:31.240
so it's all integrated deeply.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.600
Okay, so let's return,

22:32.600 --> 22:35.680
you mentioned this word superconductivity.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.640
So what does that have to do with what we're talking about?

22:38.640 --> 22:40.560
Right, okay, so in a semiconductor,

22:40.560 --> 22:44.280
as I tried to describe a second ago,

22:44.280 --> 22:49.280
you can sort of induce currents by applying voltages

22:50.040 --> 22:52.280
and those have sort of typical properties

22:52.280 --> 22:55.400
that you would expect from some kind of a conductor.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.400
Those electrons, they don't just flow perfectly

22:59.400 --> 23:00.360
without dissipation.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.240
If an electron collides with an imperfection in the lattice

23:03.240 --> 23:05.600
or another electron, it's gonna slow down,

23:05.600 --> 23:06.880
it's gonna lose its momentum.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.280
So you have to keep applying that voltage

23:09.280 --> 23:11.320
in order to keep the current flowing.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.480
In a superconductor, something different happens.

23:13.480 --> 23:16.560
If you get a current to start flowing,

23:16.560 --> 23:18.320
it will continue to flow indefinitely.

23:18.320 --> 23:19.920
There's no dissipation.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.520
So that's crazy, how does that happen?

23:22.520 --> 23:26.840
Well, it happens at low temperature and this is crucial.

23:26.840 --> 23:30.240
It has to be a quite low temperature

23:30.240 --> 23:32.840
and what I'm talking about there,

23:33.800 --> 23:35.840
for essentially all of our conversation,

23:35.840 --> 23:38.720
I'm gonna be talking about conventional superconductors

23:39.800 --> 23:42.240
sometimes called low TC superconductors,

23:42.240 --> 23:45.120
low critical temperature superconductors.

23:45.120 --> 23:50.120
And so those materials have to be at a temperature around,

23:50.640 --> 23:51.960
say around four Kelvin.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.560
I mean, their critical temperature might be 10 Kelvin,

23:54.560 --> 23:56.120
something like that, but you wanna operate them

23:56.120 --> 23:59.320
at around four Kelvin, four degrees above absolute zero.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.640
And what happens at that temperature,

24:01.640 --> 24:03.880
at very low temperatures in certain materials

24:03.880 --> 24:08.880
is that the noise of atoms moving

24:09.560 --> 24:12.520
around the lattice vibrating electrons

24:12.520 --> 24:15.120
colliding with each other, that becomes sufficiently low

24:15.120 --> 24:18.600
that the electrons can settle into this very special state.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.280
It's sometimes referred to as a macroscopic quantum state

24:22.280 --> 24:26.560
because if I had a piece of superconducting material here,

24:26.560 --> 24:30.920
let's say niobium is a very typical superconductor.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.640
If I had a block of niobium here

24:33.640 --> 24:36.680
and we cooled it below its critical temperature,

24:36.720 --> 24:40.880
all of the electrons in that superconducting state

24:40.880 --> 24:42.840
would be in one coherent quantum state.

24:42.840 --> 24:47.560
They would, the wave function of that state is described

24:47.560 --> 24:49.800
in terms of all of the particles simultaneously,

24:49.800 --> 24:52.280
but it extends across macroscopic dimensions,

24:52.280 --> 24:53.760
the size of whatever material,

24:53.760 --> 24:56.160
the size of whatever block of that material

24:56.160 --> 24:57.080
I have sitting here.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.480
And the way this occurs is that,

25:01.280 --> 25:03.520
let's try to be a little bit light on the technical details,

25:03.520 --> 25:06.560
but essentially the electrons coordinate with each other.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.320
They are able to, in this macroscopic quantum state,

25:10.320 --> 25:12.280
they're able to sort of,

25:12.280 --> 25:14.400
one can quickly take the place of the other.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.800
You can't tell electrons apart.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.720
They're what's known as identical particles.

25:17.720 --> 25:22.040
So if this electron runs into a defect

25:22.040 --> 25:25.000
that would otherwise cause it to scatter,

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
it can just sort of almost miraculously avoid that defect

25:30.440 --> 25:32.240
because it's not really in that location.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.960
It's part of a macroscopic quantum state

25:33.960 --> 25:35.640
and the entire quantum state

25:35.640 --> 25:37.120
was not scattered by that defect.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.720
So you can get a current that flows without dissipation

25:40.720 --> 25:42.920
and that's called a supercurrent.

25:42.920 --> 25:47.400
That's sort of just very much scratching the surface

25:47.400 --> 25:49.800
of superconductivity.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.200
There's very deep and rich physics there,

25:52.200 --> 25:54.480
just probably not the main subject

25:54.480 --> 25:55.600
we need to go into right now.

25:55.600 --> 26:00.480
But it turns out that when you have this material,

26:00.480 --> 26:03.520
you can do usual things like make wires out of it.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.440
So you can get current to flow in a straight line on a chip,

26:06.440 --> 26:08.920
but you can also make other devices

26:08.920 --> 26:11.920
that perform different kinds of operations.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.760
Some of them are kind of logic operations

26:14.760 --> 26:16.680
like you'd get in a transistor.

26:16.680 --> 26:21.680
The most common or the most, I would say,

26:22.600 --> 26:26.920
diverse in its utility component is a Josephson junction.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.000
It's not analogous to a transistor

26:29.000 --> 26:31.480
in the sense that if you apply a voltage here,

26:31.480 --> 26:33.840
it changes how much current flows from left to right,

26:33.840 --> 26:37.160
but it is analogous in sort of a sense of,

26:37.160 --> 26:41.040
it's the go-to component that a circuit engineer

26:41.040 --> 26:44.480
is going to use to start to build up more complexity.

26:44.480 --> 26:48.800
So these junctions serve as gates?

26:48.800 --> 26:50.480
They can serve as gates.

26:50.480 --> 26:55.480
They can, so I'm not sure how concerned to be with semantics,

26:56.520 --> 26:59.440
but let me just briefly say what a Josephson junction is

26:59.440 --> 27:00.920
and we can talk about different ways

27:00.920 --> 27:02.240
that they can be used.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.280
Basically, if you have a superconducting wire

27:05.280 --> 27:09.680
and then a small gap of a different material

27:09.680 --> 27:13.520
that's not superconducting, an insulator or normal metal,

27:13.520 --> 27:15.800
and then another superconducting wire on the other side,

27:15.800 --> 27:17.040
that's a Josephson junction.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.600
So it's sometimes referred to

27:18.600 --> 27:20.320
as a superconducting weak link.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.200
So you have this superconducting state on one side

27:24.200 --> 27:25.080
and on the other side,

27:25.080 --> 27:27.520
and the superconducting wave function

27:27.520 --> 27:30.840
actually tunnels across that gap.

27:31.720 --> 27:35.440
When you create such a physical entity,

27:35.440 --> 27:40.440
it has very unusual current voltage characteristics.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.240
In that gap, like weird stuff happens.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.160
Through the entire circuit.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.600
So you can imagine, suppose you had a loop setup

27:47.600 --> 27:51.240
that had one of those weak links in the loop.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.240
Current would flow in that loop,

27:53.240 --> 27:55.640
independent, even if you hadn't applied a voltage to it,

27:55.640 --> 27:57.040
and that's called the Josephson effect.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.520
So the fact that there's this phase difference

28:01.200 --> 28:02.160
in the quantum wave function

28:02.160 --> 28:04.400
from one side of the tunneling barrier to the other

28:04.400 --> 28:05.760
induces current to flow.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.720
So how does it change state?

28:07.720 --> 28:08.560
Right, exactly.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.600
So how do you change state?

28:09.600 --> 28:13.920
Now picture if I have a current bias coming down

28:13.920 --> 28:14.960
this line of my circuit,

28:14.960 --> 28:18.160
and there's a Josephson junction right in the middle of it.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.000
And now I make another wire

28:20.000 --> 28:21.840
that goes around the Josephson junction.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.640
So I have a loop here, a superconducting loop.

28:24.640 --> 28:28.000
I can add current to that loop

28:28.000 --> 28:30.880
by exceeding the critical current of that Josephson junction.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.000
So like any superconducting material,

28:35.000 --> 28:37.720
it can carry this supercurrent that I've described,

28:37.720 --> 28:40.560
this current that can propagate without dissipation

28:40.560 --> 28:41.840
up to a certain level.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.280
And if you try and pass more current than that

28:44.280 --> 28:45.960
through the material,

28:45.960 --> 28:49.240
it's going to become a resistive material,

28:49.240 --> 28:51.160
a normal material.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.160
So in the Josephson junction, the same thing happens.

28:54.160 --> 28:57.120
I can bias it above its critical current,

28:57.120 --> 28:58.200
and then what it's gonna do,

28:58.200 --> 29:03.200
it's going to add a quantized amount of current

29:03.560 --> 29:04.400
into that loop.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.320
And what I mean by quantized is

29:06.320 --> 29:09.000
it's going to come in discrete packets

29:09.000 --> 29:11.200
with a well-defined value of current.

29:11.200 --> 29:15.320
So in the vernacular of some people working

29:15.320 --> 29:16.840
in this community,

29:16.840 --> 29:20.200
you would say you pop a fluxon into the loop.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.720
So a fluxon.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.680
You pop a fluxon into the loop.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.520
Yeah, so a fluxon.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.520
Sounds like skateboarder talk, I love it.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.920
Sorry, go ahead.

29:28.920 --> 29:33.920
A fluxon is one of these quantized amounts of current

29:34.160 --> 29:35.200
that you can add to a loop.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.560
And this is a cartoon picture,

29:36.560 --> 29:38.400
but I think it's sufficient for our purposes.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.760
So which, maybe it's useful to say,

29:41.640 --> 29:45.440
what is the speed at which these discrete packets

29:45.440 --> 29:46.960
of current travel?

29:46.960 --> 29:49.120
Because we'll be talking about light a little bit.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.040
It seems like the speed is important.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.520
The speed is important, that's an excellent question.

29:53.560 --> 29:57.440
Sometimes I wonder how you became so astute.

30:00.840 --> 30:04.400
Matrix four is coming out, so maybe that's related.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.240
I'm not sure.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.000
I'm dressed for the job.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.360
I was trying to become an extra on matrix four.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.680
It didn't work out.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.280
Anyway, so what's the speed of these packets?

30:13.280 --> 30:15.000
You'll have to find another gig.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.600
I know, I'm sorry.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.400
So the speed of the pack is actually these fluxons,

30:19.920 --> 30:24.280
these sort of pulses of current

30:24.280 --> 30:26.160
that are generated by Joseph's injunctions.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.440
They can actually propagate very close

30:28.440 --> 30:29.720
to the speed of light,

30:29.720 --> 30:31.880
maybe something like a third of the speed of light.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.840
That's quite fast.

30:32.840 --> 30:37.240
So one of the reasons why Joseph's injunctions are appealing

30:37.240 --> 30:40.560
is because their signals can propagate quite fast

30:40.560 --> 30:43.400
and they can also switch very fast.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.040
What I mean by switch is perform that operation

30:46.040 --> 30:49.400
that I described where you add current to the loop.

30:49.400 --> 30:53.920
That can happen within a few tens of picoseconds.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.840
So you can get devices that operate

30:56.840 --> 30:58.800
in the hundreds of gigahertz range.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.040
And by comparison, most processors

31:02.040 --> 31:04.920
in our conventional computers operate closer

31:04.920 --> 31:08.320
to the one gigahertz range, maybe three gigahertz

31:08.320 --> 31:12.920
seems to be kind of where those speeds have leveled out.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.560
The gamers listening to this are getting really excited

31:15.720 --> 31:17.680
to overclock their system to like,

31:17.680 --> 31:19.600
what is it, like four gigahertz or something?

31:19.600 --> 31:22.000
100 sounds incredible.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.080
Can I just, as a tiny tangent,

31:24.080 --> 31:26.920
is the physics of this understood well

31:26.920 --> 31:28.560
how to do this stably?

31:28.560 --> 31:30.200
Oh yes, the physics is understood well.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.560
The physics of Joseph's injunctions is understood well.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.560
The technology is understood quite well too.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.640
The reasons why it hasn't displaced

31:37.640 --> 31:41.760
silicon microelectronics in conventional digital computing

31:41.760 --> 31:45.080
I think are more related to what I was alluding to before

31:45.080 --> 31:49.280
about the myriad practical, almost mundane aspects

31:49.280 --> 31:52.120
of silicon that make it so useful.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.920
You can make a transistor ever smaller and smaller

31:55.920 --> 31:58.880
and it will still performance digital function quite well.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.800
The same is not true of a Joseph's injunction.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.440
You really, they don't, they just,

32:02.440 --> 32:04.480
it's not the same thing that there's this feature

32:04.480 --> 32:06.320
that you can keep making smaller and smaller

32:06.320 --> 32:08.240
and it'll keep performing the same operations.

32:08.240 --> 32:11.520
This loop I described, any Joseph's in circuit,

32:11.520 --> 32:13.160
well, I want to be careful,

32:13.160 --> 32:14.720
I shouldn't say any Joseph's in circuit,

32:14.720 --> 32:17.280
but many Joseph's in circuits,

32:17.280 --> 32:19.480
the way they process information

32:19.480 --> 32:21.320
or the way they perform whatever function it is

32:21.320 --> 32:22.160
they're trying to do,

32:22.160 --> 32:24.600
maybe it's sensing a weak magnetic field,

32:24.600 --> 32:27.520
it depends on an interplay between the junction

32:27.520 --> 32:28.840
and that loop.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.600
And you can't make that loop much smaller

32:30.600 --> 32:32.160
and it's not for practical reasons

32:32.160 --> 32:33.480
that have to do with lithography,

32:33.480 --> 32:35.720
it's for fundamental physical reasons

32:35.720 --> 32:39.000
about the way the magnetic field interacts

32:39.000 --> 32:41.200
with that superconducting material.

32:41.200 --> 32:44.400
There are physical limits that no matter how good

32:44.400 --> 32:47.280
our technology got, those circuits would,

32:47.280 --> 32:50.400
I think would never be able to be scaled down

32:50.400 --> 32:54.400
to the densities that silicon microelectronics can.

32:54.400 --> 32:55.600
I don't know if we mentioned,

32:55.600 --> 32:57.000
is there something interesting

32:57.000 --> 33:00.240
about the various superconducting materials involved

33:00.240 --> 33:01.080
or is it all?

33:01.080 --> 33:02.680
There's a lot of stuff that's interesting.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.480
And it's not silicon?

33:04.480 --> 33:05.880
It's not silicon, no.

33:05.880 --> 33:09.560
So like it's some materials that also required

33:09.560 --> 33:12.040
to be super cold for Kelvin and so on.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.280
So let's dissect a couple of those different things.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.480
The super cold part, let me just mention

33:18.480 --> 33:19.640
for your gamers out there

33:19.640 --> 33:21.320
that are trying to clock it at four gigahertz

33:21.320 --> 33:22.160
and would love to go to 400.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.120
What kind of cooling system can it achieve for Kelvin?

33:24.120 --> 33:26.280
For Kelvin, you need liquid helium.

33:26.280 --> 33:29.880
And so liquid helium is expensive, it's inconvenient.

33:29.880 --> 33:32.080
You need a cryostat that sits there

33:32.080 --> 33:36.520
and the energy consumption of that cryostat

33:36.520 --> 33:40.040
is impracticable for, it's not going in your cell phone.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.080
So you can picture holding yourself on like this

33:42.080 --> 33:46.120
and then something the size of a keg of beer

33:46.120 --> 33:47.960
or something on your back to cool it.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.560
That makes no sense.

33:49.560 --> 33:54.120
So if you're trying to make this in consumer devices,

33:54.120 --> 33:57.000
electronics that are ubiquitous across society,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.280
superconductors are not in the race for that.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.000
For now, but you're saying,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.240
so just to frame the conversation,

34:03.240 --> 34:05.520
maybe the thing we're focused on

34:05.520 --> 34:09.480
is computing systems that serve as servers,

34:09.520 --> 34:10.360
like large systems.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.800
Yes, large systems.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.800
So then you can contrast what's going on in your cell phone

34:14.800 --> 34:18.240
with what's going on at one of the supercomputers.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.080
Colleague Katie Schumann invited us out to Oak Ridge

34:22.080 --> 34:24.080
a few years ago, so we got to see Titan

34:24.080 --> 34:26.120
and that was when they were building Summit.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.520
So these are some high performance supercomputers

34:29.520 --> 34:30.800
out in Tennessee.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.480
And those are filling entire rooms

34:32.480 --> 34:33.920
the size of warehouses.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.920
So once you're at that level,

34:35.920 --> 34:37.160
okay, there you're already putting

34:37.160 --> 34:38.360
a lot of power into cooling.

34:39.080 --> 34:42.240
Cooling is part of your engineering task

34:42.240 --> 34:43.600
that you have to deal with.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.600
So there, it's not entirely obvious

34:45.600 --> 34:49.480
that cooling to four Kelvin is out of the question.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.880
It has not happened yet,

34:51.880 --> 34:54.160
and I can speak to why that is in the digital domain

34:54.160 --> 34:55.520
if you're interested.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.520
I think it's not going to happen.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.520
I don't think superconductors

35:00.520 --> 35:04.640
are gonna replace semiconductors for digital computation.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.600
There are a lot of reasons for that,

35:07.600 --> 35:09.720
but I think ultimately what it comes down to

35:09.720 --> 35:13.360
is all things considered, cooling, errors,

35:13.360 --> 35:16.000
scaling down to feature sizes, all that stuff,

35:16.000 --> 35:19.360
semiconductors work better at the system level.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.680
Is there some aspect of just curious

35:22.680 --> 35:25.480
about the historical momentum of this?

35:25.480 --> 35:28.120
Is there some power to the momentum of an industry

35:28.120 --> 35:31.400
that's mass manufacturing using a certain material?

35:31.400 --> 35:33.600
Is this like a Titanic shifting?

35:33.600 --> 35:34.800
Like what's your sense?

35:34.800 --> 35:37.040
When a good idea comes along,

35:37.120 --> 35:39.920
how good does that idea need to be

35:39.920 --> 35:42.640
for the Titanic to start shifting?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.200
That's an excellent question.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.520
That's an excellent way to frame it.

35:46.520 --> 35:51.320
And you know, I don't know the answer to that,

35:51.320 --> 35:53.600
but what I think is, okay,

35:53.600 --> 35:56.400
so the history of the superconducting logic

35:56.400 --> 35:58.000
goes back to the 70s.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.760
IBM made a big push to do

35:59.760 --> 36:02.400
superconducting digital computing in the 70s,

36:02.400 --> 36:06.120
and they made some choices about their devices

36:06.120 --> 36:07.360
and their architectures and things

36:07.360 --> 36:11.000
that in hindsight were kind of doomed to fail.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.120
And I don't mean any disrespect for the people that did it,

36:13.120 --> 36:14.280
it was hard to see at the time.

36:14.280 --> 36:17.880
But then another generation of superconducting logic

36:17.880 --> 36:22.320
was introduced, I wanna say the 90s,

36:22.320 --> 36:24.960
someone named Lykarev and Seminov,

36:24.960 --> 36:28.280
they proposed an entire family of circuits

36:28.280 --> 36:29.960
based on Joseph's injunctions

36:29.960 --> 36:33.440
that are doing digital computing based on logic gates

36:33.440 --> 36:36.600
and or not these kinds of things.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.560
And they showed how it could go hundreds of times faster

36:41.560 --> 36:43.200
than silicon microelectronics.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.360
And it was, it's extremely exciting.

36:45.360 --> 36:47.040
I wasn't working in the field at that time,

36:47.040 --> 36:49.560
but later when I went back and read the literature,

36:49.560 --> 36:52.840
I was just like, wow, this is so awesome.

36:52.840 --> 36:56.000
And so you might think, well,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.280
the reason why it didn't display silicon

36:58.280 --> 37:00.400
is because silicon already had so much momentum

37:00.400 --> 37:01.720
at that time.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.280
But that was the 90s, silicon kept that momentum

37:04.280 --> 37:06.920
because it had the simple way to keep getting better.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.680
You just make features smaller and smaller.

37:08.680 --> 37:11.760
So it would have to be,

37:11.760 --> 37:13.520
I don't think it would have to be that much better

37:13.520 --> 37:15.400
than silicon to displace it.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.760
But the problem is it's just not better than silicon.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.920
It might be better than silicon in one metric,

37:19.920 --> 37:21.400
speed of a switching operation

37:21.400 --> 37:24.360
or power consumption of a switching operation.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.000
But building a digital computer

37:26.000 --> 37:28.680
is a lot more than just that elemental operation.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.000
It's everything that goes into it,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.320
including the manufacturing, including the packaging,

37:33.320 --> 37:38.320
including the various materials aspects of things.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.800
So the reason why, and even in some of those early papers,

37:42.800 --> 37:44.120
I can't remember which one it was,

37:44.120 --> 37:47.480
Lykorev said something along the lines of,

37:47.480 --> 37:49.920
you can see how we could build an entire family

37:49.920 --> 37:52.800
of digital electronic circuits based on these components.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.000
They could go a hundred or more times faster

37:55.000 --> 37:59.320
than semiconductor logic gates.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.880
But I don't think that's the right way

38:00.880 --> 38:02.640
to use superconducting electronic circuits.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.280
He didn't say what the right way was,

38:04.280 --> 38:07.400
but he basically said digital logic

38:07.400 --> 38:11.240
trying to steal the show from silicon

38:11.240 --> 38:13.400
is probably not what these circuits

38:13.400 --> 38:16.320
are most suited to accomplish.

38:16.320 --> 38:20.800
So if we can just linger and use the word computation,

38:20.800 --> 38:24.080
when you talk about computation, how do you think about it?

38:24.080 --> 38:28.920
Do you think purely on just the switching

38:28.920 --> 38:31.320
or do you think something a little bit larger scale

38:31.320 --> 38:32.760
a circuit taken together,

38:32.760 --> 38:36.960
performing the basic arithmetic operations

38:36.960 --> 38:40.440
that are then required to do the kind of computation

38:40.440 --> 38:42.200
that makes up a computer?

38:42.200 --> 38:44.440
Because when we talk about the speed of computation,

38:44.440 --> 38:47.000
is it well down to the basic switching

38:47.000 --> 38:49.200
or is there some bigger picture that you're thinking about?

38:49.200 --> 38:52.240
Well, all right, so maybe we should disambiguate.

38:52.240 --> 38:55.600
There are a variety of different kinds of computation.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.200
I don't pretend to be an expert

38:57.200 --> 39:00.160
in the theory of computation or anything like that.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.640
I guess it's important to differentiate though

39:02.640 --> 39:05.800
between digital logic,

39:05.800 --> 39:09.800
which represents information as a series of bits,

39:09.800 --> 39:11.240
binary digits,

39:11.240 --> 39:14.160
which you can think of them as zeros and ones or whatever.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.400
Usually they correspond to a physical system

39:17.400 --> 39:21.240
that has two very well separated states.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.840
And then other kinds of computation,

39:22.840 --> 39:25.280
like we'll get into more the way your brain works,

39:25.280 --> 39:30.280
which it is, I think indisputably processing information,

39:30.400 --> 39:34.080
but where the computation begins and ends

39:34.080 --> 39:36.360
is not anywhere near as well defined.

39:36.360 --> 39:39.680
It doesn't depend on these two levels.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.320
Here's a zero, here's a one.

39:41.320 --> 39:42.640
There's a lot of gray area

39:42.640 --> 39:45.640
that's usually referred to as analog computing.

39:46.520 --> 39:49.880
Also in conventional digital computers

39:49.880 --> 39:54.240
or digital computers in general,

39:54.320 --> 39:57.240
you have a concept of what's called arithmetic depth,

39:57.240 --> 39:59.760
which is jargon that basically means

39:59.760 --> 40:03.800
how many sequential operations are performed

40:03.800 --> 40:07.600
to turn an input into an output.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.840
And those kinds of computations in digital systems

40:10.840 --> 40:12.720
are highly serial,

40:12.720 --> 40:14.440
meaning that data streams,

40:14.440 --> 40:16.440
they don't branch off too far to the side.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.840
You do, you have to pull some information over there

40:18.840 --> 40:20.840
and access memory from here and stuff like that.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.640
But by and large,

40:22.640 --> 40:26.200
the computation proceeds in a serial manner.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.720
It's not that way in the brain.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.720
In the brain, you're always drawing information

40:30.720 --> 40:31.560
from different places.

40:31.560 --> 40:33.760
It's much more network-based computing.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.640
Neurons don't wait for their turn.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.160
They fire when they're ready to fire.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.160
And so it's asynchronous.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.640
So one of the other things about a digital system

40:41.640 --> 40:44.480
is you're performing these operations on a clock.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.680
And that's a crucial aspect of it.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.880
Get rid of a clock in a digital system,

40:48.880 --> 40:50.440
nothing makes sense anymore.

40:51.040 --> 40:51.880
The brain has no clock.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.560
It builds its own time scales

40:53.560 --> 40:55.280
based on its internal activity.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.640
So you can think of the brain

40:57.640 --> 41:00.880
as kind of like this network computation

41:00.880 --> 41:04.560
where it's actually really trivial, simple computers,

41:05.680 --> 41:08.960
just a huge number of them and they're networked.

41:08.960 --> 41:12.920
I would say it is complex, sophisticated little processors

41:12.920 --> 41:14.400
and there's a huge number of them.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.160
Neurons are not simple.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.560
I don't mean to offend neurons.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.480
They're very complicated and beautiful.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.000
But we often oversimplify them.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
Yes, there's computation happening within a neuron.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.560
So I would say to think of a transistor

41:29.560 --> 41:32.400
as the building block of a digital computer is accurate.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.720
You use a few transistors to make your logic gates.

41:34.720 --> 41:37.880
You build up processors from logic gates

41:37.880 --> 41:39.200
and things like that.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.640
So you can think of a transistor

41:40.640 --> 41:42.320
as a fundamental building block

41:42.320 --> 41:43.440
or you can think of,

41:43.440 --> 41:46.400
as we get into more highly parallelized architectures,

41:46.400 --> 41:47.720
you can think of a processor

41:47.720 --> 41:49.360
as a fundamental building block

41:50.280 --> 41:53.160
to make the analogy to the neuro side of things.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.320
A neuron is not a transistor.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.320
A neuron is a processor.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.200
It has synapses, even synapses are not transistors,

42:00.200 --> 42:03.080
but they are lower

42:03.080 --> 42:05.400
on the information processing hierarchy in a sense.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.200
They do a bulk of the computation,

42:08.200 --> 42:13.200
but neurons are entire processors in and of themselves

42:13.600 --> 42:16.280
that can take in many different kinds of inputs

42:16.280 --> 42:18.760
on many different spatial and temporal scales

42:18.840 --> 42:20.840
and produce many different kinds of outputs

42:20.840 --> 42:23.840
so that they can perform different computations

42:23.840 --> 42:24.880
in different contexts.

42:24.880 --> 42:27.440
So this is where enters this distinction

42:27.440 --> 42:30.760
between computation and communication.

42:30.760 --> 42:34.160
So you can think of neurons performing computation

42:34.160 --> 42:39.000
and the networking, the interconnectivity of neurons

42:39.000 --> 42:40.960
is communication between neurons.

42:40.960 --> 42:44.040
And you see this with very large server systems.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.040
I mentioned offline,

42:45.040 --> 42:46.160
we're talking to Jim Keller,

42:46.160 --> 42:48.160
whose dream is to build giant computers

42:48.160 --> 42:52.400
that the bottleneck there is often the communication

42:52.400 --> 42:54.720
between the different pieces of computing.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.400
So in this paper that we mentioned,

42:57.400 --> 42:59.680
optoelectronic intelligence,

42:59.680 --> 43:03.200
you say electrons excel at computation

43:03.200 --> 43:08.200
while light is excellent for communication.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.040
Maybe you can linger and say in this context,

43:11.040 --> 43:14.000
what do you mean by computation and communication?

43:14.000 --> 43:16.080
What are electrons?

43:16.080 --> 43:17.440
What is light?

43:17.440 --> 43:20.680
And why do they excel at those two tasks?

43:20.680 --> 43:23.600
Yeah, just to first speak to computation

43:23.600 --> 43:25.640
versus communication,

43:25.640 --> 43:30.320
I would say computation is essentially taking in

43:30.320 --> 43:31.640
some information,

43:32.480 --> 43:34.680
performing operations on that information

43:34.680 --> 43:39.040
and producing new, hopefully more useful information.

43:39.040 --> 43:44.040
So for example, imagine you have a picture in front of you

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
and there is a key in it

43:48.000 --> 43:49.560
and that's what you're looking for, for whatever reason.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.520
You wanna find the key, we all wanna find the key.

43:51.520 --> 43:56.520
So the input is that entire picture

43:56.520 --> 43:59.000
and the output might be the coordinates where the key is.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.480
So you've reduced the total amount of information you have

44:01.480 --> 44:02.960
but you found the useful information

44:02.960 --> 44:04.360
for you in that present moment.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.440
That's the useful information.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.120
And you think about this computation

44:07.120 --> 44:10.800
as the controlled synchronous sequential.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.640
Not necessarily, it could be.

44:12.680 --> 44:16.240
That could be how your system is performing the computation

44:16.240 --> 44:19.320
or it could be asynchronous.

44:19.320 --> 44:21.400
There are lots of ways to find the key.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.720
It depends on the nature of the data.

44:23.720 --> 44:27.520
It depends on, that's a very simplified example,

44:27.520 --> 44:28.720
a picture with a key in it.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.520
What about if you're in the world

44:30.520 --> 44:35.520
and you're trying to decide the best way to live your life?

44:35.960 --> 44:37.040
It might be interactive.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.600
It might be, there might be some recurrence

44:38.600 --> 44:40.560
or some weird asynchrony.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.400
I got it.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.320
But there's an input and there's an output

44:43.320 --> 44:44.480
and you do some stuff in the middle

44:44.480 --> 44:46.080
that actually goes from the input to the output.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.400
You've taken in information

44:47.400 --> 44:49.120
and output different information,

44:49.120 --> 44:51.840
hopefully reducing the total amount of information

44:51.840 --> 44:53.840
and extracting what's useful.

44:53.840 --> 44:57.800
Communication is then getting that information

44:57.800 --> 44:59.480
from the location to which it's stored

44:59.480 --> 45:02.720
because information is physical as Landauer emphasized.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.040
And so it is in one place

45:05.040 --> 45:07.880
and you need to get that information to another place

45:07.880 --> 45:10.160
so that something else can use it

45:10.160 --> 45:12.080
for whatever computation it's working on.

45:12.080 --> 45:13.480
Maybe it's part of the same network

45:13.480 --> 45:15.040
and you're all trying to solve the same problem,

45:15.040 --> 45:20.040
but neuron A over here just deduced something

45:20.520 --> 45:21.640
based on its inputs

45:21.640 --> 45:25.240
and it's now sending that information across the network

45:25.240 --> 45:26.480
to another location.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.440
So that would be the act of communication.

45:28.440 --> 45:29.920
Can you linger on Landauer

45:29.920 --> 45:31.880
and saying information is physical?

45:31.880 --> 45:35.400
Rolf Landauer, not to be confused with Lev Landauer.

45:35.400 --> 45:38.040
Yeah, and he made huge contributions

45:38.040 --> 45:43.000
to our understanding of the reversibility of information

45:43.000 --> 45:46.720
and this concept that energy has to be dissipated

45:46.720 --> 45:50.160
in computing when the computation is irreversible.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.160
But if you can manage to make it reversible,

45:52.160 --> 45:55.120
then you don't need to expend energy.

45:55.120 --> 45:59.720
But if you do expend energy to perform a computation,

45:59.720 --> 46:02.400
there's sort of a minimal amount that you have to do

46:02.400 --> 46:04.520
and it's KT log two.

46:04.520 --> 46:05.960
And it's all somehow related

46:05.960 --> 46:07.720
to the second law of thermodynamics

46:08.400 --> 46:09.680
and that the universe is an information process

46:09.680 --> 46:11.600
and then we're living in a simulation.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.000
So, okay, sorry for that tangent.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.240
So that's defining the distinction

46:17.240 --> 46:19.640
between computation and communication.

46:19.640 --> 46:22.000
Let me say one more thing just to clarify.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
Communication ideally does not change the information.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.960
It moves it from one place to another,

46:28.960 --> 46:30.960
but it is preserved.

46:30.960 --> 46:32.560
Got it, okay.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.760
All right, that is beautiful.

46:33.760 --> 46:38.640
So then the electron versus light distinction

46:38.640 --> 46:42.440
and why are electrons good at computation

46:42.440 --> 46:44.560
and light good at communication?

46:44.560 --> 46:48.840
Yes, there's a lot that goes into it, I guess,

46:48.840 --> 46:51.720
but just try to speak to the simplest part of it.

46:54.120 --> 46:57.040
Electrons interact strongly with one another.

46:57.040 --> 46:58.360
They're charged particles.

46:58.360 --> 47:02.040
So if I pile a bunch of them over here,

47:02.080 --> 47:03.920
they're feeling a certain amount of force

47:03.920 --> 47:05.920
and they wanna move somewhere else.

47:05.920 --> 47:06.960
They're strongly interactive.

47:06.960 --> 47:09.600
You can also get them to sit still.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.400
An electron has a mass so you can cause it

47:12.400 --> 47:15.920
to be spatially localized.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.160
So for computation, that's useful

47:18.160 --> 47:20.200
because now I can make these little devices

47:20.200 --> 47:22.000
that put a bunch of electrons over here

47:22.000 --> 47:25.680
and then I change the state of a gate

47:25.680 --> 47:26.560
like I've been describing,

47:26.560 --> 47:28.440
put a different voltage on this gate

47:28.440 --> 47:30.040
and now I move the electrons over here.

47:30.040 --> 47:31.280
Now they're sitting somewhere else.

47:31.280 --> 47:34.000
I have a physical mechanism

47:34.000 --> 47:36.080
with which I can represent information.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.160
It's spatially localized and I have knobs

47:38.160 --> 47:41.280
that I can adjust to change where those electrons are

47:41.280 --> 47:42.440
or what they're doing.

47:42.440 --> 47:46.000
Light by contrast, photons of light,

47:46.000 --> 47:48.160
which are the discrete packets of energy

47:48.160 --> 47:50.840
that were identified by Einstein,

47:50.840 --> 47:53.560
they do not interact with each other,

47:54.640 --> 47:56.320
especially at low light levels.

47:56.320 --> 48:00.440
If you're in a medium and you have a bright high light level,

48:00.800 --> 48:02.560
you can get them to interact with each other

48:02.560 --> 48:05.360
through the interaction with that medium that they're in,

48:05.360 --> 48:07.840
but that's a little bit more exotic

48:07.840 --> 48:10.360
and for the purposes of this conversation,

48:10.360 --> 48:13.200
we can assume that photons don't interact with each other.

48:13.200 --> 48:16.120
So if you have a bunch of them

48:16.120 --> 48:17.600
all propagating in the same direction,

48:17.600 --> 48:19.160
they don't interfere with each other.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.960
If I want to send, if I have a communication channel

48:22.960 --> 48:24.480
and I put one more photon on it,

48:24.480 --> 48:26.040
it doesn't screw up with those other,

48:26.040 --> 48:29.120
it doesn't change what those other ones were doing at all.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.320
So that's really useful for communication

48:31.320 --> 48:34.000
because that means you can sort of allow a lot

48:34.000 --> 48:38.880
of these photons to flow without disruption of each other

48:38.880 --> 48:41.160
and they can branch really easily and things like that,

48:41.160 --> 48:42.760
but it's not good for computation

48:42.760 --> 48:46.400
because it's very hard for this packet of light

48:46.400 --> 48:48.760
to change what this packet of light is doing.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.240
They pass right through each other.

48:50.240 --> 48:53.320
So in computation, you want to change information

48:53.320 --> 48:55.760
and if photons don't interact with each other,

48:55.760 --> 48:58.080
it's difficult to get them to change the information

48:58.080 --> 48:59.440
represented by the others.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.600
So that's the fundamental differences.

49:01.600 --> 49:04.840
Is there also something about the way they travel

49:04.840 --> 49:06.480
through different materials

49:07.520 --> 49:10.760
or is that just a particular engineering?

49:10.760 --> 49:12.640
No, it's not, that's deep physics, I think.

49:12.640 --> 49:17.120
So this gets back to electrons interact with each other

49:17.120 --> 49:18.200
and photons don't.

49:18.200 --> 49:22.480
So say I'm trying to get a packet of information

49:22.480 --> 49:25.880
from me to you and we have a wire going between us.

49:25.880 --> 49:29.080
In order for me to send electrons across that wire,

49:29.080 --> 49:32.280
I first have to raise the voltage on my end of the wire

49:32.280 --> 49:34.680
and that means putting a bunch of charges on it

49:34.680 --> 49:37.880
and then that charge packet has to propagate

49:37.880 --> 49:41.320
along the wire and it has to get all the way over to you.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.440
That wire is gonna have something that's called capacitance,

49:44.440 --> 49:47.240
which basically tells you how much charge you need

49:47.240 --> 49:50.000
to put on the wire in order to raise the voltage on it

49:50.000 --> 49:52.560
and the capacitance is gonna be proportional

49:52.560 --> 49:54.080
to the length of the wire.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.920
So the longer the length of the wire is,

49:56.920 --> 49:59.160
the more charge I have to put on it

49:59.160 --> 50:03.120
and the energy required to charge up that line

50:03.120 --> 50:05.000
and move those electrons to you

50:05.000 --> 50:06.880
is also proportional to the capacitance

50:06.880 --> 50:08.560
and goes as the voltage squared.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.600
So you get this huge penalty

50:10.600 --> 50:15.080
if you wanna send electrons across a wire

50:15.080 --> 50:16.640
over appreciable distances.

50:16.640 --> 50:19.160
So distance is an important thing here

50:19.160 --> 50:20.840
when you're doing communication.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.160
Distance is an important thing.

50:22.160 --> 50:25.400
So is the number of connections I'm trying to make.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.680
Me to you, okay, one, that's not so bad.

50:27.680 --> 50:31.480
If I want to now send it to 10,000 other friends,

50:31.480 --> 50:33.400
then all of those wires

50:33.400 --> 50:35.520
are adding tons of extra capacitance.

50:35.520 --> 50:37.720
Now, not only does it take forever

50:37.720 --> 50:39.600
to put the charge on that wire

50:39.600 --> 50:41.880
and raise the voltage on all those lines,

50:41.880 --> 50:43.600
but it takes a ton of power

50:43.600 --> 50:47.040
and the number 10,000 is not randomly chosen.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.120
That's roughly how many connections

50:49.120 --> 50:50.680
each neuron in your brain makes.

50:51.160 --> 50:55.040
A neuron in your brain needs to send 10,000 messages

50:55.040 --> 50:56.760
every time it has something to say.

50:56.760 --> 51:00.120
You can't do that if you're trying to drive electrons

51:00.120 --> 51:02.080
from here to 10,000 different places.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.680
The brain does it in a slightly different way,

51:03.680 --> 51:04.880
which we can discuss.

51:04.880 --> 51:07.040
How can light achieve the 10,000 connections

51:07.040 --> 51:12.040
and why is it better in terms of like the energy use

51:12.040 --> 51:14.240
required to use light for the communication

51:14.240 --> 51:15.280
of the 10,000 connections?

51:15.280 --> 51:16.120
Right, right.

51:16.120 --> 51:18.240
So now instead of trying to send electrons for me to you,

51:18.240 --> 51:19.360
I'm trying to send photons.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.560
So I can make what's called a wave guide,

51:21.560 --> 51:25.160
which is just a simple piece of a material.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.000
It could be glass,

51:26.000 --> 51:29.920
like an optical fiber or silicon on a chip.

51:29.920 --> 51:34.200
And I just have to inject photons into that wave guide

51:34.200 --> 51:35.840
and independent of how long it is,

51:35.840 --> 51:39.680
independent of how many different connections I'm making,

51:39.680 --> 51:43.160
it doesn't change the voltage or anything like that

51:43.160 --> 51:45.520
that I have to raise up on the wire.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.960
So if I have one more connection,

51:47.960 --> 51:49.840
if I add additional connections,

51:49.840 --> 51:51.800
I need to add more light to the wave guide

51:51.800 --> 51:53.320
because those photons need to split

51:53.320 --> 51:55.080
and go to different paths.

51:55.080 --> 51:58.880
That makes sense, but I don't have a capacitive penalty.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.320
Sometimes these are called wiring parasitics.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.480
There are no parasitics associated with light

52:03.480 --> 52:05.160
in that same sense.

52:05.160 --> 52:07.520
Well, this might be a dumb question,

52:07.520 --> 52:10.640
but how do I catch a photon on the other end?

52:11.400 --> 52:12.560
Is it material?

52:12.560 --> 52:15.040
Is it the polymer stuff you were talking about

52:15.920 --> 52:19.440
for a different application for photolithography?

52:19.440 --> 52:21.000
Like, how do you catch a photon?

52:21.000 --> 52:22.520
There's a lot of ways to catch a photon.

52:22.520 --> 52:23.640
It's not a dumb question.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.960
It's a deep and important question

52:25.960 --> 52:29.240
that basically defines a lot of the work

52:29.240 --> 52:31.400
that goes on in our group at NIST.

52:31.400 --> 52:34.320
One of my group leaders, Sehwoonam,

52:34.320 --> 52:36.320
has built his career around these

52:36.320 --> 52:38.440
superconducting single photon detectors.

52:38.440 --> 52:42.480
So if you're going to try to sort of reach a lower limit

52:42.520 --> 52:45.280
and detect just one particle of light,

52:45.280 --> 52:47.680
superconductors come back into our conversation

52:47.680 --> 52:50.160
and just picture a simple device

52:50.160 --> 52:51.880
where you have current flowing through

52:51.880 --> 52:53.240
a superconducting wire.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.600
A loop again or no?

52:56.600 --> 52:57.840
Let's say yes, you have a loop.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.600
So you have a superconducting wire

52:59.600 --> 53:01.040
that goes straight down like this.

53:01.040 --> 53:04.280
And on your loop branch, you have a little ammeter,

53:04.280 --> 53:05.840
something that measures current.

53:05.840 --> 53:08.000
There's a resistor up there too.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
Go with me here.

53:09.040 --> 53:12.040
So you're current biasing this.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.080
So there's current flowing

53:13.080 --> 53:14.440
through that superconducting branch.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.600
Since there's a resistor over here,

53:16.600 --> 53:18.960
all the current goes through the superconducting branch.

53:18.960 --> 53:22.320
Now a photon comes in, strikes that superconductor.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.320
We talked about this superconducting

53:24.320 --> 53:25.800
macroscopic quantum state.

53:25.800 --> 53:28.520
That's going to be destroyed by the energy of that photon.

53:28.520 --> 53:32.120
So now that branch of the circuit is resistive too.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.800
And you've properly designed your circuit

53:33.800 --> 53:36.720
so that the resistance on that superconducting branch

53:36.720 --> 53:38.440
is much greater than the other resistance.

53:38.440 --> 53:40.760
Now all of your current's going to go that way.

53:40.760 --> 53:43.280
Your ammeter says, oh, I just got a pulse of current.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.120
That must mean I detected a photon.

53:45.120 --> 53:47.240
Then where you broke that superconductivity

53:47.240 --> 53:49.120
in a matter of a few nanoseconds,

53:49.120 --> 53:51.120
it cools back off, dissipates that energy,

53:51.120 --> 53:52.800
and the current flows back

53:52.800 --> 53:54.280
through that superconducting branch.

53:54.280 --> 53:59.240
This is a very powerful superconducting device

53:59.240 --> 54:02.280
that allows us to understand quantum states of light.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.880
I didn't realize a loop like that

54:04.880 --> 54:07.160
could be sensitive to a single photon.

54:07.160 --> 54:11.360
I mean, that seems strange to me.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.360
Because, I mean, so what happens

54:14.360 --> 54:16.600
when you just barrage it with photons?

54:16.600 --> 54:18.360
If you put a bunch of photons in there,

54:18.360 --> 54:19.880
essentially the same thing happens.

54:19.880 --> 54:21.680
You just drive it into the normal state,

54:21.680 --> 54:23.160
it becomes resistive,

54:23.160 --> 54:25.400
and it's not particularly interesting.

54:25.400 --> 54:28.000
So you have to be careful how many photons you send.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.120
Like, you have to be very precise with your communication.

54:30.120 --> 54:31.240
Well, it depends.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.920
So I would say that that's actually,

54:32.920 --> 54:34.880
in the application that we're trying

54:34.880 --> 54:37.040
to use these detectors for,

54:37.040 --> 54:39.880
that's a feature because what we want is for,

54:41.120 --> 54:46.120
if a neuron sends one photon to a synaptic connection

54:46.640 --> 54:48.360
and one of these superconducting detectors

54:48.360 --> 54:51.200
is sitting there, you get this pulse of current

54:51.200 --> 54:54.000
and that synapse says, event,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.040
then I'm gonna do what I do when there's a synapse event,

54:56.040 --> 54:58.640
I'm gonna perform computations, that kind of thing.

54:58.640 --> 55:02.120
But if accidentally you send two there or three or five,

55:02.120 --> 55:03.360
it does the exact same.

55:03.360 --> 55:04.200
Got it.

55:05.160 --> 55:10.040
This is how in the system that we're devising here,

55:10.040 --> 55:12.760
communication is entirely binary.

55:12.760 --> 55:15.040
And that's what I tried to emphasize a second ago.

55:15.040 --> 55:17.800
Communication should not change the information.

55:17.800 --> 55:21.560
You're not saying, oh, I got this kind of communication event

55:21.560 --> 55:22.400
for photons.

55:22.400 --> 55:23.720
No, we're not keeping track of that.

55:23.720 --> 55:26.600
This neuron fired, this synapse says that neuron fired.

55:26.600 --> 55:27.440
That's it.

55:27.440 --> 55:31.480
So that's a noise filtering property of those detectors.

55:31.480 --> 55:33.120
However, there are other applications

55:33.120 --> 55:36.120
where you'd rather know the exact number of photons.

55:36.120 --> 55:39.320
That can be very useful in quantum computing with light.

55:39.320 --> 55:42.760
And our group does a lot of work around another kind

55:42.760 --> 55:46.640
of superconducting sensor called the transition edge sensor

55:46.640 --> 55:49.920
that Adriana Alita in our group does a lot of work on that.

55:49.920 --> 55:53.960
And that can tell you based on the amplitude

55:53.960 --> 55:55.760
of the current pulse you divert,

55:55.760 --> 55:59.800
exactly how many photons were in that pulse.

56:00.880 --> 56:02.520
What's that useful for?

56:02.520 --> 56:04.720
One way that you can encode information

56:04.720 --> 56:07.440
in quantum states of light is in the number of photons.

56:07.440 --> 56:09.320
You can have what are called number states

56:09.320 --> 56:11.960
and a number state will have a well-defined number

56:11.960 --> 56:16.400
of photons and maybe the output of your quantum computation

56:16.400 --> 56:19.760
encodes its information in the number of photons

56:19.760 --> 56:20.600
that are generated.

56:20.600 --> 56:23.040
So if you have a detector that is sensitive to that,

56:23.040 --> 56:24.280
it's extremely useful.

56:24.280 --> 56:29.240
Can you achieve like a clock with photons

56:29.240 --> 56:30.240
or is that not important?

56:30.240 --> 56:32.480
Is there a synchronicity here?

56:33.320 --> 56:35.440
In general, it can be important.

56:36.920 --> 56:39.440
Clock distribution is a big challenge

56:39.440 --> 56:43.320
in especially large computational systems.

56:43.320 --> 56:48.000
And so yes, optical clocks, optical clock distribution

56:48.000 --> 56:51.160
is a very powerful technology.

56:51.160 --> 56:53.220
I don't know the state of that field right now,

56:53.220 --> 56:55.680
but I imagine that if you're trying to distribute a clock

56:55.680 --> 56:59.000
across any appreciable size computational system,

56:59.200 --> 57:00.360
you wanna use light.

57:00.360 --> 57:04.320
Yeah, I wonder how these giant systems work,

57:04.320 --> 57:07.400
especially like supercomputers.

57:07.400 --> 57:09.400
Do they need to do clock distribution

57:09.400 --> 57:14.280
or are they doing more ad hoc parallel,

57:14.280 --> 57:15.520
like concurrent programming?

57:15.520 --> 57:18.160
Like there's some kind of locking mechanisms or something.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.320
That's a fascinating question,

57:19.320 --> 57:23.880
but let's zoom in at this very particular question

57:23.880 --> 57:28.200
of computation on a processor

57:28.200 --> 57:31.560
and communication between processors.

57:31.560 --> 57:36.440
So what does this system look like

57:36.440 --> 57:38.240
that you're envisioning,

57:38.240 --> 57:40.920
one of the places you're envisioning it is in the paper

57:40.920 --> 57:43.120
on optoelectronic intelligence.

57:43.120 --> 57:44.760
So what are we talking about?

57:44.760 --> 57:47.040
Are we talking about something that starts to look

57:47.040 --> 57:48.720
a lot like the human brain

57:48.720 --> 57:51.300
or does it still look a lot like a computer?

57:51.300 --> 57:52.960
What are the size of this thing?

57:52.960 --> 57:55.120
Is it going inside a smartphone or as you said,

57:55.120 --> 57:58.560
does it go inside something that's more like a house?

57:58.560 --> 58:01.160
Like, what should we be imagining?

58:01.160 --> 58:02.240
What are you thinking about

58:02.240 --> 58:05.480
when you're thinking about these fundamental systems?

58:05.480 --> 58:07.400
Let me introduce the word neuromorphic.

58:07.400 --> 58:09.960
There's this concept of neuromorphic computing

58:09.960 --> 58:13.080
where what that broadly refers to is

58:14.760 --> 58:17.720
computing based on the information processing principles

58:17.720 --> 58:19.240
of the brain.

58:19.240 --> 58:23.800
And as digital computing seems to be pushing

58:23.800 --> 58:26.480
towards some fundamental performance limits,

58:26.480 --> 58:29.180
people are considering architectural advances,

58:29.180 --> 58:30.880
drawing inspiration from the brain,

58:30.880 --> 58:32.800
more distributed parallel network

58:32.800 --> 58:34.240
kind of architectures and stuff.

58:34.240 --> 58:37.480
And so there's this continuum of neuromorphic

58:37.480 --> 58:42.480
from things that are pretty similar to digital computers,

58:42.760 --> 58:45.760
but maybe there are more cores

58:45.760 --> 58:49.200
and the way they send messages is a little bit more

58:49.200 --> 58:52.840
like the way brain neurons send spikes.

58:52.840 --> 58:56.120
But for the most part, it's still digital electronics.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.760
And then you have some things in between

58:58.760 --> 59:02.100
where maybe you're using transistors,

59:02.100 --> 59:03.240
but now you're starting to use them

59:03.240 --> 59:06.160
instead of in a digital way, in an analog way.

59:06.160 --> 59:08.180
And so you're trying to get those circuits

59:08.180 --> 59:10.320
to behave more like neurons.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.160
And then that's a little bit,

59:12.160 --> 59:14.960
quite a bit more on the neuromorphic side of things.

59:14.960 --> 59:17.080
You're trying to get your circuits,

59:17.080 --> 59:19.160
although they're still based on silicon,

59:19.160 --> 59:22.480
you're trying to get them to perform operations

59:22.480 --> 59:24.680
that are highly analogous to the operations in the brain.

59:24.680 --> 59:26.720
That's where a great deal of work is

59:26.720 --> 59:29.200
in neuromorphic computing people like Yacomo Ndoveri

59:29.200 --> 59:33.000
and Gert Cowenbergs, Jennifer Hasler, countless others.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.560
It's a rich and exciting field

59:35.560 --> 59:39.460
going back to Carver Mead in the late 1980s.

59:39.460 --> 59:43.360
And then all the way on the other extreme of the continuum

59:44.240 --> 59:49.240
is where you say, I'll give up anything related to transistors

59:50.020 --> 59:51.420
or semiconductors or anything like that.

59:52.100 --> 59:53.620
I'm not starting with the assumption

59:53.620 --> 59:55.140
that I'm gonna use any kind of

59:55.140 --> 59:57.260
conventional computing hardware.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.320
And instead, what I wanna do is try and understand

59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.700
what makes the brain powerful

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.180
at the kind of information processing it does.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.540
And I wanna think from first principles

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:10.540
about what hardware is best going to enable us

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.020
to capture those information processing principles

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.000
in an artificial system.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.420
And that's where I live.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.740
That's where I'm doing my exploration these days.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:25.820
So what are the first principles

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.980
of brain-like computation communication?

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.620
Right, yeah, this is so important.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:35.560
And I'm glad we booked 14 hours for this because-

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.300
I only have 13, I'm sorry.

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.540
Okay, so the brain is notoriously complicated.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.060
And I think that's an important part

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.340
of why it can do what it does.

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.720
But okay, let me try to break it down.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:54.620
Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said before,

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.120
they're sophisticated devices in and of themselves,

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.260
and synapses are too.

01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:03.080
They can change their state based on the activity,

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.920
so they adapt over time.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.020
That's crucial to the way the brain works.

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:09.400
They don't just adapt on one time scale,

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.500
they can adapt on myriad time scales

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.100
from the spacing between pulses,

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.700
the spacing between spikes that come from neurons

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:21.540
all the way to the age of the organism.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:28.100
Also relevant, perhaps, I think the most important thing

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.300
that's guided my thinking is the network structure

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.140
of the brain.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:33.980
So-

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.580
Which can also be adjusted on different scales.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.420
Yeah, absolutely, yes.

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.360
So you're changing the strength of contacts,

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.120
you're changing the spatial distribution of them.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.960
Although spatial distribution doesn't change that much

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.440
once you're a mature organism,

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.920
but that network structure is really crucial.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.420
So let me dwell on that for a second.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.000
You can't talk about the brain without emphasizing

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.900
that most of the neurons in the neocortex

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.880
or the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.120
that we think is most responsible for high level reasoning

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.120
and things like that,

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.440
those neurons make thousands of connections.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:15.600
So you have this network that is highly interconnected.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.920
And I think it's safe to say that one of the primary reasons

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.220
that they make so many different connections

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:26.920
is that allows information to be communicated very rapidly

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.460
from any spot in the network

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.360
to any other spot in the network.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.960
So that's a sort of spatial aspect of it.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:38.520
You can quantify this in terms of concepts

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.040
that are related to fractals and scale invariants,

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.280
which I think is a very beautiful concept.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.040
So what I mean by that is no matter what spatial scale

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.320
you're looking at in the brain within certain bounds,

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.960
you see the same general statistical pattern.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.320
So if I draw a box around some region of my cortex,

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.280
most of the connections that those neurons

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.480
within that box make are gonna be within the box

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.200
to each other in their local neighborhood.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.280
And that's sort of called clustering, loosely speaking.

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.960
But a non-negligible fraction

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.640
is gonna go outside of that box.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.100
And then if I draw a bigger box,

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.440
the pattern is gonna be exactly the same.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.420
So you have this scale invariance,

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.720
and you also have a non-vanishing probability

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:25.400
of a neuron making connection very far away.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.720
So suppose you wanna plot the probability

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.420
of a neuron making a connection as a function of distance.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.240
If that were an exponential function,

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.720
it would go e to the minus radius

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.700
over some characteristic radius,

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.860
and it would drop off up to some certain radius.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.920
The probability would be reasonably close to one,

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:49.140
and then beyond that characteristic length r zero,

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.340
it would drop off sharply.

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:53.580
And so that would mean that the neurons in your brain

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:58.580
are really localized, and that's not what we observe.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.700
Instead, what you see is that the probability

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.800
of making a longer distance connection, it does drop off,

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.800
but it drops off as a power law.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.460
So the probability that you're gonna have a connection

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:13.220
at some radius r goes as r to the minus some power.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.840
And that's more, that's what we see with forces in nature,

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.500
like the electromagnetic force

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.500
between two particles or gravity

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.020
goes as one over the radius squared.

01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:23.860
So-

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.680
You can see this in fractals.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.620
I love that there's like a fractal dynamics of the brain,

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.500
that if you zoom out, you draw the box,

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.060
and you increase that box by certain step sizes,

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.780
you're gonna see the same statistics.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:40.020
I think that's probably very important

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.900
to the way the brain processes information.

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.620
It's not just in the spatial domain,

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.660
it's also in the temporal domain.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.100
And what I mean by that is-

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:47.940
Poof!

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:50.660
That's incredible that this emerged

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.360
through the evolutionary process

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.940
that potentially somehow connected

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:57.820
to the way the physics of the universe works.

01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:59.380
Yeah, I couldn't agree more,

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:01.460
that it's a deep and fascinating subject

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:04.180
that I hope to be able to spend the rest of my life studying.

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.860
Do you think you need to solve,

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.420
understand this fractal nature

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:10.140
in order to understand intelligence

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.580
and communication? I do think so.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.340
I think they are deeply intertwined.

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:16.940
Yes, I think power laws are right at the heart of it.

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:19.220
So just to push that one through,

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.500
the same thing happens in the temporal domain.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.140
So suppose you had,

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.020
suppose your neurons in your brain

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.200
were always oscillating at the same frequency,

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.780
then the probability of finding a neuron

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:32.560
oscillating as a function of frequency

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.560
would be this narrowly peaked function

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.560
around that certain characteristic frequency.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.920
That's not at all what we see.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.280
The probability of finding neurons oscillating

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.920
or producing spikes at a certain frequency

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.240
is again a power law,

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.680
which means there's no defined scale

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.720
of the temporal activity in the brain.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:56.080
At what speed do your thoughts occur?

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.320
Well, there's a fastest speed they can occur

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.540
and that is limited by communication and other things,

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.980
but there's not a characteristic scale.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.900
We have thoughts on all temporal scales

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.860
from a few tens of milliseconds,

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.420
which is physiologically limited by our devices,

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.740
compare that to tens of picoseconds

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:17.180
that I talked about in superconductors,

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.300
all the way up to the lifetime of the organism.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.780
You can still think about things

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.620
that happened to you when you were a kid.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.100
Well, if you want to be really trippy,

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.900
then across multiple organisms

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.500
in the entirety of human civilization,

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.460
you have thoughts that span organisms, right?

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.260
Yes, taking it to that level, yes.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.660
If you're willing to see the entirety of the human species

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.260
as a single organism with a collective intelligence,

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.940
then that too on a spatial and temporal scale,

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.180
there's thoughts occurring.

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:44.100
And then if you look at not just the human species,

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.540
but the entirety of life on Earth

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.660
as an organism with thoughts that are occurring

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.680
that are greater and greater sophisticated thoughts,

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.740
there's a different spatial and temporal scale there.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.580
This is getting very suspicious.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.700
Hold on though, before we're done,

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.060
I just want to just tie the bow

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.380
and say that the spatial and temporal aspects

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:06.500
are intimately interrelated with each other.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.140
So activity between neurons

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.380
that are very close to each other

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.620
is more likely to happen on this faster time scale,

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.340
and information is gonna propagate

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.260
and encompass more of the brain,

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.340
more of your cortices, different modules in the brain

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.780
are gonna be engaged in information processing

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:25.340
on longer time scales.

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:28.020
So there's this concept of information integration

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:32.020
where neurons are specialized.

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:34.060
Any given neuron or any cluster of neuron

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.780
has its specific purpose,

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:39.940
but they're also very much integrated.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.940
So you have neurons that specialize

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.700
but share their information.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:47.620
And so that happens through these fractal nested oscillations

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.480
that occur across spatial and temporal scales.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.700
I think capturing those dynamics in hardware,

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.100
to me, that's the goal of neuromorphic computing.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.740
So does it need to look,

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.860
so first of all, that's fascinating.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:04.000
We stated some clear principles here.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.160
Now, does it have to look like the brain

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.860
outside of those principles as well?

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.340
Like what other characteristics

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.120
have to look like the human brain?

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.860
Or can it be something very different?

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.060
Well, it depends on what you're trying to use it for.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.780
And so I think a lot of the community

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.120
asks that question a lot.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.380
What are you gonna do with it?

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.660
And I completely get it.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:28.060
I think that's a very important question.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.880
And it's also sometimes not the most helpful question.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.820
What if what you wanna do with it is study it?

01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:38.540
What if you just wanna see what do you have to build

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.340
into your hardware in order to observe

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.900
these dynamical principles?

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:47.540
And also, I ask myself that question every day

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.900
and I'm not sure I'm able to answer that.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:51.260
It's like, what are you gonna do

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.540
with this particular neuromorphic machine?

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.340
So suppose what we're trying to do with it

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.980
is build something that thinks.

01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:59.160
We're not trying to get it to make us any money

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.700
or drive a car, maybe we'll be able to do that.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.620
But that's not our goal.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.280
Our goal is to see if we can get the same types

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.940
of behaviors that we observe in our own brain.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:10.500
And by behaviors, in this sense,

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:14.340
what I mean, the behaviors of the components,

01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.020
the neurons, the network, that kind of stuff.

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.420
I think there's another element

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.100
that I didn't really hit on

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:21.200
that you also have to build into this.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.940
And those are architectural principles.

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.180
They have to do with the hierarchical,

01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:27.380
modular construction of the network.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.180
And without getting too lost in jargon,

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.700
the main point that I think is relevant there.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.740
Let me try and illustrate it with a cartoon picture

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:38.220
of the architecture of the brain.

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.100
So in the brain, you have the cortex,

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.560
which is sort of this outer sheet.

01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.180
It's a layered structure.

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:48.460
If you could take it out of your brain,

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.660
you could unroll it on the table

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.820
and it would be about the size of a pizza.

01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:57.300
And that's a module.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:58.660
It does certain things.

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.700
It processes as Yorgi Buzaki would say,

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.460
it processes the what of what's going on around you.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.160
But you have another really crucial module

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.980
that's called the hippocampus.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.460
And that network is structured entirely differently.

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.780
First of all, this cortex that had described

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.540
10 billion neurons in there.

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.780
So numbers matter here.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.360
And they're organized in that sort of power law distribution

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.700
where the probability of making a connection drops off

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.260
as a power law in space.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.920
The hippocampus is another module

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.600
that's important for understanding where you are,

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:36.600
when you are, keeping track of your position

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.920
in space and time.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.980
And that network is very much random.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.720
So the probability of making a connection,

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.500
it almost doesn't even drop off as a function of distance.

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.480
It's the same probability that you'll make it here

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.800
to over there, but there are only

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.440
about 100 million neurons there.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:55.120
So you can have that huge, densely connected module

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.720
because it's not so big.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.480
And the neocortex or the cortex and the hippocampus,

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.360
they talk to each other constantly.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:08.360
And that communication is largely facilitated

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.160
by what's called the thalamus.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.320
I'm not a neuroscientist here.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.440
I'm trying to do my best to recite things.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.120
Cartoon picture of the brain, I gotcha.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.020
Yeah, something like that.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:19.080
So this thalamus is coordinating the activity

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.200
between the neocortex and the hippocampus

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.000
and making sure that they talk to each other

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.720
at the right time and send messages

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.280
that will be useful to one another.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.560
So this all taken together is called

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:32.040
the thalamocortical complex.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.320
And it seems like building something like that

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:39.120
is going to be crucial to capturing the types

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.840
of activity we're looking for because those responsibilities,

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.160
those separate modules, they do different things.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:51.160
So that's gotta be central to achieving these states

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:55.320
of efficient information integration across space and time.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.440
By the way, I am able to achieve this state

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.280
by watching simulations, visualizations

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.280
of the thalamocortical complex.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.920
There's a few people I forget from where.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.360
They've created these incredible visual illustrations

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:14.120
of like visual stimulation from the eye

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.720
or something like that in this image

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.560
flowing through the brain.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.080
Wow, I haven't seen that.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:20.920
I gotta check that out.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.160
So it's one of those things,

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.320
you find this stuff in the world

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.000
and you see like on YouTube, it has like 1,000 views.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.800
These visualizations of the human brain

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.560
processing information and like,

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.520
because there's chemistry there

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.920
because this is from actual human brains.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.760
I don't know how they're doing the coloring,

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.880
but they're able to actually trace

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.560
like different, the chemical

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.440
and the electrical signals throughout the brain

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.280
and the visual thing, it's like, whoa,

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.800
because it looks kind of like the universe.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.800
I mean, the whole thing is just incredible.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.080
I recommend it highly.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.640
I'll probably post a link to it,

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.960
but you can just look for one of the things they simulate

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.840
is the thalamocortical complex and just visualization.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.280
You can find that yourself on YouTube, but it's beautiful.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.120
The other question I have for you is,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.480
how does memory play into all of this?

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.160
Because all the signals sending back and forth,

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.920
that's kind of like, that's computation and communication,

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.000
but that's kind of like, you know,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.280
processing of inputs and outputs

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.600
to produce outputs in the system.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.040
That's kind of like maybe reasoning.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:30.960
Maybe there's some kind of recurrence,

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:33.160
but like, is there a storage mechanism

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.640
that you think about in the context

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.880
in neuromorphic computing?

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.720
Yeah, absolutely.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.800
So that's gotta be central.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.560
You have to have a way that you can store memories,

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.760
and there are a lot of different kinds of memory

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.600
in the brain.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.200
That's yet another example of how it's not a simple system.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.040
So there's one kind of memory,

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.800
one way of talking about memory

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.080
usually starts in the context of Hopfield networks.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.480
You were lucky to talk to John Hopfield on this program,

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.880
but the basic idea there is working memory

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:09.160
is stored in the dynamical patterns of activity

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.400
between neurons.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.760
And you can think of a certain pattern of activity

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:19.680
as an attractor, meaning if you put in some signal

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.040
that's similar enough to other previously experienced

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:27.800
signals like that, then you're going to converge

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.600
to the same network dynamics,

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.760
and you will see these neurons

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.240
participate in the same network patterns of activity

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.640
that they have in the past.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.760
So you can talk about the probability

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.560
that different inputs will allow you to converge

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.280
to different basins of attraction,

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.640
and you might think of that as,

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.040
oh, I saw this face,

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.960
and then I excited this network pattern of activity,

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.120
because last time I saw that face,

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.600
I was at some movie,

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.560
and that's a famous person that's on the screen

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.380
or something like that.

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.600
So that's one memory storage mechanism,

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.440
but crucial to the ability to imprint those memories

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.560
in your brain is the ability to change the strength

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.400
of connection between one neuron and another,

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.320
that synaptic connection between them.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.640
So synaptic weight update is a massive field

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.600
of neuroscience and neuromorphic computing as well.

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.600
So there are two poles to that on that spectrum.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.920
Okay, so more in the language of machine learning,

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.040
we would talk about supervised and unsupervised learning.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.020
And when I'm trying to tie that down

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.560
to neuromorphic computing,

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:38.520
I will use a definition of supervised learning,

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:43.040
which basically means the external user,

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.560
the person who's controlling this hardware,

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.400
has some knob that they can tune

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.480
to change each of the synaptic weights,

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.480
depending on whether or not the network's doing

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.600
what you want it to do.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.200
Whereas what I mean in this conversation,

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.680
when I say unsupervised learning,

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.480
is that those synaptic weights

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.160
are dynamically changing in your network

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.080
based on nothing that the user's doing,

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.140
nothing that there's no wire from the outside

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.120
going into any of those synapses.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.160
The network itself is reconfiguring those synaptic weights

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.820
based on physical properties

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:17.680
that you've built into the devices.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.460
So if the synapse receives a pulse from here,

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.440
and that causes the neuron to spike,

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.680
some circuit built in there

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.300
with no help from me or anybody else,

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:31.440
adjust the weight in a way that makes it more likely

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.640
to store the useful information

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.400
and excite the useful network patterns,

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.420
and makes it less likely that random noise,

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.500
useless communication events

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:45.360
will have an important effect on the network activity.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:48.320
So there's memory encoded in the weights,

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.840
the synaptic weights.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.920
What about the formation of something

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.720
that's not often done in machine learning,

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.320
the formation of new synaptic connections?

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.480
Right, well that seems to,

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.160
so again, not a neuroscientist here,

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.960
but my reading of the literature

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.040
is that that's particularly crucial

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.440
in early stages of brain development

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.200
where a newborn is born

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:11.720
with tons of extra synaptic connections,

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.920
and it's actually pruned over time.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.840
So the number of synapses decreases

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.720
as opposed to growing new long distance connections.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.320
It is possible in the brain to grow new neurons

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.120
and assign new synaptic connections,

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:29.160
but it doesn't seem to be the primary mechanism

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.880
by which the brain is learning.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.320
So for example, like right now,

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.760
sitting here talking to you,

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.060
you say lots of interesting things,

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:38.800
and I learn from you,

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.280
and I can remember things that you just said,

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.760
and I didn't grow new axonal connections

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.400
down to new synapses to enable those.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.200
It's plasticity mechanisms in the synaptic connections

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.000
between neurons that enable me to learn on that time scale.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.480
So at the very least,

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.920
that you can sufficiently approximate that

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.400
with just weight updates.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.000
You don't need to form new connections.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.120
I would say weight updates are a big part of it.

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.240
I also think there's more

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.640
because broadly speaking,

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.480
when we're doing machine learning,

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.520
our networks, say we're talking about feed forward,

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.160
deep neural networks,

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.000
the temporal domain is not really part of it.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.240
Okay, you're gonna put in an image

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.440
and you're gonna get out a classification,

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:22.040
and you're gonna do that as fast as possible.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.720
So you care about time,

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.600
but time is not part of the essence of this thing, really.

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:30.000
Whereas in spiking neural networks,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.720
what we see in the brain,

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.320
time is as crucial a space

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.960
and they're intimately intertwined as I've tried to say.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.960
And so adaptation on different time scales is important,

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.080
not just in memory formation,

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.340
although it plays a key role there,

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.220
but also in just keeping the activity

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.280
in a useful dynamic range.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.520
So you have other plasticity mechanisms,

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.240
not just weight update,

01:18:54.240 --> 01:18:56.800
or at least not on the time scale

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.800
of many action potentials,

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.200
but even on the shorter time scale.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:04.720
So a synapse can become much less efficacious.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.240
It can transmit a weaker signal

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:12.000
after the second, third, fourth action potential

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.080
to occur in a sequence.

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:15.980
So that's what's called short-term synaptic plasticity,

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.600
which is a form of learning.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.640
You're learning that I'm getting too much stimulus

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.680
from looking at something bright right now,

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:23.820
so I need to tone that down, you know?

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.080
There's also another really important mechanism

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.540
in learning that's called metaplasticity.

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:35.380
What that seems to be is a way that you change

01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:37.440
not the weights themselves,

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.300
but the rate at which the weights change.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.300
So when I am in, say, a lecture hall and my,

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:48.400
this is a potentially terrible cartoon example,

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:49.680
well, let's say I'm in a lecture hall

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.000
and it's time to learn, right?

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.320
So my brain will release more,

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.280
perhaps dopamine or some neuromodulator

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:00.360
that's gonna change the rate

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.300
at which synaptic plasticity occurs.

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:04.280
So that can make me more sensitive to learning

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.360
at certain times,

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.400
more sensitive to overriding previous information,

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.360
and less sensitive at other times.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.240
And finally, as long as I'm rattling off the list,

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.520
I think another concept that falls in the category

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.080
of learning or memory adaptation

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:22.440
is homeostasis or homeostatic adaptation

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.960
where neurons have the ability

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.800
to control their firing rate.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.240
So if one neuron is just like blasting way too much,

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.320
it will naturally tone itself down.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:37.440
Its threshold will adjust so that it stays

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.540
in a useful dynamical range.

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:41.720
And we see that that's captured in deep neural networks

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.340
where you don't just change the synaptic weights,

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:44.840
but you can also move the thresholds

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.600
of simple neurons in those models.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:52.600
And so to achieve the spike in neural networks,

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.440
you want to use, like,

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.240
you want to implement the first principles

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.440
that you mentioned of the temporal

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:07.040
and the spatial fractal dynamics here.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.280
So you can communicate locally,

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:13.340
you can communicate across much greater distances

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:16.020
and do the same thing in space

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:18.060
and do the same thing in time.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:21.060
Now, you have like a chapter called

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:24.380
Superconducting Hardware for Neuromorphic Computing.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.780
So what are some ideas that integrate

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:29.120
some of the things we've been talking about

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.100
in terms of the first principles of neuromorphic computing

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.300
and the ideas that you outline

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:38.080
in optoelectronic intelligence?

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.960
Yeah, so let me start, I guess,

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:42.540
on the communication side of things,

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:46.300
because that's what led us down this track

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:47.140
in the first place.

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:51.900
By us, I'm talking about my team of colleagues at NIST,

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.820
you know, Saeed Han, Bryce Primavera, Sonia Buckley,

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.220
Jeff Chiles, Adam McCaughan, to name,

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:58.740
Alex Tate to name a few,

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:01.260
our group leaders, Sebu Nam and Rich Mirren.

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.500
We've all contributed to this.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.540
So this is not me saying necessarily just the things

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.580
that I've proposed, but sort of where our team's thinking

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.540
has evolved over the years.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.660
Can I quickly ask, what is NIST

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:18.060
and where is this amazing group of people located?

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.660
NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:26.660
The larger facility is out in Gaithersburg, Maryland.

01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:29.700
Our team is located in Boulder, Colorado.

01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:36.220
NIST is a federal agency under the Department of Commerce.

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.180
We do a lot with, by we, I mean other people at NIST,

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:42.660
do a lot with standards, you know,

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:46.140
making sure that we understand the system of units,

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:49.340
international system of units, precision measurements.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:53.580
There's a lot going on in electrical engineering,

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:54.780
material science.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.740
And it's historic.

01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:57.580
I mean, it's like, it's one of those,

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.100
it's like MIT or something like that.

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.980
It has a reputation over many decades

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:04.260
of just being this really a place

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:05.340
where there's a lot of really,

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.660
people have done a lot of amazing things.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.620
In terms of the people in your team,

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:12.740
in this team of people involved

01:23:12.740 --> 01:23:14.580
in the concept we're talking about now,

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.460
I'm just curious,

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:17.260
what kind of disciplines are we talking about?

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:18.100
What is it?

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:20.260
Mostly physicists and electrical engineers,

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.900
some material scientists.

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:25.060
But I would say, yeah,

01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.220
I think physicists and electrical engineers,

01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.460
my background is in photonics,

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.020
the use of light for technology.

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:33.340
So coming from there,

01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:36.820
I tend to have found colleagues

01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.260
that are more from that background,

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.260
although Adam McCaughan,

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.700
more of a superconducting electronics background.

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.300
We need a diversity of folks.

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.860
This project is sort of cross-disciplinary.

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.300
I would love to be working more

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.780
with neuroscientists and things,

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:53.900
but we haven't reached that scale yet.

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:54.740
But yeah.

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.460
You're focused on the hardware side,

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:59.180
which requires all the disciplines that you mentioned.

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.020
And then of course,

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.140
you know, science may be a source of inspiration

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:04.380
for some of the long-term vision.

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.220
I would actually call it more than inspiration.

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:11.100
I would call it sort of a roadmap, you know?

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:15.020
We're not trying to build exactly the brain,

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.500
but I don't think it's enough to just say,

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.220
oh, neurons kind of work like that.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.740
Let's kind of do that thing.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:25.340
I mean, we're very much following the concepts

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:27.420
that the cognitive sciences have laid out for us,

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:30.500
which I believe is a really robust roadmap.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.060
I mean, just on a little bit of a tangent,

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:36.100
it's often stated that we just don't understand the brain

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:37.980
and so it's really hard to replicate it

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.220
because we just don't know what's going on there.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.580
And maybe five or seven years ago,

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.780
I would have said that,

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.860
but as I got more interested in the subject,

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:50.500
I read more of the neuroscience literature

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.620
and I was just taken by the exact opposite sense.

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.860
I can't believe how much they know about this.

01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:59.300
I can't believe how mathematically rigorous

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:02.940
and sort of theoretically complete

01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:04.220
a lot of the concepts are.

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:06.660
That's not to say we understand consciousness

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.540
or we understand the self or anything like that,

01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:11.020
but what is the brain doing

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:13.580
and why is it doing those things?

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.980
Neuroscientists have a lot of answers to those questions.

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:17.820
So if you're a hardware designer

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.420
that just wants to get going,

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.980
whoa, it's pretty clear which direction to go in, I think.

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:27.980
Okay, so I love the optimism behind that,

01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:31.140
but any implementation of these systems

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:37.140
that uses super connectivity, how do you make it happen?

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.860
So to me, it starts with thinking

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.380
about the communication network.

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:47.500
You know for sure that the ability of each neuron

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.500
to communicate to many thousands of colleagues

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.300
across the network is indispensable.

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.220
I take that as a core principle of my architecture,

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.420
my thinking on the subject.

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:02.300
Coming from a background in photonics,

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.620
it was very natural to say,

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:05.380
okay, we're gonna use light for communication.

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:08.780
Just in case listeners may not know,

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.860
light is often used in communication.

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.740
I mean, if you think about radio, that's light,

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:15.340
it's long wavelengths, but it's electromagnetic radiation.

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.660
It's the same physical phenomenon

01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:20.220
obeying exactly the same Maxwell's equations.

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:24.940
And then all the way down to fiber, fiber optics.

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.460
Now you're using visible or near infrared wavelengths

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.380
of light, but the way you send messages across the ocean

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:33.220
is now contemporary over optical fibers.

01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:37.500
So using light for communication is not a stretch.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:38.980
It makes perfect sense.

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:41.540
So you might ask, well, why don't you use light

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:45.300
for communication in a conventional microchip?

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.460
And the answer to that is, I believe, physical.

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:53.100
If we had a light source on a silicon chip

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.900
that was as simple as a transistor,

01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.260
there would not be a processor in the world

01:26:58.260 --> 01:26:59.780
that didn't use light for communication,

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:01.820
at least above some distance.

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:04.060
How many light sources are needed?

01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:06.860
Oh, you need a light source at every single point.

01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:08.460
A light source per neuron.

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:09.980
Per neuron, per little,

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.100
but then if you could have a really small

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.100
and nice light source,

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.980
your definition of neuron could be flexible.

01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:19.220
Could be, yes, yes.

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.740
Sometimes it's helpful to me to say,

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.580
in this hardware, a neuron is that entity

01:27:24.580 --> 01:27:25.820
which has a light source.

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:27.980
And I can explain.

01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:29.780
And then there was light.

01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:32.260
I can explain more about that, but.

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:34.660
Somehow this rhymes with consciousness

01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:38.260
because people will often say the light of consciousness.

01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:41.660
So that consciousness is that which is conscious.

01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.500
I got it.

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:44.820
That's not my quote.

01:27:44.820 --> 01:27:46.940
That's me, that's my quote.

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.460
You see, that quote comes from my background.

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:53.580
Yours is in optics, mine in light, mine's in darkness.

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:57.580
Go ahead, what were you saying?

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.540
The point I was making there is that

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:02.900
if it was easy to manufacture light sources

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:05.700
along with transistors on a silicon chip,

01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:07.180
they would be everywhere.

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.820
And it's not easy.

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:10.100
People have been trying for decades

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.900
and it's actually extremely difficult.

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.660
I think an important part of our research

01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:17.340
is dwelling right at that spot there.

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.780
Is it physics or engineering that makes it difficult?

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.900
It's physics.

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:22.220
Okay, so it's physics, I think.

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.380
So what I mean by that is,

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:28.500
as we discussed, silicon is the material of choice

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:33.260
for transistors and it's very difficult to imagine

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.220
that that's gonna change anytime soon.

01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:39.140
Silicon is notoriously bad at emitting light

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:43.300
and that has to do with the immutable properties

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:44.180
of silicon itself.

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:47.900
The way that the energy bands are structured in silicon,

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:50.500
you're never going to make silicon efficient

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.500
as a light source at room temperature

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:55.660
without doing very exotic things

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.340
that degrade its ability to interface nicely

01:28:58.340 --> 01:28:59.860
with those transistors in the first place.

01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:02.620
So that's like one of these things where it's,

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:05.220
why is nature dealing us that blow?

01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:07.060
You give us these beautiful transistors

01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:08.660
and you give us all the motivation

01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.180
to use light for communication,

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:11.580
but then you don't give us a light source.

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.060
So, well, okay, you do give us a light source,

01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.380
compound semiconductors.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.940
Like we talked about back at the beginning,

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:19.700
an element from group three and an element from group five

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.860
form an alloy where every other lattice site

01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:23.700
switches which element it is.

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:27.260
Those have much better properties for generating light.

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:30.060
You put electrons in, light comes out.

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:33.140
Almost 100% of the electron hold,

01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:35.220
it can be made efficient.

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.460
Okay, I'll take your word for it, okay.

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:39.620
However, I say it's physics not engineering

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:43.180
because it's very difficult to get those

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:45.260
compound semiconductor light sources

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:47.580
situated with your silicon.

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.460
In order to do that ion implantation

01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:50.820
that I talked about at the beginning,

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:52.780
high temperatures are required.

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.740
So you gotta make all of your transistors first

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:58.620
and then put the compound semiconductors on top of there.

01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:00.900
You can't grow them afterwards

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.420
because that requires high temperature.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:04.100
It screws up all your transistors.

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:05.860
You try and stick them on there.

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:08.020
They don't have the same lattice constant.

01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:10.400
The spacing between atoms is different enough

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.700
that it just doesn't work.

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:15.580
So nature does not seem to be telling us that,

01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:18.020
hey, go ahead and combine light sources

01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.980
with your digital switches

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.700
for conventional digital computing.

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.740
And conventional digital computing

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:27.660
will often require smaller scale, I guess,

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.580
in terms of smartphone.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:35.460
So in which kind of systems does nature hint

01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:40.460
that we can use light and photons for communication?

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.580
Well, so let me just try and be clear.

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:46.860
You can use light for communication in digital systems.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:50.340
The light sources are not intimately integrated

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:51.340
with the silicon.

01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.700
You manufacture all the silicon,

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.340
you have your microchip, plunk it down.

01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:57.300
And then you manufacture your light sources,

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.340
separate chip, completely different process,

01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.060
made in a different foundry.

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.800
And then you put those together at the package level.

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:08.580
So now you have some, I would say a great deal

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:12.420
of architectural limitations that are introduced

01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:15.980
by that sort of package level integration

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:18.580
as opposed to monolithic on the same chip integration.

01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:20.180
But it's still a very useful thing to do.

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:23.700
And that's where I had done some work previously

01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.660
before I came to NIST.

01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:28.460
There's a project led by Vladimir Stoyanovich

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:31.380
that now spun out into a company called IR Labs

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:33.760
led by Mark Wade and Chen Sun,

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.020
where they're doing exactly that.

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:36.980
So you have your light source chip,

01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:39.820
your silicon chip, whatever it may be doing.

01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:40.940
Maybe it's digital electronics,

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:43.660
maybe it's some other control purpose, something.

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:47.800
And the silicon chip drives the light source chip

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.780
and modulates the intensity of the light.

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:52.620
So you can get data out of the package on an optical fiber.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:56.600
And that still gives you tremendous advantages in bandwidth

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:58.860
as opposed to sending those signals out

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.800
over electrical lines.

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.200
But it is somewhat peculiar to my eye

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.940
that they have to be integrated at this package level.

01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:09.820
And those people, I mean, they're so smart.

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:12.920
Those are my colleagues that I respect a great deal.

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:15.620
So it's very clear that it's not just,

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.800
they're making a bad choice.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.520
This is what physics is telling us.

01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.320
It just wouldn't make any sense

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:24.280
to try to stick them together.

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:26.540
Yeah, so even if it's difficult,

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.920
it's easier than the alternative, unfortunately.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:31.760
I think so, yes.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.320
And again, I need to go back

01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:35.120
and make sure that I've not taken the wrong way.

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.840
I'm not saying that the pursuit

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.440
of integrating compound semiconductors with silicon

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.180
is fruitless and shouldn't be pursued.

01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:42.020
It should.

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:43.460
I mean, people are doing great work.

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:45.780
Kai Mei Lau and John Bowers, others,

01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:48.260
they're doing it and they're making progress.

01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:50.540
But to my eye, it doesn't look like

01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:55.540
that's ever going to be just the standard

01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.640
monolithic light source on silicon process.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.060
I just don't see it.

01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.900
Yeah, so nature kinda points the way usually.

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.500
And if you resist nature,

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.700
you're gonna have to do a lot more work.

01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:07.740
And it's gonna be expensive and not scalable.

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.580
Got it.

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:11.340
But okay, so let's go like far into the future.

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:14.780
Let's imagine this gigantic neuromorphic computing system

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:17.380
that simulates all of our realities.

01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.100
It currently is Mantra Matrix 4.

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:24.100
So this thing, this powerful computer, how does it operate?

01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:27.560
So what are the neurons?

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.080
What is the communication?

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.040
What's your sense?

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.500
All right, so let me now,

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.760
after spending 45 minutes trashing

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.180
light source integration with silicon,

01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:40.180
let me now say why I'm basing my entire life,

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:43.700
professional life on integrating light sources

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:44.960
with electronics.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.020
I think the game is completely different

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:49.580
when you're talking about superconducting electronics.

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:54.260
For several reasons, let me try to go through them.

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:56.460
One is that, as I mentioned,

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:58.580
it's difficult to integrate those compounds,

01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:01.300
semiconductor light sources with silicon.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:04.780
With silicon is a requirement that is introduced

01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:07.260
by the fact that using semiconducting electronics.

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:08.840
In superconducting electronics,

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.880
you're still gonna start with a silicon wafer,

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.080
but it's just the bread for your sandwich

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:13.920
in a lot of ways.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.840
You're not using that silicon

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.760
in precisely the same way for the electronics.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.500
You're now depositing superconducting materials

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:21.860
on top of that.

01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:24.560
The prospects for integrating light sources

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:27.440
with that kind of an electronic process

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.500
are certainly less explored,

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:31.960
but I think much more promising

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.300
because you don't need those light sources

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.600
to be intimately integrated with the transistors.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.940
That's where the problems come up.

01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:39.940
They don't need to be lattice matched to the silicon,

01:34:39.940 --> 01:34:41.180
all that kind of stuff.

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:43.640
Instead, it seems possible

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:45.100
that you can take those compounds,

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.320
semiconductor light sources,

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.180
stick them on the silicon wafer,

01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:51.420
and then grow your superconducting electronics

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.320
on the top of that.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.820
It's at least not obviously going to fail.

01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:57.300
So the computation would be done

01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:00.380
on the superconductive material as well?

01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:01.980
Yes, the computation is done

01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.940
in the superconducting electronics,

01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:06.420
and the light sources receive signals

01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:08.220
that say, hey, a neuron reached threshold,

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:09.820
produce a pulse of light,

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:12.460
send it out to all your downstream synaptic connections.

01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:16.220
Those are, again, superconducting electronics.

01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.980
Perform your computation,

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:19.620
and you're off to the races.

01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:20.740
Your network works.

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:22.620
So then if we can rewind real quick,

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:25.140
so what are the limitations

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:28.900
of the challenges of superconducting electronics

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:31.480
when we think about constructing these kinds of systems?

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:34.820
So actually, let me say

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.580
one other thing about the light sources,

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.860
and then I'll move on, I promise,

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.340
because this is probably tedious for some.

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:44.060
This is super exciting.

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:45.780
Okay, one other thing about the light sources.

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:48.940
I said that silicon is terrible at emitting photons.

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.700
It's just not what it's meant to do.

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.860
However, the game is different

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.100
when you're at low temperature.

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:55.740
If you're working with superconductors,

01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:57.020
you have to be at low temperature

01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:58.740
because they don't work otherwise.

01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:00.300
When you're at four Kelvin,

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:03.460
silicon is not obviously a terrible light source.

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:05.900
It's still not as efficient as compound semiconductors,

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:08.700
but it might be good enough for this application.

01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:10.580
The final thing that I'll mention about that is,

01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:12.780
again, leveraging superconductors,

01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.420
as I said, in a different context,

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:19.560
superconducting detectors can receive one single photon.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:21.280
In that conversation, I failed to mention

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.500
that semiconductors can also receive photons.

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:26.260
That's the primary mechanism by which it's done.

01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:29.460
A camera in your phone that's receptive to visible light

01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:31.140
is receiving photons.

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:32.260
It's based on silicon,

01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:34.420
or you can make it in different semiconductors

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.620
for different wavelengths,

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:39.660
but it requires on the order of a thousand,

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:43.620
a few thousand photons to receive a pulse.

01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.180
Now, when you're using a superconducting detector,

01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.380
you need one photon, exactly one.

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:50.900
I mean, one or more.

01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:54.020
So the fact that your synapses

01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:56.700
can now be based on superconducting detectors

01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:58.820
instead of semiconducting detectors

01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:00.740
brings the light levels that are required

01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.180
down by some three orders of magnitude.

01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:06.580
So now, you don't need good light sources.

01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.820
You can have the world's worst light sources

01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:11.860
as long as they spit out maybe a few thousand photons

01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:13.820
every time a neuron fires.

01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.660
You have the hardware principles in place

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:19.660
that you might be able to perform

01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:21.740
this optoelectronic integration.

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:25.060
To me, optoelectronic integration, it's just so enticing.

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:28.700
We want to be able to leverage electronics for computation,

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:30.420
light for communication,

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:32.860
working with silicon microelectronics at room temperature

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:35.060
that has been exceedingly difficult.

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:40.020
And I hope that when we move to the superconducting domain,

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.860
target a different application space

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:44.940
that is neuromorphic instead of digital,

01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:47.700
and use superconducting detectors,

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:50.140
maybe optoelectronic integration comes to us.

01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:51.780
Okay, so there's a bunch of questions.

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:53.700
So one is temperature.

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:58.380
So in these kind of hybrid heterogeneous systems,

01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.580
what's the temperature?

01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:01.820
What are some of the constraints to the operation here?

01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:03.620
Does it all have to be at four Kelvin as well?

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:04.460
Four Kelvin.

01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:06.860
Everything has to be at four Kelvin.

01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:09.740
Okay, so what are the other engineering challenges

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:14.340
of making this kind of optoelectronic systems?

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.580
Let me just dwell on that four Kelvin for a second,

01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.300
because some people hear four Kelvin

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:19.300
and they just get up and leave.

01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:21.540
They just say, I'm not doing it, you know?

01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.380
And to me, that's very earth-centric, species-centric.

01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.260
We live in 300 Kelvin,

01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:29.140
so we want our technologies to operate there too.

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.100
I totally get it.

01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:31.900
Yeah, what's zero Celsius?

01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:34.540
Zero Celsius is 273 Kelvin.

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:37.620
So we're talking very, very cold here.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.460
This is-

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:39.620
Not even Boston cold.

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:40.460
No.

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:42.420
This is real cold.

01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:43.260
Yeah.

01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.080
This is Siberia cold.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:44.920
No.

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.020
Okay, so just for reference,

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:47.900
the temperature of the cosmic microwave background

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.380
is about 2.7 Kelvin.

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.700
So we're still warmer than deep space.

01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:52.980
Yeah, good.

01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.540
So that when the universe dies out,

01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:57.980
it'll be colder than 4K.

01:38:57.980 --> 01:38:59.420
It's already colder than 4K.

01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:04.220
In the expanses, you don't have to get that far away

01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:06.980
from the earth in order to drop down

01:39:06.980 --> 01:39:07.820
to not far from 4K.

01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.860
So what you're saying is the aliens that live

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:13.320
at the edge of the observable universe

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.460
are using superconductive material for their computation.

01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:17.900
They don't have to live at the edge of the universe.

01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:21.060
The aliens that are more advanced than us

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:24.540
in their solar system are doing this

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.580
in their asteroid belt.

01:39:26.580 --> 01:39:27.820
We can get to that.

01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:31.700
Oh, because they can get to that temperature easier there?

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:32.540
Sure, yeah.

01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:34.180
All you have to do is reflect the sunlight away

01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:36.100
and you have a huge head start.

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.700
Oh, so the sun is the problem here.

01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:39.040
Like it's warm here on earth.

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:39.880
Got it.

01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:40.700
Yeah.

01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:42.940
Okay, so how do we get to 4K?

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:43.780
What's-

01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:46.940
Well, okay, so what I wanna say about temperature

01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:50.660
is that if you're in the sun,

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:52.620
if you can swallow that,

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:56.220
if you can say, all right, I give up applications

01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:58.220
that have to do with my cell phone

01:39:58.220 --> 01:40:02.060
and the convenience of a laptop on a train

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.340
and you instead, for me,

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:06.460
I'm very much in the scientific head space.

01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:07.980
I'm not looking at products.

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:09.920
I'm not looking at what this will be useful

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.040
to sell to consumers.

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:13.420
Instead, I'm thinking about scientific questions.

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:16.580
Well, it's just not that bad to have to work at 4K.

01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:18.980
We do it all the time in our labs at NIST

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:21.420
and so does, I mean, for reference,

01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:25.580
the entire quantum computing sector

01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:27.340
usually has to work at something

01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.660
like 100 millikelvin, 50 millikelvin.

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:31.660
So now you're talking of another factor

01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:35.140
of 100 even colder than that, a fraction of a degree

01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:37.380
and everybody seems to think quantum computing

01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:39.180
is gonna take over the world.

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:41.620
It's so much more expensive to have to get

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:46.620
that extra factor of 10 or whatever colder

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.620
and yet it's not stopping people

01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:51.140
from investing in that area and by investing,

01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:54.300
I mean, putting their research into it as well

01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.220
as venture capital or whatever, so.

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:59.620
Oh, so based on the energy of what you're commenting on,

01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.980
I'm getting a sense that's one of the criticism

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:06.740
of this approach is 4K, 4K is a big negative.

01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:10.700
It is the showstopper for a lot of people.

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.900
They just, I mean, and understandably,

01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:16.860
I'm not saying that that's not a consideration.

01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:17.820
Of course it is.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:20.460
For some, okay, so different motivations

01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:21.420
for different people.

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:24.380
In the academic world, suppose you spent your whole life

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:26.740
learning about silicon microelectronic circuits,

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:30.500
you send a design to a foundry, they send you back a chip

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:32.980
and you go test it at your tabletop

01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.660
and now I'm saying, here, now learn how to use

01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:38.420
all these cryogenics so you can do that at 4K.

01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:41.180
No, come on, man, I don't wanna do that.

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.020
That sounds bad.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.540
It's the old momentum, the Titanic of the turning.

01:41:44.540 --> 01:41:45.660
Yeah, kind of.

01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:48.380
But you're saying that's not too much of a,

01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:50.380
when we're looking at large systems

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:52.380
and the gain you can potentially get from them,

01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:53.460
that's not that much of a cost.

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:55.180
And when you wanna answer the scientific question

01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:58.180
about what are the physical limits of cognition,

01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:00.500
well, the physical limits, they don't care

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:03.780
if you're at 4K, if you can perform cognition

01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:06.140
at a scale orders of magnitude beyond

01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:07.700
any room temperature technology,

01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:10.460
but you gotta get cold to do it, you're gonna do it.

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:14.620
And to me, that's the interesting application space.

01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.140
It's not even an application space.

01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:18.980
That's the interesting scientific paradigm.

01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:22.580
So I personally am not going to let low temperature

01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:27.580
stop me from realizing a technological domain or realm

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:33.820
that is achieving in most ways everything else

01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:36.180
that I'm looking for in my hardware.

01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:37.660
So that, okay, that's a big one.

01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:40.020
Is there other kind of engineering challenges

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:40.860
that you envision?

01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:41.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:43.140
So let me take a moment here

01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.780
because I haven't really described what I mean

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:49.020
by a neuron or a network in this particular hardware.

01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:51.660
Yeah, do you wanna talk about loop neurons

01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:53.700
and there's so many fascinating ideas,

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.940
but you just have so many amazing papers

01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:57.700
that people should definitely check out

01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:59.860
and the titles alone are just killer.

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:01.100
So anyway, go ahead.

01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:06.020
Right, so let me say big picture based on optics,

01:43:06.020 --> 01:43:07.740
photonics for communication,

01:43:07.780 --> 01:43:10.180
superconducting electronics for computation.

01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:11.540
How does this all work?

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:16.540
So a neuron in this hardware platform

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:19.580
can be thought of as circuits

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:21.140
that are based on Joseph's injunctions,

01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:22.740
like we talked about before,

01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:25.340
where every time a photon comes in,

01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:27.140
so let's start by talking about a synapse.

01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:29.740
A synapse receives a photon, one or more,

01:43:29.740 --> 01:43:31.420
from a different neuron

01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:35.380
and it converts that optical signal to an electrical signal.

01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:38.980
The amount of current that that adds to a loop

01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:40.860
is controlled by the synaptic weight.

01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:42.380
So as I said before,

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.540
you're popping fluxons into a loop, right?

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.460
So a photon comes in,

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:49.220
it hits a superconducting single photon detector,

01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:52.140
one photon, the absolute physical minimum

01:43:52.140 --> 01:43:54.020
that you can communicate from one place to another

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:54.860
with light.

01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:56.140
And that detector then converts that

01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:57.420
into an electrical signal

01:43:57.420 --> 01:43:58.740
and the amount of the signal

01:43:58.740 --> 01:44:01.220
is correlated with some kind of weight.

01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.980
Yeah, so the synaptic weight will tell you

01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:05.500
how many fluxons you pop into the loop.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:06.620
It's an analog number,

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.180
we're doing analog computation now.

01:44:08.180 --> 01:44:09.780
Well, can you just linger on that?

01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:11.020
What the heck is a fluxon?

01:44:11.020 --> 01:44:11.980
Are we supposed to know this?

01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:14.260
Or is this a funny,

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:15.620
is this like the Big Bang?

01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:18.860
Is this a funny word for something deeply technical?

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:21.100
No, let's try to avoid using the word fluxon

01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:23.020
because it's not actually necessary.

01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:24.420
When a photon-

01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.540
It's fun to say though,

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:29.060
so it's very necessary, I would say.

01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:31.260
When a photon hits that superconducting

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:32.940
single photon detector,

01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:36.580
current is added to a superconducting loop

01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.220
and the amount of current that you add

01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.380
is an analog value,

01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:43.020
can have eight bit equivalent resolution,

01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:45.460
something like that, 10 bits maybe.

01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:46.980
That's amazing, by the way.

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.540
This is starting to make a lot more sense.

01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:50.660
When you're using superconductors for this,

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:54.740
the energy of that circulating current

01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:58.660
is less than the energy of that photon.

01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:01.780
So your energy budget is not destroyed

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:04.020
by doing this analog computation.

01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:07.100
So now in the language of a neuroscientist,

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.220
you would say that's your postsynaptic signal.

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.740
You have this current being stored in a loop.

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.540
You can decide what you wanna do with it.

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:16.180
Most likely you're gonna have it decay exponentially.

01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:18.940
So every single synapse is gonna have

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.020
some given time constant.

01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:25.420
And that's determined by putting some resistor

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:27.100
in that superconducting loop.

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:31.140
So a synapse event occurs when a photon strikes a detector,

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.900
adds current to that loop, it decays over time.

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:35.580
That's the postsynaptic signal.

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:38.460
Then you can process that in a dendritic tree.

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:41.100
Bryce Primavera and I have a paper

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:43.460
that we've submitted about that.

01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.420
For the more neuroscience-oriented people,

01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:47.100
there's a lot of dendritic processing,

01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:49.500
a lot of plasticity mechanisms you can implement

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.500
with essentially exactly the same circuits.

01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:54.500
You have this one simple building block circuit

01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:57.300
that you can use for a synapse, for a dendrite,

01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:00.340
for the neuron cell body, for all the plasticity functions.

01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:02.380
It's all based on the same building block,

01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:03.780
just tweaking a couple parameters.

01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.980
So this basic building block has both an optical

01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:07.300
and an electrical component,

01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:11.700
and then you can just build arbitrary large systems with that.

01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:14.060
Close, you're not at fault for thinking

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:15.460
that that's what I meant.

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:18.820
What I should say is that if you want it to be a synapse,

01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:21.260
you tack a detector, a superconducting detector,

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:22.260
onto the front of it.

01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:23.500
And if you want it to be anything else,

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.340
there's no optical component.

01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.160
Got it.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:31.160
So it's the front optics and the front electrical stuff

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:32.600
in the back.

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.120
Electrical, yeah, in the processing

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.480
and in the output signal that it sends

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.400
to the next stage of processing further.

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:41.520
So the dendritic trees is electrical.

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.480
It's all electrical.

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.880
It's all electrical in the superconducting domain.

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.560
For anybody who's up on their superconducting circuits,

01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:52.440
it's just based on a DC squid, the most ubiquitous,

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.160
which is a circuit composed of two Josephson junctions.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.720
So it's a very bread and butter kind of thing.

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.940
And then the only place where you go beyond that

01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:03.060
is the neuron cell body itself.

01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:05.340
It's receiving all these electrical inputs

01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:06.880
from the synapses or dendrites

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.880
or however you've structured that particular unique neuron.

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:12.360
And when it reaches its threshold,

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.400
which occurs by driving a Josephson junction

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.780
above its critical current,

01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:17.240
it produces a pulse of current

01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.500
which starts an amplification sequence,

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.420
voltage amplification,

01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:24.520
that produces light out of a transmitter.

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.920
So one of our colleagues, Adam McCaughan

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.700
and Sonja Buckley as well did a lot of work

01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:33.080
on the light sources and the amplifiers

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:36.920
that drive the current and produce sufficient voltage

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:39.200
to drive current through that now semiconducting part.

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:43.200
So that light source is the semiconducting part of a neuron.

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:45.660
And so the neuron has reached threshold.

01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:47.680
It produces a pulse of light.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:51.600
That light then fans out across a network of waveguides

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.520
to reach all the downstream synaptic terminals

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:57.320
that perform this process themselves.

01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:59.860
So it's probably worth explaining

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:02.320
what a network of waveguides is

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.780
because a lot of listeners aren't gonna know that.

01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:07.120
Look up the papers by Jeff Chiles on this one.

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:11.380
But basically light can be guided in a simple,

01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:14.880
basically wire of usually an insulating material.

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.240
So silicon, silicon nitride,

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:20.000
different kinds of glass,

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.400
just like in a fiber optic, it's glass, silicon dioxide.

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.800
That makes it a little bit big.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.120
We wanna bring these down

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:28.000
so we use different materials like silicon nitride.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.960
But basically just imagine a rectangle of some material

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.560
that just goes and branches,

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.960
forms different branch points

01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:43.040
that target different sub regions of the network.

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.960
You can transition between layers of these.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.120
So now we're talking about building in the third dimension

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.820
which is absolutely crucial.

01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.700
So that's what waveguides are.

01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:52.460
Yeah, that's great.

01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:54.660
Why the third dimension is crucial?

01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.820
Okay, so yes.

01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:56.660
You were talking about

01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:58.660
what are some of the technical limitations.

01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:04.260
One of the things that I believe we have to grapple with

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:08.760
is that our brains are miraculously compact.

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.540
For the number of neurons that are in our brain,

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:13.500
it sure does fit in a small volume,

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:14.340
as it would have to

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:16.180
if we're gonna be biological organisms

01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:19.220
that are resource limited and things like that.

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.940
Any kind of hardware neuron

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.420
is almost certainly gonna be much bigger than that

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:26.420
if it is of comparable complexity.

01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:28.500
Whether it's based on silicon transistors,

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.700
okay, a transistor, seven nanometers,

01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:33.700
that doesn't mean a semiconductor based neuron

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:34.900
is seven nanometers.

01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:35.740
They're big.

01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:38.740
They require many transistors,

01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:40.260
different other things like capacitors

01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:41.540
and things that store charge.

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:44.660
They end up being on the order of 100 microns

01:49:44.660 --> 01:49:45.900
by 100 microns,

01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:48.260
and it's difficult to get them down any smaller than that.

01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.900
The same is true for superconducting neurons,

01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:52.140
and the same is true

01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:54.060
if we're trying to use light for communication.

01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.900
Even if you're using electrons for communication,

01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:00.100
you have these wires where,

01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:03.400
okay, the size of an electron might be angstroms,

01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.580
but the size of a wire is not angstroms,

01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:07.180
and if you try and make it narrower,

01:50:07.180 --> 01:50:08.540
the resistance just goes up,

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:10.780
so you don't actually win.

01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:12.380
To communicate over long distances,

01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:15.660
you need your wires to be microns wide,

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:17.180
and it's the same thing for waveguides.

01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:18.940
Waveguides are essentially limited

01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:20.300
by the wavelength of light,

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.900
and that's gonna be about a micron,

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:24.700
so whereas compare that to an axon,

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:26.780
the analogous component in the brain,

01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:31.100
which is 10 nanometers in diameter, something like that,

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.660
they're bigger when they need to communicate

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.620
over long distances,

01:50:34.620 --> 01:50:37.980
but grappling with the size of these structures

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:39.820
is inevitable and crucial,

01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:44.820
and so in order to make systems of comparable scale

01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.860
to the human brain, by scale here,

01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:49.820
I mean number of interconnected neurons,

01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:53.640
you absolutely have to be using the third spatial dimension,

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:55.940
and that means on the wafer,

01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.380
you need multiple layers

01:50:57.380 --> 01:50:59.580
of both active and passive components.

01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:03.380
Active, I mean superconducting electronic circuits

01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:05.380
that are performing computations,

01:51:05.380 --> 01:51:07.380
and passive, I mean these waveguides

01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:08.800
that are routing the optical signals

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.120
to different places,

01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.720
you have to be able to stack those.

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.720
If you can get to something like 10 planes

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:16.160
of each of those, or maybe not even 10,

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.840
maybe five, six, something like that,

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:19.760
then you're in business.

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:22.860
Now you can get millions of neurons on a wafer,

01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:26.380
but that's not anywhere close to the brain scale.

01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.960
In order to get to the scale of the human brain,

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:30.000
you're gonna have to also use the third dimension

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.560
in the sense that entire wafers

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:34.160
need to be stacked on top of each other

01:51:34.160 --> 01:51:36.080
with fiber optic communication between them,

01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:38.640
and we need to be able to fill a space

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.040
the size of this table with stacked wafers,

01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:44.280
and that's when you can get to some 10 billion neurons

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:45.120
like your human brain,

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:46.680
and I don't think that's specific

01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:48.800
to the optoelectronic approach that we're taking.

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:51.400
I think that applies to any hardware

01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:53.560
where you're trying to reach commensurate scale

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.000
and complexity as the human brain.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.520
So you need that fractal stacking,

01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:01.120
so stacking on the wafer, and stacking of the wafers,

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.800
and then whatever the system that combine,

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:06.360
this stacking of the tables with the wafers.

01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:07.700
And it has to be fractal all the way,

01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:08.580
you're exactly right,

01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:10.060
because that's the only way

01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:12.500
that you can efficiently get information

01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:15.060
from a small point to across that whole network.

01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:17.540
It has to have the power law connected.

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:20.620
And photons are like optics throughout.

01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:21.460
Yeah, absolutely.

01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:23.680
Once you're at this scale, to me it's just obvious.

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:25.580
Of course you're using light for communication.

01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:30.580
You have fiber optics given to us from nature so simple.

01:52:31.980 --> 01:52:33.860
The thought of even trying to do

01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:37.100
any kind of electrical communication just doesn't.

01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:38.060
It doesn't make sense to me.

01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:39.300
I'm not saying it's wrong.

01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:41.780
I don't know, but that's where I'm coming from.

01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:44.780
So let's return to loop neurons.

01:52:44.780 --> 01:52:47.340
Why are they called loop neurons?

01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:49.740
Yeah, the term loop neurons comes from the fact,

01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:50.860
like we've been talking about,

01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:54.100
that they rely heavily on these superconducting loops.

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:58.300
So even in a lot of forms of digital computing

01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:01.980
with superconductors, storing a signal

01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:05.900
in a superconducting loop is a primary technique.

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.460
In this particular case,

01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.420
it's just loops everywhere you look.

01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:12.420
So the strength of a synaptic weight

01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:15.940
is gonna be set by the amount of current circulating

01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:18.620
in a loop that is coupled to the synapse.

01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:23.300
So memory is implemented as current circulating

01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:24.900
in a superconducting loop.

01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:27.960
The coupling between, say, a synapse in a dendrite

01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:29.940
or a synapse in the neuron cell body

01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:33.860
occurs through loop coupling through transformer.

01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:35.560
So current circulating in a synapse

01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:38.320
is gonna induce current in a different loop,

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:41.520
a receiving loop in the neuron cell body.

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:45.200
So since all of the computation is happening

01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:47.280
in these flux storage loops,

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:49.120
and they play such a central role

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:51.000
in how the information is processed,

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.560
how memories are formed, all that stuff,

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.720
I didn't think too much about it.

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:56.280
I just called them loop neurons

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.200
because it rolls off the tongue a little bit better

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:01.220
than superconducting optoelectronic neurons.

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:07.220
Okay, so how do you design circuits for these loop neurons?

01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:09.740
That's a great question.

01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:12.340
There's a lot of different scales of design.

01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:16.360
So at the level of just one synapse,

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:19.740
you can use conventional methods.

01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.340
They're not that complicated

01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.220
as far as superconducting electronics goes.

01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:27.100
It's just four Josephson junctions or something like that,

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:29.180
depending on how much complexity you wanna add.

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:34.180
So you can just directly simulate each component in SPICE.

01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:35.860
What's SPICE?

01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:39.260
It's standard electrical simulation software, basically.

01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:42.580
So you're just explicitly solving the differential equations

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:44.340
that describe the circuit elements.

01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:46.220
And then you can stack these things together

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:48.860
in that simulation software to then build circuits.

01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:51.580
You can, but that becomes computationally expensive.

01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:54.100
So one of the things when COVID hit,

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.780
we knew we had to turn some attention

01:54:55.780 --> 01:54:59.380
to more things you can do at home in your basement

01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:02.700
or whatever, and one of them was computational modeling.

01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:07.700
So we started working on adapting,

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:10.180
abstracting out the circuit performance

01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:12.540
so that you don't have to explicitly solve

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.860
the circuit equations, which for Josephson junctions

01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:18.480
usually needs to be done on like a picosecond time scale.

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:21.220
And you have a lot of nodes in your circuit.

01:55:21.220 --> 01:55:24.820
So it results in a lot of differential equations

01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:26.340
that need to be solved simultaneously.

01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:29.420
We were looking for a way to simulate these circuits

01:55:29.420 --> 01:55:33.740
that is scalable up to networks of millions or so neurons

01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:36.620
is sort of where we're targeting right now.

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:40.820
So we were able to analyze the behavior of these circuits.

01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:43.620
And as I said, it's based on these simple building blocks.

01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:46.340
So you really only need to understand this one building block.

01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:48.980
And if you get a good model of that, boom, it tiles.

01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:51.140
And you can change the parameters in there

01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:52.840
to get different behaviors and stuff,

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:56.200
but it's all based on now it's one differential equation

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:57.120
that you need to solve.

01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.780
So one differential equation for every synapse,

01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:03.740
dendrite or neuron in your system.

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:05.360
And for the neuroscientists out there,

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:08.440
it's just a simple leaky integrated FHIR model,

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.960
leaky integrator, basically that a synapse

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:13.460
is a leaky integrator, a dendrite is a leaky integrator.

01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:18.460
So I'm really fascinated by how this one simple component

01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:22.240
can be used to achieve lots of different types

01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.480
of dynamical activity.

01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:27.560
And to me, that's where scalability comes from

01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.240
and also complexity as well.

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:33.840
Complexity is often characterized by relatively simple

01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:37.880
building blocks connected in potentially simple

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.400
or sometimes complicated ways,

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:42.000
and then emergent new behavior that was hard to predict

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.720
from those simple elements.

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:46.680
And that's exactly what we're working with here.

01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:49.080
So it's a very exciting platform,

01:56:49.080 --> 01:56:50.400
both from a modeling perspective

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.780
and from a hardware manifestation perspective

01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:57.400
where we can hopefully start to have this test bed

01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:58.880
where we can explore things,

01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:00.840
not just related to neuroscience,

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:04.480
but also related to other things that connected

01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:07.160
to other physics like critical phenomenon,

01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:08.680
Ising models, things like that.

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:13.080
So you were asking how we simulate these circuits.

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:14.560
It's at different levels.

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:18.360
And we've got the simple SPICE circuit stuff.

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:19.580
That's no problem.

01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:21.780
And now we're building these network models

01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:23.660
based on this more efficient leaky integrator.

01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:26.260
So we can actually reduce every element

01:57:26.260 --> 01:57:27.500
to one differential equation.

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:28.900
And then we can also step through it

01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.740
on a much coarser time grid.

01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:32.420
So it ends up being something like a factor

01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:35.420
of a thousand to 10,000 speed improvement,

01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:37.780
which allows us to simulate,

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:40.540
but hopefully up to millions of neurons.

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:44.700
Whereas before we would have been limited to tens,

01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:45.820
a hundred, something like that.

01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:48.860
And just like simulating quantum mechanical systems

01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:49.900
with a quantum computer.

01:57:49.900 --> 01:57:53.420
So the goal here is to understand such systems.

01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:55.940
For me, the goal is to study this

01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:58.980
as a scientific physical system.

01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:01.980
I'm not drawn towards turning this

01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:03.500
into an enterprise at this point.

01:58:03.500 --> 01:58:04.340
I feel-

01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:05.860
So short-term applications

01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:07.500
that obviously make a lot of money

01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:10.540
is not necessarily a curiosity driver

01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:11.420
for you at the moment.

01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:12.260
Absolutely not.

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:14.060
If you're interested in short-term making money,

01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:16.540
go with deep learning, use silicon microelectronics.

01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:20.900
If you want to understand things like the physics

01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:23.060
of a fascinating system,

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:26.260
or if you want to understand something more along the lines

01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:29.500
of the physical limits of what can be achieved,

01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:32.720
then I think single photon communication,

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:35.980
superconducting electronics is extremely exciting.

01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:39.660
What if I want to use superconducting hardware

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:42.060
at four Kelvin to mine Bitcoin?

01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:43.300
That's my main interest.

01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:45.900
That's the reason I wanted to talk to you today.

01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:47.660
No, I don't know.

01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:48.660
What's Bitcoin?

01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:52.540
Look it up.

01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:54.780
On the internet, somebody told me about it.

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:56.380
I'm not sure exactly what it is.

01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:59.060
But let me ask, nevertheless,

01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:01.500
about applications to machine learning.

01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:02.340
Okay.

01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:07.460
If you look at the scale of five, 10, 20 years,

01:59:07.460 --> 01:59:10.180
is it possible to,

01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:13.180
before we understand the nature of human intelligence

01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:14.620
and general intelligence,

01:59:14.620 --> 01:59:19.260
do you think we'll start falling out of this exploration

01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:23.260
of neuromorphic systems' ability to solve some

01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:25.380
of the problems that the machine learning systems

01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:26.580
of today can't solve?

01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:31.540
I'm really hesitant to over promise.

01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:34.140
So I really don't know.

01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:36.780
Also, I don't really understand machine learning

01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:37.600
in a lot of senses.

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:42.480
I mean, machine learning, from my perspective,

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:47.440
appears to require that you know precisely

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:51.720
what your input is and also what your goal is.

01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:53.360
You usually have some objective function

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:54.200
or something like that.

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:57.320
And that's just, that's very limiting.

01:59:57.320 --> 02:00:00.200
I mean, of course, a lot of times that's the case.

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.120
You know, there's a picture and there's a horse in it.

02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:03.960
So you're done.

02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:06.520
But that's not a very interesting problem.

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:09.520
I think when I think about intelligence,

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:13.200
it's almost defined by the ability to handle problems

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.960
where you don't know what your inputs are going to be

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.400
and you don't even necessarily know

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:18.600
what you're trying to accomplish.

02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:21.640
I mean, I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish

02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:22.560
in this world.

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:24.560
Yeah, at all scales.

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:25.920
Yeah, at all scales, right.

02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:29.400
I mean, so sometimes, so I'm more drawn

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:33.720
to the underlying phenomena,

02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.960
the critical dynamics of this system,

02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:41.920
trying to understand how elements that you build

02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:46.920
into your hardware result in emergent fascinating activity

02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:51.720
that was very difficult to predict, things like that.

02:00:51.720 --> 02:00:53.600
So, but I gotta be really careful

02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.520
because I think a lot of other people who,

02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:57.640
if they found themselves working on this project

02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:58.960
in my shoes, they would say,

02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:00.920
all right, what are all the different ways

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.440
we can use this for machine learning?

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:04.880
Actually, let me just definitely mention

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:06.600
colleague at NIST, Mike Schneider.

02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:09.320
He's also very much interested,

02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:11.680
particularly in the superconducting side of things,

02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:14.880
using the incredible speed, power efficiency,

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:18.120
also Ken Seagal at Colgate, other people working on

02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:20.480
specifically the superconducting side of this

02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:25.040
for machine learning and deep feed-forward neural networks.

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:27.360
There, the advantages are obvious.

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:28.760
It's extremely fast.

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:31.840
Yeah, so that's less on the nature of intelligence

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:35.720
and more on various characteristics of this hardware.

02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:39.680
You can use for the basic computations we know today

02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:40.640
and communication.

02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:42.880
One of the things that Mike Schneider's working on right now

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:46.120
is an image classifier at a relatively small scale.

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:48.320
I think he's targeting that nine pixel problem

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.040
where you can have three different characters

02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:54.200
and you just, you put in a nine pixel image

02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:58.400
and you classify it as one of these three categories.

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.120
And that's gonna be really interesting

02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:01.240
to see what happens there

02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.680
because if you can show that even at that scale,

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:08.200
you just put these images in and you get it out

02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:09.560
and he thinks he can do it.

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:11.200
I forgot if it's a nanosecond

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:14.040
or some extremely fast classification time.

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:14.880
It's probably less.

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.400
It's probably a hundred picoseconds or something.

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:18.840
There, you have challenges though

02:02:18.840 --> 02:02:21.600
because the Josephson junctions themselves,

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:24.560
the electronic circuit is extremely power efficient.

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.880
Some orders of magnitude for something more

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:29.280
than a transistor doing the same thing.

02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:31.480
But when you have to cool it down to four Kelvin,

02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.900
you pay a huge overhead just for keeping it cold,

02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:35.280
even if it's not doing anything.

02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:40.280
So it has to work at large scale

02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:43.680
in order to overcome that power penalty,

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:45.120
but that's possible.

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:48.000
It's just, it's gonna have to get that performance.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:49.720
And this is sort of what you were asking about before

02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:52.760
is like how much better than silicon would it need to be?

02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:54.120
And the answer is, I don't know.

02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:57.240
I think if it's just overall better than silicon

02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:00.200
at a problem that a lot of people care about,

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:02.640
maybe it's image classification,

02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:03.960
maybe it's facial recognition,

02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:07.520
maybe it's monitoring credit transactions, I don't know,

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.000
then I think it will have a place.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.440
It's not gonna be in your cell phone,

02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:12.240
but it could be in your data center.

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:16.160
So what about in terms of the data center?

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:17.680
I don't know if you're paying attention

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.680
to the various systems like Tesla recently announced Dojo,

02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:27.160
which is a large scale machine learning training system

02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:28.940
that again, the bottleneck there

02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:32.800
is probably going to be communication between those systems.

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:34.920
Is there something from your work

02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:38.760
on everything we've been talking about

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.680
in terms of superconductive hardware

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.560
that could be useful there?

02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:45.400
Oh, I mean, okay.

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:46.760
Tomorrow, no.

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:49.040
In the long term, it could be the whole thing.

02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:49.880
It could be nothing.

02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:52.160
I don't know, but definitely, definitely.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:55.200
When you look at the,

02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:56.760
so I don't know that much about Dojo.

02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.880
My understanding is that that's new, right?

02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:01.360
That's just coming online.

02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:06.360
Well, I don't even know where it hasn't come online.

02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.560
And when you announce big, sexy,

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:13.200
so let me explain to you the way things work in the world.

02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:15.720
In the world of business and marketing,

02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:18.440
it's not always clear where you are

02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:20.600
on the coming online part of that.

02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:22.720
So I don't know where they are exactly,

02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:26.440
but the vision is from ground up to build

02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:31.120
a very, very large scale modular machine learning ASIC.

02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:32.680
Basically hardware that's optimized

02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:34.160
for training neural networks.

02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:36.120
And of course, there's a lot of companies

02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:39.400
that are small and big working on this kind of problem.

02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:42.720
The question is how to do it in a modular way

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:45.680
that has very fast communication.

02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:49.560
The interesting aspect of Tesla is you have a company

02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:54.560
that at least at this time is so singularly focused

02:04:54.680 --> 02:04:57.760
on solving a particular machine learning problem

02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:00.920
and is making obviously a lot of money doing so

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:03.320
because the machine learning problem happens to be involved

02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:05.240
with autonomous driving.

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:09.800
So you have a system that's driven by an application.

02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:14.800
And that's really interesting because you have maybe Google

02:05:15.080 --> 02:05:17.760
working on TPUs and so on.

02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.480
You have all these other companies with ASICs.

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:26.000
They're usually more kind of always thinking general.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.200
So I like it when it's driven by a particular application

02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:32.200
because then you can really get to the,

02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:36.280
it's like, it's somehow if you just talk broadly

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:39.360
about intelligence, you may not always get

02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:40.280
to the right solutions.

02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.720
It's nice to couple that sometimes with specific

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:46.720
clear illustration of something that requires

02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:48.240
general intelligence, which for me,

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.880
driving is one such case.

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:51.080
I think you're exactly right.

02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:54.360
Sometimes just having that focus on that application

02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:57.640
brings a lot of people, focuses their energy and attention.

02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:00.240
I think that, so one of the things that's appealing

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:03.280
about what you're saying is not just that the application

02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:06.080
is specific, but also that the scale is big

02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:10.120
and that the benefit is also huge.

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:10.960
So-

02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:12.320
Financial anti-humanity.

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.160
Right, right, right.

02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:15.520
Yeah, so I guess let me just try to understand

02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:20.040
is the point of this dojo system to figure out

02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:23.880
the parameters that then plug into neural networks

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:26.760
and then you don't need to retrain,

02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:29.120
you just make copies of a certain chip

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:32.360
that has all the parameters established or-

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:36.800
No, it's straight up retraining a large neural network

02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:38.600
over and over and over.

02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:41.680
So you have to do it once for every new car?

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:44.440
No, no, no, you have to, so they do this interesting

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:47.040
process, which I think is a process for machine learning,

02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:49.280
supervised machine learning systems,

02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:53.720
you're going to have to do, which is you have a system,

02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:56.440
you train your network once, it takes a long time,

02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:59.720
I don't know how long, but maybe a week to train,

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:05.040
and then you deploy it on, let's say about a million cars,

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:05.880
I don't know what the number is.

02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:08.320
But that part, you just write software that updates

02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.600
some weights in a table and yeah, okay.

02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:12.560
But there's a loop back.

02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:13.400
Yeah, yeah, okay.

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:17.360
Each of those cars run into trouble rarely,

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:23.800
but they catch the edge cases of the performance

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:28.280
of that particular system and then send that data back,

02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:31.440
and either automatically or by humans,

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:34.760
that weird edge case data is annotated,

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:37.520
and then the network has to become smart enough

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:40.120
to now be able to perform in those edge cases,

02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.800
so it has to get retrained.

02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:43.960
There's clever ways of retraining different parts

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:46.240
of that network, but for the most part,

02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:49.280
I think they prefer to retrain the entire thing.

02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:53.440
So you have this giant monster that kind of has to be

02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:54.880
retrained regularly.

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:59.880
I think the vision with Dojo is to have a very large

02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:05.200
machine learning-focused, driving-focused supercomputer

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:08.440
that then is sufficiently modular that can be scaled

02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:11.040
to other machine learning applications,

02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:12.720
so they're not limiting themselves completely

02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:14.000
to this particular application,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.440
but this application is the way they kind of test

02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:20.400
this iterative process of machine learning.

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:25.120
You make a system that's very dumb, deploy it,

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:27.120
get the edge cases where it fails,

02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:29.960
make it a little smarter, it becomes a little less dumb,

02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:32.960
and that iterative process achieves something

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:36.120
that you can call intelligent or is smart enough

02:08:36.120 --> 02:08:37.920
to be able to solve this particular application,

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:42.920
so it has to do with training your own networks fast

02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:45.880
and training your own networks that are large.

02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:48.520
But also based on an extraordinary amount

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:49.880
of diverse input.

02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:50.800
Data, yeah.

02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:51.920
And that's one of the things.

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:54.520
So this does seem like one of those spaces

02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:58.920
where the scale of superconducting optoelectronics,

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:02.520
the way that, so when you talk about the weaknesses,

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.160
like I said, okay, well, you have to cool it down.

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:08.240
At this scale, that's fine, because that's not too much

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.440
of an added cost.

02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:11.600
Most of your power's being dissipated by the circuits

02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:12.960
themselves, not the cooling.

02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:17.960
And also, you have one centralized kind of cognitive hub,

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.960
if you will, and so if we're talking about putting

02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:28.640
a superconducting system in a car, that's questionable.

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.680
Do you really wanna cryostat in the trunk

02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:31.520
of everyone in your car?

02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:32.880
It'll fit, it's not that big of a deal,

02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:35.720
but hopefully there's a better way, right?

02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:39.040
But since this is sort of a central supreme intelligence

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:42.600
or something like that, and it needs to really have

02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:47.080
this massive data acquisition, massive data integration,

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.520
I would think that that's where large-scale spiking

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:51.240
neural networks with vast communication

02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:53.120
and all these things would have something

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:54.240
pretty tremendous to offer.

02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:55.720
It's not gonna happen tomorrow.

02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:58.240
There's a lot of development that needs to be done,

02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:01.400
but we have to be patient with self-driving cars

02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:02.240
for a lot of reasons.

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:04.560
We were all optimistic that they would be here by now,

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:07.920
and okay, they are to some extent, but if we're thinking

02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:12.040
five or 10 years down the line, it's not unreasonable.

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.480
One other thing, let me just mention that getting

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:17.360
into self-driving cars and technologies

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:19.680
that are using AI out in the world,

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:21.520
this is something NIST cares a lot about.

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:25.040
Elham Tabassi is leading up a much larger effort

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.320
in AI at NIST than my little project,

02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:33.480
and really central to that mission is this concept

02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:35.000
of trustworthiness.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.920
So when you're going to deploy this neural network

02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:43.320
in every single automobile with so much on the line,

02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:45.240
you have to be able to trust that.

02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:48.040
How do we know that we can trust that?

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.080
How do we know that we can trust the self-driving car

02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:53.720
or the supercomputer that trained it?

02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:56.040
There's a lot of work there, and there's a lot of that

02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:58.200
going on at NIST, and it's still early days.

02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:00.520
I mean, you're familiar with the...

02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:01.360
Yeah, yeah.

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:02.200
...the development and all that.

02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:04.440
But there's a fascinating dance in engineering

02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:06.680
with safety-critical systems.

02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:08.840
There's a desire in computer science,

02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:10.640
just recently talked to Don Knuth,

02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.840
to do for algorithms and for systems,

02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.480
for them to be provably correct or provably safe,

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:21.120
and this is one other difference between humans

02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:24.320
and biological systems, is we're not provably anything.

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:25.160
Right, right.

02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:29.800
And so there's some aspect of imperfection

02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.400
that we need to have built in, like robustness

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:37.960
to imperfection be part of our systems,

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:40.600
which is a difficult thing for engineers to contend

02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:44.160
because they're very uncomfortable with the idea

02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:48.040
that you have to be okay with failure

02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:50.880
and almost engineer failure into the system.

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:54.120
Mathematicians hate it too, but I think it was Turing

02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:56.040
who said something along the lines of,

02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:58.200
I can give you an intelligent system

02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:00.720
or I can give you a flawless system,

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:02.040
but I can't give you both.

02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:05.280
And it's in sort of creativity and abstract thinking

02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:08.920
seem to rely somewhat on stochasticity

02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:11.960
not having components that perform

02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:13.800
exactly the same way every time.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:16.080
This is where the disagreement I have with,

02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:18.640
not disagreement, but a different view on the world.

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:23.640
I'm with Turing, when I talk to robotic robot colleagues,

02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:26.520
that sounds like I'm talking to robots,

02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:31.520
colleagues that are roboticists, the goal is perfection.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.680
And to me is like, no, I think the goal should be

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:41.000
the imperfection that's communicated

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.200
and through the interaction between humans and robots,

02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:49.200
that imperfection becomes a feature, not a bug.

02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:52.200
Like together, seen as a system,

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:53.720
the human and the robot together

02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:56.400
are better than either of them individually,

02:12:56.400 --> 02:13:00.560
but the robot itself is not perfect in any way.

02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:02.800
Of course, there's had a bunch of disagreements,

02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:04.960
including with Mr. Elon about,

02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:08.680
to me, autonomous driving is fundamentally

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:12.360
a human robot interaction problem, not a robotics problem.

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:14.360
To Elon, it's a robotics problem.

02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:18.600
That's actually an open and fascinating question,

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:21.680
whether humans can be removed from the loop completely.

02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:27.680
We've talked about a lot of fascinating chemistry

02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:31.240
and physics and engineering,

02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:33.680
and we're always running up against this issue

02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:37.560
that nature seems to dictate what's easy and what's hard.

02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:40.080
So you have this cool little paper

02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:42.760
that I'd love to just ask you about.

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.960
It's titled, Does Cosmological Evolution

02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:48.160
Select for Technology?

02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:53.160
So in physics, there's parameters

02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:56.200
that seem to define the way our universe works,

02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:59.320
that physics works, that if it worked any differently,

02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:01.720
we would get a very different world.

02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:04.240
So it seems like the parameters are very fine-tuned

02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:06.520
to the kind of physics that we see.

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:08.600
All the beautiful E equals MC squared

02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:10.480
that would get these nice, beautiful laws.

02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:13.200
It seems like very fine-tuned for that.

02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:16.000
So what you argue in this article

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000
is it may be that the universe

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.440
has also fine-tuned its parameters

02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:26.160
that enable the kind of technological innovation

02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:30.040
that we see, that technology that we see.

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:31.560
Can you explain this idea?

02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:33.840
Yeah, I think you've introduced it nicely.

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:38.840
Let me just try to say a few things in my language.

02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:41.680
Leah, what is this fine-tuning problem?

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:45.400
So physicists have spent centuries

02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:49.160
trying to understand the system of equations

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:51.640
that govern the way nature behaves,

02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:55.120
the way particles move and interact with each other.

02:14:55.120 --> 02:15:00.120
And as that understanding has become more clear over time,

02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:05.760
it became sort of evident that it's all well-adjusted

02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:12.640
to allow a universe like we see, very complex,

02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:16.480
this large, long-lived universe.

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:19.920
And so one answer to that is, well, of course it is

02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:21.520
because we wouldn't be here otherwise.

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:24.400
But I don't know, that's not very satisfying.

02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:27.200
That's what's known as the weak anthropic principle.

02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.200
It's a statement of selection bias.

02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:30.640
We can only observe a universe

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:33.640
that is fit for us to live in.

02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:34.960
So what does it mean for a universe

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.120
to be fit for us to live in?

02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:38.400
Well, the pursuit of physics,

02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:42.600
it is based partially on coming up with equations

02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:44.640
that describe how things behave

02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:46.280
and interact with each other.

02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:48.480
But in all those equations you have,

02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:49.960
so there's the form of the equation,

02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:54.200
sort of how different fields or particles

02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.480
move in space and time.

02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:58.480
But then there are also the parameters

02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:01.120
that just tell you sort of the strength

02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:02.840
of different couplings.

02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:05.520
How strongly does a charged particle couple

02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:07.600
to the electromagnetic field or masses?

02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:11.480
How strongly does a particle couple to the Higgs field

02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:12.960
or something like that?

02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:16.960
And those parameters that define,

02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:19.760
not the general structure of the equations,

02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:23.560
but the relative importance of different terms,

02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:25.200
they seem to be every bit as important

02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:27.720
as the structure of the equations themselves.

02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:29.440
And so I forget who it was,

02:16:29.440 --> 02:16:31.240
somebody when they were working through this

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:34.040
and trying to see, okay, if I adjust the parameter,

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:35.280
this parameter over here, call it the,

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:36.800
say the fine structure constant,

02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:37.960
which tells us the strength

02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:40.440
of the electromagnetic interaction.

02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:42.360
Oh boy, I can't change it very much,

02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:43.760
otherwise nothing works.

02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:45.400
The universe sort of doesn't,

02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.280
it just pops into existence and goes away

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:48.920
in a nanosecond or something like that.

02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:51.080
And somebody had the phrase,

02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:52.960
this looks like a put-up job,

02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:57.080
meaning every one of these parameters was dialed in.

02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:00.680
It's arguable how precisely they have to be dialed in,

02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:02.720
but dialed in to some extent,

02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:05.360
not just in order to enable our existence,

02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.120
that's a very anthropocentric view,

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:10.000
but to enable a universe like this one.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.040
So, okay, maybe I think the majority position

02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:17.040
of working physicists in the field is,

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:18.960
it has to be that way in order for us to exist.

02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:20.400
We're here, we shouldn't be surprised

02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:22.800
that that's the way the universe is.

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:24.520
And I don't know, for a while,

02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:26.120
that never sat well with me,

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:28.080
but I just kind of moved on

02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:29.480
because there are things to do,

02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:31.200
and a lot of exciting work

02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:33.800
doesn't depend on resolving this puzzle.

02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:38.800
But as I started working more with technology,

02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:41.840
getting into the more recent years of my career,

02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:43.760
particularly when I started,

02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:46.560
after having worked with silicon for a long time,

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:49.040
which was kind of eerie on its own,

02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:51.120
but then when I switched over to superconductor,

02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:53.600
I was just like, this is crazy.

02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:57.400
It's just absolutely astonishing

02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:00.600
that our universe gives us superconductivity.

02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:02.480
It's one of the most beautiful physical phenomena,

02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:06.600
and it's also extraordinarily useful for technology.

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:08.720
So you can argue that the universe has to have

02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:11.320
the parameters it does for us to exist

02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:13.040
because we couldn't be here otherwise.

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:14.800
But why does it give us technology?

02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:18.880
Why does it give us silicon that has this ideal oxide

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:20.920
that allows us to make a transistor

02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:22.520
without trying that hard?

02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.800
That can't be explained by the same anthropic reasoning.

02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:30.400
Yeah, so it's asking the why question.

02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:34.720
I mean, a slight natural extension of that question is,

02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:39.440
I wonder if the parameters were different

02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:44.280
if we would simply have just another set of paint brushes

02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:46.920
to create totally other things

02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:49.280
that wouldn't look like anything

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:50.960
like the technology of today,

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:54.560
but would nevertheless have incredible complexity,

02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:57.200
which is if you sort of zoom out and start defining things,

02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:01.480
not by how many batteries it needs

02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:03.640
and whether it can make toast,

02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:06.480
but more like how much complexity is within the system

02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:07.320
or something like that.

02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:08.160
Right, right.

02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:10.080
Well, yeah, you can start to quantify things.

02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:10.920
You're exactly right.

02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:13.800
So nowhere am I arguing that

02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:15.880
in all of the vast parameter space

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:18.080
of everything that could conceivably exist

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.720
in the multiverse of nature,

02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:23.320
there's this one point in parameter space

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:25.160
where complexity arises.

02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:26.680
I doubt it.

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:31.160
That would be a shameful waste of resources, it seems.

02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:34.720
But it might be that we reside at one place

02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:38.480
in parameter space that has been adapted

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:40.080
through an evolutionary process

02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:43.480
to allow us to make certain technologies

02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:47.120
that allow our particular kind of universe to arise

02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:49.800
and sort of achieve the things it does.

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:52.760
See, I wonder if nature in this kind of discussion,

02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:55.760
if nature is a catalyst for innovation

02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:57.720
or if it's a ceiling for innovation.

02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:00.840
So like, is it going to always limit us?

02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:04.040
Like what you're talking about silicon,

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:06.680
is it just make it super easy to do awesome stuff

02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:08.040
in a certain dimension,

02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:10.280
but we could still do awesome stuff in other ways.

02:20:10.280 --> 02:20:11.600
It'll just be harder.

02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:15.400
Or does it really set like the maximum we can do?

02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.880
That's a good thing to,

02:20:17.880 --> 02:20:19.440
that's a good subject to discuss.

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:23.160
I feel like we need to lay a little bit more groundwork.

02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:24.800
So I want to make sure that

02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:29.280
I introduce this in the context

02:20:29.280 --> 02:20:31.760
of Lee Smolin's previous idea.

02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:35.640
So who's Lee Smolin and what kind of ideas does he have?

02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:39.040
Okay, Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist

02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:41.800
who back in the late 1980s

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.960
published a paper in the early 1990s

02:20:43.960 --> 02:20:47.040
introduced this idea of cosmological natural selection,

02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:51.440
which argues that the universe did evolve.

02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:54.480
So his paper was called, did the universe evolve?

02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:59.480
And I gave myself the liberty of titling my paper,

02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:01.440
does cosmological selection

02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:03.960
or does cosmological evolution select for technology

02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:05.000
in reference to that.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:08.200
So he introduced that idea decades ago.

02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:12.200
Now he primarily works on quantum gravity,

02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:13.240
loop quantum gravity,

02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:18.040
other approaches to unifying quantum mechanics

02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:19.320
with general relativity,

02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:22.360
as you can read about in his most recent book, I believe,

02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:24.320
and he's been on your show as well.

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:27.800
So, but I want to introduce this idea

02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:29.400
of cosmological natural selection,

02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:32.680
because I think that is one of the core ideas

02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:35.360
that could change our understanding

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:37.840
of how the universe got here, our role in it,

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:39.880
what technology is doing here.

02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:41.280
But there's a couple more pieces

02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:42.360
that need to be set up first.

02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:44.240
So the beginning of our universe

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:47.280
is largely accepted to be the big bang.

02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:49.840
And what that means is if you look back in time

02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:52.520
by looking far away in space,

02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:56.880
you see that everything used to be at one point

02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:58.840
and it expanded away from there.

02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:02.600
There was an era in the evolutionary process

02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:05.440
of our universe that was called inflation.

02:22:05.440 --> 02:22:08.840
And this idea was developed primarily by Alan Guth

02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:13.120
and others, Andre Linde and others in the 80s.

02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:16.040
And this idea of inflation is basically that

02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:21.040
when a singularity begins this process of growth,

02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:27.560
there can be a temporary stage

02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:30.880
where it just accelerates incredibly rapidly.

02:22:30.880 --> 02:22:33.760
And based on quantum field theory,

02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:35.720
this tells us that this should produce matter

02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:37.840
in precisely the proportions that we find

02:22:37.840 --> 02:22:41.280
of hydrogen and helium in the big bang, lithium too,

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:44.800
lithium also, and other things too.

02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:46.520
So the predictions that come out

02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:48.480
of big bang inflationary cosmology

02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:52.520
have stood up extremely well to empirical verification,

02:22:52.520 --> 02:22:55.720
the cosmic microwave background, things like this.

02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:59.520
So most scientists working in the field

02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:03.720
think that the origin of our universe is the big bang.

02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:08.040
And I base all my thinking on that as well.

02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:11.440
I'm just laying this out there so that people understand

02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:14.160
that where I'm coming from is an extension,

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:19.080
not a replacement of existing well-founded ideas.

02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:21.920
In a paper, I believe it was 1986,

02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:26.560
with Alan Guth and another author Farhi,

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:30.240
they wrote that a big bang,

02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:31.480
I don't remember the exact quote,

02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:35.240
a big bang is inextricably linked with a black hole.

02:23:35.240 --> 02:23:39.200
The singularity that we call our origin

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:42.280
is mathematically indistinguishable from a black hole.

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:44.320
They're the same thing.

02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:48.880
And Lee Smolin based his thinking on that idea,

02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:50.680
I believe, I don't mean to speak for him,

02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:52.040
but this is my reading of it.

02:23:52.040 --> 02:23:54.960
So what Lee Smolin will say is that

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.560
a black hole in one universe is a big bang

02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:00.680
in another universe.

02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:04.640
And this allows us to have progeny, offspring.

02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:08.360
So a universe can be said to have come

02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:10.480
before another universe.

02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:14.160
And very crucially, Smolin argues,

02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:16.880
I think this is potentially one of the great ideas

02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:18.600
of all time, that's my opinion,

02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:22.360
that when a black hole forms, it's not a classical entity,

02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:24.480
it's a quantum gravitational entity.

02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:27.200
So it is subject to the fluctuations

02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:29.760
that are inherent in quantum mechanics.

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:35.360
The properties, what we're calling the parameters

02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:38.520
that describe the physics of that system

02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:40.560
are subject to slight mutations.

02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:43.360
So that the offspring universe does not have

02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:46.160
the exact same parameters defining its physics

02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:48.320
as its parent universe.

02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:50.360
They're close, but they're a little bit different.

02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:55.080
And so now you have a mechanism for evolution,

02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:57.200
for natural selection.

02:24:57.200 --> 02:24:59.600
So there's mutation, so there's,

02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:03.280
and then if you think about the DNA of the universe

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:05.880
are the basic parameters that govern its laws.

02:25:05.880 --> 02:25:10.120
Exactly, so what Smolin said is,

02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:13.600
our universe results from an evolutionary process

02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:14.720
that can be traced back some,

02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:17.640
he estimated 200 million generations.

02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:20.640
Initially there was something like a vacuum fluctuation

02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:24.200
that produced, through random chance,

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:27.360
a universe that was able to reproduce just once.

02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:28.680
So now it had one offspring.

02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:31.040
And then over time it was able to make more and more

02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:35.360
until it evolved into a highly structured universe

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:40.240
with a very long lifetime, with a great deal of complexity.

02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:44.160
And importantly, especially importantly for Lee Smolin,

02:25:44.160 --> 02:25:47.240
stars, stars make black holes.

02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:50.960
Therefore we should expect our universe to be optimized,

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:53.240
have its physical parameters optimized

02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:55.680
to make very large numbers of stars

02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:57.880
because that's how you make black holes.

02:25:57.960 --> 02:25:59.480
And black holes make offspring.

02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:03.760
So we expect the physics of our universe to have evolved

02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:06.760
to maximize fecundity, the number of offspring.

02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:10.200
And the way Lee Smolin argues you do that is through stars

02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:13.480
that the biggest ones die in these core collapse supernova

02:26:13.480 --> 02:26:15.720
that make a black hole and a child.

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:19.840
Okay, first of all, I agree with you that

02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:24.720
this is back to our fractal view of everything

02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:27.200
from intelligence to our universe.

02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:31.080
That is very compelling and a very powerful idea

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:36.080
that unites the origin of life

02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:39.720
and perhaps the origin of ideas and intelligence.

02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:42.160
So from a Dawkins perspective here on earth,

02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:45.320
the evolution of those and then the evolution

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:49.640
of the laws of physics that led to us.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:52.280
I mean, it's beautiful.

02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:54.840
And then you stacking on top of that,

02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:57.480
that maybe we are one of the offspring.

02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:01.040
Right, okay, so before getting into

02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:03.040
where I'd like to take that idea,

02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:05.160
let me just a little bit more groundwork.

02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:07.080
There is this concept of the multiverse

02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:08.600
and it can be confusing.

02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:11.720
Different people use the word multiverse in different ways.

02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:16.720
In the multiverse that I think is relevant to picture

02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:20.840
when trying to grasp Lee Smolin's idea,

02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.280
essentially every vacuum fluctuation

02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:25.960
can be referred to as a universe.

02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:28.880
It occurs, it borrows energy from the vacuum

02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:30.240
for some finite amount of time

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:34.000
and it evanesces back into the quantum vacuum.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000
And ideas of Guth before that and Andre Linde

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:42.840
with eternal inflation aren't that different

02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:44.840
that you would expect nature

02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:47.280
due to the quantum properties of the vacuum,

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:49.840
which we know exists, they're measurable

02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:52.560
through things like the Casimir effect and others.

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:54.520
You know that there are these fluctuations

02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:55.400
that are occurring.

02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:57.840
What Smolin is arguing is that

02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:00.760
there is this extensive multiverse that we,

02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:04.880
this universe, what we can measure and interact with

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:07.360
is not unique in nature.

02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:10.760
It's just our residence, it's where we reside.

02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:13.600
And there are countless, potentially infinity,

02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:17.240
other universes, other entire evolutionary trajectories

02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:19.120
that have evolved into things

02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:20.960
like what you were mentioning a second ago

02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:24.040
with different parameters and different ways

02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:27.000
of achieving complexity and reproduction and all that stuff.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.480
So it's not that the evolutionary process

02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:34.200
is a funnel towards this end point, not at all.

02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:36.960
Just like the biological evolutionary process

02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:39.320
that has occurred within our universe

02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:42.800
is not a unique route toward achieving

02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:45.000
one specific chosen kind of species.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.160
No, we have extraordinary diversity around us.

02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:50.520
That's what evolution does.

02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:52.240
And for any one species like us,

02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:54.880
it might feel like we're at the center of this process.

02:28:54.880 --> 02:28:57.200
We're the destination of this process,

02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:59.520
but we're just one of the many

02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:02.280
nearly infinite branches of this process.

02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:04.280
And I suspect it is exactly infinite.

02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:09.080
I mean, I just can't understand how with this idea,

02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:11.080
you can ever draw a boundary around it and say,

02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:14.120
no, the universe, I mean, the multiverse has

02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:18.880
10 to the one quadrillion components, but not infinity.

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:20.200
I don't know, that's-

02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:24.080
Well, yeah, I have cognitively incapable,

02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:25.680
as I think all of us are,

02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:29.120
and truly understanding the concept of infinity.

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:31.040
And the concept of nothing as well.

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:31.920
And nothing.

02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:35.440
But also the concept of a lot is pretty difficult.

02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:40.000
I could just, I run out of fingers at a certain point,

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:40.840
and then you're screwed.

02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:41.840
And when you're wearing shoes

02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:44.480
and you can't even get down to your toes, it's like-

02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:47.120
It's like, all right, 1,000, fine, a million.

02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:48.080
Is that what?

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.080
And then it gets crazier and crazier.

02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:50.920
Right, right.

02:29:51.760 --> 02:29:54.840
So this particular, so when we say technology, by the way,

02:29:55.720 --> 02:30:00.680
I mean, there's some, not to over romanticize the thing,

02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:04.200
but there is some aspect about this branch of ours

02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:08.040
that allows us to, for the universe to know itself.

02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:09.000
Yes, yes.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:14.000
So to have like little conscious cognitive fingers

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.200
that are able to feel like to scratch the head.

02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:19.520
Right, right, right.

02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:21.920
To be able to construct E equals MC squared

02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:25.520
and to introspect, to start to gain some understanding

02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:27.320
of the laws that govern it.

02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:31.920
Isn't that kind of amazing?

02:30:31.920 --> 02:30:35.480
Okay, I'm just human, but it feels like that,

02:30:35.480 --> 02:30:39.120
if I were to build a system that does this kind of thing,

02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:41.960
that evolves laws of physics, that evolves life,

02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:45.480
that evolves intelligence, that my goal would be

02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:47.040
to come up with things that are able

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:49.320
to think about itself, right?

02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:53.400
Aren't we kind of close to the design specs,

02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:54.720
the destination?

02:30:54.720 --> 02:30:56.040
We're pretty close, I don't know.

02:30:56.040 --> 02:30:58.360
I mean, I'm spending my career designing things

02:30:58.360 --> 02:30:59.840
that I hope will think about themselves.

02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:00.680
Exactly.

02:31:00.680 --> 02:31:02.680
So you and I aren't too far apart on that one.

02:31:02.680 --> 02:31:05.520
But then maybe that problem is a lot harder

02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:06.360
than we imagine.

02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:07.840
Maybe we need to.

02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:10.840
Let's not get too far, because I wanna emphasize

02:31:10.840 --> 02:31:13.600
something that what you're saying is,

02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:16.920
isn't it fascinating that the universe evolved something

02:31:16.920 --> 02:31:19.920
that can be conscious, reflect on itself?

02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:23.800
But Lee Smolin's idea didn't take us there, remember?

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:25.800
It took us to stars.

02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:30.400
Lee Smolin has argued, I think, right on almost

02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:35.400
every single way that cosmological natural selection

02:31:35.800 --> 02:31:38.800
could lead to a universe with rich structure.

02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:41.200
And he argued that the structure,

02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:43.240
the physics of our universe is designed

02:31:43.240 --> 02:31:46.200
to make a lot of stars so that they can make black holes.

02:31:46.200 --> 02:31:48.480
But that doesn't explain what we're doing here.

02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:51.440
In order for that to be an explanation of us,

02:31:51.440 --> 02:31:55.440
what you have to assume is that once you made that universe

02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:59.280
that was capable of producing stars, life, planets,

02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:01.360
all these other things, we're along for the ride.

02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:02.240
They got lucky.

02:32:02.240 --> 02:32:05.680
We're kind of arising, growing up in the cracks,

02:32:05.680 --> 02:32:07.280
but the universe isn't here for us.

02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:09.320
We're still kind of a fluke in that picture.

02:32:09.320 --> 02:32:12.640
And I can't, I don't necessarily have

02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:14.920
a philosophical opposition to that stance.

02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:19.920
It's just not, okay, so I don't think it's complete.

02:32:20.280 --> 02:32:23.040
So it seems like whatever we got going on here to you,

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:25.720
it seems like whatever we have here on Earth

02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:28.520
seems like a thing you might want to select for

02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:29.840
in this whole big process.

02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:32.440
Exactly, so if what you are truly,

02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:34.960
if your entire evolutionary process

02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:36.880
only cares about fecundity,

02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:39.880
it only cares about making offspring universes

02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:41.880
because then there's gonna be the most of them

02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:45.280
in that local region of hyperspace,

02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:49.480
which is the set of all possible universes, let's say.

02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:52.960
You don't care how those universes are made.

02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:55.000
You know they have to be made by black holes.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:58.080
This is what inflationary theory tells us.

02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:02.200
The Big Bang tells us that black holes make universes.

02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:04.360
But what if there was a technological means

02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:06.080
to make universes?

02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:09.440
Stars require a ton of matter

02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:11.760
because they're not thinking very carefully

02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:12.920
about how you make a black hole.

02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:15.120
They're just using gravity, you know?

02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:19.320
But if we devise technologies

02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:23.440
that can efficiently compress matter into a singularity,

02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:26.360
it turns out that if you can compress about 10 kilograms

02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:28.720
into a very small volume,

02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:30.640
that will make a black hole that is likely,

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:34.880
highly probable to inflate into its own offspring universe.

02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:37.200
This is according to calculations done by other people

02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:38.840
who are professional quantum theorists,

02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:40.280
quantum field theorists,

02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:44.600
and I hope I am grasping what they're telling me correctly.

02:33:44.600 --> 02:33:47.640
I'm somewhat of a translator here.

02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:50.480
But so that's the position

02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:52.720
that is particularly intriguing to me,

02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:56.320
which is that what might have happened is that,

02:33:56.320 --> 02:34:01.200
okay, this particular branch on the vast tree of evolution,

02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:03.280
cosmological evolution that we're talking about,

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:05.760
not biological evolution within our universe,

02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:07.840
but cosmological evolution,

02:34:07.840 --> 02:34:09.640
went through exactly the process

02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:10.960
that Lee Smolin described.

02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:13.840
Got to the stage where stars

02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.880
were making lots of black holes,

02:34:15.880 --> 02:34:17.480
but then continued to evolve

02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.280
and somehow bridged that gap and made intelligence

02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:24.160
and intelligence capable of devising technologies

02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:27.920
because technologies in intelligent species

02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:29.720
working in conjunction with technologies

02:34:29.720 --> 02:34:32.160
could then produce even more.

02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:36.920
More efficiently, more faster and better and more different,

02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:38.840
then you start to have different kind of mechanisms

02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:40.880
and mutation perhaps, all that kind of stuff.

02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:43.160
And so if you do a simple calculation that says,

02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:45.320
all right, if I want to,

02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:50.320
we know roughly how many core collapse supernovae

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.520
have resulted in black holes in our galaxy

02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:56.040
since the beginning of the universe,

02:34:56.040 --> 02:34:57.800
and it's something like a billion.

02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:00.680
So then you would have to estimate

02:35:00.680 --> 02:35:04.280
that it would be possible for a technological civilization

02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:07.440
to produce more than a billion black holes

02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:10.000
with the energy and matter at their disposal.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.720
And so one of the calculations in that paper,

02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:14.080
back of the envelope,

02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:16.400
but I think revealing nonetheless is that

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:20.800
if you take a relatively common asteroid,

02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:23.720
something that's about a kilometer in diameter,

02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:26.760
what I'm thinking of is just scrap material

02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:29.040
laying around in our solar system

02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:31.480
and break it up into 10 kilogram chunks

02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:33.400
and turn each of those into a universe,

02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:38.160
then you would have made at least a trillion black holes

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:41.560
outpacing the star production rate

02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:43.400
by some three orders of magnitude.

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:44.840
That's one asteroid.

02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:46.920
So now if you envision an intelligent species

02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:51.000
that would potentially have been devised initially

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.200
by humans, but then based on superconducting

02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.240
optoelectronic networks, no doubt,

02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:57.160
and they go out and populate,

02:35:57.160 --> 02:35:59.000
they don't have to fill the galaxy.

02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:01.720
They just have to get out to the asteroid belt.

02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:05.320
They could potentially dramatically outpace

02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:07.920
the rate at which stars are producing offspring universes.

02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:09.360
And then wouldn't you expect

02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:13.160
that that's where we came from instead of a star?

02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:16.600
Yeah, so you have to somehow become masters of gravity,

02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:17.920
so like, or generate-

02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:18.760
Not necessarily gravity.

02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:20.680
So stars make black holes with gravity,

02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:25.680
but any force that can make the energy density

02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:29.320
can compactify matter to produce a great enough

02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.840
energy density can form a singularity.

02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:33.520
It would not likely be gravity.

02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:34.520
It's the weakest force.

02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:38.480
You're more likely to use something like the technologies

02:36:38.480 --> 02:36:40.480
that we're developing for fusion, for example.

02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:44.240
So I don't know, the large ignition facility

02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:49.240
recently blasted a pellet with 100 really bright lasers

02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:53.360
and caused that to get dense enough

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:55.280
to engage in nuclear fusion.

02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:56.760
So something more like that,

02:36:56.760 --> 02:36:58.720
or a tokamak with a really hot plasma.

02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:00.320
I'm not sure, something.

02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:02.160
I don't know exactly how it would be done.

02:37:02.160 --> 02:37:04.560
I do like the idea that,

02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:07.120
especially just been reading a lot about gravitational waves

02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:09.600
and the fact that us humans

02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:11.720
with our technological capabilities,

02:37:11.720 --> 02:37:15.840
one of the most impressive technological accomplishments

02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:17.360
of human history is LIGO,

02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:20.720
being able to precisely detect gravitational waves.

02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:25.000
I particularly find appealing the idea

02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.520
that other alien civilizations from very far distances

02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:34.320
communicate with gravity, with gravitational waves,

02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:37.760
because as you become greater and greater master of gravity,

02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:40.560
which seems way out of reach for us right now,

02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:44.040
maybe that seems like an effective way of sending signals,

02:37:44.040 --> 02:37:48.400
especially if your job is to manufacture black holes.

02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:49.240
Right.

02:37:49.240 --> 02:37:51.800
So let me ask there,

02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:56.400
whatever, I mean, broadly thinking,

02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:58.880
because we tend to think other alien civilizations

02:37:58.880 --> 02:37:59.960
would be very human-like,

02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:04.040
but if we think of alien civilizations out there

02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:06.600
as basically generators of black holes,

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:10.000
however they do it, because they go stars,

02:38:10.920 --> 02:38:12.760
do you think there's a lot of them

02:38:12.760 --> 02:38:15.720
in our particular universe out there?

02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.160
In our universe?

02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:23.040
Well, okay, let me ask, okay, this is great.

02:38:23.040 --> 02:38:26.320
Let me ask a very generic question,

02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:28.840
and then let's see how you answer it,

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:33.840
which is how many alien civilizations are out there?

02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:38.040
If the hypothesis that I just described

02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:40.480
is on the right track,

02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:43.560
it would mean that the parameters of our universe

02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:48.120
have been selected so that intelligent civilizations

02:38:48.480 --> 02:38:51.120
will occur in sufficient numbers

02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:54.720
so that if they reach something

02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:56.480
like supreme technological maturity,

02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:00.080
let's define that as the ability to produce black holes,

02:39:00.080 --> 02:39:02.640
then that's not a highly improbable event.

02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:05.440
It doesn't need to happen often,

02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:06.680
because as I just described,

02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:09.200
if you get one of them in a galaxy,

02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:10.520
you're gonna make more black holes

02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:12.720
than the stars in that galaxy.

02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:16.560
But there's also not a super strong motivation,

02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:21.560
well, it's not obvious that you need them

02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:24.440
to be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy.

02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:26.840
So one of the things that I try to emphasize

02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:30.680
in that paper is that given this idea

02:39:30.680 --> 02:39:35.160
of how our parameters might have been selected,

02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:39.320
it's clear that it's a series of trade-offs, right?

02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:42.080
If you make, I mean, in order for intelligent life

02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:45.760
of our variety or anything resembling us to occur,

02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:47.600
you need a bunch of stuff, you need stars.

02:39:47.600 --> 02:39:51.040
So that's right back to Smolin's roots of this idea,

02:39:51.040 --> 02:39:54.440
but you also need water to have certain properties.

02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:58.760
You need things like the rocky planets,

02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:00.600
like the earth to be within the habitable zone,

02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:02.680
all these things that you start talking about

02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:06.760
in the field of astrobiology,

02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:08.840
trying to understand life in the universe,

02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:10.520
but you can't over-emphasize,

02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:13.600
you can't tune the parameters so precisely

02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:15.160
to maximize the number of stars

02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:18.960
or to give water exactly the properties

02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:22.280
or to make rocky planets like earth the most numerous,

02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:24.480
you have to compromise on all these things.

02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:27.360
And so I think the way to test this idea

02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:30.600
is to look at what parameters are necessary

02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:32.760
for each of these different subsystems,

02:40:32.760 --> 02:40:35.080
and I've laid out a few that I think are promising,

02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:36.680
there could be countless others,

02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:40.840
and see how changing the parameters

02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:43.600
makes it more or less likely that stars would form

02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:44.680
and have long lifetimes,

02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:47.320
or that rocky planets in the habitable zone

02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:49.440
are likely to form, all these different things.

02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:52.200
So we can test how much these things

02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:54.600
are in a tug of war with each other,

02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:56.320
and the prediction would be

02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:58.200
that we kind of sit at this central point

02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:02.040
where if you move the parameters too much,

02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:05.720
stars aren't stable, or life doesn't form,

02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:07.800
or technology's infeasible,

02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:10.800
because life alone, at least the kind of life

02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:14.160
that we know of, cannot make black holes.

02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:17.000
We don't have this, well, I'm speaking for myself,

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:18.560
you're a very fit and strong person,

02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:20.600
but it might be possible for you,

02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:22.360
but not for me to compress matter.

02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:23.840
So we need these technologies,

02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:28.840
but we don't know, we have not been able to quantify yet

02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:33.840
how finely adjusted the parameters would need to be

02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:35.600
in order for silicon to have the properties it does.

02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:37.840
Okay, this is not directly speaking to what you're saying,

02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:39.520
you're getting to the Fermi paradox,

02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:42.840
which is where are they, where are the life forms out there,

02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:44.560
how numerous are they, that sort of thing.

02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:46.200
What I'm trying to argue is that

02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:50.800
if this framework is on the right track,

02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:53.520
a potentially correct explanation for our existence,

02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:56.320
it doesn't necessarily predict

02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:59.280
that intelligent civilizations are just everywhere,

02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:02.520
because even if you just get one of them in a galaxy,

02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:05.760
which is quite rare, it could be enough

02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:08.920
to dramatically increase the fecundity

02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:10.160
of the universe as a whole.

02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:12.440
Yeah, and I wonder, once you start generating

02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:15.400
the offspring for universes, black holes,

02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:18.400
how that has effect on the,

02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:20.920
what kind of effect does it have on the other

02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:26.160
candidates, civilizations within that universe?

02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:28.440
Maybe as a destructive aspect,

02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:30.160
or there could be some arguments about

02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:32.080
once you have a lot of offspring,

02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:34.040
that that just quickly accelerates

02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:35.840
to where the other ones can't even catch up.

02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:39.240
It could, but I guess if you want me

02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:42.560
to put my chips on the table or whatever,

02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:45.360
I think I come down more on the side

02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:51.320
that intelligent life civilizations are rare.

02:42:52.440 --> 02:42:57.200
And I guess I follow Max Tegmark here.

02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:01.040
And also, there's a lot of papers coming out recently

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:04.400
in the field of astrobiology that are seeming to say,

02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:06.040
all right, you just work through the numbers

02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:09.720
on some modified Drake equation or something like that.

02:43:09.720 --> 02:43:13.000
And it looks like it's not improbable.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:16.240
You shouldn't be surprised that an intelligent species

02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:18.000
has arisen in our galaxy,

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.320
but if you think there's one the next solar system over,

02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:21.560
it's highly improbable.

02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:23.920
So I can see that the number,

02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:28.240
the probability of finding a civilization in a galaxy,

02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.000
maybe it's most likely that you're gonna find

02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:32.800
one to a hundred or something.

02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:34.880
But okay, now it's really important

02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:36.600
to put a time window on that, I think,

02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:40.040
because does that mean in the entire lifetime

02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:42.040
of the galaxy before it,

02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:47.000
so for in our case, before we run into Andromeda,

02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:51.880
I think it's highly probable,

02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:53.000
I shouldn't say I think,

02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:56.720
it's tempting to believe that it's highly probable

02:43:56.720 --> 02:43:59.960
that in that entire lifetime of your galaxy,

02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:02.600
you're gonna get at least one intelligent species,

02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:05.160
maybe thousands or something like that.

02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:07.320
But it's also, I think,

02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:10.440
a little bit naive to think

02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:13.240
that they're going to coincide in time

02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:15.000
and we'll be able to observe them.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.000
And also, if you look at the span of life on Earth,

02:44:20.120 --> 02:44:22.320
the Earth history,

02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:26.480
it was surprising to me to kind of look at

02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:28.560
the amount of time, first of all,

02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:31.560
the short amount of time there's no life is surprising.

02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:33.480
Life sprang up pretty quickly.

02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:35.280
It's cellular, single cell.

02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:37.000
But that's the point I'm trying to make,

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:42.000
is like so much of life on Earth

02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:44.240
was just like single cell organisms,

02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:45.880
like most of it.

02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:48.680
Most of it was like boring bacteria type of stuff.

02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:50.680
Well, bacteria are fascinating, but I take your point.

02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:51.520
No, I get it.

02:44:51.520 --> 02:44:52.920
I mean, no offense to them.

02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:57.680
This kind of speaking from the perspective of your paper

02:44:57.680 --> 02:44:59.960
of something that's able to generate technology

02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:01.480
as we kind of understand it,

02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:03.440
that's a very short moment in time

02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:08.440
relative to that full history of life on Earth.

02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:12.240
And maybe our universe is just saturated

02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:15.960
with bacteria like humans,

02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:22.520
but not the special extra AGI super humans.

02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:25.560
That those are very rare.

02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:28.440
And once those spring up,

02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:30.400
everything just goes to like,

02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:33.400
it accelerates very quickly.

02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:36.560
Yeah, we just don't have enough data to really say,

02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:40.040
but I find this whole subject extremely engaging.

02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:41.720
I mean, there's this concept,

02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:43.920
I think it's called the rare earth hypothesis,

02:45:43.920 --> 02:45:46.960
which is that basically stating that,

02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:49.080
okay, microbes were here right away

02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:52.160
after the Hadean era where we were being bombarded.

02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:54.960
Well, after, yeah, bombarded by comets, asteroids,

02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:57.120
things like that, and also after the moon formed.

02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:59.600
So once things settled down a little bit,

02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:02.280
in a few hundred million years,

02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:03.680
you have microbes everywhere.

02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:05.360
And it could have been, we don't know exactly when,

02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:08.080
it could have been remarkably brief that that took.

02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:10.200
So it does indicate that, okay,

02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:12.160
life forms relatively easily.

02:46:12.160 --> 02:46:15.920
I think that alone is sort of a checker on the scale

02:46:15.920 --> 02:46:20.920
for the argument that the parameters that allow

02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:24.360
even microbial life to form are not just a fluke,

02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:27.560
but anyway, that aside, yes,

02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:29.920
then there was this long dormant period,

02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:31.640
not dormant, things were happening,

02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:34.160
but important things were happening

02:46:34.160 --> 02:46:37.360
for some two and a half billion years or something

02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:41.720
after the metabolic process that releases oxygen

02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:45.000
was developed, then basically the planet's

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.600
just sitting there getting more and more oxygenated,

02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:50.240
more and more oxygenated until it's enough

02:46:50.240 --> 02:46:54.200
that you can build these large complex organisms.

02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:57.000
And so the rare earth hypothesis would argue that

02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:01.040
the microbes are common and everywhere

02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:04.200
in any planet that's roughly in the habitable zone

02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:06.720
and has some water on it is probably gonna have those.

02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:09.360
But then getting to this Cambrian explosion

02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:13.800
that happened some between five and 600 million years ago,

02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:17.880
that's rare, and I buy that.

02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:19.120
I think that is rare.

02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:21.920
So if you say how much life is in our galaxy,

02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:24.120
I think that's probably the right answer

02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:26.440
is that microbes are everywhere.

02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:29.360
Cambrian explosion is extremely rare.

02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:32.760
And then, but the Cambrian explosion kind of went like that

02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:37.760
where within a couple tens or a hundred million years,

02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:40.960
all of these body plans came into existence.

02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:43.080
And basically all of the body plans

02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:46.080
that are now in existence on the planet

02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:48.720
were formed in that brief window

02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:51.640
and we've just been shuffling around since then.

02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:54.800
So then what caused humans to pop out of that?

02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:59.800
I mean, that could be another extremely rare threshold

02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:06.160
that a planet roughly in the habitable zone with water

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:08.360
is not guaranteed to cross.

02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:10.400
To me, it's fascinating for being humble.

02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:13.040
The humans cannot possibly be the most amazing thing

02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:15.840
that such, if you look at the entirety of the system

02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:17.760
that Lee Smolin and you paint,

02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:20.040
that cannot possibly be the most amazing thing

02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:21.440
that process generates.

02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:23.680
So if you look at the evolution,

02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:27.000
what's the equivalent in the cosmological evolution

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:28.960
and its selection for technology,

02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:32.440
the equivalent of the human eye or the human brain?

02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:34.720
Universes that are able to do some,

02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:37.760
they don't need the damn stars.

02:48:37.760 --> 02:48:42.080
They dare able to just do some incredible generation

02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:46.640
of complexity fast, like much more than,

02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:47.480
if you think about it,

02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:50.880
it's like most of our universe is pretty freaking boring.

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:51.960
There's not much going on.

02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:53.400
There's a few rocks flying around

02:48:53.400 --> 02:48:55.600
and there's some like apes that are just like

02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:00.520
doing podcasts on some weird planet.

02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:02.880
It just seems very inefficient.

02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:05.360
If you think about like the amazing thing,

02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:08.800
the human eye, the visual cortex can do the brain,

02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:12.880
the nervous, everything that makes us more powerful

02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:15.520
than single cell organisms,

02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:19.000
like if there's an equivalent of that for universes,

02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:24.640
the richness of physics that could be expressed

02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:26.640
through a particular set of parameters.

02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:33.800
For me, I'm sort of from a computer science perspective,

02:49:33.800 --> 02:49:35.640
huge fan of cellular automata,

02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:40.440
which is a nice sort of pretty visual way to illustrate

02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:44.520
how different laws can result in drastically

02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:46.440
different levels of complexity.

02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:50.320
It's like, yeah, okay, so we're all celebrating,

02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:52.120
look, our little cellular automata

02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:54.560
is able to generate pretty triangles and squares

02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:57.560
and therefore we achieve general intelligence.

02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:01.800
And then there'll be like some badass Chuck Norris type,

02:50:01.800 --> 02:50:06.520
like universal Turing machine type of cellular automata.

02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:09.480
They're able to generate other cellular automata

02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:13.080
that does any arbitrary level of computation off the bat.

02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:16.400
Like those have to then exist.

02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:20.800
And then we're just like, we'll be forgotten is the story.

02:50:20.800 --> 02:50:24.840
This podcast just entertains a few other apes

02:50:24.840 --> 02:50:26.840
for a few months.

02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:30.400
Well, I'm kind of surprised to hear your cynicism.

02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.040
No, I'm very...

02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:36.080
I usually think of you as like one who celebrates humanity

02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:37.560
and all its forms and things like that.

02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:39.200
And I guess I just, I don't,

02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:40.960
I see it the way you just described.

02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:44.560
I mean, okay, we've been here for 13.7 billion years

02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:47.280
and you're saying, gosh, that's a long time.

02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:48.520
Let's get on with the show already.

02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:51.520
Some other universe could have kicked our butt by now,

02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:55.320
but that's putting a characteristic time.

02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:58.400
I mean, why is 13.7 billion a long time?

02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:00.440
I mean, compared to what?

02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:02.320
I guess, so when I look at our universe,

02:51:02.320 --> 02:51:05.400
I see this extraordinary hierarchy

02:51:05.400 --> 02:51:08.080
that has developed over that time.

02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:10.520
So at the beginning, it was a chaotic mess

02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:16.080
of some plasma and nothing interesting going on there.

02:51:16.080 --> 02:51:18.880
And even for the first stars to form,

02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:23.880
that a lot of really interesting evolutionary processes

02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:26.240
had to occur by evolutionary in that sense,

02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:30.520
I just mean taking place over extended periods of time

02:51:30.520 --> 02:51:32.000
and structures are forming then.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.640
And then it took that first generation of stars

02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:37.440
in order to produce the metals

02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:41.320
that then can more efficiently produce

02:51:41.320 --> 02:51:42.480
another generation of stars.

02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:44.760
We're only the third generation of stars,

02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:47.960
so we might still be pretty quick to the game here.

02:51:47.960 --> 02:51:50.760
So, but I don't think, I don't,

02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:52.440
okay, so then you have these stars

02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:53.560
and then you have solar systems.

02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:57.800
On those solar systems, you have rocky worlds,

02:51:57.800 --> 02:51:59.800
you have gas giants, like all this complexity.

02:51:59.800 --> 02:52:01.120
And then you start getting life

02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:03.800
and the complexity that's evolved

02:52:03.800 --> 02:52:06.440
through the evolutionary process in life forms

02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:09.880
is just, it's not a letdown to me.

02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:14.600
Just some of it is like some of the planets is like icy.

02:52:14.600 --> 02:52:16.120
It's like different flavors of ice cream.

02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:18.600
They're icy, but there might be water underneath

02:52:18.600 --> 02:52:21.160
all kinds of life forms and some volcanoes,

02:52:21.160 --> 02:52:22.360
all kinds of weird stuff.

02:52:22.360 --> 02:52:24.640
No, no, I don't, I think it's beautiful.

02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:25.960
I think our life is beautiful.

02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:29.600
And I think it was designed that by design,

02:52:29.600 --> 02:52:31.240
the scarcity of the whole thing.

02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:33.880
I think mortality, as terrifying as it is,

02:52:33.880 --> 02:52:37.320
is fundamental to the whole reason we enjoy everything.

02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:38.240
No, I think it's beautiful.

02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:42.440
I just think that all of us conscious beings

02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:44.560
in the grand scheme of basically

02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:47.000
at every scale will be completely forgotten.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:47.840
Well, that's true.

02:52:47.840 --> 02:52:49.360
I think everything is transient

02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:52.560
and that would go back to maybe something more like Lao Tzu,

02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:55.480
the Tao Te Ching or something where it's like,

02:52:55.480 --> 02:52:57.760
yes, there is nothing but change.

02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:00.760
There is nothing but emergence and dissolve and that's it.

02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:03.800
But I just, in this picture of this hierarchy

02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:06.560
that's developed, I don't mean to say

02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:08.480
that now it gets to us and that's the pinnacle.

02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:11.520
In fact, I think at a high level,

02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:15.280
the story I'm trying to tease out in my research is about,

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:18.160
okay, well, so then what's the next level of hierarchy?

02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:22.720
And if it's, okay, we're kind of pretty smart.

02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:24.880
I mean, talking about people like Lee Small

02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:27.440
and Alan Gooth, Max Tegmark, okay, we're really smart.

02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:29.280
Talking about me, okay, we're kind of,

02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:31.960
we can find our way to the grocery store or whatever.

02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:32.960
What's next?

02:53:32.960 --> 02:53:36.120
I mean, what if there's another level of hierarchy

02:53:36.120 --> 02:53:40.280
that grows on top of us that is even more profoundly capable?

02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:42.320
And I mean, we've talked a lot about

02:53:42.320 --> 02:53:43.560
superconducting sensors.

02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:48.560
Imagine these cognitive systems far more capable than us

02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:52.320
residing somewhere else in the solar system

02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:53.640
off of the surface of the earth

02:53:53.640 --> 02:53:55.400
where it's much darker, much colder,

02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:57.080
much more naturally suited to them.

02:53:57.080 --> 02:53:59.360
And they have these sensors that can detect

02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:02.680
single photons of light from radio waves

02:54:02.680 --> 02:54:05.240
out to all across the spectrum to gamma rays

02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:07.440
and just see the whole universe.

02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:08.960
And they just live in space

02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:12.960
with these massive collection optics so that they,

02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:13.800
what do they do?

02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:16.120
They just look out and experience

02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:21.120
that vast array of what's being developed.

02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:24.280
And if you're such a system,

02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:28.960
presumably you would do some things for fun

02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:31.720
and the kind of fun thing I would do

02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:33.840
as somebody who likes video games

02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:37.040
is I would create and maintain

02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:39.320
and observe something like earth.

02:54:41.320 --> 02:54:46.320
And so in some sense, we're like all players on a stage

02:54:47.320 --> 02:54:52.320
for this superconducting cold computing system out there.

02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:56.680
I mean, all of this is fascinating to think.

02:54:56.720 --> 02:54:59.360
The fact that you're actually designing systems

02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:01.640
here on earth that are trying to push this technological

02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:03.360
at the very cutting edge

02:55:03.360 --> 02:55:07.520
and also thinking about how does the evolution

02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:12.520
of physical laws lead us to the way we are is fascinating.

02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:15.920
That coupling is fascinating.

02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:20.800
It's like the ultimate rigorous application of philosophy

02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:23.680
to the rigorous application of engineering.

02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:26.400
So Jeff, you're one of the most fascinating,

02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:30.440
I did not know much about you except through your work.

02:55:30.440 --> 02:55:34.960
And I'm so glad we got this chance to talk here.

02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:37.760
You're one of the best explainers

02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:39.800
of exceptionally difficult concepts.

02:55:40.920 --> 02:55:44.560
And you're also, speaking of like fractal,

02:55:44.560 --> 02:55:46.680
you're able to function intellectually

02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:50.200
at all levels of the stack, which I deeply appreciate.

02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:51.600
This was really fun.

02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:53.560
You're a great educator, a great scientist.

02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:56.040
It's an honor that you would spend

02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:57.240
your valuable time with me.

02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:00.080
It's an honor that you would spend your time with me as well.

02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:00.920
Thanks, Jeff.

02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:03.560
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:05.240
with Jeff Shaneline.

02:56:05.240 --> 02:56:06.680
To support this podcast,

please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:12.040
And now let me leave you with some words

02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:14.400
from the great John Carmack,

02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:17.280
who surely will be a guest on this podcast soon.

02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:20.080
Because of the nature of Moore's Law,

02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:22.800
anything that an extremely clever graphics programmer

02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:26.040
can do at one point can be replicated

02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:29.360
by a merely competent programmer some number of years later.

02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:33.400
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
