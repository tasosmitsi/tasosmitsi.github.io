00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
The following is a conversation with Stephen Wolfram, his third time on the podcast.

00:04.800 --> 00:10.240
He's a computer scientist, mathematician, theoretical physicist, and the founder of

00:10.240 --> 00:15.920
Wolfram Research, a company behind Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram Language,

00:15.920 --> 00:22.160
and the new Wolfram Physics Project. This conversation is a wild technical rollercoaster

00:22.160 --> 00:28.080
ride through topics of complexity, mathematics, physics, computing, and consciousness.

00:28.080 --> 00:34.400
I think this is what this podcast is becoming, a wild ride. Some episodes are about physics,

00:34.400 --> 00:40.400
some about robots, some are about war and power, some are about the human condition

00:40.400 --> 00:46.400
and our search for meaning, and some are just what the comedian Tim Dillon calls fun.

00:47.680 --> 00:52.800
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out the sponsors in the description.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.400
And now, here's my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.

00:57.360 --> 01:04.320
Almost 20 years ago, you published a new kind of science where you presented a study of complexity

01:04.320 --> 01:11.120
and an approach for modeling of complex systems. So, let us return again to the core idea of

01:11.120 --> 01:18.240
complexity. What is complexity? I don't know, I think that's not the most interesting question.

01:18.240 --> 01:23.840
It's like, you know, if you ask a biologist what is life, that's not the question they care the

01:23.920 --> 01:31.280
most about. What I was interested in is, how does something that we would usually identify

01:31.280 --> 01:35.600
as complexity arise in nature? And I got interested in that question like 50 years ago,

01:35.600 --> 01:41.760
which is really embarrassingly long time ago. And, you know, I was, you know, how does snowflakes

01:41.760 --> 01:46.160
get to have complicated forms? How do galaxies get to have complicated shapes? How does, you know,

01:46.160 --> 01:51.360
how do living systems get produced? Things like that. And the question is, what's the sort of

01:51.360 --> 01:57.200
underlying scientific basis for those kinds of things? And the thing that I was at first very

01:57.200 --> 02:01.120
surprised by because I've been doing physics, some particle physics, some fancy mathematical

02:01.120 --> 02:05.600
physics and so on. And it's like, I know all this fancy stuff. I should be able to solve this sort

02:05.600 --> 02:13.680
of basic science question. And I couldn't. This was like early, maybe 1980-ish timeframe. And it's

02:13.680 --> 02:19.440
like, okay, what can one do to understand the sort of basic secret that nature seems to have? Because

02:19.440 --> 02:22.960
it seems like nature, you know, you look around in the natural world, it's full of incredibly

02:22.960 --> 02:28.640
complicated forms. You look at sort of most engineered kinds of things. For instance,

02:28.640 --> 02:34.160
they tend to be, you know, we've got sort of circles and lines and things like this.

02:34.160 --> 02:38.720
The question is, what secret does nature have that lets it make all this complexity

02:38.720 --> 02:43.920
that we in doing engineering, for example, don't naturally seem to have? And so that was the kind

02:43.920 --> 02:48.640
of the thing that I got interested in. And then the question was, you know, could I understand

02:48.640 --> 02:52.800
that with things like mathematical physics? Well, it didn't work very well. So then I got

02:52.800 --> 02:57.600
to thinking about, okay, is there some other way to try to understand this? And then the question

02:57.600 --> 03:01.920
was, if you're going to look at some system in nature, how do you make a model for that system,

03:01.920 --> 03:06.640
for what that system does? So, you know, a model is some abstract representation of the system,

03:06.640 --> 03:11.920
some formal representation of the system. What is the raw material that you can make that model out

03:11.920 --> 03:18.880
of? And so what I realized was, well, actually, programs are really good source of raw material

03:18.880 --> 03:24.880
for making models of things. And, you know, in terms of my personal history, to me, that seemed

03:24.880 --> 03:29.120
really obvious. And the reason it seemed really obvious is because I just spent several years

03:29.120 --> 03:33.200
building this big piece of software that was sort of a predecessor to Mathematica and Morphin

03:33.200 --> 03:39.840
Language, a thing called SMP, Symbolic Manipulation Program, which was something that had this idea of

03:39.840 --> 03:44.800
starting from just these computational primitives and building up everything one had to build up.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.880
And so kind of the notion of, well, let's just try and make models by starting from

03:48.880 --> 03:52.960
computational primitives and seeing what we can build up. That seemed like a totally obvious

03:52.960 --> 03:58.400
thing to do. In retrospect, it might not have been externally quite so obvious, but it was

03:58.400 --> 04:02.880
obvious to me at the time, given the path that I happened to have been on. So, you know, so that

04:02.880 --> 04:09.120
got me into this question of let's use programs to model what happens in nature. And the question

04:09.120 --> 04:13.920
then is, well, what kind of programs? And, you know, we're used to programs that you write for

04:13.920 --> 04:18.000
some particular purpose, and it's a big long piece of code, and it does some specific thing.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.960
But what I got interested in was, okay, if you just go out into the sort of computational

04:22.960 --> 04:27.920
universe of possible programs, you say, take the simplest program you can imagine, what does it do?

04:28.560 --> 04:33.360
And so I started studying these things called cellular automata. Actually, I didn't know at

04:33.360 --> 04:38.080
first they were called cellular automata, but I found that out subsequently. But it's just a line

04:38.080 --> 04:42.560
of cells. You know, each one is black or white, and it's just some rule that says the color of

04:42.560 --> 04:46.720
the cell is determined by the color that it had on the previous step, and it's two neighbors on

04:46.720 --> 04:53.920
the previous step. And I had initially thought that sufficiently simple setup is not going to

04:53.920 --> 04:59.440
do anything interesting. It's always going to be simple, no complexity, simple rule, simple behavior.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.160
Okay, but then I actually ran the computer experiment, which is pretty easy to do. I mean,

05:04.160 --> 05:11.520
it probably took a few hours originally. And the results were not what I'd expected at all.

05:11.520 --> 05:16.000
Now, needless to say, in the way that science actually works, the results that I got had a

05:16.000 --> 05:20.080
lot of unexpected things, which I thought were really interesting. But the really strongest

05:20.080 --> 05:24.240
results, which was already right there in the printouts I made, I didn't really understand for

05:24.240 --> 05:30.320
a couple more years. So it was not, you know, the compressed version of the story is you run

05:30.320 --> 05:34.960
the experiment and you immediately see what's going on, but I wasn't smart enough to do that,

05:34.960 --> 05:41.920
so to speak. But the big thing is even with very simple rules of that type, sort of the minimal

05:42.480 --> 05:48.720
tiniest program, sort of the one line program or something, it's possible to get very complicated

05:48.720 --> 05:53.360
behavior. My favorite example is this thing called rule 30, which is a particular cellular

05:53.360 --> 05:57.840
automaton rule. You just start it off in one black cell, and it makes this really complicated

05:57.840 --> 06:05.600
pattern. And so that, for me, was sort of a critical discovery that then kind of said,

06:06.240 --> 06:11.520
playing back onto, you know, how does nature make complexity, I sort of realized that might

06:11.520 --> 06:15.840
be how it does it. That might be kind of the secret that it's using is that in this kind of

06:15.840 --> 06:20.640
computational universe of possible programs, it's actually pretty easy to get programs where,

06:20.640 --> 06:24.720
even though the program is simple, the behavior when you run the program is not simple at all.

06:25.360 --> 06:33.040
And so for me, that was the kind of the story of kind of how that was sort of the indication

06:33.040 --> 06:37.920
that one had got an idea of what the sort of secret that nature uses to make complexity

06:37.920 --> 06:43.520
and how complexity can be made in other places. Now, if you say, what is complexity?

06:46.160 --> 06:52.640
Complexity is it's not easy to tell what's going on. That's the informal version of what is

06:52.640 --> 06:58.240
complexity. But there is something going on, but it's not easy to know what. Well, no, the rules

06:58.240 --> 07:04.960
can generate just randomness, right? Well, that's not obvious. In other words,

07:04.960 --> 07:09.520
it's not obvious at all. And it wasn't what I expected. It's not what people's intuition

07:09.520 --> 07:16.160
had been and has been for a long time. That is, one might think you have a rule. You can tell

07:16.880 --> 07:19.760
there's a rule behind it. I mean, it's just like the early

07:20.240 --> 07:26.400
you know, robots in science fiction movies, right? You can tell it's a robot because it does simple

07:26.400 --> 07:31.680
things, right? Turns out that isn't actually the right story. But it's not obvious that isn't the

07:31.680 --> 07:37.200
right story because people assume simple rules, simple behavior. And that the sort of the key

07:37.200 --> 07:42.880
discovery about the computational universe is that isn't true. And that discovery goes very deep

07:42.880 --> 07:48.480
and relates to all kinds of things that I've spent years and years studying. But, you know,

07:48.880 --> 07:54.240
in the end, the sort of the what is complexity is, well, you can't easily tell what it's going

07:54.240 --> 08:00.080
to do. You could just run the rule and see what happens. But you can't just say, oh, you know,

08:00.080 --> 08:05.040
show me the rule. Great. And now I know what's going to happen. And, you know, the key phenomenon

08:05.040 --> 08:11.200
around that is this thing I call computational irreducibility. This fact that in something like

08:11.200 --> 08:16.400
rule 30, you might say, well, what's it going to do after a million steps? Well, you can run it for

08:16.400 --> 08:22.000
a million steps and just do what it does to find out. But you can't compress that you can't reduce

08:22.000 --> 08:25.920
that and say, I'm going to be able to jump ahead and say, this is what it's going to do after a

08:25.920 --> 08:29.360
million steps, but I don't have to go through anything like that computational effort.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.440
By the way, has anybody succeeded at that? Do you had a challenge, a competition?

08:33.440 --> 08:34.080
Right.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.560
For predicting the middle column of rule 30.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.200
Indeed.

08:37.200 --> 08:37.680
Anybody?

08:38.240 --> 08:42.720
A number of people have sent things in and sort of people are picking away at it, but it's hard.

08:42.800 --> 08:50.880
I mean, I've been actually even proving that the center column of rule 30 doesn't repeat.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.480
That's something I think might be doable. Okay.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.760
Mathematically proving.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.960
Yes. And so that's analogous to a similar kind of things like the digits of pi,

09:00.960 --> 09:05.280
which are also generated in this very deterministic way. And so a question is,

09:05.280 --> 09:10.720
how random are the digits of pi? For example, first of all, do the digits of pi ever repeat?

09:10.720 --> 09:15.600
We know they don't because it was proved in the 1800s that pi is not a rational number.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.280
So that means only rational numbers have digit sequences that repeat.

09:19.280 --> 09:24.240
So we know the digits of pi don't repeat. So now the question is, does zero, one, two, three,

09:24.240 --> 09:28.240
or whatever, do all the digits base 10 or base two, or however you work it out,

09:28.240 --> 09:34.320
do they all occur with equal frequency? Nobody knows. That's far away from what can be understood

09:34.320 --> 09:42.240
mathematically at this point. And that's kind of, but I'm even looking for step one, which is

09:42.240 --> 09:47.040
prove that the center column doesn't repeat, and then prove other things about it like

09:47.040 --> 09:52.640
equidistribution of equal numbers of zeros and ones. And those are things which I kind of set

09:52.640 --> 09:59.360
up this little prize thing because I thought those were not too out of range. Those are things which

09:59.440 --> 10:06.560
are within a modest amount of time, it's conceivable that those could be done. They're not

10:06.560 --> 10:11.440
far away from what current mathematics might allow. They'll require a bunch of cleverness

10:11.440 --> 10:15.680
and hopefully some interesting new ideas that will be useful other places.

10:15.680 --> 10:23.360
CB But you started in 1980 with this idea before I think you realized this idea of programs.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.640
You thought that there might be some kind of thermodynamic like randomness,

10:28.640 --> 10:35.280
and then complexity comes from a clever filter that you kind of, like, I don't know,

10:35.280 --> 10:40.000
spaghetti or something. You filter the randomness and outcomes complexity,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.400
which is an interesting intuition. How do we know that's not actually what's happening?

10:45.280 --> 10:52.640
Just because you were then able to develop, look, you don't need this incredible randomness,

10:52.640 --> 10:58.240
you can just have very simple, predictable initial conditions and predictable rules.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.960
And then from that emerged complexity. Still, there might be some systems where

11:03.840 --> 11:10.640
it's filtering randomness in the inputs. AC Well, the point is, when you have quotes

11:10.640 --> 11:15.120
randomness in the input, that means there's all kinds of information in the input. And in a sense,

11:15.120 --> 11:21.280
what you get out will be maybe just something close to what you put in. People are very

11:21.280 --> 11:25.120
in dynamical systems theory, sort of big area of mathematics that developed

11:25.840 --> 11:31.760
from the early 1900s and really got big in the 1980s. An example of what people study there a

11:31.760 --> 11:38.640
lot, and its popular version is chaos theory. An example of what people study a lot is the shift

11:38.640 --> 11:45.040
map, which is basically taking 2x mod 1 to the fractional part of 2x, which is basically just

11:45.040 --> 11:50.640
taking digits in binary and shifting them to the left. So at every step, you get to see,

11:50.640 --> 11:55.360
if you say, how big is this number that I got out? Well, the most important digit in that number

11:55.360 --> 12:00.960
is whatever ended up at the left-hand end. But now, if you start off from an arbitrary random

12:00.960 --> 12:06.800
number, which is quotes randomly chosen, so all its digits are random, then when you run that

12:06.800 --> 12:12.560
sort of chaos theory shift map, all that you get out is just whatever you put in. You just get to

12:12.560 --> 12:18.080
see what... It's not obvious that you would excavate all of those digits. And if you're,

12:18.080 --> 12:22.960
for example, making a theory of fluid mechanics, for example, if there was that phenomenon in

12:22.960 --> 12:27.760
fluid mechanics, then the equations of fluid mechanics can't be right. Because what that

12:27.760 --> 12:33.760
would be saying is the equations that it matters to the fluid, what happens in the fluid at the

12:33.760 --> 12:39.760
level of the millionth digit of the initial conditions, which is far below the point at

12:39.760 --> 12:44.560
which you're hitting sizes of molecules and things like that. So it's almost explaining

12:45.200 --> 12:50.640
if that phenomenon is an important thing. It's telling you that fluid dynamics, which describes

12:50.640 --> 12:59.200
fluids as continuous media and so on, isn't really right. So this idea that... It's a tricky thing

12:59.200 --> 13:04.880
because as soon as you put randomness in, you have to know how much of what's coming out is

13:04.880 --> 13:08.960
what you put in versus how much is actually something that's being generated. And what's

13:08.960 --> 13:13.840
really nice about these systems where you just have very simple initial conditions and where

13:13.840 --> 13:18.720
you get random stuff out or seemingly random stuff out is you don't have that issue. You

13:18.720 --> 13:23.520
don't have to argue about, was there something complicated put in? Because it's plainly obvious

13:23.520 --> 13:29.280
there wasn't. Now, as a practical matter in doing experiments, the big thing is, if the thing you

13:29.280 --> 13:36.240
see is complex and reproducible, then it didn't come from just filtering some, quotes, randomness

13:36.240 --> 13:41.680
from the outside world. It has to be something that is intrinsically made because it wouldn't

13:41.680 --> 13:47.840
otherwise be... It could be the case that you set things up and it's always the same each time and

13:47.840 --> 13:52.560
you say, well, it's kind of the same, but it's not random each time because it's kind of the

13:52.560 --> 13:58.400
definition of it being random is it was kind of picked at random each time, so to speak.

13:58.400 --> 14:04.640
So is it possible to for sure know that our universe does not, at the fundamental level,

14:04.640 --> 14:10.800
have randomness? Is it possible to conclusively say there's no randomness at the bottom?

14:11.680 --> 14:18.560
It's an interesting question. Natural science is an inductive business. You observe a bunch of

14:18.560 --> 14:23.920
things and you say, can we fit these together? What is our hypothesis for what's going on?

14:23.920 --> 14:29.440
The thing that I think I can say fairly definitively is at this point, we understand

14:29.440 --> 14:36.400
enough about fundamental physics that if there was sort of an extra dice being thrown,

14:37.120 --> 14:44.160
it's something that doesn't need to be there. We can get what we see without that. Now, could you

14:44.160 --> 14:52.480
add that in as an extra little featureoid without breaking the universe? Probably. But in fact,

14:52.480 --> 14:57.200
almost certainly yes. But is it necessary for understanding the universe? No. And I think

14:57.200 --> 15:04.880
actually from a more fundamental point of view, I think I might be able to argue... So one of the

15:04.880 --> 15:09.040
things that I've been interested in and been pretty surprised that I've had anything sentient

15:09.040 --> 15:14.240
to say about is the question of why does the universe exist? I didn't think that was a question

15:14.240 --> 15:21.360
that I would... I thought that was a far out there metaphysical kind of thing. Even the philosophers

15:21.360 --> 15:27.440
have stayed away from that question for the most part. It's such a kind of difficult to address

15:27.440 --> 15:33.040
question. But I actually think to my great surprise that from our physics project and so on, that it

15:33.040 --> 15:38.560
is possible to actually address that question and explain why the universe exists. And I kind of

15:38.560 --> 15:43.680
have a suspicion. I've not thought it through. I kind of have a suspicion that that explanation

15:43.680 --> 15:49.200
will eventually show you that in no meaningful sense, can there be randomness underneath the

15:49.200 --> 15:56.640
universe? That is that if there is, it's something that is necessarily irrelevant to our perception

15:56.640 --> 16:02.400
of the universe. That is that it could be there, but it doesn't matter. Because in a sense, we've

16:03.360 --> 16:08.240
whatever it would do, whatever extra thing it would add, is not relevant to our perception

16:08.240 --> 16:15.520
of what's going on. So why does the universe exist? How does the irrelevance of randomness

16:15.520 --> 16:22.000
connect to the big why question of the universe? Okay. So I mean, why does the universe exist?

16:22.000 --> 16:28.240
Well, let's see. And is this the only universe we got? It's the only one. About that, I'm pretty

16:28.240 --> 16:34.720
sure. So now maybe which one, which of these topics is better to enter first? Why does the

16:34.720 --> 16:40.640
universe exist? And why you think it's the only one that exists? Well, I think they're very closely

16:40.640 --> 16:46.240
related. Okay. Okay. So I mean, the first thing, let's see, I mean, this why does the universe

16:46.240 --> 16:52.080
exist question is built on top of all these things that we've been figuring out about fundamental

16:52.080 --> 16:55.920
physics. Because if you want to know why the universe exists, you kind of have to know what

16:55.920 --> 17:03.920
the universe is made of. And I think the, well, let me describe a little bit about the why does

17:03.920 --> 17:08.240
the universe exist question. So the main issue is, let's say you have a model for the universe,

17:08.880 --> 17:13.200
and you say, I've got this program or something, and you run it and you make the universe.

17:13.760 --> 17:19.360
Now you say, well, why is that program actually running? And people say, you've got this program

17:19.360 --> 17:24.160
that makes the universe, what computer is it running on? Right? What does it mean? What

17:24.160 --> 17:28.480
actualizes something, you know, two plus two equals four, but that's different from saying

17:28.480 --> 17:32.960
there's two, a pile of two rocks, another pile of two rocks, and somebody moves them together and

17:32.960 --> 17:39.280
makes four, so to speak. And so what is it that kind of turns it from being just this formal thing

17:39.280 --> 17:45.440
to being something that is actualized? Okay. So there we have to start thinking about, well,

17:45.440 --> 17:50.320
well, what do we actually know about what's going on in the universe? Well, we are observers of this

17:50.320 --> 17:57.680
universe, but confusingly enough, we're part of this universe. So in a sense, if we say,

17:57.680 --> 18:02.560
what do we know about what's going on in the universe? Well, what we know is what sort of our

18:02.560 --> 18:08.000
consciousness records about what's going on in the universe. And consciousness is part of the

18:08.000 --> 18:13.760
fabric of the universe, so we're in it. Yes, we're in it. And maybe I should start off by

18:13.840 --> 18:18.080
saying something about the consciousness story, because that's some-

18:18.080 --> 18:25.920
Yes. Maybe we should begin even before that, at the very base layer of the Wolfram Physics Project.

18:26.720 --> 18:32.800
Maybe you can give a broad overview, once again, really quick about this hypergraph model.

18:33.520 --> 18:39.200
And also, what is it, a year and a half ago, since you've brought this project to the world,

18:39.200 --> 18:44.720
what is the status update? What are all the beautiful ideas you have come across?

18:45.760 --> 18:51.040
What are the interesting things you can mention? I mean, it's a frigging Cambrian explosion.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.880
It's crazy. I mean, there are all these things which I've kind of wondered about for years,

18:56.880 --> 19:03.120
and suddenly, there's actually a way to think about them. And I really did not see, I mean,

19:03.120 --> 19:07.600
the real strength of what's happened, I absolutely did not see coming. And the real strength of it

19:07.600 --> 19:12.240
is we've got this model for physics, but it turns out it's a foundational kind of model

19:12.240 --> 19:16.560
that's a different kind of computation-like model that I'm kind of calling the sort of

19:16.560 --> 19:23.600
multi-computational model. And that kind of model is applicable not only to physics,

19:23.600 --> 19:28.960
but also to lots of other kinds of things. And one reason that's extremely powerful is because

19:28.960 --> 19:33.680
physics has been very successful. So we know a lot based on what we figured out in physics.

19:33.680 --> 19:38.480
And if we know that the same model governs physics and governs, I don't know, economics,

19:38.480 --> 19:43.920
linguistics, immunology, whatever, we know that the same kind of model governs those things.

19:43.920 --> 19:48.720
We can start using things that we've successfully discovered in physics and applying those

19:48.720 --> 19:54.000
intuitions in all these other areas. And that's pretty exciting and very surprising to me.

19:54.720 --> 20:00.480
And in fact, it's kind of like in the original story of you go and you explain why is there

20:00.480 --> 20:04.640
complexity in the natural world, then you realize, well, there's all this complexity,

20:04.640 --> 20:09.120
there's all this computational irreducibility. There's a lot we can't know about what's going

20:09.120 --> 20:14.320
to happen. It's kind of a very confusing thing for people who say science has nailed everything

20:14.320 --> 20:18.720
down. Based on science, we can know everything. Well, actually, there's this computational

20:18.720 --> 20:24.000
irreducibility thing right in the middle of that, thrown up by science, so to speak.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.400
And then the question is, well, given computational irreducibility, how can we actually figure out

20:28.400 --> 20:33.120
anything about what happens in the world? Why are we able to predict anything? Why are we able

20:33.120 --> 20:37.840
to operate in the world? And the answer is that we sort of live in these slices of computational

20:37.840 --> 20:43.920
reusability that exist in this kind of ocean of computational irreducibility. And it turns out

20:43.920 --> 20:49.680
that seems that it's a very fundamental feature of the kind of model that seems to operate in

20:49.680 --> 20:55.680
physics and perhaps in a lot of these other areas, that there are these particular slices

20:55.680 --> 21:01.920
of computational reusability that are relevant to us. And those are the things that both allow

21:01.920 --> 21:06.400
us to operate in the world and not just have everything be completely unpredictable, but

21:06.400 --> 21:11.040
there are also things that potentially give us what amount to sort of physics-like laws

21:11.600 --> 21:17.040
in all these other areas. So that's been sort of an exciting thing. But I would say that in general

21:17.040 --> 21:24.640
for our project, it's been going spectacularly well. Honestly, it wasn't something I expected

21:24.640 --> 21:32.080
to happen in my lifetime. I mean, it's something where, and in fact, one of the things about it,

21:32.080 --> 21:36.880
some of the things that we've discovered are things where I was pretty sure that wasn't how

21:36.880 --> 21:43.600
things worked. And turns out I'm wrong. And in a major area in meta-mathematics, I've been

21:43.600 --> 21:50.080
realizing that something I've long believed, we can talk about it later, that just really isn't

21:50.080 --> 21:57.440
right. But I think that the thing that... So what's happened with the physics project? I mean,

21:57.440 --> 22:02.720
you know, it can explain a little bit about how the model works, but basically...

22:02.720 --> 22:08.880
We can maybe ask you the following question. So it's easy through words to describe how cellular

22:08.880 --> 22:16.800
automata works. You've explained this. And it's the fundamental mechanism by which you, in your

22:16.800 --> 22:22.480
book, in your kind of science, explored the idea of complexity and how to do science in this world

22:22.480 --> 22:31.280
of reducible islands and general irreducibility. Okay. So how does the model of

22:31.280 --> 22:35.840
hypergraphs differ from cellular automata? And how does the idea of multi-computation

22:36.480 --> 22:43.200
differ? Maybe that's a way to describe it. Right. Yeah, right. This is a... My life is,

22:43.200 --> 22:46.640
like all of our lives, something of a story of computational irreducibility.

22:46.640 --> 22:52.560
Yes. And it's been going for a few years now. So it's always a challenge to kind of find these

22:52.560 --> 22:58.400
appropriate pockets of reducibility. But let me see what I can do. So I mean, first of all, let's

22:58.400 --> 23:06.320
talk about physics, first of all. And a key observation, the starting point of our physics

23:06.320 --> 23:13.920
project is things about what is space? What is the universe made of? And ever since Euclid,

23:13.920 --> 23:18.640
people just sort of say space is just this thing where you can put things at any position you want.

23:18.640 --> 23:22.880
And they're just points and they're just geometrical things that you can just arbitrarily

23:22.880 --> 23:28.560
put at different coordinate positions. So the first thing in our physics project is the idea

23:28.560 --> 23:33.520
that space is made of something. Just like water is made of molecules, space is made of kind of

23:33.520 --> 23:38.400
atoms of space. And the only thing we can say about these atoms of space is they have some

23:38.400 --> 23:44.720
identity. It's this atom as opposed to this atom. And you could give them, if you're a computer

23:44.720 --> 23:51.760
person, you give them UUIDs or something. Yes. But that's all there is to say about them,

23:51.760 --> 23:59.840
so to speak. And then all we know about these atoms of space is how they relate to each other.

23:59.840 --> 24:06.080
So we say these three atoms of space are associated with each other in some relation. So

24:06.080 --> 24:12.240
you can think about that as what atom of space is friends with what other atom of space? You can

24:12.240 --> 24:17.440
build this essentially friend network of the atoms of space. And the sort of starting point

24:17.440 --> 24:22.320
of our physics project is that's what our universe is. It's a giant friend network of the atoms of

24:22.320 --> 24:29.920
space. And so how can that possibly represent our universe? Well, it's like in something like

24:29.920 --> 24:36.320
water, there are molecules bouncing around, but on a large scale, that produces fluid flow,

24:36.320 --> 24:40.800
and we have fluid vortices, and we have all of these phenomena that are sort of the emergent

24:40.800 --> 24:46.480
phenomena from that underlying kind of collection of molecules bouncing around. And by the way,

24:46.480 --> 24:50.400
it's important that that collection of molecules bouncing around have this phenomenon of

24:50.400 --> 24:54.240
computational irreducibility. That's actually what leads to the second law of thermodynamics,

24:54.240 --> 24:59.760
among other things. And that leads to the sort of randomness of the underlying behavior,

24:59.760 --> 25:05.120
which is what gives you something which on a large scale seems like it's a smooth continuous

25:05.840 --> 25:12.400
type of thing. And so, okay, so first thing is space is made of something. It's made of all these

25:12.400 --> 25:19.440
atoms of space connected together in this network. And then everything that we experience is sort of

25:19.440 --> 25:24.400
features of that structure of space. So when we have an electron or something or a photon,

25:24.400 --> 25:29.440
it's some kind of tangle in the structure of space, much like kind of a vortex and a fluid

25:29.440 --> 25:35.040
would be just this thing that is, it can actually, the vortex can move around, it can involve

25:35.040 --> 25:39.920
different molecules in the fluid, but the vortex still stays there. And if you zoom out enough,

25:39.920 --> 25:45.280
the vortex looks like an atom itself, like a basic atom. So there's the levels of abstraction.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.320
If you squint and kind of blur things out, it looks like at every level of abstraction,

25:52.320 --> 25:59.680
you can define what is a basic individual entity. Yes. But in this model, there's a bottom level.

26:00.240 --> 26:05.600
There's an elementary length, maybe 10 to the minus 100 meters, let's say, which is really small.

26:05.600 --> 26:11.600
Proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters. The smallest we've ever been able to sort of see with a

26:11.680 --> 26:17.760
particle accelerator is around 10 to the minus 21 meters. So if we don't know precisely what

26:17.760 --> 26:21.520
the correct scale is, but it's perhaps over the order of 10 to the minus 100 meters. So it's

26:21.520 --> 26:26.880
pretty small. But that's the end. That's what things are made of.

26:26.880 --> 26:32.400
What's your intuition where the 10 to the minus 100 comes from? What's your intuition about this

26:32.400 --> 26:37.200
scale? Well, okay. So there's a calculation which I consider to be somewhat rickety,

26:37.840 --> 26:43.280
which has to do with comparing. So there are various fundamental constants. There's the speed

26:43.280 --> 26:49.040
of light. The speed of light, once you know the elementary time, the speed of light tells you the

26:49.040 --> 26:53.120
conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length. Then there's the question of

26:53.120 --> 26:58.560
how do you convert to the elementary energy and how do you convert between other things?

26:58.560 --> 27:01.920
And there are various constants we know. We know the speed of light. We know the gravitational

27:01.920 --> 27:07.520
constant. We know Planck's constant and quantum mechanics. Those are the three important ones.

27:07.520 --> 27:11.600
And we actually know some other things. We know things like the size of the universe,

27:11.600 --> 27:16.960
the Hubble constant, things like that. And essentially this calculation of the elementary

27:16.960 --> 27:22.720
length comes from looking at these sort of combination of those. Okay. So the most obvious

27:22.720 --> 27:27.040
thing, people have sort of assumed that quantum gravity happens at this thing, the Planck scale,

27:27.040 --> 27:32.560
10 to the minus 34 meters, which is sort of the combination of Planck's constant and the

27:32.560 --> 27:38.400
gravitational constant, the speed of light that gives you that kind of length. Turns out in our

27:38.400 --> 27:44.080
model, there is an additional parameter, which is essentially the number of simultaneous threads

27:44.080 --> 27:48.560
of execution of the universe, which is essentially the number of sort of independent quantum

27:49.360 --> 27:54.000
processes that are going on. And that number, let's see if I remember that number, that number is

27:54.000 --> 28:03.200
10 to the 170, I think. And so it's a big number. But that number then connects, sort of modifies

28:03.200 --> 28:08.400
what you might think from all these Planck units to give you the things we're giving.

28:08.400 --> 28:13.280
And there's been sort of a mystery actually in the more technical physics thing, that the Planck

28:13.840 --> 28:20.400
mass, the Planck energy, Planck energy is actually surprisingly big. The Planck length is tiny, 10

28:20.400 --> 28:25.360
to the minus 34 meters, Planck time 10 to the minus 43 meters, I think, seconds, I think.

28:26.240 --> 28:33.760
But the Planck energy is like the energy of a lightning strike, which is pretty weird.

28:33.760 --> 28:39.440
In our models, the actual elementary energy is that divided by the number of sort of simultaneous

28:39.440 --> 28:44.800
quantum threads, and it ends up being really small too. And that sort of explains that mystery that's

28:44.800 --> 28:52.400
been around for a while about how Planck units work. But whether that precise estimate is right,

28:52.400 --> 28:56.480
we don't know yet. That's one of the things that's sort of been a thing we've been pretty

28:56.480 --> 29:02.400
interested in, is how do you see through, how do you make a gravitational microscope

29:02.400 --> 29:08.480
that can kind of see through to the atoms of space? How do you get in fluid flow, for example,

29:08.480 --> 29:13.840
if you go to hypersonic flow or something, you've got a Mach 20 space plane or something,

29:13.840 --> 29:19.040
it really matters that there are individual molecules hitting the space plane, not a continuous

29:19.040 --> 29:27.680
fluid. The question is, what is the analog of hypersonic flow for things about the structure

29:27.680 --> 29:34.560
of space time? And it looks like a rapidly rotating black hole at the sort of critical

29:34.560 --> 29:43.040
rotation rate. It looks as if that's a case where essentially the structure of space time is just

29:43.040 --> 29:51.360
about to fall apart. And you may be able to kind of see the evidence of sort of discrete elements.

29:51.920 --> 29:56.560
You may be able to kind of see the sort of gravitational microscope of actually seeing

29:56.560 --> 30:01.840
these discrete elements of space. And there may be some effect in, for example, gravitational

30:01.840 --> 30:08.080
waves produced by rapidly rotating black hole, in which one could actually see some phenomenon

30:08.160 --> 30:14.240
where one can say, yes, these don't come out the way one would expect based on having a continuous

30:14.240 --> 30:19.120
structure of space time. Is it something where you can kind of see through to the discrete structure?

30:19.840 --> 30:20.800
We don't know that yet.

30:20.800 --> 30:26.640
CB So can you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper how a microscope they can see to 10 to the minus

30:27.440 --> 30:37.680
100, how rotating black holes and presumably the detailed accurate detection of gravitational

30:37.680 --> 30:41.920
waves from such black holes can reveal the discreteness of space?

30:41.920 --> 30:47.360
AL Okay. First thing is what is a black hole? Actually, we need to go a little bit further in

30:47.360 --> 30:50.560
the story of what space time is, because I explained a little bit about what space is,

30:50.560 --> 30:55.600
but I didn't talk about what time is. And that's sort of important in understanding space time,

30:55.600 --> 30:56.080
so to speak.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.840
CB And your sense is both space and time in this story are discrete.

30:59.840 --> 31:03.120
AL Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's a complicated story.

31:03.120 --> 31:03.600
CB Yes.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.200
AL And needless to say.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.640
CB Well, it's simple at the bottom.

31:07.120 --> 31:15.280
AL It's very simple at the bottom. In the end, it's simple, but deeply abstract. And something

31:15.280 --> 31:22.000
that is simple in conception, but kind of wrapping one's head around what's going on is pretty hard.

31:23.760 --> 31:29.040
So first of all, we have described these kind of atoms of space and their connections.

31:29.040 --> 31:33.920
You can think about these things as a hypergraph. A graph is just you connect nodes to nodes,

31:33.920 --> 31:40.800
but a hypergraph, you can have individual friends to friends, but you can have these

31:40.800 --> 31:47.200
triplets of friends or whatever else. And so we're just saying, and that's just the relations

31:47.200 --> 31:52.960
between atoms of space are the hyper edges of the hypergraph. And so we got some big collection of

31:52.960 --> 31:58.960
these atoms of space, maybe 10 to the 400 or something in our universe. And that's the

31:58.960 --> 32:05.680
structure of space. That's an every feature of what we experience in the world is a feature of

32:05.680 --> 32:11.520
that hypergraph, that spatial hypergraph. So then the question is, well, what does that spatial

32:11.520 --> 32:18.400
hypergraph do? Well, the idea is that there are rules that update that spatial hypergraph.

32:18.400 --> 32:23.520
And in a cellular automaton, you've just got this line of cells and you just say at every step,

32:23.520 --> 32:27.840
at every time step, you've got fixed time steps, fixed array of cells. At every step,

32:28.480 --> 32:34.640
every cell gets updated according to a certain rule. And that's the way it works. Now in this

32:34.640 --> 32:40.400
hypergraph, it's sort of vaguely the same kind of thing. We say every time you see a little piece

32:40.400 --> 32:46.400
of hypergraph that looks like this, update it to one that looks like this. So just keep rewriting

32:46.400 --> 32:50.640
this hypergraph. Every time you see something that looks like that anywhere in the universe,

32:50.640 --> 32:54.880
it gets rewritten. Now, one thing that's tricky about that, which we'll come to is this

32:54.880 --> 33:01.120
multi-computational idea, which has to do with, you're not saying in some kind of lockstep way,

33:01.120 --> 33:05.600
do this one, then this one, then this one. It's just whenever you see one you can do,

33:05.600 --> 33:10.560
you can go ahead and do it. And that leads one not to have a single thread of time in the universe.

33:11.120 --> 33:15.520
Because if you knew which one to do, you would just say, okay, we do this one, then we do this

33:15.520 --> 33:19.680
one, then we do this one. But if you say, just do whichever one you feel like, you end up with

33:19.680 --> 33:23.440
these multiple threads of time, these kind of multiple histories of the universe, depending

33:23.440 --> 33:28.800
on which order you happen to do the things you could do in. So it's fundamentally asynchronous

33:28.800 --> 33:35.200
and parallel. Yes. Which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seeks for things to be

33:35.200 --> 33:42.480
sequential and synchronous. Right. Well, I think that this is part of the story of consciousness,

33:42.480 --> 33:48.480
is I think the key aspect of consciousness that is important for sort of parsing the universe

33:48.480 --> 33:53.680
is this point that we have a single thread of experience. We have a memory of what happened

33:53.680 --> 33:57.680
in the past, we can say something and predict something about the future, but there's a single

33:57.680 --> 34:00.960
thread of experience. And it's not obvious it should work that way. I mean, we've got 100

34:00.960 --> 34:05.520
billion neurons in our brains and they're all firing in all kinds of different ways. But yet,

34:05.520 --> 34:14.160
our experience is that there is the single thread of time that goes along. And I think that one of

34:14.160 --> 34:18.560
the things I've kind of realized with a lot more clarity in the last year is the fact that

34:20.240 --> 34:25.520
we conclude that the universe has the laws it has is a consequence of the fact that we have

34:25.520 --> 34:32.560
consciousness the way we have consciousness. And so just to go on with kind of the basic setup,

34:33.600 --> 34:38.800
so we've got this spatial hypergraph, it's got all these atoms of space, they're getting these

34:38.800 --> 34:41.760
little clumps of atoms of space are getting turned into other clumps of atoms of space,

34:41.760 --> 34:45.360
and that's happening everywhere in the universe all the time. And so one thing that's a little

34:45.360 --> 34:49.840
bit weird is there's nothing permanent in the universe. The universe is getting rewritten

34:49.840 --> 34:54.640
everywhere all the time. And if it wasn't getting rewritten, space wouldn't be knitted together.

34:54.640 --> 34:58.800
That is, space would just fall apart. There wouldn't be any way in which we could say this

34:58.800 --> 35:04.880
part of space is next to this part of space. One of the things that people were confused about

35:04.880 --> 35:11.440
back in antiquity, the ancient Greek philosophers and so on is how does motion work? How can it be

35:11.440 --> 35:17.120
the case that you can take a thing that we can walk around and it's still us when we walked a foot

35:17.120 --> 35:23.200
forward, so to speak. And in a sense with our models, that's again a question because it's a

35:23.200 --> 35:29.200
different set of atoms of space. When I move my hand, it's moving into a different set of atoms

35:29.200 --> 35:35.360
of space. It's having to be recreated. The thing itself is not there. It's being continuously

35:35.360 --> 35:40.560
recreated all the time. Now it's a little bit like waves in an ocean, vortices in a fluid,

35:40.560 --> 35:46.080
which again, the actual molecules that exist in those are not what define the identity of the

35:46.080 --> 35:54.320
thing. But it's a little bit this idea that there can be pure motion, that it is even possible

35:54.320 --> 36:00.240
for an object to just move around in the universe and not change. It's not self-evident that such

36:00.240 --> 36:05.200
a thing should be possible. And that is part of our perception of the universe is that we

36:06.160 --> 36:10.080
parse those aspects of the universe where things like pure motion are possible.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.600
Now, pure motion, even in general relativity, the theory of gravity,

36:14.480 --> 36:20.080
pure motion is a little bit of a complicated thing. If you imagine your average teacup or

36:20.080 --> 36:25.120
something approaching a black hole, it is deformed and distorted by the structure of spacetime.

36:25.120 --> 36:29.920
And to say, is it really pure motion? Is it that same teacup that's the same shape? Well,

36:29.920 --> 36:34.720
it's a bit of a complicated story. And this is a more extreme version of that.

36:34.720 --> 36:41.760
So anyway, the thing that's happening is we've got space, we've got this notion of time. So time

36:41.760 --> 36:46.720
is this kind of this rewriting of the hypergraph. And one of the things that's important about that

36:46.720 --> 36:52.480
time is this sort of computationally irreducible process. There's something, time is not something

36:52.480 --> 36:58.240
where in kind of the mathematical view of time tends to be time is just a coordinate. We can

36:59.200 --> 37:04.720
slide a slider, turn a knob, and we'll change the time that we've got in this equation.

37:04.720 --> 37:10.240
But in this picture of time, that's not how it works at all. Time is this inexorable,

37:10.240 --> 37:16.240
irreducible kind of set of computations that go on, that go from where we are now to the future.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.320
And one of the things that is, again, something one sort of has to break out of

37:22.320 --> 37:27.440
is your average trained physicist like me says space and time are the same kind of thing. They're

37:27.440 --> 37:33.040
related by the Poincare group and Lorentz transformations and relativity and all these

37:33.040 --> 37:39.040
kinds of things. And space and time, there are all these kind of sort of folk stories you can

37:39.040 --> 37:43.440
tell about why space and time are the same kind of thing. In this model, they're fundamentally

37:43.440 --> 37:49.360
not the same kind of thing. Space is this kind of sort of connections between these atoms of space,

37:49.360 --> 37:54.720
time is this computational process. So the thing that the first sort of surprising thing

37:54.720 --> 37:58.800
is, well, it turns out you get relativity anyway. And the reason that happens,

37:58.800 --> 38:04.560
the few bits and pieces here, which one has to understand, but the fundamental point is,

38:04.560 --> 38:11.280
if you are an observer embedded in the system that are part of this whole story of things

38:11.280 --> 38:16.320
getting updated in this way and that, there's sort of a limit to what you can tell about what's

38:16.320 --> 38:21.360
going on. And really in the end, the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationships

38:21.360 --> 38:28.240
between events? So an event in this sort of an elementary event is a little piece of

38:28.240 --> 38:33.600
hypergraph got rewritten. And that means a few hyper edges of the hypergraph were consumed by

38:33.600 --> 38:39.280
the event and you produce some other hyper edges. And that's an elementary event. And so then the

38:39.280 --> 38:46.000
question is, what we can tell is kind of what the network of causal relationships between elementary

38:46.000 --> 38:52.320
events is. That's the ultimate thing, the causal graph of the universe. And it turns out that,

38:52.320 --> 38:57.600
well, there's this property of causal invariance that is true of a bunch of these models and I

38:57.600 --> 39:05.440
think is inevitably true for a variety of reasons. That makes it be the case that it doesn't matter

39:05.440 --> 39:10.480
kind of if you are sort of saying, well, I've got this hypergraph and I can rewrite this piece here

39:10.480 --> 39:14.320
and this piece here, and I do them all in different orders. When you construct the

39:14.320 --> 39:19.680
causal graph for each of those orders that you choose to do things in, you'll end up with the

39:19.680 --> 39:26.880
same causal graph. And so that's essentially why, well, that's in the end why relativity works.

39:26.880 --> 39:33.360
It's why our perception of space and time is as having this kind of connection that relativity

39:33.360 --> 39:39.440
says they should have. And that's kind of how that works. I think I'm missing a little piece,

39:39.520 --> 39:44.880
if we can go there again. You said the fact that the observer is embedded in this

39:44.880 --> 39:52.400
hypergraph, what's missing? What is the observer not able to state about this universe of space

39:52.400 --> 40:02.400
and time? So if you look from the outside, you can say, oh, I see this particular place was updated

40:02.400 --> 40:07.280
and then this one was updated, and I'm seeing which order things were updated in. But the

40:07.280 --> 40:11.600
observer embedded in the universe doesn't know which order things were updated in because until

40:11.600 --> 40:16.720
they've been updated, they have no idea what else happened. So the only thing they know is the set

40:16.720 --> 40:21.920
of causal relationships. Let me give an extreme example. Let's imagine that the universe is a

40:21.920 --> 40:28.000
Turing machine. Turing machines have just this one update head which does something, and otherwise,

40:28.000 --> 40:32.720
the Turing machine just does nothing. And the Turing machine works by having this head move

40:32.720 --> 40:38.320
around and do its updating just where the head happens to be. The question is, could the universe

40:38.320 --> 40:43.040
be a Turing machine? Could the universe just have a single updating head that's just zipping around

40:43.040 --> 40:48.400
all over the place? You say, that's crazy because I'm talking to you, you seem to be updating,

40:48.400 --> 40:53.280
I'm updating, et cetera. But the thing is, there's no way to know that because if there was just this

40:53.280 --> 40:58.960
head moving around, it's like, okay, it updates me, but you're completely frozen at that point.

40:58.960 --> 41:02.720
Until the head has come over and updated you, you have no idea what happened to me.

41:03.280 --> 41:07.760
And so, if you sort of unravel that argument, you realize the only thing we actually can tell

41:08.320 --> 41:13.680
is what the network of causal relationships between the things that happened were. We don't

41:13.680 --> 41:19.840
get to know from some sort of outside sort of God's eye view of the thing. We don't get to know

41:21.440 --> 41:27.440
from the outside what happened. We only get to know sort of what the set of relationships

41:27.440 --> 41:33.280
between the things that happened actually were. Yeah, but if I somehow record like a trace of this,

41:34.400 --> 41:38.560
I guess would be called multi-computation, can't I then look back?

41:40.560 --> 41:45.040
When you record the trace? You place throughout the universe,

41:45.040 --> 41:53.760
like throughout like a log that records in my own pocket of in this hypergraph, can't I like

41:54.480 --> 41:59.520
realizing that I'm getting an outdated picture? Can't I record?

41:59.520 --> 42:04.720
See, the problem is, and this is where things start getting very entangled in terms of what

42:04.720 --> 42:10.720
one understands. The problem is that any such recording device is itself part of the universe.

42:11.680 --> 42:16.720
So, you don't get to say, you never get to say, let's go outside the universe and go do this.

42:17.440 --> 42:22.880
And that's why, I mean, lots of the features of this model and the way things work

42:22.880 --> 42:29.040
end up being a result of that. So, but what I guess from on a human level, what is the

42:29.040 --> 42:34.160
cost you're paying? What are you missing from not getting an updated picture all the time?

42:34.160 --> 42:36.320
Okay, I understand what you're saying. Yeah, right.

42:37.600 --> 42:44.240
How does consciousness emerge from that? What are the limitations of that observer?

42:44.240 --> 42:50.160
I understand you're getting a delayed picture. Well, there's a bunch of limitations of the

42:50.160 --> 42:54.640
observer, I think. Maybe just explain something about quantum mechanics, because that maybe is

42:54.640 --> 42:59.680
an extreme version of some of these issues, which helps to kind of motivate why one should

42:59.680 --> 43:05.440
sort of think things through a little bit more carefully. So, one feature of this, okay, so

43:06.320 --> 43:11.280
in standard physics, like high school physics, you learn the equations of motion for a ball.

43:11.840 --> 43:18.000
And it says, you throw the ball this angle, this velocity, things will move in this way,

43:18.000 --> 43:23.600
and there's a definite answer. The key story of quantum mechanics is there aren't definite

43:23.600 --> 43:29.040
answers to where does the ball go. There's kind of this whole sort of bundle of possible paths.

43:29.040 --> 43:34.880
And all we say we know from quantum mechanics is certain probabilities for where the ball will end

43:34.880 --> 43:39.200
up. Okay, so that's kind of the core idea of quantum mechanics. So, in our models,

43:40.320 --> 43:45.360
quantum mechanics is not some kind of plug-in add-on type thing. You absolutely cannot get

43:45.360 --> 43:50.240
away from quantum mechanics, because as you think about updating this hypergraph, there isn't just

43:50.240 --> 43:54.480
one sequence of things, one definite sequence of things that can happen. There are all these

43:54.480 --> 43:59.280
different possible update sequences that can occur. You could do this piece of the hypergraph now,

43:59.280 --> 44:04.400
and then this one later, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. All those different paths of history

44:04.400 --> 44:09.920
correspond to these quantum paths in quantum mechanics, these different possible quantum

44:09.920 --> 44:15.920
histories. And one of the things that's kind of surprising about it is they branch. There can be

44:15.920 --> 44:21.360
a certain state of the universe, and it could do this, or it could do that, but they can also merge.

44:21.360 --> 44:27.280
There can be two states of the universe, which the next state they produce is the same for both of

44:27.280 --> 44:31.840
them. And that process of branching and merging is kind of critical. And the idea that they can be

44:31.840 --> 44:36.160
merging is critical and somewhat nontrivial for these hypergraphs, because there's a whole

44:36.160 --> 44:40.000
graph isomorphism story, and there's a whole very elaborate set of mathematics.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.080
And that's where the causal invariance comes in?

44:42.080 --> 44:50.160
Yes, among other things, right. So then what happens is that what one's seeing,

44:50.160 --> 44:54.080
okay, so we've got this thing, it's branching, it's merging, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

44:54.080 --> 45:01.840
Okay, so now the question is, how do we perceive that? Why don't we notice that the universe is

45:01.840 --> 45:06.640
branching and merging? Why is it the case that we just think a definite set of things happen?

45:07.200 --> 45:12.080
Well, the answer is we are embedded in that universe, and our brains are branching and

45:12.080 --> 45:18.080
merging too. And so what quantum mechanics becomes a story of is how does a branching brain

45:18.080 --> 45:24.880
perceive a branching universe? And the key thing is as soon as you say, I think definite things

45:24.880 --> 45:29.680
happen in the universe, that means you are essentially conflating lots of different parts

45:29.680 --> 45:35.440
of history. You're saying, actually, as far as I'm concerned, because I'm convinced that definite

45:35.440 --> 45:40.000
things happen in the universe, all these parts of history must be equivalent. Now it's not obvious

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
that that would be a consistent thing to do. It might be you say all these parts of history are

45:44.000 --> 45:49.120
equivalent, but by golly, moments later, that would be a completely inconsistent point of view.

45:49.120 --> 45:54.480
Everything would have gone to hell in different ways. The fact that that doesn't happen is,

45:54.480 --> 45:59.120
well, that's a consequence of this causal invariance thing. And the fact that that does

45:59.120 --> 46:05.040
happen a little bit is what causes little quantum effects. And if that didn't happen at all,

46:05.040 --> 46:12.160
there wouldn't be anything that is like quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is like in this

46:14.160 --> 46:18.320
bundle of paths. It's a little bit like what happens in statistical mechanics and fluid

46:18.320 --> 46:22.800
mechanics, whatever, that most of the time you just see this continuous fluid. You just see the

46:22.800 --> 46:27.360
world just progressing in this kind of way that's like this continuous fluid. But every so often,

46:27.360 --> 46:31.200
if you look at the exact right experiment, you can start seeing, well, actually, it's made of

46:31.200 --> 46:35.200
these molecules where they might go that way, or they might go this way, and that's kind of

46:35.200 --> 46:42.960
quantum effects. And so this kind of idea of where we're sort of embedded in the universe,

46:42.960 --> 46:48.320
this branching brain is perceiving this branching universe, and that ends up being sort of a story

46:48.320 --> 46:54.080
of quantum mechanics. That's part of the whole picture of what's going on. But I think to come

46:54.080 --> 47:01.600
back to sort of what is the story of consciousness? So in the universe, we've got whatever it is,

47:01.600 --> 47:06.560
10 to the 400 atoms of space, they're all doing these complicated things. It's all a big complicated

47:06.560 --> 47:12.640
irreducible computation. The question is, what do we perceive from all of that? And the answer is

47:12.640 --> 47:20.720
that we are parsing the universe in a particular way. Let me again go back to the gas molecules

47:20.720 --> 47:25.680
analogy. In the gas in this room, there are molecules bouncing around in all kinds of

47:25.680 --> 47:32.960
complicated patterns, but we don't care. All we notice is the gas laws are satisfied,

47:32.960 --> 47:38.480
maybe there's some fluid dynamics. These are kind of features of that assembly of molecules that

47:38.480 --> 47:43.200
we notice, and then lots of details we don't notice. When you say we, do you mean the tools

47:43.200 --> 47:46.880
of physics, or do you mean literally the human brain and its perception system?

47:47.600 --> 47:52.080
Well, okay. So the human brain is where it starts, but we built a bunch of instruments to do a bit

47:52.080 --> 47:56.640
better than the human brain, but they still have many of the same kinds of ideas, their cameras

47:56.640 --> 48:04.240
and their pressure sensors and these kinds of things. At this point, we don't know how to make

48:04.240 --> 48:07.360
fundamentally qualitatively different sensory devices.

48:07.360 --> 48:11.440
Right. So it's always just an extension of the conscious experience.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.600
Or our sensory experience.

48:13.600 --> 48:20.400
Sensory experience that's somehow intricately tied to consciousness.

48:20.400 --> 48:25.040
Right. So one question is when we are looking at all these molecules in the gas, and there might

48:25.040 --> 48:31.360
be 10th to 20th molecules in some little box or something, it's like, what do we notice about

48:31.360 --> 48:38.560
those molecules? So one thing that we can say is we don't notice that much. We are computationally

48:38.560 --> 48:45.200
bounded observers. We can't go in and say, okay, they're 10th to 20th molecules and I know

48:45.200 --> 48:49.120
that I can sort of decrypt their motions and I can figure out this and that. It's like,

48:49.120 --> 48:54.480
I'm just going to say what's the average density of molecules. And so one key feature of us is that

48:54.480 --> 48:59.760
we are computationally bounded. And that when you are looking at a universe which is full of

48:59.760 --> 49:05.840
computation and doing huge amounts of computation, but we are computationally bounded, there's only

49:05.840 --> 49:09.840
certain things about that universe that we're going to be sensitive to. We're not going to be

49:10.480 --> 49:15.200
figuring out what all the atoms of space are doing because we're just computationally bounded

49:15.200 --> 49:22.400
observers and we are only sampling these small set of features. So I think the two defining

49:22.400 --> 49:29.360
features of consciousness that, and I would say that the preamble to this is for years,

49:29.920 --> 49:33.840
as I've talked about sort of computation and fundamental features of physics and science,

49:34.320 --> 49:39.200
people ask me, so what about consciousness? And for years I've said, I have nothing to say

49:39.200 --> 49:44.320
about consciousness. And I've kind of told this story, you talk about intelligence,

49:44.320 --> 49:49.680
you talk about life. These are both features where you say, what's the abstract definition

49:49.680 --> 49:53.280
of life? We don't really know the abstract definition. We know the one for life on Earth,

49:53.280 --> 49:56.320
it's got RNA, it's got cell membranes, it's got all this kind of stuff.

49:56.880 --> 50:01.360
Similarly for intelligence, we know the human definition of intelligence, but what is

50:01.360 --> 50:06.560
intelligence abstractly? We don't really know. And so what I've long believed is that sort of

50:06.560 --> 50:12.160
the abstract definition of intelligence is just computational sophistication. That is, that as

50:12.160 --> 50:18.080
soon as you can be computationally sophisticated, that's kind of the abstract version, the generalized

50:18.080 --> 50:22.800
version of intelligence. So then the question is, what about consciousness? And what I sort

50:22.800 --> 50:28.880
of realized is that consciousness is actually a step down from intelligence. That is, that you

50:28.880 --> 50:36.080
might think, oh, consciousness is the top of the pile, but actually I don't think it is. I think

50:36.080 --> 50:40.080
that there's this notion of kind of computational sophistication, which is the generalized

50:40.080 --> 50:45.840
intelligence. But consciousness has two limitations, I think. One of them is computational

50:45.840 --> 50:51.600
boundedness. That is that we're only perceiving a sort of computationally bounded view of the

50:51.600 --> 50:57.680
universe. And the other is this idea of a single thread of time. That is that we, and in fact,

50:57.680 --> 51:03.280
we know neurophysiologically our brains go to some trouble to give us this one thread of attention,

51:03.280 --> 51:09.600
so to speak. And it isn't the case that in all the neurons in our brains, that at least in our

51:09.600 --> 51:15.680
conscious, the correspondence of language in our conscious experience, we just have the single

51:15.680 --> 51:21.600
thread of attention, single thread of perception. And maybe there's something unconscious that's

51:21.600 --> 51:26.080
bubbling around that's the kind of almost the quantum version of what's happening in our brain,

51:26.080 --> 51:32.000
so to speak. We've got the classical flow of what we are mostly thinking about, so to speak.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.640
But there's this kind of bubbling around of other paths that is all those other neurons that didn't

51:36.640 --> 51:42.960
make it to be part of our sort of conscious stream of experience. So in that sense, intelligence as

51:42.960 --> 51:51.680
computational sophistication is much broader than the computational constraints which

51:52.400 --> 51:57.920
consciousness operates under, and also the sequential thing, like the notion of time.

51:58.960 --> 52:03.440
That's kind of interesting, but then the follow-up question is like, okay, starting to get a sense of

52:03.440 --> 52:07.680
what is intelligence, and how does that connect to our human brain? Because you're saying

52:10.320 --> 52:14.800
intelligence is almost like a fabric, like what, we like plug into it or something?

52:14.800 --> 52:16.240
Yeah, I think, you know, people-

52:16.240 --> 52:18.240
Our consciousness plugs into it?

52:18.240 --> 52:23.520
Yeah, I mean, the intelligence, I think, the core, I mean, you know, intelligence at some

52:23.520 --> 52:28.880
level is just a word, but we are asking, you know, what is the notion of intelligence as we

52:28.880 --> 52:33.760
generalize it beyond the bounds of humans, beyond the bounds of even the AIs that we humans have

52:33.760 --> 52:39.440
built and so on? You know, what is intelligence? You know, is the weather, you know, people say

52:39.440 --> 52:43.200
the weather has a mind of its own. What does that mean? You know, can the weather be intelligent?

52:43.840 --> 52:48.320
Yeah. What does agency have to do with intelligence here? So is intelligence just

52:48.320 --> 52:54.640
like your conception of computation? Just intelligence is the capacity to perform

52:54.640 --> 52:59.840
computation in a sea of- Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think that's right. And I think that,

52:59.840 --> 53:07.120
you know, this question of is it for a purpose, okay, that quickly degenerates into a horrible

53:07.120 --> 53:12.800
philosophical mess because, you know, whenever you say, did the weather do that for a purpose?

53:12.800 --> 53:16.640
Yeah. Right? Well, yes, it did. It was trying to move a bunch of hot air from

53:16.640 --> 53:22.800
the equator to the poles or something. That's its purpose. But why? Because I seem to be equally

53:22.800 --> 53:29.840
as dumb today as I was yesterday. So there's some persistence or like a consistency over time that

53:29.840 --> 53:36.800
the intelligence I plugged into. So like, what's, it seems like there's a hard constraint between

53:36.800 --> 53:41.920
the amount of computation I can perform in my consciousness. Like they seem to be really

53:41.920 --> 53:46.800
closely connected somehow. Well, I think the point is that the thing that gives you kind of

53:46.800 --> 53:55.680
the ability to have kind of conscious intelligence, you can have kind of this, okay, so one thing is

53:55.680 --> 54:02.400
we don't know intelligences other than the ones that are very much like us. Yes. Right? And the

54:02.400 --> 54:07.440
ones that are very much like us, I think, have this feature of single thread of time bounded,

54:07.440 --> 54:13.360
you know, computationally bounded. Now that, but you also need computational sophistication.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.200
Having a single thread of time and being computationally bounded, you could just be

54:17.200 --> 54:22.720
a clock going tick tock, you know, that would satisfy those conditions. But the fact that we

54:22.720 --> 54:30.480
have this sort of irreducible, you know, computational ability, that's an important

54:30.480 --> 54:36.400
feature. That's the sort of the bedrock on which we can construct the things we construct. Now,

54:36.400 --> 54:41.920
the fact that we have this experience of the world that has the single thread of time and

54:41.920 --> 54:49.520
computational boundedness, the thing that I sort of realized is it's that that causes us to deduce

54:49.520 --> 54:55.200
from this irreducible mess of what's going on in the physical world, the laws of physics that we

54:55.200 --> 55:03.520
think exist. So in other words, if we say, why do we believe that there is, you know, continuous space,

55:03.520 --> 55:09.680
let's say, why do we believe that gravity works the way it does? Well, in principle, we could be

55:09.680 --> 55:16.720
kind of parsing details of the universe that were, you know, that involve, okay, the analogy is,

55:17.520 --> 55:24.160
again, with the, you know, statistical mechanics and molecules in a box, we could be sensitive

55:24.160 --> 55:28.400
to every little detail of the swirling around of those molecules. And we could say, what really

55:28.400 --> 55:35.520
matters is the wiggle effect that is something that we humans just never notice because it's

55:35.520 --> 55:40.960
some weird thing that happens when there are 15 collisions of air molecules and this happens

55:40.960 --> 55:47.040
and that happens. We just see the pure motion of a ball moving about. Why do we see that?

55:47.040 --> 55:54.240
Right. And the point is that what seems to be the case is that the things that, if we say, given this

55:54.240 --> 55:59.680
sort of hypergraph that's updating and all the details about all the sort of atoms of space and

55:59.680 --> 56:04.800
what they do, and we say, how do we slice that to what we can be sensitive to? What seems to be the

56:04.800 --> 56:10.880
case is that as soon as we assume, you know, computational boundedness, single thread of time,

56:10.880 --> 56:15.440
that leads us to general relativity. In other words, we can't avoid that. That's the way that

56:15.440 --> 56:22.160
we will parse the universe given those constraints. We parse the universe according to those

56:22.160 --> 56:30.400
particular, in such a way that we say the aggregate reducible sort of pocket of computational

56:30.400 --> 56:37.520
reducibility that we slice out of this kind of whole computationally irreducible ocean of behavior

56:37.520 --> 56:39.760
is just this one that corresponds to general relativity.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.920
Yeah, but we don't perceive general relativity.

56:42.800 --> 56:45.040
Well, we do if we do fancy experiments.

56:45.040 --> 56:47.840
So you're saying so perceive really does mean the full-

56:47.840 --> 56:51.520
We drop something. That's a great example of general relativity in action.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.520
No, but like what's the difference in that and Newtonian mechanics? I mean-

56:55.520 --> 57:02.240
Oh, it doesn't. When I say general relativity, that's just the uber theory, so to speak. I mean,

57:02.240 --> 57:07.680
Newtonian gravity is just the approximation that we can make, you know, on the earth and things

57:07.680 --> 57:14.560
like that. So this is, you know, the phenomenon of gravity is one that is a consequence of,

57:14.560 --> 57:19.360
you know, we would perceive something very different from gravity. So the way to understand

57:19.360 --> 57:27.600
that is when we think about, okay, so we make up reference frames with which we parse what's

57:27.600 --> 57:35.120
happening in space and time. So in other words, one of the things that we do is we say as time

57:35.120 --> 57:41.600
progresses, everywhere in space is something happens at a particular time, and then we go

57:41.600 --> 57:45.520
to the next time, and we say this is what space is like at the next time, this is what space is

57:45.520 --> 57:52.880
like at the next time. It's the reason we are used to doing that is because, you know, when

57:52.880 --> 57:59.120
we look around, we might see, you know, 10, 100 meters away. The time it takes light to travel

57:59.120 --> 58:04.000
that distance is really short compared to the time it takes our brains to know what happened.

58:04.000 --> 58:09.600
So as far as our brains are concerned, we are parsing the universe in this, there is a moment

58:09.600 --> 58:14.320
in time, it's all of space. There's a moment in time, it's all of space. You know, if we were the

58:14.320 --> 58:17.920
size of planets or something, we would have a different perception because the speed of light

58:17.920 --> 58:24.320
would be much more important to us. We wouldn't have this perception that things happen progressively

58:24.320 --> 58:29.920
in time, everywhere in space. And so that's an important kind of constraint. And the reason that

58:29.920 --> 58:35.520
we kind of parse the universe in the way that causes us to say gravity works the way it does

58:35.520 --> 58:41.760
is because we're doing things like deciding that we can say the universe exists, space has a

58:41.760 --> 58:46.800
definite structure. There is a moment in time, space has this definite structure. We move to

58:46.800 --> 58:52.160
the next moment in time, space has another structure. That kind of setup is what lets us

58:52.160 --> 58:58.560
kind of deduce kind of what to parse the universe in such a way that we say gravity works the way

58:58.560 --> 59:05.680
it does. So that kind of reference frame is that the illusion of that is that you're saying that

59:05.680 --> 59:11.680
somehow useful for consciousness. That's what consciousness does. Because in a sense,

59:11.680 --> 59:19.440
what consciousness is doing is it's insisting that the universe is kind of sequentialized.

59:21.040 --> 59:25.520
And it is not allowing the possibility that, oh, there are these multiple threads of time

59:25.520 --> 59:30.480
and they're all flowing differently. It's like saying, no, you know, everything is happening

59:30.480 --> 59:36.160
in this one thread of experience that we have. And that illusion of that one thread of experience

59:36.160 --> 59:41.760
cannot happen at the planetary scale. Are you saying typical human? Are you saying we are at a

59:41.760 --> 59:49.280
human level is special here for consciousness? Well, for our kind of consciousness, if we existed

59:49.280 --> 59:53.600
at a scale close to the elementary length, for example, then our perception of the universe

59:53.600 --> 59:58.720
will be absurdly different. Okay. But this makes consciousness seem like a weird side effect to

59:58.720 --> 01:00:04.160
this particular scale. And so who cares? I mean, the consciousness is not that special.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.600
Look, I think that a very interesting question is, which I've certainly thought a little bit about,

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:16.080
is what can you imagine? What is the sort of factoring of something? What are some other

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.920
possible ways you could exist, so to speak? Right. And if you were a photon, if you were

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:29.600
sort of some kind of thing that was kind of intelligence represented in terms of photons,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.360
for example, the photons we receive in the cosmic microwave background, those photons,

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:40.640
as far as they're concerned, the universe just started. They were emitted 100,000 years after

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.080
the beginning of the universe. They've been traveling at the speed of light. Time stayed

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:50.080
still for them and then they just arrived and we just detected them. So for them, the universe just

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.200
started. And that's a different perception of, that has implications for a very different

01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.080
perception of time. They don't have that single thread that seems to be really important for

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.240
being able to tell a heck of a good story. So we humans tell a story. We can tell a story.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:09.280
Right. We can tell a story. What other kinds of stories can you tell? So a photon is a really

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.560
boring story. Yeah. I mean, so that's a, I don't know if they're a boring story, but I think it's,

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.200
I've been wondering about this and I've been asking friends of mine who are science fiction

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.000
writers and things, have you written stuff about this? And I've got one example, a great

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.720
collection of books from my friend, Rudy Rooker, which were, which I have to say,

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.160
they're books about, that are very informed by a bunch of science that I've done.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:40.880
And the thing that I really loved about them is, in the first chapter of the book, the earth is

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:48.320
consumed by these things he called Nantes, which are nano-bot type things. So the earth is gone

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.000
in the first, but then it comes back. Spoiler alert.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:02:00.400
Yeah, right. That was only a micro spoiler. It's only chapter one. But the thing that is not a real

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:07.280
spoiler alert because it's such a complicated concept, but in the end, the earth is saved by

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.680
this thing called the principle of computational equivalence, which is a kind of a core scientific

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:17.520
idea of mine. And I was just thrilled. I don't read fiction books very often. And I was just

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:22.320
thrilled. I get to the end of this and it's like, oh my gosh, you know, everything is saved by this

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.920
sort of deep scientific principle. Can you, can you maybe elaborate how the

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:31.840
principle of computational equivalence can save a planet?

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.680
That would, that would be a terrible spoiler for me.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.640
That would be a spoiler. Okay. Yeah. But no, but let me say what the

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:45.440
principle of computational equivalence is. So the question is you are, you have a system,

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.160
you have some rule, you can think of its behavior as corresponding to a computation.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:54.480
The question is how sophisticated is that computation? The statement of the principle

01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:00.640
of computational equivalence is as soon as it's not obviously simple, it will be as sophisticated

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:07.280
as anything. And so that has the implication that, you know, rule 30, you know, our brains,

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:12.080
other things in physics, they're all ultimately equivalent in the computations they can do.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.240
And that's what leads to this computational irreducibility idea, because the reason we

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.680
don't get to jump ahead, you know, and out think rule 30 is because we're just computationally

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:27.920
equivalent to rule 30. So we're kind of just both just running computations that are the same sort

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.200
of raw, the same level of computation, so to speak. So that's kind of the idea there.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:40.080
And the question, I mean, it's like the, you know, in the science fiction version would be,

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.120
okay, somebody says, we just need more servers, get us more servers. The way to get even more

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:52.160
servers is turn the whole planet into a bunch of microservers. And that's where it starts.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:56.080
And so the question of, you know, computational equivalence, principle of computational

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.600
equivalence is, well, actually, you don't need to build those custom servers. Actually, you can

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:10.000
just use natural computation to compute things, so to speak. You can use nature to compute.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.680
You don't need to have done all that engineering. I mean, it's kind of feels a little disappointing

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.800
that you say, we're going to build all these servers. We're going to do all these things.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.680
We're going to make, you know, maybe we're going to have human consciousness uploaded into,

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.760
you know, some elaborate digital environment. And then you look at that thing, and you say,

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.040
it's got electrons moving around, just like in a rock. And then you say, well, what's the difference?

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.400
And the principle of computational equivalence says, there isn't, at some level, a fundamental,

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.560
you know, you can't say mathematically there's a fundamental difference between the rock that

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:50.640
is the future of human consciousness and the rock that's just a rock. Now, what I've sort of realized

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:57.840
with this kind of consciousness thing is there is an aspect of this that seems to be more special.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:03.280
That isn't, and for example, something I haven't really teased apart properly is when it comes to

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:07.280
something like the weather and the weather having a mind of its own or whatever, or your average,

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:13.520
you know, pulsar magnetosphere acting like a sort of intelligent thing. How does that relate to,

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:21.520
you know, how is that entity related to the kind of consciousness that we have and sort of what

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.920
would the world look like, you know, to the weather? If we think about the weather as a mind,

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:30.880
what will it perceive? What will its laws of physics be? I don't really know.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.280
Because it's very parallel.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.360
It's very parallel, among other things, and it's not obvious. I mean, this is a really kind of

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:44.400
mind-bending thing because we've got to try and imagine where, you know, we've got to try and

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.040
imagine a parsing of the universe different from the one we have. And by the way, when we think

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.720
about extraterrestrial intelligence and so on, I think that's kind of the key thing is, you know,

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.600
we've always assumed, I've always assumed, okay, the extraterrestrials, at least they have the same

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.760
physics. We all live in the same universe. They've got the same physics. But actually,

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.800
that's not really right because the extraterrestrials could have a completely different

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:14.320
way of parsing the universe. So it's as if, you know, there could be, for all we know,

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.640
right here in this room, you know, in the details of the motion of these gas molecules,

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:25.440
there could be an amazing intelligence that we were like, but we have no way of, we're not parsing

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.680
the universe in the same way. If only we could parse the universe in the right way, you know,

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.800
immediately this amazing thing that's going on and this, you know, huge culture that's developed

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.800
and all that kind of thing would be obvious to us, but it's not because we have our particular way

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:44.080
of parsing the universe. Would that thing also have an agency? I don't know the right word to use,

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.920
but something like consciousness, but a different kind of consciousness?

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.600
I think it's a question of just what you mean by the word because I think that the, you know,

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.720
this notion of consciousness and the, okay, so some people think of consciousness as sort of

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:04.240
a key aspect of it is that we feel that there's sort of a feeling of that we exist in some way,

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:11.200
that we have this intrinsic feeling about ourselves. You know, I suspect that any of

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.040
these things would also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves. I've been sort of trying to

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.240
think recently about constructing an experiment about what if you were just a piece of a cellular

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.480
automaton, let's say, you know, what would your feeling about yourself actually be?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.440
And, you know, can we put ourselves in the shoes in the cells of the cellular automaton, so to speak?

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:37.280
Can we get ourselves close enough to that, that we could have a sense of what the world will be

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:43.120
like if you were operating in that way. And it's a little difficult because, you know, you have to

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.400
not only think about what are you perceiving, but also what's actually going on in your brain.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:54.240
And our brains do what they actually do. And I think there might be some experiments that

01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.400
are possible with neural nets and so on, where you can have something where you can at least see

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:06.000
in detail what's happening inside the system. And I've been sort of one of my projects to think

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.480
about is, is there a way of kind of getting a sense kind of from inside the system about what

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:19.920
its view of the world is and how it, you know, can we make a bridge? See, the main issue is this,

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:25.440
where, you know, it's a sort of philosophically difficult thing because it's like we do what we

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.800
do. We understand ourselves, at least to some extent. We humans understand ourselves.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.840
That's correct. But yet, okay, so what are we trying to do, for example, when we are trying

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.160
to make a model of physics? What are we actually trying to do? Because, you know, you say, well,

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.160
can we work out what the universe does? Well, of course we can. We just watch the universe.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.640
The universe does what it does. But what we're trying to do when we make a model of physics

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:54.160
is we're trying to get to the point where we can tell a story to ourselves that we understand

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.560
that is also a representation of what the universe does. So it's this kind of, you know,

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:03.440
can we make a bridge between what we humans can understand in our minds and what the universe

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:10.560
does? And in a sense, you know, a large part of my kind of life efforts have been devoted

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.200
to making computational language, which kind of is a bridge between what is possible in the

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:20.880
computational universe and what we humans can conceptualize and think about, in a sense what,

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.360
you know, when I built Wolfram Language and our whole sort of computational language story,

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.560
it's all about how do you take sort of raw computation and this ocean of computational

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:36.960
possibility and how do we sort of represent pieces of it in a way that we humans can understand

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.920
and that map onto things that we care about doing. And in a sense, when you add physics,

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.240
you're adding this other piece where we can, you know, mediate it by computer.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.360
Can we get physics to the point where we humans can understand something about what's happening

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.800
in it? And when we talk about an alien intelligence, it's kind of the same story. It's like,

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:02.640
is there a way of mapping what's happening there onto something that we humans can understand?

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:10.000
And, you know, physics in some sense is like our exhibit one of the story of alien intelligence.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.880
It's an alien intelligence in some sense. And what we're doing in making a model of physics

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.000
is mapping that onto something that we understand. And I think, you know, a lot of these other things

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.200
that I've recently been kind of studying, whether it's molecular biology, other kinds of things,

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:34.400
which we can talk about a bit. Those are other cases where we're, in a sense, trying to again

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:40.320
make that bridge between what we humans understand and sort of the natural language of that sort of

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:46.080
alien intelligence in some sense. When you're talking about, just to backtrack a little bit,

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:52.960
about cellular automata, being able to, what's it like to be a cellular automata

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:58.560
in the way that's equivalent to what is it like to be a conscious human being?

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.000
How do you approach that? So is it looking at some subset of the cellular automata,

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.800
asking questions of that subset, like how the world is perceived?

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:19.040
How you, as that subset, like for that local pocket of computation, what are you able to say

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:25.280
about the broader cellular automata? And that somehow then can give you a sense of how to step

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:30.640
outside of that cellular automata. Right. But the tricky part is that that little subset,

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:38.160
what it's doing is it has a view of itself. And the question is, how do you get inside it?

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:44.080
When we, with humans, it's like we can't get inside each other's consciousness.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:51.680
That doesn't really even make sense. It's like there is an experience that somebody is having,

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:58.000
but you can perceive things from the outside, but sort of getting inside it, it doesn't quite make

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.160
sense. And for me, these sort of philosophical issues, and this one I have not untangled, so

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.320
let's be... For me, the thing that has been really interesting in thinking through some of

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.920
these things is when it comes to questions about consciousness or whatever else, it's like when I

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:20.240
can run a program and actually see pictures and make things concrete, I have a much better chance

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.400
to understand what's going on than when I'm just trying to reason about things in a very abstract

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:32.400
way. Yeah, but there may be a way to map the program to your conscious experience. So for

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:37.440
example, when you play a video game, you do a first person shooter, you walk around inside

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:43.200
this entity. It's a very different thing than watching this entity. So if you can somehow

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:50.400
connect more and more, connect this full conscious experience to the subset of the cellular

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.240
automata. Yeah, it's something like that. But the difference in the first person shooter thing is

01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:04.000
your brain and your memory is still remembering. It's hard to... Again, what one's going to get,

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.800
one is not going to actually be able to be the cellular automaton. One's going to be able to

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.120
watch what the cellular automaton does. But this is the frustrating thing that I'm trying to understand

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.560
how to think about being it, so to speak. Okay, so like in virtual reality, there's a concept of

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.880
immersion, like with anything, with video games, with books, there's a concept of immersion. It

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:31.600
feels like over time, if the virtual reality experience is well done and maybe in the future

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:39.200
it'll be extremely well done, the immersion leads you to feel like... You mentioned memories. You

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:45.840
forget that you even ever existed outside that experience. It's so immersive. I mean, you could

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:52.880
argue mathematically that you can never truly become immersed, but maybe you can. Why can't you

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:59.360
merge with the cellular automaton? Aren't you just part of the same fabric? Why can't you just like...

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.280
Well, that's a good question. So let's imagine the following scenario. Let's imagine...

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.040
Then can you return? But then can you return back?

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.280
Well, yeah, right. Let's imagine you've uploaded, your brain is scanned, you've got every synapse

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.960
mapped out. You upload everything about you, the brain simulator. You upload the brain simulator

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:25.040
and the brain simulator is basically some glorified cellular automaton. And then you say,

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.560
well, now we've got an answer to what does it feel like to be a cellular automaton?

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:34.640
It feels just like it felt to be ordinary you because they're both computational systems and

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:39.760
they're both operating in the same way. So in a sense... But I think there's somehow more to it

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.760
because in that sense, when you're just making a brain simulator, it's just... We're just saying

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:50.720
there's another version of our consciousness. The question that we're asking is if we tease away from

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.840
our consciousness and get to something that is different, how do we make a bridge to understanding

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.880
what's going on there? And there's a way of thinking about this. Okay, so this is coming

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:05.360
on to sort of questions about the existence of the universe and so on. But one of the things is

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:11.600
there's this notion that we have of ruleial space. So we have this idea of this physical space,

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:17.600
which is something you can move around in that's associated with the extent of the spatial

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:23.680
hypergraph. Then there's what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches. So in this

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.960
thing we call the multi-way graph of all of this sort of branching histories, there's this idea of

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.840
a kind of space where instead of moving around in physical space, you're moving from history to

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.240
history, so to speak, from one possible history to another possible history. And that's kind of a

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:44.640
different kind of space that is the space in which quantum mechanics plays out. Quantum mechanics,

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.840
like for example, something like... I think we're slowly understanding things like destructive

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.200
interference in quantum mechanics. That what's happening is branchial space is associated with

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.200
phase in quantum mechanics. And what's happening is the two photons that are supposed to be

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.760
interfering and destructively interfering are winding up at different ends of branchial space.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:10.560
And so us, as these poor observers that have branching brains that are trying to conflate

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.960
together these different threads of history and say, we've really got a consistent story that

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.360
we're telling here. We're really knitting together these threads of history. By the time the two

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:24.400
photons wound up at opposite ends of branchial space, we just can't knit them together to tell

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:29.120
a consistent story. So for us, that's sort of the analog of destructive interference.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.280
Got it. And then there's ruleial space too, which is the space of rules.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:40.640
Yes. Well, that's another level up. So there's the question... Actually, I do want to mention

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:44.560
one thing because it's something I've realized in recent times and I think it's really, really

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.040
kind of cool, which is about time dilation and relativity. And it kind of helps to understand...

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.960
It's something that kind of helps in understanding what's going on. So according to relativity,

01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:00.800
if you have a clock, it's ticking at a certain rate, you send it in a spacecraft that's going

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:07.280
at some significant fraction of the speed of light. To you as an observer at rest, that clock

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:13.040
that's in the spacecraft will seem to be ticking much more slowly. And so in other words, it's kind

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:19.280
of like the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri and goes very fast will age much less than the

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:25.280
twin who's on Earth that is just hanging out where they're hanging out. Okay, why does that happen?

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:32.720
Okay, so it has to do with what motion is. So in our models of physics, what is motion? Well,

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:38.800
when you move from somewhere to somewhere, you're having to sort of recreate yourself at a different

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:45.040
place in space. When you exist at a particular place and you just evolve with time, again,

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:49.760
you're updating yourself, you're following these rules to update what happens. Well,

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:54.000
so the question is when you have a certain amount of computation in you, so to speak,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.800
when there's a certain amount, you're computing, the universe is computing at a certain rate,

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.840
you can either use that computation to work out sitting still where you are,

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:09.200
what's going to happen successively in time, or you can use that computation to recreate yourself

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.080
as you move around the universe. And so time dilation ends up being... It's really cool,

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.520
actually, that this is explainable in a way that isn't just imagine the mathematics of relativity.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:26.320
But time dilation is a story of the fact that as you are recreating yourself as you move,

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.000
you are using up some of your computation. And so you don't have as much computation left over

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.800
to actually work out what happens progressively with time. So that means that time is running

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:44.480
more slowly for you because you're using up your computation. Your clock can't tick as quickly

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:48.800
because every tick of the clock is using up some computation, but you already use that computation

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:54.400
up on moving at half the speed of light or something. And so that's why time dilation

01:18:54.400 --> 01:19:01.520
happens. So it's kind of interesting that one can sort of get an intuition about something like that

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:06.320
because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact about the mathematics of special relativity

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.280
and so on. Well, for me, it's a little bit confusing what the you in that picture is,

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:18.320
because you're using up computation. Okay. So we're simply saying the entity

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:25.040
is updating itself according to the way that the universe updates itself. And the question is,

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:32.240
those updates, let's imagine the you is a clock, okay? And the clock is, there's all these little

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:37.760
updates, the hypergraph and a sequence of updates cause the pendulum to swing back the other way

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:45.120
and then swinging back and forth, okay? And all of those updates are contributing

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:52.000
to the pendulum going back and forth or the little oscillator moving, whatever it is, okay? But then

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.960
the alternative is that sort of situation one, where the thing is at rest. Situation two,

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:04.160
where it's kind of moving, what's happening is it is having to recreate itself. At every moment,

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:10.320
the thing is going to have to do the computations to be able to sort of recreate itself at a

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:15.200
different position in space. And that's kind of the intuition behind. So it's either going to

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.840
spend its computation recreating itself at a different position in space, or it's going to

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:28.880
spend its computation doing the sort of doing the updating of the ticking of the clock, so to speak.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:33.360
So the more updating is doing, the less the ticking of the clock update is doing.

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.080
That's right. The more it's having to update because of motion, the less it can update the

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:44.560
clock. Obviously, there's a sort of mathematical version of it that relates to how it actually

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:50.240
works in relativity, but to me, that was sort of exciting to me that it's possible to have a

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:56.720
really mechanically explainable story there. And similarly in quantum mechanics, this notion of

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:01.600
branching brains perceiving branching universes, to me, that's getting towards a sort of mechanically

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:05.360
explainable version of what happens in quantum mechanics, even though it's a little bit mind

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:12.160
bending to see these things about under what circumstances can you successfully knit together

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:17.280
those different threads of history and when do things sort of escape and those kinds of things.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:24.960
But the thing about this physical space and physical space, the main sort of big theory

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:30.320
is general relativity, the theory of gravity, and that tells you how things move in physical space.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:35.680
In branch field space, the big theory is the Feynman path integral, which it turns out tells

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:41.200
you essentially how things move in the space of quantum phases. So it's kind of like motion in

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:48.560
branch field space. And it's kind of a fun thing to start thinking about all these things that we

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:53.200
know in physical space like event horizons and black holes and so on. What are the analogous

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.720
things in branch field space? For example, the speed of light, what's the analog of the speed

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:02.160
of light in branch field space? It's the maximum speed of quantum entanglement. So the speed of

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:08.720
light is a flash bulb goes off here, what's the maximum rate at which the effect of that flash

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:15.680
bulb is detectable moving away in space? So similarly in branch field space, something happens

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:20.320
and the question is how far in this branch field space, in the space of quantum states,

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:25.600
how far away can that get within a certain period of time? And so there's this notion of a maximum

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.040
entanglement speed and that might be observable. That's the thing we've been sort of poking at,

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.200
is might there be a way to observe it even in some atomic physics kind of situation?

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:41.920
Because one of the things that's weird in quantum mechanics is when we study quantum mechanics,

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.960
we mostly study it in terms of small numbers of particles. This electron does this, this thing on

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.080
an ion trap does that and so on. But when we deal with large numbers of particles, kind of all bets

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.800
are off. It's kind of too complicated to deal with quantum mechanics. And so what ends up happening

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:02.320
is, so this question about maximum entanglement speed and things like that may actually play

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:07.600
in one of these, in the sort of story of many-body quantum mechanics and even have some suspicions

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:13.520
about things that might happen even in... One of the things I realized I'd never understood,

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:17.760
and it's kind of embarrassing, but I think I now understand a little better, is when you have

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:22.480
chemistry and you have quantum mechanics, it's like, well, there's two carbon atoms in this

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.880
molecule and we do a reaction and we draw a diagram and we say, this carbon atom ends up

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:31.520
in this place. And it's like, but wait a minute, in quantum mechanics, nothing ends up in a definite

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.600
place. There's always just some wave function for this to happen. How can it be the case

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:39.840
that we can draw these reasonable, it just ended up in this place? And you have to kind of say,

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:44.800
well, the environment of the molecule effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:49.920
to keep it kind of classical. And that's a story that has to do with this whole thing about

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:56.880
measurements have to do with this idea of, can we conclude that something definite happened?

01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:01.200
Because in quantum mechanics, the intrinsic quantum mechanics, the mathematics of quantum

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.960
mechanics is all about, they're just these amplitudes for different things to happen.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.280
Then there's this thing of, and then we make a measurement and we conclude that something

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:15.040
definite happened. And that has to do with this thing, I think about sort of moving about knitting

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.360
together these different threads of history and saying, this is now something where we can

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.520
definitively say something definite happened. In the traditional theory of quantum mechanics,

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:28.800
it's just like, after you've done all this amplitude computation, then this big hammer

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:33.360
comes down and you do a measurement and it's all over. And that's been very confusing. For example,

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:38.800
in quantum computing, it's been a very confusing thing because when you say, in quantum computing,

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:43.200
the basic idea is you're going to use all these separate threads of computation, so to speak,

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.120
to do all the different parts of, try these different factors for an integer or something

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:51.760
like this. And it looks like you can do a lot because you've got all these different threads

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.560
going on. But then you have to say, well, at the end of it, you've got all these threads and every

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:01.600
thread came up with a definite answer, but we got to conflate those together to figure out a definite

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.320
thing that we humans can take away from it, a definite, so the computer actually produced this

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:14.000
output. So having this branch of space and this hypergraph model of physics, do you think it's

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:20.800
possible to then make predictions that are definite about many body quantum mechanical systems?

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:28.560
I think it's likely, yes. But this is, every one of these things, when you go from the underlying

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.960
theory, which is complicated enough and it's, I mean, the theory at some level is beautifully

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.960
simple, but as soon as you start actually trying to, it's this whole question about how do you

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:43.120
bridge it to things that we humans can talk about. It gets really complicated. And this thing about

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:50.080
actually getting it to a definite prediction about a definite thing you can say about chemistry or

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.320
something like this, that's just a lot of work. So I'll give you an example. There's a thing

01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:00.880
called the quantum Zeno effect. So the idea is quantum stuff happens, but then if you make

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:06.960
a measurement, you're freezing time in quantum mechanics. And so it looks like there's a

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:11.760
possibility that with the relationship between the quantum Zeno effect and the way that many

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.520
body quantum mechanics works and so on, maybe, just conceivably, it may be possible to actually

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:22.480
figure out a way to measure the maximum entanglement speed. And the reason we can

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.600
potentially do that is because the systems we deal with in terms of atoms and things,

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:36.320
they're pretty big. A mole of atoms is a lot of atoms, but it's something where when we're

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:41.840
dealing with how can you see 10 to the minus 100, so to speak, well, by the time you've got 10 to

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:48.640
the 30th atoms, you're within a little bit closer striking distance of that. It's not like, oh,

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:55.280
we've just got two atoms and we're trying to see down to 10 to the minus 100 meters or whatever.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:01.360
So I don't know how it will work, but this is a potential direction. And if you can tell, by the

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:06.080
way, if we could measure the maximum entanglement speed, we would know the elementary length.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:11.920
These are all related. So if we get that one number, we just need one number. If we can get

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:18.640
that one number, the theory has no parameters anymore. And there are other places. Well,

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.560
there's another hope for doing that is in cosmology. In this model, one of the features is

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.400
the universe is not fixed dimensional. I mean, we think we live in three-dimensional space,

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:33.520
but this hypergraph doesn't have any particular dimension. It can emerge as something which in

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:38.960
an approximation, it's as if you say, what's the volume of a sphere in the hypergraph where

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:44.400
a sphere is defined as? How many nodes do you get to when you go a distance r away from a given point?

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:51.760
And you can say, well, if I get to about r cubed nodes when I go a distance r away in the hypergraph,

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:56.560
then I'm living roughly in three-dimensional space. But you might also get to r to the point

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:06.160
2.92 for some value of r. As r increases, that might be the sort of fit to what happens.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.400
And so one of the things we suspect is that the very early universe was essentially infinite

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:17.200
dimensional, and that as the universe expanded, it became lower dimensional. And so one of the

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:22.160
things that is another little sort of point where we think there might be a way to actually

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:27.120
measure some things is dimension fluctuations in the early universe. That is, is there a

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.480
leftover dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic microwave background, 100,000 years

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.040
or something after the beginning of the universe? Is it still the case that there were pieces of

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:42.560
the universe that didn't have dimension three, that had dimension 3.01 or something? And can we

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:50.080
tell that? Is that possible to observe fluctuations in dimensions? I don't even know what that

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:56.400
entails. Okay. So the question, which should be an elementary exercise in electrodynamics,

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:02.080
except it isn't, is understanding what happens to a photon when it propagates through 3.01

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:09.120
dimensional space. So for example, the inverse square law is a consequence of the surface area

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:15.520
of a sphere is proportional to R squared. But if you're not in three dimensional space,

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:21.440
the surface area of sphere is not proportional to R squared. It's R to the whatever, 2.01 or

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:29.600
something. And so that means that I think when you can try and do optics, a common principle in

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:36.640
optics is Huygens principle, which basically says that every piece of a wave front of light

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:41.680
is a source of new spherical waves. And those spherical waves, if they're different dimensional

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:48.240
spherical waves, will have other characteristics. And so there will be bizarre optical phenomena,

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:55.040
which we haven't figured out yet. So you're what, looking for some weird photon trajectories

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:02.480
that designate that as 3.01 dimensional space? Yeah. Yeah. That would be an example of, I mean,

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:06.000
you know, there are only a certain number of things we can measure about photons.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.560
We can measure their polarization, we can measure their frequency, we can measure their direction,

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:18.320
those kinds of things. And how that all works out. And in the current models of physics,

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:24.160
it's been hard to explain how the universe manages to be as uniform as it is. And that's

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:30.800
led to this inflation idea that to the great annoyance of my then collaborator, we figured

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:35.840
out in like 1979, we had this realization that you could get something like this. But it seemed

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.000
implausible that that's the way the universe worked. So we put in a footnote. And that was,

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:46.320
so that's a, but in any case, I've never really completely believed it. But this, that's an idea

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:50.560
for how to sort of puff out the universe faster than the speed of light, early moments of the

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:56.560
universe, that that's the sort of the inflation idea. And that you can somehow explain how the

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:03.200
universe manages to be as uniform as it is. In our model, this turns out to be much more natural,

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:08.800
because the universe just starts very connected. The hypergraph is not such that the ball that you

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:14.640
grow starting from a single point has volume R cubed, it might have volume R to the 500 or R

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:20.400
to the infinity. And so that means that you sort of naturally get this much higher degree of

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:25.360
connectivity and uniformity in the universe. And then the question is, this is sort of the

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:29.840
mathematical physics challenge, is in the standard theory of the universe, there's the

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:33.920
Fridman Robertson-Walker universe, which is the kind of standard model where the universe is

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:38.560
isotropic and homogeneous. And you can then work out the equations of general relativity,

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.640
and you can figure out how the universe expands. We would like to do the same kind of thing,

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:47.280
including dimension change. This is just difficult mathematical physics. I mean,

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:51.360
the reason it's difficult is the sort of fundamental reason it's difficult. When

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:58.240
people invented calculus 300 years ago, calculus was a story of understanding change and change

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:03.120
as a function of a variable. And so people study univariate calculus, they study multivariate

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:09.600
calculus, it's one variable, it's two variables, three variables. But whoever studied 2.5 variable

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:17.200
calculus, turns out nobody. But what we need to have to understand these fractional dimensional

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:24.880
spaces, which don't work like, well, they're spaces where the effective dimension is not

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:30.560
an integer. So you can't apply the tools of calculus naturally and easily to fractional

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.440
dimensions. So somebody has to figure out how to do that. Yeah, yeah, we're trying to figure this

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:40.240
out. I mean, it's very interesting. I mean, it's very connected to very frontier issues in

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:46.880
mathematics. It's very beautiful. So is it possible? We're dealing with a scale that's

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:53.600
so much smaller than our human scale. Is it possible to make predictions versus explanations?

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.880
Do you have a hope that with this hypergraph model, you'd be able to make predictions

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:05.840
that then could be validated with a physics experiment, predictions that couldn't have been

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.600
done or weren't done otherwise? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, I think-

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.960
In which domain do you think that prediction? Okay, so they're going to be cosmology ones to

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.040
do with dimension fluctuations in the universe. That's a very bizarre effect. Dimension

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:21.760
fluctuation is just something nobody ever looked for that. If anybody sees dimension fluctuation,

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:28.400
that's a huge flag that something like our model is going on. And how one detects that,

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.320
you know, that's a problem of kind of, you know, that's a problem of traditional physics in a

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:38.800
sense of what's the best way to actually figure that out. And for example, that's one, there are

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:44.400
all kinds of things one can imagine. I mean, there are things that in black hole mergers,

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.440
it's possible that there will be effects of maximum entanglement speed in large black hole

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:55.280
mergers. That's another possible thing. And all of that is detected through like what?

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:59.360
Do you have a hope for LIGO type of situation? Like that's gravitational waves?

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:06.560
Yeah. Or alternatively, I mean, I think it's, you know, look, figuring out experiments is like

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.040
figuring out technology inventions. That is, you know, you've got a set of raw materials,

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:15.280
you've got an underlying model, and now you've got to be very clever to figure out, you know,

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.960
what is that thing I can measure that just somehow, you know, leverages into the right place?

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:27.200
And we've spent less effort on that than I would have liked. Because one of the reasons is that I

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:34.160
think that the physicists who've been working on our models, we've now lots of physicists,

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:39.600
actually, it's very, very nice. It's kind of, it's one of these cases where I'm almost, I'm really

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:44.000
kind of pleasantly surprised that the sort of absorption of the things we've done has been

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:48.720
quite rapid and quite sort of, you know, very positive.

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:51.760
So it's a Cambrian explosion of physicists too, not just ideas.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:57.200
Yes. I mean, you know, a lot of what's happened that's really interesting, and again, not what

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:03.680
I expected is there are a lot of areas of sort of very elaborate, sophisticated mathematical physics,

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:08.320
whether that's causal set theory, whether it's higher category theory, whether it's

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:13.120
categorical quantum mechanics, all sorts of elaborate names for these things, spin networks,

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:18.720
perhaps, you know, causal dynamical triangulations, all kinds of names of these

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:23.360
fields. And these fields have a bunch of good mathematical physicists in them who've been

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.960
working for decades in these particular areas. And the question is, but they've been building

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.360
these mathematical structures. And the mathematical structures are interesting, but they don't

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:38.320
typically sit on anything. They're just mathematical structures. And I think what's happened is our

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:44.400
models provide kind of a machine code that lives underneath those models. So a typical example,

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:50.480
this is due to Jonathan Gorard, who's one of the key people who's been working on our project.

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:56.080
This is in, okay, so I'll give you an example just to give a sense of how these things connect.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:02.880
This is in causal set theory. So the idea of causal set theory is there are, in space-time,

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:07.360
we imagine that there's space and time. It's a three plus one dimensional, you know,

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:13.920
set up. We imagine that there are just events that happen at different times and places in

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:19.520
space and time. And the idea of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:24.240
there are a bunch of events that happen sort of randomly at different places in space and time.

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:29.520
And then the whole sort of theory of physics has to be to do with this graph of causal

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:36.000
relationships between these randomly thrown down events. So they've always been confused by the

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.040
fact that to get even Lorentz invariance, even relativistic invariance, you need a very special

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:46.240
way to throw down those events. And they've had no natural way to understand how that would happen.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:53.600
So what Jonathan figured out is that, in fact, from our models, instead of just generating

01:36:53.600 --> 01:37:00.960
events at random, our models necessarily generate events in some pattern in space-time effectively

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.480
that then leads to Lorentz invariance and relativistic invariance and all those kinds of

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:08.000
things. So it's a place where all the mathematics that's been done on, well,

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.600
we just have a random collection of events. Now what consequences does that have in terms of

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:18.720
causal set theory and so on? That can all be kind of wheeled in now that we have some different

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:24.240
underlying foundational idea for what the particular distribution of events is as opposed

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.200
to just where we throw down random events. And so that's a typical sort of example of what we're

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:34.720
seeing in all these different areas of kind of how you can take really interesting things

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.040
that have been done in mathematical physics and connect them. And it's really kind of beautiful

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:45.840
because the sort of the abstract models we have just seem to plug into all these different,

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:51.360
very interesting, very elegant abstract ideas. But we're now giving sort of a reason for that

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:58.480
to be the way, for a reason for one to care. I mean, it's like saying you can think about

01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:03.280
computation abstractly. You can think about, I don't know, combinators or something as abstract

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.320
computational things. And you can sort of do all kinds of study of them. But it's like, why do we

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:12.320
care? Well, okay, Turing machines are a good start because you can kind of see they're sort of

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.280
mechanically doing things. But when we actually start thinking about computers computing things,

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:21.840
we have a really good reason to care. And this is sort of what we're providing, I think,

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:26.640
is a reason to care about a lot of these areas of mathematical physics. So that's been very nice.

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:33.120
CB So I'm not sure we've ever got to the question of why does the universe exist at all.

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:40.160
RL No, let's talk about that. So it's not the simplest question in the world. So it takes a

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:43.760
few steps to get to it. CB And it's nevertheless even surprising

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.720
that you can even begin to answer this question, as you were saying.

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:54.400
RL I'm very surprised. So the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of ruleial space.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:00.240
So we've got kind of physical space, we've got branchial space, the space of possible quantum

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.760
histories. And now we've got another level of kind of abstraction, which is ruleial space.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:12.400
And here's where that comes from. So you say, okay, you say we've got this model for the universe,

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:18.560
we've got a particular rule, and we run this rule and we get the universe. Okay, so that's

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:24.400
interesting. Why that rule? Why not another rule? And so that confused me for a long time.

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:30.080
And I realized, well, actually, what if the thing could be using all possible rules? What

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:36.560
if at every step, in addition to saying apply a particular rule at all places in this hypergraph,

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:41.600
one could say, just take all possible rules and apply all possible rules at all possible places

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:47.680
in this hypergraph, okay? And then you make this ruleial multi-way graph, which both is all

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:52.720
possible histories for a particular rule and all possible rules. So the next thing you'd say is,

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:58.320
how can you get anything reasonable out of, how can anything real come out of the set of all

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.840
possible rules applied in all possible ways? Okay, this is a subtle thing, which I haven't fully

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:10.320
untangled. There is this object, which is the result of running all possible rules in all

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:14.240
possible ways. And you might say, if you're running all possible rules, why can't everything

01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:21.840
possible happen? Well, the answer is because when there's sort of this entanglement that occurs,

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:27.280
so let's say that you have a lot of different possible initial conditions, a lot of different

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:32.480
possible states, then you're applying these different rules. Well, some of those rules

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:36.560
can end up with the same state. So it isn't the case that you can just get from anywhere to

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.760
anywhere. There's this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what, and there's a definite

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:46.240
structure that's produced. I think I'm going to call that definite structure the ruleiad,

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:52.000
the limit of all possible rules being applied in all possible ways.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.120
And you're saying that structure is finite, so that somehow connects to maybe a similar kind

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.080
of thing as like causal invariance. Well, it happens that the ruleiad necessarily has causal

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:08.640
invariance. That's just a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rules plus

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:14.960
universal computation gives you the fact that from any diverging paths, the paths will always

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:20.960
converge. But does that necessarily infer that the ruleiad is finite?

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:28.720
In the end, it's not necessarily finite. Just like the history of the universe may not be finite,

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:33.280
the history of the universe time may keep going forever. You can keep running the computations

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.320
of the ruleiad and you'll keep spewing out more and more and more structure. It's like time doesn't

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:45.920
have to end. But the issue is there are three limits that happen in this ruleiad object.

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:52.080
One is how long you run the computation for. Another is how many different rules you're applying.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:57.280
Another is how many different states you start from. And the mixture of those three limits,

01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:03.920
this is just mathematically a horrendous object. And what's interesting about this object is

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:08.160
the one thing that does seem to be the case about this object is it connects with ideas in higher

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:13.280
category theory. And in particular, it connects to some of the 20th century's most abstract

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:18.480
mathematics done by this chap, Grothendieck. Grothendieck had a thing called the infinity

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:24.960
groupoid, which is closely related to this ruleiad object. Although the details of the relationship,

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:31.920
you know, I don't fully understand yet. But I think that what's interesting is this thing

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.120
that is sort of this very limiting object. So, okay, so a way to think about this that, again,

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.320
will take us into another direction, which is the equivalence between physics and mathematics.

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:49.840
The way that, well, let's see, maybe this is just to give a sense of this kind of

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.320
groupoid and things like that. You can think about in mathematics, you can think you have

01:42:54.320 --> 01:43:01.040
certain axioms, they're kind of like atoms, and you, well, actually, let's say, let's talk

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.600
about mathematics for a second. So what is mathematics? What is it made of, so to speak?

01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:12.320
Mathematics, there's a bunch of statements, like for addition, x plus y is equal to y plus x. That's

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.960
a statement of mathematics. Another statement would be, you know, x squared minus one is equal

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:21.840
to x plus one, x minus one. There are an infinite number of these possible statements of mathematics.

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:27.520
I mean, it's not just, I guess, a statement, but with x plus y, it's a rule that you can,

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:35.760
I mean, you think of it as a rule. It is a rule. It's also just a thing that is true in mathematics.

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.680
Right. It's a statement of truth. Okay.

01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:44.000
Right. And what you can imagine is you imagine just laying out this giant kind of ocean

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.680
of all statements. Well, actually, you first start, okay, this is where this was segueing

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:52.240
into a different thing. Let me not go in this direction for a second.

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.400
Let's not go to meta-mathematics just yet. Yeah, we'll maybe get to meta-mathematics,

01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:01.280
but it's, so let me explain the groupoid and things later.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:04.320
Yes. But so let's come back to the universe,

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:09.280
always a good place to be in, so to speak. Yeah, so what does the universe have to do

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:16.080
with the rule-y add, the rule-y all space, and how that's possibly connected to why the thing

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.880
exists at all and why there's just one of them? Yes. Okay. So here's the point.

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.640
So the thing that had confused me for a long time was let's say we get the rule for the universe,

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:30.480
we hold it in our hand, we say, this is our universe. Then the immediate question is,

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:37.120
well, why isn't it another one? And that's kind of the sort of the lesson of Copernicus is we're

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:44.880
not very special. So how come we got universe number 312 and not universe quadrillion, quadrillion,

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:52.320
quadrillion? And I think the resolution of that is the realization that the universe is running all

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:58.960
possible rules. So then you say, well, how on earth do we perceive the universe to be running

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.360
according to a particular rule? How do we perceive definite things happening in the universe? Well,

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:10.080
it's the same story. It's the observer, there is a reference frame that we are picking in this rule-y

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:15.840
space and that that is what determines our perception of the universe. With our particular

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:22.320
sensory information and so on, we are parsing the universe in this particular way. So here's the way

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:28.080
to think about it. In physical space, we live in a particular place in the universe. And we could

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:35.680
live in Alpha Centauri, but we don't, we live here. And similarly in rule-y space, we could live in

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.920
many different places in rule-y space, but we happen to live here. And what does it mean to

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.040
live here? It means we have certain sensory input. We have certain ways to parse the universe.

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:51.360
Those are our interpretation of the universe. What would it mean to travel in rule-y space?

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:56.240
What it basically means is that we are successively interpreting the universe in different ways. So

01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:01.520
in other words, to be at a different point in rule-y space is to have a different, in a sense,

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.480
a different interpretation of what's going on in the universe. And we can imagine even things

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:11.520
like an analog of the speed of light as the maximum speed of translation in rule-y space and

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:19.280
so on. So wait, what's the interpretation? So rule-y space and we is, I'm confused by the

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.520
we and the interpretation and the universe. I thought moving about in rule-y space changes

01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:32.080
the way the universe is. The way we would perceive it.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:40.320
So it ultimately has to do with the perception. So it doesn't, rule-y space is not somehow

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:45.600
changing, like branching into another universe or something like that.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:53.200
No, I mean, the whole point of this is the rule-yard is sort of the encapsulated version

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:56.800
of everything that is the universe running according to all possible rules.

01:46:56.800 --> 01:47:04.480
We think of our universe, the observable universe as its thing. So we're a little bit loose with

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:11.760
the word universe then, because wouldn't the rule-y add potentially encapsulate a very large

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:19.520
number, like combinatorially large, maybe infinite set of what we human physicists think of as

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:20.160
universes?

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:25.680
That's an interesting parsing of the word universe, right? Because what we're saying is,

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.600
just as we're at a particular place in physical space, we're at a particular place in rule-y space,

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.800
at that particular place in rule-y space, our experience of the universe is this.

01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:38.560
Just as if we lived at the center of the galaxy, our universe, our experience of the universe will

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:43.920
be different from the way it is given where we actually live. And so what we're saying is,

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:50.240
our, when you might say, I mean, in a sense, this rule-y add is sort of a super universe,

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.920
so to speak, but it's all entangled together. It's not like you can separate out. You can say,

01:47:55.920 --> 01:48:00.800
let me, it's like when we take a reference, okay, it's like our experience of the universe

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.280
is based on where we are in the universe. We could imagine moving to somewhere else in the

01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.880
universe, but it's still the same universe.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:11.520
So there's not like universes existing in parallel?

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:19.440
No, because, and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of what's

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:25.200
going on, we could perceive a different reference frame in this rule-y add.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:32.320
Yeah, but that's not, that's just, yeah, that's the same rule-y add. That's the same universe.

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:35.680
You're just moving about. These are just coordinates in the universe.

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:40.960
So the way that's, the reason that's interesting is imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence. So

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:47.200
the alien intelligence, we should say. The alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri,

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:50.160
but it might also live at a different place in rule-y all space.

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.000
It can live right here on earth. It just has a different reference frame that

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:00.080
includes a very different perception of the universe. And then because that rule-y all space

01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:05.520
is very large, I mean, do we get to communicate with them?

01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:14.720
Yeah, but it's also, well, one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be.

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:20.720
I think it could be bizarrely, unimaginably completely different. And I mean, one thing to

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:27.120
realize is even in kind of things I don't understand well, I know about the kind of

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:32.560
Western tradition of understanding science and all that kind of thing. And you talk to people who

01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:39.360
say, well, I'm really into some Eastern tradition of this, that, and the other.

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:46.480
And it's really obvious to me how things work. I don't understand it at all, but it is not obvious,

01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:50.960
I think, with this kind of realization that there's these very different ways to interpret

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:55.360
what's going on in the universe. That kind of gives me at least, it doesn't help me to understand

01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.080
that different interpretation, but it gives me at least more respect for the possibility that

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:04.080
there will be other interpretations. Yeah, it humbles you to the possibility that,

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:09.760
like, what is it, reincarnation or all these, like, eternal recurrence with Nietzsche,

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.720
like, just these ideas. Yeah. Well, you know, the thing that I realized about a bunch of those

01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:18.880
things is that, you know, I've been sort of doing my little survey of the history of philosophy,

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.360
just trying to understand, you know, what can I actually say now about some of these things?

01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:28.560
And you realize that some of these concepts, like the immortal soul concept, which, you know,

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:34.080
I remember when I was a kid and, you know, it was kind of lots of religion bashing type stuff

01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:38.880
of people saying, you know, well, we know about physics, tell us how much does a soul weigh?

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.000
And people are like, well, how can it be a thing if it doesn't weigh anything?

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:49.520
Well, now we understand, you know, there is this notion of what's in brains that isn't the matter

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:54.640
of brains, and it's something computational. And there is a sense, and in fact, it is correct,

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:59.440
that it is in some sense, immortal, because this pattern of computation is something abstract

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:05.520
that is not specific to the particular material of a brain. Now, we don't know how to extract it,

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:11.040
you know, in our traditional scientific approach, but it's still something where it isn't a crazy

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:16.080
thing to say there is something doesn't weigh anything. That's a kind of a silly question.

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:21.280
How much does it weigh? Well, actually, maybe it isn't such a silly question in our model of physics,

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:26.400
because the actual computational activity has a consequence for gravity and things,

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:31.120
but that's a very subtle- You can talk about mass and energy and so on. There could be a,

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.160
what would you call it, a solitron. Yes, yes, yes.

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:41.520
A particle that somehow contains soulness. Yeah, right. Well, that's what, by the way,

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:45.920
that's what Leibniz said. And, you know, one thing I've never understood this, you know,

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:50.640
Leibniz had this idea of monads and monodology, and he had this idea that what exists in the

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:55.840
universe is this big collection of monads and that they, that the only thing that one knows about

01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:59.920
the monads is sort of how they relate to each other, which sounds awfully like hypergraphs,

01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:05.600
right? But Leibniz had really lost me at the following thing. He said, each of these monads

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:10.800
has a soul and each of them has a consciousness. And it's like, okay, I'm out of here. I don't

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:16.080
understand this at all. I don't know what's going on. But I realized recently that in his day,

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:22.000
the concept that a thing could do something, could spontaneously do something, that was his

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:28.000
only way of describing that. And so what I would now say as well as this abstract rule that runs,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.440
to Leibniz, that would have been, you know, in 1690 or whatever, that would have been kind of,

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:38.960
well, it has a soul, it has a consciousness. And so, you know, in a sense, it's like one of these,

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:43.440
there's no new idea under the sun, so to speak. That's, you know, that's a sort of a version of

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:48.560
the same kinds of ideas, but couched in terms that are sort of bizarrely different from the

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:54.160
ones that we would use today. Would you be able to maybe play devil's advocate on your conception

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:59.360
of consciousness that, like the two characteristics of it, that is constrained and there's a

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:07.600
single thread of time? Is it possible that Leibniz was onto something that the basic atom,

01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:14.160
the screwy atom of space has a consciousness? Is that, so these are just words, right? But

01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:21.600
is there some sense where consciousness is much more fundamental than you're making it seem?

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:24.000
I don't know. I mean, you know, I think-

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.800
Can you construct a world in which it is much more fundamental?

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:32.800
I think that, okay, so the question would be, is there a way to think about, kind of,

01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:38.640
if we sort of parse the universe down at the level of atoms of space or something,

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:42.160
could we say, well, so that's really a question of a different point of view,

01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:45.440
a different place in real space. We're asking, you're asking the question,

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:52.480
could there be a civilization that exists? Could there be sort of conscious entities

01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:56.880
that exist at the level of atoms of space? And what would that be like? And I think that comes

01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:00.560
back to this question of can we, you know, what's it like to be a cellular automaton type thing?

01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:08.240
I mean, it's, you know, I'm not yet there. I don't know. I mean, I think that this is a,

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:14.640
and I don't even know yet quite how to think about this in the sense that I was considering,

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:18.880
you know, I never write fiction, but I haven't written it since I was like 10 years old.

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:23.120
My fiction, I made one attempt, which I sent to some science fiction writer friends of mine,

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:25.520
and they told me it was terrible. So, but-

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.720
This is a long time ago?

01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:27.840
No, it was recently.

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:33.120
They said it was terrible. That'd be interesting to see you write a short story based on what

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:38.720
sounds like it's already inspiring short stories by, or stories by science fiction writers.

01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:43.360
But I think the interesting thing for me is, you know, in the, what does it,

01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:47.360
what is it like to be a whatever? How do you describe that? I mean, it's like,

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:51.680
that's not a thing that you describe in mathematics, that what is it like to be such and such?

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:57.600
Well, see, to me, when you say what is it like to be something presumes that you're talking

01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:08.320
about a singular entity. So, yeah, like there's a, some kind of feeling of the entity,

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:13.120
the stuff that's inside of it and the stuff that's outside of it. And then

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:21.280
that's when consciousness starts making sense. But then it seems like that could be generalizable.

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:27.200
If you take some subset of a cellular automata, you could start talking about

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:33.360
does that subset feel, but then you can, I think you could just take arbitrary

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:41.760
numbers of subsets. Like to me, like you and I individually are consciousnesses,

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.680
but you could also say the two of us together is a singular conscious.

01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:49.840
Maybe, maybe. I'm not so sure about that. I think that the single thread of time thing

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.800
may be pretty important. And that as soon as you start saying there are two different threads

01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:59.280
of time, there are two different experiences. And then we have to say, how do they relate?

01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:03.520
How are they sort of entangled with each other? I mean, that may be a different story of a thing

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:08.960
that isn't much like, you know, what do the ants, you know, what's it like to be an ant,

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:13.840
you know, where there's a sort of more collective view of the world, so to speak? I don't know.

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:20.800
I think that, I mean, this is, you know, I don't really have a good, I mean,

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:26.800
my best thought is, you know, can we turn it into a human story? It's like the question of,

01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:30.400
you know, when we try and understand physics, can we turn that into something which is sort

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:35.760
of a human understandable narrative? And now what's it like to be a such and such? You know,

01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:40.720
maybe the only medium in which we can describe that is something like fiction, where it's kind

01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:48.480
of like you're telling, you know, the life story in that setting. But this is beyond what I've

01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:53.280
yet understood how to do. Yeah, but it does seem so, like with human consciousness, you know,

01:56:53.280 --> 01:57:01.120
we're made up of cells and like, there's a bunch of systems that are networked that work together

01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:06.960
that at this, at the human level, feel like a singular consciousness when you take. Yes.

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:13.840
And so maybe like an ant colony is just too low level. Sorry, an ant is too low level. Right.

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.400
Maybe you have to look at the ant colony. Yeah, I agree. There's some level at which

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:23.840
it's a conscious being. And then if you go to the planetary scale, then maybe that's going too far.

01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:30.400
So there's a nice sweet spot for consciousness. I agree. I think the difficulty is that,

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:36.960
you know, okay, so in sort of people who talk about consciousness, one of the terrible things

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:40.800
I've realized, because I've now interacted with some of this community, so to speak,

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:45.680
some interesting people who do that kind of thinking. But, you know, one of the things I

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:51.600
was saying to one of the leading people in that area, I was saying, you know, that, you know,

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:56.560
it must be kind of frustrating because it's kind of like a poetry story. That is many people are

01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:00.960
writing poems, but few people are reading them. Yes. So there are always these different, you know,

01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:06.880
everybody has their own theory of consciousness, and they are very non inter sort of inter

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:12.640
discussable. And by the way, I mean, you know, my own approach to sort of the question of

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.120
consciousness, as far as I'm concerned, I'm an applied consciousness operative, so to speak,

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:22.400
because I don't really, in a sense, the thing I'm trying to get out of it is how does it help me to

01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:28.800
understand what's a possible theory of physics? And how does it help me to say, how do I go from

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:34.000
this, this incoherent collection of things happening in the universe to our definite

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.880
perception and definite laws and so on, and sort of an applied version of consciousness? And I

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:44.000
think the reason it sort of segues to a different kind of topic, but the reason that one of the

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.480
things I'm particularly interested in is kind of what's the analog of consciousness in systems

01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:54.640
very different from brains? And so why does that matter? Well, you know, this whole description

01:58:54.640 --> 01:59:00.080
of this kind of, you know, we haven't talked about why the universe exists. So let's get

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:05.360
to why the universe exists. And then we then we can can talk about perhaps a little bit about

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:10.880
what these models of physics kind of show you about other kinds of things like molecular

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:16.000
computing and so on. Yes, that's good. Why does the universe exist? Okay, so we finally sort of

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:21.120
more or less set the stage, we've got this idea of this rulliad of this object that is made from

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:26.640
following all possible rules, the fact that it's sort of not just this incoherent mess, it's got

01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:34.560
all this entangled structure in it, and so on. Okay. So what is this rulliad? Well, it is the

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:39.680
working out of all possible formal systems. So the sort of the question of why does the

01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:45.200
universe exist? Its core question, we kind of started with is, you've got two plus two equals

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:52.480
four, you've got some other abstract results, but that's not actualized. It's just an abstract thing.

01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:56.160
And when we say we've got a model for the universe, okay, it's this rule, you run it,

01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:00.800
and it'll make the universe, but it's like, but you know, where's it actually running?

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:09.520
What is it actually doing, right? Is it actual or is it merely a formal description of something?

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:16.400
Okay. So the thing to realize with this, the thing about the rulliad is it's an inevitable,

02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:23.280
it is the entangled running of all possible rules. So you don't get to say, it's not like you're

02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:29.520
saying, which rulliad are you picking? Because it's all possible formal rules. It's not like it's

02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:36.160
just, you know, well, actually, it's only footnote. The only footnote, it's an important footnote, is

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:43.600
it's all possible computational rules, not hyper computational rules. That is, it's running all the

02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:50.880
rules that would be accessible to a Turing machine, but it is not running all the rules that will be

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:55.600
accessible to a thing that can solve problems in finite time that would take a Turing machine

02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:00.800
infinite time to solve. So you can, even Alan Turing knew this, that you could make oracles for

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:05.040
Turing machines where you say a Turing machine can't solve the halting problem for Turing machines.

02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:09.760
It can't know what will happen in any Turing machine after an infinite time, in any finite

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:15.600
time, but you could invent a box, just make a black box. You say, I'm going to sell you an oracle

02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:19.200
that will just tell you, you know, press this button, it'll tell you what the Turing machine

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:23.920
will do after an infinite time. You can imagine such a box. You can't necessarily build one in

02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:29.040
the physical universe, but you can imagine such a box. And so we could say, well, in addition to,

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:36.320
so in this Ruliat, we're imagining that there is a computational, that at the end, it's running

02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:42.880
rules that are computational. It doesn't have a bunch of oracle black boxes in it. You say, well,

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:49.360
why not? Well, it turns out if there are oracle black boxes, the Ruliat that is, you can make a

02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:54.560
sort of super Ruliat that contains those oracle black boxes, but it has a cosmological event

02:01:54.560 --> 02:02:00.480
horizon relative to the first one. They can't communicate. In other words, you can end up with

02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:05.360
what you end up happening. What ends up happening is it's like in the physical universe,

02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:09.920
in this causal graph that represents the causal relationships of different things,

02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:16.400
you can have an event horizon where the causal graph is disconnected, where the effect here,

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.800
an event happening here does not affect an event happening here because there's a disconnection in

02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:26.480
the causal graph. And that's what happens in an event horizon. And so what will happen between

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:34.480
this kind of the ordinary Ruliat and the hyper Ruliat is there is an event horizon. And we,

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:42.000
in our Ruliat, we'll just never know that they're just separate things. They're not

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
connected. Maybe I'm not understanding, but just because we can't observe it,

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:55.040
why does that mean it doesn't exist? It might exist, but it's not clear what it is. So what,

02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:00.560
so to speak, whether it exists. What we're trying to understand is why does our universe exist?

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:08.160
We're not trying to ask the question what, let me say another thing. Let me make a meta comment,

02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:14.240
okay? Which is that I have not thought through this hyper Ruliat business properly. So I can't.

02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:22.560
The hyper Ruliat is referring to a Ruliat in which hyper computation is possible.

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:23.600
That's correct. Yes.

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:33.200
Okay. So like that footnote, the footnote to the footnote is we're not sure why this is important.

02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:40.160
Yeah, that's right. So let's ignore that, okay? It's already abstract enough, okay? So okay,

02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:46.720
so the one question is we have to say, if we're saying why does the universe exist,

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:49.840
one question is why is it this universe and not another universe?

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:50.080
Yeah.

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:57.680
Okay? So the important point about this Ruliat idea is that it's in the Ruliat are all possible

02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:03.760
formal systems. So there's no choice being made. There's no like, oh, we pick this particular

02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:09.440
universe and not that one. That's the first thing. The second thing is that we have to ask the

02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:17.040
question. So you say, why does two plus two equals four exist? That's not really a, that is a thing

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:23.280
that necessarily is that way just on the basis of the meaning of the terms two and plus and equals

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:30.800
and so on, right? So the thing is that this Ruliat object is in a sense a necessary object.

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:36.400
It is just the thing that is the consequence of working out the consequence of the formal

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:42.960
definition of things. It is not a thing where you're saying, and this is picked as the particular

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:49.440
thing. This is just something which necessarily is that thing because of the definition of what

02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:53.840
it means to have computations. So the Ruliat, it's a formal system.

02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:54.720
Yes.

02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:57.920
But does it exist?

02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:09.360
Ah, well, where are we in this whole thing? We are part of this Ruliat. And so there is no sense

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:18.160
to say does two plus two equals four exist? Well, that's in some sense, it necessarily exists. It's

02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:25.040
a necessary object. It's not a thing that way you can ask. Usually in philosophy, there's a sort of

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:31.040
distinction made between necessary truths, contingent truths, analytic propositions,

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:34.640
synthetic propositions. There are a variety of different versions of this. There are things

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:40.320
which are necessarily true just based on the definition of terms, and there are things which

02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:48.000
happen to be true in our universe. But we don't exist in Rulial space. That's one of the coordinates

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:55.760
that define our existence, right? Well, okay. So yes, but this Ruliat is the

02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:01.520
set of all possible Rulial coordinates. So what we're saying is it contains that. So what we're

02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:08.080
saying is we exist as, okay, so our perception of what's going on is we're at a particular place

02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:12.960
in this Ruliat, and we are concluding certain things about how the universe works based on that.

02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:19.760
But the question is, do we understand, you know, is there something where we say,

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:27.840
so why does it work that way? Well, the answer is, I think it has to work that way, because

02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:35.440
this Ruliat is a necessary object in the sense that it is a purely formal object,

02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:41.440
just like two plus two equals four. It's not an object that was made of something. It's an object

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:46.560
that is just an expression of the necessary collection of formal relations that exist.

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:54.720
And so then the issue is, can we, in our experience of that, is it, you know, can we have tables and

02:06:54.720 --> 02:07:00.720
chairs, so to speak, in that just by virtue of our experience of that necessary thing?

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:06.320
And, you know, what people have generally thought, and honestly, I don't know of a lot of

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:10.400
discussion of this, why does the universe exist question. It's been a very,

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:15.360
you know, I've been surprised actually at how little, I mean, I think it's one of these things

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:24.000
that's really kind of far out there. But the thing that is, you know, the surprise here is that all

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.880
possible formal rules, when you run them together, and that's the critical thing,

02:07:28.880 --> 02:07:33.920
when you run them together, they produce this kind of entangled structure that has a definite

02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:38.960
structure. It's not just, you know, a random arbitrary thing. It's a thing with definite

02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:45.520
structure. And that structure is the thing when we are embedded in that structure, when anything,

02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:52.320
you know, an entity embedded in that structure perceives something, which is then we can

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:56.400
interpret as physics and things like this. So in other words, we don't have to ask the question,

02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:03.440
why does it exist? It necessarily exists. I'm missing this part. Why does it necessarily

02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:11.920
exist? Okay, okay. You need to have it if you want to formalize the relation between entities, but

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:19.760
why did why do you need to have relations? Okay, okay. So let's say you say,

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:28.640
well, it's like, why does math have to exist? Okay. That's the question. Yeah. Okay. Fair question.

02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:36.160
Let's see. I think the thing to think about is the existence of mathematics is something where

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:43.440
given a definition of terms, what follows from that definition inevitably follows.

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:54.080
So now you can say, why define any terms? But in a sense, the, well, that's okay. So the definition

02:08:54.080 --> 02:09:01.520
of terms, I mean, I think the way to think about this, let me see. So like concrete terms.

02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:06.080
Well, they're not very concrete. I mean, they're just things like, you know,

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.920
logical or. Right, but that's a thing. That's a powerful thing.

02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:19.680
Well, it's a, yes, okay. But it's a, the point is that it is not a thing of a, you know,

02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:26.880
people imagine there is, I don't know, the, you know, an elephant or something, or the, you know,

02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:34.080
elephants are presumably not necessary objects. They are, they happen to exist as a result of

02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:41.440
kind of biological evolution and whatever else. But the, the thing is that in some sense that

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:48.320
there is, it is a different kind of thing to say, does plus exist. The, the, it's not, it's not,

02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:54.080
not like an elephant. So a plus is, seems more fundamental, more basic than an elephant. Yes.

02:09:54.080 --> 02:10:02.960
But you can imagine a world without plus or anything like it. Like why do formal things

02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:09.360
that are discreet, that can be used to reason have to exist or.

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:15.840
Well, okay. So why, okay. So then the question is, but the whole point is computation. We can

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:21.680
certainly imagine computation. That is, we can certainly say there is a formal system that we

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:30.080
can construct abstractly in our minds that is computation. And that, that's the, you know,

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:36.720
we can, we can imagine it, right? Now the question is, is it is that formal system.

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:43.520
Once we exist as observers embedded in that formal system, that's enough to have something

02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:50.800
which is like our universe. And so then the, then what you're kind of asking is perhaps is why

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:57.840
the point is we definitely can imagine it. There's nothing that says that we're not saying that

02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:05.040
there's, it's sort of inevitable that, that is a thing that we can imagine. We don't have to ask,

02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:11.040
does it exist? We're just, it is definitely something we can imagine. Now that's, then we

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:17.600
have this thing that is a formally constructible thing that we can imagine. And now we have to ask

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:25.280
the question what, you know, given that formally constructible thing, what is, what consequences

02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:31.120
does that, if we were to perceive that formally, if we were embedded in that formally constructible

02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:38.320
thing, what would we perceive about the world? And we would say we perceive that the world exists

02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:42.400
because we are, we are seeing all of this mechanism of all these things happening.

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:47.760
And, but that's something that is just a feature of it's, it's, it's something where we are.

02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:54.080
See, another way of asking this that I'm trying to get at, I understand why it feels like

02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:04.960
this a ruley ad is necessary, but maybe it's just me being human, but it feels like then

02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:12.160
you should be able to not us, but somehow step outside of the ruley ad. Like what's

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:18.560
outside the ruley ad? Well, the ruley ad is all formal systems. So there's nothing because-

02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:21.600
But that's what a human would say. I know that's what a human would say,

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:26.480
because we're used to the idea that there are, there's, but the whole point is that by the time

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:34.400
it's all possible formal systems, it's, it's like, it is all things you can imagine, but-

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:37.920
No, all computations you can imagine, but like we don't-

02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:45.360
Well, so the issue is, can we encode? Okay. So that's a fair question. Is it possible

02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:53.360
to encode all, I mean, once we, is there something that isn't what we can represent formally?

02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:53.600
Right.

02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:59.280
That is, if there's something that, and that's, I think, related to the hyper ruley ad footnote,

02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:06.080
so to speak, of them, which I'm afraid that the, one of the things sort of interesting about this

02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.480
is, you know, there has been some discussion of this in theology and things like that,

02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:20.720
but, which I don't necessarily understand all of, but the key sort of new input is this idea

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:26.240
that all possible formal systems, it's like, you know, if you make a world, people say,

02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:30.880
well, you make a world with a particular, in a particular way, with particular rules,

02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:35.680
but no, you don't do that. You can make a world that deals with all possible rules,

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:42.320
and then merely by virtue of living in a particular place in that world, so to speak,

02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:46.480
we have the perception we have of what the world is like. Now, I have to say,

02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:53.200
it's sort of interesting because I've, you know, I wrote this piece about this and I, you know,

02:13:53.200 --> 02:14:00.160
this philosophy stuff is not super easy, and I've, as I'm talking to you about it, and I actually

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:03.200
haven't, you know, people have been interested in lots of different things we've been doing,

02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:09.040
but this, why does the universe exist, has been, I would say, one of the ones that you would think

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:14.640
people will be most interested in, but actually, I think they're just like, oh, that's just something

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:21.040
complicated that, so I haven't explained it as much as I've explained a bunch of other things,

02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:27.760
and I have to say, I think I may be missing a couple of pieces of that argument that would be,

02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.320
so it's kind of like- Well, your conscious being is

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:34.880
computationally bounded, so you're missing- Indeed.

02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:40.400
Having written quite a few articles yourself, you're now missing some of the pieces.

02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:42.640
Yes, right. That's the limitation of being human.

02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:49.040
Right. One of the consequences of this why the universe exists thing and this kind of concept of

02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:54.480
really adds and, you know, places in there representing our perception of the universe

02:14:54.480 --> 02:15:00.960
and so on, one of the weird consequences is if the universe exists, mathematics must also exist,

02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:07.200
and that's a weird thing because mathematics, people have been very confused, including me,

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:15.360
have been very confused about the question of kind of what is the foundation of mathematics?

02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.480
What is, what kind of a thing is mathematics? Is mathematics something where we just write

02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:25.440
down axioms like Euclid did for geometry and we just build the structure and we could have written

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:29.680
down different axioms and we'd have a different structure, or is it something that has a more

02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:35.200
fundamental sort of truth to it? And I have to say, this is one of these cases where I've long

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:38.800
believed that mathematics has a great deal of arbitrariness to it, that there are particular

02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:43.680
axioms that kind of got written down by the Babylonians, and, you know, that's what we've

02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:48.160
ended up with the mathematics that we have. And I have to say, actually, my wife has been telling

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:52.080
me for 25 years, she was a mathematician, she's been telling me, you're wrong about the

02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:57.600
foundations of mathematics. And, you know, I'm like, no, no, no, I know what I'm talking about.

02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:03.760
And finally, she's much more right than I've been. So it's one of the-

02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:09.920
So, I mean, her sense and your sense, are we just, so this is to the question of

02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:14.000
metamathematics, are we just kind of on a trajectory through

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:18.640
ruleial space, except in mathematics, through a trajectory of certain kind of-

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:24.320
I think that's partly the idea. So I think that the notion is this. So a hundred years ago,

02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:28.080
a little bit more than a hundred years ago, well, people have been doing mathematics for ages,

02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:34.400
but then in the late 1800s, people decided to try and formalize mathematics and say, you know,

02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:38.400
it is mathematics is, you know, we're going to break it down, we're going to make it like logic,

02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:42.480
we're going to make it out of out of sort of fundamental primitives. And that was people

02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:48.480
like Frager and Piano and Hilbert and so on. And they kind of got this idea of let's do kind

02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:52.480
of Euclid, but even better, let's just make everything just in terms of this sort of

02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:58.320
symbolic axioms and then build up mathematics from that. And that, you know, they thought at

02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:03.920
the time, as soon as they get these symbolic axioms, that they made the same mistake, the kind

02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:09.280
of computational irreducibility mistake. They thought as soon as we've written down the axioms,

02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:13.840
then it'll just, we'll just have a machine, kind of a super-mathematica, so to speak,

02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:19.120
that can just grind out all true theorems of mathematics. That got exploited by Gödel's

02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.680
theorem, which is basically the story of computational irreducibility. It's that even

02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:29.600
though you know those underlying rules, you can't deduce all the consequences in any finite way.

02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:34.480
And so, so that was, but now the question is, okay, so they broke mathematics down into these

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:41.360
axioms. And they say, now you build up from that. So what I'm increasingly coming to realize is

02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:47.600
that's similar to saying, let's take a gas and break it down into molecules. There's gas laws

02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:52.640
that are the large-scale structure and so on that we humans are familiar with. And then there's the

02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:58.240
underlying molecular dynamics. And I think that the axiomatic level of mathematics, which we can

02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:03.040
access with automated theorem proving and proof assistance and these kinds of things, that's the

02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:08.560
molecular dynamics of mathematics. And occasionally we see through to that molecular dynamics.

02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.640
We see undecidability. We see other things like this. One of the things I've always found very

02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:19.280
mysterious is that Gödel's theorem shows that there are sort of things which cannot be finitely

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:23.360
proved in mathematics. There are proofs of arbitrary length, infinite length proofs that

02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:28.160
you might need. But in practical mathematics, mathematicians don't typically run into this.

02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:32.640
They just happily go along doing their mathematics. And I think what's actually

02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:38.160
happening is that what they're doing is they're looking at this. They are essentially observers

02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:45.440
in meta-mathematical space. And they are picking a reference frame in meta-mathematical space.

02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:49.200
And they are computationally bounded observers in meta-mathematical space,

02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:55.600
which is causing them to deduce that the laws of meta-mathematics and the laws of mathematics,

02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:00.560
like the laws of fluid mechanics, are much more understandable than this underlying molecular

02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:07.280
dynamics. And so what gets really bizarre is thinking about kind of the analogy between

02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:16.960
meta-mathematics, this idea of you exist in this sort of space of possible, in this kind of

02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:23.280
mathematical space where the individual kind of points in the mathematical space are statements

02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:28.000
in mathematics, and they're connected by proofs, where one statement, you know, you take a couple

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.680
of different statements, you can use those to prove some other statement, and you've got this

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:37.040
whole network of proofs. That's the kind of causal network of mathematics, of what can prove what,

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:43.360
and so on. And you can say at any moment in the history of a mathematician, of a single

02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:50.800
mathematical consciousness, you are in a single kind of slice of this kind of meta-mathematical

02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:55.760
space. You know a certain set of mathematical statements. You can then deduce with proofs,

02:19:55.760 --> 02:20:00.160
you can deduce other ones, and so on. You're kind of gradually moving through meta-mathematical

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:06.880
space. And so it's kind of the view is that the reason that mathematicians perceive mathematics,

02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:11.440
to have the sort of integrity and lack of kind of undecidability and so on that they do,

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:16.640
is because they, like we as observers of the physical universe, we have these limitations

02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:21.280
associated with computational boundedness, single thread of time, consciousness limitations

02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:26.000
basically, that the same thing is true of mathematicians perceiving sort of meta-mathematical

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.560
space. And so what's happening is that when you look at, if you look at one of these formalized

02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:36.240
mathematics systems, something like, you know, Pythagoras' theorem, it'll be, it'll take, oh,

02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:43.120
I don't know, what is it, maybe 10,000 individual little steps to prove Pythagoras' theorem.

02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:47.680
And one of the bizarre things that's sort of an empirical fact that I'm trying to understand a

02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:51.440
little bit better, if you look at different proof assist, if you look at different formalized

02:20:51.440 --> 02:20:56.480
mathematics systems, they actually have different axioms underneath that they can all prove Pythagoras'

02:20:56.480 --> 02:21:01.760
theorem. And so in other words, it's a little bit like what happens with gases. We can have air

02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:06.240
molecules, we can have water molecules, but they still have fluid dynamics. Both of them have fluid

02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:10.640
dynamics. And so similarly, at the level that mathematics, that mathematicians care about

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:15.600
mathematics, it's way above the molecular dynamics, so to speak. And there are all kinds

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:19.520
of weird things like, for example, one thing I was realizing recently is the quantum theory

02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:25.600
of mathematics. That's a very bizarre idea. But basically, when you prove what is, you know,

02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:30.480
a proof is you've got one statement in mathematics, you go through other statements, you eventually

02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:35.760
get to a statement you're trying to prove, for example, that's a path in meta-mathematical space.

02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:41.360
And that's a single path. A single proof is a single path. But you can imagine there are other

02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:47.280
proofs of the same result. There are a bundle of proofs. There's this whole set of possible proofs.

02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:50.880
You could think of it as branching similar to the quantum mechanics model that you were talking

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:55.360
about. Exactly. And then there's some invariance that you can formalize in the same way that you

02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:59.600
can for the quantum mechanical. Right. So the question is in proof space, you know, as you

02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:04.560
start thinking about multiple proofs, are there analogs of, for example, destructive interference

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:09.680
of multiple proofs? So here's a bizarre idea. It's just a couple of days old, so not yet fully

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:15.440
formed. But as you try and do that, when you have two different proofs, it's like two photons going

02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:20.240
in different directions, you have two proofs which at an intermediate stage are incompatible.

02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:24.880
And that's kind of like destructive interference. Is it possible for this to instruct the

02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:29.760
engineering of automated proof systems? Absolutely. I mean, as a practical matter,

02:22:29.840 --> 02:22:34.880
I mean, you know, this whole question, in fact, Jonathan Gorard has a nice heuristic for automated

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:40.880
theorem provers that's based on our physics project that is looking for essentially using

02:22:40.880 --> 02:22:48.080
kind of using energy and in our models, energy is kind of level of activity in this

02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:54.160
hypergraph. And so there's sort of a heuristic for automated theorem proving about how do you pick

02:22:54.160 --> 02:23:00.640
which path to go down that is based on essentially physics. And I mean, the thing

02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:05.440
that gets interesting about this is the way that one could sort of have the interplay between,

02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:10.640
like for example, a black hole. What is a black hole in mathematics? So the answer is, what is

02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:15.920
black hole in physics? A black hole in physics is where in the simplest form of black hole, time

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:21.600
ends. That is all, you know, everything is crunched down to the space-time singularity,

02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:26.800
and everything just ends up at that singularity. So in our models, and that's a little hard to

02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:31.200
understand general relativity with continuous mathematics, and what does singularity look like?

02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:35.360
In our models, it's something very pragmatic. It's just, you're applying these rules, time is

02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:40.800
moving forward. And then there comes a moment where the rules, no rules apply. So time stops.

02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:46.320
It's kind of like the universe dies. You know, nothing happens in the universe anymore. Well,

02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:51.360
in mathematics, that's a decidable theory. That's a theory. So theories which have

02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:56.400
undecidability, which are things like arithmetic, set theory, all the serious models, theories in

02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:00.480
mathematics, they all have the feature that there are proofs of arbitrarily long length.

02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:06.000
In something like Boolean algebra, which is a decidable theory, there are, you know, any

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.160
question in Boolean algebra, you can just go crunch, crunch, crunch, and in a known number of

02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:15.600
steps, you can answer it. You know, satisfiability, you know, might be hard, but it's still a bounded

02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:21.520
number of steps to answer any satisfiability problem. And so that's the notion of a black hole

02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:28.720
in physics where time stops. That's analogous to in mathematics, where there aren't infinite length

02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:34.480
proofs, where when in physics, you know, you can wander around the universe forever if you don't

02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:38.960
run into a black hole. If you run into a black hole and time stops, you're done. And it's the

02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:43.920
same thing in mathematics between decidable theories and undecidable theories. That's an

02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:49.760
example. And I think we're sort of the attempt to understand. So another question is kind of what

02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:56.720
is the general relativity of meta-mathematics? What is the bulk theory of meta-mathematics?

02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:01.040
So in the literature of mathematics, there are about three million theorems that people

02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:07.920
have published. And those represent, it's kind of on this, it's like on the earth, we would be,

02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:13.440
you know, we've put cities in particular places on the earth, but yet there is ultimately, you know,

02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:17.920
we know the earth is roughly spherical and there's an underlying space. And we could just

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:22.720
talk about, you know, the world of space in terms of where our cities happen to be, but there's

02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:27.360
actually an underlying space. And so the question is, what's that for meta-mathematics? And as we

02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:32.080
kind of explore what is, for example, for mathematics, which is always likes taking sort

02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:37.440
of abstract limits. So an obvious abstract limit for mathematics to take is the limit of the future

02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:43.120
of mathematics. That is what will be, you know, the ultimate structure of mathematics.

02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:46.960
And one of the things that's an empirical observation about mathematics that's quite

02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:52.240
interesting is that a lot of theories in one area of mathematics, algebraic geometry or something

02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:58.480
might have, they play into another area of mathematics. That same kind of fundamental

02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:03.520
construct seem to occur in very different areas of mathematics. And that's structurally captured

02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:08.080
a bit with category theory and things like that. But I think that there's probably an understanding

02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:13.440
of this meta-mathematical space that will explain why different areas of mathematics ultimately

02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:18.400
sort of map into the same thing. And I mean, you know, my little challenge to myself is what's time

02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:25.360
dilation in, in meta-mathematics. In other words, as you, as you basically, as you move around in

02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:31.360
this mathematical space of possible statements, you know, what's, how does that moving around,

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:36.240
it's basically what's happening is that as you move around in the space of mathematical statements,

02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:41.120
it's like you're changing from algebra to geometry to whatever else. And you're trying to prove the

02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:46.800
same theorem. But as you try, if you keep on moving to these different places, it's slower to prove

02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:50.080
that theorem because you keep on having to translate what you're doing back to where you

02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:54.640
started from. And that's kind of the beginnings of the analog of time dilation in meta-mathematics.

02:26:54.640 --> 02:26:57.440
Plus there's probably fractional dimensions in this space as well.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.960
Oh, this space is a very messy space. This space is much messier than physical space. I mean,

02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:08.320
even in, even in the models of physics, physical space is very tame compared to

02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:12.880
branchial space and ruleial space. I mean, the mathematical structure, you know,

02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:16.640
branchial space is probably more like Hilbert space, but it's a rather complicated Hilbert space.

02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:24.320
And ruleial space is more like this weird infinity groupoid story of growth and deacon. And,

02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:29.040
you know, I can explain that a little bit because in, you know, in meta-mathematical space,

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:36.320
a path in meta-mathematical space is a path between two statements is a way to get by

02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:42.160
proofs, is a way to find a proof that goes from one statement to another. And so one of the things

02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:46.800
you can do, you can think about is you've got, between statements, you've got proofs. They are

02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:52.000
paths between statements. Okay. So now you can go to the next level and you can ask, what about a

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.360
mapping from one proof to another? And so that's in category theory, that's kind of a higher

02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:02.560
category, notion of higher categories where you're, where you're mapping not just between,

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:07.360
not just between objects, but you're mapping between the mappings between objects and so on.

02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:12.160
And so you can keep doing that. You keep saying higher order proofs. I want mappings between

02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:17.360
proofs, between proofs and so on. And that limiting structure, oh, by the way, one thing that's very

02:28:17.360 --> 02:28:22.160
interesting is imagine in proof space, you've got these two proofs. And the question is,

02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.480
what is the topology of proof space? In other words, if you take these two paths,

02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:31.040
can you continuously deform them into each other? Or is there some big hole in the middle that

02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:35.040
prevents you from continuously deforming them one into the other? It's kind of like, you know,

02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:39.200
when you, when you think about some, I don't know, some puzzle, for example, you're moving pieces

02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:44.000
around on some puzzle and you can think about the space of possible states of the puzzle.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:48.080
And you can make this graph that shows from one state of the puzzle to another state of the puzzle

02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:53.120
and so on. And sometimes you can easily get from one state to any other state, but sometimes there'll

02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:58.800
be a hole in that space. And there'll be, you know, you always have to go around the circuitous route

02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.680
to get from here to there. There won't be any direct way. That's kind of a question of,

02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:08.560
of whether there's sort of an obstruction in the space. And so the question is in proof space,

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:14.640
what is the, what are, you know, what does it mean if there's an obstruction in proof space?

02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:20.080
Yeah. I don't even know what an obstruction means in proof space. Cause for it to be an obstruction,

02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:26.320
it should be reachable some other way from some other place, right? So this is like an unreachable

02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:31.520
part of the graph. No, it's not just an unreachable part. It's a part where there are paths that go

02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:35.440
one way. There are paths that go the other way. And this question of homotopy and mathematics

02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:40.240
is this question, can you continuously deform, you know, from one path to another path,

02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:44.560
or do you have to go in a, in a jump, so to speak? So it's like if you're going around a sphere,

02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:49.360
for example, if you're going around, I don't know, a cylinder or something, you can wind around one

02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:55.360
way and you can, there's no, there are paths where you can easily deform one path into another,

02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:58.960
because it's just sort of sitting on the same side of the cylinder. But when you've got something

02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:03.280
that winds all the way around a cylinder, you can't continuously deform that down to a point

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:07.360
because it's, it's stuck wrapped around. Well, my intuition about proof space is you should be

02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:10.880
able to deform it. I mean that, cause then otherwise it doesn't even make sense. Cause

02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:17.200
if the topology matters of the way you move about the space that I don't even know what that means.

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:21.840
Well, what it would mean is that you would have one way of doing a proof of something

02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:26.560
over here in algebra and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry.

02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:32.080
And there would not be an intermediate way to map between those proofs. How would that be possible

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:37.120
if they started the same place and ended the same place? Well, it's the same thing as, you know,

02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:42.080
we've got points on a, you know, if we've got paths on a cylinder. I understand how it works

02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:46.240
in physical space, but it just doesn't, it feels like proof space shouldn't have that.

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:51.920
Okay. I mean, I'm not sure. I don't know. We'll know very soon because we get to do some experiments.

02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:56.960
This is the great thing about this stuff is that in fact, you know, I'm in the next few days,

02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:01.040
I hope to do a bunch of experiments on this. So you're playing with like proofs and in this

02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:06.960
kind of space. Yes. Yes. I mean, so, you know, this is toy, you know, theories and, you know,

02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:11.680
we've got good. So this kind of segues to perhaps another thing, which is this whole idea of

02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:20.640
multi-computation. So this is another kind of bigger idea that, so, okay, this has to do with

02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:27.280
how do you make models of things? And it's going to, so I've sort of claimed that there've been sort

02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:34.880
of four epochs in the history of making models of things. And this multi-computation thing is

02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:40.560
the fourth, there's a new epoch. What are the first three? The first one is back in antiquity,

02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:46.000
ancient Greek times, people were like, what's the universe made of? Oh, it's made of, you know,

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:51.920
everything is water, Thales, you know, or everything is made of atoms. It's sort of, what are things

02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:57.440
made of? Or the, you know, there are these crystal spheres that represent where the planets are and

02:31:57.440 --> 02:32:02.400
so on. It's like a structural idea of how the universe is constructed. There's no real notion

02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:08.480
of dynamics. It's just what is the universe, how is the universe made? Then we get to the 1600s

02:32:08.480 --> 02:32:12.800
and we get to the sort of revolution of mathematics being introduced into physics.

02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:20.000
And then we have this kind of idea of you write down some equation, the, what happens in the

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:25.120
universe is the solving of that equation. Time enters, but it's usually just a parameter. We

02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:30.800
just can, you know, sort of slide it back and forth and say, here's where it is. Okay. Then we

02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:38.080
come to this kind of computational idea that I kind of started really pushing in the early 1980s

02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:41.600
as a result, you know, the things we were talking about before about complexity,

02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:47.040
that was my motivation. But the biggest story was the story of kind of computational models of things.

02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:51.680
And the big difference there from the mathematical models is in mathematical models,

02:32:51.680 --> 02:32:56.320
there's an equation, you solve it, you kind of slide time to the place where you want it.

02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:03.680
In computational models, you give the rule and then you just say, go run the rule. And time

02:33:03.680 --> 02:33:07.920
is not something you get to slide. Time is something where it just, you run the rule,

02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:13.680
time goes in steps. And that's how you work out what, how the system behaves. You don't,

02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:19.120
time is not just a parameter. Time is something that is about the running of these rules.

02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:23.040
And so there's this computational irreducibility. You can't jump ahead in time,

02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:27.760
but there's still, important thing is there's still one thread of time. It's still the case,

02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:32.080
you know, the cellular automaton state, then it has the next state and the next state and so on.

02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:36.960
The thing that is kind of, we've sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics in a sense, although

02:33:36.960 --> 02:33:42.400
it actually feeds back even into relativity and things like that, that there are these multiple

02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:48.400
threads of time. And so in this multi-computation paradigm, the kind of idea is instead of there

02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:53.440
being this single thread of time, there are these kind of distributed asynchronous threads of time

02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:58.240
that are happening. And the thing that's sort of different there is if you want to know what

02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:03.280
happened, if you say what happened in the system, in the case of the computational paradigm,

02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:09.840
you just say, well, after a thousand steps, we got this result, right? But in the multi-computational

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:13.600
paradigm, after a thousand steps, not even clear what a thousand steps means, because you've got

02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:18.880
all these different threads of time, but there is no state. There's all these different possible,

02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:22.800
you know, there's all these different paths. And so the only way you can know what happened

02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:28.000
is to have some kind of observer who is saying, here's how to parse the results of what was going

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.240
on. Right. But that observer is embedded and they don't have a complete picture. So-

02:34:32.240 --> 02:34:39.360
In the case of physics, that's right. Yes. But so the idea is that in this multi-computation setup,

02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:44.320
that it's this idea of these multiple threads of time and models that are based on that.

02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:49.600
And this is similar to what people think about in non-deterministic computation.

02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:53.200
So you have a Turing machine, usually it has a definite state, it follows another state,

02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:56.960
follows another state. But typically what people have done when they've thought about these kinds

02:34:56.960 --> 02:35:00.880
of things is they've said, well, there are all these possible paths. A non-deterministic Turing

02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:05.200
machine can follow all these possible paths, but we just want one of them. We just want the one

02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:10.160
that's the winner that factors the number or whatever else. And similarly, it's the same story

02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:15.440
in logic programming and so on. But we say, we've got this goal, find us a path to that goal. I just

02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:20.400
want one path, then I'm happy. Or theorem proving, same story. I just want one proof and then I'm

02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:26.320
happy. What's happening in multi-computation in physics is we actually care about many paths.

02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:30.880
And well, there is a case, for example, probabilistic programming is a version of

02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:34.960
multi-computation in which you're looking at all the paths, you're just asking for probabilities,

02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:40.720
of things. But in a sense, in physics, we're taking different kinds of samplings. For example,

02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:44.960
in quantum mechanics, we're taking a different kind of sampling of all these multiple paths.

02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:51.680
But the thing that is notable is that when you are an observer embedded in this thing,

02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:56.080
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, with various other sort of footnotes and so on,

02:35:56.080 --> 02:36:02.400
it is inevitable that the thing that you parse out of the system looks like general relativity

02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:07.760
and quantum mechanics. In other words, that just by the very structure of this multi-computational

02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:16.720
setup, it inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent laws. Now, why is this perhaps

02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:21.760
not surprising? In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, there are sort of inevitable emergent

02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:28.720
laws of sort of gas dynamics that are independent of the details of molecular dynamics, sort of the

02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:33.440
same kind of thing. But I think what happens is, what's a sort of a funny thing that I've

02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:39.840
just been understanding very recently is when I kind of introduced this whole sort of computational

02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:45.760
paradigm complexity-ish thing back in the 80s, it was kind of like a big downer because there's a

02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:50.560
lot of stuff you can't say about what systems will do. And then what I realized is, and then you might

02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:55.440
say, now we've got multi-computation, it's even worse. It isn't just one thread of time that we

02:36:55.440 --> 02:37:00.080
can't explain. It's all these threads of time. We can't explain anything. But the following thing

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:06.560
happens. Because there is all this irreducibility, and any detailed thing you might want to answer,

02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:12.080
it's very hard to answer. But when you have an observer who has certain characteristics like

02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:18.720
computational boundedness, sequentiality of time, and so on, that observer only samples certain

02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:24.160
aspects of this incredible complexity going on in this multi-computational system. And that observer

02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:29.920
is sensitive only to some underlying core structure of this multi-computational system.

02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:35.600
There is all this irreducible computation going on, all these details. But to that kind of observer,

02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:41.520
what's important is only the core structure of multi-computation, which means that observer

02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:48.080
observes comparatively simple laws. And I think it is inevitable that that observer observes laws

02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:52.480
which are mathematically structured, like general relativity and quantum mechanics,

02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:55.760
which, by the way, are the same law in our model of physics.

02:37:55.760 --> 02:38:01.600
So that's an explanation why there are simple laws that explain a lot for this observer.

02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:07.840
Potentially, yes. But the place where this gets really interesting is there are all these fields

02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:12.880
of science where people have kind of gotten stuck, where they say, we'd really love to have a physics

02:38:12.880 --> 02:38:17.280
like theory of economics. We'd really love to have a physics like law and linguistics.

02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:23.680
We've got to talk about molecular biology here. So where does multi-computation come in for

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:26.480
biology? Economics is super interesting too, but biology-

02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:29.280
Okay. Let's talk about that. So let's talk about chemistry for a second.

02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:36.480
So I have to say, it's such a weird business for me because there are these kind of paradigmatic

02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.720
ideas and then the actual applications. And it's like I've always said, I know nothing about

02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:44.960
chemistry. I learned all the chemistry I know the night before some exam when I was 14 years old.

02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:48.960
But I've actually learned a bunch more chemistry. And in Wolfram language these days,

02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:53.760
we have really pretty nice symbolic representation of chemistry. And in understanding the design of

02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:57.360
that, I've actually, I think, learned a certain amount of chemistry. Though if you quizzed me

02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:03.600
on sort of basic high school chemistry, I would probably totally fail. But okay. So what is

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:09.920
chemistry? I mean, chemistry is sort of a story of chemical reactions are like you've got this

02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:15.600
particular chemical, it's represented as some graph of these are this configuration of molecules

02:39:15.600 --> 02:39:21.440
with these bonds and so on. And a chemical reaction happens, you've got these sort of two graphs,

02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:25.040
they interact in some way, you've got another graph or multiple other graphs out. So that's

02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:31.840
kind of the sort of the abstract view of what's happening in chemistry. And so when you do a

02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:36.800
chemical synthesis, for example, you are given certain sort of these are possible reactions

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:41.920
that can happen. And you're asked, can you piece together this a sequence of such reactions,

02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:46.400
a sequence of such sort of axiomatic reactions, usually called name reactions in chemistry,

02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:51.440
can you piece together a sequence of these reactions, so that you get out at the end,

02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:55.520
this great molecule we were trying to synthesize. And so that's a story very much like theorem

02:39:55.520 --> 02:40:01.200
proving. And people have done, actually, they started in the 1960s looking at, at kind of the

02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:05.600
theorem proving approach to that, although it didn't really, it didn't, it didn't sort of done

02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:10.800
too early, I think. But anyway, so that's kind of the view is that that chemistry chemical reactions

02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:17.040
are the story of all these different sort of paths of possible things that go on. Okay, let's go to

02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:23.840
an even lower level. Let's say, instead of asking about which species of molecules we're talking

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:28.400
about, let's look at individual molecules. And let's say we're looking at individual molecules,

02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:32.320
and they are having chemical reactions. And we're building up this big graph of all these

02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:38.080
reactions that are happening. Okay, so then we've got this big graph. And by the way, that big graph

02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:44.720
is incredibly similar to this hypergraph rewriting things. In fact, in the underlying theory of

02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:49.280
multi computation, there are these things we call token event graphs, which are basically,

02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:53.920
you've broken your state into tokens. Like in the case of a hypergraph, you've broken it into

02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:59.280
hyper edges. And each event is just consuming some number of tokens and producing some number

02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:03.280
of tokens. But then you have to there's a lot of work to be done on the update rules.

02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:09.680
In terms of what they actually offer chemistry? Yeah, what they offer are observed chemistry.

02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:13.760
Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. We've been working on that, actually, because we have this beautiful

02:41:13.760 --> 02:41:18.160
system in Wolfram language for representing chemistry symbolically. So we actually have,

02:41:18.160 --> 02:41:21.600
you know, this is a this is an ongoing thing to actually figure out what they are for some

02:41:21.600 --> 02:41:26.480
practical cases. Does that require human injection? Or can it be automatically discovered?

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:30.560
These update rules? Well, if we could do quantum chemistry better, we could probably

02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:35.200
discover them automatically. But I think in reality, right now, it's like there are these

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:39.360
particular reactions. And really, to understand what's going on, we're probably going to pick a

02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:44.080
particular subtype of chemistry. And just because because let me explain where this is going,

02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:49.920
that the place that here's here's where this is going. So got this whole network of all

02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:55.280
these molecules, having all these reactions and so on. And this is some whole multi computational

02:41:55.280 --> 02:42:02.160
story, because each each sort of chemical reaction event is its own separate event.

02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:06.400
We're saying they all happen asynchronously. We're not describing in what order they happen.

02:42:06.400 --> 02:42:10.560
You know, maybe that order is governed by some quantum mechanics thing doesn't really matter.

02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:16.000
We're just saying they happen in some order. And then we ask, what is the what's the you know,

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:21.440
how do we think about the system? Well, this thing is some kind of big multi computational system.

02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:26.240
The question is, what is the chemical observer? And one possible chemical observer is,

02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:30.160
all you care about is, did you make that particular drug molecule? You're just asking,

02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:34.240
you know, the for the one path. Another thing you might care about is, I want to know the

02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:39.920
concentration of each species. I want to know, you know, at every stage, I'm going to solve the

02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:43.280
differential equations that represent the concentrations. And I want to know what those

02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:49.200
all are. But there's more. Because when it's kind of like, you're going below in statistical

02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:55.280
mechanics, there's kind of all these molecules bouncing around. And you might say, we're just

02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:00.000
going to ignore we're just going to look at the aggregate densities of certain kinds of molecules,

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.800
but you can look at a lower level, you can look at this whole graph of possible interactions.

02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:10.000
And so the kind of the idea would be, what, you know, is the only chemical observer,

02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:15.680
one who just cares about overall concentrations, or can there be a chemical observer who cares

02:43:15.680 --> 02:43:22.080
about this network of what happened? And so that the question then is, so let me give an analogy.

02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:26.160
So this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular molecular biology and

02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:31.680
molecular computing. When we think about a computation, usually, we say it's input,

02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:36.000
it's output, we, you know, or chemistry, we say there's this input, we're going to make this

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:42.400
molecule as the output. But what if what we actually encode, what if our computation,

02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:45.840
what if the thing we care about is some part of this dynamic network?

02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:50.560
What if it isn't just the input and the output that we care about? What if there's some dynamics

02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:55.120
of the network that we care about? Now, imagine you're a chemical observer. What is a chemical

02:43:55.120 --> 02:44:00.720
observer? Well, in molecular biology, there are all kinds of weird sorts of observers,

02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:05.200
there are membranes that exist that have, you know, different kinds of molecules that combine

02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:10.880
to them, things like this, it's not obvious that the from a human scale, we just measure the

02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:15.760
concentration of something is the relevant story. We can imagine that, for example,

02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:20.080
when we look at this whole network of possible reactions, we can imagine, you know, at a physical

02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:25.040
level, we can imagine, well, what was the actual momentum direction of that molecule? What was it

02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:29.040
which we don't pay any attention to when we're just talking about chemical concentrations? What

02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:34.640
was the orientation of that molecule? These kinds of things. And so here's the place where I'm,

02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:40.480
I have a little suspicion, okay? So one of the questions in biology is what matters in biology,

02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:45.200
and that is, you know, we have all these chemical reactions, we have all these molecular processes

02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:51.760
going on in, you know, in biological systems, what matters? And, you know, one of the things is

02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:56.560
to be able to tell what matters. Well, so a big story of the what matters question was what

02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:02.240
happened in genetics in 1953, when DNA, when it was figured out how DNA worked. Because before

02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:06.160
that time, you know, genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things.

02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:11.280
And then it was realized, ah, there's something new, a molecule can store information, which

02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:16.000
wasn't obvious before that time, a single molecule can store information. So there's a place

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:20.560
where there can be something important that's happening in molecular biology. And it's just

02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:25.600
in the sequence that storing information in a molecule. So the possibility now is,

02:45:25.600 --> 02:45:31.120
imagine this dynamic network, this, you know, causal graphs, and multi-way causal graphs,

02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:35.120
and so on, that represent all of these different reactions between molecules,

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:39.520
what if there is some aspect of that, that is storing information that's relevant for

02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:45.520
molecular biology? In the dynamic aspect of that? Yes, that's right. So it's similar to how the

02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:51.440
structure of a DNA molecule stores information, it could be the dynamics of the system somehow

02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:57.680
stores information. And this kind of process might allow you to give predictions of what that

02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:03.760
would be. Well, yes, but also imagine that you're trying to do, for example, imagine you're trying

02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:08.240
to do molecular computation, okay? You might think the way we're going to do molecular

02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:11.600
computation is we're just going to run the thing, we're going to see what came out, we're going to

02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:16.960
see what molecule came out. This is saying that's not the only thing you can do. There is a different

02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:22.240
kind of chemical observer that you can imagine constructing, which is somehow sensitive to this

02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:27.120
dynamic network. Exactly how that works, how we make that measurement, I don't know, but I have

02:46:27.120 --> 02:46:33.040
few ideas, but that's what's important, so to speak. And that means, and by the way, you can

02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:38.080
do the same thing even for Turing machines. You can say, if you have a multi-way Turing machine,

02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:42.400
you can say, how do you compute with a multi-way Turing machine? You can't say,

02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:46.480
well, we've got this input and this output, because the thing has all these threads of time,

02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:50.960
it's got lots of outputs. And so then you say, well, what does it even mean to be a universal

02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:55.520
multi-way Turing machine? I don't fully know the answer to that. But it has an interesting idea,

02:46:55.520 --> 02:47:02.000
it would freak Turing out for sure, because then the dynamics of the trajectory of the computation

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:09.360
matters. Yes, yes. But the thing is that this is again a story of what's the observer, so to speak,

02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:14.560
in chemistry, what's the observer there? Now, to give an example of where that might matter,

02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:23.520
a very present day example is in immunology, where we have whatever it is, 10 billion different

02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:29.200
kinds of antibodies that are all these different shapes and so on. We have a trillion different

02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:36.800
kinds of T cell receptors that we produce. The traditional theory of immunology is this

02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:42.400
clonal selection theory, where we are constantly randomly producing all these different antibodies,

02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:46.880
and as soon as one of them binds to an antigen, then that one gets amplified and we produce more

02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:53.920
of that antibody and so on. Back in the 1960s, an immunologist called Niels Jöhne, who was the guy

02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:59.760
who invented molecular antibodies, various other things, had this network theory of the immune

02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:04.400
system, where it would be like, well, we produce antibodies, but then we produce antibodies to the

02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:08.640
antibodies, anti-antibodies, and we produce anti-anti-antibodies, and we get this whole

02:48:08.640 --> 02:48:16.400
dynamic network of interactions between different immune system cells. That was a qualitative

02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:21.520
theory at that time. I've been a little disappointed because I've been studying immunology a bit

02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:26.640
recently, and I knew something about this like 35 years ago or something, and I knew I'd read a

02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:31.360
bunch of the books and I'd talked to a bunch of the people and so on, and it was like an emerging

02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:37.520
theoretical immunology world. Then I look at the books now, and they're very thick because there's

02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:42.720
just a ton known about immunology, and all these different pathways, all these different details,

02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:49.920
and so on, but the theoretical sections seem to have shrunk. The question is,

02:48:50.640 --> 02:48:55.920
what, for example, immune memory, where does the immune memory reside? Is it actually some

02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:00.480
cell sitting in our bone marrow that is living for the whole of our lives that's going to spring

02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:05.440
into action as soon as we're shown the same antigen, or is it something different from that?

02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:09.840
Is it something more dynamic? Is it something more like some network of interactions between

02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:14.400
these different kinds of immune system cells and so on? Then it's known that there are plenty of

02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:19.840
interactions between T cells and there's plenty of dynamics, but what the consequence of that

02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:26.560
dynamics is is not clear, and to have a qualitative theory for that doesn't seem to exist. In fact,

02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:30.640
I was just been trying to study this, so I'm quite incomplete in my study of these things,

02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.360
but I was a little bit taken aback because I've been looking at these things, and then they get

02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:38.880
to the end where they have the most advanced theory that they've got, and it turns out it's

02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:44.480
a cellular automaton theory. It's like, okay, well, at least I understand that theory.

02:49:46.480 --> 02:49:54.480
I think that the possibility is that this is a place where if you want to explain roughly how

02:49:54.480 --> 02:50:01.600
the immune system works, it ends up being this dynamic network, and then the immune consciousness,

02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:07.200
so to speak, the observer ends up being something that in the end, it's kind of like, does the human

02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:13.520
get sick or whatever, but it's something which is a complicated story that relates to this whole

02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:19.040
dynamic network and so on, and I think that's another place where this notion of where I think

02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:24.080
multi-computation has the possibility. See, one of the things, okay, you can end up with something

02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:29.280
where, yes, there is a general relativity in there, but it may turn out that the observer

02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:35.120
who sees general relativity in the immune system is an observer that's irrelevant to what we care

02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:39.920
about about the immune system. I mean, it could be, yes, there is some effect where there's some

02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:46.640
time dilation of T cells interacting with whatever, but that's an effect that's just irrelevant,

02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:51.920
and the thing we actually care about is things about what happens when you have a vaccine that

02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:56.400
goes into some place in shape space, and how does that affect other places in shape space,

02:50:56.400 --> 02:51:01.440
and how does that spread? What's the analog of the speed of light in shape space, for example?

02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:06.880
That's an important issue. If you have one of these dynamic theories, it's like you poke into

02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:12.080
shape space by having, let's say, a vaccine or something that has a particular configuration in

02:51:12.080 --> 02:51:20.240
shape space. How quickly, as this dynamic network spreads out, how quickly do you get other antibodies

02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:22.160
in different places in shape space? Things like that.

02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:24.400
When you say shape space, you mean the shape of the molecules?

02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:25.120
Yes.

02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:30.640
And then, so this could be deeply connected to the protein and multi-protein folding,

02:51:30.640 --> 02:51:36.080
all of that kind of stuff, so to be able to say something interesting about the dance of proteins

02:51:36.080 --> 02:51:44.240
that then actually has an impact on helping develop drugs, for example, or has an impact on

02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:46.880
virology, immunology of helping to develop viruses.

02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:51.760
Well, I think the big thing is, when we think about molecular biology,

02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:59.520
what is the qualitative way to think about it? In other words, is it chemical reaction networks?

02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:09.680
Is it genetics, DNA, big news? There's a digital aspect to the whole thing. What is the qualitative

02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:15.600
way to think about how things work in biology? When we think about some phenomenon like aging

02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:18.720
or something, which is a big complicated phenomenon, which just seems to have all

02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:24.160
these different tentacles, is it really the case that that can be thought about in some... Without

02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:30.160
DNA, when people were describing genetic phenomena, there were dominant, recessive,

02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:33.920
this, that, and the other, it got very, very complicated, and then people realized, oh,

02:52:33.920 --> 02:52:38.720
it's just... And what is a gene and so on and so on and so on, then people realized it's just

02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:43.360
base pairs, and there's this digital representation. And so the question is, what is the overarching

02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:47.680
representation that we can now start to think about using in microbiology? I don't know how

02:52:47.680 --> 02:52:52.400
this will work out, and this is, again, one of these things where... And the place where that

02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:58.880
gets important is, maybe molecular biology is doing molecular computing by using some

02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:04.560
dynamic process that is something where it is very happily saying, oh, I just got a result.

02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:08.240
It's in the dynamic structure of this network. Now I'm going to go and do some other thing

02:53:08.240 --> 02:53:13.360
based on that result, for example. But we're like, oh, I don't know what's going on. We just

02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:18.480
measured the levels of these chemicals and we couldn't conclude anything, but we're looking at

02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:25.840
the wrong thing. And so that's kind of the potential there. I mean, these things are...

02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:31.600
I don't know. For me, it's like I've not really... That was not a view. I mean,

02:53:31.600 --> 02:53:35.840
I've thought about molecular computing for ages and ages and ages, and I've always imagined

02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:41.440
that the big story is kind of the original promise of nanotechnology of like, can we make

02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:47.360
a molecular-scale constructor that will just build a molecule in any shape? But I'm now

02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:52.160
increasingly concluding that's not the big point. The big point is something more dynamic.

02:53:52.160 --> 02:53:57.760
That will be an interesting endpoint for any of these things, but that's perhaps not the thing...

02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:02.160
Because the one example we have in molecular computing that's really working is us biological

02:54:02.160 --> 02:54:09.200
organisms. And maybe the thing that's important there is not this, what chemicals do you make,

02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:11.680
so to speak, but more this kind of dynamic process.

02:54:11.840 --> 02:54:15.920
Dynamic process, and then you can have a good model like the hypograph to then explore,

02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:21.040
what, like simulate, again, make predictions, and if they...

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:27.440
I think just have a way to reason about biology. I mean, it's hard. First of all, biology doesn't

02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:33.760
have theories like physics. Physics is a much more successful sort of global theory kind of area.

02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:39.440
Biology, what are the global theories of biology? Pretty much Darwinian evolution. That's the only

02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:44.800
global theory of biology. Any other theory is just a, well, the kidneys work this way,

02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:50.160
this thing works this way, and so on. I suppose another global theory is digital information

02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:53.040
in DNA. That's another sort of global fact about biology.

02:54:53.040 --> 02:55:00.400
But the difficult thing to do is to match something you have a model of in the hypograph

02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:05.360
to the actual... How do you discover the theory? How do you discover the theory? Okay, you have

02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:11.200
something that looks nice and makes sense, but you have to match it to validation and experiment,

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:14.320
and that's tricky because you're walking around in the dark.

02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:21.360
Not entirely. For example, in what we've been trying to think about is take actual chemical

02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:29.840
reactions. One of my goals is, can I compute the primes with molecules? If I can do that,

02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:36.480
maybe I can compute things. There's this nice automated lab, these guys, this Emerald Cloud

02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:40.640
lab people have built with Wolfram Language and so on. That's an actual physical lab,

02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:45.280
and you send it a piece of Wolfram Language code, and it goes and actually does physical

02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:50.880
experiments. One of my goals, because I'm not a test tube kind of guy, I'm more of a software

02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:57.040
kind of person, is can I make something where in this automated lab, we can actually get it so that

02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:00.640
there's some gel that we made, and the positions of the stripes are the primes.

02:56:00.640 --> 02:56:02.160
These are the primes. I love it, yeah.

02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:10.240
That would be an example of where... And that would be with a particular framework for actually

02:56:10.240 --> 02:56:15.360
doing the molecular computing with particular kinds of molecules, and there's a lot of kind of

02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:20.640
ambient technological mess, so to speak, associated with, oh, is it carbon? Is it this? Is it that?

02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:25.200
Is it important that there's a bromine atom here? Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is all

02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:31.920
chemistry that I don't know much about. Unfortunately, that's down at the level...

02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:37.040
I would like to be at the software level, not at the level of the transistors, so to speak,

02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:41.520
but in chemistry, there's a certain amount we have to do, I think, at the level of transistors

02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:47.360
before we get up to being able to do it, although the automated labs certainly help in setting that

02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:55.040
up. I talked to a guy named Charles Hoskinson. He mentioned that he's collaborating with you,

02:56:55.600 --> 02:57:01.280
he's an interesting guy. He sends me papers on speaking of automated theorem proving a lot.

02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:06.240
He's exceptionally well-read on that area as well. So what's the nature of your collaboration

02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:12.160
with him? He's the creator of Cardano. What's the nature of the collaboration between Cardano

02:57:12.160 --> 02:57:16.320
and the whole space of blockchain and Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram blockchain, all that kind

02:57:16.320 --> 02:57:24.320
of stuff? Well, okay, we're segueing to a slightly different world, but so although not completely

02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:30.880
unconnected. Right. The whole thing is somehow connected. I know. The strange thing in my life

02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:35.680
is I've sort of alternated between doing basic science and doing technology about five times in

02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:42.160
my life so far. The thing that's just crazy about it is every time I do one of these alternations,

02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:46.880
I think there's not going to be a way back to the other thing. I thought for this physics project,

02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:51.360
I thought we're doing fundamental theory of physics, maybe it'll have an application in

02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:58.960
200 years, but now I've realized actually this multi-computation idea is applicable here and now.

02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:04.880
In fact, it's also giving us this way. I'll just mention one other thing and then talk about

02:58:04.880 --> 02:58:13.920
blockchain. Actually, that relates to several different things, but one of the things about,

02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:20.800
okay, so our Wolfram language, which is our attempt to kind of represent everything in the

02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:25.840
world computationally. It's the thing I kind of started building 40 years ago in the form of

02:58:25.840 --> 02:58:34.240
actual Wolfram language 35 years ago. It's kind of this idea of can we express things about the

02:58:34.240 --> 02:58:40.480
world in computational terms? We've come a long way in being able to do that. Wolfram alpha is

02:58:40.480 --> 02:58:45.440
kind of the consumer version of that where you're just using natural language as input, and it turns

02:58:45.440 --> 02:58:51.520
it into our symbolic language. The symbolic language, Wolfram language, is what people use

02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:56.240
and have been using for the last 33 years. Actually, Mathematica, which is its first

02:58:56.240 --> 02:59:05.920
instantiation, will be one-third of a century old in October. It's kind of interesting.

02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:09.280
What do you mean one-third of a century? Does that mean 33 or 30? What do we-

02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:10.720
33 and a third.

02:59:10.720 --> 02:59:17.680
33 and a third. I've never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary, but I like it.

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:22.800
I know. A third of a century, though. You don't get many slices of a century that are interesting.

02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:27.280
I think that the thing that's really striking about that is that means,

02:59:28.240 --> 02:59:31.920
including the whole sort of technology stack I built around that's about 40 years old,

02:59:31.920 --> 02:59:35.360
and that means it's a significant fraction of the total age of the computer industry.

02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:42.560
And I think it's cool that we can still run Mathematica version 1 programs today and so on,

02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:47.200
and we've sort of maintained compatibility. And we've been just building this big tower

02:59:47.200 --> 02:59:51.280
all those years of just more and more and more computational capabilities. It's sort of

02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:58.080
interesting. We just made this picture of kind of the different kind of threads of computational

02:59:58.080 --> 03:00:06.400
content, of mathematical content and all sorts of things with data and graphs and whatever else.

03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:10.640
And what you see in this picture is about the first 10 years, it's kind of like it's just a

03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:17.040
few threads. And then about maybe 15, 20 years ago, it kind of explodes in this whole collection,

03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:21.040
different threads of all these different capabilities that are now part of Wolfram

03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:26.320
Language and representing different things in the world. But the thing that was super lucky

03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:31.840
in some sense is it's all based on one idea. It's all based on the idea of symbolic expressions

03:00:31.840 --> 03:00:36.240
and transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which was kind of what I originally

03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:42.880
put into this SMP system back in 1979 that was a predecessor of the whole Wolfram Language stack.

03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:48.880
So that idea was an idea that I got from sort of trying to understand mathematical logic and so on.

03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:54.880
It was my attempt to kind of make a general human comprehensible model of computation,

03:00:54.880 --> 03:00:59.360
of just everything is a symbolic expression and all you do is transform symbolic expressions.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:06.880
And in retrospect, I was very lucky that I understood as little as I understood then,

03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:11.520
because had I understood more, I would have been completely freaked out about all the different

03:01:11.520 --> 03:01:18.080
ways that that kind of model can fail. Because what do you do when you have a symbolic expression,

03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:22.720
you make transformations for symbolic expressions? Well, for example, one question is there may be

03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:27.360
many transformations that could be made in a very multi-computational kind of way. But what

03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:32.480
we're doing is picking, we're using the first transformation that applies. And we keep doing

03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:39.520
that until we reach a fixed point and that's the result. And that's kind of a way of sort of

03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:44.480
sliding around the edge of multi-computation. Back when I was working on SMP and things,

03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:52.000
I actually thought about these questions about what determines this kind of evaluation path.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.720
So for example, you work out Fibonacci. Fibonacci is a recursive thing, F of n is

03:01:56.720 --> 03:02:00.720
F of n minus one plus F of n minus two, and you get this whole tree of recursion.

03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:05.440
And there's the question of how do you evaluate that tree of recursion? Do you do it

03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:09.440
sort of depth first, where you go all the way down one side? Do you do it breadth first,

03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:14.160
where you're kind of collecting the terms together, where you know that F of eight plus F of seven,

03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:20.160
F of seven plus F of six, you can collect the F of sevens and so on. These are, I didn't realize

03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:25.120
it at the time, it's kind of funny. I was working on gauge field theories back in 1979,

03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:31.280
and I was also working on the evaluation model in SMP, and they're the same problem. But it took me

03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:37.120
40 more years to realize that. And this question about how you do this sort of evaluation front,

03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:42.640
that's a question of reference frames. It's a question of kind of the story of, I mean,

03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:47.680
that is basically this question of in what order is the universe evaluated?

03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:53.520
And so what you realize is there's this whole sort of world of different kinds of computation

03:02:53.520 --> 03:02:58.400
that you can do sort of multi-computationally, and that's an interesting thing. It has a lot

03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:02.640
of implications for distributed computing and so on. It also has a potential implication for

03:03:02.640 --> 03:03:07.360
blockchain, which we haven't fully worked out, which is, and this is not what we're doing with

03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:14.880
Cardano, but this is a different thing. This is something where one of the questions is,

03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:21.280
when you have, in a sense, blockchain is a deeply sequentialized story of time,

03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:26.000
because in blockchain, there's just one copy of the ledger, and you're saying,

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:31.040
this is what happened. Time has progressed in this way. And there are little things around the edge

03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:37.440
as you try and reach consensus and so on. And actually, just recently, we've had this little

03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:41.440
conference we organized about the theory of distributed consensus, because I realized that

03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:45.200
there are a bunch of interesting things that some of our science can tell one about that,

03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:47.680
but that's a different, let's not go down that path.

03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:50.560
Yeah, but distributed consensus, that still has a sequential.

03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:52.240
There's still sequentiality.

03:03:53.040 --> 03:03:58.960
Don't tell me you're thinking through how to apply multi-computation to blockchain.

03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:06.560
Yes. And so that becomes a story of, instead of transactions all having to settle in one ledger,

03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:10.960
it's like a story of all these different ledgers, and they all have to have some ultimate

03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:15.840
consistency, which is what causal invariance would give one. But it can take a while,

03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:20.960
and the it can take a while is like quantum mechanics. So what's happening is there are

03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:26.720
these different paths of history that correspond to, in one path of history, you got paid this

03:04:26.720 --> 03:04:31.520
amount. In another path of history, you got paid this amount. In the end, the universe will always

03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:37.520
become consistent. Now, the way it works is, okay, it's a little bit more complicated than that.

03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:42.160
What happens is, the way space is knitted together in our theory of physics is through

03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:48.960
all these events. And the idea is that the way that economic space is knitted together

03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:54.800
is that these autonomous events that essentially knit together economic space.

03:04:54.800 --> 03:04:58.240
So there are all these threads of transactions that are happening. And the question is,

03:04:58.240 --> 03:05:03.280
can they be made consistent? Is there something forcing them to be sort of a consistent

03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:09.840
fabric of economic reality? And what this has led me to is trying to realize how does economics

03:05:09.840 --> 03:05:17.680
fundamentally work? And what is economics? And what are the atoms of economics, so to speak?

03:05:17.680 --> 03:05:24.320
And so what I've realized is that perhaps, I don't even know if this is right yet,

03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:30.320
there's events in economics that are transactions. There are states of agents that are the atoms of

03:05:30.320 --> 03:05:38.000
economics. And then transactions are kind of agents transact in some way, and that's an event.

03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:43.360
And then the question is, how do you knit together sort of economic space from that?

03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:47.360
What is there in economic space? Well, all these transactions, there's a whole complicated

03:05:47.360 --> 03:05:52.080
collection of possible transactions. But one thing that's true about economics is we tend to have

03:05:52.080 --> 03:06:01.600
the notion of a definite value for things. We could imagine that you buy a cookie from somebody

03:06:01.600 --> 03:06:09.040
and they want to get a movie ticket. And there is some way that AI bots could make some path

03:06:09.680 --> 03:06:14.640
from the cookie to the movie ticket by all these different intermediate transactions.

03:06:15.200 --> 03:06:21.440
But in fact, we have an approximation to that, which is we say they each have a dollar value,

03:06:21.440 --> 03:06:27.760
and we have this kind of numeraire concept of there's just a way of kind of taking this whole

03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:33.840
complicated space of transactions and parsing it in something which is a kind of a simplified

03:06:33.840 --> 03:06:41.280
thing that is kind of like a parsing of physical space. And so my guess is that yet again, I mean,

03:06:41.280 --> 03:06:46.480
it's crazy that all these things are so connected. This is another multi-computation story,

03:06:46.480 --> 03:06:51.040
another story of where what's happening is that the economic consciousness,

03:06:51.040 --> 03:06:56.560
the economic observer is not going to deal with all of those different microscopic transactions.

03:06:56.560 --> 03:07:00.800
They're just going to parse the whole thing by saying there's this value, it's a number.

03:07:00.800 --> 03:07:06.000
And that's their understanding of their summary of this economic network. And there will be all

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:09.680
kinds of things like there are all kinds of arbitrage opportunities, which are kind of like

03:07:09.680 --> 03:07:16.240
the quantum effects and this whole thing. And that's in places where there's sort of different

03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:23.360
paths that can be followed and so on. So the question is, can one make a sort of global

03:07:23.360 --> 03:07:28.880
theory of economics? And then my test case is, again, what is time dilation in economics?

03:07:29.520 --> 03:07:35.120
And I know if you imagine a very agricultural economics where people are growing lettuces in

03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:39.680
fields and things like this, and you ask questions about, well, if you're transporting lettuces to

03:07:39.680 --> 03:07:45.520
different places, what is the value of the lettuces after you have to transport them versus if you're

03:07:45.520 --> 03:07:49.120
just sitting in one place and selling them? And you can kind of get a little bit of an analogy

03:07:49.120 --> 03:07:53.520
there. But I think there's a better and more complete analogy. And that's the question of,

03:07:53.520 --> 03:07:58.560
is there a theory like general relativity that is a global theory of economics? And is it about

03:07:58.560 --> 03:08:02.640
something we care about? It could be that there is a global theory, but it's about a feature of

03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:08.720
economic reality that isn't important to us. Now, another part of the story is, can one use those

03:08:08.720 --> 03:08:14.640
ideas to make essentially a distributed blockchain, a distributed generalization of blockchain,

03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:19.280
kind of the quantum analog of money, so to speak, where you have, for example,

03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:24.640
you can have uncertainty relations where you're saying, well, if I insist on knowing my bank

03:08:24.640 --> 03:08:30.240
account right now, there'll be some uncertainty. If I'm prepared to wait a while, then it'll be

03:08:30.240 --> 03:08:36.720
much more certain. And so is there a way of using... And so we've made a bunch of prototypes of this,

03:08:37.680 --> 03:08:42.000
which I'm not yet happy with, because what I realized is, to really understand these

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:45.120
prototypes, they actually have to have a foundational theory of economics.

03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:50.320
And so that's kind of a... It may be that we could deploy one of these prototypes as a practical

03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:54.400
system, but I think it's really going to be much better if we actually have an understanding of

03:08:54.400 --> 03:08:58.560
how this plugs into kind of the economic system. And that means like a fundamental theory of

03:08:58.560 --> 03:09:03.760
transactions between entities. That's what you mean by economics.

03:09:03.760 --> 03:09:09.120
Yes, I think so. But I mean, how there emerge sort of laws of economics. I don't even know,

03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:13.760
and I've been asking friends of mine who are economists and things, what is economics?

03:09:14.400 --> 03:09:20.400
Is it an axiomatic theory? Is it a theory that is kind of a qualitative description theory?

03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:24.880
Is it... What kind of a theory is it? Is it a theory... What kind of thinking? It's like

03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:30.560
in biology, in evolutionary biology, for example, there's a certain pattern of thinking that goes

03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:35.760
on in evolutionary biology, where if you're a good evolutionary biologist, somebody says,

03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:40.320
that creature has a weird horn. And they'll say, well, that's because this and this and this,

03:09:40.320 --> 03:09:45.040
and there's selection of this kind and that kind, and that's the story. And it's not a

03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:49.680
mathematical story. It's a story of a different type of thinking about these things. By the way,

03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:55.360
evolutionary biology is yet another place where it looks like this multi-computational idea can be

03:09:55.360 --> 03:10:01.280
applied. And that's where maybe speciation is related to things like event horizons,

03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:04.000
and there's a whole other kind of world of that.

03:10:04.640 --> 03:10:11.120
It seems like this kind of model can be applicable in so many aspects, like the different levels

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:17.600
of understanding of our reality. So it could be the biology, the chemistry, at the physics level,

03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:25.360
the economics, and you could potentially... The thing is, it's like, okay, sure, at all these

03:10:25.360 --> 03:10:29.920
levels it might rhyme. It might make sense as a model. The question is, can you make useful

03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:34.240
predictions at one of these levels? That's right. And that's really a question of...

03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:41.600
It's a weird situation because it's a situation where the model probably has definite consequences.

03:10:41.600 --> 03:10:49.840
The question is, are they consequences we care about? And so in the economic case,

03:10:50.240 --> 03:11:01.360
the one thing is this idea of using kind of physics-like notions to construct a kind of

03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:07.040
distributed analog of blockchain. Okay. The much more pragmatic thing is a different direction,

03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:11.040
and it has to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world

03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:16.560
that knows about different kinds of cookies and knows about different cities and knows about

03:11:16.640 --> 03:11:21.120
how to compute all these kinds of things. One of the things that is of interest is,

03:11:21.120 --> 03:11:28.160
if you want to run the world with contracts and laws and rules and so on, there are rules

03:11:28.160 --> 03:11:34.000
at a human level and there are kind of things like... And so this gets one into the idea of

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:39.120
computational contracts. Right now, when we write a contract, it's a piece of legalese.

03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:44.400
It's just written in English, and it's not something that's automatically analyzable,

03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:53.280
executable, whatever else. It's just English. Gottfried Leibniz back in 1680 or whatever

03:11:53.280 --> 03:12:01.120
was going to figure out how to use logic to decide legal cases and so on, and he had this idea of,

03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:07.280
let's make a computational language for the human law, forget about modeling nature,

03:12:07.280 --> 03:12:12.960
forgot about natural laws. What about human law? Can we make a computational representation of that?

03:12:12.960 --> 03:12:17.680
Well, I think finally we're close to being able to do that. And one of the projects that I hope

03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:23.040
to get to, as soon as there's a little bit of slowing down of some of this Cambrian explosion

03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:27.280
that's happening is a project I've been meaning to really do for a long time, which is what I'm

03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:32.400
calling a symbolic discourse language. It's just finishing the job of being able to represent

03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:38.400
everything like the conversation we're having in computational terms. And one of the use cases for

03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:43.760
that is computational contracts. Another use case is something like the constitution that says what

03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:49.360
the AIs, what we want the AIs to do. But this is useful. So you're saying, so these are like,

03:12:49.360 --> 03:12:53.760
you're saying computational contracts, but smart contracts. This is what's in the domain of

03:12:53.760 --> 03:12:58.800
cryptocurrency is known as smart contracts. And so the language you've developed, this symbolic

03:12:59.440 --> 03:13:04.320
or seek to further develop symbolic discourse language enables you to-

03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:06.320
Write a contract.

03:13:06.320 --> 03:13:11.680
And write a contract that richly represents some aspect of the world.

03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:17.120
Yeah. But so, I mean, smart contracts tend to be right now mostly about things happening on the

03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:22.320
blockchain. Sometimes they have oracles. And in fact, our Wolfram Alpha API is the main thing

03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:27.360
people use to get information about the real world, so to speak, within smart contracts.

03:13:27.360 --> 03:13:32.960
So Wolfram Alpha, as it stands, is a really good oracle for whoever wants to use it. That's perhaps

03:13:32.960 --> 03:13:34.560
where the relationship with Cardano is.

03:13:34.560 --> 03:13:38.400
Yeah. Well, that's how we started getting involved with blockchains is we realized people were using

03:13:38.960 --> 03:13:44.160
Wolfram Alpha as the oracle for smart contracts, so to speak. And so that got us interested in

03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:49.600
blockchains in general. And what was ended up happening is Wolfram language is, with its

03:13:49.600 --> 03:13:54.800
symbolic representation of things, is really very good at representing things like blockchains.

03:13:54.800 --> 03:13:59.120
And so I think we now have, and we don't really know all the comparisons, but we now have a really

03:13:59.120 --> 03:14:04.960
nice environment within Wolfram language for dealing with the sort of, you know, for representing

03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:09.440
what happens in blockchains, for analyzing what happens in blockchains. We have a whole effort

03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:16.160
in blockchain analytics. And, you know, we've sort of published some samples of how that works.

03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:20.400
But it's, you know, because our technology stack, Wolfram language and Mathematica,

03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:26.160
are very widely used in the quant finance world, there's a sort of immediate sort of

03:14:26.240 --> 03:14:32.720
co-evolution there of sort of the quant finance kind of thing and blockchain analytics.

03:14:32.720 --> 03:14:37.520
And so it's kind of the representation of blockchain in computational language.

03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:43.280
Then ultimately, it's kind of like, how do you run the world with code? That is, how do you write

03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:47.680
sort of all these things, which are right now regulations and laws and contracts and things

03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:53.440
in computational language? And kind of the ultimate vision is that sort of something happens in the

03:14:53.440 --> 03:14:57.920
world. And then there's this giant domino effect of all these computational contracts that trigger

03:14:57.920 --> 03:15:03.280
based on the thing that happened. And there's a whole story to that. And of course, you know,

03:15:03.280 --> 03:15:08.000
I like to always pay attention to the latest things that are going on. And I really, I kind

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:13.920
of like blockchain because it's another rethinking of kind of computation. It's kind of like, you

03:15:13.920 --> 03:15:19.600
know, cloud computing was a little bit of that of sort of persistent kind of computational

03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:24.400
resources and so on. And you know, this multi-computation is a big rethinking of

03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:28.880
kind of what it means to compute. Blockchain is another bit of rethinking of what it means

03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:34.000
to compute. The idea that you lodge kind of these autonomous lumps of computation out there in the

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:40.560
blockchain world. And one of the things that just sort of for fun, so to speak, as we've been doing

03:15:40.560 --> 03:15:45.600
a bit of stuff with NFTs and we just did some NFTs on Cardano and we'll be doing some more.

03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:52.400
And, you know, we did some cellular automaton NFTs on Cardano like quite a bit. And, you know,

03:15:52.400 --> 03:15:58.560
one of the things I've realized about NFTs is that there's kind of this notion and we're really

03:15:58.560 --> 03:16:04.240
working on this, you know, I like recording stuff. You know, one of the things that's come out of

03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:09.840
kind of my science, I suppose, is this history matters type story of, you know, it's not just

03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:14.560
the current state, it's the history that matters. And I've kind of, I don't think this is actually

03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:18.960
realizing, maybe it's not coincidental that I'm sort of the human who's recorded more about

03:16:18.960 --> 03:16:23.280
themselves than anybody else. And then I end up with these science results that say history

03:16:23.280 --> 03:16:27.760
matters, which was not those things. I didn't think those were connected, but-

03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:29.280
They're at least correlated, yes.

03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:33.920
Yeah, right. So, you know, this question about sort of recording what has happened

03:16:33.920 --> 03:16:38.960
and having sort of a permanent record of things. One of the things that's kind of interesting there

03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:42.160
is, you know, you put up a website and it's got a bunch of stuff on it, but, you know,

03:16:42.160 --> 03:16:46.240
you have to keep paying the hosting fees or the thing's going to go away. But one of the

03:16:46.240 --> 03:16:51.040
things about blockchain is kind of interesting is if you put something on a blockchain and you pay,

03:16:51.040 --> 03:16:56.800
you know, your commission to get that thing, you know, put on, you know, mine, put on the blockchain,

03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:02.720
then in a sense, everybody who comes after you is, you know, they are motivated to keep your

03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:06.960
thing alive because that's what keeps the consistency of the blockchain. So in a sense,

03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:11.760
with sort of the NFT world, it's kind of like, if you want to have something permanent, well,

03:17:11.760 --> 03:17:16.400
at least for the life of the blockchain, but even if the blockchain goes out of circulation,

03:17:16.400 --> 03:17:20.800
so to speak, there's going to be enough value in that whole collection of transactions that

03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:25.840
people are going to archive the thing. But that means that, you know, pay once and you're kind of

03:17:25.840 --> 03:17:30.640
you're lodged in the blockchain forever. And so we've been kind of playing around with a sort of

03:17:30.640 --> 03:17:38.960
a hobby thing of mine of thinking about sort of the NFTs and how you sort of the consumer idea

03:17:38.960 --> 03:17:43.760
of kind of the, it's the, it's the anti, you know, it's the opposite of the Snapchat

03:17:43.760 --> 03:17:50.160
view of the world. There's a permanence to it. That's heavily incentivized and thereby you can

03:17:50.160 --> 03:17:56.320
have a permanence of history. Right. And that's, that's, that's kind of the now, you know, so

03:17:56.320 --> 03:18:00.160
that's, so that's one of the things we've been doing with Cardano and it's kind of fun. I think

03:18:00.160 --> 03:18:04.640
that, that, I mean, this whole question about, you know, you mentioned automated theorem proving and

03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:08.800
blockchains and so on. And as I've thought about this kind of physics inspired distributed

03:18:08.800 --> 03:18:15.280
blockchain, obviously they're the sort of the proof that it works, that there are no double spends,

03:18:15.280 --> 03:18:21.200
there's no whatever else. That proof becomes a very formal kind of almost a matter of physics,

03:18:21.200 --> 03:18:26.160
so to speak. And, you know, it's been, it's been an interesting thing for the, for the practical

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:31.040
blockchains to do kind of actual automated theorem proving. And I don't think anybody's really

03:18:31.040 --> 03:18:35.600
managed it in an interesting case yet. It's a thing that people, you know, aspire to,

03:18:35.600 --> 03:18:39.840
but I think it's a challenging thing because basically the point is one of the, one of the

03:18:39.840 --> 03:18:44.800
things about proving correctness of something is, well, you know, people say, I've got this program

03:18:44.800 --> 03:18:48.560
and I'm going to prove it's correct. And it's like, what does that mean? You have to say what

03:18:48.560 --> 03:18:52.560
correct means. I mean, it's, it's kind of like, then you have to have another language. And

03:18:52.560 --> 03:18:56.640
people were very confused back in past decades of, you know, oh, we're going to prove the

03:18:56.640 --> 03:19:01.440
correctness by representing the program in another language, which we also don't know whether it's

03:19:01.440 --> 03:19:07.120
correct. And, you know, often by correctness, we just mean it can't crash or it can't scribble on

03:19:07.120 --> 03:19:12.160
memory. But, but the thing is that there's this complicated trade-off because as soon as there's,

03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:16.240
as soon as you're really using computation, you have computational irreducibility,

03:19:16.240 --> 03:19:22.240
you have undecidability. If you want to use computation seriously, you have to kind of let

03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:27.440
go of the idea that you're going to be able to box it in and say, we're going to have just this

03:19:27.440 --> 03:19:32.240
happen and not anything else. I mean, this is a, this is an old fact. I mean, Gödel's theorem

03:19:32.240 --> 03:19:37.680
tries to say, you know, piano arithmetic, the axioms of arithmetic, can you box in the integers

03:19:37.680 --> 03:19:42.000
and say, these axioms give just the integers and nothing about the integers. Gödel's theorem showed

03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:47.120
that wasn't the case. There's a, you know, you can have all these wild, weird things that are obey

03:19:47.120 --> 03:19:51.920
the piano axioms, but aren't integers. And there's this kind of infinite hierarchy of additional

03:19:51.920 --> 03:19:56.400
axioms you would have to add. And it's kind of the same thing. You, you don't get to, you know,

03:19:56.400 --> 03:20:01.040
if you want to say, I want to know what happens, you're boxing yourself in and there's a limit to

03:20:01.040 --> 03:20:05.120
what can happen, so to speak. So it's a, it's a complicated trade-off and it's a, it's a, it's a

03:20:05.120 --> 03:20:09.760
big trade-off for AI, so to speak. It's kind of like, do you want to let computation actually do

03:20:09.760 --> 03:20:14.480
what it can do? Or do you want to say, no, it's very, very boxed in to the point where we can

03:20:14.480 --> 03:20:19.600
understand every step. And that's a, that's kind of a thing that, that, that becomes difficult to

03:20:19.600 --> 03:20:24.880
do. But that, that's some, I mean, in, in general, I would say one of the things that's kind of

03:20:24.880 --> 03:20:30.480
complicated in my sort of life and the whole sort of story of computational language and,

03:20:30.480 --> 03:20:35.840
and all this technology and science and so on. I mean, I, I kind of in, in the flow of one's life,

03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:41.040
it's sort of interesting to see how these things play out because I, you know, I've kind of concluded

03:20:41.040 --> 03:20:46.320
that I'm in the business of making kind of artifacts from the future, which means, you know,

03:20:46.320 --> 03:20:49.840
there are things that I've done, I don't know, this physics project, I don't know whether anybody would

03:20:49.840 --> 03:20:55.120
have gotten to it for 50 years. You know, the fact that mathematics is a third of a century old,

03:20:55.120 --> 03:21:00.720
and I know that a bunch of the core ideas are not well absorbed. I mean, that is, people finally

03:21:00.720 --> 03:21:06.320
got this idea that I thought was a triviality of notebooks, that was 25 years. And, you know, some

03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:12.080
of these core ideas about symbolic computation and so on are not, are not absorbed. I mean, people,

03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:16.960
people use them every day in Wolfram language and, you know, do all kinds of cool things with them.

03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:21.600
But if you say, what is the fundamental intellectual point here? It's, it's not well

03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:25.840
absorbed. And it's, it's something where you kind of realize that you're, you're sort of building

03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:30.160
things. And I, I kind of made this, this thing about, you know, we're building artifacts from

03:21:30.160 --> 03:21:35.120
the future, so to speak. And I mentioned that it's our, we have a conference every, it's coming up

03:21:35.120 --> 03:21:40.000
actually in a couple of weeks, annual technology conference, where we talk about all the, all the

03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:45.200
things we're doing. And, you know, so I was talking about it last year, about, you know,

03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:49.440
we're making artifacts from the future. And I was kind of like, I had some, some version of that,

03:21:49.440 --> 03:21:54.240
that was kind of a dark and frustrated thing of like, you know, I'm building things, which nobody's

03:21:54.240 --> 03:21:59.840
going to care about until long after I'm dead, so to speak. But, but, but then I realized, you know,

03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:05.520
people were sort of telling me afterwards, you know, that's exactly how, you know, we're using

03:22:05.520 --> 03:22:09.920
Wolfram language in some particular setting and, you know, some computational X field or some

03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:15.120
organization or whatever. And it's like, people are saying, oh, you know, what did you manage to do?

03:22:15.120 --> 03:22:18.480
You know, well, we know that in principle, it will be possible to do that, but we didn't know that

03:22:18.480 --> 03:22:22.800
was possible now. And it's kind of like, that's the, that's sort of the business we're in. And

03:22:22.800 --> 03:22:27.440
in a sense with some of these ideas in science, you know, I feel a little bit the same way that

03:22:27.440 --> 03:22:33.200
there are some of these things where, you know, some things like, for example, this whole idea,

03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:38.320
well, so to relate to another sort of piece of history and the future, one of, you know, I

03:22:38.320 --> 03:22:42.880
mentioned, we mentioned at the beginning kind of complexity as this thing that I was interested in

03:22:42.880 --> 03:22:48.720
back 40 years ago and so on. Where does complexity come from? Well, I think we kind of nailed that.

03:22:48.720 --> 03:22:53.760
The answer is in the computational universe, even simple programs make it. And that's kind of the

03:22:53.760 --> 03:22:59.840
secret that nature has that allows you to make it. So that's kind of the, that's that part. But

03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:04.800
the bigger picture there was this idea of this kind of computational paradigm, the idea that you

03:23:04.800 --> 03:23:10.400
could go beyond mathematical equations, which had been sort of the primary modeling medium for 300

03:23:10.400 --> 03:23:16.640
years. And so it was like, look, it is inexorably the case that people will use programs rather than

03:23:16.640 --> 03:23:21.760
just equations. And, you know, I was saying that in the 1980s and people were, you know, I published

03:23:21.760 --> 03:23:28.000
my big book, New Kind of Science, that'll be 20 years ago next year. So in 2002 and people are

03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:32.320
saying, oh, no, this can't possibly be true. You know, we know for 300 years we've been doing all

03:23:32.320 --> 03:23:38.480
this stuff, right? To be fair, I now realize on a little bit more analysis of what people actually

03:23:38.480 --> 03:23:44.000
said in pretty much every field, other than physics, people said, oh, these are new models.

03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:48.640
That's pretty interesting. In physics, people were like, we've got our physics models. We're

03:23:48.640 --> 03:23:53.040
very happy with them. Yeah, in physics, there's more resistance because of the attachment and

03:23:53.040 --> 03:23:58.000
the power of the equations. The idea that programs might be the right way to approach

03:23:59.200 --> 03:24:05.040
this field. Was there some resistance? And like you're saying, it takes time. For somebody who

03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:09.120
likes the idea of time dilation and all these applications, I thought you would understand

03:24:09.120 --> 03:24:14.480
this. Yeah, right. But, you know, and computational irreducibility. Yes, exactly. But I mean,

03:24:14.480 --> 03:24:21.040
it is really interesting that just 20 years, the span of 20 years, it's gone from pitchforks

03:24:21.040 --> 03:24:30.720
and horror to, yeah, we get it. And it's helped that in our current effort in fundamental physics,

03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:35.680
we've gotten a lot further and we've managed to put a lot of puzzle pieces together that make

03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:40.160
sense. But the thing that I've been thinking about recently is this field of complexity. So I

03:24:41.040 --> 03:24:49.840
was a sort of a field builder back in the 1980s. I was kind of like, okay, can we... I'd understood

03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:53.360
this point that there was this sort of fundamental phenomenon of complexity and it showed up in lots

03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:59.600
of places. And I was like, this is an interesting sort of field of science. And I was recently

03:25:00.640 --> 03:25:06.080
was reminded, I was at the very first sort of get together of what became the Santa Fe

03:25:06.080 --> 03:25:10.640
Institute. And I was like, in fact, there's even an audio recording of me sort of saying,

03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:14.320
people have been talking about, oh, what should this outfit do? And I was saying,

03:25:14.320 --> 03:25:18.320
well, there is this thing that I've been thinking about. It's this kind of idea of complexity.

03:25:18.320 --> 03:25:22.480
Nice. And it's kind of like, and that's what that ended up...

03:25:22.480 --> 03:25:26.720
And you planted the seed of complexity at Santa Fe. That's beautiful. That's a beautiful vision.

03:25:26.720 --> 03:25:33.520
But I mean, so what's happened then is this idea of complexity. And I started the first

03:25:33.520 --> 03:25:37.120
research center at University of Illinois for doing that in the first journal,

03:25:37.120 --> 03:25:43.040
complex systems and so on. And it's kind of an interesting thing in my life, at least,

03:25:43.040 --> 03:25:48.400
that it's kind of like, you plant the seed, you have this idea. It's a kind of a science idea.

03:25:48.400 --> 03:25:52.960
You have this idea of sort of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity. The deeper idea was

03:25:52.960 --> 03:25:58.480
this computational paradigm. But the nominal idea is this kind of idea of complexity. Okay. Then you

03:25:58.480 --> 03:26:05.520
roll time forward 30 years or whatever, 35 years, whatever it is, and you say, what happened? Okay.

03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:10.080
Well, now there are a thousand complexity institutes around the world, I think, more or less.

03:26:10.080 --> 03:26:16.560
We've been trying to count them. And there are 40 complexity journals, I think. And so

03:26:17.600 --> 03:26:22.720
it's kind of like, what actually happened in this field? And I look at a lot of what happened,

03:26:22.720 --> 03:26:27.760
and I'm like, you know, I have to admit there's some eye rolling, so to speak,

03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:33.360
because it's kind of like, what's actually going on? Well, what people definitely got

03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:39.440
was this idea of computational models. And then they got, but they thought one of the kind of

03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:46.240
cognitive mistakes, I think, is they say, we've got a computational model, and we're looking

03:26:46.240 --> 03:26:52.240
at a system that's complex, and our computational model gives complexity. By golly, that must mean

03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:57.680
it's right. And unfortunately, because complexity is a generic phenomenon, and computational

03:26:57.680 --> 03:27:02.720
irreducibility is a generic phenomenon, that actually tells you nothing. And so then the

03:27:02.720 --> 03:27:06.560
question is, well, what can you do? You know, there's a lot of things that have been sort of

03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:11.040
done under this banner of complexity. And I think it's been very successful in providing sort of an

03:27:11.040 --> 03:27:15.920
interdisciplinary way of connecting different fields together. Which is powerful in itself.

03:27:15.920 --> 03:27:18.800
Right. I mean, that's a very useful economics. And yeah, it is.

03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:23.040
Right. It's a good organizing principle. But in the end, a lot of that is around this sort

03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:28.960
of computational paradigm, computational modeling. That's the raw material that powers that kind of

03:27:28.960 --> 03:27:33.360
correspondence, I think. But the question is sort of what is the, you know, I was just thinking

03:27:33.360 --> 03:27:39.280
recently, you know, we've been, I mean, the other, we've been, for years, people have told me,

03:27:39.280 --> 03:27:44.320
you should start some Wolfram Institute that does basic science. You know, all I have is a company

03:27:44.320 --> 03:27:48.480
that builds software and we, you know, we have a little piece that does basic science as kind

03:27:48.480 --> 03:27:53.360
of a hobby. People are saying, you should start this Wolfram Institute thing. And I've been,

03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:56.240
you know, because I've known about lots of institutes, and I've seen kind of their flow

03:27:56.240 --> 03:28:00.640
of money and kind of, you know, what happens in different situations and so on. So I've been

03:28:00.640 --> 03:28:05.920
kind of reluctant, but I have realized that, you know, what we've done with our company over the

03:28:05.920 --> 03:28:11.520
last 35 years, you know, we built a very good machine for doing R&D and, you know, innovating

03:28:11.520 --> 03:28:16.560
and creating things. And I just applied that machine to the physics project. That's how we

03:28:16.560 --> 03:28:22.320
did the physics project in a fairly short amount of time with a, you know, efficient machine with,

03:28:22.320 --> 03:28:28.160
you know, various people involved and so on. And so, you know, it works for basic science and it's

03:28:28.160 --> 03:28:34.480
like, we can do more of this. And so- And biology and chemistry, so it's become an institute.

03:28:34.480 --> 03:28:37.360
Yes. Well, it needs to become an institute. An official institute.

03:28:37.360 --> 03:28:42.640
Right. But the thing that, so I was thinking about, okay, so what do we do with complexity?

03:28:42.640 --> 03:28:47.680
You know, there are all these people who've, you know, what should happen to that field?

03:28:47.680 --> 03:28:52.720
And what I realized is there's kind of this area of foundations of complexity that's about

03:28:52.720 --> 03:28:56.800
these questions about simple programs, what they do, that's far away from a bunch of the

03:28:56.800 --> 03:29:02.560
detailed applications that people, well, it's not far away. It's the under, you know, the bedrock

03:29:02.560 --> 03:29:07.520
underneath those applications. And so I realized recently, this is my recent kind of little

03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:18.160
innovation of a sort, a post that I'll do very soon, about kind of, you know, the foundations

03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:23.680
of complexity, what really are they? I think there are really two ideas, two conceptual ideas

03:29:23.680 --> 03:29:28.240
that I hadn't really enunciated, I think, before. One is what I call meta-modeling,

03:29:28.240 --> 03:29:32.560
the other is rulliology. So what is meta-modeling? So meta-modeling is,

03:29:32.560 --> 03:29:36.720
you've got this complicated model, and it's a model of, you know, hedgehogs interacting with

03:29:36.720 --> 03:29:41.680
this, interacting with that. And the question is, what's really underneath that? What is it?

03:29:41.680 --> 03:29:47.680
You know, is it a Turing machine? Is it a cellular automaton? You know, what is the underlying stuff

03:29:47.680 --> 03:29:53.680
underneath that model? And so there's this kind of meta-science question of, given these models,

03:29:53.680 --> 03:29:58.480
what is the core model? And I realized, I mean, to me, that's sort of an obvious question. But

03:29:58.480 --> 03:30:03.120
then I realized, I've been doing language design for 40 years, and language design is exactly that

03:30:03.120 --> 03:30:07.760
question. You know, underneath all of this detailed stuff people do, what are the underlying

03:30:07.760 --> 03:30:12.160
primitives? And that's a question people haven't tended to ask about models. They say, well,

03:30:12.160 --> 03:30:16.000
we've got this nice model for this and that and the other, what's really underneath it?

03:30:16.000 --> 03:30:20.640
And what, you know, because once you have the thing that's underneath it, well, for example,

03:30:20.720 --> 03:30:25.440
this multi-computation idea is an ultimate meta-modeling idea, because it's saying

03:30:25.440 --> 03:30:30.800
underneath all these fields is one kind of paradigmatic structure. And, you know, you can

03:30:30.800 --> 03:30:38.320
imagine the same kind of thing at much more sort of, much sort of shallower levels in different

03:30:38.320 --> 03:30:44.320
kinds of modeling. So the first activity is this kind of meta-modeling, the kind of the models about

03:30:44.320 --> 03:30:49.680
models, so to speak. You know, what is the, what's, you know, drilling down into models?

03:30:49.680 --> 03:30:54.720
That's one thing. The other thing is this thing that I think we're going to call ruleology,

03:30:54.720 --> 03:30:58.720
which is kind of the, okay, you've got these simple rules. You've got cellular automata,

03:30:58.720 --> 03:31:02.240
you've got Turing machines, you've got substitution systems, you've got register machines,

03:31:02.240 --> 03:31:07.200
got all these different things. What do they actually do in the wild? And this is an area

03:31:07.200 --> 03:31:11.120
that I've spent a lot of time, you know, working on, and it's a lot of stuff in my new kind of

03:31:11.120 --> 03:31:16.400
science book is about this. You know, this new book I wrote about combinators is full of stuff

03:31:16.400 --> 03:31:21.840
like this. And this journal, Complex Systems, has lots of papers about these kinds of things.

03:31:21.840 --> 03:31:25.680
But there isn't really a home for people who do ruleology or what I'm not.

03:31:25.680 --> 03:31:29.520
It's the, as you call it, the basic science of rules.

03:31:29.520 --> 03:31:35.120
Yes. Yes, right. So it's like, you've got some, what is it? Is it mathematics? No,

03:31:35.120 --> 03:31:38.960
it isn't really like mathematics. In fact, from my now understanding of meta-mathematics,

03:31:38.960 --> 03:31:43.760
I understand that it's the molecular dynamics level. It's not the level that mathematicians

03:31:43.760 --> 03:31:47.760
have traditionally cared about. It's not computer science because computer science

03:31:47.760 --> 03:31:52.240
is about writing programs that do things, you know, that were for a purpose, not programs in

03:31:52.240 --> 03:31:56.160
the wild, so to speak. It's not physics. It doesn't have anything to do with, you know,

03:31:56.160 --> 03:32:01.120
it may be underneath some physics, but it's not physics as such. So it just hasn't had a home.

03:32:01.120 --> 03:32:07.520
And if you look at, you know, but what's great about it is it's a surviving field, so to speak.

03:32:07.520 --> 03:32:12.720
It's something where, you know, one of the things I find sort of inspiring about mathematics, for

03:32:12.720 --> 03:32:17.360
example, is you look at mathematics that was done, you know, in ancient Greece, ancient, you know,

03:32:17.360 --> 03:32:22.720
Babylon, Egypt, and so on. It's still here today. You know, you find an icosahedron that somebody

03:32:22.720 --> 03:32:28.640
made in ancient Egypt. You look at it, oh, that's a very modern thing. It's an icosahedron. You know,

03:32:28.640 --> 03:32:34.560
it's a timeless kind of activity. And this idea of studying simple rules and what they do,

03:32:34.560 --> 03:32:39.920
it's a timeless activity. And I can see that over the last 40 years or so as, you know,

03:32:39.920 --> 03:32:44.800
even with cellular automata, it's kind of like, you know, you can sort of catalog what are the

03:32:44.800 --> 03:32:50.000
different cellular automata used for. And, you know, like the simplest rules, like one,

03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:56.080
you might even know this one, rule 184. Rule 184 is a minimal model for road traffic flow.

03:32:56.080 --> 03:32:59.600
And, you know, it's also a minimal model for various other things. But it's kind of fun

03:32:59.600 --> 03:33:05.600
that you can literally say, you know, rule 90 is a minimal model for this and this and this. Rule

03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:10.880
94 is a minimal model for this. And it's kind of remarkable that you can just by, in this raw

03:33:10.880 --> 03:33:16.640
level of this kind of study of rules, they then branch, they're the raw material that you can use

03:33:16.640 --> 03:33:21.840
to make models of different things. So it's a very pure basic science, but it's one that,

03:33:21.840 --> 03:33:25.840
you know, people have explored it, but they've been kind of a little bit in the wilderness.

03:33:25.840 --> 03:33:31.360
And I think, you know, one of the things that I would like to do finally is, you know, I always

03:33:31.360 --> 03:33:37.040
thought that sort of this notion of pure NKS, pure NKS being the acronym for my book, New Kind

03:33:37.040 --> 03:33:43.440
of Science, was something that people should be doing. And, you know, we tried to figure out

03:33:43.440 --> 03:33:47.440
what's the right institutional structure to do this stuff. You know, we dealt with a bunch of

03:33:47.440 --> 03:33:51.360
universities. Oh, you know, can we do this here? Well, what department would it be in it? Well,

03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:56.320
it isn't in a department. It's its own new kind of thing. That's why the book was called

03:33:56.320 --> 03:34:01.600
the New Kind of Science. It's kind of the, because that's an increasingly good description

03:34:01.600 --> 03:34:07.280
of what it is, so to speak. We're actually, we were thinking about kind of the ruleological society,

03:34:07.280 --> 03:34:13.360
because we're realizing that it's kind of, you know, it's very interesting. I mean,

03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:17.600
I've never really done something like this before, because there's this whole group of researchers

03:34:17.600 --> 03:34:22.960
who have been doing things that are really, in some cases, very elegant, very surviving,

03:34:22.960 --> 03:34:27.440
very solid. You know, here's this thing that happens in this very abstract system.

03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:34.800
But it's like, what is that part of? You know, it doesn't have a home. And I think that's something

03:34:35.440 --> 03:34:39.600
I kind of fault myself for not having been more, you know, when complexity was developing in the

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:47.440
80s, I didn't understand the danger of applications. That is, it's really cool that you can apply this

03:34:47.440 --> 03:34:52.080
to economics, and you can apply it to evolutionary biology, and this and that and the other. But

03:34:52.080 --> 03:34:55.760
what happens with applications is everything gets sucked into the applications,

03:34:55.760 --> 03:35:00.880
and the pure stuff, it's like the pure mathematics. There isn't any pure mathematics, so to speak.

03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:06.800
It's all just applications of mathematics. And I failed to kind of make sure that this kind of pure

03:35:06.800 --> 03:35:13.840
area was kind of maintained and developed. And I think now, you know, one of the things I want

03:35:13.840 --> 03:35:19.200
to try to do, and you know, it's a funny thing, because I'm used to, look, I've been a tech CEO

03:35:19.200 --> 03:35:24.080
for more than half my life now. So, you know, this is what I know how to do. And, you know,

03:35:24.080 --> 03:35:30.080
I can make stuff happen and get projects to happen, even as it turns out basic science projects

03:35:30.080 --> 03:35:35.600
in that kind of setting, and how that translates into kind of, you know, there are a lot of people

03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:38.880
working on, for example, our physics projects that are distributed through the academic world,

03:35:38.880 --> 03:35:43.600
and that's working just great. But the question is, you know, can we have a sort of accelerator

03:35:43.600 --> 03:35:49.200
mechanism that makes use of kind of what we've learned in sort of R&D innovation?

03:35:49.200 --> 03:35:54.080
And, you know, but on the other hand, it's a funny thing, because, you know, in a company,

03:35:54.080 --> 03:35:59.520
in the end, the thing is, you know, it's a company, it makes products, it sells things to people.

03:36:00.560 --> 03:36:04.400
And, you know, when you're doing basic research, one of the challenges is there isn't that same

03:36:04.400 --> 03:36:11.920
kind of sort of mechanism. And so it's, you know, how do you drive the thing in a kind of led kind

03:36:11.920 --> 03:36:17.040
of way, so that it really can make forward progress, rather than, you know, what can often

03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:21.040
happen in, you know, in academic settings, where it's like, well, there are all these flowers

03:36:21.040 --> 03:36:24.400
blooming, but it's not clear that they're, you know, that it's-

03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:29.520
You have to have a central mission and a drive, just like you do with a company that's delivering

03:36:29.520 --> 03:36:34.320
a big overarching product, and that's- But the challenge is, you know, when you have

03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:40.320
the economics of the world are such that, you know, when you're delivering a product and people

03:36:40.320 --> 03:36:44.080
say, wow, that's useful, we'll buy it. And then that kind of feeds back and,

03:36:44.080 --> 03:36:49.920
okay, then you can pay the people who build it to eat, you know, so they can eat and so on.

03:36:49.920 --> 03:36:56.720
And with basic science, the payoff is very much less visible. And, you know, with this physics

03:36:56.720 --> 03:37:01.760
project, as I say, the big surprise has been that, I mean, you know, for example, well, the big

03:37:01.760 --> 03:37:07.920
surprise with the physics project is that it looks like it has near-term applications. And I was like,

03:37:07.920 --> 03:37:13.440
I'm guessing this is 200 years away. It's- I was kind of using the analogy of, you know,

03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:18.400
Newton starting a satellite launch company, which would have been kind of wrong time.

03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:24.880
And, you know, but it turns out that's not the case, but we can't guarantee that. And if you say,

03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:31.600
we're signing up to do basic research, basic radiology, let's say, and, you know, and we can't-

03:37:31.600 --> 03:37:36.000
We don't know the horizon, you know, it's an unknown horizon. It's kind of like an undecidable

03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:40.160
kind of proposition of when is this proof going to end, so to speak? When is it going to be

03:37:40.160 --> 03:37:48.720
something that gets applied? Well, I hope this becomes a vibrant new field of radiology. I love

03:37:48.720 --> 03:37:55.120
it. Like I told you many, many times, it's one of the most amazing ideas that has been brought to

03:37:55.120 --> 03:38:03.040
this world. So I hope you get a bunch of people to explore this world. Thank you once again for

03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:07.120
spending your really valuable time with me today. Fun stuff. Thank you.

03:38:08.320 --> 03:38:12.400
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Stephen Wolfram. To support this podcast,

03:38:12.400 --> 03:38:17.600
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:25.200
Richard Feynman. Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns. So each small

03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:32.080
piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry. Thank you for listening and

03:38:32.080 --> 03:38:34.080
hope to see you next time.
