00:00.000 --> 00:02.460
The following is a conversation with Thomas Tall,

00:02.460 --> 00:04.700
founder of Legendary Entertainment,

00:04.700 --> 00:06.820
known for producing blockbusters

00:06.820 --> 00:09.140
like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy,

00:09.140 --> 00:12.300
the Hangover franchise, Godzilla, Inception,

00:12.300 --> 00:15.700
Jurassic World, 300, and many more.

00:15.700 --> 00:18.180
He runs Talco, which is an investment company

00:18.180 --> 00:21.040
that focuses on how artificial intelligence

00:21.040 --> 00:23.860
can revolutionize large industries.

00:23.860 --> 00:26.460
He is part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.020
He's the guitarist for the band Ghost Hounds

00:29.040 --> 00:31.600
that tours with the Rolling Stones.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.320
But most importantly, he's humble, down to earth,

00:35.320 --> 00:38.360
and someone who has quickly become a mentor and friend.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.440

00:44.920 --> 00:48.760
And now, here's my conversation with Thomas Tall.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.240
In 2004, you founded Legendary Entertainment,

00:53.240 --> 00:55.000
known for producing blockbusters

00:55.000 --> 00:57.880
like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy,

00:57.900 --> 00:59.900
that includes Batman Begins, Dark Knight,

00:59.900 --> 01:03.280
and Dark Knight Rises, the Hangover franchise,

01:03.280 --> 01:05.900
Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300,

01:05.900 --> 01:07.220
and the list goes on.

01:07.220 --> 01:10.420
It's just some of the biggest movies in history.

01:10.420 --> 01:12.620
What does it take to make an epic movie like that?

01:12.620 --> 01:15.620
What does it take to make it happen from start to finish?

01:16.680 --> 01:19.640
Well, look, I've been enamored with movies

01:19.640 --> 01:21.340
since I was a kid as a fan,

01:21.340 --> 01:24.220
and I think what you need

01:24.220 --> 01:26.660
is to be able to tell a great story.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.720
And if you're gonna tell a great story,

01:28.720 --> 01:30.380
you need a great director.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.640
You gotta start with a fantastic script

01:33.880 --> 01:38.360
that is able to take some of these iconic characters

01:38.360 --> 01:41.080
that we did and put your own stamp on it

01:41.080 --> 01:44.880
while still respecting the mythology.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.720
And I had zero experience in movies and television

01:48.720 --> 01:50.220
before I started Legendary,

01:50.220 --> 01:53.200
so it was a very interesting trip.

01:53.220 --> 01:57.300
Total luck that we had the opportunity

01:57.300 --> 02:01.020
to make five movies at the time with Chris Nolan,

02:01.020 --> 02:03.140
who turned out to be one of the greatest filmmakers

02:03.140 --> 02:04.480
of all time.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.880
But each one is its own little startup company,

02:08.900 --> 02:12.000
and I don't think there's any formula to get there,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.140
but I know that if you don't have a great director

02:15.140 --> 02:15.980
and a great script,

02:15.980 --> 02:18.940
if you don't have that foundation, it's hard to pull off.

02:18.940 --> 02:21.140
Who's the CEO of that little startup company?

02:21.600 --> 02:25.080
The director, who would you say kind of defines the success

02:25.080 --> 02:26.400
or the failure of a movie?

02:26.400 --> 02:29.960
Well, when you build a big movie like that,

02:29.960 --> 02:33.320
it's an enormous effort, 360 degrees.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.760
I mean, from digital effects, certainly the actors.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.800
I mean, if you have an amazing script and amazing director,

02:40.800 --> 02:42.940
but you don't believe anybody playing the parts,

02:42.940 --> 02:43.780
that's a problem.

02:43.780 --> 02:47.880
So the reason I think it was so difficult to pull off

02:47.880 --> 02:48.760
is I always used to say,

02:48.820 --> 02:51.940
you start with a stack of papers with words on it

02:51.940 --> 02:55.820
called the script, bring that to life,

02:55.820 --> 02:58.500
and you're asking an audience to believe in everything

02:58.500 --> 03:00.340
that you're trying to put out there,

03:00.340 --> 03:02.900
and you've got a cast that,

03:02.900 --> 03:05.100
even if they're immensely talented individually,

03:05.100 --> 03:06.380
they have to mesh together,

03:06.380 --> 03:08.280
they have to have chemistry together.

03:09.820 --> 03:13.780
And the director is kind of the general on the battlefield,

03:13.780 --> 03:18.380
but if you have a strong producer who's very hands-on,

03:18.380 --> 03:22.360
but it truly, to me, is each one had its own story

03:22.360 --> 03:24.720
and its own sort of how it came to be

03:24.720 --> 03:27.360
and why it worked or didn't work.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.760
See, you said you were new to the industry,

03:30.760 --> 03:34.520
but you did a lot of revolutionary things with Legendary.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.640
So at that time and now, what is the good, the bad,

03:38.640 --> 03:41.360
and the ugly of the business of filmmaking?

03:41.360 --> 03:44.440
What are some interesting holes that you were able to,

03:44.440 --> 03:47.360
or problems that you were able to fix?

03:47.380 --> 03:50.880
What problems still exist that can still be solved?

03:51.920 --> 03:56.920
Well, look, the business has changed so radically since 2004.

03:58.260 --> 04:01.780
When I started Legendary, DVDs were still a cash cow.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.620
So that's how far things have come.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.160
But I would say a couple of things.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.780
The reason that I started it from a business perspective

04:10.780 --> 04:14.260
was at the time it was a $30 billion industry

04:14.260 --> 04:17.680
and there was no institutional capital

04:17.680 --> 04:19.680
around the movie business.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.880
And I was fascinated by that

04:20.880 --> 04:23.160
because almost every other category

04:23.160 --> 04:25.000
that you look at of that size

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
has institutional capital, private equity, et cetera,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.040
is kind of a cottage industry set up around it.

04:31.040 --> 04:35.040
And I was perplexed and fascinated that that didn't occur.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.800
And the way the movie business worked

04:36.800 --> 04:40.060
was unlike any business I'd ever looked at before.

04:40.060 --> 04:43.880
So after kind of convincing myself

04:43.880 --> 04:46.020
that you could actually make money

04:46.020 --> 04:48.580
if you were disciplined and had the right approach,

04:49.880 --> 04:52.340
went out, raised the money from the capital markets,

04:52.340 --> 04:54.780
markets which was Herculean,

04:54.780 --> 04:58.920
still maybe the hardest thing I've ever done in my career,

04:58.920 --> 05:02.020
to walk around and say, look, I have no experience.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.340
I've never done this before.

05:03.340 --> 05:08.340
But, and the second thing, being very fortunate at the time,

05:08.980 --> 05:11.780
was able to partner up with Warner Brothers.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.880
Warner's at the time was run by a man named Alan Horn,

05:15.880 --> 05:18.960
who besides being creative is also a Harvard MBA.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.700
So really understood what I wanted to do.

05:22.840 --> 05:26.360
And Alan was just an absolute gentleman,

05:26.360 --> 05:29.420
someone that I still look up to to this day.

05:29.420 --> 05:31.880
After Warner Brothers, he went and ran Disney

05:31.880 --> 05:35.680
with their run between Marvel and Star Wars and everything.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.680
And so between Alan being responsible for Harry Potter,

05:40.700 --> 05:43.100
the Dark Knight stuff, and then onto all the Disney stuff,

05:43.100 --> 05:44.580
he probably had as great a career

05:44.580 --> 05:48.020
as anyone I've ever heard of in the movie business.

05:48.020 --> 05:52.220
So my first focus was around sort of two concepts,

05:52.220 --> 05:57.220
global, worldwide, large tent pole films and franchises,

05:57.500 --> 05:59.700
and then the business aspect of being,

05:59.700 --> 06:03.380
bringing long-term institutional capital to bear.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.540
I'm gonna ask you dumb questions,

06:05.540 --> 06:10.460
which is part of the style, I guess.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.840
But just for people who don't know, including me,

06:13.840 --> 06:16.560
what is institutional, what is capital?

06:16.560 --> 06:18.360
What is institutional capital?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.720
What is equity, what is private equity?

06:20.720 --> 06:21.840
Got it, okay.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.120
Well, so if you're starting a company

06:27.080 --> 06:30.960
and you go around to a bunch of your successful friends

06:30.960 --> 06:34.040
and say, hey, you should invest in my company,

06:34.040 --> 06:37.400
well, that's sort of, that's great and it's capital,

06:37.400 --> 06:42.400
but it's not getting money from Fidelity or T-Row

06:42.700 --> 06:46.580
or a Sovereign Wealth Fund or an Endowment Fund

06:46.580 --> 06:51.580
from a university that has large pools of organized capital

06:52.100 --> 06:56.500
that has a long-term point of view on your business.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.240
So if you get money from your neighbor

06:59.240 --> 07:02.580
who's a successful dentist, next year,

07:02.580 --> 07:05.580
the dentist may say, hey, times are hard,

07:05.700 --> 07:07.380
I need my money back.

07:07.380 --> 07:10.660
If your partner's with Fidelity or Morgan Stanley

07:10.660 --> 07:12.460
or any of these institutions,

07:12.460 --> 07:16.160
they have the capital and the wherewithal to say,

07:16.160 --> 07:19.540
okay, I'm looking at this over the next five to 10 years.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.520
And I thought there was an opportunity

07:21.520 --> 07:26.520
to bring that type of capital to the movie business

07:26.640 --> 07:27.980
to be patient.

07:27.980 --> 07:32.780
And the benefit of that, patient, so it's long-term,

07:32.780 --> 07:34.980
you have to deal with fewer parties

07:34.980 --> 07:37.820
and they would do much larger investments.

07:38.780 --> 07:40.120
So what are the benefits?

07:40.120 --> 07:41.540
What are the sort of the challenges

07:41.540 --> 07:42.740
of that kind of investment?

07:42.740 --> 07:45.220
Well, I think the benefits in some ways

07:45.220 --> 07:48.940
are the professionals who are largely dispassionate, right?

07:48.940 --> 07:51.380
It's like, look, if you're hitting the numbers you told me

07:51.380 --> 07:54.080
and you're hitting your plan, great.

07:55.300 --> 07:58.900
And the other thing that always was interesting to me

07:58.900 --> 08:02.480
about the movie business is if I'm investing

08:02.480 --> 08:04.300
in an artificial intelligence company

08:04.300 --> 08:06.500
or a chipset company or something like that,

08:07.780 --> 08:11.900
a lot of the institutions don't have the technical expertise

08:11.900 --> 08:16.380
to really truly grasp what's being done.

08:16.380 --> 08:19.280
So they don't, other than good business practices,

08:19.280 --> 08:21.700
they're not offering every little opinion.

08:21.700 --> 08:25.160
The movies and television are completely approachable,

08:25.160 --> 08:27.860
meaning everybody has an opinion.

08:27.860 --> 08:30.360
So whether it's, I think you guys

08:30.360 --> 08:32.040
chose the wrong actor for that,

08:32.040 --> 08:33.380
or why did you do that movie?

08:34.380 --> 08:38.500
So it invites a lot more sort of second guessing

08:38.500 --> 08:39.520
and things like that.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.820
So that was always one of the idiosyncrasies

08:42.820 --> 08:46.440
of the business that I thought was interesting.

08:47.340 --> 08:50.260
And then when you talk about private equity

08:50.260 --> 08:52.860
versus public equity, if you're a public company

08:52.860 --> 08:56.180
where the companies are traded,

08:56.180 --> 08:57.580
you wanna buy Microsoft shares,

08:57.580 --> 08:59.540
you just go to your broker,

08:59.540 --> 09:01.820
go on TD Ameritrade and buy them.

09:01.820 --> 09:04.820
If on the other hand, you're talking about private equity,

09:04.820 --> 09:08.500
that's institutions or individuals

09:08.500 --> 09:11.180
investing in private companies.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.720
So thus, if you have pools of capital

09:13.720 --> 09:16.780
that mostly invest in private equity deals,

09:16.780 --> 09:18.580
that's how you think about it.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.220
It's difficult to make those happen

09:20.220 --> 09:23.580
because it's individuals, you have to sort of,

09:23.580 --> 09:26.500
what, have dinners and agree.

09:26.500 --> 09:31.180
So it's much less, it's much more human,

09:31.220 --> 09:33.620
much less mechanical, I would say.

09:33.620 --> 09:36.060
Yeah, now, and again, massive difference

09:36.060 --> 09:41.060
between large private equity shops who are professionalized

09:41.100 --> 09:44.420
and in the same category that I mentioned earlier

09:44.420 --> 09:49.340
versus private individuals who are wealthy or whatever.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.020
But again, it's much more individualized

09:52.020 --> 09:55.780
when you're going to people who like your idea

09:55.780 --> 09:58.500
and just say, I'd like to invest in this.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.940
Is that, from all the kinds of investments you've seen,

10:03.540 --> 10:05.240
what do you think is the most conducive

10:05.240 --> 10:08.700
to creating works of genius,

10:08.700 --> 10:11.140
whether that's in technology, AI space,

10:11.140 --> 10:12.420
or whether that's in movies?

10:12.420 --> 10:13.260
Sure.

10:13.260 --> 10:15.220
So creating something special in this world.

10:16.140 --> 10:18.820
I would say a couple of things.

10:18.820 --> 10:23.820
Enough money that whatever endeavor you're going into,

10:24.820 --> 10:28.500
that you're not so nervous about the edges, right?

10:28.500 --> 10:31.100
If my, if I have $100 to spend

10:31.100 --> 10:34.540
and I think I can create a perpetual motion machine

10:34.540 --> 10:38.800
or something for $104, I can't do it

10:38.800 --> 10:40.620
because they're all over me about the budget.

10:40.620 --> 10:44.180
So I would say making sure that you have enough capital,

10:44.180 --> 10:47.340
making sure that that capital is patient enough

10:47.340 --> 10:49.340
so that it's, if you're going to do things

10:49.340 --> 10:53.020
that are extraordinary, it takes some time

10:53.020 --> 10:55.140
and you're going to break stuff, right?

10:55.140 --> 10:56.220
You're going to make mistakes.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.860
You're going to have a whole bunch of film

10:58.860 --> 11:00.580
on the cutting room floor, so to speak.

11:00.580 --> 11:01.580
Or if you're in the lab,

11:01.580 --> 11:04.220
you're going to have a whole bunch of broken stuff.

11:04.220 --> 11:07.740
And I also think it's very important at the beginning,

11:07.740 --> 11:10.480
and I always try to do this with companies I invest in

11:10.480 --> 11:15.480
or buy, is make sure that you have a philosophical

11:15.580 --> 11:20.140
and somewhat mechanical alignment with the management team

11:20.140 --> 11:23.820
so that going in, you both understand,

11:23.820 --> 11:26.340
hey, this is how we think about this problem

11:26.340 --> 11:27.820
or this company.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.580
This is what we feel like our culture is.

11:30.580 --> 11:31.760
This is what our goal is.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.980
And these are the metrics by which we'll agree

11:33.980 --> 11:35.660
to measure them by.

11:35.660 --> 11:40.020
Because if you don't have that shared, you know,

11:40.020 --> 11:41.860
hey, we're going to take this journey,

11:42.740 --> 11:45.320
then I think that's where people get upset,

11:45.320 --> 11:47.100
disappointed, et cetera.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.940
What about, this is a weird question, but constraints.

11:50.940 --> 11:53.240
So this is both for filmmaking and investment.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.060
Do you think more money is always better?

11:57.060 --> 11:58.520
No.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.860
So I like constraints a lot.

12:01.860 --> 12:06.380
It's like constraints and almost like a desperation

12:06.380 --> 12:10.540
and deadlines are catalysts for creativity,

12:10.540 --> 12:15.260
for productivity, for sort of innovation.

12:15.260 --> 12:19.140
So can you kind of speak to that as an investor,

12:19.140 --> 12:23.460
as a creator, like what's the right balance here?

12:23.460 --> 12:27.620
Well, I think if you're focused on a particular problem

12:27.620 --> 12:31.980
or a company or a thesis, if you have that focus

12:31.980 --> 12:36.160
and you feel like I have unlimited resources

12:36.160 --> 12:39.260
or renewable resources, so there's really,

12:39.260 --> 12:43.540
there's no leverage in the situation, right?

12:43.540 --> 12:48.540
There's no, if I fail at this, I'll just go get more money.

12:49.180 --> 12:52.900
Right, I'll just go, I think that's a hard way

12:52.900 --> 12:57.900
to be resilient and to think of new ways to solve problems.

13:00.740 --> 13:05.220
So I think capitalizing things just, you know,

13:05.220 --> 13:08.660
to the nth degree does create some problems.

13:08.660 --> 13:10.420
So I think there's that perfect blend

13:10.420 --> 13:14.020
of don't starve the oxygen to the point

13:14.020 --> 13:15.960
where you make short-term decisions

13:15.960 --> 13:18.720
or non-strategic or thoughtful decisions

13:18.720 --> 13:20.380
because you got to pay the rent.

13:20.380 --> 13:24.860
And on the other hand, you can't have it be like this,

13:24.860 --> 13:28.940
you know, everlasting gobstopper of whatever you want

13:28.940 --> 13:30.420
will just keep flowing the cash

13:30.420 --> 13:33.060
because that doesn't create any friction points

13:33.060 --> 13:38.060
that I think do result in works of genius

13:38.980 --> 13:43.980
and things that, you know, that are transformative.

13:44.260 --> 13:48.460
And one of the things that is interesting to me

13:48.460 --> 13:51.900
about society sort of writ large

13:51.900 --> 13:56.900
is I think that when you go through hard times

13:59.020 --> 14:02.260
and you have to do things that are uncomfortable

14:02.260 --> 14:04.980
and you don't want to do them because you're tired,

14:04.980 --> 14:08.460
because that in some ways builds up

14:08.460 --> 14:12.740
that you're comfortable being uncomfortable muscle.

14:12.740 --> 14:17.740
And I sometimes think we're losing that a little bit.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.900
And you can't sort of paint with a wide brush,

14:20.900 --> 14:25.500
but, you know, that's one of the things

14:25.500 --> 14:30.500
that I kind of observe and hope that we don't go that way.

14:30.580 --> 14:34.260
I do think challenge and discomfort are a kind of gift

14:34.260 --> 14:36.980
as like overcoming that.

14:36.980 --> 14:40.220
It's like from every perspective, from a human perspective,

14:40.220 --> 14:42.420
it's a source of happiness and fulfillment,

14:42.420 --> 14:43.820
overcoming challenge.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.900
But from a business perspective,

14:45.900 --> 14:48.900
I see like if something is really difficult,

14:48.900 --> 14:51.780
to me it's also a sign that most others would

14:51.780 --> 14:54.460
or many others would fail at this point.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.980
So like, it's a feature.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.180
It's nice that something is difficult.

14:58.180 --> 15:02.140
When people tell you that something is impossible,

15:02.140 --> 15:04.020
I love that because it's like, all right,

15:04.740 --> 15:06.980
well then that's what a lot of people would believe.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.540
And that gives you an opportunity to be the person

15:09.540 --> 15:11.140
who shows it's not impossible.

15:11.140 --> 15:14.140
And of course you might be wrong, but if you're not wrong,

15:14.140 --> 15:15.620
you have the opportunity to stand out.

15:15.620 --> 15:18.820
So going through that hardship, taking those big risks,

15:18.820 --> 15:20.380
it's going to really pay off.

15:20.380 --> 15:25.380
So like discomfort is a feature, not a bug.

15:26.780 --> 15:30.140
Of both personal life, it's just good for life,

15:30.180 --> 15:34.780
but for business, it seems like just good business sense.

15:34.780 --> 15:38.660
If something is hard, it's probably a good idea to do that.

15:38.660 --> 15:39.500
Yeah.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.660
Because most others will fail.

15:41.580 --> 15:42.420
Fun question.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.580
I don't know if you can answer this,

15:43.580 --> 15:47.540
but what's the most expensive movie you were involved with

15:47.540 --> 15:49.860
to make and why was it?

15:49.860 --> 15:50.900
You don't have to say numbers,

15:50.900 --> 15:53.180
but like is something stand out

15:53.180 --> 15:57.420
as being exceptionally expensive and why is it expensive?

15:57.420 --> 16:01.460
Um, I think Jurassic World was pretty expensive.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.300
Nice.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.220
I mean, it worked out great.

16:05.740 --> 16:06.940
And...

16:06.940 --> 16:09.580
That's an epic film by the way.

16:09.580 --> 16:13.900
It, look, it's one of my favorites.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.180
They just did an amazing job.

16:16.180 --> 16:20.380
And frankly, the crazy thing about my life

16:20.380 --> 16:23.060
is all the stuff that I loved as a kid

16:23.060 --> 16:27.260
somehow came full circle back into my adult life.

16:28.100 --> 16:31.300
And having the opportunity while I was out there

16:31.300 --> 16:35.180
to develop a friendship with Steven Spielberg

16:35.180 --> 16:39.100
and then have my name on the same film as Steven Spielberg,

16:39.100 --> 16:42.740
I mean, that was pretty surreal.

16:44.300 --> 16:46.860
So that was an expensive film.

16:46.860 --> 16:49.780
You know, Dark Knight Rises was an expensive film.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.620
But again, to me, there's a difference

16:51.620 --> 16:54.460
between expensive and irresponsible

16:54.500 --> 16:58.580
and expensive because the vision warranted

16:58.580 --> 17:01.220
and it turned out financially, it certainly did.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.020
Yeah, with Jurassic World, it's...

17:04.380 --> 17:06.460
I mean, I can't even imagine having those meetings

17:06.460 --> 17:09.020
because like you have to create so much

17:09.020 --> 17:11.140
and so much of it is obviously not real.

17:11.140 --> 17:14.260
You can't bring dinosaurs in a...

17:14.260 --> 17:15.820
Yeah.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.500
Is that where a lot of the cost is,

17:17.500 --> 17:22.500
is in the, you know, the computer side of things?

17:22.580 --> 17:26.140
Yeah, those are generally pretty massive components

17:26.140 --> 17:30.180
of the budget and especially if you're doing it

17:30.180 --> 17:32.740
and inventing things as you go.

17:32.740 --> 17:36.540
I mean, Jim Cameron is one of those filmmakers

17:36.540 --> 17:41.540
who is designing the plane as it's flying

17:41.580 --> 17:43.940
in such a brilliant way.

17:43.940 --> 17:47.540
And I've got to know him over the years

17:47.540 --> 17:51.380
and just in awe of the way his brain works

17:51.380 --> 17:55.300
and so yeah, it's a big component.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.500
Can you speak a little bit more to him in terms of,

17:58.500 --> 18:01.060
because you're such a fascinating person

18:01.060 --> 18:02.940
because you care a lot about technology.

18:02.940 --> 18:06.020
You care a lot about the cutting edge of technology.

18:06.020 --> 18:10.300
So how does he, a creator, a director,

18:10.300 --> 18:12.460
build the plane while it's flying?

18:12.460 --> 18:15.620
Like what's the role of innovation in this whole process?

18:15.620 --> 18:20.060
Well, so I never made a film with Jim.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.660
I'm just a huge fan and got to know him

18:23.860 --> 18:26.380
and John Landau, his producing partner.

18:27.420 --> 18:30.660
And one of the things that just fascinates me about Jim

18:30.660 --> 18:32.620
is so he makes Titanic

18:32.620 --> 18:34.980
and there's a bunch of underwater cameras

18:34.980 --> 18:37.540
and things that they need that don't exist.

18:37.540 --> 18:39.820
So he goes and invents them

18:39.820 --> 18:43.980
and, you know, has a good grasp of engineering

18:43.980 --> 18:46.100
and has not only the imagination

18:46.100 --> 18:48.860
but the ability to lead a team to build them.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.940
I got to go down early when they were shooting Avatar

18:55.020 --> 18:57.900
at a warehouse, I think it was, where they were shooting.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.620
And as they were explaining to me

19:00.620 --> 19:01.980
how they were capturing it

19:01.980 --> 19:03.700
and that they could go back later

19:03.700 --> 19:08.540
because they created the environment, it blew my mind.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.180
And I said, okay, this is truly,

19:11.180 --> 19:12.980
people talk about a big leap.

19:12.980 --> 19:14.020
This certainly is one.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.700
So he has continued to push the envelope

19:18.700 --> 19:20.900
in terms of the art of the possible.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.740
And I just think he's an incredible genius in that way.

19:26.140 --> 19:27.740
Again, another hard question.

19:27.740 --> 19:32.020
So you in the realm of music care about storytelling.

19:33.500 --> 19:37.300
Is there some aspect in which money

19:37.300 --> 19:40.020
and beautiful graphics get in the way of story?

19:42.260 --> 19:47.140
In filmmaking, so if you think about Jurassic World,

19:47.140 --> 19:49.860
obviously that's an experience like any other.

19:52.340 --> 19:54.740
Like, what do you think about the tension

19:54.740 --> 19:59.740
between story, experience and like visual effects?

20:01.420 --> 20:06.420
Well, look, if you're using big effect shots

20:07.340 --> 20:10.500
and all kinds of tricks to cover over the fact

20:10.500 --> 20:13.620
that you don't have a very interesting story to tell,

20:13.620 --> 20:15.740
that's where I think it gets in the way.

20:17.700 --> 20:21.780
Where I think you have these incredible filmmakers,

20:21.780 --> 20:23.500
we mentioned Chris Nolan and Jim Cameron,

20:23.500 --> 20:28.140
Guillermo del Toro, you know, you could go on and on

20:29.300 --> 20:33.980
folks that just see the world differently

20:33.980 --> 20:38.780
and use technology to enhance the storytelling, right?

20:38.780 --> 20:42.620
To make you believe differently,

20:42.620 --> 20:46.780
rather to make you not just suspend your disbelief,

20:46.780 --> 20:49.380
but to feel like you're immersed in it.

20:49.380 --> 20:52.260
So I've certainly seen it done expertly

20:52.260 --> 20:54.580
and I've seen it done poorly.

20:54.580 --> 20:57.420
You've talked about this a little bit in the past.

20:57.420 --> 21:02.100
You've kind of left the moviemaking business

21:02.100 --> 21:03.500
at an interesting time.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.620
Perhaps you saw the changes.

21:07.020 --> 21:10.100
There's been a lot of excitement with Netflix, with TV.

21:10.100 --> 21:13.820
So the role of film in society has changed.

21:13.860 --> 21:18.180
So what do you think is the future of movies versus TV?

21:18.180 --> 21:21.460
Like if you were as a business person, as a creator,

21:21.460 --> 21:24.820
as a consumer, as a technologist,

21:24.820 --> 21:27.500
are thinking about the next 10, 20 years,

21:27.500 --> 21:31.980
what do you think is going to be the godfather,

21:31.980 --> 21:36.060
the great pieces that move us as a society

21:36.060 --> 21:37.340
in the next 10, 20 years?

21:37.340 --> 21:38.220
Is it going to be TV?

21:38.220 --> 21:39.660
Is it going to be movie?

21:39.660 --> 21:43.660
Is it going to be TikTok clips?

21:44.620 --> 21:48.580
Well, so, and I think the other category

21:48.580 --> 21:50.060
that I would add to that,

21:50.060 --> 21:52.300
that will be the next great medium

21:52.300 --> 21:55.060
is truly immersive virtual reality

21:56.020 --> 22:00.540
in which new storytellers will emerge,

22:00.540 --> 22:02.980
especially when you can go into VR

22:03.860 --> 22:08.300
and there's enough computing power to sustain it

22:08.300 --> 22:10.340
and to allow it to be social

22:10.340 --> 22:14.700
and for you to have different paths to go down,

22:14.700 --> 22:17.020
that'll be, I think, the next realm

22:17.020 --> 22:20.100
of what storytelling and experience will look like.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.140
Do you think video game kind of world

22:22.140 --> 22:26.180
or is it more movies or is it more social network

22:26.180 --> 22:30.020
or is it all of it kind of blending reality

22:30.020 --> 22:31.780
and gaming and movies?

22:31.780 --> 22:35.100
Yeah, I thought if you saw Ready Player One,

22:35.100 --> 22:37.820
which I love the book and the movie was cool too,

22:38.820 --> 22:42.940
but that's one version of it, right?

22:42.940 --> 22:44.620
Where you go in,

22:44.620 --> 22:46.580
now everybody's talking about the metaverse and all that,

22:46.580 --> 22:50.340
but you go into a world that's fully rendered as yourself

22:50.340 --> 22:51.500
and you interact with that world.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.820
The other side of it is to go in somewhere

22:54.820 --> 22:57.740
between being a passive observer

22:57.740 --> 23:00.060
but being able to move around your point of view

23:00.060 --> 23:03.260
and experiences, which I think is interesting.

23:03.260 --> 23:07.100
And then I think another adventure, so to speak,

23:07.100 --> 23:10.340
I could think of is a blend of video games,

23:10.340 --> 23:12.020
so there's a mission, right?

23:12.020 --> 23:14.580
There's obstacles, there's everything

23:14.580 --> 23:17.900
and you move through it, but it's immersive

23:17.900 --> 23:19.620
and it tells a story at the same time.

23:19.620 --> 23:22.740
And that's why I think you're gonna see

23:22.740 --> 23:27.740
new amazing storytellers that we don't know yet

23:27.860 --> 23:29.740
that understand how to innovate

23:29.740 --> 23:32.860
and how to make you feel something in that environment.

23:34.540 --> 23:35.980
And to your earlier point,

23:37.260 --> 23:40.740
I think we saw probably around 2015

23:41.820 --> 23:45.780
when Netflix decided to be bold,

23:45.780 --> 23:49.500
put out House of Cards, put out all the episodes,

23:49.500 --> 23:51.300
leave you in charge of the pace

23:51.300 --> 23:52.820
at which you would view them,

23:53.740 --> 23:56.420
which I thought was great.

23:56.420 --> 23:57.780
That was a gutsy move.

23:57.780 --> 23:58.740
Yes, it was.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.620
And I can't tell you around Hollywood,

24:00.620 --> 24:02.260
anybody that says that everybody thought

24:02.260 --> 24:04.540
it was a great idea is not being truthful

24:04.540 --> 24:08.340
because everybody I talked to said this is,

24:08.340 --> 24:10.140
they're idiots, right?

24:10.140 --> 24:13.460
What do they know about moviemaking and TV?

24:13.460 --> 24:17.820
And what I saw happening was,

24:17.820 --> 24:20.180
if you look at what Netflix pulled off

24:20.180 --> 24:22.740
and they realized that there isn't really a moat

24:22.740 --> 24:26.340
around the studios, you really could make stuff

24:28.100 --> 24:29.580
and really good stuff.

24:29.580 --> 24:31.980
And so they started to create their own content.

24:32.820 --> 24:36.140
That pulled in Amazon,

24:36.140 --> 24:38.500
which pulled in Google through YouTube,

24:38.500 --> 24:40.580
and then you had Hulu,

24:40.580 --> 24:43.260
then you had Disney deciding

24:43.260 --> 24:44.660
that they're gonna have Disney Plus.

24:44.660 --> 24:46.700
And the next thing you know,

24:46.700 --> 24:48.900
you have some of the biggest companies

24:48.900 --> 24:51.100
with the largest balance sheets on the planet

24:52.300 --> 24:54.020
being in the creative business.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.460
If you're an independent,

24:56.460 --> 25:00.580
that's bringing a knife to a gunfight to be sure.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.740
And so, I thought that was interesting.

25:03.740 --> 25:05.620
The other thing that it used to be

25:05.620 --> 25:08.340
that movies were where the big things happened

25:08.340 --> 25:11.540
and television was sort of small screen,

25:11.540 --> 25:13.140
different experience.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.780
And you had something like Game of Thrones come out,

25:15.780 --> 25:19.860
which was not only on the same epic level visually

25:19.860 --> 25:21.140
and storytelling wise,

25:21.140 --> 25:24.060
but had the budget to be able to do it.

25:24.060 --> 25:27.620
And now I think you're seeing,

25:28.140 --> 25:33.140
you're seeing all kinds of different storytelling

25:33.140 --> 25:34.700
taking place.

25:34.700 --> 25:39.220
And also like that you're not pigeonholed into a time.

25:39.220 --> 25:41.580
Like you got two hours to tell the story.

25:41.580 --> 25:43.140
You can do a three part mini series,

25:43.140 --> 25:44.460
a five part mini series.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.540
You can do television that's,

25:46.540 --> 25:48.100
all kinds of different format.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.660
And that I think is,

25:50.980 --> 25:54.100
allows creators to do a lot more interesting things.

25:54.340 --> 25:57.820
It is also interesting to consider the role of companies

25:57.820 --> 26:01.700
that enable that, like the capital that enables that.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.500
Without Netflix, you wouldn't,

26:03.500 --> 26:08.500
and HBO, you wouldn't have some of these epic shows.

26:08.580 --> 26:11.540
And so if we're thinking about the virtual reality world

26:11.540 --> 26:12.900
that you're talking about,

26:13.820 --> 26:16.380
it's interesting to consider who will enable that.

26:16.380 --> 26:19.700
Now, like you said, Facebook is talking about meta

26:19.700 --> 26:21.020
and metaverse.

26:21.060 --> 26:25.060
But it's unclear that just having money is enough.

26:25.060 --> 26:27.900
Netflix did a lot of really revolutionary stuff.

26:27.900 --> 26:30.500
There's a, you know, Amazon has money.

26:30.500 --> 26:31.820
There's a lot of companies that have money

26:31.820 --> 26:34.820
that don't quite do as good of a job yet

26:34.820 --> 26:39.820
at enabling creators of creating revolutionary new content

26:40.820 --> 26:42.940
that changes the whole industry.

26:42.940 --> 26:44.500
And that's probably going to be the case

26:44.500 --> 26:45.940
with virtual reality.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.500
There is a lot of stuff that's happening

26:48.500 --> 26:49.420
with virtual reality.

26:49.420 --> 26:54.140
There is a lot of money needed to enable experiences,

26:54.140 --> 26:57.020
like in terms of compute infrastructure.

26:57.020 --> 26:59.540
There needs to be a huge amount of money there,

26:59.540 --> 27:02.860
but you also need to somehow give freedom to creators

27:02.860 --> 27:05.900
to have fun, to do their best work.

27:05.900 --> 27:07.900
And at the same time,

27:07.900 --> 27:12.620
like provide the perfect amount of constraints,

27:12.620 --> 27:13.460
all of that together.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.180
Like however Netflix makes it happen,

27:15.180 --> 27:16.460
they do a pretty good job

27:16.500 --> 27:18.900
because it's a very constrained platform,

27:18.900 --> 27:21.380
but yet all the creators I've ever talked to,

27:21.380 --> 27:24.340
comedians and so on that work with Netflix

27:24.340 --> 27:27.940
are really happy because they feel free to create their work.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.580
Yeah, and I think a lot of times, you know,

27:30.580 --> 27:32.620
companies are a letterhead,

27:32.620 --> 27:34.540
but it boils down to the people.

27:34.540 --> 27:38.740
And I think I've known Ted Sarandos a long time

27:38.740 --> 27:40.860
who ran the studio at Netflix

27:40.860 --> 27:44.460
and now took over for Reed running the company.

27:44.460 --> 27:47.660
But Ted, very smart, talented guy

27:47.660 --> 27:50.900
and understood early how to cultivate talent

27:50.900 --> 27:53.540
and relationships with talent, which is important.

27:53.540 --> 27:56.220
When you're dealing with creative people,

27:56.220 --> 27:58.300
their motivations and their goals

27:58.300 --> 28:00.020
are not always the same, right?

28:00.020 --> 28:02.420
They're not always capitalistic, right?

28:02.420 --> 28:05.900
And so in terms of being able to communicate

28:05.900 --> 28:10.660
with creative people that are not always A to B to C

28:10.660 --> 28:11.940
is a talent.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.180
And so I think they did a great job.

28:14.180 --> 28:16.300
Ted did a great job with that early.

28:18.020 --> 28:21.460
But I think that you're gonna see different formats.

28:21.460 --> 28:26.220
I don't think, I mean, going to a theater

28:26.220 --> 28:30.580
to see a massive movie on that screen in that format

28:30.580 --> 28:33.260
is a fundamentally different experience.

28:33.260 --> 28:36.220
And I think you're gonna find movies,

28:36.220 --> 28:38.820
my old shop Legendary just put out Dune,

28:38.820 --> 28:41.420
which I thought was phenomenal.

28:42.260 --> 28:46.660
I, you know, when we secured the rights to Dune years ago,

28:48.700 --> 28:51.420
I was over the moon because it's, I love the book.

28:51.420 --> 28:56.420
I love the entire world that is Dune.

28:57.180 --> 28:59.900
And that's a movie that I think you see on the big screen.

28:59.900 --> 29:03.300
I think when Avatar 2 comes out,

29:03.300 --> 29:06.020
I wanna see that on a big screen.

29:06.020 --> 29:09.580
But I think you're gonna see a ton of content

29:09.580 --> 29:11.420
is obviously being produced,

29:11.420 --> 29:14.140
and it's not all gonna go to a theater going experience.

29:14.140 --> 29:17.180
So you're gonna see, I think, different versions of this

29:17.180 --> 29:18.780
over the next five to 10 years.

29:19.740 --> 29:22.100
In case James Cameron is listening to this,

29:22.100 --> 29:25.260
so he officially agreed to talk at the time of,

29:25.260 --> 29:27.820
on this podcast at the time of Avatar 2 release.

29:27.820 --> 29:28.860
I'm just holding you to that

29:28.860 --> 29:30.660
in this recorded conversation.

29:31.860 --> 29:36.540
Also just super excited, both the movie and the director.

29:37.060 --> 29:41.260
There's something special about movies.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.300
You know, they win Oscars.

29:43.300 --> 29:46.740
They're historic in nature.

29:46.740 --> 29:48.500
There's something about TV shows,

29:48.500 --> 29:50.980
even when they're epic, like Game of Thrones,

29:50.980 --> 29:54.340
that they're forgotten much quicker in history.

29:54.340 --> 29:55.980
I don't know, maybe that's because

29:55.980 --> 29:57.700
we haven't had enough of them,

29:57.700 --> 30:00.180
but you know, the De Niro performances

30:00.180 --> 30:02.820
and you know, the Scorsese films,

30:02.820 --> 30:06.180
all the great films that kind of we think of

30:06.180 --> 30:07.300
throughout the generations,

30:07.300 --> 30:10.300
that define generations, are films.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.980
Is that just old school thinking?

30:12.980 --> 30:14.420
Is that always going to be the case?

30:14.420 --> 30:16.020
I mean, look, to me,

30:18.300 --> 30:21.340
going in a darkened theater with a bunch of strangers

30:21.340 --> 30:24.980
and the lights go down and you go on this journey,

30:26.140 --> 30:29.980
there is something special and magical about that.

30:29.980 --> 30:33.460
And I think movies have been a part

30:33.460 --> 30:36.060
of our cultural fabric forever.

30:36.940 --> 30:40.340
And for some reason, Hollywood and America

30:40.340 --> 30:45.340
was uniquely positioned to do a great job with it, right?

30:45.980 --> 30:48.060
And not that there aren't great foreign movies,

30:48.060 --> 30:53.060
but far and away, American movies dominate

30:53.180 --> 30:54.500
not only the world market,

30:55.620 --> 30:58.300
and so whatever it is that we do well,

30:58.300 --> 30:59.740
or Hollywood does well,

31:02.020 --> 31:03.580
there's something in the water apparently.

31:03.580 --> 31:07.860
But I agree that I love movies

31:07.860 --> 31:10.580
and I will, you know, for the rest of my days,

31:10.580 --> 31:13.460
it's interesting how creators can move

31:13.460 --> 31:15.620
back and forth now as well.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.300
That used to be a complete no-no.

31:17.300 --> 31:20.180
You're either a movie guy or you're a person

31:20.180 --> 31:24.580
or you know, or you're a TV director and that's that.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.620
But those lines have completely blurred.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.460
And they're also blurring,

31:29.460 --> 31:31.140
I mean, they're blurring all kinds of lines.

31:31.140 --> 31:36.140
Like they're moving to TikTok and Instagram and like,

31:36.260 --> 31:38.620
I know right now it seems ridiculous

31:38.620 --> 31:42.740
to consider that these like one minute things

31:43.700 --> 31:47.340
could be considered even in the same realm creatively

31:47.340 --> 31:50.620
as a film, but maybe that changes over time too.

31:50.620 --> 31:53.260
Maybe experiences can completely become fluid

31:53.260 --> 31:55.780
in terms of their size,

31:55.780 --> 31:59.620
as long as they have some deep lasting impact on you

31:59.620 --> 32:02.180
as a human being, as a consumer.

32:02.180 --> 32:06.380
Look, to me, the whole thing is about

32:06.380 --> 32:09.100
either the moving image or even sometimes a picture

32:10.020 --> 32:13.460
will bring out an emotion, a reaction, something.

32:13.460 --> 32:17.140
So, you know, short form is harder

32:17.140 --> 32:19.580
because you have less time to set things up and all that,

32:19.580 --> 32:22.860
but I'm sure there will be short videos

32:22.860 --> 32:24.620
and creators that come up with things.

32:24.620 --> 32:29.580
And if a moving image can get a reaction out of you,

32:30.540 --> 32:32.100
and make you feel a certain way

32:32.100 --> 32:33.820
and stay with you or inspire you,

32:33.820 --> 32:36.420
well, that to me is just the next evolution

32:36.420 --> 32:38.380
of whatever it's gonna be

32:38.380 --> 32:41.060
between humans and cameras, et cetera.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.740
See, I think that's why we've talked offline about this.

32:44.740 --> 32:47.980
That's why I love robots is I think there's certain things

32:47.980 --> 32:51.220
in the short form with robots that immediately

32:51.220 --> 32:54.020
can bring out a feeling in people.

32:54.020 --> 32:57.540
There's something about our consideration

32:57.540 --> 33:01.140
of our own intelligence, of our own consciousness,

33:01.140 --> 33:03.420
of all the fears and hopes

33:03.420 --> 33:06.140
and the beautiful things about human nature,

33:06.140 --> 33:09.260
the dark things about human nature that somehow,

33:09.260 --> 33:11.780
especially legged robots bring out

33:11.780 --> 33:15.380
because we have both a fear and excitement towards that.

33:15.380 --> 33:17.380
Are these going to be our overlords,

33:17.380 --> 33:20.740
our gods that overtake humanity?

33:20.740 --> 33:24.380
Are these going to be things like horses

33:24.380 --> 33:27.140
or something like that, something that empower humanity?

33:27.740 --> 33:28.940
Like you don't know what to make sense of it.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.900
That's why they're super exciting.

33:30.900 --> 33:31.740
I agree.

33:31.740 --> 33:33.340
Speaking of robots and film,

33:34.380 --> 33:36.580
you've gone into traditional industries

33:36.580 --> 33:40.300
and disrupted them quite a few times.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.060
Was there, is there a system for deciding

33:43.060 --> 33:45.780
which industry is right for disruption?

33:45.780 --> 33:49.020
When you look at the world and see

33:49.020 --> 33:52.460
what are the big problems you would like to solve,

33:53.740 --> 33:56.580
do you have a system of how you see which problems to solve?

33:56.580 --> 33:58.980
How do you look at the world?

33:58.980 --> 34:01.420
Yeah, well, on the business side of that,

34:02.420 --> 34:04.780
so I have a holding company called Tulco,

34:04.780 --> 34:07.420
very imaginatively named.

34:07.420 --> 34:11.540
Part of that is literally every name ever is now taken,

34:11.540 --> 34:13.220
registered and all that stuff.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.820
So we're a holding company.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.020
What's a holding company?

34:18.020 --> 34:19.980
So instead of being a fund

34:19.980 --> 34:22.300
that has money flowing in and out of it,

34:22.300 --> 34:24.940
and there's what's called a vintage year,

34:24.940 --> 34:28.620
I raise capital and I agree to invest that capital

34:28.620 --> 34:30.740
for so long and then I give it back to you,

34:30.740 --> 34:33.700
which sometimes creates artificial time pressures

34:33.700 --> 34:34.540
and things like that.

34:34.540 --> 34:38.140
A holding company is more permanent capital.

34:38.140 --> 34:41.460
So the idea was, behind Tulco,

34:41.460 --> 34:44.820
was to buy almost always whole companies

34:44.820 --> 34:47.900
or majority stakes with great management teams

34:47.900 --> 34:50.300
in spaces that did not traditionally

34:50.300 --> 34:52.100
have a lot of innovation.

34:53.060 --> 34:57.540
And to have our labs group who were data scientists,

34:57.540 --> 35:02.540
AI practitioners, engineers, machine learning, et cetera,

35:03.180 --> 35:07.180
and to be able to bring that wherewithal to that company.

35:07.180 --> 35:10.220
So to provide them with the right capital

35:10.220 --> 35:13.180
and to provide them with access to technology

35:13.180 --> 35:16.700
that would be hard to individually recruit

35:16.700 --> 35:17.620
for that company.

35:17.820 --> 35:22.820
So I would say that the thesis was to look for industries

35:23.220 --> 35:27.220
that were large enough that hadn't traditionally had access

35:27.220 --> 35:30.460
to that type of technology or innovation

35:30.460 --> 35:32.460
and to try to look for companies

35:33.460 --> 35:36.620
that not only looked that part,

35:36.620 --> 35:40.140
but had management teams that embraced this

35:40.140 --> 35:41.980
and wanted to take that kind of journey.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.740
Yeah, there is quite a few industries like that,

35:44.780 --> 35:49.780
but that finding the industries

35:49.820 --> 35:52.100
and the management pair,

35:52.100 --> 35:54.340
because those industries often have a lot

35:54.340 --> 35:56.380
of old school folks who don't.

35:57.700 --> 35:59.140
It takes quite a bit of work for them

35:59.140 --> 36:00.900
to leap into technology.

36:00.900 --> 36:03.500
I work quite a bit with the autonomous vehicles

36:03.500 --> 36:06.060
and just the automotive industry.

36:06.060 --> 36:08.860
Depending on the company, there's old school folks.

36:08.860 --> 36:11.420
It's like Detroit thinking versus like,

36:11.420 --> 36:12.240
what do you call it?

36:12.920 --> 36:14.320
California thinking.

36:15.200 --> 36:18.720
Well, I think you have to look at the nexus

36:18.720 --> 36:19.560
of two things there.

36:19.560 --> 36:22.560
One is just plain old human behavior.

36:22.560 --> 36:27.560
If I am uncomfortable and this isn't a comfort zone for me

36:27.760 --> 36:31.120
and it's not something I have as a field of expertise,

36:31.120 --> 36:33.200
I'm gonna shy away from that.

36:33.200 --> 36:36.640
Especially if I'm successful and I feel good about myself

36:36.640 --> 36:38.640
and it's a big successful company or person

36:38.640 --> 36:39.840
or whatever it might be.

36:40.360 --> 36:44.160
And the second thing is that,

36:44.160 --> 36:45.840
especially if you're a public company

36:45.840 --> 36:48.480
and you're being weighed and measured every quarter,

36:48.480 --> 36:52.440
you are rewarding the managers of that company

36:52.440 --> 36:55.320
to hit metrics and to be reliable and to say,

36:55.320 --> 36:57.240
hey, I'm counting quarter to quarter

36:57.240 --> 36:59.720
that you're gonna deliver what you say.

37:00.800 --> 37:03.360
It's difficult to say, you know what everybody,

37:03.360 --> 37:05.640
for the next two years, I wouldn't count

37:05.640 --> 37:08.360
on our financial projections at all,

37:08.360 --> 37:10.720
because we're gonna reinvent what we're doing.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.240
It's gonna work in the long run

37:13.240 --> 37:15.680
and you're gonna see that this was a really smart investment

37:15.680 --> 37:17.120
five to seven years from now.

37:18.720 --> 37:22.800
That's not the way capitalism is currently wired,

37:22.800 --> 37:24.280
generally, right?

37:24.280 --> 37:28.200
And a lot of, so again, if you reward managers

37:28.200 --> 37:31.240
with yearly bonuses and stock options based

37:31.240 --> 37:35.600
and tied to stock price and all these other things,

37:36.240 --> 37:38.280
and then ask them to go break stuff,

37:39.480 --> 37:41.120
that's hard, I think.

37:41.120 --> 37:46.120
So you're saying like, so the talk approach

37:46.480 --> 37:50.120
to the private investment is the best way

37:50.120 --> 37:52.760
or perhaps the only way to enable

37:52.760 --> 37:54.440
this kind of long-term innovation,

37:54.440 --> 37:57.640
investment taking big risks and investing in innovation.

37:57.640 --> 38:00.640
Well, look, we certainly are not,

38:00.640 --> 38:02.320
by any means, the only one doing it.

38:02.320 --> 38:06.120
I'm just saying that when you think about big companies,

38:06.120 --> 38:10.840
the more successful that are in old line businesses,

38:10.840 --> 38:13.320
and I hear people sort of talk about,

38:13.320 --> 38:15.080
well, why can't they just pivot?

38:15.080 --> 38:19.360
They recognize they need to be in the technology business

38:19.360 --> 38:20.600
because it's hard.

38:20.600 --> 38:24.120
It's hard to steer a ship and turn it that big,

38:24.120 --> 38:27.680
and especially if it's not part of your DNA at that company.

38:28.680 --> 38:33.680
So I just think that what we tried to do

38:33.680 --> 38:38.680
is to enable management teams that know where they wanna go

38:40.800 --> 38:43.280
and to be patient with capital,

38:43.280 --> 38:48.280
and also, again, bring innovation to bear

38:48.480 --> 38:51.000
that they have access to.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.640
There's plenty of capital structures

38:52.640 --> 38:54.360
doing interesting things.

38:54.360 --> 38:57.520
That's one of the things I love about our country.

38:58.360 --> 39:01.680
This country innovates, and this country invents things,

39:01.680 --> 39:06.680
and I'm constantly in awe of just the human ability

39:10.560 --> 39:13.400
to innovate and to iterate.

39:14.840 --> 39:18.000
I get to hang around some universities,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.560
including your old shop, MIT, and it's like-

39:20.560 --> 39:21.400
I'm still there.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.240
Yeah, you're still there.

39:22.240 --> 39:23.080
Still teaching there.

39:23.080 --> 39:26.160
Still teaching, but that place is like Hogwarts.

39:26.160 --> 39:30.680
I mean, it's inspiring, right?

39:30.680 --> 39:34.040
And certainly the energy in Silicon Valley,

39:34.040 --> 39:37.400
which now Austin, Texas, where we're sitting,

39:37.400 --> 39:40.720
has its own incredible ecosystem.

39:40.720 --> 39:45.040
So that's one of the things I love about America

39:45.040 --> 39:49.160
is the ability, and that really is, I think,

39:49.160 --> 39:53.680
in the American DNA to create things and invent things,

39:53.680 --> 39:55.920
and I think that's invigorating.

39:56.760 --> 39:59.080
And I think that's even bigger than capitalism,

39:59.080 --> 40:02.160
the machine of how capitalism works.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.680
That's just human nature.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.200
Capitalism is just one of the ways

40:05.200 --> 40:10.200
to make that human nature shine, I suppose,

40:10.640 --> 40:13.320
but it's like, you mentioned MIT.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.760
There's a drive there to invent, to innovate.

40:20.760 --> 40:25.040
That's so purely human.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.120
It's a human spirit to sort of build something new.

40:28.120 --> 40:30.160
It's like that hopeful, optimistic spirit,

40:30.160 --> 40:32.040
especially in the engineering space.

40:32.040 --> 40:33.600
Like if you pay attention to the internet,

40:33.600 --> 40:36.200
like Twitter and all that kind of stuff,

40:36.200 --> 40:38.200
intellectuals and so on,

40:38.200 --> 40:43.200
there's a cynicism to when we talk about stuff,

40:43.320 --> 40:46.920
but there's an optimism to when we do stuff.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.360
And the doing part,

40:48.360 --> 40:50.880
when you actually build things especially,

40:50.880 --> 40:52.880
like you care a lot about manufacturing too.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.840
Like you actually build physical products,

40:55.840 --> 40:59.120
that's where we truly shine.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.040
Yeah, no question about it.

41:01.040 --> 41:06.040
And I'm passionate about our country making stuff again,

41:07.800 --> 41:09.560
doing our own manufacturing

41:10.840 --> 41:14.000
and making sure that we don't lose the ability,

41:14.000 --> 41:17.960
not just to create things intellectually

41:17.960 --> 41:19.520
and do the world's greatest blueprints,

41:19.520 --> 41:22.040
but actually make things here.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.080
Actual factories.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.280
Yeah, that's exactly right.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.120
How do we do that?

41:26.120 --> 41:30.640
How do we bring more manufacturing to the United States?

41:30.640 --> 41:32.040
Well, there's a company

41:32.040 --> 41:35.960
that I have a big personal investment in called Rebuild

41:37.160 --> 41:42.160
with some folks that all went through the MIT school

41:43.360 --> 41:45.080
years ago.

41:45.080 --> 41:47.120
There's a good friend of mine named Jeff Wilkie

41:47.120 --> 41:49.680
who used to be at Amazon.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.240
And we all felt the same way

41:51.240 --> 41:54.840
that America needed to make sure

41:54.840 --> 41:56.560
that it didn't lose its edge in that way.

41:56.560 --> 42:00.240
So it's a company that invests

42:00.240 --> 42:03.920
in American high-tech manufacturing.

42:03.920 --> 42:07.520
And I think the way that we do that is provide capital,

42:07.520 --> 42:09.600
provide training.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.400
To me, this is also fertile ground

42:11.400 --> 42:14.320
for good, sustainable, high-paying jobs.

42:15.320 --> 42:20.320
And we have to make it economically feasible

42:21.280 --> 42:24.080
to do that again here in this country

42:24.080 --> 42:26.480
and not to say to companies that again

42:26.480 --> 42:28.800
are being weighed and measured quarter by quarter,

42:28.800 --> 42:31.480
hey, this is three times as expensive to do it here,

42:31.480 --> 42:33.120
but you should do it here.

42:33.120 --> 42:36.960
We need to innovate and we need to create processes

42:36.960 --> 42:41.960
and companies and opportunity that balance that equation.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.440
And I think as we saw during the pandemic,

42:45.880 --> 42:47.200
I don't think in this day and age

42:47.200 --> 42:48.640
you can be an isolationist.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.480
That doesn't make any sense to me,

42:51.480 --> 42:54.880
but being self-reliant and self-determinant

42:54.880 --> 42:59.880
and making sure that you are never in a position as a nation

43:00.440 --> 43:01.880
that we can't do basic things

43:01.880 --> 43:05.320
because we're relying on supply chain in other countries.

43:05.320 --> 43:09.360
And whether it's we're not friends anymore

43:09.360 --> 43:13.920
or a natural disaster or a virus or something pops up,

43:13.920 --> 43:17.200
I think those are costs of doing business

43:17.200 --> 43:20.040
that we have to put into the calculus

43:20.040 --> 43:22.880
of being able to make things here.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.440
There's an extremely high cost

43:24.440 --> 43:26.160
to making supply chain resilient

43:26.160 --> 43:27.840
that we really have to consider.

43:27.840 --> 43:31.480
And so if you really consider that cost,

43:31.480 --> 43:33.080
it makes a lot of sense to invest,

43:33.080 --> 43:36.520
especially long-term in building up manufacturing

43:36.560 --> 43:39.000
in a way where like you're making most of the stuff

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
in one place, sort of bringing it all,

43:44.480 --> 43:47.040
not all, but as much in as possible

43:47.040 --> 43:49.880
and building it almost like from scratch

43:49.880 --> 43:50.880
here in the United States.

43:50.880 --> 43:55.880
I mean, what I guess your thought is with innovation

43:57.560 --> 43:59.680
it's possible to sort of revolutionize

43:59.680 --> 44:00.960
the way we do manufacturing.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.600
So reduce the amount of supply chain stuff

44:03.600 --> 44:05.280
and like build stuff from scratch.

44:05.280 --> 44:08.800
Like do high-tech manufacturing.

44:08.800 --> 44:11.760
So like optimize all aspects of the manufacturing

44:11.760 --> 44:13.680
and all that kind of stuff.

44:13.680 --> 44:18.680
Yeah, and I think where technology is the most efficient

44:20.000 --> 44:23.840
is the human machine interface, right?

44:23.840 --> 44:25.520
It's not let's automate everything

44:25.520 --> 44:27.080
and have nobody work anywhere.

44:27.080 --> 44:32.080
I, for a long time, that's neither feasible nor desirable

44:32.400 --> 44:35.640
but where we can enhance jobs

44:37.400 --> 44:41.400
and make that interface immensely productive

44:42.360 --> 44:43.920
with the right training and so forth.

44:43.920 --> 44:46.280
I think that's a worthwhile endeavor

44:46.280 --> 44:49.240
and something that's gonna be important to our country.

44:49.240 --> 44:52.920
Yeah, I mean, you're, you know who you're talking to.

44:52.920 --> 44:55.920
I love human robot interaction, human machine interaction,

44:55.920 --> 44:57.280
human AI interaction.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.120
So what do you think is the role of robotics

44:59.120 --> 45:01.320
in this high-tech manufacturing?

45:02.120 --> 45:04.400
Sort of like industrial robots, robotic arms,

45:04.400 --> 45:06.440
all that kind of stuff

45:06.440 --> 45:09.400
or even more complicated kind of robots.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.680
What do you think is the role of robotics?

45:11.680 --> 45:13.240
What do you think is the role of AI

45:13.240 --> 45:16.240
in this manufacturing future you're thinking about?

45:16.240 --> 45:20.400
Well, robotics to me is an extremely exciting field.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.080
I don't have the same expertise that you do.

45:23.080 --> 45:26.040
I have an adjacency but not the depth of knowledge.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.200
Have never really delved deeply into it

45:29.200 --> 45:30.440
or made investments in it.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.520
But I think what's exciting about it

45:32.520 --> 45:35.000
is everything from doing jobs

45:35.000 --> 45:37.440
that are very dangerous for humans,

45:38.760 --> 45:41.600
enhancing the human experience.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.920
When you look at really repetitive labor,

45:44.920 --> 45:49.120
things that, you know, it might take away a job,

45:49.120 --> 45:51.600
but is it a good job for that person?

45:51.600 --> 45:53.320
Is, you know, spending 30 years

45:53.320 --> 45:55.160
doing something highly repetitious,

45:55.160 --> 45:59.000
is that a good experience in life?

45:59.000 --> 46:02.520
So I think, and then when you think about everything

46:02.520 --> 46:06.960
from military applications, you know, rescue,

46:06.960 --> 46:09.000
we're already seeing a bunch of those things.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.640
And then just lastly,

46:11.640 --> 46:15.160
when you talk about that human interaction with robots,

46:15.160 --> 46:17.960
when you start to have the combination,

46:17.960 --> 46:22.200
so you have some level of intelligence and interaction,

46:22.200 --> 46:25.720
I mean, that's why we always love the droids

46:25.720 --> 46:26.760
in Star Wars, right?

46:26.800 --> 46:30.200
I mean, it's exciting.

46:30.200 --> 46:31.840
It captures the imagination.

46:33.800 --> 46:37.640
And I think, look, many, many hours

46:37.640 --> 46:42.640
have been spent on debating artificial intelligence

46:42.760 --> 46:47.120
and the ramifications if things go sideways and so forth.

46:48.120 --> 46:50.560
And I think those are all, you know,

46:50.560 --> 46:54.160
those are appropriate conversations to be having.

46:54.160 --> 46:56.240
AI is happening.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.960
I think it's actually happening slower

46:57.960 --> 46:59.480
than most people realize,

47:01.600 --> 47:04.560
because there are tasks that humans do

47:04.560 --> 47:06.720
every minute of every day,

47:06.720 --> 47:09.640
standing up without losing your sense of balance.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.840
I mean, these are really hard things,

47:12.840 --> 47:16.640
but I think there's enough investment,

47:16.640 --> 47:19.840
both in private industry as well as nation states now

47:19.840 --> 47:22.640
on artificial intelligence that it is coming.

47:23.560 --> 47:27.320
So both in the software space, in the digital space,

47:27.320 --> 47:29.120
and in the physical space,

47:29.120 --> 47:32.600
so we talk about manufacturing, so industrial robotics,

47:32.600 --> 47:35.040
is very true that even in the factory,

47:35.040 --> 47:38.040
even the tasks that you think are pretty basic,

47:40.560 --> 47:44.320
you know, the amount of small intuitive decisions

47:44.320 --> 47:46.520
that humans make is quite incredible.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.760
So we have to be kind of explicit about saying

47:49.760 --> 47:52.160
which tasks are actually really hard

47:52.600 --> 47:54.680
and humans are just really good at them.

47:54.680 --> 47:59.680
And so on the flip side, in the digital space,

47:59.760 --> 48:01.640
with social networks, we recommend our systems,

48:01.640 --> 48:04.760
with all kinds of like personal assistance

48:04.760 --> 48:09.760
in terms of voice-based AI systems, all of that.

48:10.320 --> 48:13.160
There's opportunities there to find niches

48:13.160 --> 48:17.280
where AI can really have a transformative effect.

48:17.280 --> 48:22.280
I think one of the places that really haven't...

48:25.080 --> 48:27.440
This is where, like, you're worried to say stupid things,

48:27.440 --> 48:29.400
but I believe this very much,

48:29.400 --> 48:33.160
that when we have AI systems in the home currently,

48:33.160 --> 48:36.480
you have somebody like Alexa and Google Home and so on.

48:36.480 --> 48:40.840
They're kind of very basic servants.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.240
They tell you about the weather, they can play some music,

48:43.240 --> 48:45.080
they can turn the lights on and off,

48:45.080 --> 48:47.680
all that kind of like smart home stuff.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.440
I think there's a lot of value in systems

48:51.440 --> 48:56.320
that form relationships with us in the way that pets do.

48:56.320 --> 49:00.000
Dogs and cats, I don't know, cats,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.560
just for people who have cats, cats don't care about you.

49:02.560 --> 49:03.560
They really don't.

49:03.560 --> 49:05.200
They don't form any kind of relationship.

49:05.200 --> 49:07.120
I don't know why you have a relationship with them.

49:07.120 --> 49:08.320
It's one way.

49:08.320 --> 49:12.000
Anyway, sorry, I threw out some shade.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.240
I'm just kidding, by the way.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.760
That's a basic kind of connection

49:15.440 --> 49:16.960
that we have with another living being.

49:16.960 --> 49:18.440
Then there's also just friends.

49:18.440 --> 49:20.680
You have different levels of friends, acquaintances,

49:20.680 --> 49:23.240
you have lifelong friends, all that.

49:23.240 --> 49:25.280
That friendship you have,

49:25.280 --> 49:27.880
I really believe that there is some aspect

49:27.880 --> 49:32.600
of the human experience that is deeply enriched

49:32.600 --> 49:35.400
by interacting with other beings.

49:35.400 --> 49:40.320
And for systems, computing systems,

49:40.320 --> 49:43.080
artificial intelligence systems in our world,

49:44.080 --> 49:46.800
to have the capability to engage in some of that,

49:46.800 --> 49:48.880
I think is not just an opportunity

49:48.880 --> 49:53.440
to help people grow, become better people,

49:53.440 --> 49:55.960
but it's also just a good business opportunity too.

49:55.960 --> 49:58.400
And that hasn't really been explored enough.

49:58.400 --> 50:02.120
So that to me is really, that's a whole exciting space

50:02.120 --> 50:07.120
that I think will enable better industrial robotics.

50:08.480 --> 50:11.320
It will empower a better Facebook

50:11.480 --> 50:13.120
or a better social network,

50:13.120 --> 50:15.760
a competitive Facebook that overthrows Facebook.

50:15.760 --> 50:19.680
So it'll create better technologies

50:19.680 --> 50:24.320
that currently don't have that human robot interaction touch.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.400
So I don't know.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.720
That's super exciting to me,

50:27.720 --> 50:32.720
but that has to deal with the mess of human nature.

50:34.400 --> 50:37.800
The reason that most robotics people and AI people

50:37.800 --> 50:39.280
stay away from humans,

50:40.240 --> 50:43.880
they stay away from the human robot interaction problem

50:43.880 --> 50:46.320
is because humans are complicated.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.440
They're messy.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.160
They're hard to control.

50:49.160 --> 50:54.160
They're hard to predict stuff about.

50:54.400 --> 50:58.680
They're hard to make sense of or like test repeatedly

50:58.680 --> 51:01.840
because one human can be drastically different

51:01.840 --> 51:02.960
from another human.

51:02.960 --> 51:05.200
And so to deal with that as a robotics problem

51:05.200 --> 51:06.120
is super hard.

51:07.120 --> 51:11.800
And so one of the questions is which problems

51:11.800 --> 51:14.120
can you remove the human from consideration

51:14.120 --> 51:15.600
when you're trying to solve the problem?

51:15.600 --> 51:17.360
So Elon Musk is an example,

51:17.360 --> 51:20.560
somebody who believes autonomous driving,

51:20.560 --> 51:23.200
we can remove the human from consideration.

51:23.200 --> 51:26.480
We could solve autonomous driving as a robotics problem.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.400
It's stay in the lane.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.560
When there's a red light, you stop at a red light.

51:31.560 --> 51:34.600
If there are humans in the picture like pedestrians,

51:34.600 --> 51:36.560
that's a ballistics problem.

51:36.560 --> 51:39.600
It's just treat them as a moving object

51:39.600 --> 51:42.680
that has with like 90% probability,

51:42.680 --> 51:45.880
keeps moving in the way they were in the past few seconds

51:45.880 --> 51:48.840
with some smaller probability that might stop or turn.

51:48.840 --> 51:51.520
Like just do some basic models about them

51:51.520 --> 51:53.280
and you'll be able to do just fine.

51:53.280 --> 51:57.160
So I tend to believe that even driving

51:58.080 --> 52:01.080
has to consider the full messiness of humans.

52:01.080 --> 52:03.920
The dance, the game theoretic dance of chicken

52:03.920 --> 52:07.480
that we all do when we jaywalk,

52:07.480 --> 52:10.120
we look at the car, that car doesn't,

52:10.120 --> 52:12.120
that driver doesn't have the guts to murder me.

52:12.120 --> 52:14.600
So I'm going to walk in front of it and not look at the car.

52:14.600 --> 52:17.560
We do that kind of dance and AI systems

52:17.560 --> 52:22.120
need to be able to do that kind of dance.

52:24.200 --> 52:28.520
In Talco, there's the labs.

52:28.520 --> 52:32.320
So there's a data science component, it's an AI component.

52:32.320 --> 52:35.840
So how do they go into a company

52:35.840 --> 52:38.120
and help revolutionize that industry?

52:38.120 --> 52:39.880
Well, there's different examples.

52:39.880 --> 52:44.880
So one of our companies FIGS makes healthcare workwear

52:45.040 --> 52:47.640
started by these two brilliant women

52:47.640 --> 52:52.640
and early days helping to build the platform and recruit

52:54.440 --> 52:59.440
and make sure that everything that we did at the company

53:00.440 --> 53:03.360
embraced technology.

53:03.360 --> 53:06.040
And at the same time, they were obsessive

53:06.040 --> 53:09.960
about their customer, which is doctors, nurses,

53:09.960 --> 53:12.600
healthcare workers who are putting it on the line every day

53:12.600 --> 53:14.120
and obsessive about their product.

53:14.120 --> 53:17.320
And when you have those two things come together,

53:17.320 --> 53:22.320
you get the result that we did at FIGS.

53:24.680 --> 53:26.760
We have a company called Acasher,

53:26.760 --> 53:31.560
which it's AI lab and base is down here in Austin, Texas.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.760
It was an insurance,

53:33.760 --> 53:36.720
one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.

53:36.720 --> 53:41.720
And we did a deal with them and sold some of our

53:43.040 --> 53:46.560
our insurance holdings, it was completely AI driven.

53:47.880 --> 53:50.800
And in that case, you basically put the team

53:50.800 --> 53:52.800
inside the company, right?

53:52.800 --> 53:56.240
Because it's a massive company with all

53:56.240 --> 53:58.200
and we've gone into all kinds of things.

53:59.920 --> 54:03.920
So it just depends on the different situations.

54:03.920 --> 54:06.680
But the biggest thing was just to make sure

54:06.680 --> 54:11.680
whatever the company needed, they had access to the talent.

54:11.920 --> 54:15.480
Sometimes we'd build it, sometimes we'd help recruit for it.

54:15.480 --> 54:18.520
You know how in technology, it's whatever works, right?

54:18.520 --> 54:22.240
There's no one way to do things.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.800
Well Acasher is really interesting as an example.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.640
So insurance is a fascinating space.

54:27.640 --> 54:30.400
It seems like very ripe still

54:30.400 --> 54:32.680
for disruption across the board.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.640
So how do you, it seems like a lot of the disruption

54:35.640 --> 54:40.640
has to do with like almost the first dump step

54:42.080 --> 54:47.080
of we've been using mostly paper, like it's not digitized.

54:47.920 --> 54:49.920
You have to basically convert,

54:49.920 --> 54:52.200
create a infrastructure and a framework

54:52.200 --> 54:55.400
where like everybody is using the same digital system.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.040
Like databases and just organize the data.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.320
It seems like that's a huge leap

55:01.320 --> 55:04.000
that basically can revolutionize major industries

55:04.000 --> 55:05.480
that still hasn't been done.

55:05.480 --> 55:08.040
Insurance is obviously the great example of that.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.800
And one of the things that struck me,

55:10.800 --> 55:14.080
the founder CEO of Acasher is a guy named Greg Williams.

55:14.080 --> 55:16.160
They're out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.520
And as we were looking at expanding our footprint

55:18.520 --> 55:22.280
in insurance, I met with a lot of insurance executives

55:22.280 --> 55:24.360
and they would talk about technology.

55:24.360 --> 55:29.360
But Greg truly understood the power of what would happen

55:29.920 --> 55:34.920
across actuarial sciences, predictive analytics

55:35.200 --> 55:37.280
and using machine learning

55:37.280 --> 55:39.560
to really run every aspect of your business.

55:39.560 --> 55:42.440
And then automating a lot of the,

55:42.440 --> 55:45.560
just the back office tedious steps.

55:45.560 --> 55:48.720
And as you said, one of the things that was great for us,

55:48.720 --> 55:53.720
they already had a data collection system and department

55:54.560 --> 55:57.040
so it was much easier to pivot.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
And I'm very excited about the future of that company.

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
It's, they're doing some pretty innovative,

56:06.240 --> 56:07.440
groundbreaking things.

56:07.440 --> 56:11.040
And those are the things that I like doing, right?

56:11.040 --> 56:15.360
Is that, yes, I wanna make money.

56:15.360 --> 56:17.320
Just, that's what that is.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.000
But at the same time,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.600
what did you do with your time on earth, right?

56:21.600 --> 56:24.360
Did you do anything to leave any kind of mark

56:24.360 --> 56:27.680
that you did anything interesting?

56:27.680 --> 56:29.480
I can only speak for myself.

56:29.480 --> 56:33.400
There are many more ways to measure one's life

56:33.400 --> 56:36.640
and I can only speak about how I think about things.

56:37.920 --> 56:41.320
I grew up poor in upstate New York with a single mom

56:41.320 --> 56:46.080
and watched her work a couple of jobs and had to,

56:46.080 --> 56:49.680
from a young age, shovel snow and mow lawns

56:49.680 --> 56:52.600
and do all kinds of things to help her make sure

56:52.600 --> 56:55.320
the lights weren't turned off in our little place.

56:55.320 --> 56:57.360
And so that's just something

56:57.360 --> 57:00.240
that I've always been driven towards.

57:00.240 --> 57:05.240
And I have really eclectic tastes and interests

57:07.120 --> 57:11.320
and it's just been an interesting journey.

57:11.320 --> 57:14.800
So help be part of and help enable

57:14.840 --> 57:19.840
some cool new creations across the board.

57:19.920 --> 57:24.920
Like film, music, AI, manufacturing,

57:26.600 --> 57:31.200
just insurance, all the specific industries

57:31.200 --> 57:33.240
that you disrupted, yeah.

57:33.240 --> 57:38.240
Small tangent, back to your childhood with your mom.

57:39.280 --> 57:42.720
Any memories kind of stand out,

57:42.720 --> 57:47.320
stick with you as something that helped define

57:47.320 --> 57:49.200
who you are as a man?

57:49.200 --> 57:53.320
Yeah, even though the university and college experience

57:53.320 --> 57:55.920
was not part of the family tree

57:58.160 --> 58:01.520
and we had no connections, I didn't understand,

58:01.520 --> 58:03.840
I didn't know what a trust fund was or prep school.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.600
I didn't know what any of that was.

58:07.080 --> 58:11.160
But my mom from a young age would always say,

58:11.160 --> 58:12.200
you're gonna go to college.

58:12.200 --> 58:15.360
There's no, if you choose to.

58:15.360 --> 58:17.000
And I think from a young age,

58:17.000 --> 58:21.080
that was just an expectation that I had

58:21.080 --> 58:23.280
and that she instilled and the work ethic.

58:23.280 --> 58:28.280
I watched her and then my grandmother was a janitor,

58:28.960 --> 58:31.840
a cleaning lady in a hospital for 50 years.

58:31.840 --> 58:36.440
And then I remember there were times of,

58:36.440 --> 58:39.520
I'm probably 10 years old, it's freezing cold out.

58:39.520 --> 58:42.880
And if I don't go out and shovel six driveways,

58:42.880 --> 58:45.080
we don't have enough money to pay the bill.

58:45.080 --> 58:48.480
So I don't know, I'm not a psychologist,

58:48.480 --> 58:52.880
so I don't know how that manifests itself in my life today.

58:52.880 --> 58:57.880
But I think the grit to say,

58:57.960 --> 59:01.640
I'm not in the mood to do this, I don't wanna do this,

59:01.640 --> 59:04.480
but that's the work that needs to be done.

59:04.480 --> 59:08.480
And no excuses, not I'm a victim

59:08.480 --> 59:10.240
and I'm gonna sit around and talk about,

59:10.240 --> 59:13.360
no, it is what it is and you have to get done

59:13.360 --> 59:15.000
what you need to get done.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.160
And again, I think it's,

59:19.240 --> 59:21.280
you can never fully put yourself

59:21.280 --> 59:23.560
in someone else's shoes or experience,

59:23.560 --> 59:25.440
because I don't know what that is or feels like.

59:25.440 --> 59:29.800
But for me, those were two, I think, formative things

59:31.800 --> 59:33.800
that were important in my childhood.

59:33.800 --> 59:37.000
So that's pretty, the reality of life like that

59:37.000 --> 59:38.360
is pretty humbling.

59:39.360 --> 59:41.800
You've been so exceptionally successful

59:41.800 --> 59:45.120
that it's easy to get soft now.

59:45.120 --> 59:49.240
How do you get humble these days?

59:49.240 --> 59:50.200
By getting up.

59:51.320 --> 59:56.320
I think for me personally, trying to push the envelope

59:57.400 --> 59:59.280
and being weighed and measured,

59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.720
that's why I always loved sports too,

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.320
there's a scoreboard.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.320
And I'm a huge believer in opportunity, meritocracy,

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.560
all those things that I think are ideals

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.720
that we wanna aspire to.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.280
And I think that there's a lot of things

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.600
I'm involved with right now

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.200
that I just wanna see if I can do it.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:27.200
I wanna see if, and my own little mantra

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.160
is cause the outcome, as much as you can.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.720
And at the same time, have the humility

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.880
and not to have the hubris or arrogance to say,

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.960
I'm always gonna cause the outcome

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.760
because you'll get your ass kicked pretty quickly

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.080
and humbled.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.200
The world and the universe is a big place

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.680
with forces beyond.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.600
But I think, I also think a lot

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.200
about being intellectually honest,

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.560
which when I do university talks and so forth,

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.720
I think that's a superpower

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.600
because if you find yourself making decisions

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.080
based on other people's expectations,

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.320
based on places you don't wanna go,

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:18.320
but you feel like momentum is taking you there,

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.200
I think that's a big problem.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.000
And there are people that go to our top universities

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.600
and can't wait to get out and start their own company

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:35.160
and they want that pressure and they want to grind.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.560
And there are other people that are smart and talented,

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.080
but just say, look, I don't wanna lay awake

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.680
staring at the ceiling wondering how I'm gonna make payroll.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.480
I don't want that in my life.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.600
And I think if you can square that up

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.240
and be okay with it and say, what makes me tick?

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.800
What makes me happy?

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.680
What puts me in a bad head space?

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.920
Cause there's a difference between challenging yourself

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.080
and going against your nature.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.000
So that's why I think that being intellectually honest

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.320
and being able to really sit down

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.840
and go inside your own head and say, what am I good at?

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.480
What am I not good at?

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.760
How am I gonna put myself in a position to be successful

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.440
because I'm working on my weaknesses,

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.840
but I'm not gonna put myself career-wise in a position

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.840
where I'm just fundamentally gonna have a hard time

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:25.840
being successful.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.120
Yeah, intellectually honest is a tricky one.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.320
And it gets, there's like levels to it too.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.160
Sure.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.240
Well, some of the things I think about

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.240
when you dream of doing certain kinds of big things,

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.560
a part of intellectual honesty is to say several things.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.320
One is like, hey, the thing you're dreaming about,

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:02.960
one, the fact that nobody's done it

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.960
probably shows that you're just a dreamer.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.080
This is not going to, like think clearly.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.200
The fact that it hasn't been done probably shows

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.480
that it may not be the right path.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.680
And two is like, if you're dreaming about stuff,

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.720
there's a certain point where it's like,

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.840
hey, you haven't done it.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.760
Like, why haven't you done it already then?

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.200
Like, you have to be honest with yourself.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.600
You have to be ambitious.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:35.600
Like, a lot of people work hard a long time for a dream,

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.920
but you have to wake up and be like, all right,

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.000
I've been at this for 10 years.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.600
Like with a startup, you launch a startup and you think,

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.840
okay, one year, two years, three years, four years,

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.000
pretty successful, but it hasn't exploded.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.120
Like you dreamed and you have to shut it down.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.000
You have to be intellectually honest there.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
At the same time, you might want to be like step it up,

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:07.080
lean into it, say almost like the flip side

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.480
of like intellectual honesty is like maddening ambition

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.920
of just saying, fuck it, I'm going to go all in.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.800
But that is a kind of intellectual honesty saying like,

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.120
you know, the big problem here is I've been kind of going,

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.400
doing too many things.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.920
Maybe with this dream, you have to go all in on it,

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:30.760
all those kinds of things.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.200
I mean, this is human experience, it's complicated.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:37.560
Yes, all human things are complicated.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.680
And I think there's a difference between being reckless

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.960
and making well-thought out informed decisions.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.320
If you're going to go all in, make sure you've, you know,

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.880
measure twice, cut once, as they say.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.760
And one of my other favorite, I forget, many years ago,

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.400
I heard this saying and it stayed with me.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:02.400
It was never mistake clear line of sight with distance.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.480
And you know that, so I think that the key,

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.760
whether you're starting a business or you're thinking

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.240
about leaving the company you're at and starting a business

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.320
or just leaving for another job,

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.200
any of these things is as much as you can, right?

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.120
And psychologists, I think, would tell us it's hard

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.320
to be self-aware completely, right?

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.560
That's the rub, that if we were all completely self-aware

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.360
of everything that we did in strength and weaknesses,

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.320
it'd be a different world.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.480
But I do think you can work on that

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.360
and at least challenge yourself to think about it

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.760
and not be in a position where I'm, you know,

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.960
I'm going to medical school

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.600
because that's what you do in my family.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.440
And even though I'm miserable doing it,

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.640
you know, things like that.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.680
So definitely you don't want to be sort of,

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:59.680
because you don't think fall victim to conformity.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.200
They just go on doing the same thing over and over.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.040
That's right.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.600
But at the same time,

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.640
is measure twice and cut once.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.480
It does feel like some of the biggest leaps taken

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.280
or where you cut once and measure later

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.200
is you leap in first.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.040
Sure.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.040
It's almost like a gut.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.360
I suppose that is a measurement,

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:32.320
but you build up a good gut instinct of like what to do

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.280
and then you just do it and then you figure out as,

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.920
it's the building the airplane as you're flying it.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.040
Right.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.880
Well, and I think each one of those instances

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.040
that you could probably cite

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.760
has its own unique circumstances, right?

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.360
I don't have a deep biotech background.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.920
So if I suddenly stood up and said,

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.080
I'm going to put everything I have into this idea,

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.600
well, that's, you know, those are, right?

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.840
It's game theory, right?

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:01.880
What are the odds of success?

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.880
If on the other hand, you know,

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.800
you're brilliant in your field

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.760
or you've seen some opportunity

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.040
that you think is wide open

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.120
and you're going to go for it and break stuff,

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.120
that's great.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.120
You just want to wait, to me always say like,

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.680
how crazy is this on the spectrum of, you know,

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.800
do I have any expertise?

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.640
What is the downside if I fail?

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.000
Right?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.280
You know, if you're at a certain point in life

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.760
with young children and you've got a mortgage

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.080
and whatever else, that is one circumstance

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.280
versus I just got out of Stanford

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.720
or I just got out of whatever and I'm going to go for it.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.480
It's just the whole thing, right?

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.880
It is complex as you point out.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.760
And sometimes you just want to have the right matrix

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.440
in your head of decision-making process

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.640
to try to arrive at the right place.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.680
And even if you get close, that's where I think you say,

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.600
you know what, the hell with it.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.560
I'm doing this.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.840
Yeah.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.080
Yeah.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.560
I do want to ask you about one specific idea

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.600
that sounds super fascinating

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:13.880
that you're involved with recently.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.240
You led the $50 million seed round

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.320
for a company called Colossal

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.320
that is focused on de-extinction.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.520
This is funny relative to our connection

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.480
and conversation about Jurassic World.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.920
They're seeking to restore lost ecosystems

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.640
and use gene editing to restore the woolly mammoth

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.280
to the Arctic tundra.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.640
How are they going to do that?

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.360
Well, I met this fascinating guy at Harvard

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.240
named George Church five, six years ago

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.800
and found him to be incredibly smart,

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.600
have an imagination.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.840
And he partnered up with a guy named Ben Lamb,

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.120
who's an entrepreneur.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.520
And basically the press and to me,

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.000
the imaginative, like you're capturing my imagination

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
by telling me you're going to bring back the woolly mammoth

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.600
and other extinct animals.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.720
And I, you know, we'll see where that road leads.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.240
I was more interested in an investor

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.480
in the things that they're working through

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.080
around understanding genes in proteins

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.840
and CRISPR and all these other things,

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:36.840
because being adjacent to George Church and his team,

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.080
as these things unfold over the next decade,

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.840
I thought was the right thing to do.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.160
So people are important here,

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.200
just like investing in people

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.120
and seeing what the hell they come up with.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:48.960
Absolutely.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.440
I mean, you can look through history

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.440
and great things are done by great people, right?

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.360
And companies, they end up over time becoming a logo

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.840
and immediately what you think of them,

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.360
but they started out with a person, with an idea,

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.320
and a team that cultivated that and made that happen.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.560
And I think there are certain folks

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.240
that are just immensely talented,

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.840
that if you can be around them,

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.960
and I also know his and his team's ethics

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:28.680
in terms of, you know, after spending time

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.400
talking about where the lines are,

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.040
people in other countries that, you know,

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.480
may not have the same process,

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.760
may not have the same checks and balances,

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.480
are doing this and pursuing this regardless.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:46.280
So at least I felt like with George and Ben and their teams,

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.280
they're also very responsible people.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.560
This is where the human side of things comes into play.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.960
I've interacted with a lot of really brilliant people

01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.000
in the technology space where you kind of, you know,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.600
there's a lot of ways to feel this out.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.920
You can ask them whether they kind of read literature.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.920
You can feel out how much they really understand

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.280
about like human nature here.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.800
Like whatever the technology is,

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:17.840
when it actually starts to play,

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.160
interact with society at scale,

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.560
like do they have an understanding or an intuition

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.440
about how that happens?

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.240
Some of that requires studying history.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.480
Some of that requires like just looking at the worst

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.360
and best parts and events in human history

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.840
to understand like, hey, it doesn't always turn out

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.840
like everybody hoped the technology turns out.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.400
And if a person has a depth of understanding about history,

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:52.360
about human nature, then I think that's the right person

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.560
to mess with some of this cutting edge stuff.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.840
You want Marcus Aurelius with a PhD from MIT.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.280
Exactly, exactly.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.480
Just small tangent, but you mentioned having a conversation

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.360
with Warren Buffett, you spoke really highly of him

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.520
as an investor, as a human being.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.040
What about him do you admire?

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.160
What insights have you drawn from him

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.720
as a great investor yourself?

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.240
Well, the afternoon that I got to spend with him,

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.920
something I'll treasure forever.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.280
Look, sometimes when you meet people,

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.360
even that are immensely successful,

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.360
you may decide that after 20 minutes or a half hour,

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.320
oh, you were in the right place at the right time

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.760
and that's fine.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.080
There are other people that are clearly different,

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.000
special, and I don't care if you've made them start

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
from zero, would end up in a good place.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.600
And so it was an absolute privilege

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.040
to spend the time with him.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.360
And a couple of things that stood out in the conversation,

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.880
he is incredibly intellectually curious and well-read.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.840
And I like how simplistic he likes

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:18.000
to keep his thought matrix.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.120
And then also, instead of trying to outsmart the market,

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.720
it seems like a simple axiom, but just look,

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:30.160
good companies that are led by talented managers

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.120
that are good businesses over time are gonna get there.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.880
So I'm not gonna day trade, I'm just gonna,

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.440
I'm looking for value.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.920
And then just on life stuff, he just,

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.000
and also his ability to take in

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000
and then use information was incredibly impressive.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.280
So I only spent the, I'd met him before,

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.200
but I only spent one afternoon with him,

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.680
but it's pretty incredible.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.120
And one of the things that stuck out to me

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.240
is we were in the middle of talking about Talco or investing

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.800
or how we thought about it.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:14.520
And I said, I'm trying to be smart about,

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.760
and he stopped me and he said, Charlie Munger,

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.040
his partner of many years,

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.000
Charlie and I don't try to think of the smart thing to do.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.640
We try to think what's the dumb thing we could do here.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.040
And I kind of laughed and he said, no, I'm dead serious.

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.840
We think about it from the standpoint of

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.680
what could we do in this situation

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.720
that later we would be like,

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.600
that was a really dumb thing to do.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.840
And I actually thought that was,

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.480
it got in my head and I still think a lot about that

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.720
as I'm dissecting problems.

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.560
So there is, like, that's a kind of long-term thinking

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.120
if you just avoid the dumb things,

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:58.880
or if you simplify, just focus on those simple steps,

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.760
all it takes is just do that for a long period of time

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.680
and you'll be successful.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.880
It certainly worked for him, that's all I can say.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.240
What about you?

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.680
You've been a great investor yourself.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.280
How do you know, when you judge people,

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.160
so I, whenever I go to San Francisco,

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.960
I was thinking of moving to San Francisco.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.160
That's why I decided to,

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.480
after really giving it some thought,

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.800
talking to people, decided to move to Austin.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.680
Everybody's dreaming big and they have big plans

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.920
and it's actually, I don't envy the job of an investor

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:42.200
of any kind because everybody has big dreams

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.160
and it's hard to know who exactly,

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.400
what idea is going to materialize,

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:51.720
what team is going to materialize into something great.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:55.160
How do you make those decisions about people, about ideas?

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.920
Well, if I had any kind of a lattice work on this,

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.840
it absolutely starts with the people

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.760
and I think the reason for that is,

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.360
your business plan is going to change.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.320
There's very few businesses I know of that say,

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.040
we're gonna make a widget in this location

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:18.440
and 30 years later, we're successful

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.040
and we just make a widget and that's what it is.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.000
Things happen and today they happen with such velocity

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000
that you have to be able to make hard decisions

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.640
based on imperfect information and are you,

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.680
how are you going to calculate those answers?

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.760
How self-interested are you going to be?

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.920
What kind of ethics will you apply?

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:47.480
What's your short-term versus long-term thinking?

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:52.120
Are you able to give an honest assessment of a situation?

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.800
Because the thing that you can count on

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.440
is problems are gonna happen,

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.600
things you didn't anticipate are gonna happen.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.000
How pliable are you, right?

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
How much elasticity is there in your ability

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.600
to be successful?

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:15.200
And I think it's important when you invest in something

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.000
that you both see, you understand the roadmap ahead

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.680
and agree to it, right?

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.440
Doesn't mean there won't be twists and turns

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.040
but you're not like, whoa, wait a minute,

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.240
what did we do here?

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:29.560
This isn't what was in the thing I signed up for.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:34.920
And then I think honesty and communication

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.680
is a huge thing to me with,

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:42.360
I always tell people if bi-directionally,

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.800
if there's something going on,

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.360
start the conversation with Lex, we have a problem.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.160
Okay, now I'm sitting up, you have my full attention,

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.160
we're gonna talk about whatever it is.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.840
Bad news should travel faster than good news.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:01.320
And because it's going to happen,

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.480
being in business with someone

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:06.080
that is gonna shoot you straight

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.880
and sometimes say, I don't know,

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:10.920
I don't know what the answer is,

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.520
I gotta go figure it out,

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:15.920
that I can process a lot better than,

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.440
look, I don't want you mad at me or disappointed

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.920
or I can't handle not having success,

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.040
so we're just gonna kick the can

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.960
and I think especially in today's business environment,

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.840
that's very, very dangerous.

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.240
So that's a bad sign,

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.760
not just because it's good to communicate and be honest,

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.800
but if they're not willing to do that,

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.280
then it goes back to the intellectual honesty.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.760
They're probably not also able to be brutally honest

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.400
with themselves when they look in the mirror

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.400
about the direction of the company.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.240
But look, I wasn't there, so I don't know,

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:57.800
but I think if you unpack many situations

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.040
that turned out negatively,

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.720
most of the people, whether you're faking lab results,

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.600
you have a biotech company,

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.440
everybody's staring at Theranos these days.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.680
Do I think in a lot of cases,

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.200
you're either the villain,

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.840
like you started out saying,

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.080
I'm gonna screw my shareholders over

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.400
and I'm gonna be a liar.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.760
That isn't my experience.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.960
Most things are little incremental moves that you say,

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.480
we're gonna get this right next week,

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:29.160
but today we gotta make the presentation,

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.680
so we're gonna just tweak things a little bit.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.160
That's a slippery slope, right?

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:38.640
And so that's why I think from a standpoint of people,

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:44.640
you wanna go into the foxhole with folks that understand

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.560
things are gonna happen and I'm gonna let you know

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:53.000
about them and we're gonna try to solve them together.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.400
And then just in terms of the idea,

01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:00.400
I always ask like, okay, if this company executed the way,

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.880
that's the other thing that always cracks me up

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.160
about financials.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.040
Whenever somebody pitches you,

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.200
inevitably they'll say,

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.960
our projections are really, really conservative.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.840
I'm still waiting for somebody to come in and say,

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.480
look, my projections are wildly optimistic.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.240
We'll never hit these numbers, but anyway.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.800
If this company did what it says and executes,

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.720
does it matter?

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.280
Does it move the needle enough?

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.280
And what are the things that uniquely position this company

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.240
to be successful?

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.480
And you just have to be able to answer, I think,

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:39.120
a number of those questions pretty crisply.

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.680
But at the end of the day, it's still a big risk.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:44.520
So you're just trying to minimize the risk.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.240
Let me jump to another topic.

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.040
You're an incredible human being

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.360
that you're involved with this.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:59.360
Your band, Ghost Hounds, is touring with the Rolling Stones.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.560
So before we talk about your band, let me ask about that.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:07.120
What's that like, playing with the Rolling Stones?

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:08.480
Surreal.

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:12.360
Just because they're my favorite band of all time.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.280
To me, the greatest rock and roll band,

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.040
it's not even close, of all time.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:24.040
And to share the same stage, to be on tour

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.680
and to go out and get that energy from the crowd.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.280
And every night and come off stage and later when they go on

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.560
and you hear that iconic, ladies and gentlemen,

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:36.680
the Rolling Stones.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:38.480
It's incredible.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.320
And what's amazing to me about the band,

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:47.080
next year will be their 60th anniversary, 60 years.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.960
And it's hard to be around anything for that long,

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.440
but making music and packing stadiums.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.600
And what's amazing to me, they can play a two hour set.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.360
And it's not just that, oh, that's a hit,

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.960
or you recognize it.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.560
It's like every song is an anthem.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.760
So it's been amazing.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.720
We got to play with them in 2019

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.640
and when they ask us to do this again,

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.800
it's just an absolute privilege.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:21.560
I asked you the soft line,

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.720
so I know you are a kind of rock star.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.560
But just me, maybe I'm projecting,

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.800
but do you get nervous, such a large audience

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.720
with the Rolling Stones?

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.000
It feels like there would be a lot of pressure.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.480
Yeah, I mean, you definitely don't wanna screw it up.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:44.480
I think the band, our band is tight knit

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.640
and all that stuff.

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:50.640
And I think that you, the individual nervousness dissipates

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.360
when you go out as a group and you're making music together

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.200
and you sort of, okay, we're all in this

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.440
and we're doing a thing.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.640
Which is why, even in sports,

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.720
I always look at individual events like ice skating

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:09.040
or anything where it's just you out there alone.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.200
And that's different than being with a team

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:13.040
and nerve wracking.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:16.880
So I'm sure if it was me with an acoustic guitar

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.920
just going out, it would feel different.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.720
But absolutely you get the right kind of butterflies,

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:23.600
I would call it.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.040
And just the energy of playing music

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:31.280
and having it be this relationship.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.040
And look, I get it.

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.040
I've been to a ton of concerts where I'm like,

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.640
look, can we just get to the band please?

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.440
But what's been great is just an amazing reception.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.480
And we have this guy named Trey Nation

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.960
is the lead singer who's just incredibly talented.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:54.200
I mean, he's just not only an amazing voice

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.480
but just has that charismatic thing.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.920
Yeah, he's great.

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:58.760
It's fun.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:02.800
What's it feel like to play in front of a huge audience?

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.120
As a guitarist, what's the feel?

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.600
Are you lost in the music?

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.640
You almost don't feel the audience.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.360
Does it add extra energy?

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.360
Does it add extra anxiety?

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.360
What does it feel like?

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.520
You know, stadiums are interesting

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.400
just because it's so big and cavernous

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:24.640
and because you wanna protect your ears.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.280
So we use an in-ear system

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.620
so that you are a little disconnected from the crowd

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:32.200
because if you're playing that loud

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.400
and you're standing in front of your amps

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.480
without ear protection, that's bad.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.200
How are you monitoring the sound?

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.560
The in-ear stuff, is that producing sound

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.960
or is it strictly earplugs?

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.200
No, it's producing the sound.

01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:46.480
So it's like putting ear pods in

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.880
and listening to a song and you're playing to it, right?

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.480
It's just us playing, but it protects your ears.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.080
But the energy from the crowd,

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.660
when they get going and get into it,

01:25:00.660 --> 01:25:03.380
which knock on wood so far has been amazing,

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:06.420
there's nothing like it.

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:11.420
I mean, it's just this bi-directional thing that happens

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:17.100
and music and sports were kind of my first loves

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:23.700
and yeah, it's very difficult to describe,

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:30.020
I think accurately because it's like no other feeling.

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.540
Musically, how is it different than playing in a garage

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:37.900
with the band by yourself practicing?

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.540
Do you feel like you're creating something different

01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:47.540
when you got the guitar and the amp

01:25:47.900 --> 01:25:50.220
and just the sound dissipating out

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.860
and everybody's listening, is that?

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:55.700
It's, listen, the first time we did it

01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:57.180
and there's nobody in the stadium,

01:25:57.180 --> 01:25:59.260
first time I ever played in a stadium

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:03.340
and I'm just like, I'm out there in front

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:05.380
and just hitting different chords

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:07.860
and playing different licks and I'm like,

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.500
it's like I won a contest and I get to do this.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.100
But what's different about it,

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.340
and each venue is different.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:21.340
So if you, we went on the road with ZZ Top a few years ago,

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.420
which was incredible, loved Billy Gibbons, he's a Texan,

01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.140
incredible person and guitar player.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:32.580
But when you're playing in five to 7,000 seats,

01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:37.380
it's really, you're right there with them, with the crowd.

01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:39.820
And then when you play in an arena,

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.300
we toured with Bob Seeger on his last tour,

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:47.140
which was cool, played some shows with him.

01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:51.860
And again, the arena, they're all packed on top of you

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:56.660
and it's super loud, which was cool, meaning the crowd is.

01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:59.100
Stadiums is a completely different animal

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:04.980
and it's just a completely different experience.

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:08.420
Do you enjoy it versus like a smaller room?

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:10.300
Yeah.

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:13.420
As a guitarist, as a musician,

01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:16.500
what's your favorite like room to play of the size?

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:17.900
Any room that'll have me.

01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:23.740
Look, I think arenas are the perfect blend,

01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:28.500
if I had to say, because it's loud and 20, 30,000 people,

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.180
but like right up on you.

01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:36.180
Stadium, look, playing the stadiums with the Rolling Stones,

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.140
it just is gonna go on the head marker somewhere

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:43.700
is one of the more, I say this and I really mean it.

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:45.900
My life is like a punked episode.

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.180
It just hasn't, no one's burst in yet,

01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:53.340
but yeah, it's as cool as you think it is.

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:56.420
So 60 years, how do you think Mick Jagger still got it?

01:27:58.620 --> 01:27:59.620
How do you explain it?

01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:01.620
I gotta tell you something, I mean,

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:06.500
the funny thing is, wherever there is excellence,

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.740
people wanna know how'd you do it, right?

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:10.980
What's the secret?

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:15.260
Not only is Mick Jagger, and I think the songs

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:18.020
that Keith Richards and Mick Jagger wrote together,

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.020
if you go back and listen to the lyrics,

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:26.020
it's just incredibly poignant and I'm just a huge Stones fan.

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:32.340
But he works out like a maniac, right?

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:36.700
And it's that 10,000 hours thing and it's that,

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.580
hey, maybe I don't feel my best today,

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:41.940
but I'm gonna get up and do my routine and work out

01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:46.940
so that at his age, which I mean,

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:50.980
you can look at people at different ages chronologically

01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:54.340
that are, you know, maybe we're both at this age,

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.820
but I'm a lot older than you are and vice versa.

01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:02.820
And he just, I think it's the combination of raw talent

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:06.060
and the ability and he's very smart, right?

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:10.460
Like he's understands how to have interaction with a crowd

01:29:10.460 --> 01:29:13.820
and hold them in the palm of his hand and be an entertainer.

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:17.100
But then on top of that, the reason he can at this age

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:20.820
run around stadiums and be just as energetic

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:24.220
is he puts the work in and that's one thing step

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:26.620
that I think a lot of people miss sometimes

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:28.060
where they want that magic trick,

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:30.340
they wanna know what's the shortcut.

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:32.820
Most of the time the answer is there's no shortcut.

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.220
Yeah, you have to work hard on the way there

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.100
and work hard to stay on top.

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.060
That's it.

01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:41.900
And sometimes it's not even like work hard,

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.220
it's just like be a professional,

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:49.020
which that involves like in his case at his age

01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:51.740
with the amount of stuff you have to do on stage

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.140
and the way he does it.

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:53.980
For two hours.

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.300
This is a professional athlete.

01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.580
A professional athlete that has to do things

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:04.260
that are probably designed for 20 year olds

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.940
and 30 year olds has to do it at an older age,

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:08.740
which means like what do you have to do?

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:11.340
Well, he probably has like a whole physical routine

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:12.420
he has to do.

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:14.940
Diet, the whole thing and it's hard.

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:17.180
Look, if you wanna do great things,

01:30:17.180 --> 01:30:19.980
you probably have to do hard things to get there.

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.940
I'm not gonna make you pick,

01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.660
just stick on the stones for one more minute,

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:31.700
but what are some great Rolling Stones songs

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:36.020
that were impactful to you lyrically, musically,

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:41.020
maybe something you like playing like air guitar.

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.100
I don't know.

01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:45.020
Well, probably my favorites,

01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.820
I love Sympathy for the Devil.

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:50.980
It's a very, I don't know, sort of Faustian.

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:52.340
I love the lyrics.

01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:55.060
I love how the almost a voodoo beat

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.300
just kind of builds throughout the song.

01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:00.340
That's always been one of my favorites.

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:02.980
So in that song, he never mentions devil, does he?

01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.020
No, wait, sorry.

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:09.580
Like, you know, my name, there's like a flirtation

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:11.180
going on in the lyrics.

01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:12.020
It's kind of interesting.

01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:14.540
Yeah, it's here's all the trouble I've caused

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:16.940
along the way with you humans.

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:18.820
And I just think it's really, really great.

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.700
And musically builds really nicely.

01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:21.540
Yeah.

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.420
And it's like both fun and dark.

01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:24.620
It's cool.

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:29.620
It's a, there's a playful nature to it.

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:34.900
It's very stones, only they can pull it off

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:38.060
because it's like playful, but it's also like dark and cool.

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:38.900
Dangerous.

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:39.940
Dangerous, dangerous.

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:44.260
Yeah, and Gimme Shelter is just, you know,

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:48.340
and to this day, when I listen to the studio version

01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:50.940
and Mary Clayton just comes on and sings

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:55.500
that epic, iconic part.

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.820
And there's a documentary that was done

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:02.540
about backup singers, phenomenal.

01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:06.780
And it tells the story of that moment

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.180
in that song with Mary Clayton.

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:13.260
And it's just her voice and the way it unfolded

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:15.700
they got her out of bed at like 10 o'clock at night in LA.

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.780
And she's like the Rolling Stones

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:20.500
and went in and just killed it.

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:23.140
And I can't sing at all.

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:26.780
I'm by ordinance not around a microphone.

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:31.180
So I'm always in awe when someone can sing like that.

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:37.940
But, you know, those are some of my favorite

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:41.500
Rolling Stones songs and Paint It Black's awesome.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:42.660
I mean, I could go on.

01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:44.060
Yeah, Paint It Black is great.

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.020
Again, a song that builds is badass.

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:48.380
I mean, it defines their whole generation.

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:49.620
What made you pick up a guitar?

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:52.620
What made you fall in love with the guitar?

01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:55.100
It's just the coolest instrument, right?

01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:59.260
I mean, when you watched back then, you know,

01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.700
and I was kind of an old soul.

01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:05.580
I was listening at a fairly young age

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:09.420
to Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson,

01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:14.420
Lightning Hopkins, B.B. King, and just the soulfulness.

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:16.060
Thrills gone.

01:33:16.060 --> 01:33:16.900
Oh my God.

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:21.860
I mean, B.B. plays five notes and just kills it

01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:24.140
in the emotion that it evokes.

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:29.140
So I just was just in awe of the instrument.

01:33:29.420 --> 01:33:33.620
And, you know, I also, there's always somebody

01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:37.500
around who's a musician that just picks the instrument up

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.220
and can play, right?

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:41.180
And they're just so talented at it.

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:43.860
And they can just listen to a record and play it.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:45.700
That was never me.

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.860
I never took formal lessons.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:51.940
I had to grind, you know, to just make it sound

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:54.180
like I wanted it to sound.

01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:58.100
So both technically and ear, everything was hard work.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.780
Yeah, I mean, I could hear it.

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.380
And what they call, you know, you play.

01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:09.380
So my right hand, you know, the rhythm side of it is,

01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:12.340
that's probably, if I have anything, my strength.

01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:18.100
But there's something pretty amazing that happens

01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:22.500
when you get together with other people and play a song.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.860
In that moment where it hits the pocket

01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:27.940
and you all kind of know it,

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:31.140
and it's just such a cool feeling.

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:34.940
And it was interesting growing up because I was,

01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:36.620
again, I always had a eclectic interest.

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.780
So I loved math and physics and science.

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.100
So I had those friends and I was an athlete

01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.060
and played football and baseball and basketball.

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:47.780
So I had my jock friends and then I had my music friends.

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:51.620
And so it was just kind of that.

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:55.780
And so when I was still living in Los Angeles

01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.780
and had Legendary, I just missed playing.

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.580
And so I put this band together

01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:08.180
and called it the Ghost Hounds because, again,

01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:11.900
huge Robert Johnson fan and that legend

01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:15.260
of Robert Johnson selling his soul at the crossroads

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:17.140
in exchange for his musical talent.

01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.820
You guys have that in one of the videos.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:19.660
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:20.500
Such a cool video.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.660
Exactly, so I always, I just thought like,

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:25.580
that's such cool lore.

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:28.300
I just love the blues.

01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:31.220
So Robert Johnson would often would talk

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.420
about hell hounds on his trail.

01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:37.540
And so I always just thought, huh, what about ghost hounds?

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:41.460
So that's, I wish it were a more clever, deeper story,

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:43.740
but that's about it for the name.

01:35:43.740 --> 01:35:44.620
That's pretty deep.

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:45.740
Robert Johnson is incredible.

01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:48.300
But you also talk about that you connect

01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:50.820
to the storytelling of blues.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:53.700
So what makes a good story in a song?

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:57.820
Like what aspect of storytelling connects with you in song?

01:35:57.820 --> 01:35:59.100
So I'm a big lyrics guy too.

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:03.820
I love like deep lyric people like Tom Waits

01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:07.060
and like people that are like, you know, Leonard Cohen,

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:08.780
like they're even Bob Dylan.

01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:12.660
They're like, obviously, yes, poetry.

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:15.500
And then there's some people like the Rolling Stones there.

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:18.260
It's like seemingly simpler,

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.020
but it's still so much more to it.

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.780
It's like less is often more.

01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:25.660
It still tells a strong story.

01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:27.820
Yeah, and there's certain people

01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:31.060
and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are in this boat.

01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:32.980
Billy Gibbons is in this boat.

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:35.740
They just say things in a certain way.

01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:37.300
Those are just cool, right?

01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:42.300
It just, and so I write our music and lyrics.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:47.020
I have to tell a story.

01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:48.740
I have to know the characters in the song.

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:51.540
I'm not good at just writing some rhymes

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:54.820
and having it match up to the right key and the right music.

01:36:54.820 --> 01:36:59.060
I have to understand like, that's just me.

01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:01.540
And so I think that, look,

01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:04.460
if you have three or four minutes to tell a story,

01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:09.460
you have to be more efficient with your use of language

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:12.220
and you have to understand what you're building to,

01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:15.500
if anything, and evoke emotion

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:18.660
and hopefully for those three minutes,

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:22.380
get the listener to understand not only the point

01:37:22.380 --> 01:37:24.540
of the song, but where you're coming from

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:28.300
and to make you feel a certain way.

01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:31.860
There's a song that the audiences seem to like a lot

01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.380
on the new album called Good Old Days.

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:38.460
And I wrote that because especially during COVID

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:42.260
and reflecting on what normalcy looks like

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:44.580
and what happens when you're cut off,

01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:49.140
I just was kind of taken with this idea of

01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:53.700
that when you sit around and reminisce with friends,

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:58.700
oftentimes it's not just like some big event happened.

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.980
It's, remember that summer,

01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:03.060
we'd go up to the lake all the time

01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:05.380
and it's who you were with.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:09.580
And at the time, it probably seemed pretty pedestrian, right?

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.140
It just seemed like kind of a normal day,

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:14.020
but it was the company you were keeping.

01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.780
It was the time in your life.

01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.900
It was whatever it was.

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:22.620
And I just kind of struck me that right now we're doing stuff

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.220
that you're gonna reminisce about later

01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:26.260
that seems kind of ordinary,

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:29.140
be like, man, that was such a great time.

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:31.580
So the idea is be in the moment and all that stuff,

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:36.220
but these are the good old days and enjoy it

01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:39.460
and soak it in and kind of be present for it.

01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:42.380
Yeah, it's a great perspective to take on the present

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:44.380
because we are in the thing that we'll remember.

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:46.180
We're living through the thing we'll remember.

01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:47.700
And sometimes the things we'll remember

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.900
is the simple stuff, the little stuff.

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:50.740
Yeah.

01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:55.700
Outside of Keith Richards,

01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:58.620
who is the greatest, ridiculous question,

01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.180
but just indulge me.

01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:03.180
Who is the greatest blues guitarist of all time,

01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:04.660
rock guitarist of all time?

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:07.220
Well, you got a little bit of a hybrid

01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:08.500
with Jimi Hendrix, right?

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.420
Because he played the blues and he played rock and roll.

01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.620
So I think most guitarists would say

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:18.220
Jimi Hendrix is pretty ridiculous.

01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:19.180
That probably for me,

01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:21.380
I'm a huge, huge, huge Hendrix fan to play.

01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:22.780
Well, because he can't, you can't.

01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:24.820
I mean, even to this day,

01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:27.260
I don't care technology, pedals, whatever,

01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:31.540
he just somehow fused with the instrument.

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:34.700
I can't be sitting here in Austin, Texas

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:37.940
without mentioning one of the great guitar players

01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.220
of all time in Stevie Ray Vaughn.

01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:42.300
See, that's how I know you're like a rock star.

01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:43.860
You're sucking up to the audience.

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:47.500
Well, no, but you have listeners all over the place,

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:51.060
but Stevie Ray Vaughn is another one of those.

01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:51.900
Yeah, he's incredible.

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.660
Just blows me away.

01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:57.140
And then with the older guys,

01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:01.100
B.B. King, Hubert Sumlin, Clapton.

01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:01.940
Yeah.

01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:06.380
Clapton, I saw him on his last tour

01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:08.900
and just walked out on my,

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.700
just like unbelievable how he still sounds.

01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:16.380
And both electric and acoustic.

01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:17.220
Yeah.

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:18.620
Just so strange.

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:19.700
Absolute master.

01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.980
And the greatest storyteller,

01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:24.020
you mentioned Bob Seeger.

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:26.300
That's an interesting one.

01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:29.860
He almost doesn't get enough credit,

01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:31.540
I feel like, for how great he is.

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:33.380
Obviously he's super famous, but.

01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:36.500
No, he's, in his voice.

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:39.180
I also, I had the privilege of getting friendly

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:43.580
with John Fogarty, John Fogarty and CCR fame.

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:48.100
And he's another one that's just the way he phrases things.

01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.180
And you just look at the catalog of stuff he wrote.

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.020
Amazing talent.

01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:59.900
I read Bruce Springsteen's book and was,

01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:02.860
I'm a fan, but after reading the book,

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:05.860
it was really, you go back and listen to his lyrics

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:10.860
and the way he pours himself out is pretty incredible.

01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:16.060
And then again, with the old blues guys,

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:21.180
I just think the emotion they could get out of playing

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:23.100
like the, staying on the one, right?

01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:25.220
Just playing the same rhythm.

01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:30.220
John Lee Hooker, you listen to Manish Boy by Muddy Waters.

01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:36.140
And it's just, there's something so,

01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:39.100
it just draws me in every time and the emotion

01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:40.860
they're able to get out of things.

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.420
And I'm also a huge Chuck Berry fan.

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:47.020
I just think that sound is, I love it.

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.060
Do you know how to play Johnny B. Goode?

01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:53.740
I do, I do, yeah.

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:54.980
That's good.

01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:59.020
Maybe, one of the great moments, at least of my childhood,

01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:04.060
was back to the future and watching Michael J. Fox plug in

01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.380
and then at the end, play at the dance

01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:11.980
to save his parents with Johnny B. Goode, pretty awesome.

01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.820
Yeah, the guitar is so much more than a musical instrument.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:17.500
It feels like, it's like the,

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:20.460
in the 20th century, it's like the car.

01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:23.020
Like it defines so much of Hollywood,

01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:25.880
so much of a generation of what it means to be,

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:28.820
I don't know, what it means to be a man,

01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:31.100
you know what it means to be a human in America.

01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:32.660
It's fascinating.

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:37.540
Emblematic to me of a certain type of music.

01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:40.460
And that's, I made a documentary years ago

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.660
called It Might Get Loud with Jimmy Page, The Edge.

01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:44.980
I highly recommend it.

01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:46.540
Everybody watch that documentary.

01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:48.980
It's an incredible celebration of the guitar.

01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:53.540
Yeah, it says Jimmy Page, Jack White from White Stripes.

01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:54.380
The Edge.

01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:56.500
And The Edge from U2.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:58.780
Okay, all right, well now you have to tell the story

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:02.460
of that one, because how the heck did that all come together?

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.540
Because it's so fascinating.

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:07.380
Such different musicians all coming together,

01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:09.780
talking about their story,

01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:11.540
talking about how they approach the music,

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.780
and also playing together a little bit

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:15.380
in this casual kind of setting.

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:18.820
Well, look, one day I came downstairs

01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:21.100
and the Rolling Stone magazine is sitting there

01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.580
and it was the 50th,

01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:25.900
was the 50 top guitarists of all time, their list.

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:28.380
And then I had some other financial report

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:31.260
with video games and the top video game at the time

01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:32.980
was Guitar Hero, right?

01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:35.260
And then there was a third thing, I can't recall it,

01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:37.380
but I just, and I said to myself,

01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:42.380
what is it about the guitar that is so central

01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:45.060
to the rock and roll, whatever you want to call it?

01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:46.980
Like, why is that the symbol?

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:52.100
And I said to myself, I want to ask Jimmy Page

01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.260
why he picked up the guitar,

01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.180
because he's Jimmy Page, right?

01:43:56.180 --> 01:44:00.540
And so I called a friend of mine, Davis Guggenheim,

01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:02.580
who had directed Inconvenient Truth,

01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:03.700
and I think still is,

01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:06.780
but at the time was the biggest documentary ever.

01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:09.100
And I called Davis and I said, look, I have this idea.

01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:12.980
I want to make this movie about the guitar,

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.540
about different eras and styles and whatever,

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:16.980
but I've never made a documentary.

01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:18.140
I don't know how to do that.

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.420
So I was just looking for advice.

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:24.740
And thankfully, because he's one of the best

01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:28.300
documentarians ever, Davis is like, you know what?

01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:29.500
I can't get this out of my head.

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:32.460
I'll direct it, which was amazing.

01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:34.500
And we wrote three names down

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:38.180
that represented different eras and different styles.

01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:41.700
Rarely do you get, you know, you go three for three,

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:44.660
but it was those three guys.

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:49.660
And it was just such an incredible experience

01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:53.820
to sit there and get to know Jimmy Page, you know?

01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:57.580
I mean, it was like, and he was, it was like Gandalf, man.

01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:00.340
He was like always Jimmy Page.

01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:02.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.780
That was so cool to see him.

01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:06.700
Gandalf was, there's like a wisdom,

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.300
there's a calmness to him,

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:12.620
compared to like the restlessness of Jack White.

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:16.780
Like the, I mean, that combination was just fascinating.

01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:19.780
It was one of the coolest experiences ever.

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:23.220
And one of the things, there was a moment where Jimmy,

01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:26.260
he was going through his guitar case

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:28.180
and he had the double neck from Stairway to Heaven

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:30.820
and he handed it to me and I was like, mm-hmm.

01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:35.820
I mean, it's like somebody handing you X caliber or something.

01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:38.140
Amazing experience.

01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:40.980
And The Edge, one of the kindest human beings

01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:44.900
you'll ever meet in your life, just an amazing person.

01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:47.060
And I think he hit it right in the head with Jack

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.820
is he's got that energy, you know,

01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:52.260
and constantly pushing himself.

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.660
But it's hard to believe it's been, I think,

01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:58.140
10 or 11 or maybe even 12 years since it came out, but.

01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:02.740
After watching it, I realized like how much it was needed.

01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:07.340
And I was almost surprised it didn't already exist.

01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:12.340
It was like, yeah, the guitar wasn't quite celebrated

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:14.780
like explicitly, we almost didn't acknowledge it.

01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.700
How important it was culturally.

01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:18.540
It's kind of amazing.

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:20.580
And the way it closed from the song, the-

01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:21.420
The weight.

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.460
It's called The Weight, yeah, by the band.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.700
Yeah. Yeah.

01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.180
That's because they didn't want to go home.

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:27.260
Yeah.

01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:30.020
We were shooting on a Warner Brothers soundstage

01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:32.060
for three days when we called it the summit

01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:34.340
where the three of them came together.

01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:38.500
And the two things I'll never forget is when Jimmy starts

01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:40.860
to play the riff from Whole Lotta Love,

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:46.460
Edge and Jack ceased to be rock, you know,

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:50.780
rock gods or whatever and had the same 15 year old kid

01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:53.340
feeling that I did, you could see in their face.

01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.620
And then at the end, they're like, hey, can we play?

01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:57.060
We just want to, we don't want to go.

01:46:57.060 --> 01:46:58.860
Can we just play something acoustically?

01:46:58.860 --> 01:46:59.700
Yeah.

01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:00.860
So we printed out the lyrics.

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:01.940
That's what they wanted to play.

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:06.500
And they just sat there and sat on those couches and just-

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:07.540
Such a good way to end.

01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:09.420
Yeah, incredible.

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:12.460
What's your guitar rig set up like?

01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:15.340
You also, you have a few guitars.

01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:17.540
First, let's just put it on the line.

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:21.860
So what's better, Les Paul or Strat?

01:47:21.860 --> 01:47:24.460
Well, I'm not going to get into what's better

01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:26.380
because I'm sure that'll start a flood of whatever.

01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:27.860
For me-

01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:29.220
I'm going to say it's Strat.

01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:32.020
All right, well I'm a Les Paul.

01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:34.740
My main instrument is a Les Paul.

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:36.740
But I, okay, okay, let me just put it on the table.

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:39.060
I'm speaking as somebody who literally,

01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:41.700
I don't think I've ever actually strummed a chord

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:42.540
on a Les Paul.

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:43.380
So I've been-

01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:45.380
All right, so you're uninitiated.

01:47:45.380 --> 01:47:48.020
Exactly, so I don't speak from experience,

01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:50.540
but it's probably because of Hendrix,

01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.260
who's so deeply influenced by Hendrix

01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:55.260
that I just kind of followed in his footsteps

01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.700
and clapped in and so on.

01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:01.180
The amazing thing to me is if you look back at Leo Fender

01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:03.660
and what the Gibson Guitar Company and Les Paul did

01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:07.500
in the 50s, those are still the shapes

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.740
and the perfect thing today, right?

01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:12.980
The Strat and the Telecaster and the Les Paul.

01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:15.660
They got it right way back then.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:20.060
So I have my main guitar.

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:21.300
You got to name your guitar.

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.940
So my main guitar is named Hazel,

01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:26.300
and it's a 59 Les Paul.

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:31.020
And there's something magical in that year,

01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:34.180
like a Stradivarius, and they're just,

01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:36.900
there's something different about them.

01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:40.380
So I play that, and then I play it through

01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:45.420
sort of my main rigs, either a 59 Fender Twin

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:50.500
or a 65 Marshall.

01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:52.860
And then when we're on the road now,

01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:54.860
because when you use older vintage stuff,

01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:56.940
you just got to be super careful with the tubes

01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:58.700
and everything, it has to be reliable.

01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:01.900
So very nicely, the guys from 2ROCK sent me

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.620
some of their amps and they're really,

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:05.460
because I don't use any new stuff,

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:07.460
but the 2ROCK stuff is pretty great.

01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:08.300
So that's actually what I'm using.

01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:11.140
Oh, it gets close to the sound that you like

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:11.980
with the Marshall.

01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:14.020
Yeah, and it's new and reliable.

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.460
So that's what I'm using on the road right now.

01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:17.220
Do people use emulation?

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:19.220
Do they use software or is it still?

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.060
They do.

01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:21.340
I personally don't.

01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:23.700
I go, I don't have many pedals.

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:26.860
I use a Klon, an old, vintage Klon,

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.940
straight into the amp and that's it.

01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.980
Just as old school as possible.

01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:32.500
Is there other cool guitars you have

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.500
that kind of stand out?

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:36.780
I have a bunch of what they call

01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:40.260
black guard telecasters from the 50s,

01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:42.140
which are pretty great.

01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:44.020
What are those, black guard telecasters?

01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:45.780
Yeah, so it just, you know, it's in the 50s.

01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:47.900
Oh, they actually legit have a black guard.

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:48.740
Pick guard.

01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:49.580
Got it.

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:51.300
But they're incredible.

01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:53.220
What's the color of the telecaster itself?

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:55.220
Most of them are yellow with black

01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:57.420
and then they got into different configurations,

01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:01.580
but there's something, I have a 51 telecaster

01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:04.700
that I play in Open G and in songs with Open G

01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:09.020
that just, again, there's something, you know,

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:11.020
and I'll take all the help I can get

01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.180
in terms of, you know, making it sound great.

01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:15.860
So I'll try to find the magic ones.

01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:18.100
What's your writing process like

01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:21.620
for the music and the lyrics?

01:50:21.620 --> 01:50:26.100
Is there, do you have to go to the mountains?

01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:27.620
Is there whiskey involved?

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.900
What do you have to do or do you just write a little bit

01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:31.780
whenever you have a moment of free time?

01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:33.780
I'm a boring guy because I don't drink.

01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:37.220
I don't, I just, I figure I can screw things up

01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.780
plenty on my own without adding anything.

01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:40.900
It's a good call.

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:45.900
But, you know, for me, it either starts with a riff,

01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:51.220
just something that I think is an interesting, you know,

01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:54.220
riff or tone that I can kind of sink my teeth

01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:55.780
into a little bit.

01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:57.700
And a lot of times I'll write a title

01:50:59.060 --> 01:51:02.460
and love a title and then start to backfill.

01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:04.420
So the title is almost like an idea.

01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:06.900
Yeah, like this is where I want to be

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:10.260
and then start kind of writing it out.

01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:13.940
And again, I just have to know,

01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:16.540
am I writing from a character's point of view?

01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:20.220
Am I writing about someone or something, you know,

01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:22.060
as like the narrator?

01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:23.700
And, you know, what is this person?

01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:24.540
Are they happy?

01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:25.380
Are they sad?

01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:27.340
Are they, where are they in life?

01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:30.700
I don't know if all that, like great writers,

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:34.180
I'm sure would say, why don't you just write?

01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:36.100
You don't need all that.

01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:38.420
But that's, for me, that's my process.

01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:39.980
I'm not so sure about that.

01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:44.460
I bet you quite a lot of writers have created a world

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:47.900
in their mind before they even put the simplest

01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:48.820
of words down.

01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:51.660
So yeah, there's quite a lot to that.

01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.780
What's your favorite song to play?

01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:00.620
Is there some favorite ones you go to?

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:04.500
Both play and kind of, I'm sure you love singing.

01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:05.340
No, no, no, no.

01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:06.740
No, you don't?

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:10.860
I'm not, I'm neither talented nor do I have the desire.

01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:14.220
And I think, you know, if you come see the show,

01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:16.500
you won't see a microphone anywhere near me.

01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.020
But do you, I mean, do you hear,

01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:19.420
like when you're thinking about lyrics,

01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.860
do you hear the idea of the words?

01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:22.700
100%.

01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:26.300
And especially what's great, you know, with Trey

01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:28.620
is I write for his voice.

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:32.460
And then we have these amazing backup singers

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:35.220
that are just, and I can hear all of it.

01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:36.500
I just can't do it.

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:41.740
And so I'd say to, of our stuff,

01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:46.340
there's a song called Half My Fault that I play in Open G

01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:49.060
that just, I love playing the song.

01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:50.540
I love that energy.

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:53.940
And then there's, we have a new blues album coming out

01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:58.940
and there's a song called Baby We're Through

01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:01.260
and it just stays on the one.

01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:03.820
And for non-musicians, that means,

01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:05.540
like in a lot of rock and roll and blues,

01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:09.300
it's what's called a one, four, five progression

01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:11.020
from your kind of root note.

01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:13.100
And you would hear, if you're a non-musician,

01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:14.740
if you heard it, you'd be like, oh yeah,

01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.500
that's a lot of songs.

01:53:16.500 --> 01:53:18.940
And this song just stays on the same groove,

01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:23.380
like La Grange or Shake Your Hips or any of those songs.

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:26.900
And it's just got this unbelievable energy

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:27.740
and it's fun to play,

01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:30.900
but I have to keep the same rhythmic thing

01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.820
going for the whole song.

01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:34.020
With that simplicity, I mean,

01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:36.660
the personality of the song can really shine.

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:41.660
I mean, Trey's, I mean, that guy, really cool.

01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:44.060
It just comes through.

01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:45.740
I mean, I guess you need that from a lead singer.

01:53:45.740 --> 01:53:47.380
It's just like, it's just.

01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:48.500
Yeah, you gotta have that.

01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:51.180
And my other guitar player, Johnny Bob,

01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:56.420
he's a phenomenal, I mean, like a legitimate guitar slinger.

01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:03.260
We probably split the leads 70, 30,

01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:08.020
and he is just, there's times sometimes I look over at him

01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:09.500
and I'm like, I'm being a fan right now

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.860
because what you just laid down is pretty good.

01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:14.060
From a lead perspective,

01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.260
what's the most fun thing to play?

01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:17.540
What kind of stuff do you like?

01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:18.460
Do you like slow?

01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:21.780
Do you like, I mean, if you feel like thrill is gone.

01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:23.980
So if you look at B.B. King, sometimes one note

01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:25.820
just bending the shit out of them.

01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:27.060
What do you call that, vibrato?

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.700
Yeah, if I'm gonna play the lead,

01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:30.300
it's a certain kind of feel.

01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:33.860
Slow blues is probably my favorite to play,

01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:35.460
or something that's got a little more

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:37.820
of that Chuck Berry drive

01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.020
where you can be rhythmic in the lead.

01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:45.260
I can't, the shredding thing that those guys do

01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:47.580
is that that's not my.

01:54:47.620 --> 01:54:51.380
I was actually always able to do that really well.

01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:53.580
Like you mentioned people that pick up fast,

01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:55.900
like maybe it's the classical piano training.

01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.900
I can play super fast on guitar, super technical,

01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:02.060
but to me the hardest thing and my favorite thing

01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:06.420
is it's just, it has probably less to do with the guitar,

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:10.220
more living on life that's worth playing a guitar for,

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:13.660
which is like a certain kind of emotion

01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:15.540
that you can put into the notes.

01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:16.980
And that has to do with bending notes.

01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:20.860
Well, like bending notes is a whole other art form of,

01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:26.340
I worked surprisingly a long time on Comfortably Numb.

01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:31.940
And there's, so David Gilmore does a lot of bending

01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:35.300
and they're simple, they sound simple,

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:40.300
but the dynamics of them to express like a buildup

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:45.460
in the way it's held and there's often a vibrato at the top

01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:51.420
for a bit, just that the, it's almost like a sigh

01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:54.420
and a sigh of relief and the buildup.

01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:56.780
I mean, it's just the, that's an art form for him

01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:58.100
that's hard to get right.

01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:00.220
It's not just playing a note, playing a note,

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:04.660
playing a note, it's in that like dynamic movement

01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:06.420
of a note that so much can happen.

01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:08.260
That's where the blues just happens to.

01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:11.420
It's, look, I'm a huge Freddie King fan too, right?

01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:14.360
And you listen to these guys and they're,

01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:17.300
you sit there and they're like, man,

01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:21.420
you're playing in a small range on the neck,

01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:26.860
but in, it's like, I know the notes you're playing

01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:30.380
and I'm playing them too, but not like that, right?

01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:33.460
I mean, it's in, Gilmore is certainly one of those guys

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.980
that's incredible guitar player.

01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:40.500
And yet another chapter of an amazing life.

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:43.060
You love football, like you meant, you play football?

01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:43.900
Yes.

01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:44.720
What positions you play?

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:45.560
Wider saver.

01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:48.200
Wider saver, awesome.

01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:52.800
So maybe we can talk a little bit about your love

01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:57.800
of football and the fact that you are part owner

01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:00.760
of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:01.600
Yeah.

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:04.000
So, I mean, where do we start to start at the beginning?

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.240
Let's start at the end.

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:06.800
Why the Steelers?

01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:09.640
What attracted you to the, first of all,

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.640
I think not to be controversial,

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.000
but one of the best uniforms in football

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:19.120
in terms of just like black and gold, just.

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:20.920
Decal only on one side.

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.920
Yeah, it's great.

01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:23.160
Yeah, the helmet.

01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:27.120
Look, I've bled black and gold since I was a little boy.

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:29.600
I grew up in upstate New York

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:32.480
and the first football game I ever saw

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:34.440
was the Steelers in the Superbowl

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:35.800
as a really little kid.

01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.000
And it just, I mean, Jack Lambert and Joe Green

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.920
and Franco Harris and those guys were like,

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:45.680
came down from Olympia, Mount Olympus or something.

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:48.520
And I just was enamored with the team.

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:50.800
And because we only had three channels,

01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:53.040
the only time I'd get to see them is occasionally

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:55.600
when they were the game of the week or something.

01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:02.040
And I just loved to me what they stood for, the toughness.

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:07.640
And they played football the way that I thought was great.

01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:10.080
I was a huge Jack Lambert fan,

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:14.040
our hall of fame linebacker

01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:15.840
who just intimidated everybody.

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.880
So that was like the, that was the decade

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.840
of the steel curtain, like the,

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:24.280
I mean, arguably one of the great sort of defensive

01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:26.600
of in football history.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:30.520
And also one of the greatest football teams period

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.400
in football history.

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:34.160
I've been a lifelong fan

01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:38.760
and was very fortunate to meet Mr. Rooney.

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:43.000
The Rooney family started the team in 1933,

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:48.160
got to know him and just was asked

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.760
to be part of the ownership group.

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:52.520
I think it was the end of 2007.

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.520
First year as part of the group in 2008,

01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:59.520
we won the Superbowl and it was like beyond surreal

01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:01.880
and just beyond surreal.

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:06.880
And it's amazing to be able to do.

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:12.840
I mean, the Rooney family is one of those most revered

01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:16.800
in sports for the way they conduct themselves.

01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:20.960
Mr. Rooney passed away, I think five years ago now

01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:23.960
and we lost him, but was a champion, helped build the league.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:27.280
I mean, put the league as we know it together.

01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:29.840
More importantly, was a civil rights champion

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:33.400
who created what we now call the Rooney rule

01:59:34.520 --> 01:59:36.040
to make sure that we're being fair

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:40.440
about giving minority coaches a chance to get hired.

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:44.720
And just as one of the most kind

01:59:44.720 --> 01:59:47.880
and amazing human beings I ever met.

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:51.880
It's incredible what sport does

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:55.960
to bring out the best in people,

01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:58.320
to give people hope, to inspire people.

01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.840
There is something about football

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:04.840
that has all the elements of a great sport.

02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:09.880
It's the teamwork, it's the sort of the combat aspect of it.

02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.840
It's like, it's the purity of it.

02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:16.840
It's of like strength and power and speed

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.720
and all the elements of like last minute,

02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:25.120
close calls required to win the game.

02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:27.760
And where referee decisions,

02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.320
of course that's essential for a sport,

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.920
can screw up the whole thing.

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:32.240
Just go all of it together.

02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:37.000
I think just, I don't know, it gives the drama

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.080
and the triumphs are just beautiful.

02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:42.480
Like some of my favorite memories,

02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.680
I don't know if it's an accident

02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:45.640
or this is common with people,

02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:48.360
is just with friends watching football

02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:50.040
and connecting over that.

02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:54.200
Yeah, well, look, it's an incredible game

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.080
because there's nowhere to hide, right?

02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.680
You're out there on the field.

02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:02.080
You know, it's a great game that requires

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.320
not only all those attributes that you said,

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:07.560
but it's incredibly complex game.

02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:09.160
So if you don't know what you're looking at

02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:12.360
and you don't understand how complex defenses

02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:14.880
are trying to disguise what they're doing,

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:17.040
offenses are trying to overcome that

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:22.040
and you can set up one play the entire game.

02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:26.920
But a team that plays well together, right?

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:28.320
Knows their plays inside and out,

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:30.360
knows their assignments inside and out,

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.920
can overcome and beat a more physically gifted team

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:38.760
because of that aspect of working together.

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:43.000
One of the things that I always loved about sports

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.000
is just you're out there,

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.960
there's a set of rules and there's a scoreboard.

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:51.880
So at the end of that game, it says,

02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:55.040
and you can make excuses about the refs

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:56.240
or this happened or that happened,

02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:01.240
but at the end of the day, did you go out and compete?

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:06.200
And when you went out and were a competitor,

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:08.280
how did it work out, right?

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:11.320
And the simplicity of that and the purity of that

02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:15.720
is something that I always have been drawn to.

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:19.360
What about the business of sort of owning a team

02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:20.520
or putting together a team

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:23.920
to build up a team that's going to be a great team?

02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:25.280
What are some interesting aspects

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.680
that people might not realize that you can carry over

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:31.880
from all the other experience you have in business?

02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:36.160
I think the hardest thing about professional sports,

02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:39.720
right now it's individuals getting paid money

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:42.840
to play a sport, which is different than,

02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:45.080
it's certainly different than amateur.

02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:48.400
And the decisions that are hard

02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:50.600
is when you get to know somebody

02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.120
who's a player on the team

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.160
and either they're at the end of their career

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.320
or you need to go in a different direction

02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:00.800
and that person who's done everything that you've asked,

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.880
whatever the coaches have asked of that person

02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:05.920
and you get close to them.

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:09.040
And then when they have to be traded, released

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:12.080
or whatever happens, that's sad.

02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:17.080
And being able to stand back and in some ways

02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:20.960
be dispassionate and not be a fan, right?

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:25.840
There's a, I'm on the baseball hall of fame board

02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:29.600
and one of the guys that's on the board of me

02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:30.600
is Jerry Reinsdorf.

02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:32.840
And I think it was Jerry who said,

02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:35.520
if you act like a fan, you'll be sitting with them.

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.800
Which I thought was kind of funny.

02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:40.600
Well, I got to push back on that a little bit

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:43.720
as by way of a fan asking a dumb question.

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.240
Okay, let me just give some examples.

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.600
It's very common in sport.

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.360
It's funny you said this example of like

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:57.360
certain great players going to another team

02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:59.000
right at the end of their career.

02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:02.960
And it always makes me sad.

02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:04.360
It almost makes me want to wish

02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:06.560
that you kind of retired right there.

02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:10.840
From a perspective of just like,

02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:15.520
do you ever as an owner, but just in that space,

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:18.720
think about like the Steelers

02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:21.640
in the full arc of human history.

02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:23.920
So not like as a business.

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:26.160
I mean, okay, this question might be absurd.

02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:28.640
I don't have to think about it as a business.

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:30.480
You know, I'm a minority owner

02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:33.080
so I can think about it almost as a fan,

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:34.080
but I'm sorry, go ahead.

02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:35.400
Yeah, well, that's what I mean.

02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:38.440
I suppose this is a dumb question to think of,

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:42.960
like of a business in that way.

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:45.680
Not just investment, but like,

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:50.480
like legacy of like what footprint would you leave

02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:52.760
on this world, on this history?

02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:55.960
That is one thing that I can say unequivocally.

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:59.400
And I only have the experience that I have.

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:02.440
But one of the things that I'm so proud of

02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:07.720
about the way the Steelers conduct themselves is,

02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:08.920
and that's the Rooney family.

02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:10.600
That's the legacy of the Rooney family

02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:13.480
is asking constantly about what's right for the league,

02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:15.400
what's right for the players.

02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:19.040
You know, what's the right thing to do here?

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.200
And that's something that I would hear Mr. Rooney say

02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.040
all the time.

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:25.440
So I think that legacy is important

02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:29.640
because ultimately the team belongs to that city, right?

02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:32.600
Belongs to those fans and, you know,

02:05:32.600 --> 02:05:35.360
the owners are the custodians of that.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:39.200
So I think, and when you realize

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:42.360
what sports teams mean to the fans,

02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:45.480
the memories that it creates, the bonds that it creates,

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:47.640
it's a, you know, it's a responsibility.

02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:54.560
And I think that you do have to think beyond the,

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:57.160
you know, certainly not just dollars and cents,

02:05:57.160 --> 02:06:02.160
but just sports is a very big deal in our society.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.720
And it has to be, I think held to a standard

02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:11.720
that's not just, well, were we profitable this year?

02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:14.840
That's, there are other businesses for that.

02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:16.240
It is certainly a business.

02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:19.200
I don't mean to romanticize to the point that it's not,

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:22.240
but to me it's more than that,

02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:24.800
or at least my experience has been that it's more than that.

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.640
It's a source of meaning for millions of people.

02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:32.120
Like, and you see that most like during COVID, for example,

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.720
when there's so much desperation,

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:35.480
so many people losing their jobs,

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:37.360
so many people having to deal with the uncertainty

02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:39.040
of what the future holds.

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:42.840
There's something about sports that just unites us that,

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:47.520
again, the tragedy and the triumphs of sport,

02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:50.000
of uniting, of gathering together

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.440
with your friends, with family, shared experience

02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:56.680
of over like this, yeah, over just team,

02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:59.960
over rooting for your team, for your city, ultimately.

02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:03.320
And the access, you know, again, as I alluded to,

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:05.320
we didn't have anything when I was growing up,

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:07.760
but I would pour through the box scores.

02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:10.320
I was a huge Yankee fan and Steeler fan,

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:13.680
and feeling some ownership of that, right?

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:16.280
That I could read the box score and relive what they did,

02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:18.840
and occasionally see them on TV

02:07:18.840 --> 02:07:22.480
and feel like I was part of that celebration

02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:24.120
when they won and everything.

02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:26.160
It's a very powerful thing.

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:29.400
You've been exceptionally successful

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.960
in a bunch of avenues and a bunch of efforts.

02:07:31.960 --> 02:07:34.680
What advice would you give to a young person today?

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:38.200
A high school student, a college undergraduate

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:42.560
that's thinking about career,

02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:44.880
maybe advice, not about just career,

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:48.000
but about how to live a life they can be proud of?

02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:51.720
You know, we talked earlier about intellectual honesty,

02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:55.120
and to me, that's the first step of just saying,

02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:58.000
to the best of your ability, who am I,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.920
and what's important to me,

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:01.960
and what do I wanna do and accomplish?

02:08:02.960 --> 02:08:05.040
If you can start with that

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:09.960
and develop some sort of rules-based philosophical,

02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:14.000
here's what I'll do, what I won't do,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.160
and that way, you can be flexible and pliable,

02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:19.160
and you're gonna need to be,

02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:24.160
but if you still have a compass that tells you,

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:28.240
hey, at least I know this is the path I'm gonna take,

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:29.880
I think that's very important.

02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:33.000
The rules you're referring to, the principles,

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.800
that's kind of like underlying integrity,

02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:39.000
so knowing what lines you don't cross on this path.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.760
Exactly right, because if you have those absolutes,

02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:46.240
there are many decisions that come into focus very quickly,

02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:49.040
right, because, hey, that's not for me,

02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:53.960
or, hey, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to do X, Y, and Z.

02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:56.360
And it has to do with the thing you were talking about.

02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:57.400
It's kind of interesting,

02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.120
you mentioned earlier in the conversation

02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:03.360
about slippery slope, and that's how often it happens,

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:07.800
like how the slipping into unethical behavior happens.

02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:09.920
It's the slippery slope of little adjustments.

02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:13.960
You put stuff off, and I found that to be,

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.800
I've been fortunate to not have to encounter these moments

02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:22.720
very much in my life, but I still encounter them.

02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:25.360
That's what integrity, I think, looks like,

02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:29.080
as the slippery slope is happening,

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:33.280
those little things is, without drama,

02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.960
without making a show of it,

02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.600
making a decision that stands behind your principles

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:40.320
and just walking away.

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:42.920
Yeah, and besides the big ideas,

02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:46.080
I'm gonna change the world, I'm gonna innovate,

02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:48.080
I'm gonna do all those other things,

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:51.320
I also start, if I'm giving any advice,

02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:54.160
which we can debate whether or not

02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:57.920
I should be giving advice, but just in terms of,

02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:59.120
well, let me start with this.

02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:01.160
Are you a good friend?

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.880
Can you be counted on?

02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:07.120
Do you do what you say you're going to do, right?

02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.800
Are you accountable to what you sign up for,

02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:12.080
and do you hold others accountable, right?

02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:13.760
What does all that look like?

02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:18.760
And then I think it's being as intellectually curious

02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:20.160
and well-read as you can be.

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:23.360
We live in a world that is designed to distract you.

02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:27.560
And being able to sit with your thoughts

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:30.920
or go on a walk and think deeply about something,

02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:34.680
and not just surface area, you text me, I text you back,

02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:36.640
and we decide the fate of the world

02:10:36.640 --> 02:10:39.120
based on a couple of text messages or something.

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:46.600
You don't wanna lose touch, I think, with being well-read

02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:50.800
and understanding and standing on great thinkers' shoulders

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:55.360
and learning from those works.

02:10:55.360 --> 02:11:00.360
And then I also think that there's resiliency

02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:02.320
and then there's grit.

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:04.400
And I heard someone say one time

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:06.880
that those are slightly different.

02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:11.400
And I'm also, I know that there are all kinds

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:16.400
of challenges in life that are tragic, that are unfair.

02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:19.280
There's no question that's the world we live in.

02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:23.080
But for me personally, to try as much as possible

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:26.880
not to be in the victim mindset,

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:30.680
because unfair things are gonna happen.

02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:35.680
And we all wanna live in an idealistic, just world.

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:38.760
That should be what we aspire to.

02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:43.000
I haven't seen that yet, I haven't experienced that yet,

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.120
but yet you still have to function in that world.

02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:52.120
So I think that that resiliency thing is very important.

02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:56.920
And then putting yourself out there, right?

02:11:56.920 --> 02:11:58.280
Because if you play scared

02:11:58.280 --> 02:11:59.920
and you're always afraid to fail,

02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:03.800
this is probably a dumb way

02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:05.160
to get to the end of the podcast.

02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:09.040
But there are times, especially on Mount West,

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:13.720
I love the big sky out in Montana, Idaho, places like that.

02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:16.080
And when you look up at night, it's almost like,

02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:18.280
I've never seen anything like this before,

02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:21.240
because there's no light pollution, so to speak.

02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:23.920
And sometimes when I look up,

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:26.200
the most daunting problems that I'm experiencing,

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.640
I'm like, those things have been there

02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:33.320
for a billion years or whatever, and I'll be gone.

02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:38.160
And it doesn't, the most famous person on earth,

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:43.160
200 years ago, so it's pretty fleeting.

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:46.600
And so make sure you have a good journey,

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:49.040
and especially coming out of COVID,

02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:52.240
I think telling people that you care about them

02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:55.400
and maintaining and cultivating your friendships

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:59.280
and relationships, and they're not just transactional, right?

02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:03.320
And making sure that someday when you're laying there,

02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:05.600
you can say, yeah, I was a good family member.

02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:08.680
I was a good friend.

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:10.480
I was someone that could be counted on.

02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:13.760
I think all those things go into the mix of,

02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:15.800
however you wanna take the journey.

02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:17.240
So when you look up to the stars,

02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:21.240
do you think about that quickly approaching end of yours?

02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:22.880
Do you think about your own mortality?

02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:24.320
Do you think about your death?

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:26.120
Are you afraid of your death?

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:28.680
I'm a huge fan of Stoicism, right?

02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:30.840
I read a lot of Stoicism.

02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:34.080
I think Ryan Holiday's done a great job

02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:37.080
of bringing some of that back into the forefront.

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.360
It's just really thought-provoking to me,

02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:43.840
and rings, a lot of it rings, just hits me

02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:45.680
and says, I think that's right.

02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:49.760
And that momento mori thing, which is,

02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:53.400
hey, we're all gonna die, so you should contemplate it.

02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:56.720
There's a finality to this thing.

02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:01.160
And so I think if you can rightly frame that

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:05.160
between fretting about it every day and being afraid,

02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.360
and being so laissez-faire that you think

02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:09.840
you're gonna live forever,

02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:13.560
it'll influence some of the decisions you make.

02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:16.960
It will influence the way you attack things

02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:21.080
and hopefully the way that you live your life.

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:26.080
So yes, I wouldn't say I obsess over it,

02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:28.240
and I wouldn't say it's omnipresent,

02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:31.480
but because I read a lot of Stoicism,

02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.680
and just I think it's really important

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:36.960
and just I think it's right to pause and say,

02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:38.760
who knows, right?

02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:41.320
There's gonna be an expiration date.

02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:44.000
And if it happened tomorrow,

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.760
have I done the things I wanted to do?

02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:50.160
And am I the person I wanted to be?

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:52.120
And I think it's important along the way

02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:53.880
to check those things.

02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:58.480
Yeah, I try to make sure that I actually visualize this,

02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:01.400
that I'm okay dying at the end of the day,

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:03.160
at the end of each day.

02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:05.480
If this is the last thing I do in my life,

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.760
is talking to you.

02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:09.120
Oh, good Lord.

02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:12.840
I'm happy.

02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:15.840
I know you're joking, but I'm happy

02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:19.600
I get to live the life I do.

02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:20.760
And I think my mentor, Moore,

02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:23.120
I think the Stoics have it right.

02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.400
So you have it right in saying,

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:28.920
meditate on death enough to remember

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:31.440
that this ride ends pretty quickly

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:34.320
to help you appreciate every day

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.640
and the people you love, the people close to you

02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:39.280
and the cool shit that you're doing in your life,

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:40.800
the cool shit you're creating.

02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:44.200
And the fact that you, Mr. Thomas Tall,

02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.640
are playing with the motherfucking Rolling Stones tomorrow.

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.680
You are the man in so many disciplines,

02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:52.960
so respected, so successful.

02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:56.440
It's truly an honor that you sit down and talk with me today.

02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:59.760
Thomas, thank you so much for showing up in Texas

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:02.160
and for talking on this silly little podcast.

02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:03.000
It's great, man.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.320
I'm a huge fan of the show

02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:06.680
and have had a great time hanging with you

02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:09.240
and really appreciate it.

02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:12.000
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Thomas Tall.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.400

And now, let me leave you with some words

02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:21.320
from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones.

02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:23.480
You can't always get what you want,

02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:25.000
but if you try sometimes,

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.440
you might find you'll get what you need.

02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:29.320
Thank you for listening

02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:31.080
and hope to see you next time.
