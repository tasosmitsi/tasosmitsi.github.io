00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
What's your opinion on my bird here, Mr.

00:04.200 --> 00:04.600
Parrot?

00:04.840 --> 00:05.480
It's a macaw.

00:06.160 --> 00:06.920
Scarlet macaw.

00:07.720 --> 00:08.040
What?

00:08.600 --> 00:09.960
It is a scarlet macaw.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.240
Oh, you know birds.

00:11.560 --> 00:11.880
Yeah.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.160
And that's actually not life-sized.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.200
Are you saying he's not real?

00:17.720 --> 00:19.080
I'm saying it's not to scale.

00:19.400 --> 00:19.680
Okay.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.000
But he's real.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.240
Are we doing that Monty Python sketch?

00:25.120 --> 00:26.520
Everything is a Monty Python.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.000
I don't think Monty Python's funny.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.480
And I don't at all.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.920
That explains so much.

00:30.960 --> 00:31.400
Does it?

00:31.440 --> 00:32.160
What does it explain?

00:32.160 --> 00:33.040
What do you think is funny?

00:35.240 --> 00:36.400
You're not answering that question.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.120
It's pretty funny.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.000
Well, yeah.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.240
What do you think is funny?

00:39.880 --> 00:40.800
Having a mental shrimp?

00:41.520 --> 00:41.800
No.

00:42.480 --> 00:43.760
You think Big Lebowski is funny?

00:44.120 --> 00:44.840
Oh God, no.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.720
This is getting worse and worse.

00:50.320 --> 00:55.720
The following is a conversation with Michael Malus, anarchist and author of Dear

00:55.760 --> 01:01.640
Reader, The New Right, The Anarchist Handbook, The White Pill, and he is the

01:01.640 --> 01:04.240
host of the podcast, You're Welcome.

01:05.320 --> 01:10.480
This is a Thanksgiving special of the pirate and ocean going variety.

01:10.800 --> 01:15.880
So once again, let me say thank you for listening today and for being part

01:15.920 --> 01:17.640
of this wild journey with me.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.280
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.440
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:23.760 --> 01:27.240
And now dear friends, here's Michael Malus.

01:34.000 --> 01:34.560
The box?

01:34.960 --> 01:35.320
Yeah.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.040
The mystery box.

01:36.040 --> 01:36.560
I'm wondering what's in it.

01:36.720 --> 01:42.920
There's something in that box of exquisite beauty, both literally and in

01:42.920 --> 01:46.200
what it symbolizes and why it is here.

01:46.680 --> 01:51.720
Given the kind of human being you are, I'm terrified at what you find beautiful.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.240
That's a good point.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.200
You kind of hit me with the curve ball.

01:56.240 --> 01:56.520
Yeah.

01:56.920 --> 02:03.560
Like for me, the most beautiful, like wildlife are what I call God's mistakes.

02:04.360 --> 02:04.560
Yeah.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.200
Because my friend came up with that term where she's like, you know, God made

02:08.200 --> 02:10.320
these disgusting animals just threw in the bottom of the ocean.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.800
He's like, no one's ever going to see this.

02:11.880 --> 02:12.040
Yeah.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.320
You, uh, you commented on Twitter about some creature, like a rainbow type creature.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.600
The peacock mantis shrimp.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.000
Yeah.

02:19.120 --> 02:19.800
It's beautiful.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.160
It's horrific though.

02:21.440 --> 02:28.720
So it has, I think eight legs, six arms, two punching claws or spearing

02:28.720 --> 02:33.760
claws, depending on the genus, uh, two eyes, two antennae, two ear flaps.

02:33.760 --> 02:34.560
I don't know what they do.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.040
Um, and it's punch can be as strong as a bullet.

02:39.600 --> 02:44.160
And the other type with the spears divers call them thumb splitters because

02:44.160 --> 02:47.920
if you stick your finger near it, it'll cut your thumb down to the bone.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.160
So I had one as a pet all night.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.920
I would hear banging on the PVC pipe.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.480
And I've got to tell you, they have the best eyesight of any animal because

02:54.480 --> 02:55.640
they see in like seven different ways.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.400
And when you make eye contact with this thing, it's, it's just absolutely terrifying.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.320
But you can eat them as sushi.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.520
They call them sea centipedes.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.840
But they're colorful and beautiful.

03:03.160 --> 03:03.920
That species is.

03:03.920 --> 03:04.080
Yeah.

03:04.440 --> 03:09.120
What was it like having one as a pet and why did you do it?

03:09.440 --> 03:14.880
Well, when you have a species that's that unique and that much of an outlier,

03:15.600 --> 03:19.200
you know, growing up reading these books, watching these shows, I found this

03:19.200 --> 03:23.720
stuff so much more fascinating than like space and which is, you know, dead.

03:24.200 --> 03:28.400
Um, so to be able to have this specimen in your house and just observe its

03:28.400 --> 03:31.960
behavior, um, is just, just like an amazing thing.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.280
Why'd you get rid of it?

03:33.920 --> 03:36.640
I didn't have, I guess the right minerals in the mix.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.160
It died.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.600
It had a problem molting once.

03:38.640 --> 03:38.880
Yeah.

03:38.920 --> 03:39.840
They couldn't mold correctly.

03:40.360 --> 03:40.600
Wow.

03:41.360 --> 03:41.880
You miss it.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.200
Think about it still.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.840
I do think about it to be honest.

03:44.880 --> 03:50.200
I still have a pair of its, uh, punching, um, appendages from when it

03:50.200 --> 03:56.640
molted, what pet animal in your life do you miss the most that has been in

03:56.640 --> 03:59.360
your life that you think about?

03:59.840 --> 04:03.880
I've never had cats or dogs growing up or anything like that, which, you know,

04:03.880 --> 04:13.440
I, oh God, my problem is if I like something, I will go down a rabbit hole.

04:14.160 --> 04:14.400
Yeah.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.440
So I know if I got one tattoo, I already know my first five are going to be.

04:19.000 --> 04:19.440
Okay.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.800
So I can't do it.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.880
Cause then once I get those five, it's going to be a hundred and I'm

04:23.880 --> 04:25.840
already too old to be the tattoo guy.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.920
What would be the first tattoo?

04:27.400 --> 04:34.160
Um, my face, would it go on your ass cheeks or where would you put them?

04:34.720 --> 04:39.480
If it was my face, if I got your face, it would definitely be on my arm right here.

04:39.560 --> 04:43.040
If you had multiple faces, would you put like, I think delts, right?

04:43.040 --> 04:45.920
Shoulders, different faces and different shoulders symmetry.

04:46.280 --> 04:46.760
Yeah.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.080
Would you get a dictator?

04:49.000 --> 04:50.840
If you, if you had to get a dictator, who would you get?

04:50.880 --> 04:51.880
I'd be Kim Jong-il, right?

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
Cause I wrote the book on him.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.040
Oh, it's like the plugging your book.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.480
I don't think it's plugging.

04:57.480 --> 05:01.240
It's just like, I have a personal connection to this conversation.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.800
We would be asking why him and he'd be like, well, I wrote a book about it.

05:05.120 --> 05:06.680
Well, I'd be like, okay.

05:07.000 --> 05:07.320
Okay.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.000
Here's what, that would be a bad.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.160
No, that's not what happens.

05:10.320 --> 05:10.640
Okay.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.000
Here's the thing.

05:12.120 --> 05:12.840
What happens?

05:12.880 --> 05:16.080
When you write a book about North, Hey, nice to meet you.

05:16.080 --> 05:16.680
What is it you do?

05:16.680 --> 05:17.120
I'm an author.

05:17.120 --> 05:17.920
What kind of books do you write?

05:17.920 --> 05:24.200
Well, my last book was on North Korea, 90% of the time, 90, they will then start telling

05:24.200 --> 05:25.640
me everything they know about North Korea.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.320
And it's like, I don't need, this isn't a quiz and it's a very poorly understood country.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.760
I don't expect you to know anything.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.000
You're not on the spot.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.640
And, and half of what you're saying is not accurate either.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.240
It's fine.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.160
How often did they bring up Dennis Rodman?

05:38.480 --> 05:39.400
Uh, a hundred percent.

05:39.560 --> 05:40.280
A hundred percent of the time.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.880
Oh, so you don't, do you know Dennis Rodman?

05:41.920 --> 05:42.120
Yeah.

05:42.240 --> 05:46.880
But I don't understand what, I guess people feel the need to like, all right, like now

05:46.880 --> 05:47.960
we're talking about this subject.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.640
I just got to, you know, drop whatever I can talk about.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.760
It's usually a small amount.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.840
And there's this thing in the culture, which I hate, that everyone have to have an

05:55.840 --> 05:56.800
opinion on everything.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.600
And it's like, it's okay to be like, yeah, I don't know anything about that.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.080
Tell me more.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.640
You know, there's lots of things I don't know anything about.

06:02.680 --> 06:06.880
What's your opinion on my bird here, Mr.

06:06.880 --> 06:07.280
Parrot?

06:07.520 --> 06:09.600
It's a macaw, Scarlet macaw.

06:10.400 --> 06:10.720
What?

06:11.320 --> 06:12.680
It is a Scarlet macaw.

06:13.000 --> 06:13.960
Oh, you know, birds.

06:14.280 --> 06:14.600
Yeah.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.880
And that's actually not life-sized.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.920
Are you saying he's not real?

06:20.440 --> 06:21.800
I'm saying it's not to scale.

06:22.120 --> 06:22.400
Okay.

06:22.640 --> 06:23.720
But he's real.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.960
Are we doing that Monty Python sketch?

06:27.840 --> 06:29.240
Everything is a Monty Python.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.720
I don't think Monty Python's funny.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.200
And you don't at all.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.720
Like that explains so much.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.200
Does it?

06:34.240 --> 06:34.920
What does it explain?

06:34.960 --> 06:35.840
What do you think is funny?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.200
You're not answering that question.

06:39.200 --> 06:39.920
It's pretty funny.

06:40.480 --> 06:40.760
Well, yeah.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.960
What do you think is funny?

06:42.640 --> 06:43.560
Having a Menta shrimp?

06:44.240 --> 06:44.560
No.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.520
Do you think Big Lebowski is funny?

06:46.880 --> 06:47.600
Oh God, no.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.440
Although this is getting worse and worse.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.360
To be fair.

06:51.440 --> 06:51.720
Yep.

06:52.600 --> 06:57.320
I only tried to watch Big Lebowski after it's been part of the culture for many

06:57.320 --> 07:03.480
years, to the point where every single line has been quoted incessantly by the

07:03.480 --> 07:05.800
most annoying frat bros ever.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.160
Yeah.

07:06.240 --> 07:10.120
So I kind of have been poisoned to be able to appreciate it.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.760
So maybe if I'd seen it when it came out, before it became a thing, I would have

07:14.760 --> 07:15.240
enjoyed it.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.080
I couldn't get through it.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.440
Like I couldn't get through 20 minutes.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.440
Is that how you feel about Schindler's List?

07:20.920 --> 07:24.200
Well, it's so much easier for me to stare at you when you have sunglasses on.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.440
I didn't think you'd be the one making Holocaust jokes today.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.000
And yet here we are.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.360
And cut scene.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.560
I actually have like no trouble making eye contact with you when you're wearing

07:34.560 --> 07:35.000
shades.

07:35.240 --> 07:35.720
Yes.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.560
Cause you're a robot.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.440
Two copies of myself.

07:38.480 --> 07:38.720
Yeah.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.680
Oh, you're seeing yourself in them?

07:39.760 --> 07:40.040
Mm-hmm.

07:40.160 --> 07:40.400
Okay.

07:40.400 --> 07:40.640
Cool.

07:40.640 --> 07:40.720
Yeah.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.680
I'm having a conversation with myself.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.440
It's not your fault, Lex.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.160
They made you like this.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.160
You were just a good little robot in St.

07:50.160 --> 07:50.680
Petersburg.

07:51.560 --> 07:52.240
I could see Mr.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.320
Parrot a little bit too.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.280
Well, what do you find funny?

07:55.280 --> 07:55.560
Come on.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.200
This is an interesting subject.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.760
Well, I find Mighty Python.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.440
I find absurdity funny.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.000
Yes, I find absurdity funny.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.120
I think that's the thing.

08:03.120 --> 08:08.720
When people come at me and maybe this is an Eastern European thing, when they're

08:08.720 --> 08:11.680
like, how can you find this like very dark subject funny?

08:12.200 --> 08:17.040
It's like, well, the humor, first of all, the humor is that you're making fun of

08:17.040 --> 08:17.960
something that's dark.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.160
So already it's absurd.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.440
Like it's completely inappropriate.

08:20.840 --> 08:25.840
Second, just psychologically, you know, Joan Rivers said that Winston Churchill

08:25.840 --> 08:28.520
said, I don't know if it's true, that when you make people laugh, you're giving

08:28.520 --> 08:29.360
them a little vacation.

08:30.120 --> 08:35.880
And I was just thinking about this the other day, how when I die, if I want my

08:35.880 --> 08:39.800
funeral to be a roast, it doesn't help me that everyone's sad.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.800
If I brought people happiness or joy in life, whatever, I want to keep doing that

08:44.800 --> 08:45.160
in death.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.560
Your sadness doesn't help me.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.760
I know you can't help it, but tell stories of how it made you laugh.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.400
Make fun of me, make me the punching bag, even literally take me out of that

08:54.400 --> 08:56.520
coffin and make me a pinata.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.280
I don't care.

08:57.800 --> 09:02.800
So I think, and it's, it's, I don't understand why I do understand, but it's

09:02.840 --> 09:07.240
sad for me when people are like, you know, this isn't funny.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.000
That isn't funny.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.920
I feel the way I look at humor is the way it's like a chef, right?

09:12.280 --> 09:16.440
It's pretty easy to make bacon taste good with some of these really obscure

09:16.440 --> 09:18.360
ingredients to make it palatable.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.680
That's takes skill.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.880
So if you're dealing with a subject that is very emotional or intense and you

09:23.880 --> 09:27.720
could make people laugh, then that takes skill.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.280
And that's the relief for them.

09:29.840 --> 09:30.120
Yeah.

09:31.760 --> 09:32.640
It's all about timing.

09:33.320 --> 09:33.720
Yeah.

09:34.320 --> 09:34.640
Yeah.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.440
What's the different, you want to hear one of my jokes?

09:41.560 --> 09:42.520
Is it a pirate joke?

09:42.720 --> 09:46.040
Cause that's the only, that's the only kind I accept today, but then go ahead.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.280
It doesn't have to be a pirate joke.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.080
This one time.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.600
Do you know who Leah Thomas is?

09:50.280 --> 09:50.640
Yeah.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.920
What's there between Leah Thomas and Hitler?

09:53.400 --> 09:54.000
What?

09:54.480 --> 09:56.280
Leah Thomas knows how to finish a race.

09:58.040 --> 09:58.600
Very nice.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.160
Very nice.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.400
Did I just get the gold medal?

10:00.800 --> 10:01.320
Good job.

10:01.960 --> 10:08.000
Well, why does it take pirates forever to get through the alphabet?

10:09.520 --> 10:10.000
Why?

10:11.080 --> 10:12.840
Cause they spent years at sea.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.880
Oh, I thought it was going to be an R joke.

10:15.960 --> 10:16.600
That's a good one.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.200
I like that.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.280
When I was in North Korea.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.040
Oh, you know, Dennis Rodman.

10:22.960 --> 10:23.640
It's a callback.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.920
By the way, the thing that is very heartbreaking about the North Korean

10:26.920 --> 10:29.240
situation is that they have a great sense of humor.

10:30.040 --> 10:35.200
It would be a lot easier if these were like robots or drones.

10:35.600 --> 10:41.520
They have big personalities, big sense of humor, and that made it much harder to

10:41.520 --> 10:43.280
leave and interact with these people.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.440
Cause it's, I mean, there's nothing more human and universal than laughter

10:46.440 --> 10:47.160
and laughter is free.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.800
Are you saying there's humor even amongst the people that have most of

10:50.800 --> 10:51.680
their freedoms taken away?

10:51.920 --> 10:52.640
Especially.

10:52.640 --> 10:57.200
I mean, again, we're from, you know, the Soviet Union, like there's a, I mean,

10:57.200 --> 11:01.240
Russian humor is a thing because there's nothing you can, this, if you can't have

11:01.240 --> 11:04.360
food or nice things, at least you can have joy and make each other laugh.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.760
I think about it all the time.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.960
And I think about my guide all the time.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.720
It's been what, uh, 2012.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.000
So it's been 11 years since I've been there and she's still there.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.200
And everyone I've seen is still there.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.760
They just recently, um, electrified the border.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.160
Uh, so you can't even, even the few people who are escaping can't do it anymore.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.560
Well, that's interesting that they still have a sense of humor.

11:21.560 --> 11:25.480
I attribute the Soviet Union for having that because of the, uh, like really

11:25.480 --> 11:30.880
deep education system, like you got to read a lot of literature and because of

11:30.880 --> 11:39.200
that you get to kind of learn about the, the cruelty, the injustices, the absurdity

11:39.200 --> 11:42.680
of the world, as long as the writing is not about the current regime.

11:43.200 --> 11:43.360
Yeah.

11:43.360 --> 11:46.880
But I think like, if you look at like African-Americans, Jewish Americans,

11:46.880 --> 11:50.120
gay Americans, they are all disproportionate in terms of

11:50.120 --> 11:51.200
contributing to comedy.

11:51.480 --> 11:55.640
It's not because these groups have some kind of, you know, magic to them.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.880
It's that when you are on the outside looking in, a, you're going to have

11:58.880 --> 12:01.440
different perspective than the people who are in the middle of the bell curve.

12:01.840 --> 12:06.160
But also when you don't have anything to lose at the very least, you can make

12:06.160 --> 12:07.960
each other laugh and find happiness that way.

12:08.440 --> 12:13.160
Um, so, you know, that is something that I think, um, is

12:13.160 --> 12:14.320
an important thing to recognize.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.720
So what do you find funny?

12:16.680 --> 12:23.760
What makes you giggle like in the most joyful of ways, the suffering of others?

12:24.000 --> 12:32.480
I mean, I, there are, um, YouTube videos of, uh, of like fat people

12:32.480 --> 12:35.880
falling down and they're, they're really funny.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.520
There's two kinds of people in this world.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.120
Those that laugh at those videos and those that don't.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.280
No, and those that are in them.

12:43.280 --> 12:48.200
Um, my friend Jesse just told me a great Norm Macdonald joke, and this is a good

12:48.200 --> 12:53.240
litmus test joke, cause he says a certain group of people lose their minds and a

12:53.240 --> 12:56.800
certain group of people just stare at you and he goes, this kind of, so I'll

12:56.800 --> 13:01.440
tell you the joke, this is Norm Macdonald guy walks into a bar and he sees someone

13:01.440 --> 13:06.520
at the bar who has a big pumpkin for a head and the guy's like, dude, what happened

13:06.520 --> 13:06.720
to you?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.240
He goes, oh, you never believe this.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.880
I got one of those genie lamps and I just, you know, I was like,

13:12.840 --> 13:14.680
and I, this genie, he's like, wait, what happened?

13:14.680 --> 13:18.480
He goes, well, the first wish, you know, I wish for a hundred million dollars.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.160
He's like, yeah, do you get it?

13:19.160 --> 13:21.560
He goes, yeah, he goes in my bank account, feels fine.

13:21.560 --> 13:22.320
He goes, all right.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.880
Well, the second wish I wish to have sex with as many beautiful women as I want.

13:25.880 --> 13:26.880
He goes, did that happen?

13:26.880 --> 13:27.960
He goes, yeah, it was amazing.

13:28.200 --> 13:28.960
He goes, then what?

13:29.200 --> 13:30.640
Well, I wish for a giant pumpkin head.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.760
So there's a certain mindset that will just be staring at the screen.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.240
And that is, I mean, there's so many levels why that's funny, at least to me.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.240
And I just love that kind of.

13:45.240 --> 13:49.360
Well, Norm MacDonald is like, uh, just, I watch his videos all the time.

13:49.360 --> 13:53.960
He's, he's a guy that definitely makes me giggle and he's one of the people that

13:55.120 --> 13:57.320
makes me giggle for reasons I don't quite understand.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.560
Did you ever see him with Carrot Top on, um, Conan O'Brien?

14:01.800 --> 14:02.080
No.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.560
Of making fun of Carrot Top?

14:03.880 --> 14:04.120
No.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.080
He, this is probably the best talk show clip of all time.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.240
He's on with Courtney Thorne-Smith.

14:10.240 --> 14:14.440
She was on Melrose Place and Conan O'Brien is the host and Courtney's talking about

14:14.440 --> 14:20.800
how she's going to be an upcoming movie with Carrot Top and Conan is like, oh,

14:21.120 --> 14:22.120
what's it going to be called?

14:22.120 --> 14:24.320
And she's like, doesn't have a title yet.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.160
And Norm goes, oh, I know what it should be called.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.480
Box office poisoned.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.280
And they're all laughing and she's like, no, no, no.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.680
Like the working title is Chairman of the Board.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.760
And Conan goes, do something with that smart ass.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.080
And Norm goes, yeah, board is spelled B-O-R-E-D.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.280
And they all just completely lost it.

14:39.680 --> 14:44.000
There's something about him with words spoken out of his mouth with the way he

14:44.000 --> 14:46.040
like turns his head and looks at the camera.

14:46.320 --> 14:52.200
I think he is one of those rare comedians who you really feel like

14:52.200 --> 14:53.360
he's talking to you directly.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.680
He feels like he's winking at you in the audience.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.960
And he's like, can you, can you believe I'm doing this?

14:58.960 --> 15:02.520
Like it's, it's like he almost, he feels like he's, I don't want to say

15:02.520 --> 15:05.680
imposter, but like he's more a member of the audience than he is a member

15:05.680 --> 15:06.720
of the people on the stage.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.000
Yeah.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.920
It feels like he's on our side, whatever the hell our means.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.360
You know, Roseanne got him his first job.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.440
Roseanne, you and her have been hanging out.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.480
I got it.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.200
Oh my God.

15:18.600 --> 15:19.520
Talk about Thanksgiving.

15:19.600 --> 15:25.200
Um, when you are talking to Roseanne Barr and making eye contact with this

15:25.200 --> 15:28.560
person, it is, I can't even describe it.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.560
It's just like, holy crap, Roseanne Barr is talking to me.

15:30.760 --> 15:35.520
She is, I've said this to her face, pathologically funny.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.320
Like it does not turn off and you're sitting there and you're like, holy crap.

15:40.360 --> 15:43.880
And when you make her laugh, which is that laugh, it's in the theme song of her

15:43.880 --> 15:46.800
show, you feel like, okay, I did a mitzvah.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.720
I did something good and right in the world that I made Roseanne Barr laugh.

15:50.200 --> 15:54.720
Um, and it's also really funny because, and she's going to hate this because I

15:54.720 --> 15:55.640
tell her she's adorable.

15:55.640 --> 15:56.280
She isn't like that.

15:56.520 --> 15:57.440
She's little.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.440
You think of Roseanne Barr as this like force of nature, like a tsunami.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.280
She's like five, three, I'd say like maybe one 30.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.520
Like, and she's just, and she puts on the sunglasses.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.600
You think this little Jewish lady, you'd never know.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.840
This is one of the most epic performers of all time.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.920
She lives near here now.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.120
So it's just so much fun talking to her.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.200
There was an old satirical magazine in the, I think like, uh, early

16:20.200 --> 16:23.240
two thousands called Hebe written, written by Jews.

16:24.160 --> 16:28.360
And she dressed up as Hitler for one of the photo shoots and she was

16:28.360 --> 16:30.240
baking little men in the oven.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.320
I got, I found it on eBay.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.280
I want her to sign it to Michael.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.360
It should have been you, but she signed it to Michael.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.520
You're one smart cookie.

16:38.960 --> 16:43.480
And now it hangs love mom, Roseanne Barr and I call her mom and it hangs over

16:43.480 --> 16:47.640
my desk because I have her like good domestic goddess energy flowing at me.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.040
What, what do you find?

16:53.080 --> 16:53.480
What else?

16:53.520 --> 16:57.560
So Norm MacDonald, we agree on something.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.320
My favorite comedian of all time is Neil Hamburger.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.960
So Neil Hamburger, I don't know if I'm ruining the bit.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.960
He's a character, uh, performed by this guy named Greg Turkington.

17:09.600 --> 17:16.800
So he comes out in a tuxedo, big eyeglasses, holding three glasses

17:16.800 --> 17:19.920
of water, coughing into the mic.

17:21.120 --> 17:26.760
And I remember I saw him once in, um, LA and the girl ahead of me at the

17:26.760 --> 17:29.800
table ahead of me was with her boyfriend, this basic chick, pumpkin spice.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.240
She turns to him and she goes, what is this?

17:32.800 --> 17:37.360
And I remember the first time he was on Jimmy Kimmel and he tells one of his

17:37.360 --> 17:42.760
jokes and it was like, um, uh, why does ET like Reese's pieces so much?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.440
Well, that's what sperm tastes like in his home planet.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.440
And like, no one laughs and he goes, Oh, come on guys, I have cancer.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.320
And it just cuts to this Marine of the audience with his arms crossed.

17:54.920 --> 17:58.760
Um, so if you know what he's doing, it's just absolutely amazing.

17:58.760 --> 18:04.480
He opened for Tenacious D once in, uh, somewhere, I think in Ireland or the UK,

18:04.480 --> 18:09.200
one of those, and they're booing him because his jokes are often not funny.

18:09.200 --> 18:15.200
He's like, Hey, where did my, uh, whore ex-wife run off to with that dentist

18:15.200 --> 18:16.200
she's shacking up with?

18:16.600 --> 18:19.680
I don't know, but when I see her in court next month, Alaska.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.360
So they're booing and he goes, all right, do you guys want me to bring out Tenacious D?

18:24.680 --> 18:25.400
They're like, yeah.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.400
Do you want to see your heroes of mine Tenacious D?

18:27.400 --> 18:27.760
Yeah.

18:28.040 --> 18:28.800
Come on, let me hear it.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
Do you want to see Tenacious D?

18:29.800 --> 18:29.920
Yeah.

18:29.920 --> 18:30.760
He goes, all right.

18:31.840 --> 18:37.600
Uh, if I tell this next joke and you don't boo me, I'll bring out Tenacious D.

18:38.240 --> 18:43.160
And it's like, uh, um, I'm trying to think of one that's not too, uh, um.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.520
Self-censorship is never good.

18:45.520 --> 18:45.920
Okay.

18:46.080 --> 18:51.360
He goes, um, can we agree that George Bush is the worst president

18:51.360 --> 18:52.400
of America has ever had?

18:52.400 --> 18:55.760
And from claps, he goes, which makes it all the stranger that his son, George

18:55.800 --> 18:57.640
W Bush was in fact the best.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.600
I take it back in the self-censorship.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.680
So two people laugh and he goes, oh, that's amazing.

19:04.720 --> 19:05.920
I guess I'll do an encore.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.080
And he did 10 more minutes.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.560
It was just, just like, I love him so much.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.440
It's interesting.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.720
They opened for Tenacious D.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.040
Jack Black.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.720
That's a comedic genius of a different kind.

19:16.040 --> 19:16.400
Oh yeah.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.840
And he was in one of my favorite movies, uh, Jesus son.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.000
It's this little indie movie.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.800
Um, he did a great turn in that.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.440
He's really underrated as an actor.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.360
He's got a lot of range.

19:24.360 --> 19:28.240
Like I know they kind of kind of get types cast as this kind of one specific type,

19:28.640 --> 19:30.240
but he's really, really talented.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.400
But also just like the pure joy.

19:32.520 --> 19:32.880
Yes.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.200
He's clearly having fun.

19:35.240 --> 19:35.720
Okay.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.400
Uh, it is Thanksgiving.

19:37.680 --> 19:44.000
So in a tradition, following tradition, what are you thankful for?

19:44.040 --> 19:44.480
Michael?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.200
I got a, do you have a list too?

19:46.640 --> 19:47.520
No, not really.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.200
Really?

19:48.280 --> 19:49.000
It's up in here.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.800
Oh, I mean, but you have several things you're thankful for.

19:51.800 --> 19:52.160
Yes.

19:52.200 --> 19:52.480
Okay.

19:52.480 --> 19:52.880
Yes.

19:53.040 --> 19:55.080
One of the things I, my list comes from the heart.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.360
I don't have to write anything down.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.400
Well, I don't have written down.

19:57.520 --> 19:57.840
Okay.

19:58.160 --> 20:02.320
One of the things that I'm most thankful for, this is a common answer, but I can

20:02.320 --> 20:11.240
back it up is my family because my nephew Lucas is now six years old and he, when

20:11.240 --> 20:15.160
kids have a sense of humor, it's like just miraculous.

20:15.480 --> 20:22.360
So he stole my sister's phone, his mom figured out that grandma is listed as mom

20:22.360 --> 20:26.640
in the phone and he calls her up and he's like, Michael's in the hospital.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.280
He's really sick.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.200
He didn't want to tell you and she's freaking out.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.240
He goes prank.

20:30.600 --> 20:35.200
So I took him, uh, Dinesh D'Souza just released a movie called police state,

20:35.200 --> 20:37.080
which was actually really good, um, highly recommended.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.960
I was surprised how much I liked it there because he wasn't going

20:39.960 --> 20:41.360
Republicans, good Democrats bad.

20:41.360 --> 20:46.760
It was just about authoritarianism and he had a movie premiere Mar-a-Lago.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.760
So I'm like, I got to bring Lucas to Mar-a-Lago.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.760
So Lucas is, I'm like, we're going to the president's house.

20:52.760 --> 20:53.800
He's like, Oh, the white house.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.760
And I'm like, no, no, like a former president goes, Oh, Abe Lincoln.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.200
And I'm like, okay, kid logic.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.040
Like he's, he's giving logical answers.

21:00.040 --> 21:00.840
This is kind of like AI.

21:00.840 --> 21:04.080
You have to, you have to program it to it's using logic correctly.

21:04.600 --> 21:10.200
You should have told him as a president, that's second to only Abe Lincoln

21:10.640 --> 21:12.360
in terms of accomplishments.

21:12.400 --> 21:12.600
Yeah.

21:13.440 --> 21:19.320
Um, he, uh, went up to all the women in their ball gown, you know, evening

21:19.320 --> 21:22.440
gowns and he goes, you're so beautiful.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.080
Were you born as a girl?

21:24.560 --> 21:28.360
So when you have this six year old asking you this, it was really, really fun.

21:28.680 --> 21:33.640
Um, so that is a great joy to have a nephew and I have another one, Zach,

21:33.640 --> 21:38.360
who's coming up, uh, in age and he's starting to talk now that is really,

21:38.400 --> 21:43.400
really fun getting to watch them, you know, find out about the world for

21:43.400 --> 21:44.800
the first time and also training them.

21:45.040 --> 21:49.400
Like that he, he wants, he loves being funny and having fun for your,

21:49.400 --> 21:51.800
your audience in a sense.

21:51.840 --> 21:55.920
Yeah, but you giggle and we're prank bros.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.960
It gives me a high five, my family.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.760
And this is one, you talk about what I find funny.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.640
This is the things that actually enrage me when people, and this is such a wasp

22:04.640 --> 22:07.880
thing, don't just go with the joke or they're like, I don't get it.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.840
Or they don't understand to just go with it.

22:10.280 --> 22:15.240
I was in the car with my sister when she was like 10, 12, whatever.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.000
She's much younger than me.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.800
She's like 12 years younger.

22:17.600 --> 22:22.320
And there's this species of squid, by the way, which is asymmetric.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.240
One of its eyes is very much bigger than the other because it swims

22:25.240 --> 22:26.760
horizontally and so one's looking up.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.360
One's looking down with this more light.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.000
Uh, shout out, if you want to learn more about squids, go to octonation.com.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.360
Octonation, shout out to Warren.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.760
There's a lot of fascinating stuff.

22:35.800 --> 22:36.920
Octonation on Instagram.

22:37.040 --> 22:37.440
Yes.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.880
Um, I was in the car with my sister.

22:39.880 --> 22:40.520
She's like 10 or 12.

22:40.520 --> 22:43.320
Me as a pirate, I don't, I'm sorry for the rude interruptions.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.160
I appreciate that.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.040
I count, especially.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.520
Yeah, it's a great, yeah.

22:46.720 --> 22:51.000
These jokes and thoughts are coming to me at a, like a 10 second delay.

22:51.000 --> 22:51.760
So I apologize.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.040
Anyway, you were telling about the asymmetrical, all right.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.160
Um, so I told my, sometimes you need help.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.600
No, the age is getting too.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.160
I was, uh, your skin is showing it.

23:04.880 --> 23:05.800
It's getting dark.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.880
I told my sister, I go, when you were born, um, one of your eyes was bigger

23:10.880 --> 23:12.880
than the other and you had to have surgery to fix it.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.320
So she turned, she's like, mom.

23:15.720 --> 23:20.840
And my mom goes, honey, the important thing is that you're beautiful now.

23:20.840 --> 23:21.280
That's all.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.240
It's like, what's the big deal?

23:22.240 --> 23:23.200
It was just a little surgery.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.040
Am I says like, all right.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.080
Calls grandma and grandma goes.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.480
Uh, she goes, Michael said that I was born one of the eyes.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.320
She goes, why is he telling you this now?

23:32.320 --> 23:33.080
It's not a big deal.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.400
You weren't at the fact that everyone went with this.

23:35.480 --> 23:37.440
Oh, was I was so impressed.

23:37.440 --> 23:41.040
I was like, this is a quality family in this very specific regard.

23:41.080 --> 23:41.320
Yeah.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.680
Does your family have a sense of humor?

23:43.120 --> 23:45.080
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:45.520 --> 23:45.880
Yeah.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.880
You know, Soviet culture, there's like a dark sense of humor.

23:49.960 --> 23:50.360
Very much.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.520
There's a word play word play.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.000
Uh, yeah, yeah.

23:56.040 --> 24:00.400
And especially the Russian language allows for some like, um, hilarity to it.

24:00.600 --> 24:07.240
There's also a culture of like poetry and like, um, my dad, my mom too, but they,

24:07.240 --> 24:11.960
they remember a lot of lines from books and poems.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.680
So there's just, you can do a lot of fascinating references that add to the

24:15.680 --> 24:20.840
humor and the richness of the, of the, of the very Russian thing, like at a party

24:20.840 --> 24:22.880
or maybe at a bar or something, I don't know where you'd meet people.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.240
These are such great.

24:25.280 --> 24:29.840
I meant in Russia, I meant these would be such good icebreakers, right?

24:29.840 --> 24:31.440
You go up to someone and goes, Hey, do you hear this one?

24:31.640 --> 24:32.680
No, no, no of anecdote.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.560
And you just tell him some little story.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.560
Did you say icebreakers?

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
Cause it's cold in Russia.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.320
I'm here all night.

24:41.960 --> 24:46.560
That's literally, I feel like that's the thing.

24:47.160 --> 24:47.440
Yeah.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.240
And that's not a thing in America.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.960
Uh, you mean like witty banter?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.680
No, meaning you go up to a stranger and like, that's your icebreaker.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.200
You tell them this little, little joke.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.720
And since everyone kind of has the same sensibilities, right away, you

24:59.720 --> 25:00.400
guys are chatting.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.640
I don't think that's a thing here.

25:01.960 --> 25:02.320
Yeah.

25:02.360 --> 25:02.800
Thing here.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.680
It's more small talk, which drives me crazy.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.400
So what else are you thankful for?

25:06.760 --> 25:08.520
Well, what am I, what's something you're thankful for?

25:09.160 --> 25:10.400
Well, you went with family.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.080
I'm definitely thankful for family.

25:12.120 --> 25:12.480
Okay.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.120
Yeah.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.800
How, if I may ask, how do they react to you?

25:16.800 --> 25:19.760
Like you're sitting down with Ilan, you're sitting down with Netanyahu, you're

25:19.760 --> 25:23.640
sitting down with all these like big, with Kanye, all these big names.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.160
Are they expressing that they're proud of you or is it more like, why haven't

25:28.160 --> 25:29.200
you talked to this person?

25:30.240 --> 25:30.480
Yeah.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.240
More Michael Malice, please.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.840
People's choice.

25:36.200 --> 25:36.600
Yeah.

25:36.600 --> 25:36.840
Yeah.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.800
They're, they're very proud.

25:37.880 --> 25:41.480
They've been very, they're very, I mean, but they get argumentative and we just,

25:41.760 --> 25:45.320
they're just like a regular human being with whom I'm close.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.480
And we just argue about stuff.

25:46.480 --> 25:52.560
They're not, maybe not enough showed up being proud of, but that, that part is

25:52.560 --> 25:54.920
just the nature of our relationship.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.280
It's also Soviet parents.

25:56.320 --> 25:56.480
Yeah.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.440
I don't talk to my dad.

25:57.440 --> 26:04.360
That's one of the reasons because there's never ever any good job.

26:04.960 --> 26:10.680
And at a certain point, it's like, why am I trying to search for approval from

26:10.680 --> 26:13.320
someone I'm never getting, get it for, and from who it wouldn't mean anything

26:13.320 --> 26:14.040
at this point anyway.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.160
Well, that's interesting.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.640
I mean, there's a journey like that for a lot of people with their father or

26:18.640 --> 26:24.320
with their mother, like they're always trying to find approval and that's life.

26:24.480 --> 26:30.000
For a lot of people, that's, that's a really big part of the human condition

26:30.000 --> 26:32.480
is that relationship you have with your father, with your mother.

26:32.560 --> 26:32.840
I don't know.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.680
It's a beautiful thing.

26:33.680 --> 26:37.640
So it's, whether it's been a rough childhood or a beautiful one, all of it.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.760
That's who you are.

26:38.920 --> 26:44.800
Like that, the relationship, especially early on in your life with your father,

26:44.800 --> 26:47.600
with your mother is like extremely formative.

26:48.080 --> 26:48.360
Yeah.

26:48.360 --> 26:53.120
So my dad taught me a lot of things at a young age that I'm very, very grateful

26:53.120 --> 26:58.680
for, uh, he was, he's extremely intelligent, very flawed and that's fine.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.840
We all are, um, except for me.

27:01.160 --> 27:05.560
Um, and it's the kind of things that when you learn things that are right, a, and

27:05.560 --> 27:08.720
this is one of the things I like about being older is that when I'm friends,

27:08.720 --> 27:13.160
much older, much older, but much, much older, when I have friends who are

27:13.160 --> 27:17.960
younger, it's very easy for me to keep them from making the mistakes I did.

27:18.240 --> 27:21.120
So at least this is something I'm getting out of it is that, okay, I

27:21.120 --> 27:25.680
can't fix these mistakes, but it just takes me 30 seconds and I can pull

27:25.680 --> 27:27.080
you back from making the mistake.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.840
So he taught me a lot as a kid.

27:29.160 --> 27:33.120
He really encouraged me very much to, he's a very good sense of humor

27:33.120 --> 27:37.520
and also very bad in some ways, um, dad jokes, but also really funny jokes.

27:37.880 --> 27:42.520
But also this love of learning, uh, that I got that from him.

27:42.560 --> 27:47.360
And I mean, I, I have got literally right now, 98 books on my shelf to read.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.520
It's just a life that makes me.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.440
I remember I had a friend and she ran into someone she went to high school with

27:53.440 --> 27:56.400
and he stopped you on the train and he's like, yo, you're not in college.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.520
You don't need to read books anymore.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.880
And I was just like, horrified to hear this.

28:00.200 --> 28:00.560
Yeah.

28:01.360 --> 28:01.720
Yeah.

28:02.560 --> 28:03.560
Boy, don't I know it.

28:04.480 --> 28:10.640
I mean, I mean, I, I, you do laugh, but like, I, when you got, there's a

28:10.640 --> 28:15.840
lot of things I don't understand when you got heat for like, I want to read

28:15.920 --> 28:19.120
the Western classics to me that that might've been like the internet.

28:19.120 --> 28:19.960
That's absolute worst.

28:21.080 --> 28:24.000
I think, I think there's just a cynical perspective.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.880
You can take the term.

28:25.480 --> 28:29.000
This is such a simple celebration of a thing that there

28:29.000 --> 28:30.120
must be something behind it.

28:30.840 --> 28:34.320
I think the internet for good and bad is just skeptical.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.240
Like what's behind this?

28:36.320 --> 28:37.640
My hero, Albert Camus.

28:38.160 --> 28:42.760
And if there's one thing I would want to fight it's cynicism because it's such

28:42.760 --> 28:46.160
a giving up, it's such, everything sucks.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.080
This sucks.

28:47.080 --> 28:47.880
That's like, this sucks.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.120
Most things suck.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.680
Most standard comedians suck.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.680
Most movies suck.

28:51.760 --> 28:52.720
All podcasts suck.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.400
Um, but it doesn't matter, especially mine.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.960
It's, it's unwatchable.

28:57.960 --> 28:58.640
You're welcome.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.000
We can't even spell it correctly.

29:02.440 --> 29:06.440
Um, but the stuff that's good is what matters.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.120
There were, who cares if 90% of movies are terrible.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.160
Like they're the ones that change your life.

29:12.680 --> 29:16.720
The books, the people, the comedians, the shows, the music.

29:17.800 --> 29:21.080
And even the terrible things have good moments.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.000
Beautiful moments.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.160
Some, not all.

29:23.680 --> 29:26.600
Your podcast being an example of not all.

29:27.320 --> 29:31.600
I've literally just, I keep listening for something good, something good.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.280
In all fairness, none of my guests have anything to offer.

29:36.000 --> 29:36.680
It's not on me.

29:36.680 --> 29:37.240
I try.

29:37.440 --> 29:37.840
Yeah.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.640
Well, I wish you'd talk a little less in your podcast.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.200
It's a little excessive.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.000
I only listen for the underwear commercials.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.240
She's thundera.com.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.200
Probably called Malice.

29:48.360 --> 29:52.720
I think you did this, um, uh, I haven't seen you do it in a while, but this kind

29:52.720 --> 29:59.120
of commentary on a, on a debate or, um, I think it was with Rand, like an

29:59.120 --> 30:00.000
Ayn Rand debate or something like this.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.400
Oh yeah.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.320
Malice at the movies.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.400
I watched the video and I broke it down.

30:03.440 --> 30:03.720
Yeah.

30:03.720 --> 30:04.040
That was really great.

30:04.040 --> 30:04.880
I wish you did that more.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.680
I've, I haven't done live streaming in a long time.

30:08.560 --> 30:12.120
I, it was something I was doing a lot in New York, especially during COVID.

30:12.800 --> 30:15.760
I feel that, um, I don't know.

30:15.760 --> 30:19.040
I'm having, I got so many projects on the plate.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.960
Uh, I'm, oh, this is something else I'm thankful for.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.160
This is something I'm very, very thankful for.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.280
And I'm going to announce it here.

30:26.640 --> 30:27.520
Coming out of the closet.

30:27.520 --> 30:27.960
Finally.

30:28.000 --> 30:28.360
Go ahead.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.640
Who's the lucky guy?

30:37.920 --> 30:38.800
You're the one in drag.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.600
He makes me, he makes me call him sex Fridman.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.560
Uh, you like it.

30:49.840 --> 30:58.160
So I didn't say it didn't even imply that when I in, as you probably know, as

30:58.160 --> 31:01.560
you know, but as many people watching this also know, uh, Harvey P.

31:01.560 --> 31:06.280
Carr, who had the comic book series, American Splendor was the subject of

31:06.280 --> 31:07.400
the movie, American Splendor.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.200
He wrote a graphic novel about me in 2006 called ego and hubris, which

31:11.200 --> 31:13.400
goes for like $150 on eBay.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.040
It's not worth it.

31:14.040 --> 31:14.720
Just download it.

31:15.640 --> 31:21.800
And I met Harvey because I wrote this screenplay about this band from

31:21.800 --> 31:23.720
the eighties called rubber rodeo.

31:23.800 --> 31:27.560
It's a real band and the keyboardist, Gary Lieb who passed away, rest in

31:27.560 --> 31:31.600
peace, Gary introduced me to Harvey cause he did the animation for the movie.

31:32.440 --> 31:36.200
And the scripts been in my desk for over 20 years.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.880
And I realized, uh, thanks to my buddy, Eric July, who has some huge

31:39.880 --> 31:43.200
success with his comics, I could just produce this as a graphic novel.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.360
So I've got an artist, we're getting it together.

31:46.400 --> 31:48.040
So I'm going to make it happen finally.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.960
And it's some of the best writing I've ever done.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.200
I'm really proud of the story.

31:51.960 --> 31:56.280
It's kind of ironic reading it now because when you're a writer, obviously

31:56.280 --> 31:59.440
you're different books, you put different aspects of yourself into them.

31:59.560 --> 31:59.880
Right.

32:00.440 --> 32:05.280
And this story is very, very dark because basically they did all the

32:05.280 --> 32:06.600
right things and they went nowhere.

32:07.200 --> 32:07.600
Right.

32:07.920 --> 32:13.160
What I realized was reading it now that all these fears I had over 20 years

32:13.160 --> 32:16.760
ago about what if I'm not going to make it, what if, you know, I'm doing all

32:16.760 --> 32:18.400
the hard work and it's still not enough.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.280
Uh, now it's been disproven cause I can at least pay my rent.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.840
You feel like you've made it.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.160
So you said you could pay your rent.

32:26.560 --> 32:33.200
I feel that to make it is if you can pay your, if you don't have to have a boss.

32:34.240 --> 32:36.200
And you know how I really felt like I made it?

32:37.040 --> 32:40.360
This is going to sound like a joke and it's not, uh, this is being an immigrant.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.280
I own, as you know, Margaret Thatcher's bookcases.

32:44.880 --> 32:45.200
Yes.

32:45.440 --> 32:50.760
So to me as an immigrant, to have her bookcases in my house, I've made it.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.000
You're right.

32:52.000 --> 32:52.680
It's not a joke.

32:53.480 --> 32:54.920
It's not, there's nothing funny about it at all.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.080
Stop being serious.

32:59.120 --> 32:59.960
Oh, nice.

33:00.680 --> 33:04.320
Oh, now I'm more nervous and aroused.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.640
Uh, so what else are you thankful for?

33:06.640 --> 33:08.080
So we're both thankful for family.

33:08.840 --> 33:12.440
You, I mean, I'm the fact that I can still get it up.

33:12.480 --> 33:12.960
What's that?

33:13.320 --> 33:13.880
Nothing.

33:13.880 --> 33:14.160
Go ahead.

33:14.560 --> 33:22.000
I think as an author to be able to write what you want and have of enough an

33:22.000 --> 33:27.520
audience that it covers your living, that's as good as it gets as an author.

33:27.520 --> 33:27.960
Almost.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.840
You don't need to be Stephen King or some legend.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.400
It's like, you know, there's lots of standups who aren't like world famous,

33:34.400 --> 33:37.080
but they, they have perfectly good living.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.600
They do their gig.

33:38.640 --> 33:39.640
They'll do what they love.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.240
I feel very, very blessed.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.640
You must be thankful for your career.

33:43.440 --> 33:43.800
Yeah.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.120
Yeah.

33:44.120 --> 33:48.920
Career wise, but like, uh, I think the best part about it is just meeting,

33:49.320 --> 33:51.960
making friends with people I admire.

33:52.240 --> 33:52.640
Okay.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.400
Quite honestly, just friends.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.960
I, you know, the people that have gotten to know me, I hide from the world.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.800
Sometimes I hit some low points, especially with this new, all the new

34:01.800 --> 34:05.680
experiences and just the people that have been there for me and haven't given up on me.

34:06.080 --> 34:09.440
You know, there's days, I'm sure you've had this also where like, I literally

34:09.440 --> 34:10.600
don't speak to someone the whole day.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.920
And in certain times of my life, it's really, I remember very vividly.

34:15.840 --> 34:19.720
I, I was in DC in 97.

34:19.720 --> 34:24.920
I was an intern and that summer, uh, DC closes down on the weekends.

34:25.640 --> 34:29.760
And I remember those weekends when like, I got off the phone with like the third

34:29.760 --> 34:35.040
person, I knew there was no possibility anyone was going to call and what that

34:35.040 --> 34:37.880
felt like, and it was dark and it was bad.

34:38.360 --> 34:44.280
Um, so I, I remember that those feelings of loneliness, um, like a lot.

34:44.760 --> 34:46.040
I still feel alone like that.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.400
Sometimes you don't feel, you don't feel alone.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.920
Um, not anymore.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.000
What's the, what's the reason you think?

34:56.480 --> 35:01.680
I, because there's like, I have a lot of people who I care about, who care about me.

35:02.320 --> 35:07.560
Uh, I mean, the thing about moving to Austin is I forgot how lonely New York

35:07.560 --> 35:10.560
got because it was like one after another.

35:10.560 --> 35:14.320
I lost everybody and a certain, and then you start losing the places you go to.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.720
And then it was just like, holy crap.

35:15.720 --> 35:16.480
I'm very isolated.

35:16.880 --> 35:20.760
And here in Austin, there's not as much to do obviously as in New York, but there's

35:20.760 --> 35:23.400
a lot of people here where people are coming all the time.

35:23.880 --> 35:28.800
Um, so if I ever want to like hang out with someone, you know, I've got a long list.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.920
Um, and these are people who I've known for a very long time, people who know me

35:32.960 --> 35:38.120
quite well, so I could be myself, um, my awful, awful, awful, awful, awful self.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.400
Uh, and that is something I don't take lightly.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.240
I moved to Texas.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.080
It's going to succeed.

35:44.360 --> 35:44.600
Yeah.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.040
It's just a very, uh,

35:46.080 --> 35:47.120
do you know what happened with that?

35:47.360 --> 35:53.240
No, I forgot the guy's name and it's probably for the best Monday on Monday.

35:54.160 --> 35:59.400
A guy in the Texas legislature introduces a bill to have it on the referendum, to

35:59.400 --> 36:04.480
have a referendum for Texas to declare its independence Tuesday.

36:04.960 --> 36:05.800
I'm on Rogan.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.400
Me and him discuss it.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.600
I give it national attention.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.200
It was also really funny because a lot of people like these people have been

36:11.200 --> 36:12.440
in Texas for five minutes, blah, blah.

36:13.600 --> 36:19.280
I go to the Texas legislature, meet with the guy, have a nice conversation.

36:20.120 --> 36:25.560
Month or two later, uh, unanimous, I think he gets voted, kicked out of

36:25.560 --> 36:29.560
Congress because he got an intern drunk and was inappropriate with her.

36:29.600 --> 36:34.560
And at least it was the girl in this case, but yeah, so it's like, um, that

36:34.560 --> 36:36.360
was my little Texas independence moment.

36:36.840 --> 36:37.120
Oh.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.040
It didn't go anywhere.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.200
It did not go anywhere.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.960
Well, but it's still part of the platform.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.120
The Texas Republican party.

36:45.000 --> 36:45.240
Yeah.

36:45.320 --> 36:48.360
It's fascinating that history is probably laden with stories like

36:48.360 --> 36:50.520
this of failed revolutionaries.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.560
We celebrate the heroes, but then there's the losers.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.840
Like myself.

36:56.280 --> 36:56.560
Yeah.

36:58.600 --> 37:04.680
And we're going to mark that one as a failure and edit it out and moving on.

37:04.840 --> 37:05.520
So thankful.

37:05.520 --> 37:05.760
Yeah.

37:05.760 --> 37:06.840
Friendships, right?

37:07.320 --> 37:12.320
But by the way, I want to say just to you, I'm thankful in this lonely

37:12.320 --> 37:14.200
moments for people who write books.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.760
I've been listening to audio books a lot and reading a lot.

37:18.520 --> 37:20.600
I really like audio books actually.

37:21.160 --> 37:26.000
And just like, I don't know, I can just name random person.

37:26.000 --> 37:26.640
Sir, he blow.

37:26.640 --> 37:27.560
He's a historian.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.560
I'm reading on the way I read him.

37:29.560 --> 37:32.960
What do you, what do you, I just see he written a book most recently

37:32.960 --> 37:35.160
about the Russia Ukraine war.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.480
He wrote another one that I read.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.520
Didn't he write about the fall of the Soviet Union or something like that?

37:39.560 --> 37:39.840
Yeah.

37:39.960 --> 37:40.200
Yeah.

37:40.240 --> 37:40.600
Yeah.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.760
It was very, very good.

37:41.760 --> 37:42.240
He's great.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.040
I use him as a resource for the white pill.

37:44.080 --> 37:47.840
He's a objective while still having emotion and feeling to it.

37:47.840 --> 37:48.960
Like he has a bias.

37:49.360 --> 37:49.880
That's fine.

37:50.200 --> 37:55.160
But without, um, well, a lot of times when you write a story that involves

37:55.160 --> 37:58.320
Putin, people are really ideological.

37:58.360 --> 37:58.480
Yeah.

37:58.480 --> 38:04.080
They don't really like, they don't write with a calmness and the clarity

38:04.080 --> 38:06.160
and the rigor of history.

38:06.440 --> 38:07.520
There's emotion in it.

38:07.520 --> 38:11.480
Like there's almost a virtue signaling and he doesn't have that.

38:11.480 --> 38:15.280
Even though he is Ukrainian and is very strong opinions in the matter.

38:15.600 --> 38:19.280
Anyway, there's people like that and he's does an incredible job researching.

38:20.000 --> 38:26.320
A recent event, uh, like he says, uh, I was looking at everything that's been

38:26.320 --> 38:31.120
written about the war in Ukraine and realizing, you know, the old Churchill

38:31.160 --> 38:35.760
line that historians are the worst ones to write about current events,

38:35.760 --> 38:36.880
except everybody else.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.960
And so he's like, I'll might as well just write about this war.

38:39.960 --> 38:44.520
And he doesn't accept from job summarizing day by day, the details of this, this war.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.400
Anyway, so I'm just grateful for a guy like that.

38:48.320 --> 38:52.840
Uh, uh, so for me, there's, uh, I'll name some historians.

38:52.840 --> 38:56.800
I love Arthur Herman, uh, Victor Sebastian is probably my favorite.

38:57.160 --> 39:00.840
Um, David Petrusha P I E T R U S Z A.

39:01.280 --> 39:05.800
When you are a historian and I tried to do this to some degree in the

39:05.800 --> 39:13.280
white pill as much as I could, but yeah, when you take data and you make it read

39:13.280 --> 39:18.800
like a novel, this, so you're learning about who we are as people, what had

39:18.800 --> 39:22.720
happened, but also it's entertaining and readable that to me is like the

39:22.720 --> 39:25.680
acme of writing and I have so much admiration.

39:26.960 --> 39:27.360
Top.

39:27.680 --> 39:27.960
Okay.

39:28.520 --> 39:29.000
Zenith.

39:29.320 --> 39:29.720
Zenith.

39:29.760 --> 39:30.120
Okay.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.480
Um, this is what writers do.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.240
They just come up with these incredibly sophisticated words.

39:34.240 --> 39:34.880
I'm impressed.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.920
Well, because you could have just said the best of writing.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.760
Acme is also the company and like Bugs Bunny and Wile E.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.760
Coyote is always Acme student, you know, Acme.

39:43.360 --> 39:43.600
Yeah.

39:43.640 --> 39:43.880
Yeah.

39:44.160 --> 39:44.880
Like Acme bombs.

39:45.320 --> 39:52.080
Um, when they are that good, it's, it's just, it just, it leaves me in awe.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.160
That's just the, Ron Charnow is another one.

39:54.600 --> 39:54.840
Who?

39:55.160 --> 39:56.920
He wrote the Hamilton biography.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.360
Oh, nice.

39:59.600 --> 40:04.560
Oh, I have a lot of favorite historians about the whole, uh, time period of

40:04.560 --> 40:08.240
World War II, William Shire, people that lived during it, especially.

40:08.320 --> 40:09.560
I really liked those accounts.

40:10.080 --> 40:15.200
Uh, obviously Solzhenitsyn is, uh, he's not a historian, but his

40:15.200 --> 40:16.880
accounts are fascinating.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.160
You actually, how much do you talk about Solzhenitsyn?

40:20.520 --> 40:22.440
I don't, not much, right?

40:23.240 --> 40:23.680
Why not?

40:24.640 --> 40:29.040
I feel like I wanted to, I, I, there's nothing I could add to him.

40:30.280 --> 40:30.800
Oh, he did.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.040
He's the Michael Malice of the previous century.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.880
No, he's talented, charismatic and skilled.

40:37.880 --> 40:39.000
So he's not the Michael Malice.

40:39.480 --> 40:44.920
Uh, yeah, I, I did not, um, I feel like I didn't, I didn't, I didn't read

40:44.920 --> 40:46.520
Gulag Archipelago for the white pill.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.640
I didn't, I didn't know.

40:48.960 --> 40:52.240
I feel I got a lot of it from Anne Applebaum, who's a very controversial

40:52.240 --> 40:57.680
figure, her history books on the Soviet Union, I think are superb, but she's

40:57.680 --> 41:01.400
also accused of being very much like a neocon and being a warmonger in

41:01.400 --> 41:05.480
contemporary times, and I think comparisons between Putin and Stalin,

41:06.000 --> 41:11.040
although there was a Venn diagram, I think are a bit much because I think

41:11.040 --> 41:15.160
it's very hard to claim that, you know, if Putin conquered Ukraine, that

41:15.160 --> 41:16.160
there'd be a genocide.

41:16.920 --> 41:19.360
I don't think it, I think that's a very hard argument to make.

41:19.520 --> 41:24.920
In these tense times, even the comparisons of what's going on in Israel on either

41:24.920 --> 41:28.480
side, comparisons to the Holocaust are also troubling in this way.

41:28.520 --> 41:28.920
Yes.

41:28.960 --> 41:32.400
And I also don't like how that, you know, I got in trouble.

41:32.400 --> 41:35.920
There was some literal demon who works at the Atlantic.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.800
As opposed to a regular demon?

41:38.520 --> 41:39.800
As opposed to a figurative demon.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.280
I didn't know they employed demons.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.080
They exclusively employed demons at the Atlantic.

41:44.480 --> 41:51.200
And he was giving me crap this couple of years ago on Twitter because I didn't

41:51.200 --> 41:55.840
think it's appropriate to refer to George Soros as a Holocaust survivor.

41:57.040 --> 42:01.120
And I'm like, listen, if you want to put them in the same context as Anne Frank,

42:01.160 --> 42:02.080
knock yourself out.

42:02.480 --> 42:08.160
But I think that's so completely disingenuous and frankly repulsive to me

42:08.160 --> 42:11.120
morally to equivocate between figures like that.

42:11.680 --> 42:17.720
And also to claim that anyone who is a billionaire, who is including Elon,

42:18.040 --> 42:21.280
including Sheldon Adelson, there's no shortage of these people.

42:21.680 --> 42:26.560
If you want to use your extreme wealth, use to influence politics, you have to be

42:26.560 --> 42:31.160
up for criticism and to protect people, Bill Gates, to protecting these people

42:31.160 --> 42:34.800
from criticism just on the basis of their identities is deranged to me.

42:35.480 --> 42:43.560
But also the Holocaust as a historical event and the atrocities within it are

42:43.560 --> 42:45.080
just singular in history.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.200
And so comparing them.

42:47.840 --> 42:48.800
What's the utility?

42:48.920 --> 42:49.200
Right.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.720
You're just, you're just basically trying to take this brand.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.840
I'm using that term, you know, in a very specific way and latch, like when they

42:54.840 --> 42:59.000
say climate denial, no one's denying climate exists.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.920
So you're just trying to go off of Holocaust denial.

43:00.920 --> 43:01.720
I think it's shameless.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.000
And I think it's, it's, it's gross.

43:04.600 --> 43:05.680
And it cheapens everything.

43:05.800 --> 43:06.000
Yeah.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.680
There's deep, important lessons about the Holocaust.

43:09.360 --> 43:09.800
Yes.

43:10.680 --> 43:15.000
To me, the lessons are about how extreme it can get.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.400
And how fast, that's the one.

43:19.080 --> 43:22.760
So, you know, people ask, Oh, are humans basically good?

43:23.160 --> 43:24.320
Are they basically evil?

43:24.840 --> 43:26.400
I always say they're basically animals.

43:27.360 --> 43:33.760
And I think people are, most people are almost fundamentally deranged and

43:33.760 --> 43:37.160
that there's basically this veneer of civilization and decency.

43:37.800 --> 43:42.160
And when shit hits the fan and we see this over and over, they do things that

43:42.200 --> 43:45.280
would have been completely unthinkable even to themselves five years ago.

43:46.440 --> 43:50.000
Most people are fundamentally deranged with a veneer of civility.

43:50.040 --> 43:53.040
There's a show called, um, I think I disagree with that.

43:53.320 --> 43:54.240
Well, what's the show called?

43:54.600 --> 43:59.000
I'm having Alzheimer's because of the advanced age, the skincare.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.480
There's a, there's a show called, I think you should leave.

44:01.840 --> 44:02.360
It's a sketch.

44:02.360 --> 44:03.040
You should leave.

44:03.120 --> 44:03.440
Okay.

44:03.480 --> 44:03.840
Sorry.

44:04.080 --> 44:09.840
It's a sketch comedy show and he captures these great, has your hair

44:09.840 --> 44:16.200
princess, he captures these great moments of just the, like, just the very thin

44:16.200 --> 44:22.240
veneer of normalcy and just the craziness that's so frequently lurking underneath.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.800
Another great example of this, when this is dealing with people who are literally

44:24.800 --> 44:27.040
crazy, have you ever seen the show Hoarders?

44:27.120 --> 44:30.400
So every episode of Hoarders, every, there's two, usually two people in every

44:30.400 --> 44:32.360
episode, but every episode has the same plot line.

44:33.280 --> 44:38.720
Veneer of normalcy, veneer of normalcy, veneer of normalcy, slight expression

44:38.720 --> 44:40.880
of concern, full-blown derangement.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.200
And it always follows that exact pattern.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.680
Yeah, I don't know.

44:45.720 --> 44:52.080
I think the deep ocean of the human mind is, is good.

44:52.840 --> 44:56.080
Like there's a longing to be good to others.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.640
I have seen literally no evidence of this.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.880
And I know everything's the deep ocean with you people, but like,

45:01.600 --> 45:02.720
What do you mean you people?

45:02.760 --> 45:03.200
Pirates.

45:03.880 --> 45:05.840
Oh, I don't see it.

45:06.960 --> 45:07.480
You, you-

45:07.480 --> 45:08.280
What's that Mr. Parrot?

45:09.320 --> 45:10.600
You an antisemite?

45:12.320 --> 45:15.840
No, that's not nice to say in front of such a large audience.

45:16.560 --> 45:17.960
You're embarrassing me, Mr. Parrot.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.680
Lex, you have-

45:19.680 --> 45:20.440
What's that Mr. Parrot?

45:20.440 --> 45:21.040
You, you have-

45:21.520 --> 45:25.320
He's, he's a run of the mill troll and barely an intellectual.

45:25.440 --> 45:26.680
That's not nice to say.

45:26.920 --> 45:27.720
That's not true.

45:28.800 --> 45:29.760
We talked about this.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.120
You have to see the good in people.

45:31.320 --> 45:38.120
You have seen personally how quickly and easily it is for human

45:38.120 --> 45:44.360
beings to form outgroups and to just read others, just as I just did a

45:44.360 --> 45:47.000
minute ago with the Atlantic, completely out of the human race.

45:47.760 --> 45:51.040
And that happens constantly and very easily.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.520
Humans are tribal beings.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.640
So that does not, I don't see how that's compatible with

45:56.640 --> 45:58.200
this essential desire to do good.

45:58.760 --> 46:04.480
No, I think it's like in 1984, the two minutes of hate, there is a part of

46:04.480 --> 46:10.800
humans that wants to be tribal and wants to direct, get angry and hateful.

46:11.080 --> 46:13.120
And then that hate is easy to direct.

46:13.240 --> 46:13.520
Yes.

46:13.760 --> 46:19.280
Especially people as you, as an anarchist talk about the people in power,

46:19.280 --> 46:20.320
they can direct that anger.

46:20.840 --> 46:26.440
But I think if you just look at recent human history, the desire for good, the

46:26.440 --> 46:31.160
communal desire for good outweighs that, I think, like most of life on earth

46:31.160 --> 46:37.640
right now, people are being good to each other in the most fundamental sense

46:37.800 --> 46:39.800
relative to how nature usually works.

46:40.080 --> 46:43.120
I think you're both wrong about people and about nature.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.400
So nature is not inherently violent in the sense like, for example, if

46:50.400 --> 46:54.040
anyone has an aquarium, if you look at wildlife, yeah, you're going to have

46:54.040 --> 46:57.160
predator prey, but these animals are going to be coexisting and they're going

46:57.160 --> 46:59.000
to be ignoring each other for the most part, right?

46:59.600 --> 47:04.440
And as for humans, you know, being essentially good, I think humans are

47:04.440 --> 47:09.120
essentially to each other, you said, I think they're essentially civil and

47:09.120 --> 47:11.520
amiable, but that's not really being good.

47:12.280 --> 47:15.560
Good, I think, is a thing that gets illustrated when you're challenged,

47:15.560 --> 47:17.000
when there's a difficult situation.

47:17.000 --> 47:17.360
Yes.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.840
I mean, civility is a good starting point.

47:20.360 --> 47:25.880
And then when there's a big challenge that comes, people step up on average.

47:26.480 --> 47:30.240
I completely agree with you that human beings are capable of such

47:30.240 --> 47:35.360
profound goodness that it kind of makes you extremely emotional.

47:35.440 --> 47:39.200
And I certainly think that that's true, but I think that that's

47:39.520 --> 47:41.160
more unusual than is the norm.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.320
I see beauty everywhere.

47:43.640 --> 47:45.880
So do I, but that doesn't mean it's in every person.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.400
Not in every person, but in most people.

47:48.720 --> 47:52.200
I think, I mean, I wish there was a really good way to measure this.

47:52.600 --> 47:57.920
My general sense of the world is just, there's so much incredible both in

47:57.920 --> 48:02.760
terms of economics, in terms of art, in terms of just creation as a whole

48:02.760 --> 48:08.080
that's happened over the past century, that it feels like the good is

48:08.080 --> 48:09.360
outpowering the bad.

48:09.480 --> 48:15.280
You just did the perfect segue to the box.

48:16.480 --> 48:17.280
What's in the box?

48:17.920 --> 48:19.960
So is it your fragile ego?

48:20.920 --> 48:22.360
That's my, you stole my joke.

48:22.800 --> 48:23.880
You stole my joke.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.600
That was the joke I made at you before we recorded.

48:27.240 --> 48:28.160
You stole my joke.

48:28.160 --> 48:28.640
No, it didn't.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.080
I write all your material.

48:31.120 --> 48:31.760
You hack.

48:33.680 --> 48:39.640
So as you know, I have a lot of beautiful stuff in my house because I think it's

48:39.640 --> 48:44.200
something very important, everyone listening, if you accomplish something

48:44.240 --> 48:50.120
that is great, some achievement, what I like to do is buy myself something to

48:50.120 --> 48:55.600
remember that moment because sometimes when it's hard, you forget you've done

48:55.600 --> 48:56.560
great things in your life.

48:56.560 --> 48:57.640
You've had accomplishments.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.880
It doesn't have to be some amazing factory.

48:59.880 --> 49:06.360
It could just be like my first job where I got a raise or you know what, anything.

49:07.240 --> 49:15.120
So there's this amazing sculptor named Jake Michael Singer, a singer who's a

49:15.120 --> 49:18.120
sculptor, and I saw a piece of him.

49:18.120 --> 49:19.200
How's the singing voice?

49:21.320 --> 49:22.320
This is joke song.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.440
Hold on, I could go somewhere with this.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.000
How's the singing voice?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.280
Do you want me to write your joke for you?

49:27.280 --> 49:27.560
Yeah.

49:27.560 --> 49:28.400
What's the punchline?

49:30.360 --> 49:31.280
Hard.

49:33.560 --> 49:34.360
That's what she said.

49:34.360 --> 49:37.360
So I followed him on Instagram.

49:37.960 --> 49:45.840
He followed me back and he's like, if I made, he says, what's the point of being

49:45.840 --> 49:54.080
an artist if the work I create isn't in the spaces of people I like and admire?

49:54.520 --> 49:56.280
He's a big fan of yours.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.840
You've given him, in our episodes together, give him joy.

49:59.040 --> 50:03.560
So he said, if I get a sculpt, make Lex a sculpture, will he put on the shelf?

50:03.560 --> 50:04.400
Behind him.

50:04.960 --> 50:11.800
And what that reminded me of is when I was a kid, you read Batman comics and

50:11.800 --> 50:14.840
there's the Batcave and the Batcave has all this cool stuff in it.

50:14.880 --> 50:18.400
I didn't realize until much later that all of those things in the Batcave

50:18.440 --> 50:20.080
had an origin story.

50:20.400 --> 50:24.200
So the giant penny, the dinosaur, there was actually a story where that came from.

50:24.200 --> 50:27.920
So if you're a fan of a show, you can spot, oh, this is when this appeared.

50:27.920 --> 50:28.680
This is when that appeared.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.400
This is when that appeared.

50:29.400 --> 50:31.520
So he made you this sculpture.

50:31.560 --> 50:35.240
He lives in Turkey and it's called Chance Murmur.

50:35.960 --> 50:38.160
And it is, I haven't even seen it yet.

50:38.360 --> 50:39.640
It is absolutely beautiful.

50:39.880 --> 50:42.200
I just, so you want to do a little unboxing?

50:42.200 --> 50:42.720
Yes.

50:42.920 --> 50:43.440
Okay.

50:45.640 --> 50:48.560
Axe or body spray.

50:51.840 --> 50:52.360
All right.

50:52.600 --> 50:53.120
Let's do it.

50:53.120 --> 50:53.840
Let's unbox.

50:57.840 --> 50:58.760
He left his other box.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.600
He left his other box.

51:02.840 --> 51:06.360
You know, that Steven Seagal movie where there's like a stripper

51:06.360 --> 51:09.080
that comes out of the box under siege.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.280
He is on a boat.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.040
You're not an action film guy.

51:14.080 --> 51:14.400
No.

51:19.360 --> 51:19.760
One.

51:21.120 --> 51:23.320
What does the pirate say when he turns 80?

51:24.680 --> 51:25.080
What?

51:25.320 --> 51:26.400
I'm 80.

51:28.920 --> 51:29.720
I'm 80.

51:29.800 --> 51:30.120
Oh.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.560
Yeah, that's how I know you don't like humor.

51:35.520 --> 51:36.440
I just don't like pirates.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.240
Well, your mom does.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.200
Do you play any musical instruments?

51:40.680 --> 51:40.920
Nope.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.040
Neither do you.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.280
I've seen your guitar videos.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.000
Here's a big piece of wood for you.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.320
That's what it feels like.

51:51.320 --> 51:51.880
Just so you know.

51:53.400 --> 51:53.800
Oh wow.

51:54.800 --> 51:59.040
Oh my God.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.000
He's traveled across the world.

52:05.680 --> 52:09.520
So here's why his work speaks so much to me.

52:10.520 --> 52:15.080
So first of all, he's combining so many different references.

52:15.800 --> 52:19.840
It's Nike, the goddess of victory, right?

52:19.880 --> 52:22.600
It's that it looks like an angel as well.

52:23.120 --> 52:26.720
Um, the Italian futurists, which is my favorite art movement from the early

52:26.720 --> 52:31.040
20th century, they tried to capture motion in 2d or 3d form.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.280
Well, Jake, thank you.

52:34.680 --> 52:35.200
Thank you.

52:35.960 --> 52:36.400
Thank you.

52:36.440 --> 52:38.120
Thank you for creating beautiful things.

52:38.360 --> 52:41.520
And I thank you for caring about somebody like me and somebody like Michael.

52:42.120 --> 52:43.160
Who really feels the love.

52:43.760 --> 52:44.520
That's the other thing.

52:45.080 --> 52:50.360
When you have something that matters to you in your house and you're having a

52:50.360 --> 52:54.000
bad day, you can look at it and remember, you know what I mean?

52:54.040 --> 52:55.200
That spirit of joy.

52:56.160 --> 52:57.720
And I actually have a list here.

52:57.920 --> 52:58.240
Okay.

52:58.320 --> 52:59.360
I got a little rant ready.

52:59.400 --> 53:00.120
You want to hear my rant?

53:00.160 --> 53:00.920
Yeah, let's go.

53:02.040 --> 53:07.920
One of the things that drives me crazy is when people, especially conservatives

53:08.560 --> 53:13.520
think that all contemporary art is ugly or abstract or like literally garbage.

53:14.080 --> 53:19.160
And there's a lot of that, but so much of the stuff out there in galleries is not

53:19.160 --> 53:23.520
only not crazy expensive, but they're trying to sell things for people in their

53:23.520 --> 53:26.720
house and these are young artists, you know, they're trying to add beauty.

53:27.360 --> 53:28.320
I have a list.

53:28.880 --> 53:31.800
So if you don't believe me and you think all contemporary art is garbage or

53:31.800 --> 53:35.000
terrible, go to the website or any of these places that I'm going to rattle off.

53:35.320 --> 53:38.760
Look through them and you're telling me that, that it's not about creating

53:38.760 --> 53:40.360
beauty and joy and things in people's lives.

53:40.360 --> 53:42.520
So I don't have any relationship with any of these people.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.320
These are just some galleries that follow on Instagram.

53:45.840 --> 53:51.040
Utre Gallery, Antler Gallery, Giant Robot 2, Beinart, I don't know how to pronounce

53:51.040 --> 53:55.960
it, I'm sorry, B-E-I-N-A-R-T, Spoke Art Gallery, VAR Gallery in Milwaukee.

53:55.960 --> 53:56.600
I was there.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.480
The pieces were not expensive at all.

53:58.520 --> 53:59.600
What kind of art are we talking about?

53:59.640 --> 54:00.200
Everything?

54:00.400 --> 54:03.520
Mostly paintings, mostly paintings, some sculptures too, like this.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.640
Corey Halford is my favorite one in LA.

54:06.120 --> 54:09.400
Knight Gallery, Vertical Gallery, Avant Gallery, Hive Gallery, Haven

54:09.400 --> 54:10.880
Gallery, and Curio Art Gallery.

54:11.800 --> 54:15.200
I'm telling you, it's not exorbitant.

54:15.400 --> 54:19.160
This is not the kind of thing where you have to go to a museum and be like,

54:19.760 --> 54:20.800
this doesn't make sense to me.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.920
You look at it right away, you're like, okay, I know what this is and it's

54:22.920 --> 54:28.000
beautiful, it's awesome, and you're supporting someone who's young and creative

54:28.440 --> 54:31.120
trying to do something and make the world a better place.

54:31.120 --> 54:33.440
So I'm a big fan of the contemporary art scene.

54:33.720 --> 54:38.280
A lot of it is not great, but even the stuff that's not great is very

54:38.280 --> 54:40.800
rarely disgusting or gross.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.520
It's just like, okay, I've seen this before or something like that.

54:43.800 --> 54:44.120
Okay.

54:44.360 --> 54:49.120
There's like a standup where I'll pay money for the ticket and someone's

54:49.120 --> 54:49.880
like, who's an opener?

54:49.880 --> 54:53.080
It's like, I wouldn't pay to see him perform, but he sure still made me laugh.

54:53.280 --> 54:56.960
That person is still by far more good than bad.

54:57.240 --> 55:01.120
So a lot of this art is the stuff I would own, but it's like, okay, I get it.

55:01.120 --> 55:01.560
I like it.

55:01.840 --> 55:06.040
Well, as the analogy goes, I really like going to open mics actually, because

55:06.680 --> 55:11.040
like fun, it sounds absurd to say, but funny isn't the only thing that's

55:11.040 --> 55:13.280
beautiful about standup comedy.

55:13.560 --> 55:19.080
It's the, it's, it's going for it.

55:19.560 --> 55:20.960
It's trying to be funny.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.800
It's taking the leap, trying to joke.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.080
And some of the best stuff is actually funny, but the audience is like three

55:28.080 --> 55:32.200
people, two of whom are drunk and bored and you're still going for it.

55:32.440 --> 55:34.960
And that's like, that's the human spirit right there.

55:35.120 --> 55:39.360
Roseanne was telling me how Gilbert Godfrey to go on.

55:39.440 --> 55:43.040
It was like three in the morning and it was like five, her and like three other

55:43.040 --> 55:46.200
comics in the audience and like, they all were just dying.

55:46.240 --> 55:48.200
Like he was just killing them.

55:48.720 --> 55:49.720
Who was your favorite comedian?

55:51.040 --> 55:53.640
Um, Dave Smith.

55:54.240 --> 55:54.600
Who?

55:56.240 --> 55:57.560
And cut scene.

55:58.480 --> 55:59.200
Favorite comedian?

55:59.200 --> 56:02.680
Well, first on Norman McDonald, if you like put a gun to my head and I had to

56:02.680 --> 56:04.600
answer really quickly, that would be him.

56:04.720 --> 56:05.080
Okay.

56:07.200 --> 56:09.360
I would also say, uh, Louis CK.

56:09.640 --> 56:10.120
Oh wow.

56:10.120 --> 56:10.560
Yeah.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.200
Oh my God.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.960
But that's almost like a vanilla answer at this moment in history because it's

56:15.960 --> 56:18.360
like, uh, Louis CK is pretty radioactive.

56:18.520 --> 56:19.000
He is.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.440
Well, yeah, he does it.

56:20.480 --> 56:21.640
The tough topics.

56:21.680 --> 56:22.040
Sure.

56:22.200 --> 56:26.920
The best Mitch Hedberg, the wit of a good one-liner.

56:27.560 --> 56:28.000
It's great.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.640
I guess that's what Norman McDonald was a genius at.

56:31.920 --> 56:32.360
What about you?

56:33.000 --> 56:33.880
There's a, I mean,

56:34.280 --> 56:39.240
we're so fortunate to be here in Austin because that comedy mothership, you go

56:39.240 --> 56:41.080
there and like people are just killing it.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.880
David Lucas is amazing.

56:42.880 --> 56:43.640
Ty Rivera.

56:43.840 --> 56:47.560
Ty Rivera probably did the best set I've seen since I've been here in Austin.

56:47.560 --> 56:52.240
And I, I watched him and I'm like, this guy's even like even bitchier than I am.

56:52.240 --> 56:53.280
So I reached out to him.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.280
Um, so he's just terrific.

56:55.600 --> 56:57.320
David Lucas is another one, a buddy of mine.

56:57.400 --> 56:58.680
Um, you just said it twice.

56:58.680 --> 57:02.200
I think, um, I'm thinking Dave Lando, excuse me, Dave Lando.

57:02.600 --> 57:05.320
Um, Joe, it's true though.

57:05.840 --> 57:06.280
It's true.

57:06.560 --> 57:07.160
It's true.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.040
Dave Lucas.

57:10.120 --> 57:11.560
You ever been to the comedy mothership?

57:11.680 --> 57:13.360
It's a great, it's a great spot.

57:13.360 --> 57:13.880
Where is that?

57:13.880 --> 57:14.640
Is that in Austin?

57:15.480 --> 57:16.200
Austin.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.200
Is that where Willie Nelson is from?

57:18.200 --> 57:18.800
I haven't really.

57:19.000 --> 57:19.360
Go ahead.

57:19.520 --> 57:21.960
Oh, I heard a joke about that, uh, the other week.

57:22.520 --> 57:24.840
What's the, tell the joke again.

57:25.200 --> 57:30.120
What's the only thing worse than giving head to Willie Nelson?

57:31.640 --> 57:31.920
What?

57:32.320 --> 57:34.240
If he says, I'm not Willie Nelson.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.200
What's that Mr.

57:37.200 --> 57:37.600
Parrot?

57:37.880 --> 57:39.000
I know he's not funny.

57:39.760 --> 57:40.440
He's better.

57:40.640 --> 57:43.520
He's, he thinks he's better on Twitter, but that's not nice to

57:43.520 --> 57:44.920
say right in front of his face.

57:47.120 --> 57:48.280
Just think how he feels.

57:49.320 --> 57:51.360
The statues chance murmur is judging you.

57:51.960 --> 57:52.480
Chance.

57:52.560 --> 57:53.560
It's called chance murmur.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.360
Chance murmur.

57:55.680 --> 57:56.720
God, that's so beautiful.

57:56.920 --> 57:57.640
That's gorgeous.

57:57.840 --> 57:59.760
This is, this is another reason I hate cynicism.

57:59.800 --> 58:00.880
And I talk about this a lot.

58:01.880 --> 58:07.920
Even just on Etsy, there's so many small, not huge companies, like individual

58:07.920 --> 58:13.160
artisans who are creating great stuff, um, and just making it happen.

58:13.240 --> 58:16.000
And it's really sad for me where people can't see that.

58:16.080 --> 58:18.720
Or if they're like, well, how could I be excited about a sculpture

58:18.720 --> 58:20.800
when blah, blah, blah, the Middle East.

58:20.800 --> 58:23.960
And it's just like, you can always look for an excuse not to look for joy,

58:24.280 --> 58:26.080
or you could look for an excuse to look for joy.

58:26.160 --> 58:26.360
Yeah.

58:26.360 --> 58:27.240
Etsy is incredible.

58:27.560 --> 58:30.600
I feel the same way about only fans.

58:30.720 --> 58:34.760
I can't even get that out of my mouth before laughing at my own failed joke.

58:34.800 --> 58:35.560
That's what she said.

58:35.840 --> 58:36.120
I did.

58:36.200 --> 58:39.920
Oh, all right.

58:40.200 --> 58:41.200
That might be one of the first.

58:41.200 --> 58:42.840
That's what she said from Michael Malice.

58:43.240 --> 58:43.600
Yeah.

58:43.800 --> 58:44.720
I'm going to count that.

58:48.080 --> 58:49.160
I don't know what I'm going to do with mine.

58:49.200 --> 58:50.080
Cause I got my own.

58:50.320 --> 58:51.480
Mine's three feet tall.

58:51.600 --> 58:53.200
Just like your box was much bigger.

58:53.280 --> 58:53.640
Yeah.

58:53.920 --> 58:56.560
Uh, it was giving me an inferiority complex.

58:56.840 --> 58:58.800
I think I'm going to invade Russia.

59:01.600 --> 59:07.120
That's a Napoleon reference for those in the audience.

59:07.280 --> 59:10.640
Um, I don't know if I'm going to, I think I'm gonna put it in my bedroom.

59:10.640 --> 59:11.960
So it's the first thing I see when I wake up.

59:12.800 --> 59:13.480
Put it in the bedroom.

59:13.560 --> 59:13.840
Yeah.

59:15.040 --> 59:18.680
Uh, do we get through everything we're thankful for?

59:18.760 --> 59:20.400
No, I've got lots of things I'm thankful for.

59:20.400 --> 59:20.800
What else?

59:20.840 --> 59:22.840
Friends, family.

59:24.080 --> 59:25.240
We said books.

59:25.680 --> 59:26.880
I'm thankful for career.

59:26.920 --> 59:29.880
I'm thankful for, I am thankful.

59:30.920 --> 59:35.720
For, and I know people are going to lose their minds and I can hear

59:35.720 --> 59:36.760
them flipping out already.

59:37.720 --> 59:39.440
I am thankful for social media.

59:40.600 --> 59:40.840
Yeah.

59:41.080 --> 59:42.360
I'm thankful for several reasons.

59:42.400 --> 59:46.000
First, it is a way for people to make connections that they couldn't

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
have made in years past, that if you got some weird hobby, you can find that

59:50.000 --> 59:52.440
other person's weird hobby and you make that connection.

59:52.760 --> 59:55.600
It's a great way to stay in touch permanently for people.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.040
Otherwise you'd lose touch with, you know, whatever venue.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:03.160
And it's also a great way to expose, uh, corporate depravity.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.760
When you have these organizations that are dishonest, I think the

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.120
community notes thing on Twitter is the greatest thing ever.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:09.960
Yeah, that's incredible.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.280
I wish they would pay them the attention of the Michael

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.640
Mouse account more often.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.720
You shouldn't be encouraging anyone to pay attention to my Twitter account.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:18.400
Yeah.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.520
It's a dumpster fire.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:21.520
And I, and I don't mean Bridget.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.120
I mean like a literal Bridget Phetasy.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.240
Bridget by the way is amazing.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.400
But your Twitter account makes, yes, uh, not here.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.320
I wish she did.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.560
No, I mean, in this, where we're sitting, it's a joke, Michael.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.000
Is it?

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:34.400
Yeah.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.960
But I, I'm just really glad about, uh, it's another way for people

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.680
who before would have felt very alone.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.400
I know it makes us, some people do feel alone, but for other people,

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.280
it makes them feel connected.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.240
Uh, there's been a lot of talk about antisemitism recently.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:49.720
Yeah.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.920
What's, what's your sense about this?

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.360
Is there, is antisemitism like any other brand of hate?

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.680
There's a lot of hate out there.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.240
No, I don't think it's like any other brand of hate.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:07.000
Because I don't think, um, racists or transphobes or homophobes or

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.760
misogynists or xenophobes argue openly or even not so openly for the

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:21.120
killing of black Americans, transgender people, gay people, women, or immigrants.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.920
And it's not only something that's talked about, it's something that

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.040
has actually happened.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.960
And not just the Holocaust, but just centuries of pogroms, right?

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.440
There's this great book that I read many years ago called the

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.800
satanization of the Jews.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.160
Camille Paglia recommended it and I read it and they live in this, this

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.840
certain specific kind of antisemitism.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.440
And I, I'm, again, I'm not talking about people who are against

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.760
Israel or something, I'm talking specifically about Jew hatred.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.360
They have this moral calculus that Jews are the only people who are capable of

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.480
good or evil and Jews are exclusively capable of evil.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.240
And for example, if you look at the George W.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.120
Bush White House, you had W, you had Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell,

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.000
Donald Rumsfeld, a lot of these neocon advisors.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.800
So if there's 10 people in a room and there's one Jewish person, it's

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.520
his fault and the rest are Jew controlled.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:23.360
So again, they, they only exist as a puppet of Jews in this kind of worldview.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.160
And it's like that to me, if there were no Jews on earth, it is crazy to say

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.640
that John Bolton and Liz Cheney and Lindsey Graham wouldn't be pushing

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.280
for more war.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.560
That makes no sense to me.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.280
It's like you blame the Jews when bad things happen, but when a Jewish

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:47.080
person does something good, it doesn't really matter or just wait.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.160
He's, he's going to do something bad.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.120
Well, yeah, that's true.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.000
Human beings do good things and then they do bad things sometimes, but it only

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.840
counts when that Jewish person does the bad thing.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.600
I wonder what's a way to fight anti-Semitism and fight hate in general.

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.280
I think the only, or the best way, because I thought a lot about this, about

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:15.840
how did gay Americans go from being universally hated and despised to the

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.520
point that many people in the eighties went to their graves, those who had AIDS

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.360
without even telling their parents because they were so scared to now Times

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.000
Square is just covered in pride flags.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.560
And I think, and this, this also works for Islamophobia and some of these other

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:37.520
bigotry is what I call the ambassador program, because as soon as you know

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:44.600
someone who is a member of a certain group, it is a lot harder to be bigoted

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.080
against them because instead of this being this out group that's somewhere out

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.400
there, it's like, wait a minute, I work with this guy.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.720
Yeah, he's kind of a jerk and maybe he sees things a little differently than me,

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.240
but this guy is not a horrible human being.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:04.720
So I think the only way to fight any form of bigotry is to be a good example of

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.920
the counter to these whatever archetype or stereotype is in the culture.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.080
Karl Marx wrote that religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.920
heartless world and the soul of a soulless condition.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.360
It is the opium of the people as the famous phrase goes.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.600
Do you think he has a point?

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.560
No, I hate that quote.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.080
I absolutely hate it.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:36.920
I despise this sort of Reddit internet atheist activism for the simple reason

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:45.240
that I know many people who in finding faith have become objectively better

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:50.680
human beings, they start living consciously, they take morality seriously.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.960
They try, we all fail to be moral good people.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:00.160
So this sneering that these midwits, these marginally intelligent people have

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:05.280
towards religious people, now lots of religious people use religion to

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:11.840
rationalize their bad behavior or sinful or big ego, so on and so forth.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:12.840
That exists.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.400
That's true.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:20.160
But to say that it never helps anyone and it's universally, see Marx was talking

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.640
about a period, I mean, I'll defend his quote, when his argument was, you know,

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:32.240
the masses are being starved and oppressed, but they're promised, don't

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.520
worry, you'll have riches in heaven.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.240
So you should kind of like, let yourself be pushed around now.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:41.000
And this is kind of this BS bargain that the people are being given.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.040
So that was, I think the point he was making.

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:46.400
It's not, it certainly doesn't apply nowadays.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.720
I have a close to the family in the Midwest.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.160
They're good Christian people.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.960
I remember very specifically this guy, shout out to him, Sean Sherrod, I went

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.640
to college with him, David Lucas, and-

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.760
Have you checked out the Comedy Mothership?

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:03.640
Great club.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:03.720
Where is it?

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.320
It's in Austin?

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.000
Willie Nelson.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:11.720
And I, you know, I was 17, 18 freshman year and I was reading all this criticism

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.960
of the Bible and I was like, look, this is in there, look at this in there.

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.400
And he put a sand on my shoulder and he says, Michael, there's nothing you're

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.440
going to tell me that's going to make me lose my faith.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:26.440
And that was a very self-aware and profound thing to say as I've gotten

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:32.320
older and I have lots of religious people, there's no part of me that thinks

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.640
they're wrong or they should be mocked.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:41.000
It's like, it also reminds me of when people sneer at addicts in recovery.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.520
They're like alcoholism is a disease, it's a choice.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:46.600
It's like, wait a minute, you don't know what it's like to have your

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.640
entire life ruined by drugs or alcohol.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.600
And if you have to tell yourself, you know, I have this disease

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.320
and blah, blah, blah, and that keeps you from drinking.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:58.960
And now you're a moral upstanding person who's reliable and takes

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:00.120
responsibility for their actions.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.280
I don't see the harm at all.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.240
So I think this kind of activist atheism is cheap.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.640
I don't agree with it whatsoever.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.480
And I do not like that quote at all.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.880
Uh, but otherwise big fan of Mark's.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.200
I mean, it's, I think there's a fan of mine, I forget who it was.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:19.840
Apologies.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.040
He had this great quote.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.960
He goes to the gate and this is me talking.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:29.080
He goes, the games people play to feel smarter than others is depressing and

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:33.480
annoying, and I think this kind of fedora internet atheism is a good

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.800
example because here's the other thing.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.760
If you've proven that someone else is stupid, that doesn't mean you're smart.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.840
You could both be stupid.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.040
So congrats.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.160
You prove someone else is stupid.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:42.720
Who cares?

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:43.400
Yeah.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.120
Been sneering involved forms.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:45.640
Yes.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.600
General is just not great.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.920
That's one of the things I block out people on social media instantly.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.200
You're not going to sneer at me in my space.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.040
You can see me all you want in your space, but I'm not putting up with your crap.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.600
I don't know you.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.240
My space, great social network.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.840
Is that on, uh, six, that six, six street.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.040
Hey, well.com.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:08.360
That's how Lex comes like a Pavlov's dog.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:13.800
That was the sound before you get to see, spend 10 minutes waiting for an image

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:18.960
of a lady load one line at a time.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:19.400
Yeah.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.560
Uh, I recently talked to, uh, John Mearshamer.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.440
I don't know if you know him at all.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.480
Uh, so he has this idea about, uh, offensive realism.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.080
It's a way to analyze the world international relations and, uh, the basic idea.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:47.040
And I'll run it by you and see what you think is that, um, states, nations want

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:53.360
to survive and they try to do so by trying to survive in a way that is

01:08:53.640 --> 01:09:00.440
nations want to survive and they try to do so by maximizing power, military power.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.960
And he talks about anarchy quite a bit in that one of these underlying

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.080
assumptions of this way of viewing the world is that states are

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.200
in our kick towards each other.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:10.880
Yes, that's true.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.440
And they operate under a lot of uncertainty.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:17.320
States cannot be sure that other states will not use

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.760
military capabilities against them.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.120
Right.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:26.120
They want to survive and they want to use military power to, uh, control

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.840
the uncertainty to protect themselves.

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.000
So I, I can, I disagree in that regard and I S I see on your bookshelf.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.160
Uh, I think the world is a lot closer to brave new world than it is to 1984.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.480
And I think it is, if you look at, let's suppose China's influence in America,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.960
right, the influence is far more through soft power than military power.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.600
China doesn't threaten America through, you know, we're going to kill you.

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:59.560
It's more like their infiltration of universities, tick tock, things of that

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.160
nature, maybe this would have worked before the pop culture era, but I think

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.640
one of the reasons we have this kind of American hegemony isn't just a

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.160
function of American military.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.400
I think it's much more a function of American popular culture.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:20.000
When you're exporting ideas and culture, it makes other people in other countries

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.840
feel closer to you and also feel forgot you as a friend and also to adopt your

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.120
value.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.080
It's a great way to spread propaganda.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.520
It seems to correlate though.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:29.840
Right.

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:30.960
It's interesting.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.160
It's an interesting idea.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:39.280
What has more power, the viral spread of ideas or the, the power of the

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:44.240
military, it seems that the United States is at the top of the world on

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:44.640
both.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.520
That's true.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.840
And so it's hard to disentangle the two.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.200
Let's look at Europe.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.800
American culture is very popular in Europe in many ways, right?

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.000
Like the best music comes out of Sweden, Swedish indie pop.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.320
They're singing in English, you know, even though so on and so forth.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.240
None of this is a function.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.400
Maybe it's a function of post-World War II to some extent, but I don't think

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.360
it's a function of American bases there.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.520
I think it's a function of we're exporting our music, our TV shows and

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.120
our movies.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.280
Yeah.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.120
It's interesting if the battleground will be Brave New World, the battle of ideas.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.160
I think it's clearly Brave New World.

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.560
I, I, I, it's so much cheaper.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.600
And again, this is one of the dark sides of social media to use influence

01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.080
than it is to use threats.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.040
I don't think, I think COVID is a good example of this.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.440
Like so much of the pressure.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.200
Yes, there was authoritarianism, but it was the fact that everyone

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.840
bought into it, rightly or wrongly.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:42.960
But the vast majority of the population was behind all of these things.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.600
And that was through persuasion, not because, and because people are

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.280
begging for it to come back in many cases.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:48.720
So who's funding you?

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.240
Which intelligence agency?

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:50.840
Mossad.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.440
This is how you do great interviewing.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.240
See, he didn't even expect that.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:00.840
Okay.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.160
What's that Mr.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:02.600
Parrott?

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.240
You knew it, but you didn't have any documentation, did you?

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:10.960
I think Mr.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.360
Parrott is threatened by the better wings on Chance Murmur.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:18.200
He gets like that when he's turned on, he's not threatened.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:22.200
You can't wait until he's all three of us alone together.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.360
It's going to be one hell of a party.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:26.880
Beaks and feathers everywhere.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.520
And metal.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:31.600
Yeah.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.560
This thing is beautiful.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.480
It's ridiculous.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.720
You have, you have actually a lot of really cool stuff at your, at your place.

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.400
It's so fun.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.320
What, um, what's the, what's the cool thing that stands out to you?

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.000
Maybe a recent edition.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.840
So I went to the Dallas museum of art last year for my birthday.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.520
And there was a painting I liked and I Googled it and I saw the

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.920
auction for that exact painting.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:01.400
And it was like, I think three grand, which is not cheap, but not something

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.640
you'd think you'd think in a museum.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.040
I can never afford something like this.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:04.280
Right.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:12.320
So when I was in, um, I went to Houston with some friends, the

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:17.440
side surfs, uh, Natalie, who made the cake of you, um, terrified my mom dish.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:17.960
It did it.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:18.440
Yeah.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.240
Huh?

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.280
No, it's not the cake that terrified my mom.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.240
It's you.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:29.360
Michael Mal is cutting it off, cutting the face off and laughing maniacally.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.920
Well, Natalie's pregnant.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.720
She's going to have a daughter named Daisy.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.560
So congrats to Natalie, but I was in the museum with them and they

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:44.440
was a statue of a thought who's the Egyptian God whose head is an ibis.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.240
It's a birth long beak and thought is the God of the moon, God of

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.360
knowledge, and supposedly he invented writing.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.040
So I thought, you know what?

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.120
I've always loved ancient Egypt.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.160
I know a lot about it and especially the mythology.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.720
It would be really cool as an aspiring author to have an ancient Egyptian

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.440
thought statue in my house.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:11.040
Well, it turned out that the Egyptians also killed and mummified ibises

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.480
and buried them with scribes.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.280
And a week after I went to the museum, there was an auction for an ibis mummy

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:23.920
and I have it now in my house, still in its bandages, overlooking my desk.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.360
And we all know it's going to come to life and peck out my eyes and write with my

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:31.200
blood, but that is one of the recent cool additions.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:34.280
Another thing I have, which is like in terms of Holy crap, I've made it.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.280
I have an original Patrick Nagel painting.

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:40.560
And if people don't know the name, he's like the eighties artist.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.080
He did the Duran Duran cover.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.000
We never see him in nail salons.

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.280
I have a male, which were very rare for him to do.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.160
So that's two of my kind of favorite pieces.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:49.400
You know what?

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.320
He only drew women predominantly.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.160
I have one where we drew a male, like as a guy in a, like a

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:55.000
genet or something.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.440
And now I'm looking forward to, so Jake made me a three foot tall sculpture

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:05.520
called future murmur, which I am ecstatic to get.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:13.080
Just remind yourself how, how many fascinating, beautiful people that are out there.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:21.680
And just the victory and holiness and technology and speed and how many people

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.800
have, you know, fought so that I could do what I do.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.200
Yeah, that's another thing I'm grateful for.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.240
Just like the a hundred billion or so people that came before us.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:32.880
Yeah.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.560
And also the trillions of life forms that came before that.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.760
Oh God, I've gone down this, this trilobite rabbit hole buying fossils.

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.760
Cause as a kid, I thought trilobites were the coolest thing.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:50.120
And I've got like 15 and what's interesting is when you buy trilobite

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.160
fossils on eBay, they're listed as used.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.760
Cause it's gotta be newer used according to the programming.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.320
So it's used.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:57.600
Yeah.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:05.640
But just look, think about all that history, just all the life forms that came before.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.360
It seems like a really special thing we have going on earth here.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.480
Oh yeah.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.880
I think that's, that's very fair to say.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.800
But I also think this kind of is like live life to the fullest.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.720
You know, Camus talked about living to the point of tears, especially on

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.720
behalf of people who didn't have that privilege.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.720
So, you know, I dedicated the white pill to my parents who got me out of

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.760
the Soviet Union and all the kids who never could.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.400
And it's like, when I die, I want everyone else to not know, they're

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.240
all obviously going to be happy, but yeah, like I'm not here.

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.280
Enjoy what you live for me.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.760
Cause I can't have that privilege anymore.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.520
What do you think about Camus as a writer?

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.840
I don't like his novels at all.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:49.680
Oh, you don't?

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:50.400
At all.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:50.600
Yeah.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.320
You've talked shit about the plague to me.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.880
Yeah, I think the book is pointless.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.520
It's fascinating.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:59.040
Cause all you need to do is read the synopsis and then you get it.

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:00.160
Like, I don't think his books-

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.440
Isn't that true for most books?

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:01.800
No.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.720
I mean, like you could take, I don't know.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.920
I just don't agree at all.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.400
There, I mean, it's, it's catcher in the rye.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.080
There's a lot of books that are, seem trivial.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.120
I don't think it seems trivial, but I think-

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:13.960
Animal Farm.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:19.240
Animal Farm is a methodical step-by-step examination of a

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.160
transformation from one thing to another.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:23.240
The plague is not that.

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:31.680
It's a methodical examination of what a society is like under the plague, which

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.520
could symbolize a lot of things, including the plague directly or Nazi Germany or

01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:40.840
ideological movements or it's, it's similar to Animal Farm, maybe not as

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.560
effective in terms of using this kind of symbology.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:49.880
Animal Farm has a narrative and I'm going to spoil the whole plague, the book, The Plague.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:50.320
Okay.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.960
There's a, there's a town I believe in Oman.

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.880
A plague descends, people struggle to deal with it and the plague

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.160
vanishes as quickly as it came.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:00.680
The end.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.120
Yeah.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.000
But there's the victims, the people that take advantage of it.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.600
There's the doctor that emits the absurdity and the evil of the

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.160
plague is fighting to do good.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.160
Nothing for me.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:12.800
It does nothing.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:12.960
Okay.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.480
Well, I can spoil the Animal Farm.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:22.480
There's pigs, there's animals at a farm and they, the humans are

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:31.720
abusing them and the animals overthrow the humans, but then the pigs become

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:37.920
just like the humans, the lesson kids is that power corrupts no matter

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.520
whether you walk on four or on two.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.520
I thought the lesson was that pigs are the most human-like animals on the farm.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.560
I thought, I thought the lesson was that there's no sugar candy mountain.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.080
That's right.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.240
You've interviewed a lot of people.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:54.640
Yeah.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:00.600
What have you learned about getting to the soul of a person, the soul

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.600
of an idea from interviewing?

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:04.480
It's just how to do a good interview.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.440
First off, I'm not interviewing just random people.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.320
I'm interviewing people who are accomplished.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.000
It's not a random group that's self-selecting for something different.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.640
But I think that people love to, and this is very understandable, love to feel seen.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.640
So if you're someone who's done something, even if you're like the best

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.080
guinea pig breeder in America, to have someone interested in your work and

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.880
ask and listen to what you're saying.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:33.040
Cause I remember every book I've written, you know, I have friends and I

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:36.560
wouldn't stop talking about, you know, the, the, the person I'm writing with

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.640
or, you know, the North Korea at a certain point, I'm sure they're like,

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.880
all right, I don't care about this anymore, but like it takes over your

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.600
brain, you know what I mean?

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:47.280
So if you have someone who has an interest or a hobby, I'm sure to some

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.120
extent, maybe your friends or family are sick of talking about it, or you

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.040
don't want to talk about with them.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.440
You want to have, that's the private life where you could just be yourself.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:59.840
So I try to, and this comes from my co-authoring background, when I'm

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:03.640
talking to people to ask questions that they haven't heard before, there's

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:12.080
a possibility that this actor I'm a huge fan of is going to be on my show.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.440
I don't want to spoil everything.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.560
And he's got a very specific role that he's known for.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.960
And I know I'm going to, I'm like, okay, I'm going to, I know it's going to be

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.480
annoying for you talking about this one role, but my goal is to ask questions

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:27.240
that haven't, you have, aren't sick of ants asking, having been asked.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:28.960
Porn star or?

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.280
Uh, no, not a porn star.

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.440
That joke failed also, edit out.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.040
What do you know about breeding guinea pigs?

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.080
You mentioned it.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.560
I'd love to hear, I'd love to hear more about it.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.920
This is, I always use this as an example.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:49.160
So there's, there's, you meet someone, a party who breeds guinea pigs, right?

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:53.280
There's two approaches, either you're weird, get it.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:53.920
Okay.

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:55.720
Or sit down and tell me everything.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:21:00.320
And I'm very much, and all the people I like are the second group.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.800
When you meet someone who's doing something unusual and are passionate

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.120
about it and, you know, are good at it.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.000
Like that to me is the mother load.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.320
Yeah, that to me, uh, also is the thing I enjoy the most.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:17.280
It's like, because it's like, who you guys hate.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.600
Do you guys hate the hamster people?

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:19.800
Do you hate the rabbit people?

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.640
There's gotta be someone that you guys look down on.

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:24.240
Cause like the Marine Aquarium people look down the

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.320
Freshwater Aquarium people.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.520
Yeah, it's a hierarchy.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:27.240
Yes.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.440
There's always going to be a hierarchy.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.120
This is where the left anarchists and I disagree because they think you

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.720
could have Gallaterianism, there's going to be a hierarchy.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.760
Hierarchies emerge.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.280
Yes.

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.040
There's no anarchy in the guinea pig world.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.520
No, it's just a different kind of energy.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:46.720
Somebody's always breeding somebody else and looking down on the others.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.200
If someone's the other, whether it's the hamster people, the

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.840
rat people, and everybody's breeding.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:52.360
Yeah.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.720
By the way, are you an anarcho-capitalist?

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.160
What kind of, what flavor of anarchist are you?

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.040
I'm an anarchist without adjectives.

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.080
I like them all.

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.960
The black flag comes in many colors.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.280
All right.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:04.840
All right.

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:05.600
You're quoting your own.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.440
Yeah, no, I understand.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.600
You, it was, it was a beautiful line in the book.

01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.480
Thank you.

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.360
I think the anarcho-capitalists don't give the left anarchists enough credit,

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.120
especially for their courage.

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:21.760
And I do whatever I can in my power to talk about people like Emma

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.960
Goldman whenever possible.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:29.120
Do you still think that are some people better than others is a good litmus test?

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:29.920
Yes.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.640
It's worked a hundred percent of the time.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.000
And for you, the answer is yes.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:35.760
I never answered.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:39.800
Oh, there's two of them.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.200
What are you getting all Hitchcock up in here?

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.840
Oh, hey, careful.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.680
I always got your back.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.200
Uh, what little habits in your life make you happy?

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.360
Not that you're in Austin.

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.080
Oh my God.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:11.920
Uh, I was prepping for this interview and I imagined this coming up and I knew

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:18.960
that as I explained this, you know, how sometimes when someone tells a story,

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:23.240
like at first it's amusing, then it's amusing and concerned.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.560
And then you're like, Holy shit.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.240
Like, like where's the exit?

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.880
Yeah, I'm getting nervous already.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:30.440
You should.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:33.280
So I'm going to tell you something.

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.760
I've told only a couple of people.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:45.520
This is my absolutely off the charts, autistic approach to shaving.

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:51.440
Oh, so I have this insane system.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.280
Uh, you asked about habits.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:53.840
I give me joy.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.800
I used to hate shaving.

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:55.440
I used to hate it.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.960
There's something called wet shaving.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:04.640
So wet shaving is you get the brush, you get the soap that's in a canister.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.000
Yes.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:05.600
Stir it up.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.200
You paint your face and then you shave.

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:10.600
The thing is there are.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.920
Dozens of these shaving soap companies.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:15.440
Yeah.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:15.960
Okay.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:22.720
So I tried a couple of hundred of these soaps cause you're testing for scent.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:28.600
You're testing for what the lather thickness and also how smooth of a shave

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:34.800
it gives you, I have it down and I'm not making this up.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:35.680
I'm not this creative.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.880
I haven't down to a cycle of 67 soaps.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:39.440
Yeah.

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:40.120
Okay.

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:51.160
So this cycle, so 67, when I use up one soap, that is a slot that I will have to

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:56.800
try new ones and I will try new ones in that slot until I get one that I like.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.960
And then that slot is filled.

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:07.560
So right now I have 67 that I use and I have 86 candidates in the queue.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.200
Do you label them?

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.680
Do you remember like which one is which?

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:11.480
Well, they all have beautiful labels.

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.160
I mean, these are artisans who are creating these amazing things.

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:18.040
So they're, I would encourage everyone to try this hobby.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:18.600
Who's a guy.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.800
It's so much fun.

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:23.520
I will give a shout out to the companies that are the best.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:29.600
So the best company in my opinion is a company called, they just changed the

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:34.480
name because you know what they're originally called, I'm not joking, grooming

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.640
department and now it's like, yeah, but it has certain connotations in

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.440
contemporary discourse.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.480
So now he changed his name to Ion Skincare AION.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:50.400
That's the sense of the most sophisticated, the most diverse, and the

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.280
soap is just really high quality.

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:56.840
Another amazing company is Barrister and Man.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.000
And if I'm going to tell you to try one, it's called Shesher.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:05.360
He comes out with new ones every month or so, a lot of it's missed, a lot of

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.800
it's hit, just great, great quality stuff.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.480
Another great company is Chiseled Face.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:13.840
They make something called Midnight Stag, which basically smells like a garage.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.320
It's one of my favorite soaps of all time.

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:18.600
Yeah, what makes for a good smell for Michael Mouse?

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.080
I have 67 answers.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:27.120
So some of them smell, some are citrusy, some are industrial, some-

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.440
So garage is more industrial.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.680
It smells like a garage, yeah.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.120
Midnight Stag, it smells like a garage.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:34.680
Some are fun because there's smells that smell like other things.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.160
For example, there's a scent in my queue called Finding Scotty.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.360
It smells like Swedish fish.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.520
Another great company is Phoenix Shaving.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.760
And they have one called Aloha Smackdown, smells like a wine punch.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:51.800
They had one called Yule Ham that they made for me special, smells like a ham.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.960
They had a ramen one, Rockin' Ramen, smells like cup of noodles.

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.480
So they're great.

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.920
And they, every year they do an advent calendar where you, for 12 days, you

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.880
have a little sample of a soap and a sample of the aftershave.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:10.360
So those are, I'm forgetting someone and I'm feeling angry that I'm doing it,

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.760
but those are some of the, oh, and Katie's Bubbles is great.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.120
They're vegan out of New Jersey.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.680
They've got one called Knee High to a Grape, it smells like grape soda.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.760
I think those are the biggest names off the top of my head.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.600
Will that list converge down to a small set eventually or no?

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.320
67 down to?

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:33.360
Well, no, it's down to, it's 67.

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.240
Oh, so it's always keeps.

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:35.520
Right.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.520
So there's a slot, then you know what I mean?

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.960
Like I'll fill that, you just see what I'm saying.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.360
Oh, so you will forever have the variety of 67.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:41.680
Yes.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:43.520
Huh.

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:49.240
You know, you know what, you know how sad my brain is when I, when you were telling

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:56.560
me this, I was like, I wonder how many soaps are left in Michael Mouse's life.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.920
Like you can count your life by days, by months, by years, or by soaps.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.160
That is depressing.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.160
That is very dark.

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:07.720
Cause each, each experience of shaving is a little beautiful experience.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.360
Yes, it is.

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.280
How many do you have left in your life?

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:10.480
Right.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.440
That's true.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.000
Yeah.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.720
I got to tell you there's something else.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:17.240
There's a term called my friend Jackie taught me called touching pan.

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.200
It's a makeup term.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:23.040
So basically when you use it and you could see the bottom, that's like a big moment.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:24.760
Oh, it's a great thing.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.000
Yeah.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.040
It's like, well, it's kind of fun.

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.680
I'm telling you, like people can scoff.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:30.160
It is such a fun.

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.080
And there's a lot of us online who are into this whole space.

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.240
It's really, really fun.

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.440
When did you first discover this?

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.040
Can I curse?

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:37.720
Yeah.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:41.040
Fuck you, Cole striker.

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.440
Cause I was staying at my friend Cole's house in LA.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:44.680
Yeah.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.720
Fuck you, Cole.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.320
Fuck you, Cole.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.800
Cole is like one of the biggest hipsters I know.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.760
He's got the, the shirts with the pearl snaps and everything.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.320
And I'm staying at his house cause I was doing Rogan and he goes, Oh, have

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.760
you heard of this wet shaving thing?

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.800
And he goes, look, this one's Proreso.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.280
That's like the Italian grandpa soap, which is also a great one.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.920
And I went down this rabbit hole and I'm like, I don't even know how

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.280
many, how much money I spent on this.

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.120
And it's all cause of him.

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.600
Oh, but it's like a happy, fuck you.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:11.680
Like, fuck you, Cole.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:12.880
I love you, Cole.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.600
Fuck you.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.040
Thank you.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:15.600
Yes.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.880
That's a good idea for a tattoo.

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.600
Fuck you, Cole.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.440
Uh, how do you have advice on how to be happy?

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:26.280
Yes.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:29.640
There's a lot of loneliness and sadness in the world.

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.480
Uh, here I can give a very easy piece of advice that worked a lot for me.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:44.720
Instead of telling yourself that you have these ridiculous standards, tell

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:49.400
yourself, I can be better, right?

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.840
I don't have to be a great writer.

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.320
I could be a better writer.

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.240
I don't have to be a great podcaster.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.080
That will never happen.

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.600
I could be a better podcaster.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.320
I could be a better person.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.880
I could be a better, uh, at the gym.

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.120
I could be better with my time.

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.720
And when you regard things in those, and especially if you have metrics that you

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.560
can go by, you know, for example, I'll run this many miles a day, things you have

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:17.280
control over, if you, especially as males, when you have this chart and the data is

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.520
telling you you're improving right away, it's like you have the sense of accomplishment.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:26.480
So I think that is a really great way to, uh, and if something is not working

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.120
in your life, let's suppose you don't have friends, right?

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.240
There's the internet.

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:31.880
How do people make friends?

01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.280
Try things out.

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.440
What's the worst that's going to happen?

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.800
You're going to blow up in your face.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.720
Well, you're, you're, you'll learn something at least.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.680
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:46.840
When I was a kid, I was so scared of having things under control.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.520
So like, I would never have to get hit in the face metaphorically.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.480
And then I realized, and you realize this as well, everyone who's important gets

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:57.480
hit in the face, look at the president, whoever the president is, it becomes a

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.960
matter of being strong enough that you could take getting hit in the face.

01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.160
So that is a big important switch in your thinking.

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:05.320
Yeah.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.520
There's a Bukowski quote I wrote down.

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:12.040
Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think I'm not going to

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:16.200
make it, but you laugh inside remembering all the times you felt that way.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.280
There's a part of me that's like that.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.320
There's some days where I feel like this is the worst day of my life.

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.840
And then like shortly after, I think they chuckle at that.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:26.880
Yes.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.240
Just knowing the ups and downs of the brain and the mind and life and all that.

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.360
You ever been depressed?

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:33.640
Yeah, of course.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.800
I'm more anxious than depressed.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.640
I don't really get depressed.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:38.200
I like, yeah, but I've been depressed.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.120
Like low points.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.440
Yeah.

01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.760
But I think I, I distinguish depression between low points, right?

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.760
Like if things are going bad and you feel bad, that makes sense.

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:49.160
But I, when I think of depression, I think of someone who feels

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:50.240
bad when things aren't bad.

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:54.560
Like it's a, it's by, to me, it's like almost by definition, irrational.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:55.880
Well, yeah.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:32:00.240
And there's different kinds of, I like there, there's a exhausted kind of

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:05.320
depression where you're not, it's not so much sad is you're not, don't want to do

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.360
anything, you don't want to live.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:09.200
You don't want to.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:10.120
What's the, yeah.

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:10.240
Yeah.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:10.920
What's the point?

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:11.560
What's the point?

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.080
Yeah.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:16.960
Um, and like an extreme self-critical negativity, which I'm also scared of

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.120
because my brain is generally very self-critical.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:20.640
Cause you're not taking up magnesium.

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.840
Do you take erectile or in the mouth?

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.320
You take erectile.

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:24.840
Okay.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:27.760
But as for the, as for the magnesium, you should take it as a pill.

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:28.480
Okay.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:31.600
Well, the way your mom explained it then is, is way different.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:36.080
Uh, what are you most afraid of?

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:42.760
Holy crap.

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:45.720
That's, that's, I, I, I'm trying to think of anything I'm afraid of.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:53.120
You know, in 1984, I thought like even just if I wanted to torture you hypothetically.

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:57.680
Well, you're doing well, the mission accomplished, you know what I mean?

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:01.440
I mean, in terms of, I'm scared of increasing authoritarianism, but that's not

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:07.360
personal and that's not, that's something that I don't think is as, you know,

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:12.040
as much of an imminent concern as like, let's say in Canada, are you scared of death?

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:12.680
No.

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.480
I think Camus was scared of death.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:15.800
No.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:24.440
He just accepted it as it's look, I, I can, I honestly feel like if I died tomorrow,

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.800
I did pretty good with what I had.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.480
Like I think I did things that matter to me.

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:32.760
I think I moved the needle on things that mattered to me.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.200
I think I did things that mattered to me.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.880
I think I did things that mattered to me.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.600
I think I moved the needle on things that mattered to me.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:45.120
I think I've been a good friend to the people I care about.

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.080
I've saved a couple of lives.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:57.360
So I can, I think it's a very low bar for someone to be able to grow their grave

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.520
and say, you know, I left the world a better place than I found it.

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.320
I don't think it's that hard.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.440
You ever been betrayed?

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.080
Oh God, yes, of course.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:05.600
Haven't you?

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.720
Not as often as I would have predicted.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:09.320
Yeah.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:12.720
The Russian upbringing, like it's like expects everyone to be like just, it's a

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:14.520
time bomb before the betray you have been betrayed.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:14.800
Of course.

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:15.040
Yeah.

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:16.000
Yeah.

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.680
You value loyalty?

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.120
I do.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:27.120
And I also made it a point to not let that betrayal color my future interactions and

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.160
regard that as the universal or the norm.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:29.680
Yeah.

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:31.360
I think that's very important.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:32.280
Me too.

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.000
And also I feel bad.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.680
I've gotten Lex enough that I feel bad for the person who betrayed me because it's

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.840
just like, they didn't need to do this.

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:49.840
And at some point, if you betray someone, you know, and you know, you're not a good

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:50.200
person.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:50.920
I believe that.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:51.920
Yeah.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.920
Like, even if you tell yourself there's something I had to do, you still know you

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.520
had to do a bad thing to someone who didn't deserve it.

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.840
And that's a really hard pill to swallow.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:10.680
In my situation, I still think good thoughts and empathize with the people that have done

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:10.920
me wrong.

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:13.000
I don't empathize with them, but I sympathize with them.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.480
My English is not good enough to know the difference.

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.640
Empathizing means you're putting yourself in their shoes.

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:22.200
Sympathizing means you feel bad for them and wish them well.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.040
Yeah, I wish them well.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.600
Yeah, but I don't put myself like, it's very hard for me to empathize with someone who

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.360
betrays someone that they care about because that is something, it's not that just, I

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.600
think I'm such a great person.

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.680
It's that I feel guilt very strongly.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.320
So if I did that to someone who trusted me, I would really, it would fuck up my head

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:44.440
for a long time.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.680
Yeah, but maybe they were in pain.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.560
Maybe they were desperate.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.800
Maybe they were back to the wall.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.080
Sure.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.920
They felt that way.

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.200
Sure.

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:56.360
Well, that's the sympathy thing, not really an empathy thing.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:35:57.280
Yeah.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:58.480
Yeah.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:01.080
Loyalty is a fascinating thing.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:03.880
Yes.

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.240
I value trust a lot.

01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:06.400
I know you do.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:10.200
Especially because you're in such a public, both of us, we're, you know, very public

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.960
positions, you have to be very careful who you surround yourself with.

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:13.880
It sucks.

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:14.920
Does it?

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:24.880
Well, it sucks because it's hard to, uh, I usually just trust everybody.

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:25.720
That's okay.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.400
That's crazy.

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.440
But what's the alternative to be, have a filter.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:38.040
Well, I have a filter in terms of who I interact with, but within the, you know, I

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:43.520
see the good in people, but then you, you know, in the, in the very rare instances

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.560
that might turn and yeah, it just sucks.

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:48.360
It breaks my heart.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.080
Yeah, I hear you.

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.040
I completely agree.

01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.360
Has your heart ever been broken?

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:54.640
Yes.

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:55.920
Love?

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.360
Yes.

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:05.480
I'm just so relaxed right now and happy, relaxed and happy.

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:05.920
Good.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.480
This is making me really happy.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.120
It's so again, it's beautiful and like eight different levels.

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.920
I think that's the deepest thing I'm thankful for.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.160
It's just how beautiful people are, how beautiful the world is.

01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:24.960
I really, and people are going to laugh and I welcome it.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:25.640
That's fine.

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:32.200
I really sometimes feel like the guy in American beauty, looking at the plastic

01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.000
bag, dancing in the wind, and he's brought to tears because of how much beautiful

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.200
life is and a lot of people feel the need to sneer at that scene and Ricky,

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.640
Ricky Pitts, whatever.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.800
And I think he's got it exactly right.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:46.960
I think he does too.

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:52.000
Well, in the end, you and I will be both laughing.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.160
That's exactly right.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.240
And also seeing beauty where others people see garbage and I'd rather be the

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:00.520
person who sees beauty than the person who sees garbage.

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.040
Yep.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:11.960
Well, when I look at you, I see beauty and most people see garbage and it's

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.280
really unfair, Mr.

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.760
Parrott, that you keep saying that, but all jokes aside, man, I'm really

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.160
grateful for your friendship and I'm really grateful for you as a person.

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.280
Thank you so much for talking today.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:27.120
Thank you so much for talking to me throughout all these years.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.280
Thank you for being who you are.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.080
You are welcome.

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:34.560
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Michael Malus to support this

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:38.880
podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:40.760
you with some words from Andre guide.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.080
Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:52.080
Thank you for listening and hope to see you.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.080
