00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.840
I was in Las Vegas, Nevada one day.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.440
I had stolen the night before, I had stolen 160K out of ATMs.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.720
When in the next morning, I woke up, signed on to cartersmarket.com,

00:14.720 --> 00:17.880
which was run by Max Butler, the Iceman.

00:17.880 --> 00:21.200
And there's my name, US Most Wanted on it.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.000
And that gets your attention.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.480
That was my real name with the US Most Wanted beside of it.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.160
Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.280
But then they did.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.840
And it was talking about me being part of the Secret Service,

00:33.840 --> 00:36.440
Operation Anglerfish, everything else.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.840
So, of course, they're all like...

00:37.840 --> 00:39.040
Everybody's after you.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.680
They're like, oh yeah, we're going to get this son of a bitch.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.200
The following is a conversation with Brett Johnson,

00:46.200 --> 00:49.720
a former cyber criminal who built the first organized cybercrime

00:49.720 --> 00:53.760
community called Shadow Crew that is the precursor to today's

00:53.760 --> 00:56.200
darknet and darknet markets.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.920
He's referred to by the United States Secret Service

00:58.920 --> 01:02.120
as, quote, the original internet godfather.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.600
He has been the central figure in the cybercrime world for almost 20 years,

01:06.600 --> 01:11.240
placed on the US Most Wanted list in 2006 before being convicted

01:11.240 --> 01:15.400
of 39 felonies for cybercrime, escaped from prison,

01:15.400 --> 01:18.920
and then eventually being locked up, served his time,

01:18.920 --> 01:24.280
and now is helping people understand and fight cybercrime.

01:24.320 --> 01:29.400
This was a raw, honest, emotional, and real episode.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.880
Brett has caused a lot of pain to a lot of people,

01:32.880 --> 01:37.000
and yet his own story is full of trauma and pain,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.480
and also redemption and love.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.880
This is a good time to say that I have and I will talk to people

01:44.880 --> 01:50.480
who have served time in prison and perhaps people who currently are in prison.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.720
I will try to do my best to both empathize with the person across from me

01:54.720 --> 02:00.440
and not let them sugarcoat, explain away, or dismiss the crimes they committed.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.640
This is a tough line to walk because if you close your heart to the other person,

02:04.640 --> 02:08.000
you'll never fully understand their mind and their story.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.240
But if you open the heart too much, you can be manipulated

02:12.240 --> 02:17.600
to where the conversation reveals nothing honest or real.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.520
This requires skill and willingness to take the risk.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.160
I don't know about the skill part, but I'd like to take the risk.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.160
I always wear my heart on my sleeve.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.880
If I get hurt for it, that's life.

02:30.880 --> 02:34.640
As I've said, I want to understand what makes a person do these crimes,

02:34.640 --> 02:39.840
the particular characteristics of their temporary or permanent madness,

02:39.840 --> 02:43.560
their justifications, but also their humanity.

02:43.560 --> 02:48.320
I believe each of us have the capacity to become both the criminal and the victim,

02:48.320 --> 02:50.760
the predator and the prey.

02:50.760 --> 02:55.560
It's up to us to avoid these paths or to find the path to redemption.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.320
It's on each of us.

02:57.320 --> 03:05.440
It's our responsibility and burden of being human in a complicated and dangerous world.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.160
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

03:10.360 --> 03:15.280
And now, dear friends, here's Brett Johnson.

03:15.280 --> 03:19.160
You were convicted of 39 felonies for cybercrime,

03:19.160 --> 03:24.720
placed on the U.S. Most Wanted List in 2006, escaped from prison.

03:24.720 --> 03:28.480
You built the first organized cybercrime community called ShadowCrew

03:28.480 --> 03:32.880
that is the precursor to today's darknet and darknet markets.

03:32.880 --> 03:39.520
And for all this, the U.S. intelligence service called you the original internet godfather.

03:39.520 --> 03:45.320
The first question, how did your career as a cybercrime criminal begin?

03:45.320 --> 03:47.920
My life of crime begins when I'm 10 years old.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.440
10 years old, man, think about that.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.520
I mean, you were probably playing the robots when you were 10.

03:52.520 --> 03:57.120
You know, usually kids are doing the Lego bit, getting involved with sports, everything else.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.080
And with me, it wasn't like that.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.320
With me, I'm from Eastern Kentucky.

04:02.320 --> 04:08.360
Eastern Kentucky is one of these, it's like parts of Texas, parts of Louisiana,

04:08.360 --> 04:11.280
that if you're not fortunate enough to have a job,

04:11.280 --> 04:14.880
you may be involved in a scam, hustle, fraud, whatever you want to call it, man.

04:14.880 --> 04:22.360
I was, my parents, my mom was basically the captain of the entire fraud industry.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.760
So this is a woman that at one point, she's stealing a 108,000 pound

04:27.760 --> 04:31.280
Caterpillar D9 Bulldozer, tramming it down the road.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.680
You know, at another point, she's taking a slip and fall in a convenience store trying to sue the owner.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.880
We had a neighbor she acted as a pimp for at one point.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.800
That's my mom, my dad.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.480
Wait, wait, the neighbor acted as a pimp?

04:45.480 --> 04:50.080
My mom, prostitute, I mean, she acted as a pimp for a neighbor.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.400
Her name was Debbie and my mom used to sell her out.

04:54.400 --> 04:58.640
You know, Debbie needed money and my mom would find men for her to sleep with for cash

04:58.640 --> 05:00.480
and she'd take a part of the cash.

05:00.480 --> 05:06.880
So it sounds like she diversified the methodologies by which she hustled.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.680
Very, had that entrepreneurial spirit.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.480
Okay.

05:10.480 --> 05:16.680
You know, we see that a lot with cyber criminals, you know, that sense of being that entrepreneur.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.200
So what was the motivation you think for her?

05:19.200 --> 05:22.640
Is it money?

05:22.640 --> 05:30.000
Is it basically the rush of playing with the system of being able to...

05:30.000 --> 05:32.920
Know the rules and break the rules and get away with it?

05:32.920 --> 05:34.720
My mom's a complex character.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.920
She is, there's no one single motivation.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.600
So my mom was the individual, she's still alive.

05:40.600 --> 05:45.320
My mom was the individual who tested people.

05:45.320 --> 05:50.200
She wanted to know how far she could abuse you and you come back and still love her.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.920
So, and that was with every relationship she's ever had.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.120
She would cheat on the men she was involved with.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.320
She would abuse our children, me and Denise.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.840
She would...

06:00.840 --> 06:02.240
Psychological, physical?

06:02.240 --> 06:07.440
Oh, it was mental, emotional, physical, everything, everything.

06:07.440 --> 06:15.520
I mean, she used to beat me and Denise with belt buckles, you know, and that ended when

06:15.520 --> 06:16.520
she was...

06:16.520 --> 06:18.440
I forgot what we had done.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.440
It wasn't much.

06:19.440 --> 06:26.680
I think that it may have been the part where she accused me of stealing her marijuana,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.360
but she was hitting me and Denise.

06:29.360 --> 06:32.820
We were living in a single wide trailer at that point.

06:32.820 --> 06:37.280
She was hitting me and Denise, we were on the bed trying to get away from it, and Denise

06:37.280 --> 06:41.080
kicks her through a closet, is what happens.

06:41.080 --> 06:45.880
And Denise stands up and she said, you're through hitting me.

06:45.880 --> 06:50.320
And that was the last time that mom hit us at that point, but...

06:50.320 --> 06:52.800
So sorry to take us there.

06:52.800 --> 06:57.240
For people who know you, and people should definitely watch some of your lectures online.

06:57.240 --> 07:03.480
You're extremely charismatic and fun and jolly and whatever word you want to use.

07:03.480 --> 07:11.040
But if we look at that kind of life, there's darkness there, there's struggle there.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.440
There's a lot of darkness.

07:12.440 --> 07:21.000
So how did you feel, if you go back to the mind of the kid you were with your mom, was

07:21.000 --> 07:29.480
there sadness, was there things like depression, self-doubt, all those kinds of things?

07:29.480 --> 07:36.360
Or did you see this crime, this chaos, as ultimately exciting?

07:36.360 --> 07:37.980
Back then I didn't view it as exciting.

07:37.980 --> 07:42.440
Now it becomes exciting when I start being involved in cybercrime, all right?

07:42.440 --> 07:45.520
But back then it was simply a means to an end, was all it was.

07:45.520 --> 07:50.320
So you take a 10-year-old kid and the way I get involved in crime is, like I said, my

07:50.320 --> 07:53.520
mom was the fraudster, my dad was a good guy.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.600
He just forgot he was this good guy.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.520
He always had these principles.

07:58.520 --> 08:04.940
But his issue was, is he loved my mom so much he was scared of her leaving.

08:04.940 --> 08:11.160
So if she wanted to do something, commit crime, cheat on him, whatever, he would pretty much

08:11.160 --> 08:14.800
just put up with it, the one instant.

08:14.800 --> 08:20.280
So I mean, this woman used to bring men home in front of him, tell him that, hey, I'm leaving

08:20.480 --> 08:24.200
you, I don't love you anymore, I want you to die, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.040
This was my mom.

08:27.040 --> 08:33.120
There were two instances where the man, where he can't take it anymore.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.760
And the first instance, I guess I was seven or eight, my sister, Denise, is a year younger

08:37.760 --> 08:38.760
than I am.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.900
My dad actually files for divorce, files for divorce at that point.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.920
My mom kind of goes crazy.

08:45.920 --> 08:50.240
My dad, I was with my dad, my sister was with my mother, because that's that Eastern Kentucky

08:50.240 --> 08:53.700
mentality, you know, men stay with men, women stay with women.

08:53.700 --> 09:00.680
So he was filing for divorce, me and my dad, we were living in an apartment.

09:00.680 --> 09:05.600
My mom was living with her grandparents and with her parents bouncing back and forth between

09:05.600 --> 09:06.600
the two.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.960
And I remember I was sleeping in the bed, we had a single wide bed, my dad slept on

09:10.960 --> 09:12.080
the sofa.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.160
I woke up one night and there was some sort of ruckus in the living room.

09:16.160 --> 09:22.320
So I wake up and I walk into the living room and my mom has a knife to my dad's throat.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.240
And basically, you're not going to steal my son from me.

09:25.240 --> 09:30.480
My mom was this individual that when she knew she went so far, like I said, she was always

09:30.480 --> 09:36.080
this person that tested, well, can I do this to you and you'll still come back?

09:36.080 --> 09:43.120
She knew she was always also this person that if she went too far, she knew it and she would

09:43.120 --> 09:46.160
always try to divert that into something else.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.160
All right.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.040
So she knew at that point she'd went too far.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.280
So what does she do?

09:50.280 --> 09:57.720
She gets up crying, goes to the bathroom and pretends to slit her wrists so that my dad

09:57.720 --> 10:02.600
Ray will respond to that, not respond to what she's just done to him.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.880
That was my mom in a nutshell.

10:03.880 --> 10:07.600
She had a history of doing this kind of stuff.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.780
Motivations as far as fraud with her.

10:09.780 --> 10:14.500
I think with her, it was she was an LPN.

10:14.500 --> 10:21.140
She had a very good nurse, but she didn't want to work was a lot of it.

10:21.140 --> 10:25.460
So with her, it was easier for her to commit fraud.

10:25.460 --> 10:29.420
And when I say commit fraud, it was against businesses, against people.

10:29.420 --> 10:34.500
I remember at one point she's buying over the counter capsules and emptying the capsules

10:34.500 --> 10:38.540
out and putting some other crap in there and selling it at a speed and people are buying

10:38.540 --> 10:39.540
it.

10:39.540 --> 10:40.820
She did anything she could for money.

10:40.820 --> 10:42.620
And of course I get involved with that.

10:42.620 --> 10:50.900
What happens is we were in Panama City at that point and my mom leaves my dad.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.900
And the way she left my dad, my great grandfather had died.

10:55.900 --> 11:01.220
My mom tells all three of us, hey, I'm taking the kids and we're going back to Eastern Kentucky

11:01.220 --> 11:02.900
to attend the funeral.

11:02.900 --> 11:05.420
Well, that was her leaving.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.420
Me and Denise didn't know it.

11:06.420 --> 11:08.060
She didn't pack any of our clothes at all.

11:08.060 --> 11:12.740
She stows her clothes in the trunk of the car and she leaves my dad and I don't get

11:12.740 --> 11:17.060
to see my dad again for I think five, six years, something like that.

11:17.060 --> 11:20.100
My mom, like I said, she used to bring men home in front of my dad.

11:20.100 --> 11:24.860
She would, he'd sit there and cry and beg her not to do it, she'd do it anyway.

11:24.860 --> 11:28.300
When she leaves him, she kept up that.

11:28.300 --> 11:31.760
So we were living at my grandparents' house.

11:31.760 --> 11:35.980
My grandfather, he had converted the house, he had raised the house up and built apartments

11:35.980 --> 11:37.460
underneath of it.

11:37.460 --> 11:42.520
So me and my sister and my mom lived in one of the apartments underneath and that whole

11:42.520 --> 11:45.520
side of the family was just nuts, was nuts.

11:45.520 --> 11:54.940
My granddad, Paul, he would, this is a man that he didn't want you to eat any of his

11:54.940 --> 11:56.500
food.

11:56.500 --> 12:00.460
So there was no such thing as me and Denise going upstairs to eat.

12:00.460 --> 12:05.380
If he found out me and Denise was taking a bath, we were allowed to bath and bathe in

12:05.380 --> 12:10.140
two inches of water one time a week because he didn't want to have to pay the water bill.

12:10.140 --> 12:11.140
There's rules.

12:11.140 --> 12:12.140
There are rules.

12:12.140 --> 12:16.460
You know, if you couldn't have the TV on when he went to bed at night, you had to have

12:16.460 --> 12:21.260
the television, the volume, you could watch it, but without volume because if he heard

12:21.260 --> 12:25.420
it, he would get up in the middle of the night and he would kick the power breaker, turn

12:25.420 --> 12:27.020
off all the power on you.

12:27.020 --> 12:29.420
This is my, this is my, the family, right?

12:29.420 --> 12:34.540
So my mom, she used to leave me and Denise at home for days, man, for days.

12:34.540 --> 12:39.980
She'd go out and, you know, party and, I mean, sometimes she'd take me into these

12:39.980 --> 12:40.980
with her.

12:40.980 --> 12:42.140
We'd wait in the car.

12:42.140 --> 12:46.420
Sometimes we'd wait in the living room as she went and partied and everything else.

12:46.420 --> 12:53.420
Most of the time she left us at home and my entry into crime, Denise walks in one day.

12:53.420 --> 12:54.680
She's nine years old, man.

12:54.680 --> 12:59.300
She walks in one day and she's got a pack of pork chops in her hand and looked at her

12:59.300 --> 13:00.300
and I said, where'd you get that?

13:00.300 --> 13:02.180
She's like, I stole it.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.460
And you know, it's like, show me how you did that.

13:04.460 --> 13:07.820
So she takes me over and she shows me how she steals food, how she's stuffing it down

13:07.820 --> 13:09.180
her pants.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.180
So we start stealing food.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.980
I'm like, hell yeah, let's do that shit.

13:11.980 --> 13:15.660
So start stealing food and we get to the point where we're wanting a sandwich.

13:15.660 --> 13:18.700
Well, you can't stuff a loaf of bread down your pants.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.860
So there was a Kmart in the shopping center.

13:20.860 --> 13:27.380
I go over to the Kmart, get a hoodie off the rack, take the tags off of it, wear it out,

13:27.380 --> 13:28.660
work just fine.

13:28.660 --> 13:31.940
And the way you steal bread is you put the hoodie over your shoulder, stuff a loaf of

13:31.940 --> 13:34.420
bread down the sleeve and you walk out with it.

13:34.420 --> 13:35.420
So we started doing that.

13:35.420 --> 13:37.020
How'd you figure that out?

13:37.020 --> 13:38.020
Just thought pattern.

13:38.020 --> 13:43.700
So you said there's like strategic thinking here.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.740
Yeah, you know, you can't wear the hoodie and put the bread down here because you might

13:46.740 --> 13:49.220
mash the bread when you zip it up or they might notice the bread.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.220
Yeah, we have to think through that.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.220
You got to think through it.

13:51.220 --> 13:57.180
But you got to realize by this point, I'm already seeing what my parents are doing.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.580
You know, I'm already seeing the plodding.

13:59.580 --> 14:03.180
That kind of puzzle solving was something you already developed in your self-individually

14:03.180 --> 14:04.180
because you're pretty young.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.140
Yeah, 10 years old, pretty young.

14:06.140 --> 14:08.780
But seeing how they act, how they respond to things.

14:08.780 --> 14:13.540
And my mom, I guess you could call it a good thing, they never kept any of that hidden

14:13.540 --> 14:14.540
from the kids.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.540
Yeah.

14:15.540 --> 14:17.740
You know, there was no discussions behind closed doors.

14:17.740 --> 14:19.380
All that happened in front of everybody.

14:19.380 --> 14:26.180
And from your young mind's perspective, seeing that kind of crime, you basically, you know,

14:26.180 --> 14:29.900
a lot of us kind of grow up thinking there's rules you're not supposed to break.

14:29.900 --> 14:35.740
If you see other humans breaking those rules, then you realize those rules are just human-made.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.020
But it gets worse than that.

14:37.020 --> 14:42.780
I was in an environment where there were no decent people.

14:42.780 --> 14:46.740
I didn't really meet my first decent person until I was 16 years old.

14:46.740 --> 14:47.820
Who's that?

14:47.820 --> 14:50.000
That was a high school teacher.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.540
So what happens is, is, you know, we start shoplifting food.

14:54.540 --> 14:58.700
My mom finds out that we've been stealing stuff and, you know, she joins us.

14:58.700 --> 14:59.700
What's that?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.500
She joins us.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.500
Yeah, she comes in.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.500
You know, I've got the Intellivision.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.500
I've got the Atari 2600.

15:04.500 --> 15:05.500
Play the hell out of it.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.500
Oh my God.

15:06.500 --> 15:07.500
She starts seeing this shit.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.500
She's like, where'd this come from?

15:08.500 --> 15:09.500
And I'm like, well, we found it.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
She's like, you didn't find that, Denise.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.500
Denise stands up.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.580
We stole it.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.860
My mom, show me how you did that.

15:16.860 --> 15:19.620
And she gets her mom, too, to join in.

15:19.620 --> 15:22.060
And she used to run me and Denise as these little shoplifters.

15:22.060 --> 15:24.580
We'd take, you know, we'd steal stuff for her.

15:24.580 --> 15:30.900
We would distract security and her and my grandmother would steal stuff.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.600
They got caught doing that.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.060
But that's the entry into crime.

15:35.060 --> 15:41.500
And Denise, you know, I'm adamant and I kind of mean it.

15:41.500 --> 15:47.820
But the truth is, I say, and I do mean it, that I'm responsible for my choices as an

15:47.820 --> 15:48.820
adult.

15:48.820 --> 15:49.820
All right.

15:49.820 --> 15:52.300
I believe that when you're a child, you can't control that.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.780
The adults in your environment control what you do.

15:54.780 --> 15:55.780
All right.

15:55.780 --> 15:58.980
Once you're an adult, though, your choices are yours.

15:58.980 --> 16:09.020
Now that being said, there's some you can't dismiss that childhood influencing what I

16:09.020 --> 16:10.940
did as an adult.

16:10.940 --> 16:11.940
You can't do that.

16:11.940 --> 16:17.180
I mean, it was kind of written on on slate that, hey, this guy is going to be this guy

16:17.180 --> 16:18.420
when he grows up.

16:18.420 --> 16:22.700
That said, like sometimes that one person you meet, that decent person can turn the

16:22.700 --> 16:23.700
tide.

16:23.700 --> 16:24.700
Absolutely.

16:24.700 --> 16:25.700
Absolutely.

16:25.700 --> 16:29.140
So what happens is, is, you know, the abuse, everything continues on.

16:29.140 --> 16:33.580
When I'm 15, my dad was in was in Panama City, Florida.

16:33.580 --> 16:38.660
My mom was in, you know, we were in Hazard, Kentucky.

16:38.660 --> 16:40.260
She was dating this guy.

16:40.260 --> 16:46.380
And my mom was this woman that the abuse would.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.620
It was it was crazy abuse, man, just crazy stuff.

16:49.620 --> 16:55.860
She would tell me and my sister, you know, that she gave up her life for us, that she

16:55.860 --> 16:59.380
was going to leave one day and never come back, that we'd find her dead in a ditch

16:59.380 --> 17:00.380
someplace.

17:00.380 --> 17:02.900
She'd go out and date these men and she'd come back and she'd talk about how these

17:02.900 --> 17:05.700
men were abusing her.

17:05.700 --> 17:11.140
You know, so she'd be dating this guy and she'd come back and then she'd start talking

17:11.140 --> 17:14.660
about how he had tried to rape her, you know, trying to get me to respond to that.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.180
And I would respond to that.

17:16.180 --> 17:17.180
Make no doubt.

17:17.180 --> 17:18.180
I would respond to that.

17:18.180 --> 17:23.300
Well, what happens is, and I knew that I don't know if I knew it was abuse at that age.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.300
All right.

17:24.300 --> 17:29.820
But I knew things were fucked up and I was talking to my dad in Panama City and I really

17:29.820 --> 17:35.740
had it in my head that that I was going to go down and live with my dad.

17:35.740 --> 17:44.020
And I call my dad one day, I was set to go to me and my cousins were going to go see

17:44.380 --> 17:48.220
Return of the Jedi that had came out again in the theaters.

17:48.220 --> 17:49.220
So I called my dad.

17:49.220 --> 17:50.220
It was a Sunday.

17:50.220 --> 17:55.860
I called my dad and he told me he had either gotten married or he was about to get married

17:55.860 --> 17:57.140
to this woman.

17:57.140 --> 18:01.940
And basically, Brett Johnson wasn't going to go down to Florida, you know, I was going

18:01.940 --> 18:02.940
to stay in Hazard.

18:02.940 --> 18:11.460
I had to call my dad from Payphone, but the result of that was I walked into a hospital,

18:11.460 --> 18:18.700
got in an elevator and a woman got in an elevator at the same time and I snapped and beat the

18:18.700 --> 18:21.460
hell out of her right there.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.460
And I was 15.

18:23.460 --> 18:26.820
Didn't really know what the fuck happened.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.380
Didn't really know.

18:28.380 --> 18:30.860
But just anger came from somewhere.

18:30.860 --> 18:31.860
Yeah.

18:31.860 --> 18:32.860
Yeah.

18:32.860 --> 18:40.100
And you know, the elevator beat the hell out of this lady.

18:40.100 --> 18:44.020
Turns out she looked a shitload like my mom.

18:44.020 --> 18:50.460
But the elevator door was open.

18:50.460 --> 18:55.380
One of the security guards, I played basketball with his son, so he saw me immediately.

18:55.380 --> 19:02.140
I knocked the hell out of him, took off running, made it back to the house where my grand parents

19:02.140 --> 19:03.140
were.

19:03.140 --> 19:07.580
They didn't know what had happened, so I didn't say anything.

19:07.580 --> 19:13.220
About an hour later, Kentucky State Police, they pull up in the front yard and two of

19:13.220 --> 19:17.620
them get out and I'm sitting on the front porch and me and my cousins are and they start

19:17.620 --> 19:18.620
walking up.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.220
Everybody starts walking out of the house and I'm like, I just remember saying, what

19:21.220 --> 19:22.220
do you want?

19:22.220 --> 19:23.220
What do you want?

19:23.220 --> 19:24.220
Well, you know what they wanted.

19:24.220 --> 19:27.780
They wanted to arrest Brett Johnson and they arrested me.

19:27.780 --> 19:31.580
I went in and I told them everything.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.220
Spent three months in a county jail.

19:33.220 --> 19:41.020
They didn't have juvenile facilities in that county, so I spent three months in solitary.

19:41.020 --> 19:45.460
Went to trial, pled guilty to assault in the first degree.

19:45.460 --> 19:50.600
The judge sentenced me to time served and a psychological evaluation where they sent

19:50.600 --> 19:55.780
me to Louisville, Kentucky and spent 30 days up there and they cut me loose.

19:55.780 --> 20:02.780
They wanted me to have counseling after that and they ever went to counseling.

20:02.780 --> 20:06.860
You know, I wanted to but mom was like, don't need it.

20:06.860 --> 20:15.940
So never went to counseling and I became this pariah in the county.

20:15.940 --> 20:16.940
It's crazy, man.

20:16.940 --> 20:22.180
I mean, not a day goes by that I don't think about that, that.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.180
That moment in the elevator.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.180
Yeah.

20:25.180 --> 20:31.640
And what happens is, you know, you're 15, fuck man, you're 15.

20:31.640 --> 20:38.760
So I go back to the high school that I was in and I'm this piece of shit.

20:38.760 --> 20:42.000
So everybody, you're not the outcast.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.380
Everybody knows.

20:43.380 --> 20:44.380
So I moved.

20:44.380 --> 20:45.380
We moved.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.080
We were in Weitzberg at that point.

20:47.080 --> 20:55.320
I finished up the year there and moved back to Perry County, which is where Hazard is.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.000
So we moved there and they've got three high schools here.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.480
They've got MC Napier, they've got Hazard High School and they've got Dills Combs High

21:01.480 --> 21:02.880
School.

21:02.880 --> 21:10.920
So I was within, me and Denise were within half mile of MC Napier.

21:10.920 --> 21:16.500
Show up there the first day of school and I met me and my mom and my sister were walking

21:16.500 --> 21:20.640
into the school and the kids won't let me in.

21:20.640 --> 21:24.400
The kids stand out there.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.900
He's not coming in.

21:26.900 --> 21:30.160
So my mom starts raising hell and I'm like, no, let's just go.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.160
Let's go.

21:31.160 --> 21:35.520
So from there it was, we went down to the city school, Hazard, and the principal tells

21:35.520 --> 21:40.720
my mom, Denise can come, he can't.

21:40.720 --> 21:45.760
So my mom wants to raise hell and I'm like, no, let's just take me to this other school.

21:45.760 --> 21:55.420
So this other school was like 15 miles away and you know, country high school.

21:55.420 --> 21:57.400
So I go there and they accept me.

21:57.400 --> 22:09.480
And I walked in the first day and this English teacher named Carol Combs, I walked in and

22:09.480 --> 22:10.480
handed her the paper.

22:10.480 --> 22:15.920
She was my homeroom teacher and she heard this voice as the way she explains it today.

22:15.920 --> 22:22.760
She heard this voice and she looks up and she was like, son, have you ever done any

22:22.760 --> 22:24.760
drama before?

22:25.520 --> 22:29.240
And I'm like, no, ma'am, but I'm interested in the academic team.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.640
I was this quick recall guy, right?

22:31.640 --> 22:39.960
And she was like, no, she's like, drama, like, no, I'm not interested in theater.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.600
I'm interested in academics.

22:41.600 --> 22:46.120
Well, she was the head of the drama department and head of the academics department.

22:46.120 --> 22:52.760
So the deal was, tell you what, you can get on the academics team if you start with theater

22:52.760 --> 22:53.760
too.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.760
Okay.

22:54.760 --> 22:59.120
So what happens is she was the only, she was the first decent person I met in my life and

22:59.120 --> 23:01.960
she became this kind of surrogate mother to me.

23:01.960 --> 23:10.040
So under her tutelage, I become the, one of the top academic team guys in the state.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.320
Round there, I was captain of the team.

23:11.320 --> 23:17.240
I was this, this just scourge across all the counties in that part of Kentucky.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.520
You know, we had a, had a meet.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.120
It was like, Jesus Christ, that's Brett Johnson.

23:22.800 --> 23:29.080
You know, it was like, she used to tell people they would, the high school that I came from

23:29.080 --> 23:30.080
was Weisberg.

23:30.080 --> 23:34.960
And the first time that Weisberg came against us, she told me, I was talking to her about

23:34.960 --> 23:40.520
a year ago and she told me, she's like, Brett, she said that first meet against Weisberg,

23:40.520 --> 23:46.400
she said, the captain came in, looked at you and said, oh, you've got that Johnson boy

23:46.400 --> 23:47.800
on your team.

23:47.800 --> 23:53.680
And she said, my response was that Johnson boy is our team.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.680
So, but I did that.

23:55.680 --> 24:02.920
And then with, with theater, I ended up my senior year, I won best actor and actress

24:02.920 --> 24:03.920
in the state.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.080
I only got to ever do that in the state.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.480
So did pretty well, man.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.480
Did pretty well.

24:09.480 --> 24:13.320
Had, had scholarships coming out of high school and everything else and I'm the idiot

24:13.320 --> 24:14.320
that turned them down.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.800
That's a funny question.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
Yeah.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.760
You'd make a hell of a, I mean, of all the many things you could probably do, you make

24:20.760 --> 24:23.080
a hell of an actor.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.800
I'm very good on stage.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.080
I'm very good on stage.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.680
Have you acted professionally anywhere?

24:28.680 --> 24:29.680
Not professionally.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.000
We've done the, you know, the college circuit and stuff like that.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.680
What happened was is, so I turned down the, turned down the scholarships, you know, scared

24:38.680 --> 24:40.360
of leaving, I guess that's what it was.

24:40.360 --> 24:45.360
I was in community college and the community college there hires a new theater director

24:45.360 --> 24:46.360
out of California.

24:46.360 --> 24:51.920
Well, he knew the guy that ran the San Jose state theater program, got him, Edward Emanuel

24:51.920 --> 24:53.160
was his name.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.480
His claim to fame, he had written the three ninjas movie.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.680
Remember that the three little ninja kids back in the eighties, he had written this

24:59.680 --> 25:03.040
for damn film and it had made a shitload of money.

25:03.040 --> 25:07.840
So he invites Ed Emanuel to come down and see the play and Ed had written this civil

25:07.840 --> 25:09.240
war piece.

25:09.240 --> 25:13.560
So we put that on, I was doing like, it was a multiple role thing.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.220
I was doing like 18 different roles in the show.

25:16.220 --> 25:19.600
So Ed sees the show and he was like, scholarship.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.680
He said, look, he said, right now you're a big fish in a small pond.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.200
We'll make you a big fish in a big pot.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.700
And I was like, deal.

25:25.700 --> 25:29.340
So I took the scholarship, man, and he was like, I'll be back in two weeks.

25:29.340 --> 25:31.720
So he flies out two weeks later.

25:31.720 --> 25:35.280
This guy flies back in, he drives down to where we're, where I'm living.

25:35.360 --> 25:39.680
I'm out shooting ball with, with my cousins and friends.

25:39.680 --> 25:43.920
He pulls up and he gets out of the car and I was like, I'm walk over to him.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.760
I was like, Hey man, I'll walk in.

25:45.760 --> 25:46.760
You can meet my parents.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.440
He was like, no, I got it.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.580
I was like, okay.

25:49.580 --> 25:50.580
So I keep shooting ball.

25:50.580 --> 25:57.400
He walks in the house, stays about 15 minutes, walks out white as a sheet, doesn't say a

25:57.400 --> 26:00.880
word to me, gets in the car, leaves.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.840
I don't hear from him again.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.320
Had no idea what went on.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.680
It takes me a couple of weeks.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.640
What happened is my mom, he walks in and introduces himself.

26:10.640 --> 26:13.360
My mom pulls a knife on the guy.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.860
I will kill you.

26:14.860 --> 26:18.040
You are not going to steal my son from me.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.400
Scares the guy to death.

26:19.400 --> 26:24.120
He bugs out and kind of broke my spirit at that point.

26:24.120 --> 26:27.200
You know, I was like, okay.

26:27.200 --> 26:34.040
So went into just full fledged into scams, crimes, everything else.

26:34.040 --> 26:39.600
I had already been, when I was a miner, I'd already been kind of brought up on that side

26:39.600 --> 26:41.360
of the family with the crimes that they were doing.

26:41.360 --> 26:48.400
My mom was, you know, drug trafficking, the pimp stuff, illegally mining coal, charity

26:48.400 --> 26:49.400
fraud.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.400
Illegally mining coal?

26:50.400 --> 26:51.400
Yeah.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.400
Wildcating coal.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.400
Can you explain that?

26:53.400 --> 26:54.400
Yeah.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.560
So to properly mine coal, you have to get a permit, all right?

26:58.560 --> 27:02.040
Eastern Kentucky, a lot of people don't, they can't afford the permits.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.680
They can get them a piece of equipment, you know, you get a doser or a loader or whatever

27:05.680 --> 27:08.280
you're going to get or an auger or what have you.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.760
So you start mining, but you don't get the permit.

27:10.760 --> 27:14.920
So you don't have to do the, you don't have to pay, back then it was like $3,500 for a

27:14.920 --> 27:20.560
two acre permit or $5,000 for a two acre permit, let you strip mine the coal on that.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.840
Then you have to pay for the reclamation on top of that.

27:22.840 --> 27:28.120
So once you uncover the pit, take the coal out, you have to cover back up the pit, sow

27:28.120 --> 27:30.360
grass, make sure everything is environmentally friendly.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.840
You got a silt pond, everything else at that point.

27:32.840 --> 27:37.000
So the whole idea is you buy an acre of land or some area of land and then you can, there's

27:37.000 --> 27:41.080
a whole process you're supposed to go through to find out how many people are involved in

27:41.080 --> 27:45.120
a mining, the smallest number of people required for a mining operation.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.520
You can do it with three or four people.

27:46.520 --> 27:47.520
Okay.

27:47.520 --> 27:51.000
So you've got your loader operator, you've got your dozer operator, you need, you can

27:51.000 --> 27:55.360
farm out the trucking to someone if you need a trucking company, if you need to do that.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.720
Then you've got your, whoever owns the business as well.

27:58.720 --> 28:04.800
So very few people can run an operation like that and profit fairly well as long as you

28:04.800 --> 28:08.520
don't have to do the reclamation, all that crap on top of it.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.520
All right.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.960
The reclamation gets pretty expensive.

28:10.960 --> 28:16.440
So if you're uncovering a pit of coal, you know, a pit, so a ton of coal is basically

28:16.440 --> 28:21.800
about 36 cubic inches is what a 2000 pounds of coal weighs if you're in Eastern Kentucky

28:21.800 --> 28:24.560
because it's that the weight of the bituminous coal and everything.

28:24.560 --> 28:28.480
The fact that you know this is awesome.

28:28.480 --> 28:34.760
The fact that you know exactly the volume of a ton of coal, I mean, yeah, you learn

28:34.760 --> 28:35.760
this shit, right?

28:35.760 --> 28:37.560
Can you rattle this shit off?

28:37.560 --> 28:40.280
So you uncover the pit and then you've got to sell the pit.

28:40.280 --> 28:43.120
Well, the thing is, is that where are you going to sell the coal?

28:43.120 --> 28:47.400
Well, you sell it to one of these other coal tipples that knows that they're buying the

28:47.400 --> 28:48.720
shit illegally.

28:48.720 --> 28:54.320
So back then a ton of coal was, they'd give you like 36 bucks per ton is what that is.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.720
And you'd have to go out and you'd test the BTUs on it.

28:56.720 --> 29:02.280
You take a sample to the lab, test the BTUs, you take that into the British thermal unit.

29:02.280 --> 29:09.040
So you'd test what the BTU on the coal was, how pure the coal is, what BTU it burns at.

29:09.040 --> 29:14.200
Back then a good BTU was around $12.9 was what you'd get, all right?

29:14.200 --> 29:19.560
So $12.9 coal, $36 a ton, you'd take that sample over to the coal tipple.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.600
They'd say, okay, we'll buy this for you.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.080
How many trucks you got or how many tons you got?

29:23.080 --> 29:24.640
And you say, this is what we've got.

29:24.640 --> 29:29.800
Then you'd hire the trucking company and where you get it out, because you've got the agents

29:29.800 --> 29:36.000
that are looking for you by this point, because the people that you've bought the rights to

29:36.000 --> 29:40.120
whoever the landowner is, you said you're going to give them $2 a ton or whatever this

29:40.120 --> 29:41.120
is.

29:41.120 --> 29:45.040
Well, the other people there, are you paying them off or are you not?

29:45.040 --> 29:47.040
Well, if you're not paying them off, guess what?

29:47.040 --> 29:50.000
They know you're mining it illegally.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
They're going to report you.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.360
Well, all of a sudden you've got all these inspectors that are coming around and everything

29:54.360 --> 29:56.000
saying, hey, we know what you're doing.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.600
So they're looking for you to get the pit out.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.120
So when do you get the pit out?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.120
Right in the dead of night.

30:00.120 --> 30:04.520
So you're loading it up two o'clock in the morning, hauling his ass out is what you're

30:04.520 --> 30:05.520
doing.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.240
You sell it out from there.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.360
And your mom ran operations like this?

30:09.360 --> 30:10.360
Yeah.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.160
And you said you worked the mine too when you were younger?

30:12.160 --> 30:16.600
Yeah, I learned how to run a loader, run a dozer, learned how to clean off a pit, everything

30:16.600 --> 30:18.840
like that.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.120
So this is the lifestyle you grow up in.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.800
You learn how to do this stuff.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.080
So I knew how to do charity fraud as well, insurance fraud.

30:28.080 --> 30:32.120
So charity fraud, can we break down some of these?

30:32.120 --> 30:34.640
Charity fraud, it's much more romantic than what it sounds.

30:34.640 --> 30:42.400
It was basically standing beside the road with a sign and a bucket, taking up collections

30:42.400 --> 30:47.760
for homeless shelters, for abused women, for children, stuff like that.

30:47.760 --> 30:52.240
And later on, I branched off, when I started off on my own, I would set up my own charity

30:52.240 --> 30:57.160
company and do some telemarketing and go on by and collect checks and things like that.

30:57.160 --> 31:01.920
We're going to talk about that, but actually, can we just step back and talk about your

31:01.920 --> 31:10.920
mom and your dad, given all of that, given all the abuse, the complex ways that she played

31:10.920 --> 31:16.120
with love to see how far she can push you and the people around her, and they still

31:16.120 --> 31:19.120
love her today.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.480
Do you love her?

31:20.480 --> 31:22.680
You know, I'd called my dad yesterday.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.520
My dad, he's dying now.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.520
He's got a heart condition.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.360
He's not going to get the operation to fix it.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.200
So he's like, fuck it, I'm ready to go.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.840
And I'm like, I looked at it because, hell, I'm 52 now.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.220
Prior to 52, I'd have been like, no, you need to do this.

31:35.220 --> 31:38.280
But I looked at him and I was like, I understand.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.280
I understand.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.280
You're done.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.720
And so he's not going to get the operation.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.840
I was talking to him yesterday and he asked me, he's like, have you seen your mom?

31:45.840 --> 31:48.960
And I was like, dad, I've not talked to her for about two years.

31:48.960 --> 31:55.040
And I told him, I was like, I love my mom, but my mom is not a good person.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.040
She's not.

31:56.040 --> 32:00.040
And he told me, I was talking to him on the phone yesterday, and he told me that it took

32:00.040 --> 32:03.320
him several years to really understand that.

32:03.320 --> 32:08.120
You know, he loved her too, but when you're getting abused like that, especially my dad,

32:08.120 --> 32:14.040
my dad came from a good family, everything else, and an upstanding family.

32:14.880 --> 32:20.580
I think that when you're that victim of abuse, you've never seen it before, you've never

32:20.580 --> 32:25.520
encountered it, and then it happens where you're like that frog in water all of a sudden.

32:25.520 --> 32:30.320
You get to the point where it gradually increases until, how do you get out of it?

32:30.320 --> 32:32.720
Everybody else sees what's happening, but you don't.

32:32.720 --> 32:38.880
I grew up in that environment, though, so it took me a long time to come to terms with

32:38.880 --> 32:39.880
that.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.120
My sister came to terms with it long before I did.

32:42.120 --> 32:46.120
My sister, she's been a decade without talking to my mom.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.120
She had tried to commit suicide.

32:47.120 --> 32:48.480
I didn't know that.

32:48.480 --> 32:55.440
What got me so bad is she said at one point that she always thought someone was going

32:55.440 --> 32:56.920
to come in and save us.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.800
And my response, just immediate response, not even thinking about it, my response was,

33:00.800 --> 33:03.880
well, Denise, I knew no one ever was.

33:03.880 --> 33:10.520
And looking at things now, I think that's where our paths diverged.

33:11.480 --> 33:15.920
Me, it was, if you want to do it, if anybody's going to take care of you, you got to take

33:15.920 --> 33:16.920
care of yourself.

33:16.920 --> 33:17.920
You're on your own.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.840
You're on your own.

33:19.840 --> 33:20.840
It's up to you.

33:20.840 --> 33:27.840
And Denise has always been that child that has expected someone to come in and save her.

33:27.840 --> 33:31.800
Well, and almost like, it's all going to be okay, somebody.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.800
Yeah.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.800
And I knew it wasn't.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.800
No.

33:34.800 --> 33:35.800
Unless you-

33:35.800 --> 33:39.120
Unless you make it okay, it ain't going to be okay.

33:40.120 --> 33:46.200
Are you able to forgive her, your mom?

33:46.200 --> 33:50.200
My boundary with my mom, the reason I've not spoken with her.

33:50.200 --> 33:57.960
Over two years ago, I started this legal career of mine, I've been the guy who has, I spent

33:57.960 --> 34:04.320
a lot of time thinking about my past and those choices and what brought those choices around.

34:04.320 --> 34:06.720
So I'm big about taking responsibility for my actions.

34:06.720 --> 34:07.720
I truly am.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.320
It's really important you have to do that.

34:09.320 --> 34:12.680
Well, my mom, not so much.

34:12.680 --> 34:18.960
So I was talking to her, and I would start saying, she would start the conversation talking

34:18.960 --> 34:22.400
about she didn't understand why Denise wouldn't speak to her anymore.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.400
That was one of her tropes.

34:24.400 --> 34:30.000
So and my response started to become, well, because you were the abuser and you spent

34:30.000 --> 34:34.440
your life doing that to her, so it's more healthy for her not to talk to you.

34:34.440 --> 34:40.160
So she's still not able to see the flaws in her ways of the past?

34:40.160 --> 34:41.280
No, not at all.

34:41.280 --> 34:48.120
So my ultimate to my mom was, look, when you're able to admit that you abused the people in

34:48.120 --> 34:54.880
your life, accept that responsibility and be able to discuss it with me, we'll have

34:54.880 --> 34:55.880
a talk.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.700
Other than that, I don't want to talk to you anymore.

34:58.700 --> 35:05.620
So for the first year, it was calling, cussing my wife out, cussing me out, you know, I don't

35:05.620 --> 35:07.980
need you out, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

35:07.980 --> 35:11.860
And then finally it started to taper off and she's never really contacted me after that

35:11.860 --> 35:15.220
point.

35:15.220 --> 35:18.220
Your dad is dying.

35:18.220 --> 35:21.380
What do you take from the way he's taken on death?

35:21.380 --> 35:23.020
Just saying, fuck it.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.540
You know, it's the man.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.860
And what have you learned from your dad?

35:27.860 --> 35:30.300
What do you love about your dad?

35:30.300 --> 35:36.700
He's one of these guys that, you know, like I told him, I told my dad about the abuse

35:36.700 --> 35:39.220
and everything else and there was a point.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.340
So you know, I told you about the elevator stuff.

35:41.340 --> 35:48.060
But before that, man, it was, it took me 40 years to talk about that.

35:48.060 --> 35:58.620
But it also took me 40 years to talk about, there was a point that my mom and dad would

35:58.620 --> 36:02.860
leave the house and I would urinate in the floor.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.700
All right.

36:04.700 --> 36:10.020
And is that like out of anger?

36:10.020 --> 36:11.020
No idea why.

36:11.020 --> 36:12.020
All right.

36:12.020 --> 36:14.140
But I would piss on the carpet.

36:14.140 --> 36:17.220
Pissers like the Lebowski, right?

36:17.220 --> 36:22.060
It really tied the room together.

36:22.060 --> 36:27.820
I was talking about that and this lady comes up to me after the presentation and she had

36:27.820 --> 36:31.980
a career previous to that where she dealt with abused kids.

36:31.980 --> 36:37.300
And she told me, she's like, Brett, she's like, it's a control mechanism.

36:37.300 --> 36:40.180
The only control you had was that.

36:40.180 --> 36:42.300
And she's like, kids do that.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.300
And I was like, so I'm not unique.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.820
She's like, no, you're not unique in that.

36:45.820 --> 36:54.460
So this whole history of abuse, Denise dealt with it by drinking, by trying to commit suicide,

36:54.460 --> 36:55.460
things like that.

36:55.460 --> 36:56.460
And then finally she escapes.

36:56.460 --> 36:57.460
I'm the kid that didn't.

36:57.460 --> 37:01.940
And not only that, my wife pointed out to me that, again, it's that Eastern Kentucky

37:01.940 --> 37:02.940
mentality stuff.

37:02.940 --> 37:04.980
You know, the male is expected to do things.

37:04.980 --> 37:12.940
So with me, it was almost like I stepped up to take part in those crimes so that Denise

37:13.580 --> 37:14.780
didn't have to.

37:14.780 --> 37:18.220
And she was able to avoid all that other than that one shoplifting stuff.

37:18.220 --> 37:20.060
Denise doesn't break the law anymore.

37:20.060 --> 37:22.940
She goes off to be a, she's a good parent.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.260
She's an angry parent.

37:24.260 --> 37:25.260
She's a good parent.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.700
She's a teacher, a good citizen overall.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.580
I was just the guy that kept right on going with it.

37:30.580 --> 37:31.580
Kept on going.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.100
So let me ask you about that.

37:33.100 --> 37:40.300
So your life of cybercrime, in describing some of the things you did or knew about,

37:40.300 --> 37:45.580
you said, quote, I once stole several thousand dollars worth of coins from a family trying

37:45.580 --> 37:49.180
to sell them to put a new roof on their home.

37:49.180 --> 37:55.320
Another time I sent a counterfeit cashier's check to a victim and he ended up being arrested

37:55.320 --> 37:56.320
for it.

37:56.320 --> 38:01.060
I lied to family, friends, everyone I knew I was a truly despicable person.

38:01.060 --> 38:02.060
True.

38:02.060 --> 38:09.020
One of my Ukrainian associates script had someone who owed him money kidnapped and tortured.

38:09.060 --> 38:11.700
He posted pictures of it online.

38:11.700 --> 38:17.540
Another member, Iceman, used to flood his enemy's email addresses with child pornography

38:17.540 --> 38:19.980
then called the police on them.

38:19.980 --> 38:20.980
That's some stories.

38:20.980 --> 38:26.820
Can you tell some of these stories that stand out to you that are particularly despicable

38:26.820 --> 38:34.780
or representative or interesting when you look back at that defined your approach and

38:34.780 --> 38:36.440
who you were at that time?

38:36.440 --> 38:37.440
Let me say that.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.880
I did not care about my victim.

38:41.880 --> 38:46.040
I cared about me, is what I cared about.

38:46.040 --> 38:50.160
It's rough to admit that.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.880
You don't give a shit what you're doing to anybody else, you only care about you.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.240
But that's the truth of the matter.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.480
I didn't care about the victims.

38:56.480 --> 39:01.720
The lady, that wasn't even at the beginning of my career as a cybercriminal, that was

39:01.720 --> 39:03.240
right at the last of it.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.240
Which lady?

39:04.240 --> 39:05.920
The coin lady.

39:05.920 --> 39:08.880
By that point, Shadow Crew had made the front cover of Forbes.

39:08.880 --> 39:13.880
August of 04, October 26th of 04, Secret Service had shut us down.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.840
33 people arrested, six countries in six hours.

39:16.840 --> 39:20.720
I was the guy that was publicly mentioned as getting away.

39:20.720 --> 39:26.160
What happened was, I was the guy who was, I had kind of invented this crime called tax

39:26.160 --> 39:31.220
return identity theft and was stealing a lot of money.

39:31.220 --> 39:35.480
I went through all my stateside savings and Shadow Crew gets shut down.

39:35.480 --> 39:41.000
I don't have any way to come in with any money, so I start running counterfeit cashiers checks.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.600
De-frauding people with that.

39:42.600 --> 39:48.160
Having them send products or bullion collections, what have you, by COD, collect on delivery

39:48.160 --> 39:51.200
and I would pay with it with a counterfeit cashier's check.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.160
This lady was on eBay.

39:54.160 --> 39:57.440
She had been collecting these silver coins all of her life.

39:57.440 --> 40:01.640
The US currency used to be, the coins used to be silver, so she had a whole collection

40:01.640 --> 40:02.640
of these things.

40:02.640 --> 40:10.520
Like, I don't know, 80, 90 pounds of this stuff and I'm a very good social engineer.

40:10.520 --> 40:16.080
So I convinced her that I was a legitimate person, that, you know, hey, send it to COD.

40:16.080 --> 40:20.440
You can use my FedEx account to do that or my UPS account to do that.

40:20.440 --> 40:25.800
I'll pay with a cashier's check, you can take it in, same as cash.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.800
She believed that.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.480
She was even on the ad and we talked on the phone and everything else.

40:30.480 --> 40:36.560
She had told me that she was a single parent and it was the only money that she had to

40:36.560 --> 40:40.280
put a roof on the house for her and her kids.

40:40.280 --> 40:41.280
I didn't give a damn.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.280
I didn't give a damn.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.160
What was more important was me at that point.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.360
Can I ask you a question about the social engineering aspect?

40:46.360 --> 40:54.160
So maybe specifics like the methodology, email, you said phone.

40:54.160 --> 41:01.680
Maybe you could discuss this process from a bigger philosophical perspective of what

41:01.680 --> 41:09.920
is it about human beings that makes it impossible to be social engineered to be victims of fraud?

41:09.920 --> 41:17.040
So first let me say that I became a social engineer as a child, all right, because the

41:17.040 --> 41:23.680
adults in my environment, as a child, I had to know exactly what they were thinking and

41:23.680 --> 41:26.640
be able to try to manipulate that for survival.

41:26.640 --> 41:31.400
So I became a social engineer for survival initially, all right?

41:31.400 --> 41:34.880
And one of the things that I've seen with a lot of cyber criminals is the exact same

41:34.880 --> 41:35.880
thing.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.580
They're really expert ones.

41:37.580 --> 41:42.280
They become a social engineer as a child, then later on they use those tools to victimize

41:42.280 --> 41:43.280
others, all right?

41:43.280 --> 41:48.360
Which is fascinating because in order to understand what others are thinking, you have to be extremely

41:48.360 --> 41:49.360
good at empathy.

41:50.040 --> 41:54.960
So you have to like really put yourself in the shoes of the other person, and yet in

41:54.960 --> 42:02.480
order to do cyber crime, you have to not care about the pain that might cause them once

42:02.480 --> 42:03.480
you manipulate them.

42:03.480 --> 42:06.840
So you have to empathize and yet not care.

42:06.840 --> 42:07.840
Exactly.

42:07.840 --> 42:13.920
And I would argue that that is not a sociopath because a cyber criminal, and I was no different,

42:13.920 --> 42:16.120
most cyber criminals justify those actions.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.880
So the justification becomes what's important.

42:18.880 --> 42:22.640
With me, the justification was why I did it for my family, did it for my wife, did

42:22.640 --> 42:24.440
it for my stripper girlfriend.

42:24.440 --> 42:29.560
So and I believe those just because I care about love a lot.

42:29.560 --> 42:35.660
So the big picture of that is trust.

42:35.660 --> 42:41.240
How do you establish trust with a potential victim, all right?

42:41.240 --> 42:46.160
Now I would argue online that that trust is established through a combination of technology,

42:46.160 --> 42:48.400
tools, social engineering, all right?

42:48.400 --> 42:51.680
So we trust our tech, you know, we trust our cell phones.

42:51.680 --> 42:52.680
We trust our laptops.

42:52.680 --> 42:56.180
A lot of times we don't understand how they operate, but we trust the news that comes

42:56.180 --> 42:57.180
across the line.

42:57.180 --> 42:59.520
We trust the phone numbers that show up.

42:59.520 --> 43:04.320
We trust IP addresses if we're advanced enough to look at an IP address or a domain or anything

43:04.320 --> 43:05.800
else like that.

43:05.800 --> 43:11.640
Criminals use tools to manipulate that, spoof phone numbers, spoof browser fingerprints,

43:11.640 --> 43:14.240
whatever that may be, whatever the tool may be.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.620
Then that lays a base level of trust.

43:16.620 --> 43:21.460
At that point, you shoot in with the social engineering and lay whatever story that is

43:21.460 --> 43:26.420
in order to manipulate that victim to act not out of reason, but out of emotion all

43:26.420 --> 43:27.900
of a sudden.

43:27.900 --> 43:34.020
This is fascinating about the way humans interact with the world, which is you're almost too

43:34.020 --> 43:35.340
afraid to not trust the world.

43:35.340 --> 43:36.340
You have to find a balance.

43:36.340 --> 43:42.460
You have a lot of sort of conspiracy theories now about distrusting institutions and thinking

43:42.460 --> 43:44.100
like everything around us.

43:44.580 --> 43:50.140
I've been listening to people who believe the earth is flat.

43:50.140 --> 43:55.540
That conspiracy theory is fascinating to me because it basically says that you can't trust

43:55.540 --> 43:59.100
anybody.

43:59.100 --> 44:01.860
Everything you hear is a lie.

44:01.860 --> 44:08.460
You can live that life or you can live a life where you're just naively trusting everything.

44:08.460 --> 44:13.300
That life is kind of full of happiness if nobody screws you over.

44:13.500 --> 44:19.180
Because you meet people with a joyful heart and you get excited and all that kind of stuff,

44:19.180 --> 44:21.540
but if you do that too much, you're going to get burned.

44:21.540 --> 44:29.860
You have to find some kind of balance in terms of optimizing happiness where you trust, but

44:29.860 --> 44:34.380
verify and on the internet that becomes really tricky.

44:34.380 --> 44:37.900
You're almost too afraid to distrust everything because you'll never get anything done on

44:37.900 --> 44:38.900
the internet.

44:38.900 --> 44:42.460
But then if you trust too much, you can get screwed over.

44:42.460 --> 44:47.780
The social engineering comes in where you're like, I'm not sure if I should trust this.

44:47.780 --> 44:51.100
You kind of help them build the narrative.

44:51.100 --> 44:52.100
It's good.

44:52.100 --> 44:53.100
It's good.

44:53.100 --> 44:54.100
It's good.

44:54.100 --> 44:59.340
A lot of the times that social engineering is just feeding into what the victim wants

44:59.340 --> 45:01.620
to believe.

45:01.620 --> 45:03.660
It's not really coming up with a brand new story at all.

45:03.660 --> 45:09.180
It's just knowing what the motivations of that victim is feeding into it at that point.

45:09.660 --> 45:15.300
Again, that social engineer has to almost immediately know what's driving that person

45:15.300 --> 45:16.860
that they're talking about.

45:16.860 --> 45:21.060
If I'm working on a phone, talking to someone over the phone, I have to know within seconds

45:21.060 --> 45:26.220
what I need to say, how I need to act to interact with that customer service agent or whoever

45:26.220 --> 45:28.180
I'm talking to on the other end of the line.

45:28.180 --> 45:33.460
So fascinating because you truly are empathizing with the other person.

45:33.460 --> 45:34.460
I've used it.

45:34.460 --> 45:40.900
This business man, Steven Schwartzman, I've talked to a few times.

45:40.900 --> 45:49.020
He mentioned this thing that the way you build deep relationships is you really kind of notice

45:49.020 --> 45:56.260
the things that people are telling you, like what they want and what they're bothered by,

45:56.260 --> 46:00.900
what are their big problems in their lives because everybody's saying that all the time

46:00.900 --> 46:03.020
and most of us are just ignoring it.

46:03.020 --> 46:07.620
But if you take the time to listen, you know somebody at that point.

46:07.620 --> 46:08.620
Absolutely you do.

46:08.620 --> 46:12.780
Then you have to be able to dismiss it.

46:12.780 --> 46:15.860
You're looking for that just to see how I can manipulate that is what you're trying

46:15.860 --> 46:18.340
to do.

46:18.340 --> 46:22.020
The lady was one story, another truly despicable story.

46:22.020 --> 46:23.980
We'll get to script in a second.

46:23.980 --> 46:29.300
But another truly despicable story, we were one of the really first groups that started

46:29.300 --> 46:30.300
phishing attacks.

46:30.300 --> 46:31.580
What's phishing?

46:31.580 --> 46:33.500
So that is a social engineering attack.

46:33.500 --> 46:34.500
PH by the way.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.500
Yeah, PH.

46:35.500 --> 46:36.860
That's another social engineering attack.

46:36.860 --> 46:41.180
That's sending that fake email out that looks like it's coming from a website or your financial

46:41.180 --> 46:44.380
organization or whatever and saying, hey, we've got a security problem.

46:44.380 --> 46:47.220
We need you to update your account information.

46:47.220 --> 46:50.540
Back then, no one had ever seen a phishing attack.

46:50.540 --> 46:53.380
So you could ask for all the information.

46:53.380 --> 46:57.180
You were getting just complete identity profiles on a phishing email.

46:57.180 --> 46:58.380
Nowadays, you can't do that.

46:58.380 --> 47:02.180
Nowadays, you look for basically credentials because everyone is aware of phishing.

47:02.180 --> 47:03.900
But back then, it was complete information.

47:03.900 --> 47:09.700
We had phished out, I don't know, 200,000 E-Trade accounts as what we had the login

47:09.700 --> 47:10.700
credentials for.

47:10.700 --> 47:11.700
Login password, yeah.

47:11.700 --> 47:16.860
Login password, complete social, date of birth, mother's maiden, account information, everything

47:16.860 --> 47:17.860
else.

47:17.860 --> 47:20.540
So we had access to those E-Trade accounts.

47:20.540 --> 47:24.220
E-Trade initially had no security in place.

47:24.220 --> 47:30.020
So you could cash out the account, ACH the money out to whatever account you wanted to,

47:30.020 --> 47:31.020
went through just fine.

47:31.020 --> 47:34.500
Ate them alive on that for four to six months.

47:34.500 --> 47:41.340
E-Trade got to the point where you couldn't do any ACH coming out.

47:41.340 --> 47:42.540
They locked everything down.

47:42.540 --> 47:46.420
Well, you're still sitting on thousands of E-Trade accounts.

47:46.420 --> 47:47.820
How do you make money on that?

47:47.820 --> 47:50.340
That's a good question.

47:51.020 --> 47:56.020
Yeah, so what you do is you find some fat cat that's got his retirement invested in

47:56.020 --> 47:57.020
blue chips.

47:57.020 --> 48:01.900
At the same time, you find a penny stock, you open up a brand new account, buy into

48:01.900 --> 48:06.860
that penny stock, cash the fat cat out, buy into that same penny stock, bump and dump

48:06.860 --> 48:08.180
schemes all of a sudden.

48:08.180 --> 48:12.540
So you're destroying people's retirement accounts for just a few thousand dollars.

48:12.540 --> 48:13.820
Bam, bam, bam.

48:13.820 --> 48:18.500
And of course, E-Trade's response is, not our problem, it's your problem.

48:18.500 --> 48:21.660
You shouldn't have given up your password or what have you at that point.

48:21.660 --> 48:25.540
And you still see that issue today with Zelle scams and things like that.

48:25.540 --> 48:26.540
Which scam?

48:26.540 --> 48:27.540
Zelle.

48:27.540 --> 48:28.540
So, you know, the instant payment.

48:28.540 --> 48:32.580
So it's the same kind of operations with different payment mechanisms.

48:32.580 --> 48:38.180
You find an easy way to exploit a system and typically the financial organization, not

48:38.180 --> 48:39.180
our problem.

48:39.180 --> 48:40.260
Our system's secure.

48:40.260 --> 48:41.260
It's the humans.

48:41.260 --> 48:42.260
It's their errors.

48:42.260 --> 48:44.260
Well, not really.

48:44.260 --> 48:48.660
You've got some culpability in that, and you're just trying to avoid paying the part

48:48.660 --> 48:50.180
of the bill is what's going on.

48:50.180 --> 48:56.660
One of the things just to stand fishing for a bit is, it really makes me sad because there's

48:56.660 --> 49:02.580
been people on all kinds of platforms, including YouTube comments, but emails too, they figured

49:02.580 --> 49:04.720
out emails somehow.

49:04.720 --> 49:14.000
So people are now seeing the followers of this particular podcast, who are fans, they're

49:14.000 --> 49:20.700
finding them on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube and so on, and they are figuring out

49:20.700 --> 49:28.920
ways to get to those people by another channel, which I suppose seems more authentic to those

49:28.920 --> 49:29.920
people.

49:30.920 --> 49:38.640
So they send them an email from what looks like me, and with this, like loving, the interesting

49:38.640 --> 49:42.000
thing, the emails sound like something I would write.

49:42.000 --> 49:46.560
So these aren't even at this stage, it's not even, it doesn't feel automated, or if it's

49:46.560 --> 49:52.840
automated, there's a human in the loop that's really fine tuning at this specific, or maybe

49:52.840 --> 49:58.440
I'm very predictable, but it's very loving in the way I would write that message.

49:58.440 --> 50:03.300
So think about that, so when fishing first comes out, you could look at the language

50:03.300 --> 50:08.000
of the text or the website and say, if you were paying attention, that's so okay.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.720
So that's not an English speaker who wrote that typically.

50:11.720 --> 50:17.120
But as time has went on, as the awareness of what a fishing attack looks like, we have

50:17.120 --> 50:21.080
people that are sitting down now and making sure that the language is proper.

50:21.080 --> 50:24.320
It gets worse than that, though, if you look at business email compromise.

50:24.320 --> 50:29.960
So the way a business email compromise typically works is the attacker will find a payroll

50:29.960 --> 50:31.680
person, find a CEO.

50:31.680 --> 50:36.560
He will fashion a spearfishing email, which is that's a fishing attack that's targeting

50:36.560 --> 50:39.100
one specific individual.

50:39.100 --> 50:43.780
So he'll fashion a spearfishing email, and the way he does that is he pulls all the information

50:43.780 --> 50:49.680
he possibly can on that person, that CEO.

50:50.120 --> 50:57.640
He'll spear that CEO just to get their login credentials to their email, just to read the

50:57.640 --> 51:01.320
emails, and he'll go in there and he'll start reading all these emails.

51:01.320 --> 51:05.800
He'll specifically read the emails to the payroll department, see what that relationship

51:05.800 --> 51:06.800
is.

51:06.800 --> 51:07.800
Are they talking about their kids?

51:07.800 --> 51:08.800
Talking about relationships?

51:08.800 --> 51:09.800
Talking about vacations?

51:09.800 --> 51:10.800
What are they talking about?

51:10.800 --> 51:11.800
How are they talking?

51:11.800 --> 51:12.800
Are they friendly?

51:12.800 --> 51:13.800
Are they sterile?

51:13.800 --> 51:14.800
What are they doing?

51:14.800 --> 51:15.800
All right?

51:15.800 --> 51:18.840
So then he decides, well, I'm going to go ahead and spearfish the payroll department

51:18.840 --> 51:20.120
in his hood.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.680
So then he spearfishes him, gets those credentials.

51:22.680 --> 51:27.280
At the same time, he creates a Unicode domain in whatever the company name is.

51:27.280 --> 51:28.280
All right?

51:28.280 --> 51:31.920
So instead of that English alphabet I, he's got that Russian letter that looks like an

51:31.920 --> 51:33.840
I but without the dot on top.

51:33.840 --> 51:34.840
All right?

51:34.840 --> 51:41.460
It comes back into the email, into the payroll email, blocks the real CEO's email, replaces

51:41.460 --> 51:48.320
that with the Unicode email that he's got, and then sends out a message using the correct

51:48.320 --> 51:52.600
language, the correct relationships, everything else, and says, hey, you know, we're updating

51:52.600 --> 51:53.600
our account status.

51:53.600 --> 51:57.080
I need you to send this payment instead of this over here.

51:57.080 --> 51:58.280
They've set up a new account.

51:58.280 --> 51:59.960
Send all payments over here now.

51:59.960 --> 52:02.440
And that is business email compromise in a nutshell.

52:02.440 --> 52:03.440
All right?

52:03.440 --> 52:04.920
Works great.

52:04.920 --> 52:10.200
Probably the larger the organization, the more susceptible to that kind of attack because

52:10.200 --> 52:16.960
there's like a distribution of responsibility to where you're more likely to believe that,

52:16.960 --> 52:18.960
okay, this other person is responsible.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.960
I'm sure they secured everything.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.960
Absolutely.

52:21.960 --> 52:24.360
I'm okay listening to this.

52:24.360 --> 52:25.960
So that's business email compromise.

52:25.960 --> 52:29.520
And those crimes, and that's one of the things you see about cybercrime, cybercrime is not

52:29.520 --> 52:30.960
really sophisticated.

52:30.960 --> 52:31.960
It's not.

52:31.960 --> 52:32.960
The attacks are not sophisticated.

52:32.960 --> 52:38.360
The stat is 90% of every single attack uses a known exploit.

52:38.360 --> 52:41.160
It's not zero-day attacks.

52:41.160 --> 52:42.360
They're out there.

52:42.360 --> 52:46.840
But if you're a criminal waiting on a zero-day to profit, you're going to starve to death.

52:46.840 --> 52:50.400
The meat and potatoes are that 90%.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.400
Known exploits.

52:51.400 --> 52:57.720
And then the rest is what you're saying it's maybe you mean it's not technically sophisticated,

52:57.720 --> 53:00.000
but it's social engineering sophisticated.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.680
Very sophisticated on that end.

53:01.680 --> 53:02.680
Very sophisticated.

53:02.680 --> 53:08.360
It's a fascinating study of that establishment of trust and then using that trust to defraud

53:08.360 --> 53:09.800
that victim.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.160
That is something.

53:11.160 --> 53:16.640
I wish obviously all of these folks are really good at hiding.

53:16.640 --> 53:21.280
I wish you could tell their stories in a way, which is why you're fascinating is you're

53:21.280 --> 53:28.200
able to tell these stories now because it is studying human nature by exploiting it.

53:28.200 --> 53:36.680
But you get to understand like our weak points, our hope, our desire to trust others.

53:36.680 --> 53:44.680
Also sort of the weak points and the failures of digital systems and at scale humans have

53:44.680 --> 53:45.680
to connect.

53:46.120 --> 53:47.120
It's fascinating.

53:47.120 --> 53:52.840
This is a weird question asking for a friend.

53:52.840 --> 53:55.000
Is spear phishing itself illegal?

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
What's the legality here?

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Oh, it's all illegal.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Absolutely, it is.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Is it?

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Absolutely.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
So here's what.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.640
Okay, let me construct an example.

54:03.640 --> 54:13.340
So if my friend were to spear fish like a CEO and get their information and after they

54:13.340 --> 54:20.780
get control, say they have their Twitter account, they tweet something loving and positive.

54:20.780 --> 54:22.460
What's the crime?

54:22.460 --> 54:23.460
Unauthorized access of advice.

54:23.460 --> 54:27.860
What will be the punishment, do you think?

54:27.860 --> 54:29.620
That becomes questionable.

54:29.620 --> 54:33.220
So no monetary loss or was there a monetary loss?

54:33.220 --> 54:34.860
Probably not.

54:34.860 --> 54:38.260
So you have to figure out who the victim is before charges are pressed.

54:38.260 --> 54:47.020
Now the crime would be unauthorized access, but no real victim on that unless the person

54:47.020 --> 54:52.000
whose account you took over takes exception to that.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
No monetary loss.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.220
So there's not really standard fines?

54:55.220 --> 54:59.220
Probably nothing's going to happen.

54:59.220 --> 55:06.000
That's kind of interesting because when I got the ransomware, when I got the zero day

55:06.000 --> 55:18.480
attack on the QNAP mask, they basically say the criminal is QNAP, the company for having

55:18.480 --> 55:23.120
so many security vulnerabilities.

55:23.120 --> 55:26.500
You are the victim of QNAP's incompetence.

55:26.500 --> 55:27.920
That's the way they kind of phrase it.

55:27.920 --> 55:30.120
And see, I don't agree with that.

55:30.120 --> 55:32.060
I don't agree with that at all.

55:32.060 --> 55:42.100
So SolarWinds, so I've got a 130 page class action lawsuit printed out at the house.

55:42.100 --> 55:48.220
I've been going through it that catalogs how SolarWinds lied for years about their vulnerabilities

55:48.220 --> 55:50.240
and they lied to investors.

55:50.240 --> 55:56.720
The people who came in, the auditors who they would hire, they would not pay attention to

55:56.720 --> 56:00.500
them when they said, you know, you've got these issues, they would say, go away, shit

56:00.500 --> 56:07.300
like that for years until SolarWinds, you know, the attacks become apparent.

56:07.300 --> 56:14.380
My view on that is that the only person responsible for the crime are the criminals who did the

56:14.380 --> 56:18.020
attacking, the actual criminals, not SolarWinds.

56:18.020 --> 56:21.380
Now does that mean that SolarWinds isn't all fucked up?

56:21.380 --> 56:22.380
They are.

56:22.380 --> 56:25.860
And there needs to be some accounting in place.

56:26.860 --> 56:31.580
The only individual, the only people responsible for crime are the criminals.

56:31.580 --> 56:36.700
And that's either online, in the physical world, what have you.

56:36.700 --> 56:43.260
Being an idiot is not a crime.

56:43.260 --> 56:45.260
Being criminally negligent is.

56:45.260 --> 56:51.780
And I think that SolarWinds is certainly responsible, not responsible, they're culpable for what

56:51.780 --> 56:52.780
happened.

56:53.780 --> 57:00.100
Tell folks about SolarWinds, what is it, what are some interesting things that you're aware

57:00.100 --> 57:01.100
of?

57:01.100 --> 57:10.300
SolarWinds was very, it provided a backbone of security for hundreds, thousands of different

57:10.300 --> 57:12.460
companies.

57:12.460 --> 57:16.340
If you looked at a lot of security companies were using SolarWinds, that would allow you

57:16.340 --> 57:20.540
to get a snapshot of the entire system that they were working on.

57:20.540 --> 57:28.180
So what happens is, is you get a Russian group that comes in and they basically, they hack

57:28.180 --> 57:30.740
into SolarWinds and get access to it.

57:30.740 --> 57:37.860
And that allows them to view every single thing, I mean every single thing about every

57:37.860 --> 57:43.180
single client that SolarWinds had at that point.

57:43.180 --> 57:49.020
So entire snapshots of all the IP that was going on, all the emails, all the communications,

57:49.020 --> 57:51.880
every single secret that was going on with those companies.

57:51.880 --> 57:56.460
If a company had software like Microsoft, it allowed them to look at the source code

57:56.460 --> 57:57.860
of everything that was going on.

57:57.860 --> 58:03.860
I mean it's just a complete and total nightmare, all right, and something that you are not

58:03.860 --> 58:06.860
going to recover from.

58:06.860 --> 58:07.860
You're not.

58:07.860 --> 58:10.860
I mean it's done at that point.

58:10.860 --> 58:14.980
You know, there's not been a lot of news lately about it, but the fact of the matter is, is

58:14.980 --> 58:17.660
that's the type of attack that's a catastrophic attack.

58:17.940 --> 58:23.620
So there's a huge amount of information that was read, saved elsewhere probably.

58:23.620 --> 58:24.620
Oh yeah.

58:24.620 --> 58:27.220
And so now there's people sitting on information.

58:27.220 --> 58:28.220
Absolutely.

58:28.220 --> 58:33.940
So think about one of the attack vectors has been Microsoft Outlook 365, things like that.

58:33.940 --> 58:37.480
This allowed the attackers to look at the source codes of that.

58:37.480 --> 58:42.660
So they have the source code now, so they can go through it line by line, or other vulnerabilities.

58:42.660 --> 58:46.640
Let's find new vulnerabilities, new zero days, and you know I said zero days aren't common,

58:46.640 --> 58:50.120
but this opens up an entire new threat surface all of a sudden.

58:50.120 --> 58:52.640
So it's a completely catastrophic attack.

58:52.640 --> 58:56.320
Once all the chips are down, everything's tallied up, people are going to be like, yeah, we're

58:56.320 --> 58:57.320
done.

58:57.320 --> 58:58.320
We're done.

58:58.320 --> 58:59.320
Yeah.

58:59.320 --> 59:04.880
All right, this whole computer thing, we tried it, we're walking away.

59:04.880 --> 59:05.880
We're done.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.680
That's terrifying.

59:07.680 --> 59:15.200
So you're saying that there's not been obvious big negative impact from that yet, but like

59:15.440 --> 59:18.680
There's been a lot of negative impact, but we're just starting.

59:18.680 --> 59:22.560
So the capacity for destruction is huge here.

59:22.560 --> 59:27.120
How much involvement from nation states do you think there is on this?

59:27.120 --> 59:29.080
It's interesting.

59:29.080 --> 59:33.280
So you've got Iran, you've got North Korea, China, Russia, you got the big four.

59:33.280 --> 59:35.640
You also got Brazil.

59:35.640 --> 59:40.920
You've got all these other countries that are interested in the United States as well.

59:40.920 --> 59:44.080
Nation states are interesting depending on who the nation state is.

59:44.480 --> 59:45.480
All right.

59:45.480 --> 59:48.480
So Russia is very good about working with the type of criminal that I used to be.

59:48.480 --> 59:51.920
They'll enlist these guys and steal information, what have you.

59:51.920 --> 59:55.560
Then Russia will take the information they want to, and they'll basically go off and

59:55.560 --> 59:58.520
sell whatever you want to make some money.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.280
China's all about IP.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.160
North Korea is about stealing money because they really don't know what the hell else

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.040
to do right now.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.040
But

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.640
So North Korea is actively involved in cybercrime.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640
Absolutely.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.400
They've stolen a shitload of Bitcoin, everything else.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.280
So absolutely they're actively involved with that.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.200
Very skilled attackers, very skilled.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.640
But even if you look at, you know, I told you that stat about 90%, all right.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:31.920
So even though SolarWinds is going to be the number one attack, the follow up to that is

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.400
this Notpedia attack that happened.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:39.280
And so that was the most sophisticated attack launched by the Russian Sandworm Group using

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.780
all known exploits throughout.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:47.380
So it's not, again, it's not, you're right in the sophistication is typically not technical

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:51.020
sophistication, but it's that social engineering sophistication.

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:56.300
How do you get these things put together in line to attack and succeed?

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:59.660
But when you get access to the source code, that's where technical sophistication could

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:01.180
really do a lot of damage.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.340
And that's when you find out real quick, that's what separates the men from the boys in this

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.340
game.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.620
All right, because all of a sudden it's not, I don't have to worry about social engineering.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.060
And I've got source codes and I've got professionals that are looking at that.

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.340
And that's your ass.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.820
Which then enables probably even more powerful social engineering methods too.

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:28.740
I mean, it's just a cascade of, is this terrifying to you, by the way, that this world that we're

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:37.820
living in, as we put more and more of ourselves on the internet into the metaverse, that there

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.500
is so many more attack vectors on our wellbeing.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:49.140
What's terrifying to me, I used to preach it on Shadow Crew, is the idea that the perception

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:52.980
of truth is more important than the truth itself.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.500
It doesn't matter what the facts are, it matters what I can convince you of.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.300
That's what's terrifying to me.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:04.780
So you look at deep fakes, you look at fake news, all this stuff that's going out, that

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:10.180
becomes truly terrifying.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:16.900
Maybe there's an angle where it's freeing if nothing is true and you can't trust anything.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.300
But you see, we as human beings, we want to trust.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:26.620
We do, we need human interaction and for that human interaction, you have to have a degree

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.620
of trust.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:33.820
But it's more like you let go of an idea of absolute truth and it more becomes like a

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.300
blockchain style consensus.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:43.940
So you let go of like, you know what, there's this human dream, you get this on the internet,

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:49.740
you get like facts, as if there's at the bottom, at the bottom, there's one turtle that's holding

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:54.780
this like scroll that says, these are the truths of the world.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:59.740
The problem is, I mean, maybe believing that is counterproductive.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:05.140
Maybe human civilization is an ongoing process of consensus.

01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:10.100
And so it's always going to be, everything is shrouded in, you can call them lies or

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:14.300
you can call them inaccuracies or you can call them delusions.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:19.780
It's constantly going to be, it's going to be a sea of lies and delusions.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:25.620
But our hope is to over time, develop bigger and bigger islands of consensus that allows

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.960
us to live a stable and happy society.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.460
Don't call it true.

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:36.380
Call it a stable consensus that creates a high quality of life for the inhabitants of

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.380
the island.

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.380
I like it.

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.820
I mean, I like it.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:40.820
We're going to agree on this.

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:41.820
And then don't use outlook.

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.500
No, I'm just kidding.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.740
So maybe a step back, you mentioned, I'd love to talk about ShadowCrew.

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.820
Maybe this is the right time to actually, yeah, let's go to ShadowCrew because it's

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.820
such a fascinating story.

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:57.700
So tell me the story of building ShadowCrew, the precursor to today's darknet and darknet

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.700
markets.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.140
This is why you're the original godfather.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.140
This is it.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.140
This is it.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.580
So I get married.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:10.260
I faked a car accident to get married, got the money from that.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.260
You're romantic.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.260
I'm romantic.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.260
It's like my dad, man.

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:16.820
I'm the guy that, you know, I get from mom, I get the criminal mindset.

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:22.540
From dad, I get that, don't want him to leave.

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:27.140
To get married, what's that story?

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.140
Oh, dude.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.740
How did you fall in love there?

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:35.100
My first girlfriend was a preacher's daughter and crazy over her, dated her for five years

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:40.620
and she figured out pretty quickly that, well, not quickly, it took her five years to figure

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:45.100
out that Brett Johnson is not the man of God.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:52.440
I could talk it, but you know, more that agnostic than anything, she breaks up with me.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.020
So I was at the community college.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.660
You'd make one hell of a preacher by the way.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:05.460
Yeah, I've got that Langston Hughes problem, you know, I'm looking for Jesus to show up

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:09.020
and he just doesn't.

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.980
So I was, I was at the community college and I was, I was a straight asshole.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:17.940
I was arrogant, conceited, everything else, and I had posted an advertisement on one of

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:22.620
the billboards looking for an adult babysitter, hot blonde, you know, come, come visit me

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:24.260
in the library.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.300
A buddy of mine shows up and he's like, Brett, and I was like, yeah, he's like the hottest

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.020
girl in school right down the hall.

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.020
And I was like, serious?

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.020
He's like, yeah.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:36.140
And I was like, let's go see walk over and there's, there's these two guys that are

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.460
hitting on her.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:42.380
So I'm, I just walk up and me and Todd, that was my buddy walk up and I'm just sitting

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:45.220
there and listening and they're, you know, they're giving the spill and everything and

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.580
she's just kind of taken down.

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:50.940
Finally, I looked over and I was like, you want to get out of here?

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:54.140
And one of the guys looks at me, he's like, Hey, we're talking to it.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.980
I was like, well, you're talking at her.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:56.980
You're not talking to her.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:59.020
I'm about to save her ass from you.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.020
Yeah.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.540
And there's a smooth pickup line, by the way, if I ever heard one, that's good.

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:04.300
You want to get out of here?

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:06.420
So start dating.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:11.140
And she was the girl that screwed my brains out, man.

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.180
And I fell head over heels.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:16.180
We got married six months later, six months.

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.260
That's what love does.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.620
That's what it does.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:22.900
And I had, I was, she didn't know I was a crook.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.900
She had no idea.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.340
You know, she knew I was very bright.

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:30.620
She knew I did a lot of theater, stuff like that.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.820
Got a job at, I was in hazard.

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.420
There was no jobs to be had.

01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:38.580
So I got a job in Lexington because we were going to be moving to UK.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:44.580
Got a job in Lexington at Lexmark testing printer boards, circuit boards.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:50.780
So I would leave on a Thursday night, work three 18 hour shifts at Lexmark, come back

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.380
home on Monday.

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:58.820
Got married, faked a car accident to get the other, the rest of the money that I needed

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:02.260
to get married.

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:08.300
And the faking on that, man, I had bought a Chevy Spectrum at a car auction, gave like

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.900
500 bucks for it.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:15.300
My aunt had previously defrauded USAA insurance on a car accident.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:19.020
And she was telling me all about, she's like, look, go down to this chiropractor, make sure

01:07:19.020 --> 01:07:21.340
you get the insurance where they'll pay for a rental car.

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:22.340
They'll pay lost wages.

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:23.820
And I was like, they pay lost wages?

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:25.540
She's like, yeah, they pay lost wages.

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.540
I was like, hmm.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.140
She's like, by the way, you work for me.

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.540
And I was like, I work for you.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:36.740
And you get to define them with the wage and you can also define how long you were unable

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:37.740
to work.

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.740
Exactly.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:40.500
Chiropractor will sign off on any damn thing.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.500
All right.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:46.860
So my cousin, Ronnie, he figures out that I'm going, he finds out I'm going to fake

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:47.860
this car accident.

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:48.860
So he comes to me.

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:49.860
He's like, Hey, man, can I get in on that?

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:51.500
I was like, yeah, man, you get on that.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.080
So this kid, he's five days younger than I am.

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.420
This kid, he goes to the dentist the day that we're faking it, has a tooth pulled, tells

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:02.860
the dentist not to numb it, not to stitch it, just pull it.

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:04.740
He shows up.

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.140
He shows up the day that we're driving out to fake the accident.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.340
He's got blood all over his shirt.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.900
He's still bleeding out of the mouth and everything else.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:10.900
I'm like, are you okay?

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:11.900
He's like, yeah, man, it's going to be good.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:12.900
It's going to be good.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:13.900
I'm like, okay.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.380
So my mom, by this point, I'm living with my grandparents.

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:20.420
My mom is up in the head of a hollow.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.980
So we're like, we'll just do it up there.

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:26.660
We'll go act like we're visiting my mom on the way back out, ran over a mountain.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.660
Okay.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:32.420
So we go visit and everything, come back out that night, run over the side of the hill.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.780
Me and Ronnie walk back up.

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:38.000
Of course it totals the car, walk back to my mom's acting like we've wrecked.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.920
She knows what time it is and everything else and follow the claims.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:49.400
So that gets the money to get married and me and my wife move from Hazard to Lexington.

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:58.720
And I'm the kid that my crime, usually, if I was a single guy, wouldn't break the law.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:04.120
I would be all right, you know, but females involved, oh yeah, oh yeah, I got to spend

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.120
the money.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.120
You got to show them gifts.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.640
was never enough to show love in some sort of healthy way.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.640
Always had to go overboard.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.240
And typically it was buying some or stealing some sort of expensive crap that was the thing

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.840
that was the way you show love is by buying expensive gifts or something overboard.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.520
Back then with Susan, initially it was, don't worry about working.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.900
I got it.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.900
You just worry about going to school.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:28.900
She was a music major.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:31.760
I was like, you just worry about going to school.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.000
So don't worry about cooking and cleaning.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I got it.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I got it.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.320
Not only was I this guy that was going overboard, but I was kind of a control freak too, right?

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.320
So now I got it.

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.320
I got it.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.320
I got it.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:49.040
So here I am, you know, 60 hour a week job, 18 hour class load, cooking, cleaning, something

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.360
had to give.

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.360
I quit the job.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.360
I couldn't do it.

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:57.960
Quit the job and start back in fraud and trying to hide that from her at the same time.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:02.640
So it was initially telemarketing fraud started.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:08.960
I was working, the first job I had was a telemarketer at a cemetery selling grave sites.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:14.640
And then that ended, went over to work for the Shriner's Circus, Shriner's Hospital.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.320
And it was a third party company that was doing all the telemarketing, made really good

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.840
money doing that.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:25.680
That job ended and then they pivoted over to working with Kiwanis clubs, selling food

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.360
baskets to the food banks and everything.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:36.800
So I stole the phone list and started at my own Kiwanis club and would do the telemarketing,

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.960
go out twice a week and pick up checks.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:46.440
Well, what happened was, is I'm going out, picking up checks, go knock on a door.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:50.880
Turns out one of the persons that I had called was a law enforcement officer.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.880
So he was like, who are you?

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:58.240
I'm like, I'm with the Kiwanis club and he's like, no, you're not.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.360
Got arrested, spent three months in a county jail for theft by deception.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:11.040
Got out and we had to move from Lexington back to Hazard and live with Susan's parents.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:18.880
They had gotten a desktop computer, HP, and I started surfing around online.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.280
Found eBay and didn't really know how to make money on eBay.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:28.360
At about the same time, I'm committing low level frauds online.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.640
I don't really talk about that in the past.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.880
The first time I've really talked about that, but I would pay for it with bad checks.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.280
So more persons, so not using a platform like eBay and more.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.320
I would find somebody that had like a stereo system on eBay, something like that, and I'd

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.800
pay for it with bad check and would rely on them not to chase me because they were out

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.080
of state at that point and the dollar amounts were very low.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.520
So got the money to move to, finally did those schemes enough to get the money to move back

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.920
to Lexington.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.520
Got to Lexington and by this point, I'm doing this.

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.280
Like I said, these schemes on eBay and I'm like, there's got to be a better way to make

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.280
money on eBay.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.280
Got to be.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.640
So didn't really know how.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:18.960
One night I'm watching Inside Edition with Bill Riley and they're profiling Beanie Babies.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.760
So I'm sitting there watching and the one they're profiling is this one called Peanut,

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.720
the Royal Blue Elephant, selling for $1,500 on eBay.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.560
I'm sitting there going like, shit, I need to find me a peanut.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.600
My initial thought was, well, there's got to be one of these hallmark stores in Kentucky

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:35.600
someplace.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.120
So I skipped class the next day, went out around all the hallmark stores looking for

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.120
peanut.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.120
No idiot.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.880
He's on eBay for $1,500.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:51.000
So after a few hours of that, I'm like, hmm, turns out they had a little gray Beanie Baby

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.960
Elephants for $8.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.720
Picked up one of those for $8, stopped by Kroger on the way home, picked up a pack of

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.800
blue-rit dye, went home, tried to dye the little guy, so that was a nightmare.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.840
Turns out they're made out of polyester.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.720
Get them out of the bath, looks like they've got the mange.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.160
And what happens is, so I'm trying to dye the damn thing and I'm like, well, that's

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.160
not going to work.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.640
That's just not going to work.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.240
So I got online, found a picture of a real one, posted it on eBay and I was like, well,

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.960
what I can do is, I can claim that's the one I've got and then maybe claim that it got

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.400
messed up in the mail and work out like that.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.740
So posted a picture of a real one online, woman thought I had the real thing.

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:35.680
She wins the bid.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.440
That social engineering kicks in immediately.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.440
I didn't want to be on the defensive.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.440
I wanted to put her on the defensive.

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.600
So as soon as she wins the bid, I send her a message, hey, we've not done any business

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.600
before.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600
I don't even know if I can trust you.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.600
What I need you to do, protects us both, go down to the U.S. Postal Service, get two

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:57.600
money orders totaling $1,500, send them to me, issued by the U.S. government.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.600
That way we're both protected.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.680
As soon as I get the money orders, I'll send you your animal.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680
She believed that.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.800
Didn't ask any questions at all.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.160
She believed that.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160
Sent me the money orders.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.840
I cashed them out.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.560
Send her the creature, immediately got a phone call.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:13.880
I didn't order this.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.720
My response, lady, you ordered a blue elephant.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:24.000
I sent you a blue fish, elephant, and she got pissed and she kept calling.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.920
What I found out, and that's really the first lesson of cyber crime that most of these criminals,

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.200
including self, learns.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.880
If you delay a victim long enough, just keep putting them off.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:35.580
A lot of them, they get exasperated, throw their hands in the air, walk away.

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:36.960
You don't hear from them.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.520
None of them, to this day, none of them complain to law enforcement.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.520
They eat it.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:48.760
So it's a mixture of like you're exhausted by the process, so it's just easier to walk

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.200
away, and second, almost like an embarrassment.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.080
So there's a whole slew of reasons, all right?

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:56.920
There's exhaustion, certainly.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.920
There's the embarrassment.

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:01.000
So if you figure out, if you look at it today, where does the embarrassment come from?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.560
Well, the media, family members, were all very good about blaming the victim for crimes.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.640
Why would you click on the link?

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.400
Why would you send money to somebody you don't know?

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.400
Blah, blah, blah.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400
So you've got that that's going on.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.840
You've got the issue of who do you complain to?

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840
Back then, you didn't know.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.440
Do you complain to local police?

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:22.640
Because she's in another state, so which local police do you complain to?

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.640
Do you complain to the feds?

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.200
Well, the dollar amounts aren't high enough to complain to feds.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.400
The feds are going to tell you to go local.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.040
Local's going to tell you, hey, it happened in Kentucky.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040
Complain to them.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.120
Kentucky's going to tell you, well, shit, you're over there.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.120
We need you to come in.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.240
There's this whole issue, the jurisdiction of the blame factor, everything else.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.200
So I got away with that crime and did it under my own name.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.360
At that point, I kept going and got better at it.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.440
Started to understand how to hide identities, things like that.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.640
Started selling pirated software.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.360
Pirated software led into installing mod chips.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.600
It was for the initial pirated software was Sega Saturn, PlayStation 1.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.480
Well, you had to have a mod chip in those to play the pirated disk.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.840
So I started selling and installing mod chips.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.440
That led into installing mod chips into cable television boxes so

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.880
you could watch all the pay-per-view.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:18.160
Which in turn led into programming satellite DSS cards.

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.040
Those ATNH RCA satellite systems pull the card out of it,

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.600
program it, turns on all the channels.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.920
Started doing that.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.160
Can we just pause?

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.400
Mm-hm.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.800
That is very entrepreneurial.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:39.080
So just technically, so

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:43.360
there's laws and rules that you're breaking nonstop.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:47.280
So there's also legitimate ways of doing that,

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.920
which is break the rules of the conventions of the past.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.360
That's the first principles thing.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.440
That's what Elon Musk and his ilk do all the time.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:59.560
That is guts and brilliance.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.120
But when it's crossing the lines of the law,

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.280
actually sometimes the law is outdated.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:12.560
The thing is as a human being you have to then compute the ethical damage you're

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.200
doing, like ethically the damage you're doing about other human beings.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.480
That is fundamentally the thing that you're breaking is you're adding to

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:24.240
the suffering in the world in one way or another and you're justifying it.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:29.480
But in terms of me sort of as an engineer, that is some gutsy thinking.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.960
That's how Woz and Steve Jobs thought.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:33.640
Sure.

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.760
That's innovation.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:41.640
And maybe just think, if you can introspect your thinking process here,

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.320
this is a new, I like how you remember that it's in an HP.

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.200
Like this is a totally new thing to you.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.680
Computers is yet another domain.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.120
How are you figuring these puzzles out?

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.400
Presumably mostly alone?

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.040
Alone.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.240
When you were thinking through these problems, is there,

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:08.720
this is a strange question to ask, but what is your thinking process?

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.160
What is your approach to solving these problems?

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.800
So the approach is you do something and you fuck it up.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.640
And you're like, you think back, okay, how do I fix that?

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.880
So you fix that aspect, you commit the crime again.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.720
And it goes a little bit further and it screws up.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.640
Okay, how do I fix that?

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:29.520
What's the issue on that?

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.280
How do I fix that?

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.920
So there's not a deep design thinking like-

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.920
Later on it becomes that.

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.320
Once you lay that groundwork of the way these schemes are working, all right?

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.120
It becomes that.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:44.520
And you can apply that to other things in cybercrime as a whole, all right?

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.600
But initially, it's basically trial and error.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.960
So you've got a problem, how do you solve that problem, all right?

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.320
So how do I, I'm committing these crimes under my name, how do I solve that?

01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.440
Well, one of the first principles that we started to teach on Shadow Crew is

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:04.120
all crimes should begin with identity theft.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.040
That's one of the main first principles that a lot of people to this day still

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.800
don't really get, all right?

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.280
Why would I commit a crime under my name if I can do it under your name?

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.960
So that's one of the big buffers.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.560
It takes trial and error to get to that point where you start to understand

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.960
that's the way crime should operate if you're a criminal, all right?

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:25.120
But with me, it was, I mean, it's trial and error.

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:30.120
It's that childhood where that mindset is kind of ingrained in you,

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:35.240
where you're looking for ways, let's say non-traditional ways

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.040
of getting around things or getting through things.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.200
I mean, one of the questions, I'll probably ask this later,

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.240
there's also a unique aspect to the outcome of what you were doing,

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:49.760
which is you weren't, you didn't get caught for a very long time.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.520
Right.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.040
We'll talk about why that is.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.000
And the thing is, it's so interesting.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:01.000
All crime probably should, to be effective, should start with identity theft.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:01.400
Right.

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.200
I like that identity theft because identity theft can take so many forms.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.880
Right, right.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:09.120
So yes, so Shadow Crew.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.200
So what's, so as we're, you started with love.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.360
Started with love, so now we're, you know, doing these schemes online.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.960
I'm selling, I'm selling to these, I'm programming these satellite DSS cards.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.000
And you, one of the interesting things, and you still see that to this day,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:33.440
is something will happen that will create an industry for criminals, all right?

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:38.400
So what happened is, Canada, Canadian judge rules about the same time

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:42.000
that I'm doing these satellite cards, Canadian judge comes out and says,

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:47.520
Hey, it's legal for my citizens to pirate those signals.

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.440
And his reasoning was, since RCA doesn't sell the systems up here,

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.840
my citizens can pirate it.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:59.640
OK, so what happens is overnight, about the same time, PayPal comes into play.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:03.280
So PayPal is coming right online at about the same time.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:07.200
Overnight, a little cottage industry pops up in the United States.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:10.600
You go down to Best Buy, buy the system for $100, take it out in the parking lot,

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.600
open system up, pull it, open box up, pull the system out, pull the card out,

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.840
throw the system away, program the card, ship its ass to Canada, $500 a pop.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.880
Started doing that.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.480
Business is good.

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.680
Making, you know, $3,000, $4,000 a week doing that.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.000
I'm like, yeah, that's good.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.960
I have so many orders, I can't fill all the orders.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:33.720
And quickly think to myself, why do I need to fill any of them?

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.960
They're in Canada.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:37.120
I'm down here.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.120
You know, who are they going to complain to?

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.920
Because I already found out people don't complain, all right?

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.160
They're not going to complain to anybody.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.840
So I start not- Especially in Canada.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.960
Especially in Canada.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.640
And I'm having them send money.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.080
That's when PayPal's first into play.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:58.080
And it amazes me that everybody is using PayPal.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.400
It's like, you don't even have to really ask.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.440
They're like, can we pay by?

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.280
Yeah, you can pay all day long by PayPal.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.880
And PayPal had no clue what they were doing with security.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.320
So it's like, okay.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.840
So they're sending money to PayPal.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.960
I'm having the PayPal cashed out to bank accounts in my name

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.560
at that point.

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.440
And I get scared because by that point,

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.120
I'm still in $4,000 to $6,000 a week.

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.480
And I'm like, somebody's going to be looking at money laundering.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.960
So get it in my head.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.920
I'm like, best thing that I can do is get a fake driver's license,

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.160
open up a bank account using that driver's license,

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.240
cash out of the ATM.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:33.880
Good.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.440
No idea where to get a fake ID.

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.480
Not a clue.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.400
So I get online, looked around, spent a couple of weeks

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.480
looking around, thought I found a guy.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:44.720
He went by the screen name of Fake ID Man.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:47.640
Thought I found a guy, sent him $200, sent him my picture.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.800
Dude rips me off.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:53.440
And I'm like, what the hell, man?

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.720
Oh, I got played.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:57.920
He had a little website set up with reviews.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.400
And I'm like, oh, it's all legitimate.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.800
It's building that trust that I talked about.

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:06.160
So the end result, I got pissed.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.400
And there was no site that dealt with anything

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.040
criminal or cybercrime related.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:17.080
The only real avenue you had was an IRC chat session,

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.560
internet relay chat.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.800
And I'm sure you've been on that.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.840
It's this rolling chat board.

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.760
You don't know who the hell you're talking to.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.040
Most of them are full of shit.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.280
You can't trust anybody.

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.480
And you're sitting there trying to conduct business.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:32.200
So if somebody claims they've got a product or service,

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:32.840
do they have it?

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.400
Does it work?

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.360
Or are they just going to rip you off?

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.800
Because in those channels, everyone is a criminal.

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:40.960
I kept looking around.

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:44.600
And I've happened upon a website called Counterfeit Library.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.120
And Counterfeit Library only dealt with counterfeit degrees

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.720
and certificates, degree mail type stuff.

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:53.520
But they had a forum.

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.320
And no one was using the forum.

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.400
So I basically get on there and bitch every day.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.600
I got ripped off, don't know what to do, bam, bam, bam, bam.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.360
About the same time I started doing that,

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.880
two other guys show up.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.400
One's named Mr. X. He's out of Los Angeles.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.760
The other guy's named Biel Zbub.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.880
He's out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.640
And we all become buddies.

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.800
So a few weeks of me bitching, a few weeks of them responding.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.680
Biel Zbub gets me on ICQ.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.840
And he sends me a message.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.600
He's like, I went by the screen name of Gollum

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.120
at that point, Gollum Fun.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.200
He's like, Gollum, I can make you a fake driver's license.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.640
And I was like, well, motherfucker, do it.

01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.640
And he's like, well, I'm gonna charge you for it.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.320
I'm like, yeah, you are.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.880
He's like, I am.

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:35.480
I was like, no, you're not.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.000
And he's like, look, man, he said,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.240
this business, if you're gonna do this,

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.120
you have to trust people or you're gonna fail.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.720
He said, so I'm gonna charge you $200,

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.000
but I'm gonna send you a driver's license.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.080
Well, by this point, I'm friends with the people

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:53.080
who own Counterfeit Library.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.640
We're emailing, chatting, everything else.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.560
And I tell him, I'm like, okay, I'm gonna send you $200.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.360
That way, when you rip me off, I'll have them ban you

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.000
and I don't have to deal with you anymore.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:04.880
And he's like, bet.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.360
I'm like, okay.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.880
So I sent him $200, sent him my picture.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.680
Two weeks later, I get a driver's license.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.720
Name is Steven Schwecki out of Ohio.

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.360
And real guy, worked at ADP payroll to this day,

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.760
works at ADP, is where the guy works.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.560
Got the driver's license.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.240
And to me, at that point in time,

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.200
it was the prettiest thing that I'd ever seen.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.440
I'd never seen a fake ID before.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.720
I thought it was great.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:33.280
Turns out, looking back, it was like, eh.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.520
It is a kind of a strong first step

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.440
in creating a fake identity.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.040
Very strong, very strong.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.480
So that was like,

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:51.160
Gasco was just on the point he made

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.320
that if you're gonna be successful in this,

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.880
you should have people you trust.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:57.960
Is he right on that?

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.040
Oh, he's absolutely right.

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:00.880
He's absolute.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.640
So you have to have, this is like mob.

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.720
You have to have an inner circle that you trust.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.280
I'm sure you've probably heard me say this before.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.520
Successful cyber crime, all right.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:17.560
There are three necessities to being successful online

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.520
if you're a criminal.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.080
Three necessities are gathering data,

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.240
committing the crime, and then cashing it out.

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.720
All three of those necessities have to work in conjunction.

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.440
If they don't, the crime fails.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.760
The problem, and it's a huge problem,

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.080
is that one guy can't do all three things.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.040
You've got the people who gather the data.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.680
Basically, the general store sells people

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.480
who sell PII, credit card logins, data tools.

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.240
They always sell the spoofed phone numbers

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.560
and the RDPs, stuff like that.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.800
A lot of the times, those people don't know

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.080
how to commit the crime.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.200
And those people certainly don't know

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.640
how to launder the money out and put cash in pocket.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.000
So you've got, either because of a skill level,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.160
sometimes a geographic location,

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.240
limits what that individual can do, all right.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:06.600
So you have to rely on people who are good in areas

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:10.640
where you are not in order for that crime to succeed.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.360
And that means you have to trust those people.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:17.760
So what happens with Shadow Crew, all right.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:20.000
So Counterfeit Library is the start, all right.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:24.520
Counterfeit Library transitions over to Shadow Crew.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.880
Right before that transition, there's a Ukrainian guy

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:29.640
by the name of Dmitry Golubov.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.240
He was a spammer at that point in time.

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.440
He saw what we were doing with Counterfeit Library

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.960
and he liked it.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.760
He was getting all these credit card details

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.960
and this kid, I mean, he's a kid.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:42.240
This kid has an idea and his idea was,

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.240
I wonder if people would buy stolen credit card details.

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.600
It's pretty good Ukrainian Russian accent.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:52.240
So he picks up the phone, he calls his buddies.

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.320
They call their buddies.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:56.280
They have a physical conference in Odessa.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.480
150 of these cyber criminals show up.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:00.200
And they launched this idea,

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.120
they launched a website called Carter Planet,

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.080
which is the genesis of all modern credit card theft

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.480
as we know it, all right.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:10.680
So remember I mentioned those three necessities

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:11.520
of cyber crime.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.040
Dmitry had all the credit data in the world

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.800
and he partnered with all these other Ukrainians

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.560
who had all this data as well.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.240
The problem was that so much fraud had been committed

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.120
on that Eastern side of Europe

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.480
that every card had been shut down.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.880
Even if you were a legitimate card holder

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.120
and tried to cash it out,

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.040
you weren't doing it at that point.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.720
So again, those three necessities,

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:35.840
gathering data, committing crime, cashing out.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.520
Dmitry had the data.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.960
They could commit the crime.

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.640
They could not put cash in pocket.

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.480
So we were running counterfeit library.

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.120
One day I get this message,

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.840
or not a message, one day script shows up.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.960
And he posts just on the general forum.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.280
He posts, hey, I've got credit card data.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.640
Give me an address, give me a burner phone number,

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.920
wait five business days, order whatever you want to.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.360
We had never seen anything like that.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.640
We were a PayPal fraud and eBay fraud site

01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:06.240
is what we were and fake driver's licenses.

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:07.520
So then, and we had,

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.920
I guess we had two, 3000 members at that point.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:14.920
So the response from the members was that can't be real.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:17.560
You've got to be law enforcement.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.520
It's got to be in trying to get us arrested

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.040
and everything else.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.360
What, let me backtrack a little bit.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.120
So the driver's license that I had got,

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:28.800
Bielzabub had an idea.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:33.360
What he wanted to do is he wanted to sell driver's licenses.

01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.520
Mr. X wanted to sell social security cards.

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:39.080
He made a very passable social security card.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.840
Me, I didn't, I had no skill level on that.

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.760
I knew PayPal fraud and eBay fraud.

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:47.240
So Bielzabub was like, tell you what, you be the reviewer.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:50.000
That way you get every product or service that comes in.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.920
They'll have to send it to you or let you have access to it.

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:55.360
You can learn the entire game.

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:57.760
And because you're not selling anything,

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.400
it gives you legitimacy on the reviews.

01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.520
All right, so I started out as a reviewer.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.560
The only reviewer on Counterfeit Library.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.680
So over the next year, Bielzabub,

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.080
turns out he was a pot grower.

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:11.760
He goes back to growing pot

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.400
because he wasn't making shit selling driver's licenses.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.600
Mr. X, about a year and a half in, he gets arrested

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.480
cashing out drivers, credit card, not credit cards,

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:24.160
cashing out to casinos, doing some shit with that.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.120
So I'm the only guy left standing

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.520
and I'm at the top of the heap.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.960
So, and it becomes this thing where if I review somebody,

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:33.840
they make a lot of money.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.680
If I don't, you don't do business here.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.760
So Script shows up saying he's got this.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.480
I'm the only reviewer on site.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:43.920
People think he's law enforcement.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.480
First week it goes like that.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.280
After a while, I'm like, okay, I gotta do something.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.200
And I'm scared, man,

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:50.520
cause I'm like, he may be law enforcement.

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.160
So I get him on ICQ and I'm like, hey,

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.080
you have to be reviewed.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.720
He's like, what the hell is that?

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.640
So I tell him what it is.

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:56.800
He's like, you review me.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.480
I was like, yeah, that's the idea.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.000
So give him a drop address, give him a burner phone number.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.360
Wait five business days.

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.760
And I try to hit Dell for $5,000.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.080
The order fails.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.360
I get back on ICQ.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.320
Hey man, it didn't work.

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.920
He's like, give me one more chance.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.680
I was like, look, I'll give you one more chance,

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.000
but it's your ass after that.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.640
And he's like, one more chance.

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:20.000
Like, okay, give him another address, another phone number.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.320
Wait another five business days.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:25.240
Hit Thompson's Computer Warehouse for $4,000.

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.840
Dell for $5,000.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.800
Order goes through, get the products in.

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.840
I posted that review on Counterfeit Library.

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.560
And literally overnight,

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:38.240
we turned from an eBay PayPal fraud site

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:39.960
to a credit theft site.

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:44.120
And that becomes a lot of money really quickly for members.

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.680
So we were doing, now it's called CMP fraud,

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.680
card not present fraud.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:51.240
So you hit an online merchant with stolen credit card data.

01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:54.520
Back then, a fairly experienced fraudster

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:58.600
could profit $30,000 to $40,000 a month, okay?

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.680
Just buying laptops, what have you, and cashing out,

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.840
put them on eBay for sale and sell them like that.

01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:06.800
And $30,000 to $40,000 a month was the profit on that.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.480
Script had a lot of buddies.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:10.960
He had people like Roman Vega,

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.080
these other guys that would sell not just credit card data,

01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:17.280
but counterfeit physical credit cards as well.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.520
We had-

01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.040
Counterfeit, not stolen.

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:20.960
So counterfeit.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:22.560
Counterfeit.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.120
That must be tough to do.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:25.960
So the connections-

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.800
That must be harder than-

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.640
It's crazy.

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:28.800
It's crazy.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:32.680
So what BOA initially had,

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:37.080
and I became the United States salesperson for BOA.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.160
But what he had was,

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:42.360
is he was the first dumps provider in the United States.

01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:44.480
So on the back of your credit or debit card,

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:47.000
there's a magnetic stripe.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.320
Three data tracks on the stripe.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.280
There was the first data track is customer's name,

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.520
second data track is the card number,

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.960
forward slash 16 digit algorithm outside of that.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:56.800
That's important.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.440
We'll get back to that in a few minutes.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.480
Third data track is called indiscriminate data.

01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:01.440
No one uses it.

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:05.680
So what's bought and sold is the second data track.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.840
It's called the dump.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:10.040
And the reason that's sold is when you go into a shop,

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:12.760
you insert the card or you swipe the card,

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.280
the only information that's sent out for verification

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:17.240
is the second data track.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.720
That goes to the processor bank for verification.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.600
The first data track that customer's name

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.600
shows up on the screen of the cashier in front of you.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.360
So what typically happens is,

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:28.160
is you buy 10 of these dumps,

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.520
you get 10 counterfeit cards,

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.360
encode track two on all 10 cards.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.280
Track one, you create one fake driver's license.

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:36.640
Track one is just the name

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.120
of that one fake driver's license.

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.480
That way, when you go in the shop,

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.040
swipe the card, track two gets sent off for verification.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.880
Track one shows up on the screen in front of the cashier.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:47.560
If you ever asked for ID, you pull out the fake ID.

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:48.840
Everyone's a nice warm fuzzy.

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:51.200
You walk out with the cameras, Rolex.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.840
And track one could be,

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.080
it doesn't have to be connected.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:55.080
It's not connected to track two.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:56.280
Not connected at all.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.840
That's one of the big problems, all right?

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:04.840
So, Script brought a host of technical people

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.960
into that type of environment,

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.480
all committing credit card theft.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.160
We had proxy providers.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.040
We had all these people that were doing this stuff.

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:15.520
We start making a lot of money, a lot.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.600
And the reason that happens is, again,

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:21.120
Script did not have the ability to cash out.

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.560
So he was reduced to selling things.

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.120
And at the same time, he's looking for,

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.120
how do I make more money, all right?

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.480
The Ukrainians happened upon this thing

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:34.360
called the CVV-1 breach, or hack,

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.080
is what they called it.

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:39.080
So what happens is, remember I told you track two.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.400
Card number, forward slash 16-digit algorithm.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.280
You gotta know the algorithm to encode it,

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.320
so you can swipe the card or take it to the ATM machine.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.280
All right, ATM.

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:52.760
You gotta know it.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.800
Now we were fishing data from hell.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.560
I mean, we were doing a lot of fishing, a lot.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:01.320
We were getting pins, we were getting card numbers,

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.640
but you can't get that algorithm.

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.840
So the Ukrainians start testing stuff.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.840
What they found out was,

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:13.600
no bank had implemented the hash on track two.

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.560
So you take the card number forward slash any 16 digits,

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.320
it would encode.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.800
Take it to the ATM, pull cash out,

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.240
because you got the pin, all right?

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.280
Started doing that.

01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.640
Well, wait, sorry, I'm trying to understand.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:32.920
So that means, so if there's no,

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.640
are they generating random numbers,

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.080
or do they have valid numbers for track two?

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.320
No numbers needed at all,

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.800
as long as just the track two was a complete track two.

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.640
So it's a valid track two that doesn't,

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.560
so the pin is the thing that gets you in?

01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.200
So back then, all right, back then,

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:52.120
what we're talking about is you needed,

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.320
typically, today, you need a whole track two.

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:56.040
You need that valid track two, all right?

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:59.760
You need the 16-digit card number, forward slash,

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:02.360
and then whatever that algorithm is on the side of it,

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:03.200
all right?

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.840
Back then, none of the banks

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.760
had implemented that algorithm.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.920
So while the algorithm was there,

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.360
you didn't need it to encode.

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:14.480
Interesting.

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.920
Interesting.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.040
So you can make a lot of money with physical,

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.000
of fake credit cards, debit cards.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.520
Card not present fraud, remember I told you,

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:28.320
was $30,000 to $40,000 a month, all right?

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:32.560
That turned into $30,000 to $40,000 a day.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.680
The Ukrainians, again, they can't cash it out.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:38.240
They've got all the data on the planet,

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.240
but they can't cash it out,

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.400
those three necessities of cybercrime.

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:44.600
So the deal became, you have to rely on the Americans.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.600
Tell you what, we'll give you 40%.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.080
So you had all these cashiers

01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:51.160
that were 40% of $40,000 a day.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.360
Yeah, we'll take that, all right?

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.560
Send the rest of it over to buy Western Union

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.880
or what have you to your Ukrainian contact.

01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.720
That's before cryptocurrency came into play.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:01.760
Now you had a couple of forerunners with eGold

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.320
and Liberty Reserve, things like that.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.680
But back then, it starts out with Western Union,

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.400
then it becomes prepaid cards,

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.120
sending track information over,

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.440
loading the card up like that,

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.480
and then finally you get to eGold, Liberty Reserve,

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.840
and then today it's with crypto, that's used.

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.680
Started stealing a lot of money, a lot,

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:26.920
and that got law enforcement attention.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.800
So we started to see, I mean, it's a crazy ass story.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:34.000
We started to see IPs coming in

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.040
from law enforcement agencies, government agencies,

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.200
because back then they didn't know

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.640
how to shield their identity either.

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.400
So you saw Secret Service, you saw DOD,

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:45.440
all these like, and you're like, that's interesting.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.280
So, you know, and at the same time,

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.120
we had, it was called a hack, but it wasn't a hack.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:58.840
We had a guy that worked at T-Mobile in Los Angeles.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.800
This is the same guy that back then published

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:04.960
Paris Hilton's phone contact list.

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.160
That made a lot of news.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.800
Not only did he do that, but it turned out

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.400
that the Los Angeles Secret Service Agency

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.200
was using T-Mobile phones.

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.880
So he's getting text messages

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:19.960
of the Secret Service investigating Shadow Crew.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.800
And he posts those damn things on Shadow Crew.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.880
So I'm sitting there going, head of the pile.

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:27.040
I'm sitting there going, this is not gonna end well.

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:28.560
This is not gonna end well.

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.360
So at the same time, I had access,

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.040
I started out with access

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:35.680
to the Indiana State Sex Offenders Registry,

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.840
and I was using that to create bank accounts,

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.680
I slaughtered money out and I would sell the bank accounts,

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:40.520
stuff like that.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.120
They shut that down.

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:44.920
The next database I had access to

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:47.600
was the Texas Driver's License Database,

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:50.000
and started using that to create

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.080
fake driver's licenses, what have you.

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:54.400
And then finally, we happened upon

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.800
the California Death Index, all right?

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.760
Complete information, mother's maiden,

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:04.640
socials, DOBs, all that, and it's like,

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.240
gotta be a use for that.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:09.640
Well, you can use it to create identities all day long.

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:14.640
My idea was, I wonder if you could take somebody

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:18.440
that's died and then file for social security death benefit,

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.320
not death benefits, but social security benefits

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.200
for that individual, and get that recurring paycheck in.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.680
So that takes a lot of research

01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:26.760
to start seeing if you can do that.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.440
How does the federal government know if you're dead?

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.680
Do federal indexes reference state indexes?

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.920
You got all these questions that pop up.

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.800
Well, it turns out, federal indexes

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.280
don't reference state indexes, it's against the law.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.560
So it also turns out, the only way

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.680
the federal government knows you're dead

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.520
is prior to 1998, the family had to file

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:53.520
a social security death benefit for that person, all right?

01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.080
Prior to 98, of course most people don't.

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.600
Right, prior to 98, it took the family.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.240
After 98, the hospital can do it,

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.560
funeral home can do it, or the family can do it.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.840
So a lot more people have it filed after,

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:06.680
if they've died.

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.560
But it's still, there's a lot of people probably

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:09.840
that don't. A lot of people don't.

01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:13.240
Because that death benefit's only like $219.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.960
Yeah. Okay, nobody's thinking about that shit.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.840
So I started to apply for social security benefits.

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.760
Nope, numbers dormant.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:23.760
So they want you to come in for a physical interview.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.480
Here I am, you know, 32.

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.600
You're not gonna pass as a 65-year-old, so no.

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.560
So the next idea I had was,

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.800
I wonder if you could file income tax returns

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.640
on these people.

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:40.400
Turns out you can, all day long.

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.120
So I started doing that.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.080
And I started to steal, once I got ramped up,

01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:46.240
because you test everything.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.680
You know, you're testing to make sure,

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.360
you gotta figure out what the deposit instrument is

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:51.200
and everything else.

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:53.200
And once you get all that lined out,

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.920
I started to steal $160,000 a week,

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.480
every week for 10 months out of the year.

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.720
By paying taxes?

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.000
By filing fake-

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.080
Yeah, filing fake tax returns.

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:08.360
So you find a business, and the way the system worked is,

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.720
the IRS will issue a refund on somebody

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:13.080
before they're able to verify

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:15.360
that that person worked for an employer.

01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.440
Still works like that today.

01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:18.280
All right.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:19.120
So-

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.560
And you're keeping the amounts relatively low-

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.640
Keep them at $3,000.

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.480
All right.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.320
Amounts are very low-

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:25.720
But you're still able to achieve scale

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.240
because this large index of real-

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.960
I got to where, and I was manual.

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.320
Later on, a couple of buddies of mine

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:31.520
went automated with it.

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:32.360
Wait, you were going,

01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.800
doing this by hand, so there's no code involved?

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:35.720
All manual.

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:36.560
Wow.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.280
I'd file a return once every six minutes,

01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:42.160
work 10 hours a day, three days a week.

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:44.720
So clicking on, so typing fast and clicking-

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:46.560
One return every six minutes.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.320
That's changing IP, that's changing address,

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:51.680
everything else, one return every six minutes,

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.080
for three days a week.

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.080
Fourth day I would take a road trip,

01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.280
plot out a map of ATMs,

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.520
and then the next two days, cash out.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.920
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:03.760
All right.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.200
Come back home, rinse and repeat.

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.080
Turns out that a backpack,

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.360
I don't see anyone sitting around here,

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.960
but a backpack will hold $150,000 of 20s,

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.400
is what it'll hold.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.680
So I'd put 150k and 20s in a backpack,

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:18.240
I had a spare bedroom.

01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.040
I'd come in, toss the backpack in the bedroom.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.080
This is very, very important information,

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.360
and the fact that you know it is also very-

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.920
First we started with a volume of coal that weighs a ton,

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.280
and now a backpack holds $150,000 of 20s,

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.320
and then you can multiply that by five for hundreds.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.240
Yeah.

01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:37.080
I like this.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.680
Most of the time it's 20s coming out of an ATM, right?

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:42.000
Each 20 weighs a gram.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.880
Each 20 weighs a gram.

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:45.480
So you can actually go by weight,

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.320
which is what federal authorities do

01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:49.920
when they get a pallet of cash, they just weigh it.

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.200
Oh, they just weigh it.

01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:55.680
So 150k is seven and a half keys of cash.

01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:59.440
One and a half feet, 15, oh, that's pretty light.

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.280
Not bad, not bad.

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.080
Yeah, so you get a big backpack,

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:05.120
you do a good run with David Goggins with it.

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:05.960
I like it.

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.560
The fact that you know this is great.

01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:11.320
So wait, where does that come in with the backpack?

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:14.040
So what happens is, I didn't know how to launder money.

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.280
All right, so I'm throwing cash in the spare bedroom.

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.320
One day you open up the bedroom, and you're like,

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.120
gotta do something with those backpacks.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.880
And that's when you start learning how to launder money.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.680
Cash-based businesses, things like that.

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:28.760
I had a production company,

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:30.360
had a couple detailing company.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.640
I was thinking about going into food trucks,

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:33.960
things like that in Charleston, South Carolina.

01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.160
Actually, can you pause on that to take a tangent there?

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.920
How does money laundering work?

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.600
I mean, at that time,

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.960
in what years are we talking about?

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:47.680
This is, by the time the tax return schemes go into play,

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.840
we're talking 2002, 2003 is when tax returns start.

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.880
At that time, and what you're aware of now,

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.280
how it evolved, how does money laundering work?

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.600
You know, it's not that much different.

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.160
It's really not.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:04.120
You get a cash-based business,

01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:06.120
start laundering the money or putting the money through that,

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:08.040
saying the transactions are legal.

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.120
You then start depositing it into bank accounts.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.560
From bank accounts, my thing was is,

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:19.880
have bank accounts in the United States, Mexico, Canada,

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.400
and then finally bounce over to Estonia,

01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.040
was the final destination of all this stuff.

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:28.480
And the idea is, is to try to move them to so many places

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.200
that by the end of the day, it looks legal

01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:34.480
and you can't trace it all if you're ever caught,

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.280
which you ultimately are.

01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:38.640
But so cash-based businesses, you know-

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.040
When you say, sorry to interrupt,

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.800
the cash-based businesses,

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.800
so you have money that needs to be moved to other people.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:49.600
So how does that work?

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:50.840
What's the business?

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:52.640
Are people providing your service

01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.320
and you're giving them money?

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:57.440
Right, so you do the Ozark thing if you want to do that,

01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:59.600
so you can gamble, cash out something like that,

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:02.520
so there are trips to whatever casinos you've got.

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:05.840
You've got your production company or your detail company.

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.040
So how many cars are you cleaning in a day?

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:10.240
How many companies have you got to do that?

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.640
All right, whatever that company is,

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.720
it's gotta be cash-based.

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.920
Somebody's paying you in cash is what you're doing.

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:19.000
You have to have enough of those cash-based businesses

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.120
where it doesn't look funny.

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:23.120
All right, because if you're a detail company

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.120
making $100,000 a month, that's a problem.

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.440
Yeah.

01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:30.320
Okay, so then you start depositing into that.

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.200
Well, because of the Patriot Act,

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:35.000
as suspicious activity reports,

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.000
SARS came in at $2,500 instead of the 10K that it used to be.

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:42.240
So all of a sudden, you've got multiple bank accounts

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:44.680
that you've got to set up, all right?

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.280
Fortunately, what you also had

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:47.960
is you had a bunch of prepaid debit cards

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.880
that were coming into play at the same time.

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.000
So a combination of bank accounts,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.320
prepaid debits that had ACH abilities

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.520
to attach to those as well,

01:45:56.520 --> 01:45:58.400
and you start running them all together.

01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:00.280
Then once it's out of the United States,

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:01.360
you don't have to worry as much.

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.360
You can start funneling that into fewer bank accounts

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.680
until finally you've got the one main account

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:11.280
that's over at Banquetico in Estonia at that point.

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:13.000
That's what you've got.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.400
So a bunch of hops that end up at a place

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400
that you can't trace.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:19.840
To give you an idea, I was arrested February 8th, 2005.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.880
My last seizure was 2010.

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.280
Got the last seizure notice.

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:26.160
So took them that day.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.280
They got it, but it took them that long to get to it.

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:34.400
So how do stories like with Scrip that come into play here

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.640
where he had someone who owed him money

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.080
kidnapped and tortured.

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:45.080
So when does it turn darker?

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.760
It turns darker when the more money you make.

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.800
Scrip was a kid that he was stealing enough money

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.080
that he was able to buy whatever state he wanted to.

01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.960
And he would brag about touring the countryside,

01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:00.920
and if he saw property that he liked, he would buy it.

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:03.800
And that was not just a brag, he was doing that.

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:05.720
So this kid is stealing a lot of money.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:08.560
At the same time, he's got connections politically

01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:09.800
because of his family.

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:12.040
He's got connections, and that family's got connections

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.480
with a Ukrainian mob.

01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:17.720
So he's got these inroads, and people are looking out for him,

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:20.000
and he's stealing a lot of money at the same time.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.320
Somebody doesn't pay him a decent amount of money.

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.360
Somebody doesn't pay him.

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:29.360
Now we had never, with Shadow Crew, with Carter Planet,

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:33.680
with Counterfeit Library, we were basically the geeks.

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.840
We were just the fraudsters, the social engineers.

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:38.840
We had never really considered violence.

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:40.520
The rules that I had in play were,

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:43.120
hey, we don't do child pornography.

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.240
We don't do counterfeit currency.

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:46.760
We don't do drugs.

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.800
And the only thing we ended up really obeying

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:51.560
was the child porn stuff, except for Max Butler,

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.440
who you mentioned earlier.

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:57.160
Script, someone rips the guy off.

01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:02.200
And he comes online on Shadow Crew at that point,

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:04.240
and he posts these pictures one day.

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:07.200
And I mean, it was a detailed narrative through the pictures.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.280
Had the guy that rammed in the van,

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.640
he had the door open and rammed in the van,

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:15.720
had the guy tied up, had the guy being tortured.

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.200
And the response was, this is what

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:22.440
happens when you steal from me.

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.560
And that's the first time that violence

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.360
came into play at that point.

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:30.960
That's when you start realizing things

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:32.520
are getting a little serious.

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.600
How did that make you feel?

01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:38.000
The first response is, can't be real.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.400
He's just doing that.

01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.120
He's wanting to send a message.

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.600
Then you're like, no, that's real.

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.920
That's real.

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:51.960
Were you afraid in your own heart

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.320
that you might descend to that too?

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.440
If you see that, or was it pretty clear to you

01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:03.120
that that's a line that some people can cross and some can't,

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:05.240
and you're not one of those that can cross it?

01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:07.200
I got to tell you, I joke with my wife.

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:11.880
The joke I tell my wife is, if I knew some guy that

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:15.000
had 8,000 bitcoins, I might be persuaded

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.480
to ask him for access to that.

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480
And she was like, how?

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:21.040
And I was like, well, hammering toes.

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:21.560
Yeah.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:26.880
And I say that as a joke, but there's

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:32.120
that line where you're like, I remember who I used to be.

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:35.400
And if you're looking at that kind of money,

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.600
if you're looking at that kind of money,

01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:40.800
I might be persuaded to do that back then.

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:46.920
And I think that was Scripps' issue,

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.800
is it was a lot of money to him.

01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:53.080
And then there's violence can also be gradual.

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.440
So over time, you do a little more, a little more,

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:57.240
a little more, a little more.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:59.760
You get used to what's going on, and then I get desensitized.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.160
And you figure, you take somebody

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:05.880
like Ross Ulbrich, the Silk Road guy.

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:08.360
Ross was not a violent guy.

01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:08.960
He was not.

01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.280
But at that point in time, he was sitting on $24 million

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.160
of bitcoin.

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:15.160
He was the only game in town.

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:20.440
And that $24 now is like $24 billion, some crap like that.

01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:24.560
But he felt in danger.

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:28.840
This guy was going to turn him in.

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:30.340
It was a blackmail to him, everything.

01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:34.900
Ross thinks he hires a couple hit men to kill the guy.

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:36.740
So it becomes that thing.

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.660
And I saw that over and over again.

01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:41.340
And I'd like to say I wasn't like that.

01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:44.020
But given the same circumstances,

01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:46.380
I would have probably done the same thing.

01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:49.140
And also, when you're not just about money,

01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:53.420
there's a lot of other forces, like if you're threatened

01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:56.300
for your well-being, or for your wealth, or for your power.

01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:59.380
All of us operate under different motivations.

01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:02.620
Plus, that online aspect with those communities like that,

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:04.500
if you're the head guy, you really

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.380
feel like you're the parent of these guys.

01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:08.740
So if somebody's starting to threaten them, it's like, all

01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:10.460
right, what do I need to do?

01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:12.060
So what do you make of Silk Road?

01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:16.580
The Shadow Crews started something that today you

01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:20.900
can call darknet markets, so these markets

01:51:20.900 --> 01:51:23.620
that operate that trade.

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:27.100
Trade things, everything from child pornography,

01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:32.260
to drugs, to what else?

01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:34.060
What are the dark things that humans

01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:36.300
want to do that they don't want anyone to know

01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:39.940
about, all of those things?

01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:44.020
So can you maybe tell me, you know what?

01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:45.180
Let's just even step back.

01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:46.220
What is the darknet?

01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.860
How big is it?

01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:49.540
What happens there?

01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:53.060
Let's backtrack a little bit more before we get to that.

01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:58.820
What Shadow Crew did, other than dealing

01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:03.300
in all these stolen wares, what Shadow Crew did,

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.980
that's really important.

01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:07.980
Remember those three necessities that I talked about?

01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:11.180
But the important thing is it established trust

01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:14.340
among criminals, because that's a necessity.

01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:17.420
You have to be able to trust who you're dealing with,

01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:19.340
because you have to deal with somebody.

01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:21.260
You have to.

01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:23.500
So how do you know you're not dealing with a cop?

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:25.500
How do you know you're dealing with somebody that's skilled?

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:26.740
How do you know you're going to deal with somebody that's

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:27.940
not going to rip you off?

01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:30.100
You have to be able to trust that individual.

01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:32.980
Shadow Crew provided that trust mechanism for criminals.

01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.820
You had that communication channel, the forums,

01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:38.540
where you could reference conversations weeks, months

01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:41.340
old, take part, learn from those conversations.

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:44.020
You had vouching systems and review systems in place,

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.660
escrow systems in place.

01:52:46.660 --> 01:52:49.700
You knew by looking at someone's screen name,

01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:51.500
if you could trust the individual,

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:53.300
network with the individual.

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.500
And that community of just humans

01:52:57.500 --> 01:53:01.220
provided that backbone of trust.

01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:04.020
And that's really interesting when you think about it.

01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:05.460
You had the trust that was there,

01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:11.300
but you also had almost this instantaneous information

01:53:11.300 --> 01:53:13.580
that was available about the community,

01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:15.380
or about cybercrime at large.

01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:18.020
And that's still in play today.

01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:22.500
So that was the way things were until a couple of things

01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:23.100
happened.

01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.580
And one was cryptocurrency.

01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:28.900
The other one was the Tor browser, the dark web.

01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:30.900
Now, I was working with the Secret Service,

01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:34.820
ripping the Secret Service off, when Tor comes into play.

01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:37.340
So we got a memo in one day, and it

01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:38.860
was talking about the Tor browser.

01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:41.820
And it was like, we really need to be careful with this.

01:53:41.820 --> 01:53:43.260
This is going to be a problem.

01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:45.660
And so we all fired up the Tor browser.

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:50.500
And it turns out this was 2005, early six.

01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:52.180
Turns out it was completely unusable.

01:53:52.180 --> 01:53:55.100
Could not use it at all, simply because no one was using it.

01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:56.900
And it was extremely slow.

01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:59.020
So for people who don't know, Tor browser

01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:01.460
is a way to be completely anonymous.

01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.540
As long as you properly know how to use it.

01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:05.220
Huge caveat.

01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:07.860
So developed by the United States Navy.

01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:10.060
And they developed it.

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:10.620
Oh, yeah.

01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:13.260
It wasn't the hackers that.

01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:17.300
The US Navy, to this day, the number one funder of Tor

01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.940
military, to this day.

01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:20.460
All right.

01:54:20.460 --> 01:54:21.020
Interesting.

01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:22.940
I mean, the same, I guess, with the internet.

01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:24.860
The origins are dark.

01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:27.700
And it was developed so that operatives

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:30.420
could communicate with each other without being identified.

01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:31.380
All right.

01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:33.180
That then goes open source.

01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:34.340
They release it.

01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:38.380
EFF comes in, starts sponsoring, and everything else like that.

01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:40.540
The next idea was, well, people can

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.540
get around their country's firewalls.

01:54:42.540 --> 01:54:43.500
Whistleblowers can use it.

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:44.220
Things like that.

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:48.020
Well, someone forgot to mention that the first adoptees of tech,

01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:50.940
if you can use it to launder money or remain anonymous,

01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:52.940
are criminals.

01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:55.340
So criminals start to use the damn thing.

01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:56.660
All right.

01:54:56.660 --> 01:55:00.020
So along the same time, we get, well, a few years later,

01:55:00.020 --> 01:55:05.260
we get Satoshi Nakamoto pops up with his ideas for Bitcoin.

01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:07.660
And then Ross Ulbricht runs with it.

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:10.140
Ross Ulbricht decides he's going to start up Silk Road.

01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:13.620
So initially, the people who were using Tor, which later

01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:16.500
is the dark web, people were using Tor

01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:20.100
were just talking with each other, visiting websites,

01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:21.580
communicating like that.

01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:25.900
Someone figured out, hey, man, we can host websites on this thing.

01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:28.980
And they have a lot of trouble finding the box.

01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:33.700
So that is the advent of Silk Road all of a sudden.

01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:35.380
Ross Ulbricht has this idea that he's

01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:39.100
going to change the world by becoming the largest drug

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:40.940
dealer on the planet.

01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:42.580
So he opens up the Silk Road.

01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:46.540
And the only payment instrument he allows is Bitcoin.

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:48.620
So if those people out there are wondering

01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:51.820
why Bitcoin is going at, what, 44k today?

01:55:51.820 --> 01:55:52.980
Yeah.

01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:56.180
By the time this is out, it could be 100,000 or 10,000.

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:56.660
Absolutely.

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:57.180
We'll see.

01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:59.420
Who knows?

01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:01.340
If it's 10,000, I'm going to buy some.

01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:06.020
Which is a hilarious statement to make,

01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:09.220
because that statement would be ridiculously wrong,

01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.500
like, five years ago, right?

01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.700
I know, I know, I know.

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:14.900
People 100 years from now will be laughing, wait,

01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:18.460
it was that low back then?

01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:20.060
So he only accepts Bitcoin.

01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:24.340
And that's, of course, the initial use case of crypto is,

01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:26.500
no one wants to admit it today.

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.580
But the initial use case is, we're

01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:30.780
going to buy a bunch of pot.

01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:33.500
We need somebody, we need a way to pay for it.

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:35.380
So that's what happens.

01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:38.580
Ross, it's really interesting to me.

01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:43.140
If you look at motivations of cyber criminals,

01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:47.940
the motivations are status, cash, ideology.

01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.900
My guys, all cash.

01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:52.220
Across the board, all cash.

01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:54.620
Ross's ideology.

01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:57.060
He really believed he was going to change the world.

01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:57.700
He really didn't.

01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:02.780
I've been fortunate, I actually know the guy who ran Silk Road

01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:06.980
too, and have talked to the kid, everything else.

01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:10.940
And I will tell you that those guys who

01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:15.060
are motivated by ideology, they are a completely different

01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:16.020
breed.

01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:17.060
They really are.

01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:21.620
It's not, you know, the cash guy, it's low-hanging fruit.

01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:26.300
The ease of, it's hard to stop committing crime.

01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:29.340
But it's much easier for a cash-motivated individual

01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:32.500
to stop than it is that ideology guy.

01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:35.060
That Silk Road too guy, he's still got it.

01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:36.500
You know, he's not breaking the law.

01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:41.340
But you can see, it's like, he wants to, he wants to.

01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:43.940
So it's.

01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:46.900
That's fascinating that, I mean, the worst atrocities

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:49.380
in human history are committed with people

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:51.180
that operate under ideology.

01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:53.140
All the other motivations are much weaker.

01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:56.740
But you know, you think about it, with Ross, I mean,

01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:58.260
very bright guy.

01:57:58.300 --> 01:57:59.700
Very bright guy.

01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:02.340
But think about the amount of cognitive dissonance

01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:04.220
that the guy's got.

01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:06.700
That he thinks he's going to change the world

01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:08.260
by running a drug site.

01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:12.740
I mean, certainly, I mean, could he have changed the world?

01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:13.580
Yeah.

01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:15.020
Could he have done it like that?

01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:17.340
Probably not.

01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:19.300
Well, I can, I can still amend those arguments.

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:22.340
I say, I listened to quite a few libertarians

01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:26.220
and you could push that to anarchists and you know,

01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:27.860
there's a lot of people that argue.

01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:32.820
So I actually talked to a professor at Columbia

01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:35.180
who actually argues that all drugs should be legalized

01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:37.460
and not at a philosophical level, political level,

01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:40.940
but the fact that all the negative consequences

01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:44.660
of drugs that people talk about actually have to do

01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:47.220
with other factors in your life.

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:48.300
I would agree with that.

01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:51.620
And so that's, okay, but that's more like a argument

01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:53.660
about negative aspects of drugs.

01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:56.420
I think the ideology comes in where it's like,

01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:59.300
well, nobody should tell you what to do.

01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:01.980
You should be, you should have the responsibility

01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:02.980
of your own actions.

01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:07.820
Like the government or any other institution

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:12.340
shouldn't be the rule setters,

01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:14.580
the constraints for how you live your life.

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.140
And so that I could see that argument being made.

01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:22.140
And ultimately, if you like create an open market for drugs,

01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:24.620
how that could build a better society,

01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:27.180
it might break down the outdated,

01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:29.620
the corrupt, the bureaucratic institutions.

01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:31.860
I mean, you can make that argument.

01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:32.700
There's an argument.

01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:33.620
And let's be fair.

01:59:33.620 --> 01:59:34.580
I wanna be fair with it.

01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:38.180
I mean, did he change the world?

01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:40.500
We do have this whole thing called cryptocurrency.

01:59:40.500 --> 01:59:43.060
Yeah, in the long arc of history, perhaps.

01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:44.740
Yeah, we do have that.

01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:46.900
That's a biggie.

01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:50.740
And that might have been for it to take hold in society,

01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:52.980
maybe the darker parts of society at first,

01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:54.180
maybe that was necessary.

01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:55.020
Right.

01:59:55.020 --> 01:59:57.340
I mean, maybe, we'll see how it pans out.

01:59:57.340 --> 02:00:02.340
Shadow Crew, we had this guy, Albert Gonzalez,

02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:06.780
his kid's name, we were growing so big

02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:11.260
that I had to start farming things out.

02:00:11.260 --> 02:00:12.700
So the first thing I started farming,

02:00:12.700 --> 02:00:14.820
I instituted this review system,

02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:18.340
kind of establishing that trust mechanism

02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:19.980
even further for criminals to use.

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:24.180
We needed somebody to take care of our

02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:25.820
tech aspects of the forum.

02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:29.500
So an associate of mine by the name of Kim Taylor,

02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:31.300
we were looking for a forum techie.

02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:32.980
He comes to me one night and he's like,

02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:34.140
found our forum techie.

02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:35.140
I was like, who's that?

02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:36.860
And he's like, it's this kid.

02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:38.340
And I was like, is he any good?

02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:39.460
He's like, well, he knows the software.

02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:41.180
And I was like, okay.

02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:43.060
We just signed his ass on.

02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:45.540
He went by the screen name of Cumbo Johnny,

02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:46.740
was his screen name.

02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:49.740
And he starts selling credit cards after a while

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:51.620
under a screen name of Scarface.

02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:56.620
And that CVB1 breach where you're cashing out

02:00:57.140 --> 02:01:02.020
the track twos at ATMs, you know, $40,000 a day.

02:01:02.020 --> 02:01:06.860
So Albert's in New Jersey one day, broad daylight,

02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:11.860
and stands at an ATM for 40 minutes, just standing there,

02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:14.900
feeding in one ATM card after another,

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:17.580
pulling out cash, taking the 20s out,

02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:19.620
stuff them in that backpack.

02:01:19.620 --> 02:01:21.300
Meanwhile, just across the street,

02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:23.900
a couple of cops just happened to be there.

02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:28.340
And they start noticing this kid just standing there.

02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:31.620
So 40 minutes, they watch this kid, 40 minutes.

02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:33.580
Finally, one cop looks at the other,

02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:35.300
let me see what's going on there.

02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:39.260
Walks over across the street, Albert's wearing a wig.

02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:42.020
He's got the disguise on, everything else like that.

02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:43.940
Ask him, kid, what are you doing?

02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:45.260
Albert falls apart.

02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:48.540
We didn't know Albert had been arrested.

02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:50.940
So Albert immediately goes in,

02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:52.820
I wanna work with the Secret Service.

02:01:54.780 --> 02:01:56.900
At that point in time, Secret Service,

02:01:59.340 --> 02:02:02.940
I referred to, and I wanna make sure I don't say,

02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:04.460
it's not like that anymore.

02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:07.700
But back then, they were fucking idiots, all right?

02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:09.260
They had no clue what was going on.

02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:10.740
So there was a competence issue

02:02:10.740 --> 02:02:12.500
that they were working through, is one way to put it.

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.940
That's a nice euphemism.

02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:18.940
Or fucking idiots is another way to say it.

02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:21.740
So they're just not aware of the digital world.

02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:23.020
They had no clue, no clue.

02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:26.100
The way that Albert tells them how to catch us,

02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:28.580
because they looked at him, how do we catch him?

02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:32.380
And Albert's like, I'm serious, I'm serious.

02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:35.660
So Albert's like, well, you could try a VPN.

02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:37.420
What's a VPN?

02:02:37.420 --> 02:02:39.780
So he explains it to them, they're like,

02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:41.740
that's a good idea.

02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:43.860
So I quit Shadow Crew.

02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:45.620
I was worried about all the news that was coming in,

02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:46.460
everything like that.

02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:47.860
I'm still in 160K a week.

02:02:47.860 --> 02:02:49.820
I didn't know Albert had been arrested.

02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:52.540
I'm worried about being arrested.

02:02:52.540 --> 02:02:54.500
I know the writing's on the wall.

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:56.660
And I'm like, I'm quitting.

02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:58.660
Where did you see the writing?

02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:00.420
The IPs that were coming in,

02:03:00.420 --> 02:03:03.260
the text messages about the Secret Service investigators,

02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:04.100
I referred to.

02:03:04.100 --> 02:03:05.620
So the pressure's building, it's not gonna end well.

02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:07.620
Man, this is not gonna end well.

02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:09.100
This is gonna be bad.

02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:13.580
So I announced my retirement of February 15th.

02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:18.140
I'm sorry, April 15th, 2004 is my retirement.

02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:19.820
I think that's 2004.

02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:22.660
And I quit, I walk away.

02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:24.900
Well, Albert had been arrested.

02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:26.140
They cut him loose.

02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:27.260
No one knows he's been arrested.

02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:29.020
He comes back into Shadow Crew.

02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:31.660
I leave Kim Taylor at the same time.

02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:32.820
He's kind of on the run,

02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:34.460
which if you wanna know that story,

02:03:34.460 --> 02:03:36.820
that's a nightmare story in and of itself.

02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:40.300
So my second in charge, Kim Taylor, this guy,

02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:42.380
there was this guy named David,

02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:45.180
oh, what was his name?

02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:49.060
He was, El Mariachi was the guy's name.

02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:50.300
David Thomas.

02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:53.420
David, yeah, yeah, he was a film guy, so.

02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:54.260
Scarface.

02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:55.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:58.380
So El Mariachi, real name David Thomas,

02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:02.340
he's on the run out of Nebraska for check fraud.

02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:06.300
He comes to us on Shadow Crew telling us this sad story.

02:04:06.300 --> 02:04:08.980
We take up a collection for this guy,

02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:10.580
send it to him, all right?

02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:13.780
I get him a job working with a low-level carter

02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:16.620
trying to make him some money, all right?

02:04:16.620 --> 02:04:19.300
El Mariachi does, or Thomas does this for a few weeks,

02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:20.500
comes to me one day and he's like,

02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:22.060
man, I'm not making any money.

02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:23.380
I'm like, okay, let me see what I can do.

02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:27.100
Well, I had a Ukrainian guy by the name of Big Buyer.

02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:30.300
He, a real friend of mine, and I contacted him.

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:32.100
I was like, look, man, I got a guy that wants to do some work.

02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:32.940
Can you help the guy out?

02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:33.940
And he's like, I got it.

02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:35.100
I was like, okay.

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:38.460
So he sends Thomas enough money to go,

02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.260
Thomas is in Texas at that point,

02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:43.300
sends Thomas enough money to go from Texas

02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:47.580
to Issaquah, Washington and rent an office space, all right?

02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:50.980
So Thomas goes up there, rents his office space,

02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:54.340
him and his girlfriend, rents an office space.

02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:59.340
And the plan is, is Big Buyer is going to place an order,

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:03.260
get product sent, Mariachi is going to get the product

02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:07.060
listed on eBay, cash out 50-50, easy enough, all right?

02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:09.020
So Big Buyer places an order.

02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:11.940
First order is outpost.com, $18,000.

02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:16.300
The largest order outpost.com had ever received

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:17.380
at that point in time.

02:05:18.420 --> 02:05:19.740
Order goes through.

02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:20.580
It goes through still.

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:23.580
It goes through, he gets the product, all right?

02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:25.140
Mariachi comes back, tells me,

02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:27.060
tells my second in charge, Kim Taylor.

02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:31.060
Kim Taylor at this point, I'm 33, 34.

02:05:31.060 --> 02:05:32.500
Kim Taylor is 46.

02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:36.380
He works at the Tattered Cover Bookstore in Denver, Colorado.

02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:37.820
That's where he works at this point.

02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:40.900
And he fancies himself Jason Bourne, all right?

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:43.660
He's even got one of the screen names of Jason Bourne.

02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:46.780
So I'm like, all right, so Mariachi is telling us

02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:48.260
how much money he's making and everything else.

02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:50.300
I'm like, well, that's good, I'm glad you're all right.

02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:53.380
Kim contacts me, he's like, I wanna go to Issaquah.

02:05:53.380 --> 02:05:54.500
And I was like, why?

02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:55.460
And he's like, to make some money.

02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:57.100
I'm like, you're making money.

02:05:57.100 --> 02:05:58.620
He's like, I wanna go to Issaquah.

02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:00.780
I was like, all right, go, be careful.

02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:02.980
So he gets in the car.

02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:04.540
Saturn is what he's driving.

02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:06.860
He drives his little piece of Saturn

02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:08.460
all the way up to Issaquah.

02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:10.660
Gets there, you know, midnight.

02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:12.500
They party all night long

02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:14.260
because they've never met each other.

02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:15.300
They're just celebrating,

02:06:15.300 --> 02:06:17.740
partying, drinking, everything else like that.

02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:22.260
Meanwhile, Big Buyer has placed another order

02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:27.180
with Outpost.com, $17,000.

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:31.300
The second largest order, Outpost.com had ever received

02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:33.460
at that point in time.

02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:34.500
By this point in time,

02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:37.060
Outpost knows the first order was fraudulent.

02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:38.180
Guess where it's going?

02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:41.220
The exact same address the first order goes.

02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:44.180
So Outpost picks up the phone, calls Issaquah PD.

02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:46.540
Hey, we got a fraudster.

02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:51.300
Issaquah's like, would you mind sending some empty boxes?

02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:54.460
And Outpost is like, be happy to.

02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:58.300
So the rule was, is on credit card fraud,

02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:01.940
if you've got full account access, you place the order.

02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:03.700
The morning it's supposed to arrive,

02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:06.260
you sign into the bank account or the credit card account.

02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:09.220
If you can sign in, you go pick up your product.

02:07:09.220 --> 02:07:12.500
If you can't sign in, you go back to sleep that day.

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:13.780
All right?

02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:16.380
Well, Big Buyer was the guy who placed the order.

02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:19.980
Mariachi and my second in charge are partying.

02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:20.820
All right?

02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:23.020
So they're supposed to contact Big Buyer.

02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:24.340
They don't.

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:26.940
Meanwhile, Big Buyer is raising hell,

02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:31.220
getting up with me like, hey, where are the guys?

02:07:31.220 --> 02:07:32.340
I can't find them.

02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:34.460
They don't need to pick up this product.

02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:36.340
So I can't get in touch with them.

02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:37.460
They go down to pick up the thing.

02:07:37.460 --> 02:07:41.500
So Mariachi's got a Cadillac, old 70s Cadillac.

02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:45.620
He's got a Cadillac, pulls into the complex.

02:07:45.620 --> 02:07:50.620
Now Mariachi's driving, Kim Taylor's in the passenger seat,

02:07:51.660 --> 02:07:54.220
David Thomas's girlfriend's in the back seat.

02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:55.900
As they pull into the complex,

02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:57.620
going through the parking lot,

02:07:57.620 --> 02:08:00.660
Mariachi just happens to glance over and he sees a van

02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:03.020
with a guy sitting sideways in the van.

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.700
And he looks at Kim Taylor and he's like,

02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:07.900
that's an undercover.

02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:10.540
And Kim's like, ah, it's fine.

02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:13.620
So they pull up to the office complex.

02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:16.780
Kim's like, I'll go in and get the packages.

02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:19.660
So he walks in, looks at the guy behind the counter.

02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:21.300
I believe you have some packages for us.

02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:23.460
Guy's like, one second.

02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:26.180
So he disappears around the wall,

02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:29.820
out pops the Issaquah PD, arrest Kim.

02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:32.500
David Thomas is in the car watching all this happen.

02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:37.020
He bugs out and they arrest him on the interstate

02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:40.260
where he has three fake driver's licenses in his wallet

02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:43.220
along with his real driver's license, another no-no,

02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:44.220
but they get him.

02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:48.180
So David Thomas had outstanding warrants out of Nebraska.

02:08:48.180 --> 02:08:50.180
We couldn't bond him out.

02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:53.860
Kim Taylor didn't have any warrants, so we bonded him out.

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:59.940
My third in-charge kid, Seth Sanders was his name,

02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:02.580
he bonds him out, uses his girlfriend's account

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:03.460
to bond him out.

02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:08.460
And I get Kim Taylor to go to Utah

02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:13.460
where another friend of mine agrees to house him,

02:09:13.460 --> 02:09:15.140
him and his wife.

02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:17.340
So I think everything's fine and all that.

02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:21.340
About three weeks later, this guy in Utah

02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:22.180
gets me on the phone.

02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:24.260
Hey, he's gotta go.

02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:27.460
I'm like, what's going on?

02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:30.500
He's like, well, the only thing he's doing

02:09:30.500 --> 02:09:33.780
is popping ecstasy tablets every day, all day.

02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:35.100
And I'm like, seriously?

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:35.940
He's like, yeah.

02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:37.060
I was like, okay, he's gotta go.

02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:38.780
So we kick him out of there.

02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:40.540
By this point, I've got another crew that's coming through.

02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.340
I mean, I had all these crews running,

02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:45.300
had another crew that's coming through Denver,

02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:48.980
send Kim back to Denver to partner up with these guys.

02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:51.900
Kim gets these guys arrested.

02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:54.620
So by this point in time, I'm exasperated.

02:09:54.620 --> 02:09:57.780
I just wanna throw my hands up in the air and walk away.

02:09:57.780 --> 02:10:00.580
So my retirement's coming up at the same time.

02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:03.540
So I'm like, fuck it, I'm done.

02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:05.980
So I tell everybody at the rest of the admins

02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:07.860
and the mods there, I'm like, this is what's going on.

02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:09.300
You guys need to watch out for this.

02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:11.820
We need to ban Kim, not let him back in.

02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:13.260
Be careful what's going on.

02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:15.060
I walk away.

02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:17.700
At the same time I walk away,

02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:20.900
Cumber Johnny, Albert Gonzalez comes back into play.

02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:22.540
He sees everything that's going on.

02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:24.100
He uses that to his advantage.

02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:26.860
He starts banning everyone that's suspicious of him,

02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:29.260
sets up the VPN at the same time and says,

02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:31.540
hey, to make sure we're all secure,

02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:34.860
I need all transactions to go through this VPN.

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:37.580
VPNs ran by the Secret Service.

02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:39.300
All right, Secret Service ends up,

02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:40.540
I think they ended up cataloging

02:10:40.540 --> 02:10:42.500
like $7 million worth of transactions

02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:45.180
over the next four or five months.

02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:48.340
Shadow Crew makes the front cover of Forbes,

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:51.740
August 2004, headline, Who's Stealing Your Identity?

02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:56.140
October 26th, 2004, United States Secret Service

02:10:56.140 --> 02:11:00.380
arrest 33 people, six countries, six hours.

02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:02.860
I was in Charleston, South Carolina when I saw it happen

02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:06.220
and I'm like, you know what I'm saying?

02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:08.460
You're the one that got away.

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.260
I'm the one public, there were a couple other guys

02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:12.500
that got away that they didn't publicly mention.

02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:14.980
One, his name was Tron.

02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:17.020
In the zero?

02:11:17.020 --> 02:11:18.060
Yeah, exactly.

02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:20.900
But he went by the screen name Tron.

02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:25.220
He had access, almost unfettered access to Bank of America.

02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:29.500
So what happens is they identified the guy,

02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:31.740
Secret Service is in the air to go get him.

02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:33.300
They call the Ukrainian police.

02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:34.740
Hey, we're coming down to arrest this guy.

02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:37.900
Ukrainian cops are like, oh, come on down.

02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:39.220
So as soon as they got off the phone,

02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:42.300
Ukrainian cops get in the car, go down and tell Tron,

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:44.420
hey, they're coming to get you.

02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:47.740
So he bugs out down to South America

02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:48.820
and they don't catch him, I think,

02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:51.660
for six or seven years after that, something like that.

02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:52.660
Caught him eventually.

02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:53.500
Caught him eventually.

02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:55.700
Well, let me actually ask you on this point.

02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:58.900
You said that if you do cyber crime,

02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:00.860
eventually it's not gonna end well.

02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:02.180
It does not end well.

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:03.740
Why is that?

02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:06.300
So I don't wanna say that's because you're gonna be arrested

02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:10.180
because honestly, very few people are arrested, all right?

02:12:10.180 --> 02:12:13.700
But it doesn't end well because of the type of person

02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.660
that you become.

02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:20.660
You quoted me earlier, you lie to everybody around you.

02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:23.300
You lie to yourself, you lie to your friends,

02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.740
you lie to your family, of course you lie to your victims.

02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:27.900
You don't have any friends.

02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:30.820
I went 20 years without friends.

02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:33.460
I had associates, I didn't have friends.

02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:35.260
You can't truly trust anybody.

02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:36.660
You don't trust anybody.

02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:37.860
You don't trust anybody.

02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:41.580
I had my wife, I was married for nine years.

02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:46.140
I lied to her every single day of those nine years.

02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:49.660
And it took her nine years to give up on me,

02:12:49.660 --> 02:12:52.460
to realize that I was that piece of shit.

02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:55.420
And she leaves at that point.

02:12:55.420 --> 02:12:58.220
Then from there, I started dating a stripper

02:12:58.220 --> 02:12:59.860
and lied to her.

02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:00.780
I thought I had friends.

02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:02.620
I lied to all those people that I knew

02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:04.660
that thought they were my friends.

02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:06.860
I lied to them the entire time.

02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:08.700
You become that individual.

02:13:09.700 --> 02:13:12.100
I don't think a lot of people really understand

02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:14.380
how bad that is.

02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:17.180
You talked about, you pointed out that woman

02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:18.020
that I ripped off.

02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:20.100
She was trying to put a roof on her house

02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:22.020
for freaking kids, man.

02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:23.660
You're that person.

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:24.860
You're that person.

02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:27.420
So you're also lying to yourself.

02:13:29.020 --> 02:13:32.540
And that's not a mindset in which you can

02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:38.500
grow as a person, find happiness,

02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:41.020
find genuine, simple human affection,

02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:42.900
which is what love is.

02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:46.060
Simple, real, friendship, all of those things.

02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:48.300
So I went to prison, of course.

02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:50.540
One of the most important lessons

02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:52.500
that I've learned in prison,

02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:54.420
because cyber crime, crime as a whole,

02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:56.900
if you're a criminal, it's an addiction.

02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:57.900
If you're addicted to something,

02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:00.460
whether it be drugs, crime, gambling, what have you,

02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:01.700
if you're addicted to something,

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:05.820
you cannot love anything else except the addiction.

02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:08.620
The addiction comes first, all right?

02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:12.660
And you pointed out some of those truly despicable things.

02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:16.060
Script, for example, tortures that guy.

02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:17.980
You get to the point where it's like,

02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:20.540
okay, this is the business.

02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:25.380
And I tried to convince myself that I'm a businessman,

02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:27.140
but I'm a good guy on the other end.

02:14:27.140 --> 02:14:28.620
And you're not, you're not.

02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:31.980
So those lies become part of it, everything else.

02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:34.900
And, you know, it's, yeah,

02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:37.020
you get the higher ups are usually arrested.

02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:37.860
They are, but you know,

02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:40.300
you've got millions of cyber criminals these days.

02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:43.100
So most guys are not going to be arrested.

02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:44.980
So you may be arrested.

02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:49.500
You may, you may be like freaking Jonathan James.

02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:53.060
He was a minor, a very, very talented individual,

02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:54.260
very competent.

02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:59.020
He had, as a kid, he had broke into NASA, DOD, Pentagon.

02:14:59.020 --> 02:15:01.500
He shut the NASA computers down for six weeks.

02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:03.460
This is like that kid.

02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:06.100
Then he decides he wants to go into credit card theft,

02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:08.540
partners with Albert, he's arrested with Albert.

02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:12.340
Law enforcement, they were going to,

02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:13.220
they were going to blame him.

02:15:13.220 --> 02:15:15.940
He was the only competent individual.

02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:19.260
So this kid gets up one day, he wasn't in prison yet.

02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:21.180
He gets up one day, goes in his dad's bedroom,

02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:24.300
gets out his 45, walks in the bathroom

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:26.540
and blows his brains out.

02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:28.940
You know, you've got, you've got things like that,

02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:31.220
or you're going to rip somebody off

02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:32.980
and you're going to end up like scripted with that guy,

02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:37.260
the guy who hit, who ran Evolution Marketplace.

02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:40.780
No one knew who, two people ran that, a guy and a girl.

02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:42.820
And no one knew who they were.

02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:45.060
He ends up stealing about $24 million,

02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:46.860
a lot of from Ukrainian mob.

02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:49.300
And they found him about a year later on a beach

02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:51.140
without his head and hands.

02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:53.340
But, you know, it always goes south,

02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:57.420
but more than anything to me, the negative thing

02:15:57.420 --> 02:15:59.540
is you really become somebody

02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:05.740
that, I mean, just truly a despicable human being.

02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:07.340
When you get to the point,

02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:11.980
when you're destroying people's retirement accounts,

02:16:11.980 --> 02:16:13.380
you're stealing money from a woman

02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:18.220
that simply wants to do something good for her family.

02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:20.580
When you become that individual

02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:23.260
and you're okay with that, my God, man.

02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:26.380
I got to the point, I had one guy I ripped off,

02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:27.620
it's like for $900.

02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:29.940
And when I first started the cyber crime stuff,

02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:31.980
this one, I was becoming competent.

02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:35.540
And I ripped him off for like $900.

02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:40.540
And he sent me an email and he was like,

02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:42.700
the email said something like,

02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:47.700
I guess you needed the money and it's okay.

02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:48.900
You know, you keep it.

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:52.020
And I'm getting chills right now thinking about it,

02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:57.020
it's that where you become that individual,

02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:01.020
yeah.

02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:03.500
Can I actually backtrack?

02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:06.300
Listen, I love love, okay?

02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:07.140
I do too.

02:17:07.140 --> 02:17:11.340
And there's a story that you fell in love with a stripper.

02:17:11.340 --> 02:17:13.220
I mean, you have to tell the story.

02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:17.260
So how did you fall in love with somebody,

02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:19.060
not there's anything wrong with that profession,

02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:20.820
but it's romantic.

02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:23.780
It's like the true romance, by the way, great movie.

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:24.980
It is a great film.

02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:26.660
It's truly a great film.

02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:31.100
Even Brad Pitt, who makes a brief appearance is genius.

02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:32.860
There's so much good acting there.

02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:35.780
Anyway, so tell me that love story.

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:39.580
All right, so like I said, I get from my dad,

02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:41.900
I get that fear of being abandoned.

02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:45.540
I lied to my wife for nine years until she leaves.

02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:48.100
And I was in Charleston, South Carolina.

02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:51.900
And what happened was I noticed that Susan,

02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:56.180
she was not coming to bed like she used to.

02:17:56.180 --> 02:17:57.540
She'd stay up all night long.

02:17:57.540 --> 02:18:01.100
And sometimes she'd go and be gone a few hours

02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:02.220
or then everything else.

02:18:02.220 --> 02:18:03.420
And I'm like, well, something's going on.

02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:05.540
And I'd pass by her computer

02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:07.020
and she would minimize the screens.

02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:08.860
And I'm like, well, gotta figure out

02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:10.900
what the hell is going on.

02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:13.420
So put a key logger on her system.

02:18:13.420 --> 02:18:17.180
As anybody should in a relationship.

02:18:17.180 --> 02:18:20.900
Absolutely, cause you trust them, why not?

02:18:20.900 --> 02:18:22.380
You should be tracking all their movements,

02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:23.220
all their threats.

02:18:23.220 --> 02:18:24.220
Exactly, exactly.

02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:26.020
Like I said, I was the control freak too.

02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:26.860
It's romantic.

02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:29.540
So I found out she had been cheating on me.

02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:30.380
And she was-

02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:31.940
See, there you go, they had a reason.

02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:34.020
They had a reason, I justified.

02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:35.340
So I found out she was cheating on me.

02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:36.820
She was asleep when I found it out.

02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:40.020
And I sat there looking at it and I was like, well, shit.

02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:43.500
So got up, walked in the bedroom, opened up the wardrobe,

02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:46.700
got a suitcase out, started putting her clothes in it.

02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:48.340
Then she wakes up, she's like, where are you going?

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:51.380
I'm like, I'm not, you are.

02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:54.740
Well, my bravado disappeared pretty quickly.

02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:59.740
I took about a week of both of us crying and arguing

02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:01.420
and everything else.

02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:06.420
And she finally left and I went through this depression.

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:09.460
I went, I was in Charleston, South Carolina.

02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:10.540
I would just walk around the house,

02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:12.980
kind of stumbling in a daze.

02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:15.260
Realized I was getting suicidal

02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:18.540
and was smart enough to do something about it.

02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:19.860
And picked up the phone book.

02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:22.700
And that's where there's always this sense of humor.

02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:23.540
So I picked up the phone book

02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:24.740
and I'm going through the yellow pages.

02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:27.300
I'm like, psychologist, criminal psychologist,

02:19:27.300 --> 02:19:28.340
cause I need that.

02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:32.260
Called the psychologist, crying to her.

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:33.780
I'm crying on the phone, told her everything.

02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:35.420
I'm this criminal, this is what's happened.

02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:36.820
She's like, come in now.

02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:41.820
So I go in, spill my guts and saw her for about four months.

02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:43.500
And I joke about it, but it's true.

02:19:43.500 --> 02:19:47.460
She was trying to get me to stop breaking the law

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:48.900
and to go into real estate.

02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:52.060
And I remember telling her, is there a difference?

02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:54.700
She was like, yes, there's a difference.

02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:56.060
So saw her for about four months.

02:19:56.060 --> 02:19:58.060
I was, I was 34.

02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:02.300
I didn't start drinking until I was 34.

02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:04.740
Had never done drugs, anything else like that.

02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:07.100
Cause my mom was an addict as well.

02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:09.780
So I was this guy that always wanted to be in control.

02:20:09.780 --> 02:20:13.580
Didn't want to, you know, lose control of myself.

02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:15.860
And had never been to strip club.

02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:19.500
So one night I was getting lonely.

02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:20.780
So I walked into the strip club.

02:20:20.780 --> 02:20:22.380
Actually, I was researched this strip club

02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:27.220
and it was Joe's Roundup in Charleston, South Carolina.

02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:30.260
Joe's Roundup, little bitty hole in the wall stuff.

02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:32.300
I was, yeah, real classy.

02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:36.620
So I walked in and I'm literally that guy, man,

02:20:36.620 --> 02:20:38.740
that fell in love with the first,

02:20:38.740 --> 02:20:41.420
the first stripper that he sees.

02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:44.380
She walks by, I'm like, that one.

02:20:44.380 --> 02:20:46.180
So I didn't know, I didn't know the strip club game.

02:20:46.180 --> 02:20:48.300
Again, criminal, naive as hell.

02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:52.420
So belly up at the bar, order the beer.

02:20:52.420 --> 02:20:54.380
I'm sitting there drinking it.

02:20:54.380 --> 02:20:57.780
She comes over to me and we start talking.

02:20:57.780 --> 02:21:00.980
And she's like, would you like to get a bottle of champagne?

02:21:00.980 --> 02:21:03.140
I was like, does, does that mean going in back or what?

02:21:03.140 --> 02:21:04.860
She's like, well, yeah, you need to do the bottle

02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:05.700
to come back.

02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:08.020
And I was like, sure, let's buy a bottle of champagne.

02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:10.140
$400 bottle of Corbel.

02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:13.260
So I'm like, all right.

02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:15.380
And again, that bravado disappears pretty quickly.

02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:18.820
I get back there and we talk for two hours.

02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:21.100
And nowadays I understand that most men

02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:22.780
who go to strip clubs,

02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:25.180
the strippers are their therapist most of the time.

02:21:25.180 --> 02:21:26.020
All right.

02:21:26.020 --> 02:21:27.740
So I'm sitting there talking, we're talking.

02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:29.580
And of course, she's, she's sizing me up.

02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:30.580
She's looking at the watch.

02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:32.460
She's like, what kind of car you drive?

02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:34.580
Everything else.

02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:36.180
And I'm like telling her and talking.

02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:39.060
And so at the end of the night, I'm like, really nice to meet.

02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:41.860
She's like, it's so nice meeting you too.

02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:42.940
So I leave.

02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:45.380
You guys just talked.

02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:46.220
Just talked.

02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:47.060
And there's no dancing.

02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:48.820
And there's no feeling of love and all of that.

02:21:48.820 --> 02:21:49.660
Yeah.

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:51.180
So just talk, just, you know, got along pretty good.

02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:54.300
I'm like, I like her, I like her.

02:21:54.300 --> 02:21:56.980
So come back in a week later,

02:21:56.980 --> 02:21:59.500
walk in and call her over.

02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:01.740
And I was like, look, I said, I'm not,

02:22:01.740 --> 02:22:03.340
I said, that was my first time to a strip club.

02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:04.860
I said, don't know you, I like you.

02:22:04.860 --> 02:22:05.820
I'd like to know you more.

02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:07.820
Would you like to go out to dinner?

02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:10.140
And she was like, yeah.

02:22:10.180 --> 02:22:11.940
And I was like, where would you like to go?

02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:13.780
So she says, rude to John.

02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:15.540
And I was like, don't know what it is.

02:22:15.540 --> 02:22:16.380
That's where we'll go.

02:22:16.380 --> 02:22:17.860
So I go back and I was,

02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:19.580
I had a theater buddy at that point in time,

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:21.060
cause I was trying to get my life,

02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:23.140
yeah, trying to get my life together.

02:22:23.140 --> 02:22:24.380
JC was his name.

02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:25.580
And I was like, I got a date.

02:22:25.580 --> 02:22:26.780
He's like, he got a date.

02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:27.860
I was like, yeah, man, I got a date.

02:22:27.860 --> 02:22:30.380
And he's like, okay, where are you going?

02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:31.460
I was like, rude to John.

02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:33.340
And he's like, take your wallet.

02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:35.380
I'm like, yeah.

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:37.580
And he's like, take your wallet.

02:22:37.580 --> 02:22:38.940
It's like, all right.

02:22:38.940 --> 02:22:43.740
So we start doing the lunch and the dinner thing.

02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:46.660
And I get to where I really like her.

02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:48.740
She's, I was 34.

02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:51.860
She was 23 and got along really well.

02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:54.260
Listen, had common interest in music

02:22:54.260 --> 02:22:56.500
and arts and stuff like that.

02:22:56.500 --> 02:22:58.580
She had, I mean, it's stereotypical.

02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:01.220
She was, she had graduated college

02:23:01.220 --> 02:23:04.580
with a degree in religious studies.

02:23:04.580 --> 02:23:06.380
Well, yeah.

02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:07.740
So I was like, all right.

02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:08.860
So.

02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:09.980
So yeah, you just fell in love.

02:23:09.980 --> 02:23:12.620
Yeah, we got along really well, really well.

02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:14.580
So I ended up moving her in with me.

02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:16.420
She hadn't quit her job.

02:23:16.420 --> 02:23:21.420
And what was happening was she was working weekends

02:23:21.900 --> 02:23:25.300
and the club would close at three or four.

02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:30.220
She wouldn't come home until 10 or 11 in the morning.

02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:33.260
And most of the time it would be a phone call saying,

02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:34.100
come and pick me up.

02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:35.900
I can't drive home.

02:23:35.900 --> 02:23:39.660
And then I'd never used drugs, had never been around.

02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:42.340
And my mom, volume and pot and things like that.

02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:43.820
But as far as interacting with her,

02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:45.500
I'd never done anything like that.

02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:47.220
By this point in time,

02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:48.820
I'm kind of getting head over heels with her.

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:50.300
I've moved her in with me and everything.

02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:54.260
And I had never, I was 34.

02:23:54.260 --> 02:23:55.780
I had never went through a woman's purse

02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:57.700
in my entire life.

02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:00.900
And so she comes in, passes out.

02:24:01.820 --> 02:24:04.420
And I'm like, I gotta know what the fuck's going on.

02:24:04.420 --> 02:24:09.420
And went over and went through a purse, found cocaine.

02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:13.100
And you know, the straw cut off straws and all that stuff.

02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:15.420
And I'm like, broke my heart.

02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:20.420
I just sat there and started crying, got online.

02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:23.340
And I'm the guy that can find information.

02:24:23.340 --> 02:24:26.820
So I started looking for forums on strip clubs,

02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:29.740
found a forum, found that one,

02:24:29.740 --> 02:24:33.980
found where it was talking about her prostitute herself

02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:35.020
to support the habit.

02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:40.540
And that got me, man.

02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:41.380
That got me.

02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:45.700
It was talking about everything she was doing to do that.

02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:46.980
And I broke your heart there.

02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:49.540
Oh man, yeah.

02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:53.700
So I didn't have the heart to tell her

02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:55.860
that I knew she was a prostitute.

02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:57.940
But I went to her and I was like, she was waking up.

02:24:57.940 --> 02:25:01.260
And I was like, look, I found this in your purse.

02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:02.700
I can't have that.

02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:04.500
And she's like, well, you think I'm prostituting?

02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:06.340
I was like, no, no, I don't think that.

02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:08.740
I knew it, but I didn't mention it to her.

02:25:08.740 --> 02:25:11.820
And I was like, I can't have that.

02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:13.140
Well, I don't do that.

02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:14.060
It's just a one time thing.

02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:15.540
I was like, all right.

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:19.180
So she went back to work and continued to do it

02:25:19.180 --> 02:25:20.140
for a couple more weeks.

02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:23.020
And then finally I was like, I can't.

02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:24.260
So I picked her up one morning.

02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:28.740
I was like, she couldn't drive home.

02:25:28.740 --> 02:25:30.980
Before I picked her up, I had written her a note,

02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:32.860
left it on the pillow.

02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:35.580
So I brought her home, tucked her in the bed,

02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:41.580
and told her I'd be back that night.

02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:43.900
Told her she had a letter when she woke up.

02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:46.860
And the letter was basically, you know, I love you.

02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:50.620
If you can't stop this, don't be here when I get back.

02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:59.620
And I went to Columbia that day, came back that night,

02:25:59.620 --> 02:26:11.580
and she had quit her job, and she quit drugs that night.

02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:13.620
Really quit.

02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:21.900
And I got it in my head that I needed

02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:25.100
to do whatever I needed to do to make sure

02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:26.420
she didn't go back to that.

02:26:26.420 --> 02:26:32.420
That became, to me, because of my background,

02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:34.420
that meant spending a lot of money.

02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:39.420
And so every night was $300 to $600 for dinner.

02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:46.420
It was $1,000 shoes every week, $2,000 purse every week, all that.

02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:51.420
I had most of my money laundered out to Estonia.

02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:59.420
And Elizabeth, at the same time, she quit.

02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:06.420
But she didn't want me to go anywhere.

02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:07.420
All right.

02:27:07.420 --> 02:27:09.420
She wanted me there all the time.

02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:11.420
I guess that was that connection.

02:27:11.420 --> 02:27:15.420
I guess she was scared she might go back to something.

02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:18.420
So Shadow Crew gets busted.

02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:21.420
Shadow Crew gets busted.

02:27:21.420 --> 02:27:24.420
I go through basically all my US funds.

02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:26.420
Can't get anything from overseas.

02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:28.420
Shadow Crew gets busted in October.

02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:32.420
I can't go into committing tax fraud because season's over.

02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:35.420
Can't go back into credit fraud because Shadow Crew's been busted.

02:27:35.420 --> 02:27:37.420
I don't know who to trust online.

02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:41.420
I'm left with running counterfeit cashier's checks to get money in,

02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:46.420
trying to make it until I can start back with some other fraud

02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:49.420
and lying to her the entire time.

02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:51.420
She knows about none of this.

02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:53.420
None of it.

02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:56.420
And she thinks I've got a shitload of money.

02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:59.420
And she's got expensive taste.

02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:06.420
And at the same time, she couldn't be intimate.

02:28:06.420 --> 02:28:08.420
I mean, the girl loved me.

02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:12.420
That's the first time I've really said that.

02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:15.420
So there's a deep love there, both ways.

02:28:15.420 --> 02:28:18.420
Yeah.

02:28:18.420 --> 02:28:21.420
The things we do.

02:28:21.420 --> 02:28:30.420
So she couldn't be intimate unless she was stone cold drunk.

02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:34.420
I mean, just shit, stone cold drunk.

02:28:34.420 --> 02:28:37.420
And shit, I didn't mind her drinking alcohol.

02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:40.420
I'd rather have that than cocaine.

02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:44.420
So that was the intimacy there.

02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:53.420
And I kept thinking if I continued to invest, that it would work out.

02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:56.420
You know, that just keep going.

02:28:56.420 --> 02:28:58.420
She'll be all right.

02:28:58.420 --> 02:29:03.420
We'll be all right.

02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:07.420
And what happens is, like I said, she thought I had money.

02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:09.420
She thought I had money.

02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:11.420
She wanted a couple of Tiffany engagement rings.

02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:13.420
So I said, we can get married.

02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:17.420
You know, I figured a marriage, show her that I love her, show her it's going to be all right.

02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:20.420
So I was like, oh, let's get married.

02:29:20.420 --> 02:29:23.420
She's like, wow, I've always wanted a Tiffany ring.

02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:26.420
Shit, I didn't have money to buy the Tiffany ring because all my money was overseas.

02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:27.420
So here I am.

02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:28.420
I defraud.

02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:30.420
So it's counterfeit cashiers.

02:29:30.420 --> 02:29:39.420
I find like a three carat ring on eBay for 20 grand and pay for it with a counterfeit cashiers check.

02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:44.420
At the same time, because she doesn't want me to leave, she needs me there.

02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:48.420
Typically, if you're doing that type of crime, you need to be traveling.

02:29:48.420 --> 02:29:52.420
You can't do it in one central area because you're going to be identified pretty quickly.

02:29:52.420 --> 02:29:56.420
I knew that, but I didn't have much choice.

02:29:56.420 --> 02:30:02.420
So start running counterfeit cashiers checks to get the money to live and everything.

02:30:02.420 --> 02:30:06.420
Get the engagement ring.

02:30:06.420 --> 02:30:11.420
We were scheduled to be married.

02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:21.420
Our wedding date was February 26, 2005, February 8, 2005.

02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:31.420
I've got a Tiffany wedding band, a couple of them coming in, and I get arrested in Charleston, South Carolina.

02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:33.420
And she didn't know.

02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:36.420
So I told her, I said, I've got to go pick up those rings.

02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:39.420
She thought I was just having them sent in.

02:30:39.420 --> 02:30:40.420
So I had to get those rings.

02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:43.420
And I said, we'll go out to dinner after that.

02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:54.420
And I left at like 8 o'clock in the morning and I was arrested at, I think, 1130, something like that.

02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:56.420
Of course, I wanted to call her.

02:30:56.420 --> 02:30:58.420
And the FBI got me.

02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:00.420
It turns out it was controlled delivery.

02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:02.420
There were like 30 agents in the parking lot.

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:03.420
FBI got me.

02:31:03.420 --> 02:31:05.420
Charleston PD got me.

02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:09.420
Within 45 minutes, the Secret Service comes in, takes over that investigation.

02:31:09.420 --> 02:31:13.420
They knew exactly who they had.

02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:18.420
About 7 o'clock at night, they're like, we want to search your house.

02:31:18.420 --> 02:31:23.420
And I was like, look, I'll sign off on the search if you let me go with you so I can see her.

02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:26.420
And they were like, OK.

02:31:26.420 --> 02:31:28.420
So I got to see my phone at that point.

02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:34.420
I had like 140 calls where she had been trying to call all that time.

02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:35.420
She was worried.

02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:36.420
Yeah.

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:40.420
And so they load me up in hell.

02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:46.420
I mean, you talk about 10, 12 cars, 40 agents, everything else.

02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:47.420
She's got a dog at that point.

02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:49.420
I'm scared they're going to shoot the dog.

02:31:49.420 --> 02:31:55.420
And it was dark.

02:31:55.420 --> 02:31:58.420
And they had me walk up and they're all behind me.

02:31:58.420 --> 02:32:03.420
I knock on the door and tell her the police are there and she needs to put the dog up.

02:32:03.420 --> 02:32:04.420
So she does.

02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:07.420
And they come in and just start ransacking.

02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:11.420
Put me in cuffs, set me down, start berating her with questions.

02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:13.420
She had no idea what the hell was going on.

02:32:13.420 --> 02:32:16.420
Were you able to say a word or two to help her understand?

02:32:16.420 --> 02:32:17.420
Yeah, I was trying to tell her.

02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:21.420
And at the same time, they take a watch off her wrist.

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:23.420
They let her keep the ring.

02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:25.420
They're telling her that I'm this guy.

02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:26.420
What's my real name?

02:32:26.420 --> 02:32:29.420
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang across across the board.

02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:30.420
She's probably terrified.

02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:31.420
Oh, yeah.

02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:32.420
Yeah.

02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:33.420
Yeah.

02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:35.420
And I tell her, I was like, look, they're going to arraign me tomorrow.

02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:36.420
Don't come.

02:32:36.420 --> 02:32:37.420
Don't come.

02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:41.420
I said, see what's going on, but don't show up.

02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:43.420
Of course, she's there this morning.

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:44.420
Her dad.

02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:47.420
And she's she's back in the back crying.

02:32:47.420 --> 02:32:49.420
They're reading off the charges.

02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:55.420
I'm under three hundred thousand dollars bond, everything else.

02:32:55.420 --> 02:32:58.420
And that's it.

02:32:58.420 --> 02:33:00.420
They throw me in a cell.

02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:03.420
Meanwhile, more charges keep coming in.

02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:09.420
You know, and it's like 10, 12 charges a day at that point.

02:33:09.420 --> 02:33:13.420
And I'm trying to call her to make sure she's all right.

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:16.420
And does it get through?

02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:18.420
So I spent three months in jail.

02:33:18.420 --> 02:33:21.420
And during that three months, she visits twice.

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:25.420
I get like three or four phone calls to her.

02:33:25.420 --> 02:33:26.420
I was looking back now.

02:33:26.420 --> 02:33:27.420
I understand why.

02:33:27.420 --> 02:33:29.420
You know, back then it was like, I'm the victim.

02:33:29.420 --> 02:33:31.420
You know, why doesn't she talk to me?

02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:36.420
But, you know, now I understand why the girl loved me, too.

02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:38.420
You know, she found out I was this piece of shit.

02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:45.420
And after a week in county jail, two agents fly in from New Jersey,

02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:50.420
two Secret Service guys pull me out of cell, looked at me and they're like,

02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:51.420
we've got your laptop.

02:33:51.420 --> 02:33:52.420
I was like, yeah.

02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:55.420
And he's like, well, have you got anything on your laptop?

02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:57.420
I was like, yeah. He's like, you're going to be charged for it.

02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:58.420
I was like, I figured.

02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:04.420
And then he looks at me is like, can you do anything for us?

02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:08.420
And I told him my exact words were, look, you let me get back with Elizabeth.

02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:10.420
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:13.420
And he looks at me is like, we're going to get you out.

02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:14.420
I was like, all right.

02:34:14.420 --> 02:34:21.420
So they let me sit there for three months to get a taste of it and get me out.

02:34:21.420 --> 02:34:24.420
My sister, they have the bond reduced to a thousand dollars.

02:34:24.420 --> 02:34:26.420
My sister pays the thousand dollar bond.

02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:30.420
By this point, she's disowned me because I'm dating the stripper.

02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:35.420
And Denise bonds me out.

02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:39.420
The person that I call immediately is Elizabeth.

02:34:39.420 --> 02:34:40.420
I'm out.

02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:42.420
And she's like, I'll be there.

02:34:42.420 --> 02:34:43.420
Okay.

02:34:43.420 --> 02:34:47.420
So that's like 11 o'clock at night.

02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:51.420
I'm in the parking lot of the Charleston Police, Charleston County Jail.

02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:54.420
Me and a Secret Service agent standing there.

02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:57.420
And Elizabeth had a friend that owned a limo company.

02:34:57.420 --> 02:35:07.420
So she pulls up in a limo, gets out, pops the trunk, gets these two plastic containers out that have my clothes in them.

02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:11.420
Comes over, hugs me, call me later.

02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:13.420
Gets in the car, drives off.

02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:15.420
I'm sitting there crying like a baby.

02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:16.420
Agent looks at me.

02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:18.420
Is that your fiance?

02:35:18.420 --> 02:35:19.420
I'm like, yeah.

02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:21.420
And he's like, I am so sorry.

02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:23.420
And I'm like, yeah.

02:35:23.420 --> 02:35:24.420
I had.

02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:26.420
She sounds fascinating.

02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:27.420
Yeah.

02:35:27.420 --> 02:35:30.420
Pull up in a limo.

02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:33.420
I had $30,000.

02:35:33.420 --> 02:35:38.420
I had $30 in my name at that point.

02:35:38.420 --> 02:35:39.420
$30.

02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:43.420
The agent had to pay for my hotel room that first night.

02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:46.420
So he drops me off after paying for the hotel room, buy me something to eat.

02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:55.420
As soon as he drops me off, I take that $30, walk a half mile to Walmart, buy a prepaid debit card so I can start back in tax fraud.

02:35:55.420 --> 02:35:59.420
As soon as I get back to the hotel room, call Elizabeth, beg her to come see me.

02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:02.420
She comes to see me and we talk most of the night.

02:36:02.420 --> 02:36:05.420
And convince her to give me a chance.

02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:07.420
I tell her that everything's going to be all right.

02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:08.420
They're going to hire me.

02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:10.420
I'm going to be this big consultant.

02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:11.420
Lies.

02:36:11.420 --> 02:36:12.420
Lies.

02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:14.420
Just so she'd get back with me.

02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:16.420
And she's like, OK.

02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:20.420
And so we move from Charleston.

02:36:20.420 --> 02:36:24.420
The field office is in Columbia, South Carolina.

02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:27.420
And I'm breaking the law.

02:36:27.420 --> 02:36:30.420
Even before I start working with them, I'm breaking the law.

02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:34.420
And so they've got me in the office, the field offices.

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:36.420
They got this big war room in there.

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:38.420
I'm on a laptop outside line.

02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:42.420
Laptops hooked up to a 50 inch plasma monitor on the wall.

02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:47.420
They've got a desktop sitting directly next to me outside line.

02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:54.420
Two Secret Service officers in the room at all times with a South Carolina law enforcement officer.

02:36:54.420 --> 02:36:58.420
My job is four to six hours a day surfing the web.

02:36:58.420 --> 02:37:04.420
Picking up targets, intel, teaching them how cybercrime operates, everything else like that.

02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:08.420
For the first two weeks, they are extremely diligent.

02:37:08.420 --> 02:37:11.420
They pay attention to everything that's going on, ask questions, everything else.

02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:19.420
But the problem is that that shit gets boring real quick because I'm very fast online doing that.

02:37:19.420 --> 02:37:22.420
So they're like, what the hell is he doing?

02:37:22.420 --> 02:37:25.420
And it gets tiring looking at a guy just doing that shit.

02:37:25.420 --> 02:37:34.420
So after two weeks, they get lazy and bored and they start watching porn instead of watching me.

02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:40.420
At the same time, they've got a keylogger and they've got Spectre Pro and Camtasia keyloggers

02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:43.420
and taking snapshots of everything that I'm doing.

02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:46.420
Every night it goes on a DVD rom on a spindle.

02:37:46.420 --> 02:37:51.420
So I'm like, they're not going to go through that shit.

02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:53.420
So I'm like, fuck it.

02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:57.420
Start breaking all from inside Secret Service offices while they're in the room.

02:37:57.420 --> 02:37:59.420
Why not?

02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:03.420
That continues for 10 months.

02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:11.420
At the same time, the relationship with Elizabeth fell apart, completely fell apart.

02:38:11.420 --> 02:38:18.420
Do you have an understanding of why it's just because of her heart got broken because there was lying?

02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:19.420
It was the trust.

02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:32.420
She did a lot to sacrifice for the you've got you got a woman there that she had even said it.

02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:40.420
She was like she had told one of her friends we were out having dinner one night.

02:38:40.420 --> 02:38:42.420
And this is before I got arrested.

02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:49.420
She told one of her friends that I was the only guy that ever asked her to stop using drugs.

02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:51.420
Yeah, yeah.

02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:57.420
Yeah, I mean, I have to say that that part of the story is so powerful.

02:38:57.420 --> 02:39:03.420
And then that she chose to do it and she chose to stop.

02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:10.420
And she told me that there was one instance she told me that if she didn't marry me, she'd never be married.

02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:15.420
And as far as I know, she's never been married.

02:39:15.420 --> 02:39:17.420
And so it started to fall apart there.

02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:23.420
Yeah, because I was a piece of shit.

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:30.420
Still, you didn't take a step by the way, can I just say how just moving it is how honest you are.

02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:31.420
But thank you.

02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:34.420
Thank you for being that person.

02:39:34.420 --> 02:39:38.420
But at that time, you there's still that line.

02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:40.420
Oh, man, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:43.420
So it's falling apart.

02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:49.420
She had she wants to start going to strip clubs and I'm like, fuck it.

02:39:49.420 --> 02:39:51.420
Why not? We'll go.

02:39:51.420 --> 02:39:58.420
So we start going to strip clubs and she's you know, she'll come back and be wasted and we'll have sex, what have you.

02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:07.420
And one night she looks at me and she was like.

02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:12.420
She was like, I think it'd be funny if you got a blowjob from somebody else.

02:40:12.420 --> 02:40:16.420
And that got me, that got me.

02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:20.420
I was like, to me, that was the final straw right there.

02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:25.420
I was like, she doesn't care for me anymore, anything else like that.

02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:26.420
We've been going to strip clubs.

02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:33.420
So I started dating another stripper and she knew something was going on.

02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:38.420
And she looks at me one day and she's like, why don't you just tell me that it's over?

02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:40.420
And I looked at her, I said, it's over.

02:40:40.420 --> 02:40:41.420
We're done.

02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:49.420
And I told her, I was like, look, I said, whatever you want, we rent an apartment.

02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:52.420
I was like, whatever you want in here, take it.

02:40:52.420 --> 02:41:01.420
And I said, not only that, but I'll make sure you got money.

02:41:01.420 --> 02:41:02.420
For several months.

02:41:02.420 --> 02:41:03.420
So you're all right.

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:11.420
And I was like, just leave me, you know, leave my TV and leave, leave me some, some plates and stuff.

02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:18.420
So I go to work that day at the Secret Service, come back that night and she's taken everything

02:41:18.420 --> 02:41:22.420
and left a picture of herself in the bedroom, on the floor.

02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:26.420
I'm like, okay, I guess I deserve that.

02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:28.420
She's got, I like her.

02:41:28.420 --> 02:41:33.420
She was cool, she was cool.

02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:37.420
I'm giving her a thousand dollars like every two weeks for some shit like this.

02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:43.420
And it gets to the point because I'm doing this tax fraud from inside the offices.

02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:47.420
Well, the debit card companies are pinging the cards.

02:41:47.420 --> 02:41:51.420
They start to realize that, hey, some son of a bitch is stealing money using our debit cards.

02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:54.420
So they start to shut down the cards before I can pull cash out.

02:41:54.420 --> 02:41:57.420
So I start not to have the money to send to her.

02:41:57.420 --> 02:42:02.420
And I'm like, so she calls and she's like, look, I have to have money.

02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:05.420
And I was like, well, look, I'm doing what I can.

02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:06.420
You promised money.

02:42:06.420 --> 02:42:11.420
And I was like, look, if you knew what I was doing to get this money, you wouldn't be asking that.

02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:13.420
And she's like, I need money.

02:42:13.420 --> 02:42:16.420
My rent's behind by a month right now.

02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:18.420
And I'm like, your rent's behind?

02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:19.420
She's like, yeah.

02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:20.420
So I was like, okay.

02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:23.420
So I pick up the phone, call the rental office.

02:42:23.420 --> 02:42:29.420
And I was like, I just want to make sure that, you know, I'm sorry I'm behind on the rent for this apartment number.

02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:33.420
Oh, no, that rent's paid up three months.

02:42:33.420 --> 02:42:35.420
It's like, okay, hang up, call Elizabeth back.

02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:37.420
I was like, you're behind on the rent.

02:42:37.420 --> 02:42:39.420
And she was like, yeah.

02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:41.420
And I was like, funny.

02:42:41.420 --> 02:42:43.420
They just say you're up on it three months.

02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:47.420
And she gets quiet and she's like, well, you lied to me too.

02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:50.420
And I was like, you're right.

02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:52.420
I did. I did that.

02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:54.420
I was like, but look, I can't do it anymore.

02:42:54.420 --> 02:43:00.420
And that's the last time I spoke to her right there.

02:43:00.420 --> 02:43:07.420
What happens is I was breaking law from inside the offices.

02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:12.420
I had a buddy that his name was Sean Mims out of Los Angeles.

02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:16.420
I had taught him how to do tax return fraud.

02:43:16.420 --> 02:43:18.420
I told Sean, I go missing, right?

02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:19.420
I go missing for three months.

02:43:19.420 --> 02:43:22.420
I told him if I ever went missing, not to contact me.

02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:26.420
And so I go missing, then I show back up online.

02:43:26.420 --> 02:43:28.420
First day, he contacts.

02:43:28.420 --> 02:43:30.420
So he becomes a target.

02:43:30.420 --> 02:43:33.420
And they identify him pretty quickly at that point.

02:43:33.420 --> 02:43:38.420
He's set to be arrested sometime in March of six.

02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:40.420
That's when he's set to be arrested.

02:43:40.420 --> 02:43:43.420
Operation Rolling Stone was the name of the operation.

02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:45.420
Nine people were supposed to be arrested that night.

02:43:45.420 --> 02:43:49.420
So Secret Service goes and arrest this guy.

02:43:49.420 --> 02:43:53.420
They search his apartment and don't find anything.

02:43:53.420 --> 02:43:56.420
The apartment manager comes out and explains to him how Sean

02:43:56.420 --> 02:43:58.420
has done all kinds of work to the apartment.

02:43:58.420 --> 02:44:02.420
As a matter of fact, he brought in $30,000 worth of Italian tile

02:44:02.420 --> 02:44:05.420
to put in the apartment that he's renting.

02:44:05.420 --> 02:44:08.420
And by the way, last night he had a U-Haul out here

02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:11.420
and took out a whole shitload of stuff.

02:44:11.420 --> 02:44:15.420
So Secret Service comes back in.

02:44:15.420 --> 02:44:16.420
They look at me and they're like,

02:44:16.420 --> 02:44:19.420
we need you to take a polygraph.

02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:22.420
And my answer was, I ain't taking a polygraph.

02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:25.420
So they're like, well, we'll throw you back in jail if you don't.

02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:26.420
And I was like, call my lawyer.

02:44:26.420 --> 02:44:27.420
Lawyer gets me on the phone.

02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:30.420
He's like, you don't have to take the polygraph.

02:44:30.420 --> 02:44:31.420
I was like, well, good, I'm not going to.

02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:33.420
He's like, but they will throw you back in jail.

02:44:33.420 --> 02:44:35.420
And I was like, don't want to do that.

02:44:35.420 --> 02:44:38.420
And he's like, have you done anything?

02:44:38.420 --> 02:44:40.420
And I was like, yeah.

02:44:40.420 --> 02:44:46.420
And he's like, well, you can try to pass the polygraph.

02:44:46.420 --> 02:44:47.420
I'm like, OK.

02:44:47.420 --> 02:44:50.420
So I was like, let's take the polygraph.

02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:51.420
They asked three questions.

02:44:51.420 --> 02:44:55.420
The questions were, have you talked to anybody?

02:44:55.420 --> 02:44:58.420
Have you been on computer outside of the offices?

02:44:58.420 --> 02:45:00.420
Have you talked to the press, which I was interviewing

02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:03.420
with a New York Times writer the entire time?

02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:06.420
And then have you contacted or warned anybody about investigations?

02:45:06.420 --> 02:45:08.420
And I failed polygraph completely.

02:45:09.420 --> 02:45:11.420
So they revoked the bond.

02:45:11.420 --> 02:45:13.420
Take me back down to Charleston County.

02:45:13.420 --> 02:45:15.420
Throw me into jail.

02:45:15.420 --> 02:45:19.420
Three days later, Secret Service shows back up.

02:45:19.420 --> 02:45:21.420
I had pulled me out of a cell.

02:45:21.420 --> 02:45:23.420
It's Jim Ramicone and Bobby Kirby.

02:45:23.420 --> 02:45:26.420
And they were, I mean, honestly, they were good men.

02:45:26.420 --> 02:45:30.420
And they gave me chances upon chances to do the right thing.

02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:33.420
And I was not ready to do that.

02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:36.420
And Jim Ramicone and Bobby's in there.

02:45:36.420 --> 02:45:38.420
And Bobby, I mean, Bobby was a friend.

02:45:38.420 --> 02:45:40.420
I mean, he truly was.

02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:50.420
Later on, a couple of years ago, I had a chance to have lunch with a man.

02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:54.420
And I told him I was sorry for everything I did to him

02:45:54.420 --> 02:45:57.420
because I got him and another agent fired.

02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:01.420
And I told him I was sorry for what happened.

02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:04.420
And he told me then, he's like, we were your friends, man.

02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:06.420
We were truly your friends.

02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:07.420
So they were good men.

02:46:07.420 --> 02:46:08.420
They wanted to help.

02:46:08.420 --> 02:46:09.420
Yeah.

02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:11.420
They wanted you to be a good man.

02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:12.420
Yeah.

02:46:12.420 --> 02:46:18.420
What got me so damn bad is I told him, I was like, man, I'm trying to be a better guy.

02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:21.420
And he's like, Brett, you always were a good guy.

02:46:21.420 --> 02:46:23.420
You just didn't know it.

02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:24.420
Fuck.

02:46:24.420 --> 02:46:27.420
People like that, we need people like that in this world.

02:46:29.420 --> 02:46:33.420
You need somebody to basically believe that you can be a good man.

02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:35.420
So Jim Ramacone pulls me out.

02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:37.420
He's the second in charge in South Carolina.

02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:41.420
He's got the Miranda waiver in front of him, right?

02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:42.420
And he looks at me.

02:46:42.420 --> 02:46:44.420
He's like, I'm playing hard ass.

02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:47.420
Bobby's over here looking distraught and like a hurt dog.

02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:50.420
And Jim's like, here's the way this is going to work.

02:46:50.420 --> 02:46:54.420
He said, you're going to tell me everything you've done the past six years

02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:59.420
or I'm going to make it my mission in life to fuck over you and your family.

02:46:59.420 --> 02:47:02.420
And he said, not just this case.

02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:06.420
Once you get out of prison, I'll hound you the rest of your life.

02:47:06.420 --> 02:47:10.420
Then he slides the Miranda waiver over and he's like, now you want to talk?

02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:11.420
And I looked at him.

02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:13.420
I was like, nope.

02:47:16.420 --> 02:47:20.420
He gets up, gets all red in the face, storms out as on the way out.

02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:22.420
He's like, fuck you very much.

02:47:22.420 --> 02:47:25.420
So I go back to the cell a week later.

02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:27.420
I was on only under state charges.

02:47:27.420 --> 02:47:30.420
A week later, judge rules.

02:47:30.420 --> 02:47:33.420
They revoke the bond improperly.

02:47:33.420 --> 02:47:34.420
Wow.

02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:37.420
Oh, reinstates the bond.

02:47:37.420 --> 02:47:41.420
Nobody calls the secret service to tell him I walk out.

02:47:41.420 --> 02:47:47.420
I walk out, I was dating this stripper and I told my mom, I was like, well,

02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:51.420
if they're going to fuck me, they're going to have to find me.

02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:53.420
She just went on the move.

02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:54.420
Yeah.

02:47:54.420 --> 02:47:55.420
I called this stripper girl up.

02:47:55.420 --> 02:47:58.420
I had given her like 60 K, some bullshit like that.

02:47:58.420 --> 02:48:01.420
And I told her, I was like, Kim, I need some money.

02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:03.420
And she was like, what?

02:48:03.420 --> 02:48:05.420
I was like, look, I said, give me a thousand dollars.

02:48:05.420 --> 02:48:07.420
I'll give you back $3,000 in two weeks.

02:48:07.420 --> 02:48:08.420
She was like, okay.

02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:14.420
So I met her in Augusta, Georgia and got the thousand from her and started

02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:16.420
driving West on I-20.

02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:18.420
No idea where to go to anything else.

02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:19.420
Got to Dallas.

02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:22.420
There was a prepaid debit card supplier in Dallas.

02:48:22.420 --> 02:48:26.420
Went and walked in the office, convinced the guy, social engineering,

02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:30.420
convinced the guy to give me 60 prepaid debit cards without a driver's license,

02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:32.420
without payment, anything else he did.

02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:34.420
And that started the run.

02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:36.420
I ended up stealing from that.

02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:40.420
I stole like 160 K profit, used that to buy a Jeep Cherokee.

02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:47.420
And the idea was to steal enough money to bug out to Florianopolis, Brazil and

02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:51.420
set up shop down there and do it again.

02:48:51.420 --> 02:48:52.420
That was the dream.

02:48:52.420 --> 02:48:53.420
That was it.

02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:54.420
That was it.

02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:57.420
So I was on the run for four months, stole $600,000.

02:48:57.420 --> 02:49:00.420
I was in Las Vegas, Nevada one day.

02:49:00.420 --> 02:49:02.420
I had stolen the night before.

02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:04.420
I had stolen 160 K out of ATMs.

02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:06.420
Went in the next morning.

02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:11.420
I woke up, signed on to cartersmarket.com, which was run by Max Butler, the Iceman.

02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:15.420
And there's my name, U.S. Most Wanted on it.

02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:18.420
And that gets your attention.

02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:21.420
That was my real name with the U.S. Most Wanted beside of it.

02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:23.420
Nobody knew my real name in that environment at all.

02:49:23.420 --> 02:49:24.420
But then they did.

02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:28.420
And it was talking about me being part of the Secret Service,

02:49:28.420 --> 02:49:30.420
Operation Anglerfish, everything else.

02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:32.420
So, of course, they're all like...

02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:33.420
So everybody's after you.

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:36.420
They're like, oh, yeah, we're going to get this son of a bitch.

02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:39.420
So I sat there looking at it and I was like, said it out loud.

02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:42.420
I was like, well, Mr. Johnson, you've made the United States Most Wanted list.

02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:43.420
What do you do now?

02:49:43.420 --> 02:49:47.420
And I was like, I'm going to Disney World.

02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:48.420
Literally.

02:49:48.420 --> 02:49:49.420
Literally. Literally.

02:49:49.420 --> 02:49:51.420
Said that out loud.

02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:56.420
So loaded up the Jeep, drove from Las Vegas to Orlando, Florida,

02:49:56.420 --> 02:50:02.420
and got the two annual passes, one to Disney World, the other one to Universal Studios.

02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:04.420
Paid for a timeshare.

02:50:04.420 --> 02:50:08.420
They were building these new timeshares right off Universal Drive,

02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:13.420
building these brand new timeshares, paid for a timeshare, nine months cash.

02:50:13.420 --> 02:50:14.420
I was like, we take cash?

02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:15.420
Yeah, we take cash.

02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:17.420
There's $12,900.

02:50:17.420 --> 02:50:18.420
Then it wasn't furnished.

02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:22.420
So I went down to a furniture store, bought $30,000 in furniture.

02:50:22.420 --> 02:50:26.420
They had seized a DVD collection of mine worth 30 grand,

02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:31.420
bought that back and proceeded to go to Disney World every day.

02:50:31.420 --> 02:50:34.420
And that lasted about six weeks.

02:50:34.420 --> 02:50:37.420
They used a trigger fish is what they use nowadays.

02:50:37.420 --> 02:50:41.420
It's called a stingray to find me.

02:50:41.420 --> 02:50:45.420
So one day I was it was like 1030 in the morning on Saturday.

02:50:45.420 --> 02:50:48.420
September 16th was the day 2006.

02:50:48.420 --> 02:50:50.420
Yeah, 2006, September 16th.

02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:55.420
I was used to the builders coming around knocking, making sure everything was all right.

02:50:55.420 --> 02:51:01.420
So I was asleep, heard this knock at the door and get up, look through the keyhole.

02:51:01.420 --> 02:51:03.420
Nobody's there. You know, people, nobody's there.

02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:09.420
I was like, huh, open the door, step out into the hallway, walking down the hall as Bobby Kirby,

02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:14.420
another South Carolina guy and a Orlando Orange County cop.

02:51:14.420 --> 02:51:16.420
And they turn around.

02:51:16.420 --> 02:51:17.420
They're like, hey, Brett.

02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:19.420
I'm like, hey, Bobby, how are you?

02:51:19.420 --> 02:51:20.420
And it's like, we're good.

02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:21.420
How are you? And I'm like, I'm fine.

02:51:21.420 --> 02:51:23.420
Would you like to come in?

02:51:23.420 --> 02:51:25.420
He was like, let's put you in cuffs first.

02:51:25.420 --> 02:51:30.420
And I was like, that's probably a good idea.

02:51:30.420 --> 02:51:32.420
He walks in like those guys.

02:51:32.420 --> 02:51:34.420
He's like, have you got anything in here?

02:51:34.420 --> 02:51:37.420
And I was like, yeah, there's $120,000 in the bedroom.

02:51:37.420 --> 02:51:38.420
And he was like, seriously?

02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:40.420
I was like, yeah, that and an AK-47.

02:51:40.420 --> 02:51:42.420
His face goes white.

02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:44.420
And he's like, you've got a rifle?

02:51:44.420 --> 02:51:46.420
And I was like, no, I'm kidding with you.

02:51:46.420 --> 02:51:49.420
He was like, okay.

02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:56.420
So they throw me in jail in Orange County and they give me diesel therapy.

02:51:56.420 --> 02:52:05.420
And diesel therapy is, it took like two weeks to transport me from Orange County, Orlando to Columbia, South Carolina.

02:52:05.420 --> 02:52:12.420
And what happens is, is you stop at every county jail you possibly can, go through the processing, which is about six hours.

02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:17.420
Once you get to your bunk, hey, time to transport you.

02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:19.420
They do that on purpose?

02:52:19.420 --> 02:52:21.420
On purpose, on purpose.

02:52:21.420 --> 02:52:24.420
Wears you down mentally and physically and everything.

02:52:24.420 --> 02:52:26.420
I get to Columbia, South Carolina.

02:52:26.420 --> 02:52:34.420
Now, while I was at Orange County, what happens is this inmate, because we were in federal holding, this inmate, he looks at me, his name was Yeti.

02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:39.420
And he's like, hey, man, you know, the only time you get off in federal prison is the drug program.

02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:41.420
I was like, well, man, I don't use drugs.

02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:44.420
And he's like, you can find a drug problem, can't you?

02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:47.420
And I was like, I can find a drug problem.

02:52:47.420 --> 02:52:55.420
So what happens is, is every county jail I stop at on the way to Columbia, I tell them I'm alcoholic and cocaine.

02:52:55.420 --> 02:53:01.420
So by the time I get to Columbia, South Carolina, they've got this paper trail of Mr. Johnson requesting help for drugs.

02:53:01.420 --> 02:53:07.420
I had hired Strom Thurmond's son as an attorney.

02:53:07.420 --> 02:53:11.420
They make me drop him because I paid for him with illegal funds.

02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:13.420
So they give me a public defender.

02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:17.420
He gets a psychological evaluation ordered for me.

02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:21.420
So psychologist comes in county jail, four hour interview, about halfway through.

02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:23.420
He looks at me, he's like, use any type of drugs?

02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:24.420
I was like, yeah.

02:53:24.420 --> 02:53:25.420
He's like, what do you use?

02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:27.420
Cocaine, smoke or snort?

02:53:27.420 --> 02:53:28.420
Snort.

02:53:28.420 --> 02:53:29.420
How much?

02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:31.420
An eight ball a day.

02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:32.420
That's a lot.

02:53:32.420 --> 02:53:33.420
Yeah.

02:53:33.420 --> 02:53:35.420
Do you have any trouble out of that?

02:53:35.420 --> 02:53:37.420
Yeah.

02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:39.420
I can't get an erection.

02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:46.420
And he looks at me and I'm looking at him like, because I had gotten that shit from Boogie Nights.

02:53:46.420 --> 02:53:51.420
So I'm like, and finally I'm like, is that right?

02:53:51.420 --> 02:53:53.420
And he was like, it could happen.

02:53:53.420 --> 02:53:55.420
I was like, okay.

02:53:55.420 --> 02:54:00.420
So that makes it into my pre-sentence report.

02:54:00.420 --> 02:54:09.420
So all federal inmates, probation office and prosecutor, they do this detailed background check to basically tell the judge how much time to give you.

02:54:09.420 --> 02:54:10.420
All right.

02:54:10.420 --> 02:54:14.420
So that drug bit with that interview makes it into the PSR.

02:54:14.420 --> 02:54:20.420
So day of interview, I mean, day of sentencing, I'd pled guilty, day of sentencing.

02:54:20.420 --> 02:54:26.420
The prosecutor, he stands up and this dude is screaming at this point.

02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:29.420
And he's like, Mr. Johnson's manipulated the Secret Service.

02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:31.420
He's manipulated the prosecutor.

02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:32.420
Then he points at the judge.

02:54:32.420 --> 02:54:35.420
And he's manipulating you today, Your Honor.

02:54:35.420 --> 02:54:37.420
We insist on the upper limits of the guidelines.

02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:44.420
Well, I had been telling everybody in the jail that if they give me any more than 60 months, I am not staying.

02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:47.420
So they were like, okay, sure.

02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:51.420
So the judge looks at me and she's like, I agree.

02:54:51.420 --> 02:54:54.420
I'm like, she says 75 months.

02:54:54.420 --> 02:54:59.420
So I looked at my lawyer and I was like, can you get the drug program for me?

02:54:59.420 --> 02:55:00.420
He's like, I don't know how I'll ask.

02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:02.420
So he stands up.

02:55:02.420 --> 02:55:05.420
Your Honor, will you order the drug program for Mr. Johnson?

02:55:05.420 --> 02:55:09.420
The judge says no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.

02:55:09.420 --> 02:55:12.420
So the Secret Service had told her, hey, he's full of shit.

02:55:12.420 --> 02:55:14.420
So she's like, no, but I'll recommend he gets evaluated.

02:55:14.420 --> 02:55:16.420
I looked at my lawyer and I was like, what does that mean?

02:55:16.420 --> 02:55:18.420
He was like, you're probably not going to get it.

02:55:18.420 --> 02:55:21.420
And I was like, how soon can you get me to the camp?

02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:25.420
And he was like, well, if you don't appeal, I can get you there pretty quick.

02:55:25.420 --> 02:55:28.420
My exact words were, fuck the appeal.

02:55:28.420 --> 02:55:29.420
Get me to the camp.

02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:31.420
I'll take it from there.

02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:34.420
He looks at me like I'm the biggest idiot in the world.

02:55:34.420 --> 02:55:37.420
I get sent to because you get a camp recommended.

02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:43.420
I have friends, family members look for camps that don't have a fence around them.

02:55:43.420 --> 02:55:45.420
And we settle on Ashland, Kentucky.

02:55:45.420 --> 02:55:51.420
Six weeks later, I'm in Ashland, Kentucky and pull up there, 14-foot fence,

02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:53.420
razor wire on top.

02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:55.420
And I'm like, I don't climb fences.

02:55:55.420 --> 02:55:57.420
So I go in.

02:55:57.420 --> 02:56:01.420
First question I ask is, are there any jobs outside of the fence?

02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:04.420
And he was like, the guard's like, well, you can work in the national forest.

02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:06.420
And I'm like, no, I'll die out there.

02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:09.420
And he was like, well, you could do landscaping.

02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:11.420
I'm like, I could run a wheat eater.

02:56:11.420 --> 02:56:17.420
Two days later, I walk into the landscaping office and the cop, this is this,

02:56:17.420 --> 02:56:22.420
this genius of some of these people and institutions, the cop behind his desk,

02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:28.420
the entire wall is a blown up photo of the compound and the outline area.

02:56:28.420 --> 02:56:32.420
So I can literally sit there and plot where I'm going.

02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:33.420
All right.

02:56:33.420 --> 02:56:39.420
My dad, I hadn't spoken to that man in years.

02:56:40.420 --> 02:56:45.420
And he shows up at my sentencing and stands up in front of the judge.

02:56:45.420 --> 02:56:49.420
He's like, your honor, I want to make sure Brett gets a good start.

02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:52.420
He can live with me when he gets out, everything else.

02:56:52.420 --> 02:56:54.420
Looking back, the man meant that.

02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:57.420
And I just thought it was bullshit at the time.

02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:00.420
So he starts to visit me in prison.

02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:02.420
I mean, yeah, in prison, he starts to visit.

02:57:02.420 --> 02:57:04.420
And about the third visit in, he looks at me.

02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:07.420
He's like, I've been reading about you online.

02:57:07.420 --> 02:57:08.420
I was like, yeah.

02:57:08.420 --> 02:57:09.420
He's like, yeah.

02:57:09.420 --> 02:57:11.420
He's like, that's a lot of money you made.

02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:12.420
I was like, yeah.

02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:18.420
He's like, you think you can teach somebody how to do that?

02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:23.420
And I'm like, so what I used to say, and again, that it's this thing of,

02:57:23.420 --> 02:57:25.420
you know, really coming to terms with things.

02:57:25.420 --> 02:57:31.420
What I used to say was, is I thought my dad was back in my life

02:57:31.420 --> 02:57:33.420
and he was just trying to use me.

02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:34.420
All right.

02:57:34.420 --> 02:57:39.420
The truth of the matter was, is that my dad hadn't really seen me

02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:42.420
except in that frame of crime.

02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:46.420
You know, being that criminal with my mom, everything else.

02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:49.420
I really think that's how the man was trying to communicate with me.

02:57:49.420 --> 02:57:52.420
He wanted to connect with you in the places where you know,

02:57:52.420 --> 02:57:54.420
where you love, where you're interested in,

02:57:54.420 --> 02:57:56.420
where your addiction is essentially.

02:57:56.420 --> 02:58:01.420
And what I did is I manipulated the man into helping me escape.

02:58:01.420 --> 02:58:03.420
So I agreed to teach him how to do tax fraud.

02:58:03.420 --> 02:58:06.420
And in return, he had the only money he had to his name.

02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:08.420
He had $4,000 cash.

02:58:08.420 --> 02:58:12.420
So I manipulated him into giving me that and to drop me off a change of clothes,

02:58:12.420 --> 02:58:14.420
a cell phone, and a driver's license.

02:58:14.420 --> 02:58:17.420
The only driver's license he had was my driver's license, Brett Johnson.

02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:21.420
So I was at the camp for, I don't know, six, eight weeks.

02:58:21.420 --> 02:58:25.420
And the hardest worker that landscaping had ever seen.

02:58:25.420 --> 02:58:30.420
At one point, the cops got me on a mountainside with a broom

02:58:30.420 --> 02:58:31.420
sweeping off the mountain.

02:58:31.420 --> 02:58:33.420
I'm like, yeah, we'll do that. Absolutely.

02:58:33.420 --> 02:58:35.420
So building trust with the guys there.

02:58:35.420 --> 02:58:36.420
Yeah, working my ass off.

02:58:36.420 --> 02:58:37.420
Yeah.

02:58:37.420 --> 02:58:39.420
And then six weeks, I take off.

02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:43.420
And I lasted, I think, two, three weeks, something like that.

02:58:43.420 --> 02:58:44.420
U.S. Marshals, I made it 100.

02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:45.420
Take off, you escaped.

02:58:45.420 --> 02:58:47.420
Yeah, escaped, escaped.

02:58:47.420 --> 02:58:49.420
U.S. Marshals, they're canvassing a three-state area.

02:58:49.420 --> 02:58:51.420
They find me, I think, 250 miles away.

02:58:51.420 --> 02:58:53.420
It's like Lexington, Kentucky.

02:58:53.420 --> 02:58:56.420
They found me in Lexington because I had to use my real driver's license.

02:58:56.420 --> 02:58:58.420
I had a laptop.

02:58:58.420 --> 02:59:02.420
I had prepaid debit cards and I had stolen identity information.

02:59:02.420 --> 02:59:08.420
And the way it got me was I had dyed my hair this flaming red.

02:59:08.420 --> 02:59:09.420
You know, I had this deep tan.

02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:11.420
I didn't look anything like myself.

02:59:11.420 --> 02:59:17.420
And I was at a hotel, had the curtains open, saw this guy.

02:59:17.420 --> 02:59:20.420
I was on the laptop, saw this guy walk by.

02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:25.420
He walks by the window and he stops and then he backs up.

02:59:26.420 --> 02:59:29.420
He looks inside, he knocks on the window.

02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:32.420
I look up at him, he's like, you.

02:59:32.420 --> 02:59:33.420
I was like, me?

02:59:33.420 --> 02:59:34.420
He's like, you.

02:59:34.420 --> 02:59:37.420
Then he pulls out this badge and he points at it.

02:59:37.420 --> 02:59:40.420
He's like, and then he points at the door, now.

02:59:40.420 --> 02:59:42.420
So I was like, oh, okay.

02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:43.420
So I opened up the door.

02:59:43.420 --> 02:59:46.420
He's like, U.S. Marshals Service.

02:59:46.420 --> 02:59:48.420
So they arrest me.

02:59:48.420 --> 02:59:50.420
How did they track you down?

02:59:50.420 --> 02:59:51.420
They canvassed that area.

02:59:51.420 --> 02:59:53.420
They talked to every hotel, everything else.

02:59:53.420 --> 02:59:55.420
So it's like traditional?

02:59:55.420 --> 02:59:56.420
Traditional.

02:59:56.420 --> 02:59:57.420
That's what it was.

02:59:57.420 --> 03:00:00.420
So it wasn't like from the internet they kind of got something?

03:00:00.420 --> 03:00:01.420
Just straight.

03:00:01.420 --> 03:00:04.420
U.S. Marshals are outstanding at everything they do.

03:00:04.420 --> 03:00:05.420
So they arrest me.

03:00:05.420 --> 03:00:10.420
I'm initially held at a county jail in Moorhead, Kentucky.

03:00:10.420 --> 03:00:13.420
That was one hell of an experience there.

03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:16.420
But then I'm transferred after sentencing on that.

03:00:16.420 --> 03:00:19.420
So sentencing, here's the weird thing.

03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:23.420
So I spent like, I think, two or three months at the county jail

03:00:23.420 --> 03:00:25.420
in Moorhead, Kentucky.

03:00:25.420 --> 03:00:27.420
Get sentenced.

03:00:27.420 --> 03:00:33.420
At my sentencing, it happened so quickly after the initial sentencing

03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:35.420
that they used the exact same pre-sentence report.

03:00:35.420 --> 03:00:38.420
The report that's got all that drug shit in there.

03:00:38.420 --> 03:00:45.420
So at my sentencing, prosecutors there, secret services there, judge me

03:00:45.420 --> 03:00:47.420
and my attorney.

03:00:47.420 --> 03:00:48.420
Prosecutor stands up.

03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:51.420
He's like, Your Honor, we would like it if you would consider

03:00:51.420 --> 03:00:54.420
that when Mr. Johnson was arrested, he had a laptop,

03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:56.420
he had all this information with him,

03:00:56.420 --> 03:00:59.420
looks like he was engaged in identity theft, yet again.

03:00:59.420 --> 03:01:02.420
Judge looks at the prosecutor, says no.

03:01:02.420 --> 03:01:04.420
Says, hey, if you were going to charge him with it,

03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:06.420
you should have charged him with it.

03:01:06.420 --> 03:01:08.420
I'm only considering the escape.

03:01:08.420 --> 03:01:09.420
Then he looks at me.

03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:11.420
He's like, Mr. Johnson.

03:01:11.420 --> 03:01:14.420
He said, it looks like by you keeping your mouth shut right now,

03:01:14.420 --> 03:01:17.420
you're really saving yourself a pretty serious charge.

03:01:17.420 --> 03:01:19.420
And my response was, yes, Your Honor.

03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:22.420
And he was like, then he opens up the pre-sentence report.

03:01:22.420 --> 03:01:23.420
He's fingering through it.

03:01:23.420 --> 03:01:26.420
He's like, it also looks like before you got involved

03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:29.420
with all these drugs, you were a pretty good citizen.

03:01:29.420 --> 03:01:32.420
I was like, yes, Your Honor.

03:01:32.420 --> 03:01:34.420
And he's like, so here's what I'm going to do.

03:01:34.420 --> 03:01:38.420
He said, I'm going to give you 18 months on the escape.

03:01:38.420 --> 03:01:39.420
I was like, OK.

03:01:39.420 --> 03:01:42.420
He said, I'm also going to give you, no, it was 15 months on the escape.

03:01:42.420 --> 03:01:44.420
He said, I'm going to give you 15 months on the escape.

03:01:44.420 --> 03:01:48.420
And I'm also going to order the drug program for you.

03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:51.420
I was like, yes, Your Honor.

03:01:51.420 --> 03:01:54.420
So the drug program gives you a year off,

03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:58.420
and it gives you six months and a halfway house.

03:01:58.420 --> 03:02:03.420
So by escaping, I got out of prison three months earlier

03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:05.420
than what I should have gotten out of.

03:02:05.420 --> 03:02:10.420
So the original thing about drugs worked in the long-term.

03:02:10.420 --> 03:02:13.420
The interesting thing with that, and this was the best lie I ever told.

03:02:13.420 --> 03:02:16.420
Honestly, the best lie I ever told.

03:02:16.420 --> 03:02:19.420
I spent eight months in solitary confinement.

03:02:19.420 --> 03:02:21.420
OK, eight months.

03:02:21.420 --> 03:02:23.420
And that's an experience.

03:02:23.420 --> 03:02:27.420
Because you ain't got no books for the first month or so.

03:02:27.420 --> 03:02:29.420
Then they give you a King James Bible.

03:02:29.420 --> 03:02:30.420
Bible.

03:02:30.420 --> 03:02:31.420
Yeah.

03:02:31.420 --> 03:02:32.420
And then.

03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:34.420
For a month, no books.

03:02:34.420 --> 03:02:35.420
No books for a month.

03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:37.420
So this is a pretty small and.

03:02:37.420 --> 03:02:38.420
Six by nine room.

03:02:38.420 --> 03:02:39.420
Six by nine.

03:02:39.420 --> 03:02:40.420
Yeah.

03:02:40.420 --> 03:02:41.420
No books.

03:02:41.420 --> 03:02:42.420
No books.

03:02:42.420 --> 03:02:44.420
No books, no paper, no pen, no pencil.

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:45.420
You're alone with your mind.

03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:47.420
You got a mat, a toilet.

03:02:47.420 --> 03:02:49.420
What's that like?

03:02:49.420 --> 03:02:51.420
You sleep as much as you can.

03:02:51.420 --> 03:02:55.420
You're sleeping 16, 18 hours a day is what you're doing.

03:02:55.420 --> 03:03:01.420
What about when you're thinking about even just going back to like Elizabeth.

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:03.420
Oh, you go through all that.

03:03:03.420 --> 03:03:04.420
The whole thing.

03:03:04.420 --> 03:03:05.420
Every bit.

03:03:05.420 --> 03:03:06.420
Your mom too.

03:03:06.420 --> 03:03:07.420
Yeah.

03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:09.420
Going through every single bit of that.

03:03:09.420 --> 03:03:12.420
So you're supposed to get out an hour a day.

03:03:12.420 --> 03:03:15.420
Law says you're supposed to get out an hour a day.

03:03:15.420 --> 03:03:16.420
That's the law.

03:03:16.420 --> 03:03:18.420
That's not the way things actually happen.

03:03:18.420 --> 03:03:21.420
What actually happens is you're lucky to get out an hour a week.

03:03:21.420 --> 03:03:23.420
You take a shower twice a week.

03:03:23.420 --> 03:03:25.420
And that's that's it.

03:03:25.420 --> 03:03:26.420
You got a phone call once a month.

03:03:26.420 --> 03:03:28.420
Oh, so you don't get to see nature.

03:03:28.420 --> 03:03:29.420
Don't see anything.

03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:30.420
You get in solitary.

03:03:30.420 --> 03:03:31.420
All right.

03:03:31.420 --> 03:03:33.420
And it takes about a week.

03:03:33.420 --> 03:03:35.420
The first week is the roughest.

03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:38.420
You're bouncing off the walls at first week because you can't sleep.

03:03:38.420 --> 03:03:39.420
Can't do anything else.

03:03:39.420 --> 03:03:42.420
Then you start to adapt to it after a while.

03:03:42.420 --> 03:03:45.420
When that book does arrive, you're happy as hell to have it.

03:03:45.420 --> 03:03:48.420
I'm well versed in King James Bible.

03:03:48.420 --> 03:03:50.420
So you're happy to have it.

03:03:50.420 --> 03:03:54.420
Then finally, you get other books that come that come in from that point.

03:03:54.420 --> 03:03:56.420
Spent eight months of that.

03:03:56.420 --> 03:03:59.420
And they send me out to a real prison.

03:03:59.420 --> 03:04:01.420
Big Spring, Texas.

03:04:01.420 --> 03:04:02.420
West Texas.

03:04:02.420 --> 03:04:05.420
Where have you been out there?

03:04:05.420 --> 03:04:07.420
No, man.

03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:08.420
I could tell.

03:04:08.420 --> 03:04:10.420
Prairie dogs and tarantulas.

03:04:10.420 --> 03:04:11.420
Yeah, that's what it is.

03:04:11.420 --> 03:04:12.420
They got no kidding.

03:04:12.420 --> 03:04:17.420
It gets so hot that warnings come on the radio radio telling you not to drive on

03:04:17.420 --> 03:04:19.420
certain streets because they're melted.

03:04:19.420 --> 03:04:21.420
That's that's Big Spring.

03:04:21.420 --> 03:04:27.420
So if you've seen the movie from dusk till dawn, the opening scene is in Big

03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:28.420
Spring, Texas.

03:04:28.420 --> 03:04:30.420
That was hot.

03:04:30.420 --> 03:04:31.420
Very hot.

03:04:31.420 --> 03:04:34.420
So and that's where I find out what a real prison is.

03:04:34.420 --> 03:04:37.420
And it's not ran by guards.

03:04:37.420 --> 03:04:39.420
Prisons are ran by inmates.

03:04:39.420 --> 03:04:41.420
And that's a fact.

03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:47.420
So you're met at the door by whatever race you are is what happens.

03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:50.420
So Big Spring is a converted Air Force compound.

03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:51.420
It's a disciplinary prison.

03:04:51.420 --> 03:04:53.420
So you get the bad guys are in there.

03:04:53.420 --> 03:05:00.420
So I get I go through processing and I'm walking up to the unit and I met at the

03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:03.420
door by a guy named Nick Sandifer.

03:05:03.420 --> 03:05:05.420
He's the treasurer of the Aryan Brotherhood.

03:05:05.420 --> 03:05:10.420
And first question out of his mouth is any more white guys come in?

03:05:10.420 --> 03:05:11.420
And I didn't know.

03:05:11.420 --> 03:05:13.420
I was like, I don't know, four or five.

03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:16.420
Next question is, what are you in here for?

03:05:16.420 --> 03:05:18.420
My answer was because I got no worries.

03:05:18.420 --> 03:05:20.420
My answer was computer crime.

03:05:20.420 --> 03:05:21.420
Smiled at him.

03:05:21.420 --> 03:05:27.420
Turns out wrong thing to say because computer crime is not credit card theft or

03:05:27.420 --> 03:05:29.420
hacking or any bullshit like that.

03:05:29.420 --> 03:05:32.420
Computer crime in prison is child pornography.

03:05:32.420 --> 03:05:36.420
So tell him that he looks at me like I'm a piece of shit.

03:05:36.420 --> 03:05:38.420
Goes and gets his buddies.

03:05:38.420 --> 03:05:39.420
They circle around.

03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:41.420
What are you in here for?

03:05:41.420 --> 03:05:44.420
I like how the Aryan Brotherhood has like lines.

03:05:44.420 --> 03:05:47.420
They're like, oh yeah, this is child porn.

03:05:47.420 --> 03:05:48.420
That's it.

03:05:48.420 --> 03:05:49.420
That's the bad guy.

03:05:49.420 --> 03:05:50.420
They circle around.

03:05:50.420 --> 03:05:52.420
They're like, what did you say you're in here for?

03:05:52.420 --> 03:05:54.420
So I'm sitting there trying to explain it to them.

03:05:54.420 --> 03:05:56.420
They're like, you know, you tell a good story.

03:05:56.420 --> 03:05:58.420
You still said this.

03:05:58.420 --> 03:06:04.420
Computer crime basically really does mean usually child pornography.

03:06:04.420 --> 03:06:05.420
In prison, yeah.

03:06:05.420 --> 03:06:08.420
And what you see, and that's one of the things you find out, the guys that are

03:06:08.420 --> 03:06:12.420
going in there for child porn, they will tell them it's credit card theft.

03:06:12.420 --> 03:06:13.420
Right.

03:06:13.420 --> 03:06:14.420
So yeah.

03:06:14.420 --> 03:06:15.420
Right.

03:06:15.420 --> 03:06:16.420
They've learned.

03:06:16.420 --> 03:06:17.420
So I'm that guy.

03:06:17.420 --> 03:06:20.420
But you also don't, I mean, for people who are just listening to this, you

03:06:20.420 --> 03:06:24.420
don't exactly look like the typical computer hacker.

03:06:24.420 --> 03:06:25.420
That's true.

03:06:25.420 --> 03:06:26.420
That's true.

03:06:26.420 --> 03:06:27.420
That's very true.

03:06:27.420 --> 03:06:29.420
But I don't look like the pedophile either.

03:06:29.420 --> 03:06:30.420
That's right.

03:06:30.420 --> 03:06:31.420
That's right.

03:06:31.420 --> 03:06:34.420
But it's like, it doesn't make it seem like you're, I mean, I guess you're not

03:06:34.420 --> 03:06:40.420
wearing a hoodie and you're, you're not like emo dark, you know.

03:06:40.420 --> 03:06:46.420
The way it actually works in prison, they won't attack you until they know.

03:06:46.420 --> 03:06:47.420
All right.

03:06:47.420 --> 03:06:51.420
So they have to see paperwork, which now in federal prison, you don't get

03:06:51.420 --> 03:06:53.420
transported with paperwork because of that.

03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:58.420
So they have to see paperwork or a guard will tell them what you're in

03:06:58.420 --> 03:06:59.420
there for.

03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:02.420
Guards will tell who the pedophiles are.

03:07:02.420 --> 03:07:05.420
So none of the guards told them that was anything.

03:07:05.420 --> 03:07:09.420
So for the first month, they think I am, but they're not doing anything

03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:10.420
because they don't know for sure.

03:07:10.420 --> 03:07:14.420
At the end of the first month, I'd been talking to Kevin Poulsen over at

03:07:14.420 --> 03:07:16.420
Wired magazine about Max Butler.

03:07:16.420 --> 03:07:20.420
He does an article about that shows up in Wired magazine.

03:07:20.420 --> 03:07:23.420
So at the end of the first month, Wired magazine hits compound, front cover,

03:07:23.420 --> 03:07:24.420
all the story.

03:07:24.420 --> 03:07:26.420
You would think, you would think it saved me.

03:07:26.420 --> 03:07:28.420
So I'm reading the article really happy about it.

03:07:28.420 --> 03:07:31.420
So what happens is, is four o'clock is mail call.

03:07:31.420 --> 03:07:33.420
Four o'clock is a standup count nationwide.

03:07:33.420 --> 03:07:35.420
After four o'clock is your mail call.

03:07:35.420 --> 03:07:36.420
They hand out all the mail for the day.

03:07:36.420 --> 03:07:38.420
So the mail comes, I get the magazine.

03:07:38.420 --> 03:07:39.420
I'm like reading through it.

03:07:39.420 --> 03:07:40.420
I'm like, well, shit, I'm good to go.

03:07:40.420 --> 03:07:46.420
Then it says Brett Johnson, secret service informant in the article.

03:07:46.420 --> 03:07:48.420
So you're now a snitch.

03:07:48.420 --> 03:07:51.420
Which is right up there with the pedophiles.

03:07:51.420 --> 03:07:54.420
So we go to dinner after that.

03:07:54.420 --> 03:07:56.420
At dinner, you could hear it.

03:07:56.420 --> 03:07:57.420
You could hear the chat.

03:07:57.420 --> 03:07:58.420
We got a snitch.

03:07:58.420 --> 03:08:00.420
I think it's that guy over there.

03:08:00.420 --> 03:08:03.420
Warden next day shuts down the entire compound.

03:08:03.420 --> 03:08:05.420
Calls me into his office.

03:08:05.420 --> 03:08:06.420
They got security there.

03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:08.420
You got the counselors there and everything else.

03:08:08.420 --> 03:08:09.420
Warden looks at me.

03:08:09.420 --> 03:08:12.420
He's like, did you give an interview to Wired magazine?

03:08:12.420 --> 03:08:13.420
I'm like, yeah.

03:08:13.420 --> 03:08:16.420
He's like, do you not know they will kill you in here?

03:08:16.420 --> 03:08:21.420
I was like, he was like, do you feel safe?

03:08:21.420 --> 03:08:24.420
Well, I know if you tell me you don't feel safe, they transport you.

03:08:24.420 --> 03:08:28.420
Transport you means another eight months in solitary confinement.

03:08:28.420 --> 03:08:31.420
You start to see shit in solitary after a while.

03:08:31.420 --> 03:08:32.420
So I'm like, no, not going to do that.

03:08:32.420 --> 03:08:34.420
So I'm like, completely safe.

03:08:34.420 --> 03:08:39.420
He was like, look, he's like, if anybody says anything to you,

03:08:39.420 --> 03:08:44.420
immediately come to us because they'll fucking kill you.

03:08:44.420 --> 03:08:46.420
So they do a locker search, try to confiscate the magazines.

03:08:46.420 --> 03:08:47.420
They can't.

03:08:47.420 --> 03:08:49.420
The next day I walk into the unit.

03:08:49.420 --> 03:08:53.420
There's Nick Sandiford laying on his bunk, magazine wide open, reading it.

03:08:53.420 --> 03:08:55.420
I'm like, oh shit.

03:08:55.420 --> 03:08:56.420
Walked up to him.

03:08:56.420 --> 03:08:58.420
I was like, hey, Nick, what are you doing?

03:08:58.420 --> 03:08:59.420
He's like, oh, doing some reading.

03:08:59.420 --> 03:09:01.420
I was like, anything interesting?

03:09:01.420 --> 03:09:03.420
He's like, it's getting there.

03:09:03.420 --> 03:09:06.420
I was like, let me save you the trouble.

03:09:06.420 --> 03:09:08.420
Take the magazine, turn over the page.

03:09:08.420 --> 03:09:10.420
I was like, right there is what you're looking for.

03:09:10.420 --> 03:09:12.420
He was like, man, I already knew.

03:09:12.420 --> 03:09:15.420
I was like, do we have a problem?

03:09:15.420 --> 03:09:16.420
And he looks at me.

03:09:16.420 --> 03:09:19.420
He's like, is anyone on the compound you told on?

03:09:19.420 --> 03:09:20.420
I was like, no.

03:09:20.420 --> 03:09:25.420
He's like, until someone gets here you snitched on, we're OK.

03:09:25.420 --> 03:09:27.420
I was like, OK.

03:09:27.420 --> 03:09:31.420
He's like, but I need you to do something for me.

03:09:31.420 --> 03:09:32.420
All right.

03:09:32.420 --> 03:09:34.420
So in federal prison, you got to have a job.

03:09:34.420 --> 03:09:35.420
Everybody works.

03:09:35.420 --> 03:09:37.420
Doesn't matter what you do, but you got to work.

03:09:37.420 --> 03:09:41.420
I got a job in education teaching a lit class.

03:09:41.420 --> 03:09:44.420
Every Wednesday, 6 to 8, 30 PM, lit.

03:09:44.420 --> 03:09:49.420
And had every area on the compound signs up for the lit class.

03:09:49.420 --> 03:09:52.420
Had a couple of guards every now and then popped in.

03:09:52.420 --> 03:09:54.420
And did we teach lit?

03:09:54.420 --> 03:09:55.420
No.

03:09:55.420 --> 03:09:59.420
We taught fraud every Wednesday, 6 to 8, 30 PM.

03:09:59.420 --> 03:10:01.420
That's how I didn't get my ass beaten.

03:10:01.420 --> 03:10:04.420
And my other job, I had two jobs with them.

03:10:04.420 --> 03:10:06.420
The other job, you get to the point.

03:10:06.420 --> 03:10:07.420
It's weird, man.

03:10:07.420 --> 03:10:09.420
You get to the point.

03:10:09.420 --> 03:10:11.420
People walking off the bus.

03:10:11.420 --> 03:10:13.420
You know immediately two groups of people.

03:10:13.420 --> 03:10:16.420
You know who the bank robbers are immediately.

03:10:16.420 --> 03:10:18.420
Just by them walking off the bus, you're like,

03:10:18.420 --> 03:10:20.420
that motherfucker's a bank robber.

03:10:20.420 --> 03:10:23.420
And you know who the pedophiles are immediately.

03:10:23.420 --> 03:10:28.420
So my job as the white guy was to approach the white pedophiles

03:10:28.420 --> 03:10:29.420
and have a conversation.

03:10:29.420 --> 03:10:32.420
And the conversation was basically, hey,

03:10:32.420 --> 03:10:34.420
don't know what you're in here for.

03:10:34.420 --> 03:10:36.420
Don't care what you're in here for.

03:10:36.420 --> 03:10:40.420
But if you got some sort of fucked up charge,

03:10:40.420 --> 03:10:42.420
you need to tell me.

03:10:42.420 --> 03:10:45.420
If you tell me everything's going to be all right.

03:10:45.420 --> 03:10:49.420
If you don't tell me, you see those guys over there?

03:10:49.420 --> 03:10:52.420
If you start to associate with them or they start to talk to you

03:10:52.420 --> 03:10:55.420
and then they find out you're in here on something,

03:10:55.420 --> 03:10:57.420
they're going to kill you.

03:10:57.420 --> 03:10:59.420
And what are the things, pedophile?

03:10:59.420 --> 03:11:02.420
Pedophile, rapist, anything that harms children,

03:11:02.420 --> 03:11:04.420
harms women, anything like that.

03:11:04.420 --> 03:11:07.420
There are, it's like the mob, there's rules.

03:11:07.420 --> 03:11:10.420
There's an ethical code.

03:11:10.420 --> 03:11:14.420
Even if you have the division between races on all that,

03:11:14.420 --> 03:11:17.420
you still have these lines drawn.

03:11:17.420 --> 03:11:19.420
And there's a hierarchy too.

03:11:19.420 --> 03:11:20.420
Very, very much so.

03:11:20.420 --> 03:11:23.420
And what that looks like in prison, depending on the,

03:11:23.420 --> 03:11:25.420
it depends on the security class that you're in,

03:11:25.420 --> 03:11:27.420
what level prison.

03:11:27.420 --> 03:11:30.420
But at that prison, what that looked like was,

03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:32.420
you're not allowed to talk to anybody.

03:11:32.420 --> 03:11:34.420
You're not allowed to watch television.

03:11:34.420 --> 03:11:36.420
You can go to the library.

03:11:36.420 --> 03:11:39.420
You don't associate with anyone except your own type.

03:11:39.420 --> 03:11:43.420
If you do anything like this, we will kill you.

03:11:43.420 --> 03:11:48.420
If someone wants to extort you, we will do that too.

03:11:48.420 --> 03:11:51.420
And you won't tell on us or we'll kill you.

03:11:51.420 --> 03:11:54.420
So that's the way that works at that point.

03:11:54.420 --> 03:11:57.420
And everybody quickly learns this.

03:11:57.420 --> 03:11:59.420
Quickly, quickly.

03:11:59.420 --> 03:12:02.420
And so typically the guys would say,

03:12:02.420 --> 03:12:03.420
I just want to do my own time.

03:12:03.420 --> 03:12:04.420
That would be the line.

03:12:04.420 --> 03:12:07.420
And it's like, okay, don't mess with him.

03:12:07.420 --> 03:12:09.420
All right.

03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:11.420
Every now and then you'd have somebody lie.

03:12:11.420 --> 03:12:14.420
And that would come with those types of consequences.

03:12:14.420 --> 03:12:20.420
I got to see, while I was there, I saw two people murdered.

03:12:20.420 --> 03:12:22.420
Saw, went through three prison riots.

03:12:22.420 --> 03:12:26.420
And through my entire tenure in prison, saw four suicides.

03:12:26.420 --> 03:12:30.420
The people who got killed, it was, so we had outside,

03:12:30.420 --> 03:12:32.420
you had this track, a third of a mile track.

03:12:32.420 --> 03:12:34.420
You walk it counterclockwise.

03:12:34.420 --> 03:12:37.420
And inside of the track, you got two handball courts.

03:12:37.420 --> 03:12:41.420
So of an evening, it happened both times.

03:12:41.420 --> 03:12:44.420
All of us would be walking, you know, doing our exercises.

03:12:44.420 --> 03:12:47.420
And at the top of the key, like a flock of birds,

03:12:47.420 --> 03:12:51.420
you'd see all the inmates start to migrate down toward the gate.

03:12:51.420 --> 03:12:54.420
So the first time you see that, you see that migration.

03:12:54.420 --> 03:12:57.420
You look up in the distance and one of the inmates got another

03:12:57.420 --> 03:13:01.420
inmate down and he's just hammering his head right into the

03:13:01.420 --> 03:13:03.420
pavement like that right there.

03:13:03.420 --> 03:13:06.420
Well, guards don't stop that because a guard may get hurt.

03:13:06.420 --> 03:13:10.420
So a guard, it's 15 minutes coming out to stop that

03:13:10.420 --> 03:13:11.420
until everything's over.

03:13:11.420 --> 03:13:14.420
By that point, the guy doesn't have a head.

03:13:14.420 --> 03:13:16.420
They shut the compound down.

03:13:16.420 --> 03:13:17.420
And this is what happens.

03:13:17.420 --> 03:13:20.420
So you shut the entire compound down.

03:13:20.420 --> 03:13:22.420
They make two lines of the inmates.

03:13:22.420 --> 03:13:25.420
And what happens is the inmate walks into a room.

03:13:25.420 --> 03:13:27.420
They shut the door behind the inmate.

03:13:27.420 --> 03:13:28.420
Guard asks him two questions.

03:13:28.420 --> 03:13:30.420
First question is, did you see anything?

03:13:30.420 --> 03:13:31.420
The answer is no.

03:13:31.420 --> 03:13:33.420
Second question is, if you had seen anything,

03:13:33.420 --> 03:13:35.420
would you say anything?

03:13:35.420 --> 03:13:36.420
The answer is no.

03:13:36.420 --> 03:13:38.420
Guard then says, get the fuck out.

03:13:38.420 --> 03:13:39.420
And that's it.

03:13:39.420 --> 03:13:45.420
Anybody that stays in any longer than that is automatically suspect.

03:13:45.420 --> 03:13:49.420
So there was one instance, I remember this Hispanic guy,

03:13:49.420 --> 03:13:51.420
he's in there for a few minutes.

03:13:51.420 --> 03:13:56.420
And everybody's like, what's going on?

03:13:56.420 --> 03:14:01.420
So his people then call him over, explain to us what went on.

03:14:01.420 --> 03:14:03.420
And it happens like that.

03:14:03.420 --> 03:14:07.420
It's fascinating because you talked about the network of trust

03:14:07.420 --> 03:14:10.420
in the cyber crime community.

03:14:10.420 --> 03:14:15.420
And here's a network of trust in the prison crime community.

03:14:15.420 --> 03:14:17.420
Trust.

03:14:17.420 --> 03:14:18.420
Trust matters.

03:14:18.420 --> 03:14:20.420
Trust drives everything at the end of the day.

03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:24.420
The riots that I went through, the first riot, man,

03:14:24.420 --> 03:14:25.420
you're scared to death.

03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:27.420
Scared to death.

03:14:27.420 --> 03:14:30.420
You've got the cops dressed up in the Ninja Turtle outfits.

03:14:30.420 --> 03:14:34.420
You've got the rubber bullets, the tear gas canisters, all that crap.

03:14:34.420 --> 03:14:37.420
You've got the inmates that are raising hell.

03:14:37.420 --> 03:14:38.420
Scared to death.

03:14:38.420 --> 03:14:41.420
The second riot, you calm down.

03:14:41.420 --> 03:14:43.420
Second riot, you start to notice.

03:14:43.420 --> 03:14:45.420
This is a racial riot.

03:14:45.420 --> 03:14:50.420
This is typically, and almost always, it's Hispanics and African-Americans.

03:14:50.420 --> 03:14:54.420
So you get to detect what is the motivation for the riot,

03:14:54.420 --> 03:14:56.420
what is the reason, and that gives you some calm.

03:14:56.420 --> 03:14:57.420
That's exactly right.

03:14:57.420 --> 03:14:58.420
So the second riot, you start to notice this.

03:14:58.420 --> 03:15:00.420
Hey, man, this ain't me.

03:15:00.420 --> 03:15:02.420
This ain't our group.

03:15:02.420 --> 03:15:03.420
Third riot, no shit.

03:15:03.420 --> 03:15:07.420
Third riot, you lay in your bunk.

03:15:07.420 --> 03:15:10.420
You let them wage war all around you.

03:15:10.420 --> 03:15:12.420
And every now and then you have an inmate that will run up to you

03:15:12.420 --> 03:15:14.420
and they'll point to a locker and say, is that your locker?

03:15:14.420 --> 03:15:16.420
And if you tell them yes, they leave it alone.

03:15:16.420 --> 03:15:18.420
If you say it's not my locker, they'll break into it

03:15:18.420 --> 03:15:21.420
and steal everything out of it and go from there.

03:15:21.420 --> 03:15:23.420
And that's what happens.

03:15:23.420 --> 03:15:25.420
So you did your time for five years.

03:15:25.420 --> 03:15:26.420
Five and a half.

03:15:26.420 --> 03:15:27.420
Five and a half.

03:15:27.420 --> 03:15:28.420
You made it out.

03:15:28.420 --> 03:15:29.420
Made it out.

03:15:29.420 --> 03:15:32.420
I went through, I told you it was a good lie that I told.

03:15:32.420 --> 03:15:35.420
I went through the residential drug abuse program.

03:15:35.420 --> 03:15:37.420
It's a nine-month intensive therapy.

03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:41.420
And the way I got to that, this counselor at Big Spring,

03:15:41.420 --> 03:15:44.420
he bought this.

03:15:44.420 --> 03:15:46.420
He wanted inmates to be educated.

03:15:46.420 --> 03:15:47.420
He was a really good guy.

03:15:47.420 --> 03:15:49.420
So he wanted inmates to be educated.

03:15:49.420 --> 03:15:54.420
He got a discount on a game theory class set.

03:15:54.420 --> 03:15:57.420
So he gets all these discs and everything and he's asking,

03:15:57.420 --> 03:16:00.420
does anybody on the compound know anything about game theory?

03:16:00.420 --> 03:16:04.420
And somebody says, if anybody does, it'll be Brett Johnson.

03:16:04.420 --> 03:16:07.420
So he comes up to me one day and my buggy is like,

03:16:07.420 --> 03:16:08.420
are you Brett Johnson?

03:16:08.420 --> 03:16:09.420
I was like, yeah.

03:16:09.420 --> 03:16:12.420
He was like, do you know anything about game theory?

03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:14.420
And I was like, yes, I do.

03:16:14.420 --> 03:16:17.420
So I start rattling off prisoner's dilemma and everything else.

03:16:17.420 --> 03:16:19.420
He's like, will you teach a class?

03:16:19.420 --> 03:16:20.420
So I start teaching that.

03:16:20.420 --> 03:16:26.420
I start teaching inmates public speaking and to make friends with this counselor.

03:16:26.420 --> 03:16:30.420
So it gets time where I'm supposed to be transferring out to this drug program

03:16:30.420 --> 03:16:32.420
that they only had in Fort Worth.

03:16:32.420 --> 03:16:35.420
And the transfers are taking like four or five months.

03:16:35.420 --> 03:16:38.420
And that's four or five months I could be out free.

03:16:38.420 --> 03:16:41.420
So I went up to him one day and I was like, look, his name was Keely.

03:16:41.420 --> 03:16:46.420
I was like, look, man, I said, is there any way that I can get transferred out any sooner?

03:16:46.420 --> 03:16:50.420
And he looks at me and he's like, Brett, I cannot help you.

03:16:50.420 --> 03:16:51.420
And I was like, I appreciate that.

03:16:51.420 --> 03:16:53.420
Thank you so much for even trying.

03:16:53.420 --> 03:16:58.420
So he said that a week later, I'm on a bus by going to Fort Worth.

03:16:58.420 --> 03:16:59.420
So he got to Fort Worth.

03:16:59.420 --> 03:17:00.420
I got it.

03:17:00.420 --> 03:17:01.420
Yeah.

03:17:01.420 --> 03:17:02.420
I love it.

03:17:02.420 --> 03:17:06.420
So it was a nine month program, 24 hours a day of cognitive behavioral therapy.

03:17:06.420 --> 03:17:07.420
It had nothing to do with drugs.

03:17:07.420 --> 03:17:11.420
It was all pure, pure study stuff and CBT training.

03:17:11.420 --> 03:17:15.420
And honestly, it's the best thing that could ever happen.

03:17:15.420 --> 03:17:17.420
Truly is that part.

03:17:17.420 --> 03:17:18.420
What is it?

03:17:18.420 --> 03:17:21.420
What was the thing that changed you as a man?

03:17:21.420 --> 03:17:23.420
Is it the solitary confinement?

03:17:23.420 --> 03:17:24.420
Was it the years?

03:17:24.420 --> 03:17:28.420
Was it losing the people you loved?

03:17:28.420 --> 03:17:30.420
Or was it that behavioral therapy?

03:17:30.420 --> 03:17:31.420
It's a combination, man.

03:17:31.420 --> 03:17:32.420
It's a combination.

03:17:32.420 --> 03:17:34.420
It was.

03:17:34.420 --> 03:17:36.420
So my sister disowns me.

03:17:36.420 --> 03:17:37.420
The only person I had in my life.

03:17:37.420 --> 03:17:40.420
I mean, me and my sister, that's it.

03:17:40.420 --> 03:17:42.420
I mean, I loved Elizabeth.

03:17:42.420 --> 03:17:43.420
I love my wife now.

03:17:43.420 --> 03:17:46.420
But it's me and my sister.

03:17:46.420 --> 03:17:48.420
We went through all that shit together.

03:17:48.420 --> 03:17:49.420
So Denise disowns me.

03:17:49.420 --> 03:17:54.420
She doesn't talk to me for an entire year when all this stuff happens.

03:17:54.420 --> 03:18:02.420
And after I get arrested on the escape, she ends up driving seven hours to come see me to tell me she loves me.

03:18:02.420 --> 03:18:04.420
And I don't see her again for five and a half years.

03:18:04.420 --> 03:18:05.420
Yeah.

03:18:05.420 --> 03:18:07.420
So that's really the first turnaround.

03:18:07.420 --> 03:18:12.420
It took me two and a half years in prison to accept responsibility.

03:18:12.420 --> 03:18:14.420
That was amazing that she did that.

03:18:14.420 --> 03:18:15.420
Yeah.

03:18:15.420 --> 03:18:16.420
She drove down.

03:18:16.420 --> 03:18:17.420
Yeah.

03:18:17.420 --> 03:18:18.420
She did that.

03:18:18.420 --> 03:18:19.420
Yeah, she's something.

03:18:19.420 --> 03:18:20.420
She's something.

03:18:20.420 --> 03:18:23.420
Yeah, she saw me for 10 minutes, tell me she loves me, and then I don't see her again.

03:18:23.420 --> 03:18:25.420
She planted the seed.

03:18:25.420 --> 03:18:29.420
But yeah, you had time to think over those years.

03:18:29.420 --> 03:18:35.420
Two and a half years to realize that I didn't commit crime because of stripper girlfriends or wives or family.

03:18:35.420 --> 03:18:37.420
I committed it because I wanted to, chose to.

03:18:37.420 --> 03:18:41.420
And that's the first turnaround.

03:18:41.420 --> 03:18:44.420
Second turnaround is the CBT training.

03:18:44.420 --> 03:18:49.420
It didn't really hit while I was in prison.

03:18:49.420 --> 03:18:52.420
I went through it and they ingrained it in you.

03:18:52.420 --> 03:18:56.420
But until you choose to make it work, it doesn't work.

03:18:56.420 --> 03:18:58.420
So I got out in 2011.

03:18:58.420 --> 03:19:00.420
Didn't want to break the law, did not.

03:19:00.420 --> 03:19:02.420
And I was under three years probation.

03:19:02.420 --> 03:19:04.420
Couldn't touch the computer.

03:19:04.420 --> 03:19:11.420
I had a job offer from Deloitte to run a cybercrime office in the UK, which that was a no.

03:19:11.420 --> 03:19:14.420
No, you're not moving and that's a computer idiot.

03:19:14.420 --> 03:19:19.420
Then I had a job offer from Know Before, a fishing company.

03:19:19.420 --> 03:19:20.420
Couldn't take that.

03:19:20.420 --> 03:19:23.420
Got to where I was trying to apply for fast food jobs.

03:19:23.420 --> 03:19:24.420
That's a computer.

03:19:24.420 --> 03:19:26.420
Can't touch that.

03:19:26.420 --> 03:19:27.420
Okay.

03:19:27.420 --> 03:19:28.420
Then what about a waiter's position?

03:19:28.420 --> 03:19:31.420
Well, that's a computer and access to credit cards, idiot.

03:19:31.420 --> 03:19:33.420
Can't touch that either.

03:19:33.420 --> 03:19:35.420
So literally could not get a job.

03:19:35.420 --> 03:19:37.420
Could not.

03:19:37.420 --> 03:19:39.420
Doing food stamps.

03:19:39.420 --> 03:19:42.420
I had a roommate that paid half the rent.

03:19:42.420 --> 03:19:47.420
They tell you when you leave prison to get a job and something you care about and you won't recidivate.

03:19:47.420 --> 03:19:51.420
Couldn't get a job and what I had was a cat.

03:19:51.420 --> 03:19:53.420
Monster the Cat.

03:19:53.420 --> 03:19:55.420
That was the cat's name.

03:19:55.420 --> 03:19:56.420
That's a good name.

03:19:56.420 --> 03:20:02.420
Yeah, I had enough money to feed that little guy and didn't have money to buy toilet paper for the apartment.

03:20:02.420 --> 03:20:04.420
So I was on Panama City Beach.

03:20:04.420 --> 03:20:06.420
How long were you living like this?

03:20:06.420 --> 03:20:10.420
It was a steady decline because remember I taught my dad how to commit tax fraud.

03:20:10.420 --> 03:20:13.420
So he bankrolled a lot of that until he couldn't.

03:20:13.420 --> 03:20:17.420
And then from there it's like, what the fuck do you do?

03:20:17.420 --> 03:20:24.420
So I didn't want to go into computer crime at all and I ended up shoplifting toilet paper, man.

03:20:24.420 --> 03:20:26.420
Shoplifting toilet paper.

03:20:26.420 --> 03:20:28.420
Just like for the basics.

03:20:28.420 --> 03:20:30.420
The basics of survival.

03:20:30.420 --> 03:20:37.420
So about the same time I had a friend that, this guy, I'd been dating the same type of women I had been dating.

03:20:37.420 --> 03:20:39.420
You know, these unhealthy ones.

03:20:39.420 --> 03:20:41.420
The hot unhealthy ones.

03:20:41.420 --> 03:20:42.420
Yes.

03:20:42.420 --> 03:20:43.420
Love.

03:20:43.420 --> 03:20:44.420
That's how that works.

03:20:44.420 --> 03:20:50.420
So I had a friend post an ad for me on Plenty of Fish and this woman responds.

03:20:50.420 --> 03:20:51.420
My wife.

03:20:51.420 --> 03:20:52.420
She responds.

03:20:52.420 --> 03:20:53.420
She responds.

03:20:53.420 --> 03:20:56.420
And the pictures I had taken were these prison type pictures.

03:20:56.420 --> 03:20:58.420
You know, the serious like, they were there.

03:20:58.420 --> 03:21:01.420
She sends me a message of, why aren't you smiling?

03:21:01.420 --> 03:21:03.420
And my response was, that is my happy face.

03:21:03.420 --> 03:21:08.420
So we started talking and we started dating.

03:21:08.420 --> 03:21:12.420
And she ends up, she's that second saving thing, man.

03:21:12.420 --> 03:21:14.420
She, I ended up moving in with her.

03:21:14.420 --> 03:21:15.420
I was going broke.

03:21:15.420 --> 03:21:17.420
I was about to get kicked out of the apartment and everything else.

03:21:17.420 --> 03:21:19.420
And she didn't say it, but I think she knew it.

03:21:19.420 --> 03:21:27.420
And moved in with her and I got a job.

03:21:27.420 --> 03:21:31.420
And the job I got, my probation officer let me have a cell phone.

03:21:31.420 --> 03:21:32.420
I was going through Craig's List.

03:21:32.420 --> 03:21:34.420
This guy was advertising for landscaping.

03:21:34.420 --> 03:21:35.420
Called him up.

03:21:35.420 --> 03:21:37.420
His name was Dustin DeRamos.

03:21:37.420 --> 03:21:39.420
Called him up and he was like, come on down and talk to me.

03:21:39.420 --> 03:21:43.420
So he was running this business, him and his brother were, out of his house.

03:21:43.420 --> 03:21:45.420
So I'm sitting there talking to him for about 20 minutes.

03:21:45.420 --> 03:21:46.420
He looks at me.

03:21:46.420 --> 03:21:47.420
He's like, can I ask you a question?

03:21:47.420 --> 03:21:48.420
I was like, yeah.

03:21:48.420 --> 03:21:50.420
He was like, are you on the run or something?

03:21:50.420 --> 03:21:53.420
So I'm like, no, why?

03:21:53.420 --> 03:21:56.420
And he was like, well, you just don't look like the kind of guy that do this.

03:21:56.420 --> 03:21:59.420
So I told him, I was like, this is who I am.

03:21:59.420 --> 03:22:00.420
This is what I've done.

03:22:00.420 --> 03:22:02.420
And he looks at me.

03:22:02.420 --> 03:22:04.420
He's like, man, I got to think about that.

03:22:04.420 --> 03:22:07.420
So he, he tells me to go on home.

03:22:07.420 --> 03:22:09.420
That was a Friday, Sunday evening.

03:22:09.420 --> 03:22:12.420
He gives me a call and he was like, Brett.

03:22:12.420 --> 03:22:16.420
He's like, if I hire you, will you actually work?

03:22:16.420 --> 03:22:19.420
And I told him, I was like, Dustin, if you'll give me a job, I promise.

03:22:19.420 --> 03:22:21.420
I'll work my ass off.

03:22:21.420 --> 03:22:23.420
And he's like, show up six o'clock.

03:22:23.420 --> 03:22:24.420
I was like, all right.

03:22:24.420 --> 03:22:30.420
So my job was to push a lawnmower 10 hours a day, five days a week for $400 a week

03:22:30.420 --> 03:22:32.420
and busted my ass.

03:22:32.420 --> 03:22:33.420
I hit it so hard.

03:22:33.420 --> 03:22:40.420
I would, I had come in of a night and pass out, wake up the next morning and hit it

03:22:40.420 --> 03:22:41.420
again.

03:22:41.420 --> 03:22:49.420
And it got to the point he ended up, this dude ended up offering me to come in a

03:22:49.420 --> 03:22:50.420
partner with his business.

03:22:50.420 --> 03:22:54.420
His brother dropped out and he, by that point I had learned everything on the

03:22:54.420 --> 03:22:55.420
business and everything.

03:22:55.420 --> 03:22:59.420
And he was like, you know, if you'd like to come in, I'll cut you in half.

03:22:59.420 --> 03:23:03.420
And I was like, Dustin, I can't do it, man, because I wasn't making any money.

03:23:03.420 --> 03:23:06.420
He didn't want to pay me anymore until, you know, he was able to do more.

03:23:06.420 --> 03:23:12.420
And I thought I found another job doing something else.

03:23:12.420 --> 03:23:15.420
And in a speech, I say it got cold and the grass started to stop growing.

03:23:15.420 --> 03:23:18.420
The truth of the matter was, is I thought I found another job.

03:23:18.420 --> 03:23:25.420
Guy was offering to pay me $1,500 a week doing the sales for oil rig training was

03:23:25.420 --> 03:23:26.420
what it was.

03:23:26.420 --> 03:23:28.420
And I accepted the job.

03:23:28.420 --> 03:23:35.420
I quit working for Dustin and the guy, I told him before he even offered me the

03:23:35.420 --> 03:23:39.420
job, I told him my criminal history because I was required to do that.

03:23:39.420 --> 03:23:41.420
So I was supposed to start work.

03:23:41.420 --> 03:23:43.420
Well, he calls me and tells me he can't hire me.

03:23:43.420 --> 03:23:45.420
So I'm out of work.

03:23:45.420 --> 03:23:49.420
And Dustin's already hired somebody else by that point, so I can't go back with

03:23:49.420 --> 03:23:50.420
him.

03:23:50.420 --> 03:23:53.420
And I'm that guy again, man.

03:23:53.420 --> 03:23:59.420
It's important for me to to show value in a relationship.

03:23:59.420 --> 03:24:00.420
All right.

03:24:00.420 --> 03:24:04.420
So Michelle was only one working.

03:24:04.420 --> 03:24:07.420
I'm like, I got to do something.

03:24:07.420 --> 03:24:09.420
And I get it in my head.

03:24:09.420 --> 03:24:13.420
I was like, you know, if nothing else, I can just bring food in the house.

03:24:13.420 --> 03:24:15.420
She was only making that.

03:24:15.420 --> 03:24:17.420
I think she was.

03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:19.420
I mean, we were headed hard.

03:24:19.420 --> 03:24:21.420
You know, it was just her her working.

03:24:21.420 --> 03:24:27.420
And I was like, nothing else, I bring food in the house and get on the dark web,

03:24:27.420 --> 03:24:31.420
get some stolen credit cards, start ordering food.

03:24:31.420 --> 03:24:33.420
Well, it gets worse than that.

03:24:33.420 --> 03:24:36.420
You know, she's got two sons there.

03:24:36.420 --> 03:24:38.420
So I'm like, well, they need clothes.

03:24:38.420 --> 03:24:42.420
So he started stealing clothes and it continues like that.

03:24:42.420 --> 03:24:43.420
I get arrested.

03:24:43.420 --> 03:24:46.420
I get arrested on a food order.

03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:50.420
And Michelle didn't know what I was doing.

03:24:51.420 --> 03:24:54.420
So she had been to work and she was coming back from work.

03:24:54.420 --> 03:24:57.420
I get arrested and I'm like, they let me make a phone call.

03:24:57.420 --> 03:24:59.420
And I call her and I say, come to the police station.

03:24:59.420 --> 03:25:01.420
I've been arrested.

03:25:01.420 --> 03:25:05.420
And she shows up and she didn't know I've been doing that.

03:25:05.420 --> 03:25:10.420
My probation officer, of course, he didn't know or anything else.

03:25:10.420 --> 03:25:16.420
At my sentencing for that, probation officer was there, prosecutor, the judge,

03:25:17.420 --> 03:25:20.420
US Marshals, Michelle and me.

03:25:20.420 --> 03:25:24.420
Michelle stands up and she tells the judge that I'm a better dad to her kids

03:25:24.420 --> 03:25:26.420
than their actual father is.

03:25:26.420 --> 03:25:32.420
And by that point, I'm crying.

03:25:32.420 --> 03:25:38.420
Probation officer stands up and he was like, we think Mr. Johnson's a good guy.

03:25:38.420 --> 03:25:40.420
We think this is a one time thing.

03:25:40.420 --> 03:25:42.420
Prosecutor says the same thing.

03:25:43.420 --> 03:25:46.420
Judge sentences me to one year.

03:25:46.420 --> 03:25:51.420
Probation officer stands back up and he was like, Mr. Johnson,

03:25:51.420 --> 03:25:56.420
Judge, if you can give Mr. Johnson a year and a day, he can get the good time

03:25:56.420 --> 03:25:59.420
and get back to his family center.

03:25:59.420 --> 03:26:01.420
So the judge amends the sentence to a year and a day.

03:26:01.420 --> 03:26:02.420
So I served 10 months.

03:26:02.420 --> 03:26:04.420
They sent me back to Texas.

03:26:04.420 --> 03:26:09.420
And that's when I find out that Michelle didn't need me for what I could give her.

03:26:09.420 --> 03:26:11.420
She just wanted me for me that entire time.

03:26:11.420 --> 03:26:14.420
She stands by me the entire time.

03:26:14.420 --> 03:26:16.420
I do my 10 months, get out.

03:26:16.420 --> 03:26:19.420
We get married after that and they kill probation.

03:26:19.420 --> 03:26:24.420
So I can touch a computer and they tell you, they're like, you know, inmates,

03:26:24.420 --> 03:26:27.420
a felon, if nothing else, he can sell cars.

03:26:27.420 --> 03:26:29.420
Well, it turns out you can't.

03:26:29.420 --> 03:26:31.420
You can sell cars if you're a drug dealer.

03:26:31.420 --> 03:26:34.420
If you're the guy that steals all the money and people's information, no,

03:26:34.420 --> 03:26:37.420
fuck no, you can't get a job selling cars.

03:26:37.420 --> 03:26:39.420
So you can't get a job.

03:26:39.420 --> 03:26:40.420
Cannot.

03:26:40.420 --> 03:26:44.420
And to this day, Lex, I know what my what my triggers are.

03:26:44.420 --> 03:26:47.420
I know what it would take to get me back into committing crime.

03:26:47.420 --> 03:26:49.420
And I knew I'd go so far at that point.

03:26:49.420 --> 03:26:52.420
So I looked at Michelle and I was like, let me see what I can do.

03:26:52.420 --> 03:26:57.420
Signed on to LinkedIn, reached out to this FBI supercop named Keith Malarski

03:26:57.420 --> 03:26:58.420
out of the Pittsburgh office.

03:26:58.420 --> 03:27:02.420
He was involved with my arrest and some associates and everything else

03:27:02.420 --> 03:27:04.420
and sent him a message.

03:27:04.420 --> 03:27:07.420
And the message was, you know, hey, I respect everything you did.

03:27:07.420 --> 03:27:09.420
Think you did a great job.

03:27:09.420 --> 03:27:12.420
By the way, I'd like to be legal.

03:27:12.420 --> 03:27:16.420
And dude responded within two hours, two hours.

03:27:16.420 --> 03:27:21.420
He gives me references, advice, takes me in under his wing, everything else

03:27:21.420 --> 03:27:22.420
like that.

03:27:22.420 --> 03:27:25.420
And from that point, man, it was the head of the identity theft council

03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:28.420
did the same thing.

03:27:28.420 --> 03:27:31.420
Cardinal present group hires me to speak.

03:27:31.420 --> 03:27:34.420
Microsoft hires me to consult with them.

03:27:34.420 --> 03:27:39.420
And the Microsoft hire established enough trust in the industry that I was

03:27:39.420 --> 03:27:42.420
all right from that point.

03:27:42.420 --> 03:27:48.420
So now you're helping in many ways fight the very guy that you used to be.

03:27:48.420 --> 03:27:52.420
So big picture advice.

03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:57.420
What given that you were that guy, how do we fight cybercrime today?

03:27:57.420 --> 03:28:02.420
And then the next five years, 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, what advice do you

03:28:02.420 --> 03:28:07.420
have to individuals, to companies, to governments of what?

03:28:07.420 --> 03:28:20.420
And also to Elizabeth, like the humans, human beings that love, that live, that

03:28:20.420 --> 03:28:23.420
are friends with cyber criminals.

03:28:23.420 --> 03:28:29.420
There's so many lessons to really be had from that.

03:28:29.420 --> 03:28:38.420
To me, one of the big lessons to me is you can't serve two masters.

03:28:38.420 --> 03:28:43.420
If you're that guy that is committing crime or that person that's addicted or

03:28:43.420 --> 03:28:49.420
you're in love with somebody that's addicted or has that, they don't love you.

03:28:49.420 --> 03:28:51.420
They love that addiction that comes first.

03:28:51.420 --> 03:28:53.420
It's always going to come first.

03:28:53.420 --> 03:28:54.420
So you have to realize that.

03:28:54.420 --> 03:29:03.420
You have to know when to cut somebody off, when to end something, knowing that

03:29:03.420 --> 03:29:07.420
they're not going to change until they decide to change.

03:29:07.420 --> 03:29:11.420
At the same time, you got to realize that the only reason I was able to turn my

03:29:11.420 --> 03:29:15.420
life around is because people took that chance on me.

03:29:15.420 --> 03:29:17.420
That's really the only reason.

03:29:17.420 --> 03:29:19.420
They believe that there's a good person in there.

03:29:19.420 --> 03:29:20.420
Yeah.

03:29:20.420 --> 03:29:25.420
If Malarski hadn't responded, if I hadn't had my sister, my wife, these companies

03:29:25.420 --> 03:29:29.420
that initially gave me that chance, my ass would be back in prison for 20 years.

03:29:29.420 --> 03:29:32.420
I have no doubt about that at all.

03:29:32.420 --> 03:29:34.420
So you have to realize that.

03:29:34.420 --> 03:29:39.420
Cybercrime, a lot of companies that I talk to, they don't really understand or

03:29:39.420 --> 03:29:46.420
appreciate that networking aspect, that trust aspect of how criminals establish

03:29:46.420 --> 03:29:49.420
trust with each other, how they work together.

03:29:49.420 --> 03:29:53.420
A lot of companies think that it's a single player that's out victimizing them.

03:29:53.420 --> 03:29:57.420
And when you really break down how cybercrime operates, that you've got a group

03:29:57.420 --> 03:30:01.420
of individuals that are working together to hit you, but not only hit you, but

03:30:01.420 --> 03:30:03.420
they share and exchange information freely.

03:30:03.420 --> 03:30:05.420
Companies don't do that.

03:30:05.420 --> 03:30:06.420
You've got privacy concerns.

03:30:06.420 --> 03:30:08.420
You've got competitive edge concerns, everything else.

03:30:08.420 --> 03:30:11.420
Companies don't share information across the board like criminals do.

03:30:11.420 --> 03:30:13.420
Criminals do that.

03:30:13.420 --> 03:30:14.420
You have to appreciate that.

03:30:14.420 --> 03:30:19.420
You have to understand that big statistic that 90% of their attacks use known

03:30:19.420 --> 03:30:20.420
exploits.

03:30:20.420 --> 03:30:21.420
It's not the stuff we don't know about.

03:30:21.420 --> 03:30:23.420
It's the shit we do know about.

03:30:23.420 --> 03:30:24.420
We're not doing anything about.

03:30:24.420 --> 03:30:28.420
So the way to defend against cybercrime is like there's a lot of low-hanging fruit

03:30:28.420 --> 03:30:29.420
they should fix.

03:30:29.420 --> 03:30:30.420
A lot of that.

03:30:30.420 --> 03:30:31.420
A lot of that.

03:30:31.420 --> 03:30:34.420
So a lot of basic stuff that's already vulnerabilities, update the system,

03:30:34.420 --> 03:30:35.420
security.

03:30:35.420 --> 03:30:39.420
Now, that doesn't take care of SolarWinds or CNAP or anything like that.

03:30:39.420 --> 03:30:41.420
It doesn't.

03:30:41.420 --> 03:30:46.420
But those instances, I mean, okay, that's a big instance.

03:30:46.420 --> 03:30:47.420
I mean, it is.

03:30:47.420 --> 03:30:55.420
But in the full spectrum of, especially in the future, because there's more and more

03:30:55.420 --> 03:30:57.420
companies that are coming online.

03:30:57.420 --> 03:30:58.420
They're becoming digital.

03:30:58.420 --> 03:31:01.420
And it's just more and more and more.

03:31:01.420 --> 03:31:05.420
And those vulnerabilities in terms of human nature, for social engineering and the

03:31:05.420 --> 03:31:08.420
actual outdated systems, all of it.

03:31:08.420 --> 03:31:12.420
Some of it, I guess, is, I mean, you're exceptionally good at this, is educating

03:31:12.420 --> 03:31:13.420
on the social engineering side.

03:31:13.420 --> 03:31:14.420
Right.

03:31:14.420 --> 03:31:16.420
Is educating people and companies that...

03:31:16.420 --> 03:31:17.420
You've got to do that.

03:31:17.420 --> 03:31:22.420
And companies have to, you know, I made that point that they never report to law

03:31:22.420 --> 03:31:23.420
enforcement.

03:31:23.420 --> 03:31:24.420
That's companies and individuals.

03:31:24.420 --> 03:31:30.420
You know, I've worked with Fortune 50 companies that will not press charges.

03:31:30.420 --> 03:31:35.420
Instead, they'll have that insider or that criminal sign an NDA.

03:31:35.420 --> 03:31:36.420
They'll pay them off.

03:31:36.420 --> 03:31:39.420
And we won't mention this shit anymore.

03:31:39.420 --> 03:31:41.420
You have to press charges.

03:31:41.420 --> 03:31:42.420
You have to report.

03:31:42.420 --> 03:31:45.420
You have to raise the awareness of everyone in the group.

03:31:45.420 --> 03:31:46.420
You have to be...

03:31:46.420 --> 03:31:51.420
It's that idea, and I've talked about that before, of understanding your place in that

03:31:51.420 --> 03:31:52.420
cybercrime spectrum.

03:31:52.420 --> 03:31:57.420
The way a criminal will victimize you depends on who you are and what you do as a person

03:31:57.420 --> 03:31:59.420
and as a business.

03:31:59.420 --> 03:32:01.420
So you have to understand that, design security around that.

03:32:01.420 --> 03:32:04.420
You know, we've got 7,500 security companies out there.

03:32:04.420 --> 03:32:06.420
A whole lot of them are snake oil salesmen.

03:32:06.420 --> 03:32:11.420
A lot of them is going to tell you that we're the one-stop solution, but you're not.

03:32:11.420 --> 03:32:12.420
You're not.

03:32:12.420 --> 03:32:14.420
You're a tool, all right?

03:32:14.420 --> 03:32:19.420
And you may have a very good tool, but it's not the only tool that's needed to protect

03:32:19.420 --> 03:32:21.420
against the attacks that are out there.

03:32:21.420 --> 03:32:24.420
And we have to be open and honest about that kind of stuff if we're not.

03:32:24.420 --> 03:32:28.420
So I guess defending defense is not just like one tool.

03:32:29.420 --> 03:32:35.420
It's a process of just like a diversity and just constantly educating people.

03:32:35.420 --> 03:32:36.420
Absolutely.

03:32:36.420 --> 03:32:38.420
So it's the social side.

03:32:38.420 --> 03:32:39.420
It's constantly...

03:32:39.420 --> 03:32:43.420
Because there's so many probably attack vectors in terms of the software that you have.

03:32:43.420 --> 03:32:47.420
If you look at it, that attack surface, you can't plug everything.

03:32:47.420 --> 03:32:49.420
It's too damn large to plug everything.

03:32:49.420 --> 03:32:54.420
But you can do the best job you can possibly do, but it takes a variety of tools to do

03:32:54.420 --> 03:32:55.420
that, all right?

03:32:55.420 --> 03:32:56.420
The idea...

03:32:56.420 --> 03:32:58.420
And Arcos is big about that.

03:32:58.420 --> 03:33:06.420
But the idea is to take the cost of fraud to the fraudster so high that they basically

03:33:06.420 --> 03:33:08.420
try to pick another target, all right?

03:33:08.420 --> 03:33:09.420
And that's the idea that you want.

03:33:09.420 --> 03:33:14.420
You want it to be not worth the criminal's time to hit your company.

03:33:14.420 --> 03:33:16.420
What about white hacking?

03:33:16.420 --> 03:33:26.420
So like hacking for good, sort of testing systems and then giving companies the vulnerabilities

03:33:26.420 --> 03:33:27.420
as you find them.

03:33:27.420 --> 03:33:28.420
I think it's outstanding.

03:33:28.420 --> 03:33:29.420
I do.

03:33:29.420 --> 03:33:31.420
I think pen testing, white hat stuff is outstanding.

03:33:31.420 --> 03:33:32.420
I truly do.

03:33:32.420 --> 03:33:35.420
I think that you have to.

03:33:35.420 --> 03:33:41.420
It has to be tempered with what is reality as well, though, all right?

03:33:41.420 --> 03:33:47.420
We've got a whole industry of people who try to sell RFID wallets that I don't know of

03:33:47.420 --> 03:33:50.420
many RFID hackers out there on the criminal side, to be honest with you.

03:33:50.420 --> 03:33:57.420
Yeah, so some of it is just like a psychological safety blanket that's not actually providing

03:33:57.420 --> 03:33:58.420
any protection.

03:33:58.420 --> 03:34:04.420
By the way, you wrote on LinkedIn something about ID me.

03:34:04.420 --> 03:34:05.420
What is it?

03:34:05.420 --> 03:34:06.420
Why is it a problem?

03:34:06.420 --> 03:34:08.420
I was going down a rabbit hole with you.

03:34:08.420 --> 03:34:10.420
I was wondering if you were going to mention them.

03:34:10.420 --> 03:34:15.420
You know, they lost, I guess I was partially responsible for them losing an $86 million

03:34:15.420 --> 03:34:16.420
contract.

03:34:16.420 --> 03:34:18.420
What was the contract with?

03:34:18.420 --> 03:34:20.420
With the IRS.

03:34:20.420 --> 03:34:22.420
So what is it?

03:34:22.420 --> 03:34:25.420
So ID me is an identity, okay, backtrack.

03:34:25.420 --> 03:34:30.420
ID me is a marketing company that wants to say they're an identity verification company.

03:34:30.420 --> 03:34:32.420
I just want to bring this up to see you get angry.

03:34:32.420 --> 03:34:36.420
I'll tell you what my issue is.

03:34:36.420 --> 03:34:37.420
My issue is.

03:34:37.420 --> 03:34:43.420
So it's a company that's used for authentication by the IRS, I guess.

03:34:43.420 --> 03:34:50.420
IRS, Social Security Administration, VA, at one point 23 state unemployment offices,

03:34:50.420 --> 03:34:51.420
a few other services.

03:34:51.420 --> 03:34:59.420
So I guess the idea is that you would be able to unlock your account or get, you know, authenticate

03:34:59.420 --> 03:35:05.420
yourself as a human being by using your face or something like that, or private information.

03:35:05.420 --> 03:35:08.420
They've got a tiered system for verification.

03:35:08.420 --> 03:35:13.420
They've got, you can do, they've got a free system which is questionable where you submit

03:35:13.420 --> 03:35:17.420
an ID and it's been shown, several bypasses have been shown.

03:35:17.420 --> 03:35:21.420
And I don't want to talk about their security horribly bad because I want to be honest,

03:35:21.420 --> 03:35:24.420
there are bypasses for a lot of security systems out there.

03:35:24.420 --> 03:35:25.420
All right.

03:35:25.420 --> 03:35:33.420
The issue that I have with ID me is that their policies are somewhat questionable.

03:35:33.420 --> 03:35:38.420
I don't care if you're a private company that has those policies in place, but if you're

03:35:38.420 --> 03:35:44.420
a government agency and you as a citizen are entitled to a benefit or a service of that

03:35:44.420 --> 03:35:50.420
government agency, and then the government agency forces you to give up your complete

03:35:50.420 --> 03:35:55.420
identity profile to a private company, and then that private company uses that profile

03:35:55.420 --> 03:35:59.420
for marketing purposes to further profit, things like that.

03:35:59.420 --> 03:36:01.420
I have a huge issue with that.

03:36:01.420 --> 03:36:03.420
I don't care if you're a private company that does that.

03:36:03.420 --> 03:36:07.420
I just don't think the citizens need to be forced into doing that in order to get a benefit

03:36:07.420 --> 03:36:09.420
or service that they're entitled to.

03:36:09.420 --> 03:36:11.420
So that's, that's my big issue.

03:36:11.420 --> 03:36:16.420
So that, I mean, given how much value, how much we talked about the value of identity,

03:36:16.420 --> 03:36:19.420
you don't think that should be handed over lightly?

03:36:19.420 --> 03:36:21.420
No, absolutely not.

03:36:21.420 --> 03:36:24.420
And who would have thought that Brett Johnson would ever become a privacy advocate?

03:36:26.420 --> 03:36:28.420
But here I am.

03:36:28.420 --> 03:36:37.420
I mean, it's just, people don't understand or appreciate the value of who they are.

03:36:37.420 --> 03:36:42.420
You know, and certainly you've got a host of companies, ID means not the only one, but

03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:47.420
you've got some of these companies that say, well, we strip out the PII of the individual.

03:36:47.420 --> 03:36:51.420
We're just using the biometrics and the sites they're visiting and things like that.

03:36:51.420 --> 03:36:52.420
That's identity.

03:36:52.420 --> 03:36:56.420
That is, you can still ping that one unique individual out of all, using that information,

03:36:56.420 --> 03:37:00.420
stripping out the PII, you can still ping who that individual is.

03:37:00.420 --> 03:37:08.420
So having lived a life of crime for many years, I'm sure you've connected indirectly to a

03:37:08.420 --> 03:37:10.420
large number of very dangerous people.

03:37:10.420 --> 03:37:12.420
Indirectly, indirectly.

03:37:12.420 --> 03:37:17.420
But the network indirectly is even larger, right?

03:37:17.420 --> 03:37:18.420
Oh yeah.

03:37:18.420 --> 03:37:20.420
Are you, and I apologize for this question.

03:37:20.420 --> 03:37:26.420
Are you ever worried for your life, for your wellbeing?

03:37:26.420 --> 03:37:34.420
Like having seen a world that's really dangerous in ways that's not, that operates in the shadows.

03:37:34.420 --> 03:37:43.420
You know, like I said, when we started Shadow Crew and started that initial cybercrime business,

03:37:43.420 --> 03:37:47.420
that world, violence wasn't there.

03:37:47.420 --> 03:37:48.420
It came in later.

03:37:48.420 --> 03:37:52.420
Now violence is inherent in the system to do the Monty Python bit.

03:37:52.420 --> 03:37:54.420
It's part of it.

03:37:54.420 --> 03:37:58.420
The mob, the mafia are now part of this whole thing.

03:37:58.420 --> 03:37:59.420
Cartels are part of it.

03:37:59.420 --> 03:38:05.420
Drugs are inherently intertwined in cybercrime marketplaces because of the profit potential.

03:38:05.420 --> 03:38:08.420
And with that comes a lot of violence as well.

03:38:08.420 --> 03:38:13.420
The cartels have already brought the violence that they're good at from the 20th century

03:38:13.420 --> 03:38:16.420
into the technology of the 21st century.

03:38:16.420 --> 03:38:19.420
Now, do I worry about that?

03:38:19.420 --> 03:38:24.420
It's interesting that my family worries about that.

03:38:24.420 --> 03:38:26.420
All right.

03:38:26.420 --> 03:38:31.420
I think I may be just too involved in it to appreciate that type of danger.

03:38:31.420 --> 03:38:34.420
But my family worries about that.

03:38:34.420 --> 03:38:35.420
They do.

03:38:35.420 --> 03:38:37.420
Do I think it's a possibility?

03:38:37.420 --> 03:38:40.420
I'm the guy that says what needs to be said.

03:38:41.420 --> 03:38:50.420
I've built my trust in this industry by not being scared of calling out companies and individuals

03:38:50.420 --> 03:38:54.420
and not being scared of targeting criminals or criminal groups.

03:38:54.420 --> 03:39:02.420
Your honesty as a human being emotionally and intellectually is really refreshing.

03:39:02.420 --> 03:39:03.420
It's a gift.

03:39:03.420 --> 03:39:04.420
Thank you.

03:39:04.420 --> 03:39:06.420
Thank you for doing that.

03:39:06.420 --> 03:39:13.420
Is there advice you can give to young people today about life?

03:39:13.420 --> 03:39:18.420
You broke many rules, all the rules.

03:39:18.420 --> 03:39:21.420
Some rules should be broken.

03:39:21.420 --> 03:39:24.420
So if you look at somebody young today in high school and college,

03:39:24.420 --> 03:39:29.420
thinking how they can break the rules legally

03:39:29.420 --> 03:39:35.420
and live a life that's something they could be really proud of, what would you say?

03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:38.420
Biggest lesson I've learned.

03:39:38.420 --> 03:39:45.420
You want your life to be one where you're helping people and not hurting people.

03:39:45.420 --> 03:39:50.420
And that really hit me the first time I walked into Quantico.

03:39:50.420 --> 03:39:56.420
You see the brightest minds in the United States who give up a lot of money,

03:39:56.420 --> 03:40:01.420
opportunities, a lot of money, because they believe in helping people.

03:40:01.420 --> 03:40:07.420
Where I spent a career just hurting and harming individuals, that's a hell of a lesson.

03:40:07.420 --> 03:40:09.420
And I'm glad I'm there.

03:40:09.420 --> 03:40:13.420
But I would tell people out there, you know, it's fine to want money.

03:40:13.420 --> 03:40:14.420
It's fine to do that.

03:40:14.420 --> 03:40:16.420
It's fine to test systems.

03:40:16.420 --> 03:40:19.420
It's fine to circumvent the rules if you're not breaking the law.

03:40:19.420 --> 03:40:20.420
It's fine to do all that.

03:40:20.420 --> 03:40:21.420
I like doing that.

03:40:21.420 --> 03:40:22.420
All right.

03:40:22.420 --> 03:40:26.420
But if you've got the mindset, if you can just adhere to the mindset of helping people

03:40:26.420 --> 03:40:30.420
and not hurting people, I think you'll be all right at the end of the day.

03:40:30.420 --> 03:40:36.420
What gives you, again, given the dark web, given all the dangers out there,

03:40:36.420 --> 03:40:42.420
what gives you hope about the future, looking into five, 10 years, 50 years,

03:40:42.420 --> 03:40:44.420
I mean, hope for human civilization?

03:40:44.420 --> 03:40:52.420
If we do all right, if we make it out of this century,

03:40:52.420 --> 03:40:54.420
what do you think would be the reason?

03:40:56.420 --> 03:40:58.420
That's a damn good question.

03:40:58.420 --> 03:41:00.420
I mean, we've got a lot of bad stuff going on.

03:41:00.420 --> 03:41:02.420
We've got a lot of reasons.

03:41:02.420 --> 03:41:07.420
If I asked you the other question of how do you think human civilization will destroy itself,

03:41:07.420 --> 03:41:09.420
I'm sure you have a lot of answers.

03:41:09.420 --> 03:41:15.420
You know, what gives me hope is you see people working together.

03:41:15.420 --> 03:41:21.420
COVID has been a little bit different because I think too many people wanted to play politics with it.

03:41:21.420 --> 03:41:26.420
That's been the heartbreaking thing about COVID is it's in many ways pulled people apart.

03:41:26.420 --> 03:41:33.420
I mean, because a virus involves kind of being afraid of each other because,

03:41:33.420 --> 03:41:35.420
I mean, that was a scary thing.

03:41:35.420 --> 03:41:39.420
People talk about pandemics in that way that you're afraid of other humans.

03:41:39.420 --> 03:41:41.420
That is the most terrifying thing.

03:41:41.420 --> 03:41:43.420
It's not the destructive nature of what it does to your body.

03:41:43.420 --> 03:41:46.420
It's just that it pulls people apart.

03:41:46.420 --> 03:41:50.420
And then you realize how fundamental that human connection is to humans.

03:41:50.420 --> 03:41:52.420
Absolutely.

03:41:52.420 --> 03:41:59.420
But, you know, we, as human beings, we do, when things really get bad,

03:41:59.420 --> 03:42:03.420
when things really get bad, we do tend to respond and group together.

03:42:03.420 --> 03:42:05.420
We do that.

03:42:05.420 --> 03:42:08.420
When there's injustice, we see it.

03:42:08.420 --> 03:42:10.420
We rise up.

03:42:10.420 --> 03:42:17.420
I wake up in the morning and I watch Fox News and CNN so I can be pissed off at everyone.

03:42:18.420 --> 03:42:22.420
The division, the outrage, they're really feeding.

03:42:22.420 --> 03:42:23.420
They want you.

03:42:23.420 --> 03:42:25.420
They want you to be angry.

03:42:25.420 --> 03:42:26.420
Yeah.

03:42:26.420 --> 03:42:30.420
That's what causes me to despair and what I think that, you know, we just need to.

03:42:30.420 --> 03:42:32.420
Elizabeth was very good.

03:42:32.420 --> 03:42:37.420
She taught me one hell of a lesson because before I met her, I was a news hound.

03:42:37.420 --> 03:42:40.420
News would be on all the time, a couple channels of it.

03:42:40.420 --> 03:42:45.420
And she was the woman who didn't watch the news at all.

03:42:45.420 --> 03:42:49.420
And I didn't understand that back then, man, but now I do.

03:42:49.420 --> 03:42:53.420
You know, now I'm like, it's pretty smart, you know?

03:42:53.420 --> 03:42:55.420
Don't need to listen to that bullshit as it is.

03:42:55.420 --> 03:42:58.420
That's why I love reading history books.

03:42:58.420 --> 03:43:05.420
You know, I just, I feel like that's the right perspective on take on modern times.

03:43:05.420 --> 03:43:08.420
You know, how will this time be written about in the history books?

03:43:08.420 --> 03:43:09.420
Yeah.

03:43:10.420 --> 03:43:14.420
The daily ups and downs of the outrages,

03:43:14.420 --> 03:43:20.420
which is getting worse and worse in terms of how quick the turnaround is in terms of the news.

03:43:20.420 --> 03:43:22.420
I'll tell you what, I'm sitting here.

03:43:22.420 --> 03:43:24.420
I appreciate you talking to me.

03:43:24.420 --> 03:43:25.420
I do.

03:43:25.420 --> 03:43:28.420
Because, you know, I'm talking about that relationship and everything.

03:43:28.420 --> 03:43:32.420
It's really been this kind of realization for me on a lot of things.

03:43:32.420 --> 03:43:35.420
So I really appreciate you asking those questions and everything.

03:43:35.420 --> 03:43:36.420
May be able to talk about that.

03:43:36.420 --> 03:43:41.420
I love it that you value, first of all,

03:43:41.420 --> 03:43:46.420
you're self-aware how important love is in a human being's life.

03:43:46.420 --> 03:43:49.420
It can make you do some of the best and some of the worst things in this world.

03:43:49.420 --> 03:43:51.420
And it's good to think about that.

03:43:51.420 --> 03:43:52.420
It's good to think about that.

03:43:52.420 --> 03:43:56.420
That is what makes us human is that connection and that love for each other.

03:43:59.420 --> 03:44:01.420
What do you think is the meaning of life?

03:44:01.420 --> 03:44:02.420
This big ridiculous question.

03:44:02.420 --> 03:44:03.420
Why the hell?

03:44:03.420 --> 03:44:04.420
What are we all here for?

03:44:04.420 --> 03:44:05.420
I don't think it is ridiculous, man.

03:44:05.420 --> 03:44:12.420
To me, that meaning of life is finding out that lesson that we need to help each other.

03:44:12.420 --> 03:44:15.420
If you ask about security, I didn't get to say that.

03:44:15.420 --> 03:44:18.420
But, you know, everybody's worried about themselves.

03:44:18.420 --> 03:44:25.420
The way you solve that security problem is it takes everybody looking out for everyone else.

03:44:25.420 --> 03:44:28.420
That's how you solve that problem.

03:44:28.420 --> 03:44:33.420
And however you take, whatever journey you take to discovering that point.

03:44:33.420 --> 03:44:34.420
Yeah.

03:44:34.420 --> 03:44:38.420
I mean, with me, I've been asked a few times, do you regret anything?

03:44:38.420 --> 03:44:39.420
Would you change anything?

03:44:39.420 --> 03:44:45.420
Now, I've done a shitload of despicable things in my life.

03:44:45.420 --> 03:44:49.420
But I'm at a point in my life where I like who I am.

03:44:49.420 --> 03:44:53.420
And I know that I am doing exactly what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.

03:44:53.420 --> 03:44:58.420
So when I change anything, as bad as a lot of that shit has been, I wouldn't.

03:44:58.420 --> 03:45:00.420
It made you who you are.

03:45:00.420 --> 03:45:01.420
Yeah.

03:45:01.420 --> 03:45:02.420
The whole of it.

03:45:02.420 --> 03:45:05.420
I mean, that's trite to say that, but it's true.

03:45:05.420 --> 03:45:06.420
That's the weird thing.

03:45:06.420 --> 03:45:07.420
It's true.

03:45:07.420 --> 03:45:08.420
Yeah.

03:45:08.420 --> 03:45:09.420
Yeah.

03:45:09.420 --> 03:45:13.420
Also, you mentioned that you're thinking of launching a show.

03:45:13.420 --> 03:45:14.420
What's it going to be called?

03:45:14.420 --> 03:45:16.420
Because you've done a couple of podcasts.

03:45:16.420 --> 03:45:17.420
You're incredibly good at this.

03:45:17.420 --> 03:45:18.420
You're so good at this.

03:45:18.420 --> 03:45:19.420
I've done a couple.

03:45:19.420 --> 03:45:22.420
I'm on a lot of podcasts and everything like that.

03:45:22.420 --> 03:45:26.420
I had the Fraudcast with a friend of mine, Carice Hendrick.

03:45:26.420 --> 03:45:29.420
And that ended because of a difference of opinion.

03:45:30.420 --> 03:45:33.420
Depending on who you ask, one of us was an asshole.

03:45:33.420 --> 03:45:34.420
Yes.

03:45:34.420 --> 03:45:35.420
And it may have been me.

03:45:35.420 --> 03:45:36.420
Yeah.

03:45:36.420 --> 03:45:39.420
But then I did the Anglerfish podcast, which that was, I got to be honest with you, Lex,

03:45:39.420 --> 03:45:41.420
it was completely directionless.

03:45:41.420 --> 03:45:43.420
And it was Brett Johnson getting lazy.

03:45:43.420 --> 03:45:44.420
Yeah.

03:45:44.420 --> 03:45:46.420
So I ended that.

03:45:46.420 --> 03:45:49.420
The Brett Johnson Show is launching.

03:45:49.420 --> 03:45:50.420
That's the new one.

03:45:50.420 --> 03:45:51.420
That's the new one.

03:45:51.420 --> 03:45:52.420
That's what the new one is called.

03:45:52.420 --> 03:45:53.420
And you know, I-

03:45:53.420 --> 03:45:56.420
What are you thinking of doing with it?

03:45:56.420 --> 03:45:58.420
Making a difference, for one thing.

03:45:58.420 --> 03:46:02.420
But it's going to be talking about cybercrime security, helping people.

03:46:02.420 --> 03:46:03.420
Interviews.

03:46:03.420 --> 03:46:04.420
Interviews.

03:46:04.420 --> 03:46:06.420
A lot of it's going to be solo.

03:46:06.420 --> 03:46:10.420
Now I'm calling it the Brett Johnson Show, I mean, because it's going to handle crime,

03:46:10.420 --> 03:46:13.420
talk to criminals and how they turn their lives around to a degree as well.

03:46:13.420 --> 03:46:15.420
But there's some shit I want to bitch about too.

03:46:15.420 --> 03:46:16.420
Yeah.

03:46:16.420 --> 03:46:17.420
So figure it out.

03:46:17.420 --> 03:46:18.420
I can tell you're good at this.

03:46:18.420 --> 03:46:19.420
I'm a fan already.

03:46:19.420 --> 03:46:20.420
I'm going to listen.

03:46:20.420 --> 03:46:21.420
I'm going to subscribe.

03:46:21.420 --> 03:46:22.420
You should too.

03:46:22.420 --> 03:46:23.420
You're launching it soon.

03:46:23.420 --> 03:46:24.420
Soon.

03:46:24.420 --> 03:46:25.420
Next week.

03:46:25.420 --> 03:46:26.420
You're an incredible human being.

03:46:26.420 --> 03:46:29.420
The honesty, the love.

03:46:29.420 --> 03:46:33.420
I could just see how much of yourself you put out there.

03:46:33.420 --> 03:46:36.420
One of the best public speakers I've ever heard.

03:46:36.420 --> 03:46:41.420
Definitely you should be in a Scorsese film about cybercrime.

03:46:41.420 --> 03:46:42.420
One hundred percent.

03:46:42.420 --> 03:46:43.420
I could tell you're a good actor.

03:46:43.420 --> 03:46:45.420
It makes perfect sense.

03:46:45.420 --> 03:46:48.420
Anyway, I really am deeply honored that you've spent your time with me today.

03:46:48.420 --> 03:46:49.420
I am too.

03:46:49.420 --> 03:46:50.420
Thank you.

03:46:50.420 --> 03:46:51.420
It was amazing.

03:46:51.420 --> 03:46:53.420
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brett Johnson.

03:46:53.420 --> 03:46:57.420

03:46:57.420 --> 03:47:03.420
And now let me leave you with some words from George R.R. Martin from A Clash of Kings.

03:47:03.420 --> 03:47:09.420
A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the good.

03:47:09.420 --> 03:47:12.420
Each should have its own reward.

03:47:12.420 --> 03:47:15.420
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

03:47:23.420 --> 03:47:24.420
Thank you.
