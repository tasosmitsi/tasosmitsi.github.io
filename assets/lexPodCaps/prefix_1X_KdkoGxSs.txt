00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
a good point. No, no, it's a good point. Now, some people accuse me of speaking very slowly,

00:06.080 --> 00:12.080
and they're advised on YouTube to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on.

00:12.880 --> 00:20.480
One of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach value to every word I say. Normal,

00:20.480 --> 00:24.560
say this all over and over and over again. I only deal in facts. I don't deal in hypotheticals. I

00:24.560 --> 00:28.480
only deal in facts. I only deal in facts. And that seems to be the case, except for when the

00:28.480 --> 00:32.400
facts are completely and totally contrary to the particular point you're trying to push.

00:32.400 --> 00:37.680
The idea that Jews would have out of hand rejected any state that had Arabs on it or

00:37.680 --> 00:41.120
always had a plan of expulsion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the 47 partition plan.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.440
I don't think you understand politics.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.240
They forced the British to prevent immigration of Jews from Europe and reaching safe shores

00:48.240 --> 00:53.120
in Palestine. That's what they did. And they knew that the Jews were being persecuted in Europe.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.640
Was Palestine the only spot of land on earth?

00:56.640 --> 00:59.680
Yes. Basically, that was the problem. The Jews couldn't emigrate in Europe.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.160
What about your great friends in Britain, the architects of the Balfour Declaration?

01:04.160 --> 01:09.520
By the late 1930s, they weren't happy to take in Jews, and the Americans weren't happy to take in

01:09.520 --> 01:09.760
Jews.

01:09.760 --> 01:15.520
And why are Palestinians, who were not Europeans, who had zero role in the rise of Nazism,

01:16.160 --> 01:20.640
who had no relation to any of this, why are they somehow uniquely responsible

01:21.280 --> 01:22.800
for what happened in Europe and uniquely culpable?

01:22.800 --> 01:25.520
Because they were helping to close the only safe haven for Jews.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.160
Professor Morris, because of your logic, and I'm not disputing it,

01:31.040 --> 01:32.880
that's why October 7th happened.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.840
Oh my God.

01:33.840 --> 01:38.480
Because there was no options left for those people.

01:38.480 --> 01:44.240
The Hamas guys who attacked the Kibbutzim, apart from the attacks on the military sites,

01:44.240 --> 01:48.400
when they attacked the Kibbutzim, were out to kill civilians. And they killed

01:48.400 --> 01:51.120
family after family, house after house.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.200
Talk fast so people think that you're coherent.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.400
I'm just reading from the UN.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.520
You like them sometimes, only when they agree with you, though.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.000
But you've lied about this particular instance in the past.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.640
Those kids weren't just on the beaches, as often stated in articles.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.080
Those kids were literally coming out of a previously identified Hamas compound

02:06.080 --> 02:07.360
that they had operated from.

02:07.360 --> 02:15.840
Mr. Borrelli, with all due respect, you're such a fantastic moron. It's terrifying.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.920
The following is a debate on the topic of Israel and Palestine.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.560
With Norman Filkenstein, Benny Morris, Muayen Rabbani, and Stephen Bonnell,

02:26.560 --> 02:28.320
also known online as Destiny.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.840
Norm and Benny are historians, Muayen is a Middle East analyst,

02:33.840 --> 02:36.960
and Stephen is a political commentator and streamer.

02:36.960 --> 02:40.400
All four have spoken and debated extensively on this topic.

02:41.120 --> 02:45.520
The goal for this debate was not for anyone to win or to score points.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.560
It wasn't to get views or likes.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.040
I never care about those.

02:51.120 --> 02:55.760
And I think there are probably much easier ways to get those things if I did care.

02:56.800 --> 03:02.080
The goal was to explore, together, the history, present, and future of Israel and Palestine

03:02.080 --> 03:03.680
in a free-flowing conversation.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.400
No time limits, no rules.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.880
There was a lot of tension in the room from the very beginning,

03:10.880 --> 03:14.240
and it only got more intense as we went along.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.840
And I quickly realized that this very conversation,

03:18.400 --> 03:25.200
in a very real human way, was a microcosm of the tensions and distance and perspectives

03:25.200 --> 03:26.880
on the topic of Israel and Palestine.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.960
For some debates, I will step in and moderate strictly to prevent emotion from boiling.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.680
For this, I saw the value in not interfering with the passion of the exchanges,

03:37.680 --> 03:40.800
because that emotion in itself spoke volumes.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.320
We did talk about the history and the future,

03:44.880 --> 03:51.920
but the anger, the frustration, the biting wit, and, at times, respect and camaraderie

03:51.920 --> 03:52.800
were all there.

03:53.520 --> 03:58.400
Like I said, we did it in a perhaps all too human way.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.880
I will do more debates and conversations on these difficult topics,

04:02.880 --> 04:07.360
and I will continue to search for hope in the midst of death and destruction,

04:07.920 --> 04:12.800
to search for our common humanity in the midst of division and hate.

04:13.760 --> 04:19.920
This thing we have going on, human civilization, the whole of it, is beautiful,

04:21.200 --> 04:25.680
and it's worth figuring out how we can help it flourish together.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.520
I love you all.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.880
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.600
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.800
And now, dear friends, here's Norman Ficklestein, Benny Morris,

04:38.800 --> 04:41.600
William Rabani, and Stephen Bonneau.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.640
First question is about 1948.

04:45.680 --> 04:51.360
For Israelis, 1948 is the establishment of the state of Israel and the War of Independence.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.280
For Palestinians, 1948 is the Nakba, which means catastrophe,

04:56.000 --> 05:01.200
or the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes as a consequence of the war.

05:01.840 --> 05:06.160
What, to you, is important to understand about the events of 1948,

05:06.160 --> 05:11.440
and the period around there, 47, 49, that helps us understand what's going on today?

05:12.160 --> 05:17.440
And maybe helps us understand the roots of all of this that started even before 1948.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.320
I was hoping that Norm could speak first, and Benny, then Muin, and then Steve.

05:24.800 --> 05:33.040
After World War II, the British decided that they didn't want to deal with the Palestine

05:33.040 --> 05:38.400
question anymore, and the ball was thrown into the court of the United Nations.

05:38.400 --> 05:48.800
Now, as I read the record, the UN was not attempting to arbitrate or adjudicate rights

05:48.800 --> 05:57.200
and wrongs. It was confronting a very practical problem. There were two national communities

05:58.000 --> 06:05.520
in Palestine, and there were irreconcilable differences on fundamental questions,

06:06.240 --> 06:11.520
most importantly, looking at the historic record on the question of immigration,

06:12.480 --> 06:17.200
and associated with the question of immigration, the question of land.

06:19.120 --> 06:25.680
The UN Special Committee on Palestine, which came into being before the UN

06:26.400 --> 06:35.440
181 Partition Resolution, the UN Special Committee recommended two states in Palestine.

06:36.400 --> 06:47.360
There was a minority position represented by Iran, India, Yugoslavia. They supported one state,

06:48.320 --> 06:58.720
but they believed that if forced to, the two communities would figure out some sort of modus

06:58.720 --> 07:08.560
vendi and live together. The United Nations General Assembly supported partition between

07:08.560 --> 07:16.320
what it called a Jewish state and an Arab state. Now, in my reading of the record,

07:16.320 --> 07:19.680
and I understand there's new scholarship in the subject, which I've not read,

07:20.640 --> 07:27.520
but so far as I've read the record, there's no clarity on what the United Nations

07:28.720 --> 07:37.280
General Assembly meant by a Jewish state and an Arab state, except for the fact that the

07:37.280 --> 07:44.720
Jewish state would be demographically, the majority would be Jewish, and the Arab state

07:44.720 --> 07:53.440
demographically would be Arab. The UNSCOP, the UN Special Committee on Palestine,

07:54.240 --> 08:03.200
it was very clear, and it was reiterated many times, that in recommending two states,

08:04.560 --> 08:12.480
each state, the Arab state and the Jewish state, would have to guarantee full equality of all

08:12.480 --> 08:21.200
citizens with regard to political, civil, and religious matters. Now, that does raise the

08:21.200 --> 08:28.880
question, if there is absolute full equality of all citizens, both in the Jewish state

08:29.520 --> 08:36.320
and the Arab state, with regard to political rights, civil rights, and religious rights,

08:37.280 --> 08:44.560
apart from the demographic majority, it's very unclear what it meant to call a state Jewish

08:45.200 --> 08:55.120
or call a state Arab. In my view, the partition resolution was the correct decision.

08:56.560 --> 09:04.560
I do not believe that the Arab and Jewish communities could, at that point, be made

09:04.560 --> 09:10.960
to live together. I disagree with the minority position of India, Iran, and Yugoslavia,

09:11.920 --> 09:19.200
and that not being a practical option, two states was the only other option.

09:20.720 --> 09:28.000
In this regard, I would want to pay tribute to what was probably the most moving speech

09:28.640 --> 09:34.000
at the UN General Assembly proceedings by the Soviet Foreign Minister,

09:34.640 --> 09:43.840
Romiko. I was very tempted to quote it at length, but I recognized that would be

09:45.600 --> 09:54.800
taking too much time, so I asked a young friend, Jamie Sternweiner, to edit it and just get the

09:54.800 --> 10:03.840
essence of what Foreign Minister Romiko had to say. During the last war, Romiko said,

10:04.800 --> 10:11.120
the Jewish people underwent exceptional sorrow and suffering.

10:12.560 --> 10:19.760
Without any exaggeration, this sorrow and suffering are indescribable.

10:20.400 --> 10:26.720
Hundreds of thousands of Jews are wandering about in various countries of Europe

10:27.440 --> 10:36.800
in search of means of existence and in search of shelter. The United Nations cannot and must not

10:36.800 --> 10:45.600
regard this situation with indifference. Past experience, particularly during the Second World

10:46.480 --> 10:56.960
War, shows that no Western European state was able to provide adequate assistance for the

10:56.960 --> 11:04.880
Jewish people in defending its rights and its very existence from the violence of the Hitlerites

11:05.520 --> 11:14.480
and their allies. This is an unpleasant fact, but unfortunately, like all other facts,

11:15.440 --> 11:24.880
it must be admitted. Romiko went on to say, in principle, he supports one state, or the

11:24.880 --> 11:34.000
Soviet Union supports one state, but he said, if relations between the Jewish and Arab populations

11:34.000 --> 11:43.280
of Palestine proved to be so bad that it would be impossible to reconcile them and to ensure the

11:43.280 --> 11:51.120
peaceful coexistence of the Arabs and the Jews, the Soviet Union would support two states.

11:53.120 --> 12:01.200
I personally am not convinced that the two states would have been unsustainable

12:01.200 --> 12:09.760
in the long term if, and this is a big if, the Zionist movement had been faithful

12:10.480 --> 12:20.080
to the position it proclaimed during the UNSCOP public hearings. At the time, Ben-Gurion testified,

12:23.200 --> 12:32.240
I want to express what we mean by a Jewish state. We mean by a Jewish state simply a state

12:33.040 --> 12:40.080
where the majority of the people are Jews, not a state where a Jew has in any way

12:41.280 --> 12:51.440
any privilege more than anyone else. A Jewish state means a state based on absolute equality

12:52.000 --> 13:04.000
of all her citizens and on democracy. Alas, this was not to be. As Professor Morris has written,

13:06.480 --> 13:17.520
Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist. And then he wrote in

13:17.520 --> 13:29.040
another book, Transfer, the euphemism for expulsion. Transfer was inevitable and inbuilt

13:29.680 --> 13:38.800
into Zionism because it sought to transform a land which was Arab into a Jewish state.

13:39.760 --> 13:47.440
And a Jewish state could not have arisen without a major displacement of Arab population.

13:48.560 --> 13:56.800
And because this aim automatically produced resistance among the Arabs, which in turn

13:56.800 --> 14:03.360
persuaded the yeshuvs leaders, the yeshuv being the Jewish community, the yeshuvs leaders that

14:03.520 --> 14:10.080
a hostile Arab majority or a large minority could not remain in place

14:11.040 --> 14:20.000
if a Jewish state was to arise or safely endure. Or as Professor Morris retrospectively put it,

14:20.640 --> 14:30.880
quote, a removing of a population was needed. Without a population expulsion,

14:31.920 --> 14:42.640
a Jewish state would not have been established, unquote. The Arab side rejected outright the

14:42.640 --> 14:48.960
partition resolution. I won't play games with that. I know a lot of people try to prove it's not true.

14:49.600 --> 14:56.960
It clearly, in my view, is true. The Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution

14:58.240 --> 15:09.840
while Israeli leaders acting on the compulsions, inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism,

15:11.040 --> 15:17.600
found the pretext in the course of the first Arab-Israeli war to expel the indigenous

15:17.600 --> 15:29.040
population and expand its borders. I therefore conclude that neither side was committed to the

15:29.040 --> 15:36.560
letter of the partition resolution and both sides aborted it. Thank you, Norm. Norm asked that you

15:36.560 --> 15:41.920
make a lengthy statement in the beginning. Benny, I hope it's okay to call everybody by their first

15:41.920 --> 15:48.240
name in the name of camaraderie. Norm has quoted several things you said. Perhaps you can comment

15:48.240 --> 15:52.560
broadly on the question of 1948 and maybe respond to the things that Norm said.

15:53.360 --> 16:01.200
Yeah. UNSCOP, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, recommended partition,

16:01.200 --> 16:05.840
the majority of UNSCOP recommended partition, which was accepted by the UN General Assembly in

16:05.920 --> 16:14.240
November 1947, essentially looking back to the Peel Commission in 1937. Ten years earlier,

16:14.240 --> 16:20.160
a British commission had looked at the problem of Palestine, the two warring national groups who

16:20.160 --> 16:28.320
refused to live together, if you like, or consolidate a unitary state between them.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.560
Peel said there should be two states. That's the principle. The country must be partitioned

16:34.560 --> 16:40.560
into two states. This would give a modicum of justice to both sides, if not all their demands,

16:40.560 --> 16:47.120
of course. The United Nations followed suit. The United Nations UNSCOP and then the UN General

16:47.120 --> 16:53.280
Assembly representing the will of the international community said two states is the just solution

16:53.280 --> 16:59.360
in this complex situation. The problem was that immediately with the passage of the resolution,

17:00.080 --> 17:07.520
the Arab states and the Arabs of Palestine said no, as Norman Finkelstein said. They said no,

17:07.520 --> 17:13.840
they rejected the partition idea, the principle of partition, not just the idea of what percentage

17:13.840 --> 17:18.320
which side should get, but the principle of partition they said no to. The Jews should

17:18.320 --> 17:24.720
not have any part of Palestine for their sovereign territory. Maybe Jews could live as a minority in

17:24.720 --> 17:29.680
Palestine. That also was problematic in the eyes of the Palestinian Arab leadership.

17:29.680 --> 17:36.320
Hussein had said only Jews who were there before 1917 could actually get citizenship and continue

17:36.320 --> 17:42.080
to live there. But the Arabs rejected partition and the Arabs of Palestine launched, in a very

17:42.080 --> 17:47.120
disorganized fashion, war against the resolution, against the implementation of the resolution,

17:47.120 --> 17:53.920
against the Jewish community in Palestine. And this was their defeat in that civil war

17:53.920 --> 17:57.440
between the two communities while the British were withdrawing from Palestine

17:59.280 --> 18:06.480
led to the Arab invasion, the invasion by the Arab states in May 1948 of the country.

18:06.480 --> 18:12.160
Again, basically with the idea of eradicating or preventing the emergence of a Jewish state

18:12.160 --> 18:17.120
in line with the United Nations decision and the will of the international community.

18:18.080 --> 18:24.240
Norman said that the Zionist enterprise, and he quoted me, meant from the beginning

18:25.360 --> 18:31.200
to transfer or expel the Arabs of Palestine or some of the Arabs of Palestine.

18:32.080 --> 18:38.000
And I think he's sort of quoting out of context. The context in which the statements were made,

18:38.000 --> 18:44.560
that the Jewish state could only emerge if there was a transfer of Arab population,

18:44.640 --> 18:50.960
was preceded in the way I wrote it and the way it actually happened by Arab resistance

18:50.960 --> 18:55.520
and hostilities towards the Jewish community. Had the Arabs accepted partition, there would

18:55.520 --> 19:01.680
have been a large Arab minority in the Jewish state, which emerged in 1947. And in fact,

19:01.680 --> 19:09.280
Jewish economists and state builders took into account that there would be a large Arab minority

19:09.280 --> 19:16.240
and its needs would be cared for, et cetera. But this was not to be because the Arabs attacked.

19:16.240 --> 19:22.560
And had they not attacked, perhaps a Jewish state with a large Arab minority could have emerged,

19:22.560 --> 19:27.840
but this didn't happen. They went to war, the Jews resisted. And in the course of that war,

19:28.880 --> 19:34.640
Arab populations were driven out. Some were expelled, some left because Arab leaders

19:35.280 --> 19:40.800
advised them to leave or ordered them to leave. And at the end of the war, Israel said they can't

19:40.800 --> 19:47.360
return because they just tried to destroy the Jewish state. And that's the basic reality of

19:47.360 --> 19:53.120
what happened in 48. The Jews created a state. The Palestinian Arabs never bothered to even try to

19:53.120 --> 20:00.080
create a state before 48 and in the course of the 1948 war. And for that reason, they have no state

20:00.080 --> 20:05.920
to this day. The Jews do have a state because they prepared to establish a state, fought for it,

20:05.920 --> 20:13.600
and established it, hopefully, lastingly. When you said hostility, in case people are

20:13.600 --> 20:23.440
not familiar, there was a full on war where Arab states invaded and Israel won that war.

20:24.000 --> 20:30.800
Let me just add to clarify, the war had two parts to it. The first part was the Arab community in

20:30.800 --> 20:39.040
Palestine, its militiamen, attacked the Jews from November 1947. In other words, from the day after

20:39.040 --> 20:45.040
the UN partition resolution was passed, Arab government were busy shooting up Jews and that

20:45.040 --> 20:51.600
snowballed into a full scale civil war between the two communities in Palestine. In May 1948,

20:51.600 --> 20:57.280
a second stage began in the war in which the Arab states invaded the new state, attacked the new

20:57.280 --> 21:04.160
state, and they too were defeated, and thus the state of Israel emerged. In the course of this

21:04.160 --> 21:10.960
two-stage war, a vast Palestinian refugee problem occurred.

21:11.760 --> 21:18.960
So after that, the transfer, the expulsion, the thing that people call the Nakba happened.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.680
Muin, could you speak to 1948 and the historical significance of it?

21:23.680 --> 21:31.760
Sure. There's a lot to unpack here. I'll try to limit myself to just a few points.

21:32.560 --> 21:40.320
Regarding Zionism and transfer, I think Heim Weizmann, the head of the World Zionist

21:40.320 --> 21:48.080
Organization, had it exactly right when he said that the objective of Zionism is to make Palestine

21:48.080 --> 21:58.400
as Jewish as England as English, or France as French. In other words, as Norman explained,

22:00.160 --> 22:10.720
a Jewish state requires Jewish political demographic and territorial supremacy.

22:11.280 --> 22:17.840
Without those three elements, the state would be Jewish in name only. And I think what

22:17.840 --> 22:26.800
distinguishes Zionism is its insistence, supremacy, and exclusivity. That would be my first point.

22:26.800 --> 22:33.520
The second point is I think what the Soviet foreign minister at the time, Andrei Gromyko,

22:34.080 --> 22:43.120
said is exactly right with one reservation. Gromyko was describing a European savagery

22:43.920 --> 22:50.800
unleashed against Europe's Jews. At the time, it wasn't Palestinians or Arabs.

22:50.800 --> 22:58.960
The savages and the barbarians were European to the core. It had nothing to do with developments

22:58.960 --> 23:06.640
in Palestine or the Middle East. Secondly, at the time that Gromyko was speaking,

23:07.280 --> 23:17.120
those Jewish survivors of the Holocaust and others who were in need of safe haven were still

23:17.120 --> 23:29.600
overwhelmingly on the European continent and not in Palestine. And I think given the scale of the

23:29.680 --> 23:37.920
savagery, I don't think that any one state or country should have borne the responsibility

23:38.880 --> 23:44.800
for addressing this crisis. I think it should have been an international responsibility.

23:46.240 --> 23:51.680
Soviet Union could have contributed. Germany certainly could and should have contributed.

23:52.640 --> 24:00.640
The United Kingdom and the United States, which slammed their doors shut to the persecuted Jews

24:00.640 --> 24:05.360
of Europe as the Nazis were rising to power, they certainly should have played a role.

24:06.080 --> 24:13.040
But instead, what passed for the international community at the time decided to partition

24:13.040 --> 24:19.920
Palestine. And here I think we need to judge the partition resolution against the realities

24:19.920 --> 24:26.640
that obtained at the time. Two-thirds of the population of Palestine was Arab.

24:28.160 --> 24:34.960
The Yishuv, the Jewish community in Palestine, constituted about one-third of the total population

24:35.600 --> 24:45.440
and controlled even less of the land within Palestine. As a preeminent Palestinian historian,

24:46.400 --> 24:53.520
Walid al-Khalidi has pointed out the partition resolution in giving roughly 55%

24:54.240 --> 25:04.480
of Palestine to the Jewish community and I think 41-42% to the Arab community, to the Palestinians,

25:05.360 --> 25:14.000
did not preserve the position of each community or even favor one community at the expense of

25:14.000 --> 25:22.640
the others. Rather, it thoroughly inverted and revolutionized the relationship between

25:23.600 --> 25:33.440
the two communities. And as many have written, the Nakba was the inevitable consequence of

25:33.440 --> 25:41.280
partition given the nature of Zionism, given the territorial disposition, given the weakness of

25:41.280 --> 25:47.360
the Palestinian community whose leadership had been largely decimated during a major revolt at

25:47.360 --> 25:54.880
the end of the 1930s, given that the Arab states were still very much under French and British

25:54.880 --> 26:06.640
influence. The Nakba was the inevitable product of the partition resolution. And one last point

26:06.640 --> 26:16.240
also about the UN's partition resolution is yes, formally that is what the international community

26:16.240 --> 26:22.480
decided on the 29th of November, 1947. It's not a resolution that could ever have gotten through

26:22.480 --> 26:28.400
the UN General Assembly today for a very simple reason. It was a very different general assembly.

26:28.400 --> 26:36.320
Most African, most Asian states were not yet independent. Were the resolution to be placed

26:36.800 --> 26:44.480
before the international community today. And I find it telling that the minority opinion was

26:44.480 --> 26:52.000
led by India, Iran, and Yugoslavia. I think they would have represented the clear majority. So

26:53.120 --> 27:01.520
partition, given what we know about Zionism, given that it was entirely predictable what would happen,

27:01.520 --> 27:10.160
given the realities on the ground in Palestine, was deeply unjust. And the idea that either the

27:10.160 --> 27:20.480
Palestinians or the Arab states could have accepted such a resolution is I think an illusion.

27:21.360 --> 27:28.320
That was in 1947. We saw what happened in 48 and 49. Palestinian society was essentially

27:28.320 --> 27:36.240
destroyed. Over 80% I believe of Palestinians resident in the territory that became the state

27:36.240 --> 27:43.040
of Israel were either expelled or fled and ultimately were ethnically cleansed because

27:43.040 --> 27:48.880
ethnic cleansing consists of two components. It's not just forcing people into refuge or expelling

27:48.880 --> 27:55.760
them. It's just as importantly preventing their return. And here, and Benny Morris has written

27:55.760 --> 28:02.160
I think an article about Yosef Weitz and the transfer committees, there was a very detailed

28:02.160 --> 28:07.920
initiative to prevent the return. And it consisted of raising hundreds of Palestinian villages to the

28:07.920 --> 28:14.240
ground, which was systematically implemented and so on. And so Palestinians became a stateless

28:14.240 --> 28:22.320
people. Now, what is the most important reason that no Arab state was established in Palestine?

28:22.320 --> 28:33.120
Well, since the 1930s, the Zionist leadership and the Hashemite leadership of Jordan, as it's been

28:34.480 --> 28:39.520
thoroughly researched and written about by the Israeli-British historian Avi Schleim,

28:39.520 --> 28:49.840
essentially colluded to prevent the establishment of an independent Arab state in Palestine in the

28:49.840 --> 28:59.840
late 1940s. There's much more here, but I think those are the key points I would make about 1948.

28:59.840 --> 29:04.960
We may talk about Zionism, Britain, UN Assemblies, and all the things you mentioned,

29:04.960 --> 29:10.800
there's a lot to dig into. So again, if we can keep it to just one statement moving forward

29:11.600 --> 29:15.840
after Steven, if you want to go a little longer. Also, we should acknowledge the fact that the

29:15.840 --> 29:22.720
speaking speeds of people here are different. Steven speaks about 10 times faster than me.

29:22.720 --> 29:28.160
Steven, do you want to comment on 1948? Yeah, I think it's interesting where people choose to

29:28.160 --> 29:33.840
start the history. I noticed a lot of people like to start at either 47 or 48 because it's the first

29:33.840 --> 29:38.480
time where they can clearly point to a catastrophe that occurs on the Arab side, that they want to

29:38.480 --> 29:45.920
ascribe 100% of the blame to the newly emergent Israeli state too. But I feel like when you have

29:45.920 --> 29:50.960
this type of reading of history, it feels like the goal is to moralize everything first and then to

29:50.960 --> 29:54.880
pick and choose facts that kind of support the statements of your initial moral statement

29:54.880 --> 29:59.840
afterwards. Whenever people are talking about 48 or the establishment of the Arab state,

30:00.480 --> 30:06.560
I never hear about the fact that a civil war started in 47. That was largely instigated

30:06.560 --> 30:11.680
because of the Arab rejectionism of the 47 partition plan. I never hear about the fact

30:11.680 --> 30:16.880
that the majority of the land that was acquired happened by purchases from Jewish organizations

30:16.880 --> 30:23.280
of Palestinian Arabs of the Ottoman Empire before the mandatory period in 1920 even started.

30:24.080 --> 30:28.320
Funnily enough, King Abdullah of Jordan was quoted as saying, the Arabs are as prodigal

30:28.320 --> 30:34.400
in selling their land as they are in weeping about it. I never hear about the multiple times

30:34.400 --> 30:40.880
that Arabs rejected partition, rejected living with Jews, rejected any sort of state that would

30:40.880 --> 30:45.920
have even had any sort of Jewish exclusivity. It's funny because it was brought up before that

30:45.920 --> 30:50.400
the partition plan was unfair and that's why the Arabs rejected it as though they rejected it

30:50.400 --> 30:54.000
because it was unfair, because of the amount of land that Jews were given and not just due to the

30:54.000 --> 30:59.600
fact that Jews were given land at all, as though a 30% partition or a 25% partition would have been

30:59.600 --> 31:04.080
accepted when I don't think that was the reality of the circumstances. I feel like most of the other

31:04.080 --> 31:09.120
stuff has been said but I noticed that whenever people talk about 48 or the years preceding 48,

31:09.760 --> 31:13.760
I think the worst thing that happens is there's a cherry picking of the facts where basically all

31:13.760 --> 31:20.240
of the blame is ascribed to this built-in idea of Zionism that because of a handful of quotes

31:20.240 --> 31:26.240
or because of an ideology we can say that transfer or population expulsion or basically the

31:26.240 --> 31:30.160
mandate of all of these Arabs being kicked off the land was always going to happen when I think

31:30.160 --> 31:33.920
there's a refusal sometimes as well to acknowledge that regardless of the ideas of some of the

31:33.920 --> 31:38.240
Zionist leaders there is a political social and military reality on the ground that they're forced

31:38.240 --> 31:44.000
to contend with and unfortunately the Arabs because of their inability to engage in diplomacy

31:44.000 --> 31:48.480
and only to use tools of war to try to negotiate everything going on in mandatory Palestine

31:48.480 --> 31:53.600
basically always gave the Jews a reason or an excuse to fight and acquire land through that way

31:53.600 --> 31:57.760
because of their refusal to negotiate on anything else whether it was the partition plan in 47,

31:57.760 --> 32:02.160
whether it was the the Lucerne peace conference afterwards where Israel even offered to annex

32:02.160 --> 32:07.040
Gaza in 51 where they offered to take in a hundred thousand refugees every single deal is

32:07.040 --> 32:11.280
just rejected out of hand because the Arabs don't want a Jewish state anywhere in this region of the

32:11.280 --> 32:16.480
world. I would like to engage Professor Morris if you don't mind I'm not with the first name

32:16.480 --> 32:21.600
it's just not my way of relating. You can just call me Morris you don't need the professor.

32:21.600 --> 32:29.840
Okay there's a real problem here and it's been a problem I've had over many years of reading your

32:29.840 --> 32:37.120
work apart perhaps from as grandchild I suspect nobody knows your work better than I do. I've

32:37.120 --> 32:44.160
read it many times not once not twice at least three times everything you've written and the

32:44.160 --> 32:55.680
problem is it's a kind of quicksilver it's very hard to grasp a point and hold you to it so we're

32:55.680 --> 33:02.400
going to try here to see whether we can hold you to a point and then you argue with me the point

33:02.400 --> 33:11.920
I have no problem with that. Your name please? Stephen Bonnell. Okay Mr. Bonnell referred to

33:11.920 --> 33:22.560
cherry picking and handful of quotes. Now it's true that when you wrote your first book on the

33:22.560 --> 33:29.440
Palestinian refugee question you only had a few lines on this issue of transfer. Four pages.

33:30.160 --> 33:34.000
In the first book. In the first book four pages. Maybe four you know I'm not going to quarrel

33:34.000 --> 33:38.640
my memory is not clear we're talking about 40 years ago I read it I read it but then I read

33:38.640 --> 33:46.000
other things about you okay and you were taken to task if my memory is correct that you hadn't

33:46.720 --> 33:52.400
adequately documented the claims of transfer let me allow me to finish

33:53.360 --> 34:00.560
and I thought that was a reasonable challenge because it was an unusual claim from mainstream

34:00.560 --> 34:09.440
Israeli historian to say as you did in that first book that from the very beginning transfer figured

34:09.520 --> 34:15.120
prominently in scientist thinking that wasn't unusual if you read Anita Shapiro

34:15.120 --> 34:22.400
Shapiro you read Shabtai Tevet that was an unusual acknowledgement by you and then

34:23.600 --> 34:30.960
I found it very impressive that in that revised version of your first book

34:31.920 --> 34:43.360
you devoted 25 pages to copiously documenting the salience of transfer

34:44.160 --> 34:54.160
in Zionist thinking and in fact you used a very provocative and resonant phrase

34:55.120 --> 35:07.680
you said that transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism we're not talking about

35:07.680 --> 35:20.400
circumstantial factors a war Arab hostility you said it's inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism

35:20.400 --> 35:31.280
now as I said so we won't be accused of cherry-picking those were 25 very densely

35:31.280 --> 35:40.880
argued pages and then in an interview and I could cite several quotes but I'll choose one

35:41.200 --> 35:53.680
one you said removing a population was needed let's look at the words without a population

35:53.680 --> 36:06.400
expulsion a Jewish state would not have been established now you're the one again I was very

36:06.480 --> 36:13.200
surprised when I read your book here I'm referring to righteous victims I was very

36:13.200 --> 36:23.120
surprised when I came to that page 37 where you wrote that territorial displacement and

36:23.120 --> 36:33.120
dispossession was the chief chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism territorial displacement

36:33.120 --> 36:42.400
and dispossession were the chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism so you then went on to say

36:43.520 --> 36:52.160
because the Arab population rationally feared territorial displacement and dispossession

36:53.120 --> 36:59.520
it of course opposed Zionism that's as normal as Native Americans

37:00.480 --> 37:07.680
opposing the Euro-American manifest destiny in the history of our own country because they

37:07.680 --> 37:19.040
understood it would be at their expense it was inbuilt and inevitable and so now for you to come

37:19.040 --> 37:27.840
along and say that it all happened just because of the war that otherwise the Zionists made all

37:27.840 --> 37:37.440
these plans for a happy minority to live there that simply does not gel it does not cohere it

37:37.440 --> 37:46.080
is not reconcilable with what you yourself have written it was inevitable and inbuilt now in

37:46.080 --> 37:55.120
other situations you've said that's true but I think it was a greater good to establish a Jewish

37:55.120 --> 38:02.480
state at the expense of the indigenous population that's another kind of argument that was Theodore

38:02.480 --> 38:09.040
Roosevelt's argument in our own country he said we don't want the whole of North America to remain

38:09.040 --> 38:16.880
a squalid refuge for these wigwams and teepees we have to get rid of them and make this a great

38:16.880 --> 38:26.080
country but he didn't deny that it was inbuilt and inevitable I think you've made your point

38:27.040 --> 38:33.680
first I'll take up something that Muin said he said that the Nakba was inevitable as have you

38:33.680 --> 38:40.160
and predictable no no no I've never said that it was inevitable and predictable only because the

38:40.160 --> 38:47.760
Arabs assaulted the Jewish community and state in 1947 48 had there been no assault there probably

38:47.760 --> 38:52.640
wouldn't have been a refugee problem there's no reason for a refugee problem to have occurred

38:52.640 --> 38:58.160
expulsions to have occurred a dispossession massive dispossession to occur these occurred

38:58.160 --> 39:06.320
as a result of war now Norman has said that I said that transfer was inbuilt into Zionism

39:06.320 --> 39:12.000
in one way or another and this is certainly true in order to buy land they had the Jews

39:12.880 --> 39:18.240
bought tracts of land on which some Arabs sometimes lived sometimes they bought tracts of land

39:18.240 --> 39:22.960
on which there weren't Arab villages but sometimes they bought land on which there were Arabs and

39:23.040 --> 39:29.280
according to Ottoman law and the British at least in the initial years of the British mandate

39:29.920 --> 39:34.560
the law said that the people who bought the land could do what they liked with the people

39:34.560 --> 39:39.120
who didn't own the land who were basically squatting on the land which is the Arab tenant

39:39.120 --> 39:43.600
farmers which is we're talking about a very small number actually of Arabs who were displaced

39:43.600 --> 39:49.520
as a result of land purchases in the Ottoman period or the mandate period but there was

39:49.520 --> 39:54.080
dispossession in one way they didn't possess the land they didn't own it but they were removed

39:54.080 --> 40:01.360
from the land and this did happen in Zionism and there's if you like an inevitability in

40:01.360 --> 40:07.600
Zionist ideology of buying tracts of land and starting to work it yourself and settle it

40:07.600 --> 40:12.320
with your own people and so on that made sense but what we're really talking about is what happened

40:12.320 --> 40:20.800
in 4748 and in 4748 the Arabs started a war and actually people pay for their mistakes and the

40:20.800 --> 40:26.400
Palestinians have never actually agreed to pay for their mistakes they make mistakes they attack

40:26.400 --> 40:31.680
they suffer as a result and we see something similar going on today in the Gaza Strip

40:31.680 --> 40:38.000
they do something terrible they kill 1200 Jews they abduct 250 women and children and babies and

40:38.800 --> 40:43.920
old people and whatever and then they start screaming please save us from what we did

40:43.920 --> 40:48.800
because the Jews are counter-attacking and this is what happened then and this is what's happening

40:48.800 --> 40:55.200
now there's something fairly similar in the situation here expulsion and this is important

40:55.200 --> 41:01.440
Norman you should pay attention to this you didn't raise that expulsion transfer whenever policy of

41:01.520 --> 41:08.800
the Zionist movement before 47 it doesn't exist in Zionist platforms of the various political

41:08.800 --> 41:15.280
parties of the Zionist organization of the Israeli state of the Jewish agency nobody would have

41:15.280 --> 41:20.080
actually made it into policy because it was always a large minority if there were people who wanted

41:20.080 --> 41:25.760
it always a large minority of Jewish politicians and leaders would have said no this is immoral

41:25.760 --> 41:31.360
we cannot start a state on the basis of an expulsion so it was never adopted and actually

41:31.360 --> 41:37.280
was never adopted as policy even in 48 even though Ben Gurion wanted as few Arabs in the course of

41:37.280 --> 41:42.800
the war staying in the Jewish state after they attacked it he didn't want this loyal citizen

41:42.800 --> 41:47.680
staying there because they wouldn't have been loyal citizens but this made sense in the war

41:47.680 --> 41:55.680
itself but the movement itself and its political parties never accepted it it's true that in 1937

41:55.680 --> 42:02.960
when the British as part of the proposal by the Peel commission to divide the country into two

42:02.960 --> 42:08.720
states one Arab one Jewish which the Arabs of course rejected a Peel also recommended that the

42:08.720 --> 42:15.360
Arabs most of the Arabs in the Jewish state to be should be transferred because otherwise if they

42:15.360 --> 42:21.360
stayed and were disloyal to the emergent Jewish state this would cause endless disturbances

42:21.360 --> 42:28.720
warfare killing and so on. So Ben Gurion and Weizmann latched onto this proposal by the

42:28.720 --> 42:35.040
most famous American democracy in the world the British democracy when they proposed the idea of

42:35.040 --> 42:41.040
transfer side by side with the idea of partition because it made sense and they said well if the

42:41.040 --> 42:47.600
British say so we should also advocate it but they never actually tried to pass it as Zionist policy

42:47.600 --> 42:53.760
and they fairly quickly stopped even talking about transfer after 1938. So just to clarify

42:53.760 --> 43:02.880
you're saying is that uh 47 was an offensive war not a defensive war by the Arabs yes by the Arabs

43:02.880 --> 43:10.800
yeah and you're also saying that there was never a top-down policy of expulsion yes just to clarify

43:11.360 --> 43:20.640
if I understood you correctly you're making you're making the claim that transfer expulsion and so on

43:20.640 --> 43:28.240
was was in fact a very localized phenomenon resulting resulting from individual land purchases

43:29.840 --> 43:33.680
and that if I understand you correctly you're also making the claim

43:34.320 --> 43:45.360
um that the idea that a Jewish state requires a removal or overwhelming reduction

43:46.080 --> 43:53.040
of the non-Jewish population was if the Arabs are attacking you yes but but that let's say prior to

43:53.040 --> 44:04.000
1947 it would be your claim um that the idea that a significant reduction or wholesale removal

44:04.000 --> 44:09.840
of their population was not part of of Zionist thinking well I I think there's two problems

44:09.840 --> 44:18.240
with that um I think what you're saying about localized uh disputes is correct but I also think

44:18.240 --> 44:28.960
that um uh there is a whole literature that demonstrates um that transfer was envisioned

44:28.960 --> 44:35.840
by Zionist leaders on a much broader scale than simply individual land purchases in other words

44:35.840 --> 44:41.200
it's it went way beyond we need to remove these tenants so that we can farm this land

44:41.760 --> 44:47.440
the idea was we can't have a state where all these Arabs remain and we have to get

44:47.440 --> 44:55.040
rid of them and the second I think impediment to to that view is that long before the UN General

44:55.040 --> 45:02.720
Assembly convened um to address the question of Palestine Palestinian and Arab and other leaders

45:02.720 --> 45:09.600
as well had been warning ad infinitum that the purpose of the Zionist movement is not just to

45:09.600 --> 45:17.760
establish a Jewish state but to establish an exclusivist uh Jewish state and that transfer

45:17.760 --> 45:28.400
forced displacement um uh was fundamental um uh to that uh project and just responding to um uh

45:28.400 --> 45:37.920
sorry was it that but Bonnell or Donnell yeah with a b yeah yeah um you made the point that um uh the

45:38.640 --> 45:45.280
the problem here is that people don't recognize is that the first and last result for the Arabs is

45:45.280 --> 45:54.240
always war I think there's a problem with that I think um you might do well to recall um the 1936

45:54.240 --> 46:00.720
general strike conducted by Palestinians um at the beginning of the revolt which at the time

46:00.800 --> 46:08.320
was the longest recorded uh general strike in history um you may want to consult um the book

46:09.040 --> 46:15.280
published last year by Lori Allen a history of false hope which discusses in great detail

46:16.000 --> 46:22.720
the consistent engagement by Palestinians their leaders their elites their diplomats and so on

46:22.720 --> 46:29.600
with all these international committees if we look at today the Palestinians are once again

46:29.600 --> 46:37.840
going to the international court of justice um they're consistently trying to persuade

46:37.840 --> 46:43.600
the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court to um do his job um they have

46:43.600 --> 46:51.360
launched widespread uh boycott campaigns so of course the Palestinians have engaged in um uh

46:51.360 --> 46:57.120
military resistance but I think the suggestion that this has always been their first and last

46:57.120 --> 47:05.120
resort and that they have somehow spurned civic action spurn diplomacy I I think really has no

47:05.120 --> 47:10.000
basis uh in reality I'll respond to that and then a question for norm to take into account I think

47:10.000 --> 47:14.080
when he answers Benny because I am curious obviously uh I have fresher eyes on this and

47:14.080 --> 47:19.040
I'm a newcomer to this arena versus the three of you guys for sure um a claim that gets brought

47:19.040 --> 47:24.960
up a lot has to do with the inevitability of transfer in Zionism or the idea that as soon as

47:24.960 --> 47:30.080
the Jews envisioned a state in Palestine they knew that it would involve some mass transfer

47:30.080 --> 47:34.640
of population perhaps a mass expulsion um I'm sure we'll talk about plan dial it or plan d at

47:34.640 --> 47:40.480
some point the issue that I run into is while you can find quotes from leaders while you can find

47:40.480 --> 47:45.920
maybe desires expressed in diaries I feel like it's hard to truly ever know if there would have

47:45.920 --> 47:50.960
been mass transfer in the face of Arab peace because I feel like every time there was a huge

47:50.960 --> 47:56.480
deal on the table that would have had a sizable Jewish and Arab population living together the

47:56.480 --> 48:00.720
Arabs would reject it out of hand so for instance when we say that transfer was inevitable when we

48:00.720 --> 48:05.920
say that Zionists would have never accepted you know sizable Arab population how do you explain

48:05.920 --> 48:10.320
the acceptance of the 47 partition plan that would have had a huge Arab population living in

48:10.320 --> 48:14.640
the Jewish state is your contention that after the acceptance of that after the establishment

48:14.640 --> 48:19.360
of that state that Jews would have slowly started to expel all of these Arab citizens from their

48:19.360 --> 48:24.400
country or how do you explain that in Lusanne a couple years later that Israel was willing to

48:24.400 --> 48:31.280
formally annex the Gaza Strip and make 200,000 or so people those citizens but I'm just curious

48:31.280 --> 48:37.520
how how do we get this idea of Zionism always means mass transfer when there were times at

48:37.520 --> 48:41.840
least early on in the history of Israel and a little bit before it where Israel would have

48:41.840 --> 48:46.320
accepted a state that would have had a massive Arab population in it is your yeah is your idea

48:46.320 --> 48:50.240
that they would have just slowly expelled them afterwards or is that question to me or norm

48:50.240 --> 48:56.160
either one i'm just curious for the incorporation of the answer yeah there's some misunderstandings

48:56.160 --> 49:05.360
here so let's try to clarify that number one it was the old historians who would point to the fact

49:05.920 --> 49:11.600
in professor Morris's terminology the old historians what he called not real historians he

49:11.600 --> 49:19.600
called them chroniclers not real historians it was the old israeli historians who denied

49:20.240 --> 49:28.240
the centrality of transfer in zionist thinking it was then professor Morris

49:29.680 --> 49:37.760
who contrary to Israel's history historian establishment who said now you remind me it's

49:37.760 --> 49:42.080
four pages but it came at the end of the book it was no no it's at the beginning of the book

49:42.080 --> 49:48.400
transfer transfer is dealt with in four pages at the beginning of my first book on the refugee

49:48.400 --> 49:52.800
problem it's a fault of my memory but the point still stands it was professor Morris

49:53.600 --> 49:58.960
who introduced this idea in what you might call a big way yeah but i didn't say it was

49:58.960 --> 50:04.960
central to the science science experimental experience you're saying centrality okay i

50:04.960 --> 50:09.520
never said it was central it was there okay idea it's by the way it's okay to respond back and

50:09.520 --> 50:16.080
forth this is great and also just a quick question if i may you're using quotes from from benny from

50:16.080 --> 50:22.480
professor morris uh it's also okay to say those quotes do not reflect that would be fine so like

50:22.480 --> 50:28.960
if we go back if you know two quotes we've said in the past and you've both here have written the

50:28.960 --> 50:34.400
three you have written on this topic a lot is we should be careful and just admit like well yeah

50:34.400 --> 50:39.040
well that's just real quick just to be clear that the contention is that norm is quoting apart and

50:39.040 --> 50:43.440
saying that this was the entire reason for this whereas benny's saying it's a part i'm not quoting

50:43.440 --> 50:55.680
apart i'm quoting 25 pages where professor morris was at great pains to document the claim

50:56.400 --> 51:05.760
that appeared in those early four pages of his book now you say it never became part

51:06.640 --> 51:15.920
of the official zionist platform never became policy fine yeah yeah yeah okay we're also asked

51:15.920 --> 51:21.920
well this is true why did that happen why that happened it's because it's a very simple fact

51:21.920 --> 51:29.840
which everybody understands ideology doesn't operate in a vacuum there are real world

51:29.840 --> 51:38.160
practical problems you can't just take an ideology and superimpose it on a political reality

51:38.800 --> 51:49.040
and turn it into a fact it was the british mandate there was significant arab resistance

51:49.040 --> 51:57.680
to zionism and that resistance was based on the fact as you said the fear of territorial

51:57.680 --> 52:05.840
displacement and dispossession so you couldn't very well expect the zionist movement to come out

52:05.840 --> 52:13.600
in neon lights and announce hey we're going to be expelling you the first chance we get

52:13.600 --> 52:19.120
that's not realistic okay now let me respond look you said you've said it a number of times

52:19.120 --> 52:28.880
that the arabs from fairly early on in the big in the conflict from the 1890s or the early 1900s

52:28.880 --> 52:34.320
said the jews intend to expel us this doesn't mean that it's true it means that some arabs

52:34.320 --> 52:39.920
said this may be believing it was true may be using it as a political instrument to gain support

52:39.920 --> 52:46.320
to mobilize arabs against the zionist experiment but the fact is transfer did not occur before

52:46.320 --> 52:54.560
1947 and arabs later said and then and since then have said that the jews want to build a third

52:54.560 --> 53:00.880
temple on the temple mount as if that's what really the the mainstream of zionism has always

53:00.880 --> 53:06.400
wanted and always strived for but this is nonsense it's something that husseini used to use as a way

53:06.400 --> 53:14.480
to mobilize masses for the cause using religion as as the way to get them to to join join him

53:15.920 --> 53:21.760
the fact that arabs said that they're a zionist wanted this possess us doesn't mean it's true it

53:21.760 --> 53:27.200
just means that there's some arabs thought that maybe and maybe said it sincerely and maybe

53:27.200 --> 53:32.960
insincerely professor maurice later it became a self-fulfilling prophecy this is true because

53:32.960 --> 53:38.720
arabs attacked the jews professor maurice i read through your stuff even yesterday

53:38.720 --> 53:42.800
i was looking through righteous victims you should read other things you're wasting your time

53:42.800 --> 53:48.800
no no actually no i do read other things but i don't consider it a waste of time to read you

53:48.800 --> 53:53.040
not at all um you say that

53:53.040 --> 53:53.120
that

53:56.320 --> 54:02.960
this wasn't inherent in zionism now would you agree that ben gur David Ben-Gurion was a zionist

54:04.000 --> 54:08.800
a zion a major zionist right would you agree Ryan Weitzman was a zionist

54:09.600 --> 54:16.400
okay i believe they were i believe they took their ideology seriously it was the first generation

54:17.280 --> 54:21.760
just like with the bolsheviks the first generation was committed to an idea

54:21.760 --> 54:29.520
by the 1930s it was just pure rail politic the ideology went out the window the first generation

54:29.520 --> 54:38.080
i have no doubt about their convictions okay they were zionists transfer was inevitable and inbuilt

54:38.080 --> 54:44.880
in zionism it keeps repeating the same thing because i have as i said then mr maurice i have

54:44.880 --> 54:54.240
a problem reconciling what you're saying it either was incidental or it was deeply entrenched

54:55.120 --> 55:04.000
here i read it's deeply entrenched two very resonant words inevitable and inbuilt deeply

55:04.000 --> 55:08.240
entrenched i never wrote well i'm not sure it's something you just invented okay but but

55:08.720 --> 55:14.320
in that inevitable and inbuilt the idea okay let me concede fine let me concede something no

55:14.320 --> 55:21.600
the idea of transfer was there israel zangville a british zionist talked about it early on in

55:21.600 --> 55:29.040
the century even hertzel in some way talked about transferring population according to your 25 pages

55:29.040 --> 55:33.920
everybody talked well that's like we keep bringing up this line on the 25 page and the four pages

55:34.720 --> 55:40.160
uh you know we're lucky to have benny in front of us right now we don't need to go to the quotes

55:41.040 --> 55:49.600
like we can legitimately ask how central is expulsion to zionism uh in its early version

55:49.600 --> 55:58.240
of zionism and what whatever zionism is today and how much power uh influence the zionism and

55:58.240 --> 56:05.360
ideology have in israel and like influence the philosophy the ideology of zionism have on israel

56:05.360 --> 56:13.600
today the zionist movement up to 1948 zionist ideology was central to the the whole zionist

56:13.600 --> 56:19.920
experience the whole enterprise up to 1948 and i think zionist ideology was also important

56:20.400 --> 56:30.000
in in the first decades of israel's existence slowly the the the hold of zionism like if you

56:30.000 --> 56:36.640
like like like bolshevism held the soviet union gradually faded and a lot of israelis today think

56:36.640 --> 56:42.320
in terms of individual success and then the capitalism and all sorts of things which are

56:42.320 --> 56:47.440
nothing to do with the zionism but zionism was very important but what i'm saying is that the

56:47.440 --> 56:54.240
idea of transfer wasn't the core of zionism the idea of zionism was to save the jews who had been

56:54.240 --> 57:01.200
vastly persecuted in eastern europe and incidentally in the arab world the muslim world

57:01.200 --> 57:07.120
for centuries and eventually ending up with the holocaust the idea of zionism was to save the

57:07.120 --> 57:12.880
jewish people by establishing a state or reestablishing a jewish state on the ancient

57:12.960 --> 57:18.240
jewish homeland which is something the arabs today even deny that there were jews in palestine or

57:18.240 --> 57:25.200
the land of israel 2000 years ago arafat famously said what temple was there on temple mount maybe

57:25.200 --> 57:31.040
it was in nablus which of course is nonsense but but they had a connection strong connection

57:31.040 --> 57:36.640
for thousands of years to the land to which they wanted to return and return there they found that

57:36.640 --> 57:42.080
on the land lived hundreds of thousands of arabs and the question was how to accommodate the vision

57:42.080 --> 57:49.440
of a jewish state in palestine alongside the existence of these arab masses living on were

57:49.440 --> 57:56.640
indigenous in fact to the land by that stage and the idea of partition because they couldn't live

57:56.640 --> 58:01.040
together because the arabs didn't want to live together with the jews and i think the jews also

58:01.040 --> 58:06.640
didn't want to live together in one state with arabs in general the idea of partition was the

58:06.720 --> 58:13.280
thing which the zionists accepted okay we can we can only get a small part of palestine the arabs

58:13.280 --> 58:22.000
will get in 37 most of palestine in 1947 the ratios were changed but we can we can live side

58:22.000 --> 58:27.680
by side with each other in a partition palestine and this was the essence of it the idea of transfer

58:28.480 --> 58:35.360
it was there but it was never adopted but as policy but in 1947 48 the arabs attacked trying

58:35.360 --> 58:40.720
to destroy essentially the jewish the zionist enterprise and the emergent jewish state and

58:41.680 --> 58:48.400
the reaction was a transfer in some way a not as policy but this is what happened on the battlefield

58:48.400 --> 58:54.480
and this is also what bengurian at some point began to want as well right well you know one

58:54.480 --> 59:02.560
of the first books on this issue i read when i was still in high school because my my late

59:02.560 --> 59:09.920
father had it was a diaries of theodore hurtsell and i think you know theodore hurtsell of course

59:09.920 --> 59:16.480
was was the founder of the contemporary zionist movement and i think if you read that it's very

59:16.480 --> 59:25.440
clear for hurtsell the model upon which the zionist movement would uh would proceed his model was

59:25.440 --> 59:31.840
sessile roads his um i think you know roads from what i recall correct me if i'm wrong

59:31.840 --> 59:39.200
has quite a prominent place in hurtsell's diaries i think hurtsell was also corresponding with him

59:39.200 --> 59:48.400
and seeking his support sessile roads of course was um was the british colonialist after whom

59:48.400 --> 59:57.280
the former white minority regime in uh in rodigia uh was named and hurtsell also says explicitly

59:57.280 --> 01:00:08.080
in his diaries that it is essential um to remove uh the existing population from palestine in a

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:13.040
moment please he says we shall have to spirit the penniless population across the borders and

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.000
procure employment for them elsewhere or something and israel's angle who you mentioned

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.360
a land without a people for a people without a land they knew damn well it wasn't a people

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:30.080
a land without a people um i'll continue but i'll please go ahead just to this there is one small

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:37.120
diary entry in hurtsell's vast it's five volumes yeah five volumes there's one paragraph which

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.760
actually mentions the idea of transfer there are people who i think that hurtsell was actually

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:46.080
pointing to south america when he was talking about that the jews were going to move to

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:53.680
argentina and then they would try and buy out or buy off or spirit the the penniless natives

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.960
to make way for jewish settlement it maybe wasn't even talking about the arabs in that

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:05.200
particular passage that's the argument of some people maybe it was but the point is it it has

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:12.080
only a one hundredth of a one percent of the diary which is devoted to the subject it's not

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:17.600
a central idea in hurtsell in hurtsell's thinking die what hurtsell wanted and this is what's

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:24.720
important not roads i don't think he was the model hurtsell wanted to create a liberal democratic

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:32.560
western state in palestine for the jews that's that was the idea a not some imperial enterprise

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:38.560
serving some imperial master which is what roads was about but to have a jewish state which was

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.000
modeled on the western democracies in in palestine and this incidentally was more or less what

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.120
weitzman and bengurian bengurian wanted they bengurian was more of a socialist weitzman was

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:55.360
more of a liberal a a westerner but they wanted to establish a social democratic or liberal

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.240
state in palestine and they both envisioned through most of the years of their activity

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.720
that there would be an arab minority in that jewish state it's true that bengurian strived

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:12.160
to have as small as possible an arab minority in the jewish state because he knew that if you

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.440
want a jewish majority state that that would be necessary but it's not something which they

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:23.040
were willing to translate into actual policy just a quick pause to mention that for people

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.680
who are not familiar theater hurtsell we're talking about over a century ago and everything

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:33.920
we've been talking about has been mostly 1948 and before yes just one clarification on hurtsell's

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:40.400
diaries i mean the other thing that i recall from those diaries is he was um he was very preoccupied

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:47.360
with in fact getting great power patronage seeing palestine um the jewish state in palestine i think

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:54.160
his words an outpost of civilization against barbarism yes in other words very much um seeing

01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:01.280
his project as a prox as a proxy for western imperialism in the middle east not proxy he

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:06.080
wanted to establish a jewish state which would be independent to get that he hoped that he would

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:12.480
be able to garner support from major imperial power including the including the ottoman sultan

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:20.720
yes he tried to cultivate i just want to respond to a point you made earlier which was that people

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:27.040
expressed their rejection of the partition resolution um on the grounds that it gave

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:33.760
the majority of the of palestine to the jewish community which formed only a third um whereas

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.200
in fact uh if i understood you correctly you're saying the palestinians and the arabs would have

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:44.160
rejected any partition resolution yeah i i think a couple things that one they would have rejected

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:49.360
any two a lot of that land given was in the negev it was pretty terrible land at the time and then

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.080
three the land that would have been partitioned to jews i think would have been um i think i saw

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.200
it was like 500 000 era it would have been 500 000 jews 400 000 arabs i think like 80 000 bedouins

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:04.560
would have been there so the the state would have been i think you raise a valid point um because i

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:12.000
think the palestinians did reject the partition of their homeland in principle and i think the

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:20.080
fact that um the united nations general assembly then awarded the majority of their homeland um

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.920
to the zionist movement only added insult to injury i mean um one doesn't have to sympathize

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:36.000
with the palestinians um to recognize that they have now been a stateless people for 75 years

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:43.760
can you name any country yours for example or yours that would be prepared to give

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:53.760
55 percent 25 percent 10 percent of your country to the palestinians of course not and so um the

01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:00.720
issue was not the existence of jews in palestine they had been there for centuries and of course

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:08.000
they had ties to palestine and particularly to jerusalem and other places going back centuries

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:18.320
if not millennia um but the idea of establishing an exclusively jewish state at the expense of

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:25.040
those who are already living there i think it was right to reject that and i don't think we can look

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:32.000
back now 75 years later and say well you should have accepted losing 55 percent of your homeland

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.200
because you ended up losing 78 percent of it the addition the remaining 22 percent was occupied in

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:45.360
1967 that's that's not how things work yeah and i can i can imagine i can imagine an american

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:53.680
rejecting giving 10 percent of the united states to the palestinians and if that rejection leads

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:58.960
to war and you lose half your country i doubt that 50 years from now you're going to say well

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:05.520
maybe i should have accepted that sure so i like this answer more than what i usually feel like

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.600
i'm hearing when it comes to the palestinian rejection of the 47th petition plan because

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:14.320
sometimes i feel like a weird switch happens to where the arabs in the area are actually presented

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:19.840
as entirely pragmatic people who are simply doing a calculation and saying like well we're losing 55

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:24.000
percent of our land jews are only maybe one third of the people here and we've got 45 and

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.400
no the math doesn't work basically but it wasn't a math problem i think like you said it was a

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.240
matter of principle it was an ideology problem no it was a matter of principle yeah ideologically

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:38.400
driven that that they as a as a people have a right to or entitled to this land that they've

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.000
never actually had an independent state on that they've never had even a guarantee of an independent

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.920
state on that they've never actually ruled that last point is actually not correct because

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:55.680
for all its injustice the mandate system recognized palestine as a class a mandate

01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:01.600
which provisionally recognized the independence of of that territory of what would emerge from

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.640
that territory but not the palestinian it was provisionally recognized but not but the

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.040
the territory itself was but not of the palestinian people to have a right or a guarantee to a

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.040
government that would have was a british mandate of palestine not the british mandate of israel

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.400
the word exclusive which you keep using is nonsense the state which ben gurion envisioned

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:27.920
would be a jewish majority state as they accepted the 1947 partition a resolution as steven said

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:35.680
that included 400 000 plus arabs in a state which would have 500 000 jews so the idea of exclusivity

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:41.760
wasn't anywhere in the air at all among the zionist leaders in 47 48 they wanted a jewish

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:47.200
majority state but were willing to accept a state which had 40 percent arabs that's one point the

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:53.840
second thing is the palestinians may have regarded the land of palestine as their homeland but so did

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:59.520
the jews it was the homeland of the jews as well the problem was the arabs were unable and remain

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:05.360
to this day unable to recognize that for the jews that is their homeland as well and the problem

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:11.280
then is how do you share this homeland either with one bi-national state or separate this

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:17.040
partitioned into two states the problem is that the arabs have always rejected both of these ideas

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:23.680
the homeland belongs to the jews as jews feel as much as it does i think more than for the arabs

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.600
i would say for the jews it's the jewish people i would also real quick i just want for both of

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.720
you guys because i haven't heard these questions answer i really want these questions to be i'm

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:34.640
just so curious how to make sense of them um it was correctly brought up that i believe that

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:39.360
bangurian had um i think schlomo benhamid describes it as an obsession with getting

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:44.080
validation or support from western states um great britain and then a couple decades later

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.880
it becomes explains us who has uh war yeah exactly correct that was one of the major motivators the

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:54.240
idea to work with britain and france on a military operation imperial students but then the question

01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:00.480
again i go back to if that is true if bangurian if the early israel saw themselves as a western

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.280
fashion nation how could we possibly imagine that they would have engaged in the transfer of some

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:10.160
400 000 arabs after accepting the partition plan would that not have completely and totally

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.640
destroyed their legitimacy in the eyes of the entire western world would not have been how not

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:21.840
well first of all i think that that zinus leadership's acceptance of um the partition

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:29.040
resolution um and i think you may have written about this that they accepted it because it

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:36.480
provided international endorsement of the the legitimacy of the principle of jewish statehood

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:43.680
and they didn't accept the borders um and in fact uh later expanded the border second of all

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.720
the borders the borders were expanded in war they accepted the un partition resolution borders and

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.720
all they accepted you can say that some of the zinus deep in their hearts had the the idea that

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.360
maybe at some point they would be able to get more including their most senior leaders who said

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.760
so and i think you've quoted them but they grudgingly accepted what the united nations the

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:08.800
world community had said this is what you're going to get and second of all i mean removing

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:17.600
dark people darker people it's it's it's intrinsic it's intrinsic it's intrinsic to western history

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:25.200
so the idea that americans or brits or the french would have an issue with i mean french had been

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.920
doing it in algeria for decades americans have been doing it in north america for centuries so

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:39.280
how would israel forcibly displacing um palestinians somehow besmirch um israel in

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:47.040
the eyes of the west in the 1944 resolution of the labor party and at the time even birch and russell

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:55.120
was a member of the labor party it endorsed transfer of arabs out of palestine as moines

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:01.680
pointed out that was a deeply entrenched idea in western thinking that there was nothing uh it

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:09.120
doesn't in any way contradict or violate or breach any moral values to displace uh the palestinian

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:18.320
population now i do believe there's a legitimate question had it been the case as you said

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:26.400
professor morris that the zionists wanted to create a happy state with a jewish majority but

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:34.160
a large jewish minority and if by virtue of immigration like in our own country in our own

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:41.120
country given the current trajectories non-whites will become the majority population in our

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.800
the united states quite soon and according to democratic principles we have to accept that

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:54.960
so if that were the case i would say maybe there is an argument that had there been mass

01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:01.360
jewish immigration change the demographic balance in palestine and therefore

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:09.200
uh jews became the majority it can make an argument in the abstract that the indigenous

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:15.040
arab population should have been accepting of that just as whites in the united states quote

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:20.560
unquote whites have to be accepting of the fact that the demographic majority is shifting to

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.520
non-whites in our own country but that's not what zionism was about

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:33.360
i did write my doctoral dissertation on zionism and i don't want to get now bogged down in abstract

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:41.280
ideas but as i suspect you know most theorists of nationalism say there are two kinds of nationalism

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.800
one is a nationalism based on citizenship you become a citizen you're integral to the country

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.880
that's sometimes called political nationalism and then there's another kind of nationalism

01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:03.040
and that says the state should not belong to its citizens it should belong to an ethnic group

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:12.320
each ethnic group should have its own state it's usually called the german romantic idea of

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:22.960
nationalism zionism is squarely in the jewish german romantic idea that was the whole point

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:32.560
of zionism we don't want to be bundists and be one more ethnic minority in russia we don't want

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:46.640
to become citizens and just become a jewish people in england or france we want our own state

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:53.920
like the arabs before we get to the arabs let's get let's stick to the jews for a moment

01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:04.240
or the zionists we want our own state and in that concept of wanting your own state

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:18.080
the minority at best lives on sufferance and at worst gets expelled that's the logic of the

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:28.960
german romantic zionist idea of a state that's why they're zionists now i personally have

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:34.560
shied away from using the word zionism ever since i finished my doctoral dissertation

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:42.720
because that's painful because as i said i don't believe it's the operative ideology today

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:50.160
it's like talking about bolshevism and referring to khrushchev i doubt khrushchev could have

01:14:50.160 --> 01:15:01.200
spelled bolshevik but for the period we're talking about they were zionists they were committed to

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:10.400
their exclusive state with with a minority living on sufferance or at worst expelled

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:20.640
that was their ideology and i really feel there's a problem with your happy vision of these

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:28.240
western democrats like weitzman and they wanted to live peacefully with the arabs weitzman described

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:35.920
the explosion in 1948 as quote the miraculous clearing of the land that doesn't sound like

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:44.880
somebody shedding too many tears at the loss of the indigenous population the

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:50.800
unsufferance i don't agree with i think that's wrong the jewish state came into being in 1948

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.520
it had a population which was 20 arab when it came into being after arab refugees many of them had

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:05.520
become refugees but 20 remained in the country 20 of israel's population at inception in 1949

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:12.320
was arab 80 went missing no no no i was talking about what remained in palestine israel after it

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:20.480
was created the 20 who lived in israel received citizenship and all the rights of israelis except

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:25.840
of course the right to serve in the army which they didn't want to and they have supreme court

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:32.480
justices they have knesset members they enjoyed basically under emergency laws until 1966

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.040
for a period sure they lived under so they didn't immediately no no no actually no no way to say at

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.280
the beginning at the beginning it's not fantasy at the beginning they received citizenship could

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:47.440
vote in elections for their own people and they were put into parliament but in the first years

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:52.800
the israeli and the jewish majority suspected that maybe the arabs would be disloyal because

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.000
they had just tried to destroy the jewish state then they dropped the military government and they

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.720
became fully equal citizens and so if the whole idea was they must have a state without arabs

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:11.680
this didn't happen in 49 and it didn't happen in the sense of why did you say

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:19.520
professor maris yes then why did you say without a population expulsion a jewish state

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.560
would not have been established because the you're missing the first section of that paragraph

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:30.400
which was they were being assaulted by the arabs and as a result a jewish state could

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.960
not have come into being unless there had also been an expulsion of the population which was

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.480
trying to kill norm i'm officially forbidding you referencing that again i think oh second

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:46.240
wait uh we responded to it so the the main point you're making we have to take many of his word is

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:54.240
like there was a war and that's the reason why he made that statement i think just one last point

01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:02.160
on this i i remember reading your book when it first came out and and and reading you know one

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:07.120
incident after the other and and one example after the other and then getting to the conclusion

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:14.240
where you said um uh the nakba was a product of war not design i think we were exactly and i

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:22.160
remember reacting almost in in in shock to that that i felt you had mobilized overwhelming evidence

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:30.320
that it was a product of design not war and i think our discussion today very much uh reflects

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:35.680
let's say the dissonance uh between the evidence and the conclusion you don't feel

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:44.640
that that the um uh the research that you have conducted and published demonstrates that it was

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:53.200
in fact um inherent and inbuilt and inevitable um and i think the point that norm and i are making

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:59.440
is is that your own historical research together with that of others indisputably demonstrates

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.360
that it does i think that's a fundamental disagreement we're having here can i wait yeah

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.360
can i actually respond to that because this is actually uh i think this is emblematic of the

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.880
entire conversation um i watched a lot of norm's interviews uh and conversations in preparation

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.120
for this and i hear normal say this all over and over and over again i only deal in facts i don't

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.760
deal in hypotheticals i only deal in facts i only deal in facts and that seems to be the case except

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.120
for when the facts are completely and totally contrary to the particular point you're trying

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:31.440
to push the idea that jews would have out of hand rejected any state that had arabs on it or always

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:35.520
had a plan of expulsion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the 47 partition i don't think you

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:46.240
understand politics did i just say that there is a chasm that separates your ideology from the limits

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:57.440
and constraints imposed by politics and reality now professor morris i suspect would agree

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:05.840
that the zionist movement from fairly early on was committed to the idea of a jewish state

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:14.480
i am aware of only one major study probably written 40 years ago the i the bi-national idea

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:21.200
in mandatory palestine by a woman i forgot her name now you remember her i'm trying yeah okay

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:29.280
would you know the book yeah she is the only one who tried to persuasively argue that the zionist

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:38.240
movement was actually not formally actually committed to the bi-national idea but most

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:45.120
historians of the subject agree the zionist movement was committed to the idea of a jewish

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:52.800
state having written my doctoral dissertation on the topic i was confirmed in that idea because

01:20:52.800 --> 01:21:00.080
professor chomsky who was my closest friend for about 40 years was very committed to the idea that

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:06.560
bi-nationalism was the dominant trend in zionism i could not agree with i couldn't go with him there

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:14.160
but professor morris you are aware that until the biltmore resolution in 1942

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:22.640
the zionist movement never declared it was for a jewish state why because it was politically

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:31.440
impossible at the moment until 1942 there is your ideology there are your convictions there are your

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:39.840
operative plans and there's also separately what you say in public the zionist movement couldn't

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:46.160
say in public we're expelling all the arabs they can't say that and they couldn't even say

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:54.720
we support a jewish state until 1942 you're conflating two things the the zionists wanted

01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:00.800
a jewish state correct that didn't mean expulsion of the arabs it's not the same thing they wanted

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:05.920
a jewish state with a jewish majority but they were willing as it turned out both in 37 and in

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:14.880
40 47 and subsequently to have an arab minority a large a large arab minority they were willing

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:20.080
to have a large arab minority in the country and they ended up with a large arab minority in the

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:27.360
country 20 of the population in 49 and it still ended up for about five minutes before they were

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:34.720
expelled they agreed to it until 47 and then they were gone by march 1949 what happened in

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:39.280
between the rejection of the partition plan and the expulsion of the arabs the arabs launched a

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:43.520
war well yeah well i mean like it's not it wasn't random like there's a potential that it wasn't

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.720
random there was totally agree with that it was by design you can say that you can say that but in

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.840
this case the facts betray you there was no arab acceptance of anything that would have allowed for

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.320
a jewish state to exist of course number one and number two i think that it's entirely possible

01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:03.040
given how things happen after war that this exact same conflict could have played out and an

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:07.600
expulsion would have happened without any ideology at play that there was a people that disagreed on

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.280
who had territorial rights to a land there was a massive war afterwards and then a bunch of their

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:15.840
friends invaded after to reinforce the idea that the jewish people in this case couldn't have a

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:21.920
state there could have been a transfer regardless anything could have been that's not what history

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.880
is about history is about palestinian rejection is up to any peace deal as i said over and over

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:36.400
when the war was thrown into the court of the united nations they were faced with a practical

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:44.960
problem and i for one am not going to try to adjudicate the rights and wrongs from the beginning

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:52.160
i do not believe that if territorial displacement and dispossession was

01:23:52.160 --> 01:24:00.800
inherent in the zionist project i do not believe it can be a legitimate political enterprise

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:10.880
now you might say that's speaking from 2022 or 2024 okay but we have to recognize

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:21.600
that from nearly the beginning for perfectly obvious reasons having nothing to do with

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:31.520
anti-semitism anti-westernism anti-europeanism but because no people that i am aware of

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:44.960
would voluntarily cede its country you can perfectly understand native american resistance

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:52.080
to euro colonialism you can perfectly well understand it without any anti-europeanism

01:24:52.080 --> 01:25:00.160
anti-whiteism anti-christianism they didn't want to cede their country to invaders that's completely

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:07.280
understandable minimizing the anti-semitic element you minimize in arab and all your books you

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:14.240
minimize no no no the husseini was an anti-semit the leader of the palestinian national movement

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:19.600
in the 30s and 40s was an anti-semit this was one of the things which drove him and also drove him

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:26.080
in the end to work in berlin for him for four years with nazi giving nazi propaganda to the

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.800
arab world calling on the arabs to murder the jews that's what he did in world war two that's

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:36.000
the leader of the palestinian arab national movement and he wasn't alone he wasn't alone

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:44.960
why is it if you read your book righteous victims you can read it and read it and read it and read

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:53.200
it as i have you will find barely a word about the arabs being motivated by anti-semitism

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:59.360
it exists even i didn't say it doesn't exist agree that it exists hey i don't know a single

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:03.920
non-jew who doesn't harbor anti-semitic we're talking about arabs now yeah but i don't know

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:11.760
anybody that's just part of the human condition anti-semitism i was saying he was a and among the

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:18.800
arabs so professor marz here's my problem i didn't see that in your righteous victims

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.200
even when you talked about the first interfather and you talked about the second interfather

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:31.840
and you talked about how there was a lot of influence by hamas the islamic movement you

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:38.240
even stated that there is a lot of anti-semitism in those movements but then you went on to say

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:47.440
but of course at bottom it was about the occupation it wasn't about and i've read it yeah you'll be

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:54.560
moving from different no i'm not ages across the ages your whole book the occupation began in 67

01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:00.480
the one you're talking about i looked and looked and looked for evidence of this anti-semitism as

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:07.440
being a chief motor of arab resistance to power uh zionism i didn't see it you like did he make

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:11.920
that claim i don't remember the word chief yeah it's it's a one of the elements very binary

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:19.360
one of the elements yes binary please don't give me this post-modernism binary you're the one

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.320
you are thinking in terms of you're the one that said the chief motor do you have your book here

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:32.000
talk about page 137 you're talking in black and white concepts when history is much grayer lots

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.360
of things happen because of lots of reasons not one or the other and and you don't you don't seem

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:41.040
to see that can i ask you quite because it's for them to talk to just two very quick question what

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:46.240
was what do you think the ideal solution was on the arab side from 47 what would they have preferred

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:49.440
and what would have happened and then the second one what would have happened if jews would have

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.640
lost the war in 48 what do you think would have happened to the israeli population i think the

01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:03.760
palestinians and the arabs uh were explicit that they wanted a unitary i think federal uh state

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:12.720
and and they made their submissions to uh they made their um appeals at the un general assembly

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.760
what do you mean by unitarian federal i don't get that they wanted an arab state they wanted

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:23.680
palestine to be an arab state yes yes but without the word unitary federal they wanted palestine

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.280
as an arab and exclusively arab state no it wasn't no it wasn't an exclusively arab state i think we

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:36.640
have to distinguish between palestinian and arab opposition to a jewish state in palestine on the

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:44.800
one hand and um palestinian and arab attitudes to um jewish existence in palestine there's a

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:51.200
fundamental difference the leader of the movement said that all the jews would come since 1917

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:57.520
and that's the majority of the jews in palestine in 1947 shouldn't be there well he didn't be

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:04.160
citizens and he shouldn't be there he did say that yes of course it's true i can understand

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:11.920
the sentiment but i think it's wrong but also you guys you guys said the words earlier that it was

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:17.520
supremacy and exclusivity that the zionist i want to answer your question um as you said he did say

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:24.720
that and i'm sure there was a very substantial uh body of palestinian arab public opinion that

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:34.720
endorsed that um but by the same token i think um a unitary arab state as you call it or a

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:43.440
palestinian state could have been established with arrangements with guarantees um to ensure the

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:51.200
security and rights of of both communities how that would work in detail had had been um uh

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:59.360
discussed and proposed but never uh resolved and again i think you know jewish fears about

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:03.280
what would have happened second holocaust that's what well no i think that was the jewish fear

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:09.200
a second holocaust that that may well have been the jewish fear it was an unfounded uh jewish fear

01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:14.320
it was unfounded of course it was unfounded what about like in 48 and you really you really think

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:18.960
you really think that the palestinians had they won the war were going to import

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:24.160
ovens and crematoria from germany but there were programs across in almost every single arab

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:29.920
state where there were jews living after after 48 after 56 after 67 there were always programs there

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:33.520
were always flights from jews from those countries to israel afterwards i don't think it would be i

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:39.200
wouldn't i wouldn't say there were always programs in every arab state i think there was flight of of

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:46.960
um uh arab jews for multiple reasons in some cases for precisely the reasons you say if you look at

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:53.360
the jewish community in algeria for example their flight had virtually nothing to do with um uh the

01:30:53.360 --> 01:31:00.720
arab israeli conflict the issue of of algerian jews was that the french gave them citizenship

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:06.800
during their colonial rule of algeria and they increasingly became identified uh with french

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:15.680
rule and when algeria became independent and um all the french um ended up uh uh leaving out of

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:22.240
fear or out of disappointment or out of whatever um the jews were identified as french rather than

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:27.760
algerian this is a bit of a red herring there were pogroms in the arab countries in bahrain even where

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:33.840
there's almost no jews there was a program in 1947 there was a program in aleppo in 1947

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:40.720
i'm not denying any of that history killings of jews in iraq and egypt i'm not 1948 49 i'm not

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:47.040
so the arabs the jews basically fled the arab states not for multiple reasons they fled because

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:51.840
they felt that the governments there and the societies amidst amid which they had lived

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:56.560
for hundreds of years no longer wanted them look without without getting into the details i think

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:04.640
we can both agree that ultimately a clear majority of arab jews who believed that after having lived

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:13.360
in these countries for centuries for centuries for centuries for centuries in iraq for centuries

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:18.880
if not millennia um came to the unfortunate conclusion that their situation had become

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:26.640
untenable yes um i also think um that we can both agree that this had never been an issue

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:32.560
prior to zionism and the emergence of the state of israel look i'm not didn't begin with zionism

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:39.200
in the arab world the issue is is is the point i raised which is whether these communities

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:46.320
had ever come to a collective conclusion that their position had become untenable in this part

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.640
of the world no they were arab jews well because untenable meant there was no alternative but with

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.400
the creation of israel there was an alternative right a place where they could go and not be

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:59.120
discriminated against or live as second-class citizens or be subject to arab majority states

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:03.360
i also think it's interesting that like when you analyze the um the flight of jewish people

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.720
and i've seen this that there it's not it wasn't just i agree with you it wasn't just a mass

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:09.840
expulsion from all the arab states there were definitely push factors there were also pull

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.000
factors now i don't know how you guys feel about the nakba but when the analysis the nakba comes

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.440
in again it's back to that well that was actually just a top-down expulsion um you know the retreat

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.920
of wealthy arab people in the 30s didn't matter any of the messaging from the surrounding arab

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:28.800
states didn't matter it was just an expulsion from jewish people or people running from their

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:33.680
lives from jewish massacres um again it's like that i feel like that's selective it's a selective

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:39.920
critical analysis of the term jewish here because it wasn't the you know the jews of england or the

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:49.920
soviet jewish i think we should i think it's useful to to say um refer to zionists before 1948

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.520
and israelis after 48 we don't need to implicate well sure but the jewish people that were being

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.760
attacked in arab states weren't zionists they were just she was living there right just comment on

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:08.000
that i was uh rereading uh shlomo bin ami's last book and he does at the end discuss at some length

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.280
the whole issue of the refugee question bearing on the so-called peace process and on the question

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:21.280
of 48 and the arab emigration if you allow me let me just quote him israel is particularly fond

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.960
of the awkwardly false symmetry she makes between the palestinian refugee crisis

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:35.840
and the forced emigration of 600 000 jews from arab countries following the creation

01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:42.880
of the state of israel as if it were quote an unplanned exchange of unpopulations unquote

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.280
and then mr ben ami for those of you who are listening he was israel's former

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.440
foreign minister and he's an influential historian in his own right he says in fact

01:34:54.400 --> 01:35:02.000
envoys from the mosad and the jewish agency worked underground in arab countries

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:12.640
and iran to encourage jews to go to israel more importantly for many jews in arab states

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:20.160
the very possibility of emigrating to israel was the culmination of millennial

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:28.080
aspirations it represented the consummation of a dream to take part in israel's resurgence

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:38.240
as a nation so this idea that they were all expelled after 1948 it's that's one area

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:44.640
professor maurice i defer to expertise that's one of my credos in life i don't know the israeli

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:52.400
literature but as it's been translated in english there's very little solid scholarship on what

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:58.880
happened in 1948 in the arab countries and which caused the jews to leave arab jews an arab jews

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:05.600
right uh but uh shlomo ben ami knows the literature he knows the scholarship he also

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:13.200
has stories from iraq and is written on this issue and they wrote that the jews in the arab

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.960
lands were not pro-zionist they weren't zionists at all so certainly abhi schleim's family was

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:24.240
anti-zion and abhi schleim when he was interviewed by merrin rappaport on this question he said

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:30.000
you simply cannot say that the iraqi jews were expelled it's just not true and he was speaking

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000
as an iraqi jew who left with his father and family in 1948 they were pushed out they weren't

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.640
expelled that's probably the right phrase i think i think it's more complex than than that i think

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:47.120
it was sorry i interrupted you no you're not interrupting me because i don't know i i only

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:54.240
know what's been translated into english and the english literature on the subject is very small

01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:01.360
and not scholarly now there may be an uh hebrew literature i don't know but i was surprised that

01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:09.680
even shlomo ben ami a stalwart of his state fair enough on this particular point he called it false

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:15.280
symmetry no no steven is right there was a pull and push mechanism in the departure of the jews

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:21.520
from the arab lands post 48 but there was also a lot of push a lot of that's that's indisputable

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:28.240
and on the point of agreement let us on this one brief light of agreement let us wrap up

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:36.720
with this uh topic of history and move on to modern day but before that i'm wondering if uh

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:42.800
we could just say a couple of last words on this topic steven yeah i think that when you look at

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:49.920
the behaviors of both parties uh in in the time period around 48 or especially 48 and earlier

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.800
there's this assumption that there was this huge built-in mechanism of zionism and that it was

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:59.840
going to be inevitable from the inception of the first zionist thought i i guess that appeared in

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:05.440
herzl's mind that there would be a mass violent population transfer of arab palestinians out of

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.880
what would become the israeli state i understand that there are some quotes that we can find that

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:15.360
maybe seem to possibly support an idea that looks close to that but i think when you actually

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.240
consult the record of what happened when you look at the populations the massive populations

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:25.040
that israel was willing to accept within what would become their state borders their nation

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.520
borders i just don't think that the historical record agrees with the idea that zionists would

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:36.000
have just never been okay living alongside arab palestinians but when you look at the other side

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.680
arabs would out of hand reject literally any deal that apportioned any amount of that land

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:46.240
for any state relating to jewish people or the israeli people i think it was said even on the

01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.160
other end of the table that arab palestinians would have never accepted the arabs would have

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:55.280
never accepted any jewish state whatsoever so it's interesting that on the ideology part

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:59.520
where it's claimed that zionists are people of exclusion and supremacy and expulsion

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.040
we can find that in diary entries but we can find that expressed very real terms on the arab side

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.280
i think in all of their behavior around 48 and earlier where the goal was the destruction of

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:12.880
the israeli state it would have been the dispossession of many jewish people it probably

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:16.640
would have been the expulsion of a lot of them back to europe and i think that very clearly plays

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.320
out in the difference between the actions of the arabs versus some diary entries of some jewish

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:28.160
leaders benny well one thing which stood out and i think muin made this point is that the arabs had

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.360
nothing to do with the holocaust but then the world community forced the arabs to pay the price

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:40.560
for the holocaust that's the traditional arab argument this is slightly distorting the reality

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:47.520
the arabs in the 1930s did their utmost to prevent jewish emigration from europe

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:52.880
and reaching palestine which was the only safe haven available because america britain france

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.440
nobody wanted jews anywhere and they were being persecuted in central europe and eventually would

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:04.800
be massacred in large numbers so the arab effort to pressure the british to prevent jews reaching

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:11.840
palestine's safe shores contributed indirectly to the slaughter of many jews in europe because

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:15.840
they couldn't get to anywhere and they couldn't get to palestine because the arabs were busy

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:20.880
attacking jews in palestine and attacking the british to make sure they didn't allow jews to

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:27.040
reach the safe haven that's important the second thing is of course there's no point in belittling

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:31.680
the fact that the arab palestinian arab national movement's leader

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:39.440
husseini worked for the nazis in the 1940s he got a salary from the german foreign ministry he raised

01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:46.880
troops among muslims in bosnia for the ss and he broadcast to the arab world calling for the murder

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:52.400
of the jews in the middle east this is what he did and the arabs since then have been trying to

01:40:52.400 --> 01:41:00.240
whitewash and husseini's role and not saying he was the instigator of the holocaust but he did

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:07.840
he helped helped the arab the germans along in in doing what they were doing and and supported

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:14.160
them in doing that so this can't be removed from the fact that the arabs as you say paid a price

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:21.840
for the holocaust but they also participated in various ways in helping it happen right i'll make

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:30.400
two points um the first is um you mentioned hajj amin al-husseini and his uh collaboration with

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:39.120
the nazis entirely legitimate point to raise but i think one can also say definitively had hajj

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:46.080
amin al-husseini never existed the holocaust would have played out precisely certainly as it did

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:54.240
as far as um palestinian opposition to jewish immigration to palestine during the 1930s is

01:41:54.240 --> 01:42:03.040
concerned it was of a different character than for example british and american um rejection of

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.320
jewish immigration they just didn't want jews on their soil objectively it helped the germans kill

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:13.920
the jews in the palestinian case their opposition to jewish immigration was to prevent the

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:19.360
transformation of their homeland into a jewish state that would dispossess them and i think

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:25.840
that's an important distinction to make um the other point i wanted to make is we've we've spent

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:32.320
the past several hours talking about uh zionism transfer and so on but i think there's a

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:41.840
more fundamental aspect to this which is that zionism i think would have emerged and disappeared

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:50.160
as yet one more utopian political project had it not been for the british what the preeminent

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:56.560
palestinian historian waleed khalidi has termed the british shield because i think without the

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:06.880
british sponsorship we wouldn't be having this discussion today the british sponsored zionism

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:12.240
for a very simple reason which is that during world war one the ottoman armies attempted to

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:22.160
march on the suez canal suez canal was the jugular vein of the british empire you know between europe

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:30.080
and india and the british came to the conclusion that they needed to secure the suez canal from

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:36.080
any threat and as the british have done so often in so many places how do you deal with this well

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:45.280
you know you you bring in a foreign minority implant them amongst a hostile population and

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:52.800
establish a protectorate over them i don't think um a jewish state in palestine had been part of

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:58.560
british intentions and the belphor declaration very specifically speaks about a jewish national

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:04.960
home in palestine in other words a british protectorate things ended up taking a different

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:13.680
course and i think the the most important development was world war two and i think

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:19.760
this had maybe less to do with the holocaust and more to do with the effective bankruptcy

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:27.120
of the united kingdom during that war and its inability to sustain its global empire it ended

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:34.640
up giving up india ended up giving up palestine and it's in that context i think that we need

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:43.520
to see the emergence of a of a jewish state in palestine and again a jewish state means a state

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:53.680
in which the jewish community enjoys not only a demographic majority but an uncontestable

01:44:53.680 --> 01:45:03.680
demographic majority an uncontestable territorial hegemony and uncontestable political supremacy

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:11.440
and that is also why after 1948 the nascent israeli state confiscated i believe up to 90

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:20.880
of lands that had been previously owned by palestinians who became citizens of israel

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:29.200
it is why the new israeli state imposed a military government on its population of

01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:38.640
palestinian citizens between 1948 and 1966 it is why the israeli state effectively

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:46.800
reduced the palestinians living within the israeli state as citizens of the israeli state

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:53.760
to second-class citizens on the one hand promoting jewish nationalism and jewish nationalist parties

01:45:53.760 --> 01:46:00.000
on the other hand doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate palestinian or

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:07.120
arab nationalist movements and that's why today there's a consensus among all major human rights

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:14.000
organizations that israel is an apartheid state what the israeli human rights organization

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.560
betselem describes a regime of jewish supremacy between the river and the sea you're really

01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:27.280
tempting a response from the other side on the last few sentences we'll talk about the claims of

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:33.520
apartheid and so on it's a fascinating discussion we need to have it uh norm on the question of

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:40.400
the responsibility of the palestinian arabists for the nazi holocaust direct or indirect

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:50.720
i consider that an absurd claim uh as gromiko said and i quoted him the entire western world

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:58.160
turned its back on the jews to somehow focus on the palestinian strikes me as completely

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:07.360
ridiculous number two as maween said there's a perfectly understandable reason why

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:14.640
palestinian arabs wouldn't want jews because in their minds and not irrationally these jews

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:20.640
intended to create a jewish state which would quite likely have resulted in their expulsion

01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:26.960
i'm a very generous person i've actually taken in a homeless person for two and a half years

01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:35.040
but if i knew in advance that that homeless person was going to try to turn me out of my apartment

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.040
i would think 10 000 times before i took him in

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:49.920
okay as far as the actual complicity of the palestinian arabs if you look at

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.920
raoul hilberg's three volume classic work the destruction of the european jury

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:06.800
he has in those thousand plus pages one sentence one sentence on the role of the mufti of jerusalem

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:13.280
and that i think is probably an overstatement but we'll leave it aside the only two points i would

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:19.920
make aside from the holocaust point is number one i do think the transfer discussion is useful

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:29.040
because it indicates that there was a rational reason behind the arab resistance to jewish or

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:35.360
zionist immigration to palestine the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:46.160
and number two there are two issues one is the history and the second is being responsible for

01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:54.000
your words now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly and they're advised on youtube to

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:01.520
turn up the speed twice to three times whenever i'm on one of the reasons i speak slowly is because

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:12.800
i attach value to every word i say and it is discomforting disorienting where you have a

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:27.840
person who's produced a voluminous corpus rich in insight and rich in archival sources who seems

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:36.320
to disown each and every word that you pluck from that corpus by claiming that it's either

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:46.640
out of context or it's cherry picking words count and i agree with lex everybody has the

01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:54.800
right to rescind what they've said in the past but what you cannot claim is that you didn't say

01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:03.120
what you said i'll stick to the history not the current propaganda 1917 the british

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:09.840
the zionist movement began way before the british supported the zionist movement for decades in 1917

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:15.440
the british jumped in and issued the balfour declaration supporting the emergence of a jewish

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:20.400
national home in palestine which most people understood to mean eventual jewish statehood

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:26.240
in palestine most people understood that in britain and in his among the zionists and among the arabs

01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:32.880
but the british declared the balfour declaration or issued the balfour declaration not only because

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:38.000
of imperial self-interest and this is a what you're basically saying they had the imperial

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.360
interests a buffer state which would protect the sewers canal from the east the british also

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:49.920
were motivated by idealism and this incidentally is how balfour described the reasoning behind

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:56.240
issuing the declaration and he said the western world western christendom owes the jews a great

01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:04.000
debt both for giving the world and the west if you like a value social values as as embodied

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:10.640
in the the bible and social justice and all sorts of other things and the christian world owes the

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:16.720
jews because it persecuted them for two thousand years this debt we're now beginning to repay

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:24.160
with the 1917 declaration favoring zionism but it's also worth remembering that the jews

01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:32.000
weren't proxies or attached to the british a imperial endeavor they were happy to receive

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:39.680
british support in 1917 and then subsequently when the british ruled palestine for 20 30 years

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:46.640
but they weren't part of the british imperial design or mission they wanted a state for

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:51.920
themselves the jews happy to have the british support them happy today to have the americans

01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:57.200
support israel but it's not because we're stooges or extensions of american imperial

01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:04.320
interests the british incidentally always described in arab narratives or propaganda as

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:11.360
consistent supporters of zionism they weren't the first british rulers in palestine 1917 1920

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:16.960
herbert samuel no before herbert samuel samuel came in 1920 the british ruled there for three

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:22.480
years previously and most of the leaders the british generals and so on who were in palestine

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:27.280
were anti-zionist and subsequently in the 20s and 30s the british occasionally

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:34.880
curbed zionist immigration to palestine in 1939 switched horses and supported the arab national

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:40.800
movement and not zionism they turned anti-zionist and basically said you arabs will rule palestine

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:46.000
within the next 10 years this is what we're giving you by limiting jewish immigration to palestine

01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.280
but the arabs didn't actually understand what they were being given on the silver platter

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:57.120
husseini again and he said no no we can't accept the british white paper of may 1939 which had

01:52:57.120 --> 01:53:02.880
given the arabs everything they wanted basically self-determination in an arab majority state so

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:10.240
what i'm saying is the british at some point did support the zionist enterprise but at other points

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:16.480
were less consistent in the support and in 1939 until 1948 when they didn't vote even for

01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:22.480
partition for jewish statehood in palestine in the un resolution they didn't support zionism

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:27.360
during the last decade of the mandate it's worth remembering that i'd like to respond to that i

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:38.480
mean speaking of propaganda i find it simply impossible to accept that balfour who as british

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:46.240
prime minister in 1905 was a chief sponsor of the aliens act which was specifically changed his

01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:53.120
mind which was specifically designed to keep persecuted eastern european jews out of the

01:53:53.120 --> 01:54:00.800
streets of the uk and who was denounced as an anti-semite by the entire british jewish establishment

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:06.640
a decade later all of a sudden changed his mind this people change their minds

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:15.360
but when the when when when the changing of the mind just coincidentally happens to coincide

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:22.800
with the british imperial interest i think perhaps the transformation is is is a little

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:30.320
more superficial than he's being given credit for it was clearly a british imperial venture

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:37.520
and if there had been no threat to the suez canal during world war one regardless of what balfour

01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.560
would have thought about the jews and their contribution to history and their and their

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.320
persecution and so on there would have been no balfour declaration real quick is a question on

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:53.360
that why did the british ever cap immigration then from jews to that area at all well we're talking

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.000
now about 23rd sure but i'm saying that if it was if the whole goal was just to be an imperialist

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.520
project like there were terrorist attacks from jewish uh yes but you're talking i'll answer you

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:10.720
yeah in the 40s yeah and we're talking now about 1917 and and as i mentioned earlier i don't think

01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:16.000
the british had a jewish state in mind that's why they used the term jewish national home i

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:24.880
think what they wanted was a british protectorate loyal to and dependent upon uh the british i think

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:31.040
an outstanding review of british policy towards these issues during the mandate has been done by

01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:38.160
martin bunton of the university of victoria and and he basically makes the argument

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:46.720
that once the british realized the mess they were in certainly by the late 20s early 30s

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:53.840
they they recognized these the mess they were in the irreconcilable differences

01:55:53.920 --> 01:56:00.880
and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on um and and um and muddling on

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:08.160
in the context of british rule in palestine um whose overall purpose was to serve

01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:17.360
for the development of of zionist institutions uh yeshuv's economy and so on meant even if the

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.760
british were not self-consciously doing this um preparing the groundwork for the eventual

01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.520
establishment of a jewish state i don't know if that answers your question except they did turn

01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:32.800
anti-zionist 1939 yes of course and maintained they were being shot off and maintained that

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:38.400
zionist no no before they were being shot off but maintained that anti-zionist posture until 1948

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:45.600
okay and and if i may just also one point um you mentioned hajamina hosseini during a world entirely

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:53.200
legitimate um but what i but what i would also point point out is that you had a zionist

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:59.120
organization um the lehi 300 people 300 people one of whom happened to become an

01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.040
israeli prime minister an israeli foreign minister a speaker of israeli parliament

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:11.600
um you should give his name yichak shamir uh proposing an alliance with nazi germany

01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:19.040
in 1941 shamir well no the lehi proposed some people in the lehi proposed of which shamir was

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:26.480
a prominent leader no no okay well if he's a red herring uh has been is a red whale i'm sorry

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:32.640
the lehi was an unimportant organization in the yishuv 300 people versus 30 000 belonged to the

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:38.000
hagana so it was not a very important organization it's true before the holocaust actually began

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.040
they wanted allies against the british where they could we're talking 1941 here not 1931

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:49.520
41 from what i recall 1940 they were they approached the german emissary in istanbul

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:58.160
yes and and and if i may proposed an alliance with nazi germany on what the lehi described

01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:04.240
is on the basis of shared ideology shared ideological principles well they said they

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:09.680
did no they they were vile why are you doing these things of course they said you know the

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:16.560
state but you know that you know what the statement said on the basis of a shared ideology

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.880
why do you say no do you think that the lehi wait the lehi people were nazis is that what you're

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:27.520
saying they said no you're saying that forget statements you like to quote things but were

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:33.920
they were they nazis were the lehi nazis that's what i'm asking what did he some of them supported

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:39.200
he's saying that the basis of the pack was their agreement on ideology there wasn't any pack they

01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:44.160
suggested i said they proposed an agreement right and what did the agreement say they wanted arms

01:58:44.160 --> 01:58:48.320
against the british that's what they wanted yeah well that's what hajamina hosseini wanted also

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:54.240
that's what no no but others in india people didn't work in berlin helping the nazi regime

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:59.120
i mean it's what the ira wanted also no but this is what hajamina hosseini did you know that he

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:04.800
was an anti-semite you you've probably read some of his works yeah it wasn't just anti-british and

01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:10.160
he was also anti-semitic and and so he had a common ground with hitler i think i think we can agree

01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:15.920
every anti-semite is a hitler i i think that part he literally worked with the nazis to recruit

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:23.280
people he wasn't just a guy posting or absolutely revolting disgusting human being this i'm happy

01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:28.960
no but the problem is you're you're saying i don't believe that you're saying the move but i i don't

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:36.560
even understand of all the crimes you want to ascribe to the palestinian people trying to blame

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:44.000
them directly indirectly indirectly or indirectly three times removed for the nazi holocaust is

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.120
completely lunatic the way there's not a he's not blaming them for the holocaust he's saying that

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:53.440
from the perspective oh no he's saying that from the perspective of jews in the region

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:57.920
palestinians would have been part of the region that is exactly what he said i've read him you

01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:03.360
read and understand him he's sitting right here believe me i'm a lot more literate than you mr

02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:07.280
bereli i'm gonna believe the guy that wrote the stuff wikipedia says that's great and you

02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:11.200
would even speak hebrew and you call yourself an israeli historian we're all here on different

02:00:11.200 --> 02:00:15.040
grounds okay i just want if i can just respond well no no i'm just saying that the there were

02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:19.040
there were two tricks they were that's fine there were two tricks that are being played here that

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:22.800
i think is interesting one is you guys claim that the lehi was trying to forge an alliance

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:26.800
with nazi germany because of a shared ideology that's what they said yeah but hold on no no no

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:32.880
wait no no it's about what you said you brought that up to imply that zionism must be inexorably

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:38.560
linked no i'm sorry no you're putting words in my mouth okay wait well then what was the purpose of

02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:42.640
saying that the lehi claimed that they the lehi who were small group of people that were reviled

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:47.120
by many in israel and not many by everybody practically they were called terrorists so

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:52.160
reviled the zionist movement called them terrorists yes yes and a hundred them and a hundred shared

02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:58.080
ideology called himself a terrorist they were so irrelevant that their leader ended up being

02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.720
kicked upstairs to the leader of the israeli parliament that's israeli politics to the israeli

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:08.080
to israeli foreign minister and beguine was also yes you want to you want to characterize him as

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.760
irrelevant as well go ahead no characterism is relevant or irrelevant based on what happens

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:16.240
decades later the timeline matters well the question is what is the point of saying that

02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:22.960
the lehi tried to forge in a line why why is why is why is relevant is bringing up the mufti of

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:30.480
jerusalem and trying to blame the holocaust no no the mufti was the leader of the palestine arab

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:37.440
national movement he was 300 and he had as much to do with the nazi holocaust as i did no he recruited

02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:42.720
people for the ss how can you get away from that he recruited people for the ss he recruited

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:49.440
soldiers in the balkans mostly kosovars which was disgusting i have no doubt about that but he had

02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:57.840
he also wrote letters to foreign ministers saying don't let the jews out i knew ronald hilton

02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:03.600
received letters from juseni during during the holocaust during the holocaust don't let the jews

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:08.640
out don't let the jews out i'm not saying he was a major architect he wasn't even minor

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:16.160
but if we're agreed if we're agreed that hajj amin al hussaini the mufti of jerusalem

02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:21.760
collaborated with the nazis during world war two and actively sought their sponsorship

02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:26.960
why is it irrelevant and probably wanted the destruction of european jewelry he probably

02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:34.800
wanted a lot of things okay okay if that's relevant why is it irrelevant that a prime

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:40.880
minister of israel not prime minister in 1940 41 he wasn't prime minister of israel he was a leader

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.920
of a very small terrorist group so do you consider it as terrorist by the mainstream of zionism do

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:52.080
you consider it irrelevant that many years ago mahmoud abbas wrote a doctoral thesis which is

02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:56.080
basically tantamount about mahmoud abbas okay but i don't but didn't bring it up you're the

02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.320
one who's bringing it up but you wrote things belittling the holocaust that's what you're saying

02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:05.040
the president president of the palestinian national authority belittle the holocaust

02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:10.080
and it didn't happen or only a few jews i think that's a fair characterization of but i didn't

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:16.960
bring it up i brought it up yeah okay because my question is then why is shamir's antecedency

02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:23.840
relevant he was a terrorist leader of a very small marginal group who became he was the head

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:28.880
of the movement at the time also the point of bringing up the point of bringing up husseini

02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:32.960
stuff wasn't to say that he was a great further of the holocaust it's that he might have been a

02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:37.840
great further in the prevention of jews fleeing to go to palestine to escape the holocaust that

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:47.040
and i explained why i think um that's that's not an entirely um accurate characterization

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:52.160
but and then i wanted to make another point if it's legitimate to bring up his role during

02:03:52.160 --> 02:04:00.240
world war two why is it illegitimate to bring up a man who would become israel's speaker of

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:07.360
parliament foreign minister yes why is it and and also he was young and was also responsible

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:15.200
for the murder of of the united nations his first international envoy bernadotti folky bernadotti

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:19.920
why is all that irrelevant i don't think anybody i don't understand i think that the reason why he

02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:25.040
was brought up was because jewish people at the in this time period would have viewed it as um

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:29.120
there was a prevention of jews leaving europe because of the palestinians pressuring the

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:34.480
british to put a curb that 75 000 immigration limit yes but it's not about like it's not about

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:38.320
them furthering the holocaust or being an architect major minor play in the holocaust

02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:42.320
we use a major play in that region so i wanted to bring up like morris was specific made the

02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:47.600
specific claim that the palestinians played an indirect role in the holocaust the indirect

02:04:47.600 --> 02:04:53.120
role would have been the prevention of people escaping from yes and and my response to that is

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.840
first of all i i disagree with that characterization but second of all you disagree with that they

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:04.560
prevented they forced the british to prevent emigration of jews from europe and reaching

02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:10.080
safe shores in palestine again they did again and they knew that the was palestine persecuted in

02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:15.840
europe was palestine the only spot of land on earth yes basically that was the problem the jews

02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:21.200
couldn't emigrate what about what about your great friends in britain the architects of of the balfour

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:25.920
by the late 1930s what about the united states happy to take in jews and the americans and

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:31.600
weren't happy and why and why are palestinians who were not europeans who had zero role in the

02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:37.840
rise of nazism who had no relation to any of this why are they somehow uniquely responsible

02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:43.760
for what happened in europe and uniquely close the only safe haven for jews oh really the united

02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:50.480
states wasn't to say a potential state safe haven the only one was palestine at the time the united

02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:56.720
states had no room no it didn't have room for jews it did have room but it didn't want so that

02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:02.960
wasn't the only safe haven this is something to be focusing your america should be blamed for not

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:09.600
letting jews in during the 30s and 40s but nobody blames them for the holocaust well indirect no

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:14.800
i've never heard it said that franklin delanor roosevelt was indirectly responsible for the

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:20.080
holocaust i never heard that now maybe it's in israeli literature because the israelis have

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:27.120
gone mad your yes your prime minister said the whole idea of the gas chambers came from the

02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:32.880
mufti of jerusalem that's nonsense yeah we all know that's nonsense but we also know that netanyahu

02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:38.880
netanyahu says netanyahu says so many things which are and he happens to be the longest serving prime

02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:43.920
minister of israel no i can't be you're not responsible for them but it is relevant that

02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:48.240
he's the longest serving prime minister of israel unfortunately it says something about the israeli

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:53.520
public and he gets and he gets elected not despite saying such things but because he said

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:59.680
his voters don't care about hadram el husseini or hitler they know nothing about his they will be

02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:03.520
right his base know nothing about no nothing about anything and he can say what he likes

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:07.280
and they'll say yes so they don't care if he says these things you may well be right but but

02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:15.200
anyway not to beat a dead horse but i don't i i still don't understand that i'll just conclude

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:20.160
by saying i don't understand why the mufti of jerusalem is relevant he is relevant he is relevant

02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:26.400
but the head of the national palestinian of course samir wasn't the head of the national movement he

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:32.160
represented 100 or 200 or 300 gunmen who are considered terrorists by the zionist movement

02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:36.560
at the time the fact that 30 years later he becomes prime minister that's the crux of

02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:42.720
of this and his and his history was the head of the palestine arab national movement at the time

02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:47.840
anyway what can you do i think we're speaking past each other we're not i'm talking facts

02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:54.000
let's move to the modern day and we'll return to history maybe 67 and other important moments but

02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:00.800
let's look to today in the recent months uh october 7th let me ask sort of a pointed question

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:07.520
was october 7th attacks by hamas on israel genocidal was it wasn't an act of ethnic

02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:15.280
cleansing just so we lay out the moral calculus that we are engaging i don't maybe you was the

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:25.520
problem the problem with october 7th is this the hamas fighters who invaded southern israel

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:34.160
were sent ordered to murder rape and do all the nasty things that they did and they killed some

02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:41.840
1200 israelis that day and abducted them as we know something like 250 and civilian mostly

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:49.360
civilians also some soldiers and took them back to gaza dungeons in gaza but they were motivated

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:55.680
not just by the words of their current leader in the gaza strip but by their ideology which

02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:03.360
is embedded in their charter from 8 1988 if i remember correctly and that charter is genocidal

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:09.440
it says that the jews must be eradicated basically from the land of israel from palestine

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:17.520
the jews are described there as sons of apes and pigs the jews are a base people killers of prophets

02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:22.400
and they should not exist in palestine it doesn't say that they necessarily should be murdered all

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:28.000
around the world the hamas charter but certainly the jews should be eliminated from palestine and

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:35.760
this is the driving ideology um behind the massacre of the jews on october 7th which brought

02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:41.520
down on the gaza strip and i think with the intention by the hamas of the israeli counter

02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:47.040
offensive because they knew that that counter offensive would result in many palestinian dead

02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:53.600
because the hamas fighters and their weaponry and so on were embedded in the population in gaza

02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:59.280
and they hoped to benefit from this in the eyes of world public opinion as israel chased these hamas

02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:04.880
people and their ammunition dumps and so on and killed lots of palestinian civilians in the process

02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:10.800
all of this was understood by a sinwar by the head of the hamas and he strived for that but

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:17.600
initially he wanted to kill as many jews as he could in the border areas around the gaza strip

02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:24.400
i'll respond directly to the points you made and then um i'll leave it to norm to bring in the

02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:34.320
historical context that um hamas charter is from the 90s i think 1988 so it's from the 80s um

02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:42.240
i think your characterization of that charter as um anti-semitic is indisputable

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:50.560
okay i think your um characterization of that charter is genocidal is off the mark

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:59.840
it's implicit and more importantly that charter has been superseded by a new charter in fact has

02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:04.480
been well there is there is a there is no new charter there is there is an explanation a

02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:11.280
statement 2018 a political statement 2000 and something 2018 supposedly clarifying things which

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:15.680
are in the charter and but it doesn't actually step back from what the charter says eliminate

02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:22.240
israel eliminate the jews from the land of israel and in 2018 the hamas charter if we look at the

02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:26.240
current version of the charter it's not a call to whether whether you're calling it a charter

02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:31.120
it wasn't the only thing called the charter is what was issued in 1988 by yassin himself anyway

02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:37.920
it makes it makes a clear distinction um between um jews and zionists in 2018 now you can choose

02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:44.000
to dismiss it believe it it's sincere it's insincere uh whatever insincere is probably

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:52.720
the right word secondly i'm really unfamiliar um with fighters who consult these kinds of documents

02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:59.840
uh before they go on in the kindergarten they're told kill the jews they they practice with

02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:04.960
make-believe guns and uniforms when they're five years old in the kindergartens of the

02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:11.040
instruction of the commissioner general of unruh right i didn't say that i said the hamas has

02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:17.680
kindergartens and summer camps in which they train to kill jews children secondly secondly you keep

02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:22.960
you keep saying jews um to which i would respond they use the word jews to which i would respond

02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:30.960
that hamas does not have a record of deliberately targeting jews who are not israelis and in fact

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:37.600
it also doesn't have a record of deliberately targeting either jews or israelis outside israel

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:43.680
and palestine so you know all this talk of um unlike the hezbollah which has targeted

02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:46.960
well we're talking about jews outside we're talking about palestine we're talking about

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:53.520
october 7th and hamas if you'd also like to speak about hezbollah let's let's get to that separately

02:12:53.520 --> 02:13:04.640
if you if you don't mind um so again um genocidal well if if that term is going to be discussed

02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:11.520
my first response would be let's talk about potentially genocidal actions against israelis

02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:17.840
rather than against jews for the reasons that i just mentioned and again i find this constant

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:27.200
conflation of of of of jews israel zionism to be a bit disturbing secondly i think um there are

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:36.560
uh quite a few indications in the factual record that raise serious questions about um the accusations

02:13:36.560 --> 02:13:43.360
of the genocidal intent and and genocidal practice of what happened on october 7th and my final point

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:48.240
would be i don't i don't think i should take your your word for it i don't think you should take my

02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:55.760
word for it i think what we need here is a proper independent international investigation and the

02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:03.120
reason we need that of genocide during this conflict whether by uh palestinians on october

02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:11.760
7th or israel thereafter the reason that we need such an investigation is because hamas is there

02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:17.120
won't be any hearings on what hamas did on october 7th at the international court of justice

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:23.200
because the international convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of

02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:29.920
genocide deals only with with states and not with movements i think the international criminal court

02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:35.920
and specifically its current prosecutor kareem khan lacks any and all credibility he's been an

02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:41.280
absolute failure at his job he's just been sitting on his backside for years on this file

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:50.320
and i think um i would point out that hamas has called for independent investigations of all these

02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:56.080
allegations israel has categorically rejected any international investigation of course fully

02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:03.760
supported by the united states um and i and i think what is required is to have credible

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:08.960
investigations of these things because i don't think you're going to convince me i don't think

02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:14.400
i'm going to convince you and this is two people sitting across the table from each other there's

02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:19.840
certain things you don't even have to investigate you know how many citizens civilians died in the

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:24.400
october 7th assault but that's not you know that there are lots of allegations of rape i don't know

02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:30.480
how persuaded you are of those they did find bodies without heads which is there were no

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:36.000
islamic there were there were some beheadings apparently the israelis didn't even claim that

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:41.520
in the document they submitted before the icj go read what your government submitted it never

02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:47.120
mentioned beheadings well as far as i know some people will beheaded but we could bring it up

02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:52.480
right now you also deny that there were rapes there i didn't deny i said i've not seen convincing

02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:58.080
evidence that confirms it i've said that from day one and i'll say today four and a half months

02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:02.720
later do you know that they killed eight or nine hundred civilians in their absolutely that seems

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:09.040
to me indisputable oh okay well yes and it's i've said that i've said that from day one well to be

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:12.720
clear you haven't you did a debate um i don't remember the talk show but you seem to imply

02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:17.120
that there was a lot of crossfire and then it might have been the idf that i said i said that

02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:23.600
there is no question because the names were published in haritz there is no question that

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:31.360
roughly of the 1200 people killed 800 of them were civilians i see 850 fine so i never said

02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:37.120
that but then i said no we don't know exactly how they were killed but 800 civilians killed

02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:45.360
no 850 no question there and i also said on repeated occasions there cannot be any doubt

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:51.040
in my opinion as of now with the available evidence that hamas was responsible for significant

02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:55.600
atrocities and i made sure to include the plural there's a lot of tricky language being employed

02:16:55.600 --> 02:17:03.680
here do you think of the 850 it's called attaching value to words and not talking like a motor mouth

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:09.840
okay i am very careful about qualifying because that's what language is about that's great then

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:14.000
let me just ask a clarifying question do you firmly believe that the majority of the 850

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:22.800
civilians were killed by hamas my view is even if it were half 400 is a huge number

02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:29.600
by any reckoning it's okay wait you didn't i said even if wait wait wait because benny because

02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:40.160
professor maurice i don't know i agree with muin rabani i'm not sure if he concedes the 400 i'll

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:46.640
say why 400 because i have thought up the 100 400 right as i said of the 850 well watered

02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:52.320
because by how much if i may be a couple of individuals were killed in this i don't i don't

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:57.200
know you're saying from day one you believe this particular thing and you clearly don't you clearly

02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:02.880
don't believe this thing you don't one i said people died that's not controversial wait hold

02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:10.880
on hold on that's not controversial now mr banel i attach value to words yes you said that when

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:19.520
i when i was mr banel please slow down the speech and attempt to listen when i was explicitly asked

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:27.360
by pierce morgan i said there can be no question that hamas committed atrocities i've heard this

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:35.360
on october 7th if you want me to pin down a number i can't do that and ask you to come down a number

02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:39.920
you can listen to what i'm saying no my question is okay i'll ask you very precise sorry if you

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:43.520
because you're not it's a very it's a very easy question if i understood your question correctly

02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:46.640
my question is do you think the majority of the people that were killed on october 7th the

02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.880
civilians were killed by hamas are we subscribing to the idea that the idf killed hundreds four or

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:55.840
five hundred no but let me explain why that's a difficult question to answer the total number

02:18:55.840 --> 02:19:03.680
of civilians killed was eight hundred eight hundred fifty we know that hamas is responsible

02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:11.280
probably for the majority of those killings we also know that there were killings by islamic

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:16.640
jihad we also know we're bunching together the islamic jihad and the hamas that's splitting

02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:22.160
hairs now specifically he means the raiders i'm speaking i'm speaking in opposition to the

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:27.840
conspiracy theory that um people like do you prefer norm or professor franklestein or what

02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:31.200
do you i don't know what your how do you prefer it's not a conspiracy there because the conspiracy

02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:34.720
theory is the idea that the idf killed the majority of them it's not a conspiracy and

02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:38.400
then there's also and there's also a theory that um as norm pointed out on the show that he was

02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:44.240
on that he thought that it was very strange that given how reputable uh israeli services are when

02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:48.400
it comes to sending ambulances retrieving bodies he thought it was very strange that that number

02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:52.400
was continually being adjusted and do you know why you say that in combination with well i'm not

02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:56.320
sure how many were killed well do you know why the number do you know why the number went down

02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:01.760
the number went down because the israeli authorities were in were in possession of

02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:10.880
200 corpses that were burned to a crisp that they assumed were israeli um israelis who had

02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:17.040
been killed on october 7th they later determined that these were in fact palestinian fighters

02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:23.280
now how does a palestinian fighter get burnt to a crisp no you're mixing two things some of the

02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:28.720
bodies they didn't weren't able to identify and eventually they just ruled that some of them were

02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:34.880
actually arab marauders rather than israeli victims some a few of them also of the jews

02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:39.840
were burnt to a crisp and it took them time to work this out and they came out initially with a

02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:45.440
slightly higher figure 1400 dead and eventually reduced it to 1200 and the reason is and the

02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:50.640
reason is that a proportion of israeli civilians killed on october 7th i don't believe it was a

02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:59.920
majority we don't know how many some were killed in crossfire some were killed by israeli shell

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:08.960
fire helicopter fire and so on and the majority were killed by palestinians and of that majority

02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:15.200
um we don't know i mean again i i understood your question is referring specifically to hamas which

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:21.360
is why i tried to answer it that way but if you meant generically palestinians yes if you mean

02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:26.240
specifically hamas we don't have a clear breakdown of how i don't mean specifically hamas but i just

02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:30.960
think when you use the word some that's doing a lot of heavy lifting that's fine but some can

02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:37.280
mean anywhere from one percent to 49 but we don't know so the numbers here in the details are

02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:41.040
interesting and important almost from a legal perspective but if we zoom out

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:46.640
the moral perspective are palestinians from gaza justified in violent resistance

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:54.720
well palestinians have the right to resistance palestinian that right includes the right to

02:21:54.720 --> 02:22:01.600
armed resistance at the same time armed resistance is subject to the laws of war

02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:08.880
and there are very clear regulations that separate legitimate acts of armed resistance

02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:14.880
from acts of armed resistance that are not legitimate and the attacks of october 7th

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:22.160
where do they land for you there's been almost exclusive focus on the attacks on civilian

02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:30.240
population centers and and the killings of civilians on october 7th what is much

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:39.360
much less discussed to the point of amnesia is that there were very extensive attacks on

02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:46.240
israeli military and intelligence facilities on october 7th i would make a very clear distinction

02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:58.240
between those two and secondly i'm not sure that i would characterize the efforts by

02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:07.600
palestinians on october 7th to seize israeli territory and israeli population centers

02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:14.160
as in and of themselves illegitimate you mean attacking israeli civilians no legitimate no

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:18.880
no that's not what i didn't understand what you said i think what you had on october 7th

02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:25.600
was an effort by hamas to seize israeli territory and population and kill civilians that's not what

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:34.240
i said what i said is i think i i'm i would not describe the effort to seize israeli territory

02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:41.840
as in and of itself illegitimate as a separate issue from the killing of israeli civilians where

02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:46.000
in those cases where they had been deliberately targeted that's very clearly

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:50.720
all families were slaughtered in kibbutzim but i'm making many of them left wingers

02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:56.320
accidentally who helped palestinians go to hospitals in israel and so on again even drove

02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:02.160
palestinian cancer patients to hospitals again i'm making a distinction you don't seem to be very

02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:07.200
condemnatory of what the hamas did well i don't do selective condemnation i'm not talking about

02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:13.760
i don't do selective condemnation of this specific well you know what it is you know i would i would

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:20.000
for example condemn israeli assaults on civilians deliberate assaults on civilians i would condemn

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.400
them but you're not doing that you know you know what the issue is um i've been speaking in public

02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:33.600
now i would say since the late 1980s and interviewed and so on i have never on one occasion ever been

02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:41.120
asked to condemn any israeli act when i've been in group discussions those supporting

02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:45.120
the israeli action or perspective i have never encountered an example

02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:52.960
where these individuals are asked to condemn what israel is doing the um the the demand

02:24:52.960 --> 02:25:00.880
and obligation of condemnation is exclusively applied in my personal experience over decades

02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:07.280
is exclusively applied to palestinians no this is not well is condemned day and night on every

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:12.400
television channel on every and has been for the last i'm telling you about a personal experience

02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:19.440
lasting decades you said quote oh no i'm trying to quote what you just said i shouldn't have said

02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:27.520
anything at any point you should say professor maris yes you just said i would condemn and anytime

02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:35.360
israel deliberately attacks civilians yes okay the problem professor maris is

02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:47.440
over and over again you claim in the face of overwhelming evidence that they didn't attack

02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:53.600
civilians that's not true i've said israel has attacked civilians israel attacks and i've written

02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:59.600
extensively about it i know that in kaffir kassim they killed civilians and now let's let's see you

02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:06.160
you're just okay selecting okay as steven says you cherry pick if i were you you cherry pick

02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:12.800
let's fast forward when you were an adult what did you say about the 1982 lebanon war

02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:14.000
war

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:24.080
what did i say you don't remember okay allow me okay so it happens that i was not at all

02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:31.280
by any i had no interest in the israel palestine conflict as a young man until the night is true

02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:38.000
until the 1982 lebanon war yeah uh i'll find it okay real quick while he's searching for that

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.680
yeah you bring up something that's really important that a lot of people don't draw

02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:46.880
distinction between in that there is just causes for war and there is just ways to act within a

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:51.760
war and these two things principally do have a distinction from one another however um while

02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:57.600
i appreciate the recognition of the distinction the idea that the the cause for war that hamas

02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:01.760
was engaged in i don't believe if we look at their actions in war or the statements that they've

02:27:01.760 --> 02:27:06.400
made it doesn't seem like it had to do with the territorial acquisition no no no no i the the

02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:13.600
taking land no the point i was making was um what was hamas trying to achieve militarily

02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:20.880
on october 7th and i was pointing out that the focus has been very much on

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.040
hamas attacks on civilians and atrocities and so on and i'm not saying those things should be

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:34.400
ignored what i'm saying is that what's getting lost in the shuffle is that there were extensive

02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:42.960
attacks on military and intelligence facilities and as far as the let's say the other aspects

02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:49.680
are concerned because i think either you or lex asked me about the legitimacy of these attacks i

02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:59.760
said i'm i'm unclear whether efforts by hamas to seize israeli population centers in and of themselves

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:08.080
are illegitimate as opposed to actions that either deliberately targeted israeli civilians

02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:17.520
or actions that um should reasonably have been expected to result in the killings of israeli

02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:22.880
civilians those strike me as by definition illegitimate um and i want to be very clear

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:28.240
about that i have where i legitimate means you condemn them illegitimate means they are not

02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:33.600
legitimate i i have a problem condemning your side yes no not condemning my side i have a

02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:38.400
problem with selective outrage and i have a problem with selective condemnation and as i

02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:44.960
i explained to you a few minutes ago in in my decades of of appearing in public and being

02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:52.480
interviewed i have never seen um i've never been asked to condemn an israeli action i've never

02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:59.280
been asked for a moral judgment on an israeli action i'm um exclusive request for condemnation

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:05.680
has to do with what palestinians do and more and just as importantly um i'm sure if you watch bbc

02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:10.880
or cnn when is the last time an israeli spokesperson has been asked to condemn

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:16.000
an israeli act i've i've never seen it i don't think we condemn the arab side either though right

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.480
i don't understand any kind of nation no but now that we're talking about israeli victims all of

02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:24.720
the sudden morality is well i think the reason why it comes up is because there's no shortage

02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:28.800
of international condemnation for israel as norm will point out a million times that there are 50

02:29:28.800 --> 02:29:32.800
billion u.n resolutions you've got amnesty international you've got multiple bodies of

02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:36.320
the un you've got now this case for the icj so there's no question of if there's condemnation

02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:44.320
sorry if i can interrupt you in 1948 the entire world stood behind the establishment of a jewish

02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:48.960
state in the entire world except arab states and the muslim states well not the entire world okay

02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:52.880
but i think you know what i mean by that the western democracies that's what you're saying

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:58.000
supported the establishment of israel my quick question was you said that you believe that this

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:01.680
is a very short one you're not it's just you think that um you think that there's an argument to be

02:30:01.680 --> 02:30:05.840
made that the people in gaza that hamas and his armajad whoever participated had a just cause

02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:09.680
for war maybe they didn't do it in the correct way but they maybe had a just cause for war

02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:12.400
i don't think there's a maybe there the palestinians okay you think they absolutely had a

02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:16.560
just cause for it do you think that israel has a just cause for operations sorts of iron no of

02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:24.240
course not okay all right you can say your clock okay uh first of all on this issue of double

02:30:24.240 --> 02:30:35.040
standards which is the one that irks or irritates muin you said that you are not a person of double

02:30:35.040 --> 02:30:43.840
standards unlike people like muin you hold high a single standard and you condemn deliberate israeli

02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:55.120
attacks on um civilians and i would say that's true for the period up till 1967

02:30:55.840 --> 02:31:03.600
and i think it's accurate you are your account of the first intifada there it seems to me you

02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:12.400
are in conformity with most mainstream accounts and the case of the first intifada you also used

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:18.880
surprisingly he used arab human rights sources like al haq which i think muin worked for

02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:26.160
during the first intifada that's true but then something very strange happens

02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:31.360
so let's illustrate it wait there's something strange which happened is the arabs rejected

02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:36.240
okay wait peace offers that's what happened well by accepting the oslo agreement yeah not the

02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:44.720
time i can't okay if we have time i know the record very well i'd be very happy to go through

02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:50.560
it with you but let's get to those double standards so this is what you have to say about

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:59.120
israel's invasion of lebanon in 1982 you said israel was reluctant to harm civilians

02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:10.480
civilians sought to avoid casualties on both sides and took care not to harm

02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:18.480
lebanese and palestinian civilians you then went on to acknowledge the massive use of

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:26.640
idf firepower against civilians during the siege of beirut which traumatized israeli society

02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:35.440
marx maris quickly answers the caveat the israel quote tried to pinpoint military targets

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:43.520
but inevitably many civilians were hit that's your description of the lebanon war as i say

02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:51.360
that's when i first got involved in the conflict i am a voracious reader i read everything on the

02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:59.920
lebanon war i would say there's not a single account of the lebanon war in which the estimates

02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:08.640
are between 15 and 20 000 palestinian lebanese were killed overwhelmingly civilians the biggest

02:33:08.640 --> 02:33:18.800
bloodletting until the current gaza genocide biggest bloodletting i would say i can't think

02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:28.160
of a single mainstream account that remotely approximates what you just said so leaving aside

02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:35.760
i can name the books voluminous huge volumes i'll just take one example now you will remember

02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:41.600
because i think you served in lebanon in 82 am i correct on that yeah yeah so you will remember

02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:49.920
that dove yarmulke kept the war diary so with your permission allow me to describe what he

02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:58.960
wrote during his diary so he writes the war machine of the idf is galloping and trampling

02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:06.800
over the conquered territory demonstrating a total insensitive insensitive insensitivity

02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:14.320
to the fate of the arabs who are found in its path a pilo run hospital suffered a direct hit

02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:21.680
thousands of refugees are returning to the city when they arrive at their homes many of which have

02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:28.560
been destroyed or damaged you hear their cries of pain and their howls over the deaths of their

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:35.680
loved ones the air is permeated with the smell of corpses destruction and you know i continue

02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:42.000
what you're making actually does that sound like your description of the lebanon war

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:47.440
forget my description forget it the point you're making words are in print we can't let me just

02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:53.520
finish my sentence the point you're making which you somehow forget is that there are israelis who

02:34:53.520 --> 02:34:59.360
strongly criticize their own side and describe how israelis are doing things which they regard

02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:06.000
as immoral you don't find that on the arab side i'm talking about you mr morris i'm not talking

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:12.640
about dev yarmulke i'm talking about you the historian how did you depict the lebanon because

02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:17.680
i believe i believe that the israeli military tried to avoid committing a civilian casual

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:23.840
as i think they as well as i think they've all the accounts by robert fisk and pity

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:29.760
the nation yeah i know all the anti-zionist journalists i know has always been right so

02:35:29.760 --> 02:35:37.200
that's why that's why you can say with such confidence that you don't commit you don't condemn

02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:41.600
deliberate israeli attacks and there weren't any because there weren't any no i didn't say

02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:46.960
the word yeah you didn't you agreed that i have condemned israeli attacks on civilians

02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:56.800
i never quarrel with facts your your description of the 1982 war is so shocking it makes my innards

02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:04.080
writhe and then your description of the second intifada your description of defensive shield

02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:11.040
when they were bombing is arab suicide bombers when arab suicide bombers were destroying

02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:17.680
jews and masses and buses and in restaurants that's the second intifada do you remember that

02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:24.640
you could try suicide bombers in jerusalem's buses i am completely aware of that but you well but

02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:31.600
if you forgot the numbers i don't forget it was three to one the number killed mostly armed

02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:37.120
palestinian government that's what you say in your book that's what that's not what amnesty

02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:43.360
international said that's not what human rights i don't remember what they said i do no that's

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:47.600
not what i don't know whether their figures are right amara figures are right listen listen

02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:55.920
in the second some 4000 palestinians most of them your armed people and israelis that's a

02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:02.400
israelis were killed almost all of them no professor maris fantasy but i'm not going to

02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:08.320
argue with here here's a simple challenge you said not to look at the camera scares the people

02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:14.080
i'll make the open challenge you are going to scare them no professor maris open challenge

02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:23.840
words are in print i wrote 50 pages analyzing all of your work i quote some will say cherry pick

02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:34.160
but i think accurately uh quote you here's a simple challenge answer me in print answer what

02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:41.680
i wrote and show where i'm making things up answer me i'm sorry i'm not familiar with that's no

02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:46.960
problem you're a busy van you're an important historian you don't have to know everything

02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:54.800
that's in print especially by modest publishers but now you know and so here's the public challenge

02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:03.040
you answer and show where i cherry picked where i misrepresented send me the article

02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:10.000
and then we can have a civil scholarly discussion i'm not sure we will agree even if we don't have

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:17.600
to agree it's for the reader to decide looking at both sides where this truth stands no and

02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:23.760
if i may ask uh it's good to discuss ideas that are in the air now as opposed to citing

02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:29.200
literature that was written in the past as much as possible because listeners were not familiar

02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:35.360
with the literature so like whatever was written just express it uh condense the key idea and then

02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:41.520
we can debate the ideas there are two aspects there's a public debate but there's also written

02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:47.520
words yes i'm just telling you that you as a as an academic historian put a lot of value in the

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:52.320
written word and i think it is valuable but in this he's incidentally not the only historian

02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:57.520
who puts value to words i also do actually yes but so we in more than just one or two sentences

02:38:57.520 --> 02:39:02.800
at a time but this this in this context just for the educational purpose of teaching people

02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:10.320
purpose is why would people commit what i have to acknowledge because i am faithful to the facts

02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:19.680
massive atrocities on october 7th why did that happen and i think that's the problem the past

02:39:19.680 --> 02:39:29.440
is erased and we suddenly went from 1948 to october 7th 2023 and there is a problem there

02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:33.680
so first of all you have complete freedom to backtrack and we'll go there with you

02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:39.280
obviously we can't cover every single year every single event but there's probably critical moments

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:42.320
in time can i respond to something relating to that the libanon war i looked at the book that

02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:48.800
he got this from what the quote was from um it sounds cold to say it but war is tragic and

02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:54.480
civilians die there is no war that this has not happened in in the history of all of humankind

02:39:54.480 --> 02:40:00.320
the statement that israel might take care not to target civilians is not incompatible with a diary

02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:04.320
entry from someone who said they saw civilians getting killed i think that sometimes we do a

02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:08.240
lot of weird games when we talk about international humanitarian law or laws that govern conflict but

02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:13.760
we say things like civilians dying is a war crime or civilian homes or hospitals getting destroyed

02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:18.400
is necessarily a war crime or is necessarily somebody intentionally targeting civilians without

02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:23.040
making distinctions between military targets or civilian ones i think that when we analyze

02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:25.920
different attacks or when we talk about the conduct of the military i think it's important

02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:32.240
to understand uh like prospectively from the unit uh of analysis of the actual military committing

02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:36.560
the acts what's happening and what are the decisions being made rather than just saying

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:41.280
retrospectively oh well a lot of civilians died not very many you know military people died

02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:46.720
comparatively speaking so uh it must have been war crimes especially when you've got another side

02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:51.520
um i'll fast forward to hamas that intentionally attempts to induce those same civilian numbers

02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:55.840
because hamas is guilty of any war crime that you would potentially accuse and this is according

02:40:55.840 --> 02:40:59.920
to the amnesty international people that norm loves to cite hamas is guilty of all of these same

02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:03.680
war crimes of them failing to take care of the civilian population of them essentially utilizing

02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:10.240
human shields to try to fire rockets free from attacks essentially yes as i'm just saying that

02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:13.520
essentially as in terms of how international law defines it not how amnesty international defines

02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:16.960
it but amnesty international describes times of human shielding but they don't actually apply the

02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:26.240
correct international legal standard i know absolutely but i'm just saying i'm just saying

02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:30.000
i'm just saying believe it or not normal the entire genevieve convention is all on wikipedia

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:33.280
it's a wonderful website but i'm just saying i'm just saying that on the hamas side if there's an

02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:37.680
attempt to induce this type of military activity attempt to induce civilian harm that is not just

02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:41.680
enough to say like well here's a diary entry where a guy talks about how tragic i think the problem

02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:48.640
i think the problem with with with your statement is that if you go back and listen to it the first

02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:55.840
part of it is war is hell civilians die it's it's a fact of life and and and you state that

02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:01.440
in a very factual matter then when you start talking about hamas all of a sudden you've

02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:06.240
discovered morality and you've discovered condemnation and you've discovered intent

02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:11.680
and and and you're unfortunately far from alone in this i'll give you i'll give you you know who

02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:17.760
for me is a perfect example wait hold on we don't need examples no the false equivalency of the two

02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:23.760
sides is astounding when hamas kills civilians in a surprise attack on october 7th this isn't

02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:27.840
because they are attempting to target military targets and they happen to stumble into a giant

02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:32.240
festival of people that well they did happen to stumble into it they did but they killed 300

02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:35.520
yeah but they did but when they stumbled into it it wasn't an issue of trying to figure out a

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:39.040
military target or not they weren't failing in distinction there wasn't a proportionality

02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:44.480
assessment done it was just to kill civilians even the mdst international in 2008 and in 2014

02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:48.400
and even today will continue to say that it's like the types of attacks you'll find anyone who will

02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:54.000
deny that hamas has targeted civilians sure you gave the example but there's a difference because

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:59.520
of suicide bombings uh during the second intifada i mean facts are facts sure but i'm saying that

02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:03.200
the hamas targeting of civilians is different than the incidental loss of life that occurs

02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:09.360
when israel does how you know genocide is the intentional mass murder genocide is a

02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:14.720
entirely separate claim yeah but the idea that israel is not in the business of intentionally

02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:21.760
targeting civilians um i know that's what we're supposed to believe um but but the historical

02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:28.320
record stands no no that's clearly i don't believe it does you've written about historical do you

02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:33.840
mean like in the 40s to the 60s or do you mean like i would say from the 30s of the last century

02:43:33.840 --> 02:43:40.720
to the 20s of this century i i just like to make you know you the way the way you um characterized

02:43:40.720 --> 02:43:45.840
it i think the best example of that i've come across during this specific conflict is is john

02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:51.680
kirby the white house spokesman i've i've named him tears tossed around for a very good reason

02:43:52.400 --> 02:44:01.040
um when he's talking about palestinian civilian deaths war is hell you know it's a fact of life

02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:07.360
get used to it when he was confronted with israeli civilian deaths on october 7 he literally broke

02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:12.160
down in tears and one is deliberate and one isn't he understood that no that's what he tried to make

02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:18.960
us know no he's he was speaking facts the hamas guys who attacked the kibbutzim they apart from

02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:24.400
the attacks on the military sites when they attacked the kibbutzim were out to kill civilians

02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:31.280
and they killed family after family house after house the israeli attacks on hamas installations

02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:35.760
better and finally i don't know better no you don't know israeli pilots that's the problem

02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:42.240
thank god you know no you don't know i know they believe that they are killing hamasnicks

02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:46.800
they're given certain objectives and that's what they attack and if the hamas is hiding

02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:52.000
behind civilians civilians die every time they target every time they target a kid i'm sure they

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.960
believe it's hamas when they kid yeah when they yeah when they killed the four kids in the on the

02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:02.320
world they believe yeah i know they believe even though they were the mini tip size you know even

02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:06.720
though they were in that angle you don't see the size they saw you don't see the size let's see

02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:11.040
the side oh i know what he's quoting you've lied about this particular instance in the past those

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:14.560
kids weren't just on the beaches as often stated articles those kids were literally coming out of

02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:19.680
a previously identified hamas compound that they have operated from they literally you can google

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:25.840
you can google it with all due respect with all due respect you're such a fantastic moron it's

02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:35.040
terrifying that that wharf was filled with journalists there were tens scores of journalists

02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:42.720
that was an old fisherman's shack what are you talking about it's so painful

02:45:43.440 --> 02:45:48.880
it's so painful to listen to this idiocy and to be clear on the other side you're implying that a

02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:52.800
strike was okayed on the israeli side where they said we're just going to kill four palestinian

02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:56.560
children today for no reason did you believe that you know do you believe that do you believe that

02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:01.200
right up right okay there was a hotel of journalists do you think that they were out to kill more

02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:06.240
children here we go we'll never answer that i will answer the question pilots were out i will even

02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:10.480
answer and it was because that was a strike that was a drone strike so it was a proof all the way

02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:15.760
we're going to kill children okay you want me to answer or do you want your motor mouth to go

02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:24.080
okay answer in 2018 there was the great march of return in gaza

02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:34.000
by all reckonings of human rights organizations and journalists who were there it was overwhelmingly

02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:44.800
non-violent whoever organized organized by satan let's say okay satan i agree let's let's go for

02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:51.840
the big one the big magilla it's satan okay overwhelmingly organized overwhelmingly non-violent

02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:57.280
resembled at the beginning the first ones here in the first into father they represent the first

02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:02.800
okay not bombs but they tried to make holes in the space okay obviously let's continue yeah

02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:09.200
so but i'm not sure israel behaved morally in that okay okay okay wait wait wait i'm willing

02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:14.000
to grant you please please i'm willing to allow me allow me to you don't have to pursue it because

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.600
i'm willing to allow me allow me to finish i don't know anything about this i'd like okay

02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:27.840
so as you know along the gaza perimeter there was israel's best trained snipers correct

02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:36.400
i don't know best training snipers okay all right because hey laugh it's hilarious the story is so

02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:42.640
funny you're lying about aspects of violence to it okay even the u.n says it themselves okay

02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:48.320
but you only collect what the u.n says that you like the problem mr morelli is you don't know the

02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:53.040
english language you don't i can read from the u.n website itself in regards to the great march of

02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:57.600
return they said well the vast majority of protesters acted in a peaceful manner during

02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:03.120
most protests dozens have approached the fence attempting to damage it burning fires throwing

02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:08.240
stones and molotov cocktails towards israeli forces and flying incendiary kites and balloons

02:48:08.240 --> 02:48:12.560
into israeli territory the latter results in extensive damage to agricultural land and nature

02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:17.040
reserves inside israel and risk the lives of Israeli civilians some intensive shooting throwing

02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:21.760
an explosive yeah talk fast talk fast so people think that you're coherent i'm just reading from

02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:26.000
the u.n yeah but you see you like them sometimes only when they agree with you you got the months

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:32.400
wrong you got the months wrong we're talking about the beginning in march 30th 2018 you just

02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:39.840
described that mostly okay allow me to finish so there were the snipers okay now you find it so

02:48:39.840 --> 02:48:47.680
far-fetched israelis purposely deliberately targeting civilians that's such a far-fetched

02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:56.160
idea an overwhelmingly non-violent march what did the international investigation was a campaign

02:48:56.160 --> 02:49:00.640
whatever you want to call for months whatever you want to call months yeah what did the u.n

02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:08.400
investigation find well he just read it i read the report i don't read things off of those

02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:16.240
machines i read the report what did it find brace yourself you thought it was so funny the idea

02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:24.800
of idf uh targeting civilians it found go look this up on your i already know what you're gonna

02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:31.280
say you're gonna say only one or two of them were justified killings targeted journalists

02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:41.360
targeted medics and here's the funniest one of all it's so hilarious they targeted disabled people

02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:50.960
who were 300 meters away from the fence and just standing by trees is true if it's true

02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:57.360
all right just quick pause uh i think everything was fascinating to listen to except the mention

02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:03.200
of hilarious nobody finds any of this hilarious and if any of us are laughing it's not at the

02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:08.800
suffering of civilians or suffering of anyone it's at the uh the obvious joyful camaraderie

02:50:08.800 --> 02:50:13.840
in the room so i'm i'm enjoying it and also the joy of learning so thank you can we talk about

02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:17.680
the targeting civilian thing a little bit i think there's like an important underlying not

02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:20.720
necessarily that i just i think it's important to understand yeah i think it's important to

02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:23.840
understand there's like three different things here that we need to think about so one is

02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:28.560
a policy of killing civilians do we so i would ask the other side i'm gonna ask all three because

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:32.800
i know there won't be a short answer do you think there is a policy top down from the idf to target

02:50:32.800 --> 02:50:37.760
civilians that's one thing a second thing is he says yes when i understand yeah that's right

02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:41.760
okay but then then the second thing is or there's there's two distincts i want to draw between i

02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:47.200
think benny would say this i would say this um i'm sure undoubtedly there have been cases

02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:52.320
where idf soldiers for no good reason have targeted and killed palestinians that they

02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:56.720
should not have done that would be prosecutable as war crimes as defined by the rums and some

02:50:56.720 --> 02:51:04.960
have been prosecuted i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure that we would all agree for

02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:09.360
soldiers if that happens but i think that it's important i think that it's important that when

02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:13.600
we talk about military strikes when we talk about things especially involving bombings or drone

02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:18.720
attacks these are things that are signed off by multiple different layers of command by multiple

02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:22.160
people involved in an operation including intelligence gathering including weaponeering

02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:27.760
and they're also typically lawyers involved when you make the claim that an idf soldier shot a

02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:30.800
palestinian those three people the three hostages that came up with white flags and something

02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:34.400
horrible happened i think that's a fair statement to make and i think a lot of criticism is deserved

02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:38.800
but when you make the statement that four children were killed by a strike the claim that you're

02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:42.400
making yeah deliberately the claim that you're making the claim that you're making is that

02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:47.360
multiple levels of the idf signed off on just killing i have no idea what that's right if you

02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:50.960
don't understand the process then let me educate you i can tell you i do understand the process

02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:55.760
i'm telling you i'm trying to explain you right now yes i'm no i it's basic you can ask anybody

02:51:55.760 --> 02:52:01.520
aside from wikipedia yes you can talk to people you can talk to people who work in the military

02:52:01.520 --> 02:52:04.800
what's your knowledge of the idea audience can look this up do you think that do you think that

02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:08.960
do you think that bombing and strikes are decided by one person in the field do you think one person

02:52:08.960 --> 02:52:15.520
i respond to every time i tell you as a pilot doesn't do it that are designed to figure out

02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:19.600
how to strike and who to strike so when you say that four children are targeted you're saying

02:52:19.600 --> 02:52:24.960
that a whole apparatus is trying to murder for palestinian children which is a ridiculous

02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:31.200
argument because oh really that it's impossible at the command level it's impossible the command

02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:36.080
level but you said that they couldn't have done it at the bottom if it weren't also at the top

02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:39.920
you don't understand the strength of the claim that you're making you're saying that from a

02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:45.760
top-down level that lawyers multiple commanders all these people signed off on killing for

02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:53.040
palestinians it's true it's true i don't spend my nights on wikipedia i read books i admit that as a

02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:59.600
signal yeah as i know books are a waste of time with all due regard there the only thing you take

02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:05.600
from them are two or three quotes that you use i completely respect the fact and i'll say it on

02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:14.240
the air as much as i find totally disgusting what's come of your politics a lot of the books

02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:21.120
are excellent and i'll even tell you because i'm not afraid of saying it whenever i have to check

02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:27.840
on the basic fact the equivalent of going to the britannica i go to your books i know you got a

02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:35.040
lot of the facts right benny moore's i would never i would never say books are a waste of time and

02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:41.440
it's regrettable to you that you got strapped with a partner who thinks that all the wisdom

02:53:41.440 --> 02:53:47.680
all the wisdom he didn't say they're wasting time i'd like to respond to what you were saying um

02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:54.560
the the i think the question that that we're trying to answer i think you don't understand

02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:59.360
israel you know i let me let me finish really understands i think we're all it works i think

02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:06.160
we're all agreed that palestinians have deliberately targeted civilians whether we're

02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:12.240
talking about hamas and islamic jihad today or previously i prefer the word murdered and raped

02:54:12.240 --> 02:54:17.600
rather than targeted target is too soft for what the hamas did i'm okay i'm not i'm not talking

02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:23.840
about i'm talking about this now yeah but i'm i'm trying to answer his question um historically

02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:31.760
there is um substantial evidence that palestinians have targeted uh civilians whether

02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:36.080
whether it's been incidental or systematic is a different discussion i don't want to

02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:41.600
get into that now for some reason there seems to be a huge debate about whether

02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:48.160
any israeli has ever sunk so low as to target a civilian i know we've agreed both

02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:54.480
agree this has happened here okay and i think agreed on that okay i think um what we're saying

02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:59.280
is it's not policy which is what you guys are implying that they kill civilians deliberately

02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:06.240
if i understand you correctly you're basically making the claim that none of these attacks could

02:55:06.240 --> 02:55:10.560
have happened without going through an entire chain of commands strike cells that are involved

02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:16.400
in like drone attacks or plane attacks or yes my understanding of the israeli military and you

02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:21.440
could perhaps um you've served in it you would know better it's actually a fairly chaotic

02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:26.640
organization no no that's not true especially not the air force extremely extremely organized

02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:32.720
the air force works in a very organized fashion as he says with lawyers a chain of command and

02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:38.400
ultimately the pilot drops the bomb where he's told to drop it was that 200 200 strikes in like

02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:42.480
60 seconds i think i think at the opening of protective edge like the yeah the coordination

02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:46.960
between you're talking about 2000 day uh for i think yeah measures 2014 but i'm just saying

02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:51.920
that the coordination in the military is pretty well my understanding of the israeli military

02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:58.480
it's very special is that it's quite chaotic and there's also a lot of testimonies from israel but

02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:06.320
be that as it may okay i'm i'm prepared to accept um both of your contentions that it's a highly

02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:11.600
organized and disciplined force air force under any scenario is going to be more organized than

02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:16.880
the other branches and and you're saying such a strike would have been inconceivable well i'm not

02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:21.200
necessarily saying i'm just saying that like that would have required okay you're basically intent

02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:24.880
for so many yes i don't think good evidence has been presented to say that that's your your basic

02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:29.680
claim is that we should we it would be fair to assume that such a strike could have only been

02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:37.440
carried out with multiple um levels of authorization and and signing off okay let's accept that for

02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:47.200
the sake of argument um we have now seen incident after incident after incident after incident

02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:54.320
where entire families are vaporized in in single strikes who is in the families who lives in the

02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:59.040
house family members no family members next to the house family members in which these families

02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:03.920
we have seen incident do you know that hamasnicks weren't in that house do you know that their

02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:09.440
dumps were why do i have to prove a negative you're saying that they deliberately targeted

02:57:09.440 --> 02:57:15.120
well families you know if israel wanted to kill civilians in in in gaza they could have killed

02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:19.760
500 000 by now with the number of strikes and therefore and therefore the fact that they only

02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:28.160
killed a certain small number 30 000 is a small number small number in proportion over four months

02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:34.880
probably is an indication that it's targeted and that there are hamas targets in these places so

02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:42.080
i've i've given you know children is only and if that's the case why is it yeah you said only

02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:51.200
only though professor marz here's a question for you if we take every combat zone in the world for

02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:56.880
the past three years every combat zone in the world in vietnam the americans killed a million

02:57:56.880 --> 02:58:01.680
people well they could have killed 40 million i wasn't yeah i was again in the anti-war movement

02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:08.720
so don't extrapolate a million people fine fine and and uh 30 million russians were killed so

02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:13.200
in during world war two so everything else is irrelevant okay not here's a question

02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:20.720
professor marz here's a question it's very perplexing if you take every combat zone in

02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:29.840
the world for the past three years and you multiply the number of children killed by four

02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:38.880
every combat zone in the world you get gaza okay so what is that supposed to prove okay i'm gonna

02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:45.120
i'm gonna tell you just shut up you're relying on hamas numbers no i'm not relying on the numbers

02:58:45.120 --> 02:58:50.240
that everybody else i'm not lying in the numbers though what is that those hamas numbers okay

02:58:50.240 --> 02:58:54.800
okay which may not be true fine they could invent anything because i think that they are

02:58:54.800 --> 02:59:01.280
a mendacious organization i know mendacious believe me you like mendacious as in the israeli

02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:08.800
ministry of foreign affairs okay so here's the thing you say they could have killed 500,000

02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:14.320
but they only killed only that's your words i'm not only killed 30,000 you believe that they

02:59:14.640 --> 02:59:19.680
deliberately target civilians they could have would have killed many many more the fact is

02:59:19.680 --> 02:59:24.880
that they don't deliberately target civilians professor marz for if you don't understand

02:59:24.880 --> 02:59:29.760
for a historian i don't want to understand israeli society you don't want to know the truth i don't

02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:36.000
want to i don't want to get inside their heads that's the problem 90 percent of a good historian

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:42.320
historian tries to get into the heads of there's a limit there's a limit there's a limit when 90

02:59:43.200 --> 02:59:50.320
90 percent of israelis think that israel is using enough or too little force in gaza

02:59:50.320 --> 02:59:58.080
i don't want to get inside that head 40 think that israel is using insufficient force in gaza

02:59:58.080 --> 03:00:02.400
i don't want to get inside that head i don't want to get inside the head of people who think

03:00:03.120 --> 03:00:09.040
they're using insufficient force against the population against the population half of which

03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:15.600
is children i don't want to get inside that head but here is the point because your partner

03:00:16.160 --> 03:00:23.280
wants to know the point you don't understand political constraints one of your ministers

03:00:23.280 --> 03:00:29.520
said let's drop an atomic bomb on gaza you really meant that he said it through you no no no it was

03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:35.040
said in the sort of a very questionable way he didn't say they should drop it the day i'm not

03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:42.800
supporting he's an idiot this minister this minister is a messianic idiot but he didn't

03:00:42.800 --> 03:00:51.360
say drop an atomic bomb none other than israel's chief historian the famed justifiably famed

03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:58.320
benny maris thinks we should be dropping nuclear weapons on iran iran has for years its leaders

03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:03.600
for years have said we should destroy israel you agree with that they've said we should destroy

03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:08.640
israel israel must be destroyed yeah have you is that correct this is what the iranian leaders

03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:14.000
have been saying since home i would say iranian leaders have said mixed messages okay okay but

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.640
some of them have said including hamenei and if you don't know the evidence if you don't know

03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:24.400
the evidence why are you laughing it's very funny it's funny it's funny

03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:30.240
oh yeah wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait to the extent that the houthis are complicated

03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:34.160
to the extent that the houthis are trying to stop the genocide in gaza

03:01:34.160 --> 03:01:40.400
there is no genesis i support i support i know i selectively support international law when it

03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:44.800
agrees with you okay and then when it doesn't you decide to throw international laws in gaza

03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:50.880
if you like yeah hold on no no let me read what you said norm norm stop please norm just for me

03:01:50.880 --> 03:01:55.600
please just give me a second you said that there's no genocide going on in gaza let me ask that clear

03:01:55.600 --> 03:02:01.440
question the same question i asked on the hamas attacks is there from a legal philosophical

03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:08.480
moral perspective is there genocide going on in gaza today is there a genocide going on in gaza

03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:15.200
well in several years we will have a definitive response to that question what has happened thus

03:02:15.200 --> 03:02:25.040
far is that on the 29th of december the republic of south africa instituted proceedings against

03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:32.000
israel pursuant to the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide

03:02:33.200 --> 03:02:40.720
south africa basically accused israel of perpetrating genocide in the gaza strip

03:02:41.520 --> 03:02:52.080
on the 26th of january the the court issued its initial ruling the court at this stage

03:02:54.080 --> 03:03:01.920
is not making a determination on whether israel has or has not committed genocide so just as it

03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:09.440
has not found israel guilty it certainly also hasn't found israel innocent what the court

03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:15.840
had to do at this stage was take one of two decisions either south africa's case was

03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:24.720
the equivalent of a frivolous lawsuit and dismiss it and close the proceedings or it had to determine

03:03:25.440 --> 03:03:33.280
that south africa presented a plausible case that israel was violating its obligations

03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:41.360
under the genocide convention and that it would on that basis hold a full hearing now a lot of people

03:03:42.320 --> 03:03:50.880
have looked at the court's ruling of the 26th of january and focused on the fact that the court

03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:56.480
did not order a ceasefire i actually wasn't expecting it to order a ceasefire and i wasn't

03:03:56.480 --> 03:04:03.200
surprised that it didn't because in the other cases that the court has considered most prominently

03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:12.000
bosnia and miyanmar it also didn't order a ceasefire and south africa in requesting a

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:18.320
ceasefire also didn't ask the court to render an opinion on the legitimacy or lack thereof

03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:27.840
of israel's of israel's military operation from my perspective the key issue on the 26th of january

03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:33.920
was whether the court would simply dismiss the case or decide to proceed with it and it decided

03:04:33.920 --> 03:04:39.360
to proceed and it decided to and i think that's enormously i think that's enormously but you said

03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:44.320
they committed genocide you already said they committed genocide it's committing genocide but

03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:51.680
if i could just allow allow me allow me that's correct now i don't run away so norman you did

03:04:51.680 --> 03:04:57.520
say israel can you let me finish well the end of the story is you specifically asked whether

03:04:57.520 --> 03:05:03.680
i think israel is committing genocide i explained formally there is no finding and as you said we

03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:08.800
won't know for a number of years and i think there's legitimate questions to be raised i mean in

03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:14.880
the bosnia case which i think all four of us would agree was clearly a case of genocide the court

03:05:14.880 --> 03:05:21.680
determined by the service yes and in the bosnia case the court determined that of all the evidence

03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:28.480
placed before them only srebrenica qualified as genocide and all the other atrocities committed

03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:34.880
did not qualify as genocide you know international law is a developing organism i don't know

03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:42.160
how the court is going to respond in this case so i wouldn't take it as a foregone conclusion

03:05:42.800 --> 03:05:47.760
how the court is going to respond but mormon has determined already i have too because you're asking

03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:54.400
my personal personal opinion so as a matter of law i want to state very clearly it has not been

03:05:54.400 --> 03:06:04.080
determined and won't be determined for several years based on my observations and and the evidence

03:06:04.080 --> 03:06:11.520
before me i would say it's indisputable that israel is engaged in a genocidal assault against the

03:06:11.520 --> 03:06:18.720
palestinian people in the gaza strip yeah with the program the plo is long past what okay the

03:06:18.720 --> 03:06:29.040
what defines as as as you were saying um genocide is is is not a body count um genocide consists of

03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:36.480
two elements um the destruction of a people in whole or in part so in other words you can commit

03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:41.760
genocide by killing 30 000 people it doesn't have well five probably is below the threshold

03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:48.800
yes but i think 30 000 crosses the threshold and not reaching 500 000 is probably relevant

03:06:49.360 --> 03:06:54.720
and the second element is there has to be an intent in other words and you believe there's an

03:06:54.720 --> 03:07:01.600
intent yes i think if if there is any other plausible reason for why all these people are

03:07:01.600 --> 03:07:07.840
being murdered it's not genocide and as far as intent what about hiding behind a human shield

03:07:07.840 --> 03:07:11.600
you don't think that's the reason for them being killed well let's get the intent part out of the

03:07:11.600 --> 03:07:22.480
way first um south africa's forget south africa i'd like to finish i think they're pro satan as well

03:07:22.480 --> 03:07:27.600
last time no they're pro kamas um you know for some reason you don't have a problem with people

03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:35.120
being pro-israeli at the time of of of this but if they support palestinians right to life or

03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:40.000
self-determination they get demonized and delegitimized as pro-hamas in an organization

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:45.040
which murdered 1200 people deliberately that's my but supporting a state that has murdered 30 000

03:07:45.040 --> 03:07:49.360
but they haven't because these are 30 000 are basically human shields used by the

03:07:50.080 --> 03:07:56.160
which wanted killed okay they wanted them killed all right if i must wanted these sure if i could

03:07:56.160 --> 03:08:00.400
just get you don't think they wanted them killed no i don't provide them with shelters they build

03:08:00.400 --> 03:08:05.360
tunnels for their fighters but not one shelter for their own civilians you asked me about in course

03:08:05.360 --> 03:08:10.480
they want them killed okay you asked me about intent and the reason that i bought in um the

03:08:10.480 --> 03:08:18.400
south african application is because it is actually exceptionally detailed on intent by

03:08:18.400 --> 03:08:23.280
quoting numerous sorts of idiotic ministers in israel well yeah including the prime minister the

03:08:23.280 --> 03:08:28.640
defense minister didn't say the chief of staff didn't say genocide no he said amalek he said

03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:35.120
amalek use the word amalek because their kamas are a really important organization if i may

03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:42.160
according to asa kashar the philosopher of idf yeah he said that netanyahu was

03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:49.520
was avowing genocide so he's an idiot so the point he's an idiot but he is air past it so the

03:08:49.520 --> 03:08:55.360
the reason i raised the south african application is twofold hamas or no hamas it's exceptionally

03:08:55.360 --> 03:09:02.560
detailed on the question of on the question of intent and secondly when when the international

03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:09.360
court of justice issues a ruling individual justices um have have the right can give their

03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:14.720
own opinion and i found the german one to be the most interesting on on this specific question

03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:21.680
because he was basically saying that he didn't think south africa presented a persuasive case

03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:32.320
but he said their um their section on intent was so overpowering that he felt he was left with no

03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:37.760
choice but to vote with with the majority so i think that answers um the intent part of your

03:09:37.760 --> 03:09:42.320
question so for the icj case that south africa's brought i think there's a couple things that need

03:09:42.320 --> 03:09:48.160
to be mentioned one is and i saw you two talk at length about this the plausibility standard is

03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:52.640
incredibly low the only thing we're looking for is a basic presentation of facts that make it

03:09:52.640 --> 03:09:59.920
conceivable possible that plausible plausible which legally this is obviously below criminal

03:09:59.920 --> 03:10:06.720
conviction below uh yeah below think of it as an indictment sure possibly maybe even a lower level

03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:11.920
than even an indictment so plausibility is an incredibly low standard number one um number two

03:10:12.640 --> 03:10:18.000
if you actually go through and you read the complaint that south africa filed um i would

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:23.600
say uh that if you go through the quotes and you even follow through to the source of the quotes

03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:28.800
the misrepresentation that south africa does and their case about all of these horrendous quotes

03:10:28.800 --> 03:10:35.120
in my opinion borders on criminal well 16 icj judges disagree that's fine if 16 icj judges

03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:40.880
disagree but i'm gonna give competent you know they could be but it must be or even the american

03:10:40.880 --> 03:10:49.360
judge she must have been awful incompetent if she was unable to see the misrepresentations that

03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:55.680
mr banel based on his wikipedia entry was able to find so this is based on the official icj

03:10:55.680 --> 03:10:59.840
report that was released i'm not sure if you read the entire thing i read okay that's great

03:10:59.840 --> 03:11:03.680
did you go through and actually identify any of the sources for the underlying quotes actually

03:11:03.680 --> 03:11:11.760
brace yourself for this and muin could confirm it yaniv kogan an israeli and jamie sternweiner

03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:22.720
half israeli they checked every single quote in the hebrew original and yaniv kogan loved the guy

03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:31.120
he has terrifying powers of concentration he checked every single quote is that correct

03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:38.960
and jamie checked every single quote in the english in the context and where there were

03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:46.160
any contextual questions they told us i think they found one yeah i think i found one so

03:11:46.800 --> 03:11:57.040
i do not believe that those 16 15 judges was 15 to 2 16 to 2 i think they're 15 on the court plus

03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:04.960
two so it's 17 so it's 15 to 2 i don't think those 15 judges were incompetent

03:12:06.240 --> 03:12:16.640
and i certainly don't believe the president of the court an american would allow herself to be

03:12:16.640 --> 03:12:24.480
duped okay

03:12:24.480 --> 03:12:29.280
sure so this was uh taken from the uh from the south african complaint there's tons of these

03:12:29.280 --> 03:12:35.440
but so here's one uh in the in the complaint for the icj they said that on the 12th of october 2023

03:12:35.440 --> 03:12:41.680
president isaac herzog made clear that israel was not distinguishing between militants and civilians

03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:47.120
in gaza stating in a press conference to foreign media in relation to palestinians in gaza over

03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:53.680
one million of whom are children quote quote it's an entire nation out there that is responsible

03:12:53.680 --> 03:12:59.200
it is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved i saw that it's absolutely not

03:12:59.200 --> 03:13:04.960
true and we will fight until we break their backbone end quote if you actually go to the

03:13:04.960 --> 03:13:09.600
news article that they even state they even link it in their complaint the full context for the

03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:15.200
quote was quote it is an entire nation out there that is responsible it's not true this rhetoric

03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:19.840
about civilians not being aware not involved it's absolutely not true they could have risen up they

03:13:19.840 --> 03:13:24.640
could have fought against that evil regime which took over gaza in a coup d'etat but we are at war

03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:29.280
we are defending our homes we are protecting our homes that's the truth and when a nation protects

03:13:29.280 --> 03:13:33.680
its home it fights and we will fight until we break their backbone he acknowledged that many

03:13:33.680 --> 03:13:38.640
gazans had nothing to do with hamas but was adamant that others did quote i agree there are many

03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:43.120
innocent palestinians who don't agree with this but you have a missile in your goddamn kitchen and

03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:47.680
you want to shoot it at me am i allowed to defend myself we have to defend ourselves we have the

03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:52.720
right to do so this is not the same as saying there's no distinction between militants and

03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:57.360
civilians in gaza his statement here is actually fully compliant with international law to the

03:13:57.360 --> 03:14:02.320
letter because if you are storing military supplies in civilian areas these things become

03:14:02.320 --> 03:14:06.080
military targets and you're allowed to do proportionality assessments afterwards so this

03:14:06.080 --> 03:14:09.920
is supposed to be one of many quotes that they've shown that is supposed to demonstrate

03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:15.200
uh genocidal intent but it is very easily explained by military intent or by a conflict

03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:19.760
between two parties i saw that press conference wait let me just say something all of this talk

03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:26.720
is a bit irrelevant because it sounds it may sound to the listeners that the the court in the hag

03:14:26.720 --> 03:14:31.600
has ruled that israel is committing genocide no i think it hasn't doesn't it's just is going in

03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:36.880
in the next few years to look at the whole subject there has been no determination at all

03:14:36.880 --> 03:14:43.200
and as a as stephen says uh some of the quotes are not exactly accurate quotes or taken out of

03:14:43.200 --> 03:14:52.800
this characterization yes okay it is correct as muin put it that'll be seven years several years

03:14:52.800 --> 03:14:58.160
before the court makes a determination and my guess is that it will determine there was no

03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:05.120
genocide that's my guess yes now i'm just giving you my guess i can't predict i got it all wrong

03:15:05.120 --> 03:15:09.680
actually as muin will attest i got it all wrong the first time i never thought the american judge

03:15:09.680 --> 03:15:15.040
would vote again vote in favor of plausibility so you admit that you are wrong yeah of course

03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:19.360
i think i tell muin twice a day i was wrong about this and i was wrong about that

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:26.400
i'm not wrong about the facts i try not to be but my speculations they can be wrong okay leaving

03:15:26.400 --> 03:15:32.720
that aside first of all as muin pointed out there's a difference between the legal decision

03:15:32.720 --> 03:15:39.840
by the ruling and an independent judgment now south africa was not filing a frivolous case

03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:47.840
that was 84 pages it was single even 84 pages can be very frivolous it takes an hour and a half

03:15:47.840 --> 03:15:54.160
to read it was not a massive case it was single spaced and it had literally hundreds of footnotes

03:15:54.160 --> 03:16:01.440
can still be with with it's possible of course it could be wasn't yeah i read the report to tell

03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:05.920
you the truth i followed very closely everything that's been happening to october 7th i was

03:16:05.920 --> 03:16:13.360
mesmerized i couldn't believe the comprehensiveness of that particular report number two there are two

03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:19.760
quite respected judges excuse me there were two quite respected experts of international law

03:16:19.760 --> 03:16:27.440
sitting on the south african panel john dugard and von low von low as you might know he argued

03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:35.280
the war case in 2004 before the international court of justice now they were not uh they were

03:16:35.280 --> 03:16:41.840
alleging genocide which in their view means the evidence in their minds we're not yet the court

03:16:41.840 --> 03:16:47.600
the evidence in their minds compels the conclusion that genocide is being committed

03:16:48.400 --> 03:16:54.480
i am willing because i happen to know mr dugard personally and have corresponded with von low

03:16:54.480 --> 03:17:01.120
i've heard their claim i've read the report i would say they make a very strong case but let's

03:17:01.840 --> 03:17:06.000
agree plausible now here's a question

03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:08.400
question

03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:18.240
if somebody qualifies for an olympic team let's say a regional person qualifies for olympic team

03:17:18.960 --> 03:17:24.080
it doesn't mean they're going to be on the olympic team it doesn't mean they're going to win a gold

03:17:24.080 --> 03:17:30.000
medal a silver medal or bronze bronze they can swim that's what you're saying no i would say

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:34.960
that's a very high bar you're saying they can swim they even qualify swim well enough to have

03:17:34.960 --> 03:17:43.280
a realistic prospect so to even make it to plausible that is not true that is not what

03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:50.160
plausible means it is absolutely not you're dead wrong mr borelli please don't teach me about the

03:17:50.160 --> 03:17:56.320
english language so the declaration of judge i said he says that the court is not asked in the

03:17:56.320 --> 03:18:01.200
present phase as qualifying the court is not asked at this present phase of the proceedings to

03:18:01.200 --> 03:18:06.240
determine whether south africa's allegations of genocide are well founded they're not well

03:18:06.240 --> 03:18:10.480
founded they're not even well founded the court is you said that plausible was a high standard

03:18:10.480 --> 03:18:15.920
is absolutely not it is a misrepresentation of the strength of the case against israel just like the

03:18:15.920 --> 03:18:19.440
majority of the quotes they have in this case are and also you said it was an extremely well

03:18:19.440 --> 03:18:23.760
founded case they spend like one fourth of all of the quotations some even pulled from the gold

03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:29.280
stone report they try to uh that actually deal with the intent part which is by the way i think

03:18:29.280 --> 03:18:32.640
you guys i don't know if you use the phrase the dolo speciales that the intentional part of

03:18:32.640 --> 03:18:37.840
genocide the the the i think it's i think it's called dolo speciales it's the most important

03:18:37.840 --> 03:18:42.000
part of genocide which is proving the specialist is a highly special intent to commit genocide

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:48.320
it's possible that israel that's mens reum no the men's right yes i understand the state of mind

03:18:48.320 --> 03:18:53.280
but for genocide there is it's called dolo speciales it's a highly special intent did you read the

03:18:53.280 --> 03:19:00.320
case it is a highly special intent i'm going to ask you again yes please stop displaying your

03:19:00.320 --> 03:19:05.520
imbecility okay i'm sorry you think the declaration of the judges don't put on public

03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:11.760
display that you're a moron at least have the self-possession to shut up did i read the

03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:18.800
putting my display on camera putting yours in books okay i read the case around four times

03:19:18.800 --> 03:19:26.560
i read all of the the uh the majority opinion the declarations i read our own barack's declaration

03:19:26.560 --> 03:19:34.960
and why are you lying and saying plausible standard because i said even reaching the

03:19:34.960 --> 03:19:44.240
benchmark of plausibility is a very high standard in the world it's the equivalent of a regional

03:19:44.240 --> 03:19:51.040
player qualifying for an olympics it's still two steps removed you may not be on the team

03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:59.120
and you may not get a medal but to get qualified which in this context is the equivalent of

03:19:59.120 --> 03:20:07.120
plausible you must be doing something pretty horrible but as it happens of course and as it

03:20:07.120 --> 03:20:14.160
happens remember what i just told you the court i don't expect to be

03:20:14.240 --> 03:20:19.840
even around when the court reaches its final decision why they'll take a long long time

03:20:19.840 --> 03:20:24.560
two years no i don't think they'll take two or three years i mean bosnia which was admittedly

03:20:24.560 --> 03:20:31.760
a special type of case because they were accusing serbia of sponsoring the bosnian serbs that took

03:20:31.760 --> 03:20:38.640
i think 17 years from 90 i assume they'll take two or three years but the point you're making

03:20:38.640 --> 03:20:44.160
so this is a legal this thing horrible must be happening to even achieve it's horrible it's a

03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:51.360
war yeah that's true yes but i think they weren't rendering a ruling on the war they were rendering

03:20:51.360 --> 03:20:57.120
a ruling on the genocide and i think i think the suggestion they also said it was plausible that israel

03:20:57.120 --> 03:21:01.440
is committing a military operation as well yeah but i think the problem with with your characterization

03:21:01.440 --> 03:21:05.920
is you're saying in so many words the south africans basically only have to show up in court

03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:10.800
with a coherent statement that is correct in today's atmosphere that's probably they needed

03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:18.880
to do a lot more they needed they needed to they needed to persuade judges go according to what

03:21:18.880 --> 03:21:24.880
the majority want want to hear yeah but they need a president they needed to persuade the court

03:21:24.880 --> 03:21:32.080
that it was worth investing several years of their time in hearing this case they're well paid whether

03:21:32.080 --> 03:21:37.760
they take this case or not i mean you know they have a they have a full docket um whether they

03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:42.640
accept to reject this case and i think i don't think we should remember what i just said they

03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:47.120
won't rule there was genocide remember what i said also i recommend people actually read the case and

03:21:47.120 --> 03:21:52.720
follow through a lot of the quotes that they just don't show genocidal the israeli minister of

03:21:52.720 --> 03:21:58.000
finance on the 8th of october 2023 this is taken from the icj this is from south africa submission

03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:02.480
uh bezalel smotrik i can't read this stated there you go okay at a meeting of the israeli

03:22:02.480 --> 03:22:07.440
cabinet that quote we need to deal a blow that hasn't been seen in 50 years and take down gaza

03:22:07.440 --> 03:22:11.520
and quote but again if you click through and you read the source their own linked source it says

03:22:11.520 --> 03:22:16.880
as per this own source quote the powerful finance minister subtler leader uh bezalel smotrik i can't

03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:21.600
pronounce his demanded at the cabinet meeting late saturday that the army quote hit hamas brutally

03:22:21.600 --> 03:22:26.160
and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration and quote quote in war

03:22:26.160 --> 03:22:30.400
as in war you have to be brutal end quote he was quoted as saying quote we need to deal a blow that

03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:36.080
hasn't been seen in 50 years and take down gaza end quote you can't strip the quotation of hamas

03:22:36.080 --> 03:22:40.560
a entity that you're at work with and then i think there's genocidal intent that's not that's no

03:22:40.560 --> 03:22:47.200
genocide when the ukrainians say we need to take down gaza that's not genocidal no when ukraine

03:22:47.200 --> 03:22:51.760
says we need to defeat russia is that genocidal they mean killing all russian citizens professor

03:22:51.760 --> 03:22:58.240
mars here's another one when when the defense yeah ridiculous yes ridiculous uh the american

03:22:58.240 --> 03:23:04.640
judge he also doesn't determine the american judge the american judge read you are holding

03:23:04.640 --> 03:23:08.400
the american judge to you know well he was the president yes he'll appeal to the authority when

03:23:08.400 --> 03:23:12.880
it agrees with him and we won't deal with the actual facts of the matter ever the american judge

03:23:13.760 --> 03:23:18.320
read several of the quotes look at the american supreme court today they may support

03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:29.600
shows you without going too far afield if you heard a statement by the defense minister

03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:39.360
the defense minister said we are going to prevent any food water fuel or electricity from entering

03:23:39.360 --> 03:23:44.640
gaza he wanted to make did israel do that okay no i'm i'm wondering what he said i'm asking you

03:23:44.640 --> 03:23:49.200
isn't israeli government but we're talking about statements now intent how would you

03:23:49.200 --> 03:23:54.160
interpret that after 1200 of your citizens are murdered the way they were i would expect

03:23:54.160 --> 03:23:59.360
extreme statements by lots of politicians but but but you're by lots of but you don't accept

03:23:59.360 --> 03:24:03.520
extreme palestinians wait but you don't accept what he said isn't israeli policy but you don't

03:24:03.520 --> 03:24:09.280
they let him order they let him gas i'm sure you don't accept you don't accept extreme palestinian

03:24:09.280 --> 03:24:13.680
statements after they lost their entire country not just 1200 people that's a good point

03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:21.200
no no it's a good point and on that uh on that moment brief moment of agreement let's just take

03:24:21.200 --> 03:24:26.400
a quick pause we need a smoke break we need a water break in a bathroom break gaza is not a

03:24:26.400 --> 03:24:30.720
genocide genocide is a genocidal statement we went to war with iraq and we wanted to

03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:34.800
destroy iraq that was a genocidal statement there's a reason why genocide is so it's such

03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:38.480
an importantly guarded concept and it's not to condemn every nation that goes to war

03:24:38.480 --> 03:24:46.320
for now but you do know how to pronounce my name you may use it in italian all the time

03:24:46.320 --> 03:24:51.360
but you're solicited for international laws you should try learning it sometime it would help you

03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:57.040
sort out a lot of the civilian deaths unfortunately 15 judges you could keep citing the judges you

03:24:57.040 --> 03:25:03.040
should actually try reading the actual statements this is tiring you've invited us to a tiring

03:25:03.040 --> 03:25:10.880
session yeah there you go how you guys doing okay okay there are major things to discuss here

03:25:10.880 --> 03:25:16.160
not just what what some court is doing and then a judge in two years time yes okay so what you just

03:25:16.160 --> 03:25:21.200
said is my whole one of the reasons why i feel so strongly about this particular conflict is

03:25:21.200 --> 03:25:24.000
because there are really important things to discuss but they will never be discussed

03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:28.800
they're not we're not going to talk about like uh like uh area a b and c or what a transference

03:25:28.800 --> 03:25:32.080
of territory instead we're going to talk about apartheid we're not going to talk about um you

03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:35.440
know the differences in how do you conduct war in an urban environment where people we're just

03:25:35.440 --> 03:25:39.440
talking about genocide we're not going to talk about um what's a good solution for the palestinians

03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:43.360
we're just going to say ethnic cleansing possible to talk be productive over the next two hours and

03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:48.960
talk about solutions about solutions i have no idea what to say i mean there i don't see any

03:25:48.960 --> 03:25:53.120
solutions on you know if you wanted a positive end to this discussion which is what you said

03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:58.000
at the beginning i can't contribute to that because i i'm pessimistic i don't see anywhere

03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:02.800
any way forward here but the lack of the solution is easy the reason why the solution is hard is

03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:07.840
because the histories and the myths are completely there's a different factual record right one of

03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:12.320
the things would be good to talk about solutions with the future is going back in all the times

03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:16.320
it has failed so every time but even at that we're probably not going to agree he's going to say you

03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:19.840
could write that i can predict the whole line he's going to say from 93 to 99 he's going to say israel

03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:25.040
didn't adhere to the aslo courts ever settlement expansion continued uh raids happened into the

03:26:25.040 --> 03:26:30.800
west bank that there was never a legitimate that netanyahu came in and violated the um the y

03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:33.760
memorandum the transference he's going to say all of this and he's not going to bring up anything

03:26:33.760 --> 03:26:37.440
that palestinians died and then for camp david he's going to say that uh yeah that arafat was

03:26:37.440 --> 03:26:41.440
trying that the maps and the territorial exchange wasn't good enough that they were asking palestinians

03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:45.680
to make all the concessions that israel would have made that gets yeah well lay it all up

03:26:45.680 --> 03:26:48.160
lay it up you do it for quickly yeah i know yeah

03:26:48.560 --> 03:26:53.680
and yeah my future book should interest you guys oh what are you working on it no it's not working

03:26:53.680 --> 03:27:01.840
on it's actually going to come out ah it deals with israeli and arab atrocities war crimes i call

03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:08.640
them in the 48th war oh really yeah just deals with that subject is this um because i know

03:27:08.640 --> 03:27:15.440
you've also uh talked about the closure of the archives and stuff well it's it's marginal

03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:21.680
and stuff well it's it's marginal because they do it deals with that as well but they have tried to

03:27:21.680 --> 03:27:26.800
seal off documents which has already used and seen so now they don't let people see them

03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:33.600
that's happened but it's marginal in terms of its effect on on on were the british archives useful

03:27:33.600 --> 03:27:38.960
for you for this new book well for this list it's mostly israeli archives the british and

03:27:38.960 --> 03:27:44.960
americans and the un did deal with these subjects but not not as well as israeli documents what's

03:27:44.960 --> 03:27:51.120
your uh casualty count for deri assin it's about 100 i think there's agreement on that by israelis

03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:58.720
and arabs 105 because before they they used to say 245 and 54 those were the figures the british

03:27:58.720 --> 03:28:03.680
and the arabs and the hagana agreed on at the beginning because the red cross i think was the

03:28:03.680 --> 03:28:08.240
one that first put out that number i don't remember maybe it was what's his name jack

03:28:08.240 --> 03:28:14.880
the rainier or maybe yeah maybe he he came up with that number but it was just he didn't count

03:28:14.880 --> 03:28:19.760
they didn't count bodies they just threw the number out and everybody was happy to blame the

03:28:19.760 --> 03:28:24.400
ergun and the lehi for you know killing more arabs and actually well and they put it to good

03:28:24.400 --> 03:28:30.080
use as well well they said that it helped to precipitate more evacuation so they were

03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:37.920
yeah yeah yeah so first of all thank you for that heated discussion about the present

03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:48.800
i would love to go back into history in a way that informs what we can look for in uh uh as a

03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:54.800
by way of hope for the future so when has in israel and palestine have been closest

03:28:55.680 --> 03:29:01.600
to something like a peace settlement to something that like where both sides would be

03:29:02.400 --> 03:29:11.680
happy and enable the flourishing of both peoples well my my from my knowledge of the 120 years or

03:29:11.680 --> 03:29:17.360
so of conflict the closest i think the two sides have been to reaching some sort of settlement

03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:24.160
uh appears to have been in the year 2000 when barack and then subsequently clinton

03:29:25.120 --> 03:29:34.240
offered a two-state uh settlement uh to plo palestinian authority chairman yasser arafat

03:29:34.240 --> 03:29:42.720
and arafat seemed to waver he didn't immediately in a reject what was being offered but ultimately

03:29:42.800 --> 03:29:49.280
came down at the end of camp david in july 2000 he came down against the proposals and the clinton

03:29:49.280 --> 03:29:56.000
who said he wouldn't blame him later blamed arafat for bringing down the summit and not

03:29:56.000 --> 03:30:03.440
reaching a solution there but i i think they're on the table certainly in the clinton parameters

03:30:03.440 --> 03:30:12.480
of december 2000 which followed the proposals by barack in july the palestinians were offered

03:30:12.480 --> 03:30:16.880
the best deal they're ever going to get from israel unless israel is destroyed and then

03:30:16.880 --> 03:30:22.000
there'll just be a palestinian arab state but the best deal that israel could ever offer them

03:30:22.000 --> 03:30:28.880
they were offered which essentially was 95 percent of the west bank each jerusalem a half of the old

03:30:28.880 --> 03:30:35.360
city of jerusalem some sort of joint control of the temple mount and the gaza strip of course in

03:30:35.360 --> 03:30:41.440
full and the palestinians said no to this deal and nobody really knows why arafat said no that is

03:30:41.440 --> 03:30:49.520
some people think he was trying to hold out for slightly better terms but my reading is that he

03:30:49.520 --> 03:30:57.280
was constitutionally psychologically incapable of signing off on a two-state deal meaning acceptance

03:30:57.280 --> 03:31:02.880
of the existence of a jewish state this was really the problem and of israel or of a jewish state of

03:31:02.880 --> 03:31:08.080
a jewish state the jewish state of israel he wasn't willing to share palestine with the jews and

03:31:08.080 --> 03:31:13.360
put his name to that i think he just couldn't do it and that's my reading but some people say it

03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:18.800
was because the terms were insufficient and he was willing but was waiting for slightly better

03:31:18.800 --> 03:31:23.120
terms i don't i don't buy that i don't think so but other people disagree with me on this

03:31:23.920 --> 03:31:28.080
what do you think well just briefly in response

03:31:28.160 --> 03:31:35.760
once arafat formally recognized israel in 1993

03:31:37.440 --> 03:31:46.160
i don't i don't think actually that in 2000 2001 a genuine resolution was on offer because i think

03:31:46.800 --> 03:31:52.640
the maximum israel was prepared to offer admittedly more than it had been prepared to offer in the

03:31:52.640 --> 03:31:58.480
past fell short of the minimum that the palestinians considered to be a reasonable

03:31:59.200 --> 03:32:07.680
two-state settlement bearing in mind that as of 1949 israel controlled 78 percent of the

03:32:07.680 --> 03:32:15.440
british mandate of palestine the palestinians were seeking a stay on the remaining 22 percent

03:32:15.440 --> 03:32:20.480
and this was apparently too much for israel my my response to your question would be

03:32:20.480 --> 03:32:26.800
wait wait they were being offered something like 22 or 21 they were being offered i think less

03:32:27.440 --> 03:32:34.480
than a withdrawal to the 1967 borders with mutual and minor and reciprocal land swaps

03:32:34.480 --> 03:32:41.440
and the just resolution of the refugee problem was one of the questions yes you know i i worked

03:32:41.440 --> 03:32:48.560
for a number of years with international crisis group and my boss at the time was rob mallee

03:32:48.640 --> 03:32:55.360
who was one of the american officials who was recently thrown out of the department whatever

03:32:55.360 --> 03:33:02.240
the point i'm the point i want to make about rob was he wrote i think a very perceptive article

03:33:02.240 --> 03:33:07.440
in 2001 in the new york review of books i know that you and ehud barak have had a debate with

03:33:07.440 --> 03:33:16.240
them but i think he gives a very compelling reason of why and how camp camp david failed but rather

03:33:16.240 --> 03:33:22.800
than going into that i'll he wrote that together with the hussein ara who was not at camp david

03:33:23.920 --> 03:33:34.240
but in response to your question i think there could have been a real possibility of israeli

03:33:34.240 --> 03:33:42.960
palestinian and arab israeli peace in the mid 1970s in the wake of the 1973 october war

03:33:43.920 --> 03:33:53.600
um uh i'll i'll recall that in 1971 moshe dayan israel's defense minister at the time

03:33:54.640 --> 03:34:02.000
full of triumphalism about israel's victory in 1967 speaking to a group of israeli military

03:34:02.000 --> 03:34:10.960
veterans stated you know if i had to choose between um shermesheikh without peace or

03:34:10.960 --> 03:34:17.360
peace without shermesheikh this is referring to the resort in in egyptian sinai which was an

03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:23.360
under israeli occupation dayan said i will choose for shermesheikh without peace

03:34:24.880 --> 03:34:33.600
then the 1973 war came along and um i think israeli calculations began to change very

03:34:33.680 --> 03:34:40.000
significantly and i think it was in that context that had there been a joint

03:34:41.760 --> 03:34:52.800
us soviet um push for um uh an arab israeli and israeli palestinian resolution

03:34:53.600 --> 03:34:59.760
that incorporated both an israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines and the establishment

03:35:00.320 --> 03:35:08.480
of a palestinian state um in in the occupied territories i think there was a very reasonable

03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:16.320
prospect for that being achieved it ended up being aborted i think um uh for several reasons

03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:25.120
and ultimately um the egyptian uh president anwar sadat um decided uh for reasons we can

03:35:25.120 --> 03:35:34.480
discuss later to launch a separate unilateral initiative for um israeli egyptian rather than

03:35:34.480 --> 03:35:41.920
arab israeli peace and i think once that set in motion um the prospects uh disappeared because

03:35:42.640 --> 03:35:49.920
israel essentially saw its most powerful adversary removed from the equation and felt that this would

03:35:49.920 --> 03:35:56.080
give it a free hand in the occupied territories also in lebanon to get rid of the plo and so on

03:35:56.720 --> 03:36:04.160
so um you know and you ask when were we closest and i can't give you an answer of when we were

03:36:04.160 --> 03:36:11.840
closest i can only tell you one i think we we could have been uh close and that was a that

03:36:11.840 --> 03:36:17.120
was a lost opportunity um if we look at the situation today you know there's been a lot

03:36:17.120 --> 03:36:23.600
of discussion about a two-state settlement my own view and i've i've written about this

03:36:24.240 --> 03:36:31.520
uh i don't i don't buy the arguments of the naysayers that we have passed the so-called

03:36:31.520 --> 03:36:38.400
point of no return with respect to a two-state settlement certainly if you look at the israeli

03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:46.000
position in the occupied territories i would argue it's more tenuous than was the french position

03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:54.000
in algeria in 1954 than was a british position in ireland in 1916 than was the ethiopian position

03:36:54.000 --> 03:37:01.600
in eritrea in 1990 and so as a matter of practicality as a matter of principle

03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:11.280
i do think um the establishment of a palestinian state uh in in the occupied territories remains

03:37:11.280 --> 03:37:17.200
realistic i think the question that we now need to ask ourselves it's one i'm certainly asking

03:37:17.200 --> 03:37:25.920
myself um since october 7th and looking at israel's genocidal campaign but also looking at

03:37:25.920 --> 03:37:36.400
larger questions is it desirable can you have peace with what increasingly appears to be an

03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:44.880
irrational genocidal state that seeks to confront and resolve each and every political challenge

03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:54.400
with violence and that reacts to its failure to achieve solutions to political challenges

03:37:54.400 --> 03:38:01.760
with violence by applying even more violence that has an insatiable lust for palestinian territory

03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:11.520
um that you know a genocidal apartheid state that seems increasingly incapable of even conceiving

03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:20.640
of peaceful coexistence um uh with with the other people on that land um so i'm very pessimistic

03:38:20.640 --> 03:38:27.680
that a solution is possible i look at um i grew up um in western europe in the long shadow

03:38:28.320 --> 03:38:34.640
of the second world war um i think we can all agree that there could have been no peace

03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:41.360
in europe um had certain regimes on that continent not been removed from power

03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:49.760
i look at um southeast asia in the late 1970s and i think we're all agreed that there could

03:38:49.760 --> 03:38:56.480
not have been peace in that region had the khmer Rouge uh not been ousted i look at southern

03:38:56.480 --> 03:39:03.040
africa during the 1990s and i think we can all be agreed that had the white minority regimes

03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:09.920
of um that ruled zimbabwe and south africa not been dismantled there could not have been peace

03:39:09.920 --> 03:39:16.800
in that region and although i think it's worth having a discussion um i do think it's now

03:39:16.800 --> 03:39:28.080
legitimate question to ask can there be peace um without dismantling uh the zionist regime

03:39:28.080 --> 03:39:33.280
and i make a very clear distinction between the israeli state and its institutions on the one hand

03:39:34.400 --> 03:39:41.440
and the israeli people who i think regardless of our discussion uh about the history i think you

03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:47.760
can now talk about an israeli people and the people um that have developed uh rights over time

03:39:48.480 --> 03:39:57.600
and um a formula for peaceful coexistence with them will need to be found which is a separate

03:39:57.600 --> 03:40:03.920
matter from uh dismantling um the israeli state and its institutions and again i haven't reached

03:40:04.480 --> 03:40:10.880
clear conclusions about this except to say as a practical matter i think a two-state uh

03:40:10.880 --> 03:40:16.880
settlement remains uh feasible but i think there are very legitimate questions

03:40:17.760 --> 03:40:24.800
about its desirability um and about whether peace can be achieved in the middle east

03:40:26.240 --> 03:40:34.720
with the persistence of an irrational genocidal apartheid regime particularly because israeli

03:40:34.720 --> 03:40:46.320
society is um uh beginning to develop um many extremely extremely uh distasteful

03:40:46.320 --> 03:40:53.520
supremacist uh dehumanizing uh aspects that i think also stand in the way of uh coexistence

03:40:53.520 --> 03:41:02.720
that are being fed by this uh regime so if you look back into history when we're closest to peace

03:41:02.720 --> 03:41:09.040
and do you draw any hope from any of them um i feel like in 2000 i feel like the deal that

03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:14.960
was present uh at least at the end of the top of summit i think in terms of what israel i think had

03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:18.480
the appetite to give and what the palestinians would have gotten would have definitely been the

03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:25.600
most agreeable between the two parties um i don't know if in 73 i'm not sure if the appetite would

03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:31.200
have ever been there for the arab states to negotiate alongside the palestinians i know that

03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:35.600
um in jordan there was no love for the palestinians after you know 1970 after black

03:41:35.600 --> 03:41:41.520
september um i know that sidat had no love for the palestinians um due to their associate

03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:48.080
association with the muslim brotherhoods attempted assassinations in egypt um sorry which plo and

03:41:48.080 --> 03:41:52.720
the muslim brotherhood sidat was upset because there were attempted assassinations by people

03:41:52.720 --> 03:41:57.600
and oh no an assassination um it was a personal friend of his yesuf al-sibai i can't pronounce

03:41:57.600 --> 03:42:03.520
that he was assassinated by a palestinian organization which was admittedly yeah he says

03:42:03.520 --> 03:42:07.920
as much belongs to the center group not yellow directly but i think that um there was a history

03:42:07.920 --> 03:42:13.200
of um the palestinians sometimes uh fighting with their neighboring states that were hosting them

03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:17.280
if they weren't getting the political concessions they wanted um the assassination of the jordanian

03:42:17.280 --> 03:42:22.640
king in 51 might be another example of that in jordan um it feels like over a long period of

03:42:22.640 --> 03:42:27.280
time it feels like the palestinians have been kind of told from the neighboring arab states

03:42:27.280 --> 03:42:33.120
that if they just continue to enact violence whether in israel or abroad that eventually a

03:42:33.120 --> 03:42:37.920
state will materialize somehow i don't think it's gotten them any closer to a state if anything i

03:42:37.920 --> 03:42:42.240
think it's taken them farther and farther and farther away from one and i think as long as the

03:42:42.240 --> 03:42:46.880
hyperbolic language is continually employed internationally the idea that israel is committing

03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:51.280
a genocide the idea that there is an apartheid the idea that they live in a concentration camp

03:42:51.280 --> 03:42:55.440
all of these words i think further the narrative for the palestinians that israel is an evil state

03:42:55.440 --> 03:42:59.360
that needs to be dismantled i mean you said as much about the institution at least to the

03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:03.360
zionist government israel's government is probably not going anywhere all of the other surrounding

03:43:03.360 --> 03:43:07.600
arab states have accepted that or at least most of them down in the gulf egypt and jordan have

03:43:07.600 --> 03:43:12.800
accepted that the palestinians need to accept it too the the israeli state or the state apparatus

03:43:12.800 --> 03:43:16.480
is not going anywhere and at some point they need to realize like hey we need a leader that's going

03:43:16.480 --> 03:43:21.280
to come out and represent us represent all of us is when we take political risks is willing to

03:43:21.280 --> 03:43:26.720
negotiate some lasting peace for us and it's not going to be the international community or some

03:43:26.720 --> 03:43:30.880
invocation of international law or some invocation of morality or justice that's

03:43:30.880 --> 03:43:34.560
going to extricate us from this conflict it's going to take some actual difficult political

03:43:34.560 --> 03:43:41.040
maneuvering on the ground of accepting israel of accepting israel which they formally did in 1993

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:46.880
which they formally did in 1993 yeah but then no no lasting peace came after that in 2000

03:43:46.880 --> 03:43:52.320
no because 1993 was not a peace agreement sure the oslo courts were were an interim

03:43:52.320 --> 03:43:57.840
final solution were an interim an interim agreement and palestinians actually began

03:43:58.480 --> 03:44:07.360
clamoring for commencing the permanent status resolutions on schedule and the israelis kept

03:44:07.360 --> 03:44:15.040
delaying them in fact they only began i believe in 99 under american pressure on on the israelis

03:44:15.040 --> 03:44:22.640
and you're being a bit one-sided both sides didn't fulfill the promise of oslo and the steps

03:44:22.640 --> 03:44:28.000
needed for oslo there was palestinian terrorism which accompanied israel's expansion of settlements

03:44:28.000 --> 03:44:34.560
and other things the two things fed each other and they led to what happened in 2000 which was a

03:44:34.560 --> 03:44:39.520
breakdown of the talks all together when the palestinians said no but i i think there's a

03:44:39.680 --> 03:44:44.640
i don't i don't agree incidentally with this definition of israel or the israeli state as

03:44:44.640 --> 03:44:49.920
apartheid it's not there is a some sort of apartheid going on in the west bank the israeli

03:44:49.920 --> 03:44:55.520
regime itself is not an apartheid regime this is nonsense by any definition of apartheid which

03:44:55.520 --> 03:45:01.760
well by the formal definition i think it qualifies no it doesn't qualify apartheid is a race race

03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:07.360
based a distinction between different segments of the population and some of them don't have

03:45:07.360 --> 03:45:14.000
any representation at all like the blacks in south africa no no rights at all in israel in israel

03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:20.960
itself the minority the arabs do have representation do have rights and so on i don't think israel is

03:45:20.960 --> 03:45:26.640
also genocidal i don't think it's been genocidal it wasn't so in 48 it wasn't so in 67 and it

03:45:26.640 --> 03:45:32.240
hasn't been recently in my view and talk about dismantling israel and that's what you're talking

03:45:32.240 --> 03:45:39.920
about is i think steven said it correctly is counterproductive it just pushes israelis

03:45:39.920 --> 03:45:46.560
further away from willing to give palestinians anything please norm tell me you have something

03:45:46.560 --> 03:45:53.360
optimistic optimistic to say i uh even though i agree i've thought about a lot and i agree with

03:45:53.360 --> 03:46:02.080
muin's analysis i'm not really in the business of punditry i'd rather look at the historical

03:46:02.080 --> 03:46:08.400
record where i feel more comfortable and i feel on terra firma so i'd like to just go through that

03:46:09.520 --> 03:46:19.280
i don't quite i agree and i disagree with muin on the 73 issue after the 1973 war it was clear that

03:46:19.920 --> 03:46:29.600
israel was surprised by what happened during the war and um uh it took a big hit the estimates are

03:46:29.600 --> 03:46:34.560
i don't know what numbers you use but i hear between two and three thousand israeli soldiers

03:46:34.560 --> 03:46:42.080
were killed uh during the 1900s 2500 yeah 27 okay so i got it right i read different numbers that's

03:46:42.080 --> 03:46:48.400
you know it's a very large number of israelis who were killed there were moments at the beginning

03:46:48.400 --> 03:46:53.600
of the war where there was a fear that this might be it uh no no there wasn't there wasn't

03:46:53.600 --> 03:46:59.200
no this is nonsense everybody forgets israel's israel's atomic weapon i know but so how could

03:46:59.200 --> 03:47:04.240
they have been defeated didn't diane talk about the collapse of the third temple he did but it

03:47:04.240 --> 03:47:09.120
was hysterical and silly because israel had atomic weapons they wanted to stop the syrians or the

03:47:09.120 --> 03:47:12.800
egyptians but we're talking about perceptions yeah i'm not i'm not i can't tell you if he was

03:47:12.800 --> 03:47:19.200
hysterical or not no he was in the same room with him but i'm just saying let's not bog down on that

03:47:20.080 --> 03:47:27.200
the war is over and when president carter comes into power carter was an extremely smart guy

03:47:27.200 --> 03:47:32.800
jimmy carter extremely smart guy and he was very fixed on details extreme he was probably the most

03:47:32.800 --> 03:47:38.320
impressive of modern american presidents in my opinion by a wide margin and he was determined

03:47:38.320 --> 03:47:45.040
to resolve the conflict on the on the big scale on the arab israeli scale on the palestinian

03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:55.040
issue he wouldn't go past what he called the palestinian homeland he wouldn't go as far as

03:47:55.040 --> 03:48:01.360
a palestinian state i'm not going to go into the details of that i i don't think realistically

03:48:01.360 --> 03:48:06.080
given the political balance of forces that was going to happen but that's a separate issue

03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:11.920
let's get to the issue at hand namely what is the obstacle or what has been the obstacle

03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:19.280
since the early 1970s since roughly 1974 the palestinians have accepted the two-state settlement

03:48:19.280 --> 03:48:28.320
on the june 1967 border now as it got as more pressure was exerted on israel because the

03:48:28.320 --> 03:48:34.240
palestinians seemed reasonable the israelis to quote the israeli political scientist avner

03:48:34.240 --> 03:48:40.240
yaniv he since passed from the scene he said yaniv in his book dilemmas of security he said

03:48:40.240 --> 03:48:46.960
that the big palestinian big israeli fear was what he called the palestinian peace offensive

03:48:47.760 --> 03:48:55.440
that was their worry that the palestinians were becoming too moderate and unless you understand

03:48:55.520 --> 03:49:04.000
that you can't understand the june 1982 lebanon war the purpose of the june 1982 lebanon war

03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:12.160
was to liquidate the plo in southern lebanon because they were too moderate the palestinian

03:49:12.160 --> 03:49:18.400
peace offensive i'm going to have to fast forward there are many events there's the first intifada

03:49:18.400 --> 03:49:25.360
then there's the aslo accord and let's now go to the the heart of the issue namely the

03:49:26.480 --> 03:49:36.880
2000 2001 negotiations well um the negotiations are divided into three parts for the sake of

03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:45.120
listeners there's camp david in july 2000 there are the clinton parameters in december 2000

03:49:45.120 --> 03:49:53.840
and then there are negotiations in taba in egypt taba in egypt in 2001 those are the three phases

03:49:54.560 --> 03:50:01.760
now i have studied the record probably to the point of insanity because there are so many

03:50:01.760 --> 03:50:07.920
details you have to master i'll vouch for that the insanity yeah i i actually i will vouch for it

03:50:08.560 --> 03:50:16.720
i will personally vouch for it um there is one extensive record from that whole period

03:50:16.720 --> 03:50:24.400
from 2000 to you could say 2007 and that is what came to be called the palestine papers

03:50:24.400 --> 03:50:33.360
which are about 15 000 pages of all the records of the negotiations i have read through all of them

03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:41.920
every single page and this is what i find if you look at shlomo ben ami's book which i have with me

03:50:42.480 --> 03:50:51.520
prophets without honor it's his last book he says going into camp david that means july going into

03:50:51.520 --> 03:51:00.160
camp david july 2000 he said the israelis were willing to return about not return but will

03:51:00.160 --> 03:51:06.800
withdraw from 90 relinquish 92 percent of the west bank and i mean was that camp david yeah

03:51:06.800 --> 03:51:15.040
then he was at taba oh yeah he was also a camp david they wanted israel wanted to keep

03:51:15.680 --> 03:51:24.080
all the major settlement blocks it wanted to keep roughly eight percent of the west bank

03:51:24.880 --> 03:51:33.680
they were allowing for you put it at 84 to 90 percent uh in your books uh they put it at roughly

03:51:34.240 --> 03:51:41.760
92 percent uh israel was willing to give up how you calculate yeah it depends what stage camp david

03:51:41.760 --> 03:51:46.960
because there were two weeks i'm yeah i'll get to that proposals change during so israel wants to

03:51:46.960 --> 03:51:52.320
keep all the major settlement blocks means the border area of the west bank well not the border

03:51:52.320 --> 03:51:59.920
we have ariel we have malay adumim we have is condolence the right of condolence the rice

03:51:59.920 --> 03:52:06.640
called ariel she said it was a dagger into the heart of the west bank so they want to keep

03:52:07.600 --> 03:52:15.280
eight percent of the land they want to keep the settlement blocks they want to keep 80 percent

03:52:15.280 --> 03:52:24.240
of the settlers they will not budge an inch on the question of refugees to quote uh ehud barak

03:52:24.240 --> 03:52:30.000
in the article he co-authored with you in the new york review of books we will accept and i think

03:52:30.000 --> 03:52:36.320
the quote's accurate no moral legal or historical responsibility for what happened to the refugees

03:52:36.320 --> 03:52:42.800
so forget about even allowing refugees to return we accept no moral legal or historical responsibility

03:52:42.800 --> 03:52:52.480
for the refugees and on jerusalem they wanted to keep large parts of jerusalem now how do we

03:52:52.480 --> 03:53:00.160
judge who is reasonable and who is not then ami says i think the israeli offer was reasonable

03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:08.640
that's how he sees it but what is the standard of reasonable my standard is what does international

03:53:08.640 --> 03:53:18.080
law say international law says the settlements are illegal israel wants to keep all the settlement

03:53:18.080 --> 03:53:29.040
blocks 15 judges all 15 in the war decision in 2004 in july 2004 all 15 judges including the

03:53:29.040 --> 03:53:37.200
american judge bergandthal ruled the settlements are illegal under international law they want to

03:53:37.200 --> 03:53:46.000
keep 80 percent of the settlers under international law all the settlers are illegal in the west bank

03:53:46.880 --> 03:53:54.560
they want to keep large parts of east jerusalem but under international law

03:53:55.440 --> 03:54:02.480
east jerusalem is occupied palestinian territory that's what the international not palestinian

03:54:02.480 --> 03:54:06.480
because there was no palestine okay under there's never been a palestinian state

03:54:08.080 --> 03:54:14.560
i listened patiently to you sorry under international law if you read the decision

03:54:15.520 --> 03:54:25.840
all territory they're not 2004 war decision all territory beyond the green line which includes

03:54:25.840 --> 03:54:33.360
east jerusalem is occupied palestinian territory exception of the golan heights

03:54:33.920 --> 03:54:40.400
the designated unit according to the international court of justice the designated unit for

03:54:40.400 --> 03:54:48.960
palestinian self-determination and they they deny any right whatsoever on the right of return

03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:58.080
the maximum i don't want to go into the details now the maximum formal offer was by ehud omart

03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:06.800
in 2008 he offered 5 000 refugees could return under what was called family reunification

03:55:07.440 --> 03:55:15.040
5 000 in the course of five years and no recognition of any israeli responsibility

03:55:15.920 --> 03:55:19.200
so if you use as the baseline

03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:28.480
what the un general assembly has said and what the international court of justice has said

03:55:29.120 --> 03:55:39.440
if you use that baseline international law by that baseline all the concessions came from the

03:55:39.520 --> 03:55:48.560
palestinian side every single concession came from the palestinian side none came from the israeli

03:55:48.560 --> 03:55:59.600
side they may have accepted less than the than what they wanted but it was still beyond what

03:55:59.600 --> 03:56:07.440
international law allocated to them now you'll say it to the palestinian allocated to palestinians

03:56:07.440 --> 03:56:17.120
yes thank you for the clarification now about arafat like the mufti never liked the guy i think

03:56:17.120 --> 03:56:22.800
that was one of the only disagreements muheen and i had when arafat passed you were a little

03:56:22.800 --> 03:56:29.280
sentimental i was not never liked the guy but politics you don't have to like the guy there

03:56:29.280 --> 03:56:38.000
was no question nobody argues it that whenever the negotiations started up the palestinians just

03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:46.000
kept saying the same things no no i kept saying no no professor maris with due respect incorrect

03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:54.000
they kept saying international legitimacy international law un resolutions they said

03:56:54.000 --> 03:57:01.520
we already gave you what you what the law required we gave that in 1988 november 1988

03:57:01.520 --> 03:57:11.840
and then ratified again at oslo in 1993 and they said now we want what was promised us

03:57:12.960 --> 03:57:19.040
under international law and that was the one point where everybody on the other side agreed

03:57:19.600 --> 03:57:22.640
clinton don't talk to me about international law

03:57:23.760 --> 03:57:30.320
livni during the omart administration she said i studied international law i don't believe in

03:57:30.320 --> 03:57:38.560
international law every single member on the other side they didn't want to hear from international

03:57:38.560 --> 03:57:47.760
law and to my thinking that that is the only reasonable baseline for trying to resolve the

03:57:47.760 --> 03:57:55.600
conflict and israel has along with us when has international law been relevant to any

03:57:55.600 --> 03:58:00.080
conflict basically in the world hey that's why over the last time that's why the palestinians

03:58:00.080 --> 03:58:04.480
have to recognize israel because that's international law but international that was

03:58:04.480 --> 03:58:09.840
that was un resolution 242 by international law or in accordance with international law

03:58:10.640 --> 03:58:17.840
professor maris for argument's sake let's agree on that strictly for argument's sake

03:58:18.800 --> 03:58:28.320
what's the alternative dennis ross said we're going to decide who gets what on the basis of

03:58:28.320 --> 03:58:35.760
needs so he says israel needs this israel needs that israel needs that dennis ross

03:58:35.760 --> 03:58:44.240
decide to be the philosopher king he's going to decide on the basis of needs well if you asked me

03:58:44.960 --> 03:58:52.000
since gaza is one of the densest places on earth it needs a good yes it needs part of

03:58:52.000 --> 03:58:58.240
signage that's a nice big chunk of signage well not sign that's what it actually needs okay i

03:58:58.240 --> 03:59:04.480
i don't even want to go there uh it needs a nice big chunk but i have to accept international law

03:59:04.480 --> 03:59:13.280
says no okay international law is irrelevant now bernami says i think the israeli offer was

03:59:13.280 --> 03:59:20.320
reasonable okay that's your reasonable guy that's he seems even though okay i don't want to go there

03:59:20.320 --> 03:59:28.560
i've debated him and partly agree with you um but who decides what's reasonable i think the

03:59:28.560 --> 03:59:36.400
international community in its political uh incarnation the general assembly the security

03:59:36.400 --> 03:59:42.960
council all those un security council resolutions saying the settlements are illegal annexation of

03:59:42.960 --> 03:59:50.160
east jerusalem is null and void and the international court of justice that to me is

03:59:50.160 --> 03:59:56.880
a reasonable standard and by that standard the palestinians were asked to make concessions which

03:59:56.880 --> 04:00:02.080
i consider unreasonable or the international community considers unreasonable i think that

04:00:02.080 --> 04:00:07.600
the issue is when you apply international law or international standards i i wouldn't say what

04:00:07.600 --> 04:00:11.760
benny more says that they're irrelevant but i think that these have to be seen as informing

04:00:11.760 --> 04:00:15.600
the conversation i don't think these are the final shape of the conversation i don't think

04:00:15.600 --> 04:00:21.120
historically israel has ever negotiated within the strict bounds of whether we're talking resolution

04:00:21.120 --> 04:00:26.240
242 whether we're talking about any general assembly resolutions that's just not how these

04:00:26.240 --> 04:00:30.160
negotiations tend to go you might consider international opinion on things but at the end

04:00:30.160 --> 04:00:33.840
of the day it's the bilateral negotiations oftentimes historically started in secret

04:00:33.840 --> 04:00:38.400
independent of the international community that end up shaping what the final agreements look like

04:00:38.400 --> 04:00:43.200
i think the issue with this broad appeal to international law is again going back to my

04:00:43.200 --> 04:00:48.480
earlier point about all of the euphemistic words all it simply does is drive palestinian expectations

04:00:48.480 --> 04:00:54.320
up to a level that is never going to be satisfied for instance you can throw that icj opinion all

04:00:54.320 --> 04:00:59.280
you want it was an advisory opinion that came in 2004 how palestinians gained more or less land

04:00:59.280 --> 04:01:04.160
since that 2004 advisory opinion was issued so what would your standard be then both sides have

04:01:04.160 --> 04:01:08.480
to have a delegation that confronts each other and they assess the realistic conditions on the

04:01:08.480 --> 04:01:12.640
ground and they try to figure out within the confines of international law within what both

04:01:12.640 --> 04:01:16.560
sides are reasonable for but like for instance this statement of like full with retreat from

04:01:16.560 --> 04:01:20.320
the west bank was it 400 000 settlers how many settlers live in the west bank now probably half

04:01:20.320 --> 04:01:24.000
a million yeah you're going to include the Jerusalem suburbs yeah four or five hundred

04:01:24.000 --> 04:01:30.160
thousand people are never with the Jerusalem suburbs perhaps half a million people are not

04:01:30.160 --> 04:01:35.200
settlements i know that but that's not what the law the law calls it null and void let me we can

04:01:35.200 --> 04:01:38.880
say we can say whatever we want that winter we're blue in the face but like there's half a million

04:01:38.880 --> 04:01:43.760
israeli people are not being expelled my response you're basically saying if i understand correctly

04:01:43.760 --> 04:01:48.400
there's only one way to resolve this and that is through direct bilateral negotiations probably

04:01:48.400 --> 04:01:55.600
yeah okay so or ideally but i've taken over your house okay you're not going to go to the police

04:01:55.600 --> 04:02:03.360
because you know the laws of only of limited value so you come over and sit in what is now

04:02:03.360 --> 04:02:09.520
my living room that used to be your living room and we negotiate the problem there is that you're

04:02:09.520 --> 04:02:16.560
not going to get anything unless i agree to it and standards and norms and and law and all the

04:02:16.560 --> 04:02:23.360
rest of it be damned so you need to take into account that when you're advocating bilateral

04:02:23.360 --> 04:02:31.440
negotiations that effectively that gives each of the party's veto power and in the current

04:02:31.440 --> 04:02:38.720
circumstances the palestinians have already recognized israel they have they have what you

04:02:38.720 --> 04:02:42.720
keep bringing that up like it's a significant concession and i don't and even if it's not even

04:02:42.720 --> 04:02:48.240
true it doesn't but it doesn't the recognition from palestine isn't doing anything for your your

04:02:48.240 --> 04:02:52.960
your must totally reject i'm not talking about how much is the majority in the among the palestinian

04:02:52.960 --> 04:02:58.320
people they won the elections in 2006 actually they won a majority of the seats yes exactly

04:02:58.320 --> 04:03:02.800
didn't win a majority of the votes opinion poll today says the majority of palestinians that sounds

04:03:02.800 --> 04:03:07.760
right support the hummus that sounds right absolutely rejects as well so if arafat the

04:03:07.760 --> 04:03:14.400
2003 1993 or whatever issued a sort of recognition it wasn't a sort of recognition

04:03:14.400 --> 04:03:18.880
of israel it doesn't it's meaningless it's meaningless it's meaningless any anyhow i don't

04:03:18.880 --> 04:03:23.600
believe that arafat was sincere about it does it matter what you or i think well most israelis do

04:03:23.600 --> 04:03:29.840
and that does matter okay so matter but hamas says no and hamas is the majority so for years

04:03:30.800 --> 04:03:40.000
the israeli and u.s demand was that the palestinians recognize uh 242 and 338 they did but you're

04:03:40.000 --> 04:03:45.200
saying okay we demanded that they do this but it was meaningless when they did it then the then the

04:03:45.200 --> 04:03:51.520
demand was that tactical thing yes then the demand was uh is uh the plo recognized israel tactical

04:03:51.520 --> 04:03:56.080
okay we demanded that they did this and they did it but it's meaningless and they never changed

04:03:56.080 --> 04:04:01.440
their charter the plo you may remember that in fact in 1990 supposedly abrogated the old charter

04:04:01.440 --> 04:04:06.480
but never came up with a new one no so there was no new chapter in 1996 and farouk kadumi said of

04:04:06.480 --> 04:04:13.440
course the old char is still in yes yes but the point is you know the palestinians demands are

04:04:13.440 --> 04:04:19.760
constantly made of them and when they and when they accede to those demands they're then told

04:04:19.760 --> 04:04:23.920
actually what you did is meaningless so here's a new set of demands i mean you know it's like a

04:04:23.920 --> 04:04:29.200
hamster it's like a hamster let me let me let me tell you what no no let me tell you what that

04:04:29.200 --> 04:04:34.080
will be told if you run fast enough you'll get out of the cage no no the bottom line is that

04:04:34.080 --> 04:04:41.600
israel would like a palestinian sadat it wants the palestinians listen listen this is really a

04:04:41.600 --> 04:04:47.520
worst case scenario okay let me just because they shot so that but anyhow the the the israelis want

04:04:47.600 --> 04:04:55.440
for a good reason the palestinians israelis want the palestinians to actually accept the legitimacy

04:04:55.440 --> 04:05:00.640
of the state of israel and the zionist project and then live side by side with them in two states

04:05:00.640 --> 04:05:04.960
that's what the israelis i don't even know what is the i don't even know if that's true today and

04:05:04.960 --> 04:05:09.760
what is the formal position of of of this israeli government no no i'm saying i don't know if it

04:05:09.760 --> 04:05:14.640
okay it's pretty it's predecessor and it's predecessor and it's predecessor come on that's

04:05:14.640 --> 04:05:19.600
what israelis want they want a change of psyche of psyche among the palestinians and if that

04:05:19.600 --> 04:05:25.840
doesn't happen there won't be a palestinian state there just won't be muin has an interesting point

04:05:27.040 --> 04:05:31.360
because i've i found i found i know you would want to i know you want to forget it just like

04:05:31.360 --> 04:05:35.520
you want to forget the genocide charge but i know you want to forget that well the palestinians want

04:05:35.520 --> 04:05:39.680
to forget it too when it doesn't suit them as well but here's the problem and it's exactly the

04:05:39.680 --> 04:05:44.960
problem that muin just brought up now i read carefully your book one state two states with

04:05:44.960 --> 04:05:51.120
all due respect absolutely a disgrace coming coming from you coming from you most reviewers

04:05:51.120 --> 04:05:55.920
didn't agree with you yeah coming from you was like you wrote it in your sleep it's nothing

04:05:55.920 --> 04:06:00.640
compared to what you wrote before i don't know why you did it in my opinion you ruined your

04:06:00.640 --> 04:06:06.720
reputation not totally but you undermined it with that book but let's get to the issue that

04:06:06.720 --> 04:06:16.080
muin wrote here's what you said you said formally you said yes it's true the palestinians recognize

04:06:16.080 --> 04:06:22.480
israel but then you said viscerally in their hearts they didn't really recognize israel

04:06:23.440 --> 04:06:31.760
so i thought to myself how does uh professor morris know no what's in the hearts of palestinians i

04:06:31.760 --> 04:06:38.800
don't know i was i was i was explained i was i was surprised as a historian you would be talking

04:06:38.800 --> 04:06:43.120
about what's lurking in the hearts of palestinians but then you said something which was really

04:06:43.200 --> 04:06:53.120
interesting you said even if in their hearts they accepted israel you said quote rationally

04:06:53.120 --> 04:06:59.200
they could never accept israel because they got nothing they had this beautiful palestine

04:06:59.200 --> 04:07:05.120
and now they're reduced to just a few pieces a few parcels of land so they will never accept it so

04:07:05.120 --> 04:07:11.600
yes so you said there's no way they can accept no i would say that as well yeah the two states

04:07:11.600 --> 04:07:20.480
so the past proposal doesn't make any sense exactly as muin said you keep moving the gold

04:07:20.480 --> 04:07:27.360
post no no no until we reach the point where we realize according to benny morris there can't be

04:07:27.360 --> 04:07:33.040
a solution so why don't you just say that outright maybe why don't you say it outright

04:07:33.760 --> 04:07:42.800
according to you the palestinians can never be reasonable because according to you they

04:07:42.800 --> 04:07:49.680
want all of palestine according to you they couldn't possibly they couldn't possibly agree to

04:07:49.680 --> 04:07:55.120
a two-state summit because it's such a lousy settlement because they want all of palestine

04:07:55.120 --> 04:08:01.200
because you but you said rationally they couldn't accept it not their feelings it's both you said

04:08:01.200 --> 04:08:08.320
rational you went from formally viscerally rationally so now we're reaching the point

04:08:08.320 --> 04:08:17.840
we're according to benny morris the palestinians can't be reasonable because reasonably they have

04:08:17.840 --> 04:08:24.080
to reject two states they want all of palestine absolutely correct there's no way to resolve the

04:08:24.080 --> 04:08:28.560
problem according to your logic he said that himself he said they should dismantle israel

04:08:28.800 --> 04:08:35.600
that's what he said what i said what i said and and i've and i've written i'm glad you didn't deny

04:08:35.600 --> 04:08:44.240
it i've written extensively on this issue on on why a two-state settlement is um still feasible

04:08:44.240 --> 04:08:49.920
and i came out in support of that proposition perhaps in my heart you know you can see that

04:08:49.920 --> 04:08:56.320
i was just bullshitting but that's what i actually wrote that was a number of years ago and and just

04:08:56.320 --> 04:09:04.240
as a matter of historical record um beginning in the early 1970s um there was fierce debate

04:09:04.240 --> 04:09:10.720
within the palestinian national movement about whether to accept or reject and and there were

04:09:10.720 --> 04:09:15.760
three schools of thought there was one that would accept nothing less than the total liberation of

04:09:15.760 --> 04:09:21.760
palestine there was a second that accepted what was called the establishment of a fighting national

04:09:21.760 --> 04:09:27.360
authority on palestinian soil which they saw as the beginning as a springboard for the total

04:09:27.360 --> 04:09:33.040
liberation of palestine and there was a third school that believed that under current dynamics

04:09:33.040 --> 04:09:39.920
and so on that that um they should go for a two-state settlement and and our friend and

04:09:39.920 --> 04:09:47.200
correspondent kauter lowers has written a very perceptive article on um when the peel already in

04:09:47.200 --> 04:09:57.520
1976 came out in open support of a um two-state uh resolution at the security council PLO accepted

04:09:57.520 --> 04:10:03.840
it israel of course rejected it but the resolution didn't pass because the us and the uk vetoed it

04:10:03.840 --> 04:10:10.960
it was both of them i think it was nine to five ah okay yeah but but the fact of the matter is

04:10:11.760 --> 04:10:19.920
that the PLO came to accept um a two-state settlement why they did it i think is irrelevant

04:10:20.800 --> 04:10:27.600
um and subsequently the PLO acted on the basis of seeking to achieve a two-state settlement the

04:10:27.600 --> 04:10:34.720
reason i think and i think norm you've written about this the reason that arafat was so insistent

04:10:35.440 --> 04:10:43.840
on getting um the minimally acceptable terms for a two-state settlement at camp david and afterwards

04:10:43.840 --> 04:10:49.120
was precisely because he knew that once he signed that was all the palestinians were going to get

04:10:49.680 --> 04:10:56.000
if his intention had been you know i'm not accepting israel i simply want to springboard

04:10:56.000 --> 04:11:00.960
he would have accepted a palestinian state in jericho but he didn't he insisted i've ever

04:11:00.960 --> 04:11:06.640
understood he should have logically accepted the springboard and then from there launched his next

04:11:06.640 --> 04:11:13.120
stage well understand he should have done that international law would put a real constraint on

04:11:13.120 --> 04:11:18.800
him no but once he accepted it was over he was incapable of signing well i don't know that if

04:11:18.800 --> 04:11:25.120
that's right that he should have accepted it but if you're correct okay that that he was really

04:11:25.120 --> 04:11:30.240
out to eliminate israel then then he wouldn't have cared about the borders he wouldn't have

04:11:30.240 --> 04:11:34.320
cared about what the thing said about refugees he would have gotten a sovereign state and used

04:11:34.320 --> 04:11:39.600
that to achieve that purpose but but i think it was precisely because he recognized that he was

04:11:39.600 --> 04:11:45.680
not negotiating for a springboard he was negotiating permanent status that he was such a stickler

04:11:46.400 --> 04:11:53.200
about the details the second just as a factual matter he wasn't such a stickler when they asked

04:11:53.200 --> 04:11:58.560
him how many refugees the numbers it was a principle rather than the principle he said

04:11:58.560 --> 04:12:07.040
i would be pragmatic about it yes and the numbers that were used at um anapolis were between 100 and

04:12:07.040 --> 04:12:15.440
250 000 refugees over 10 years that was the number arafat when he was asked at camp david

04:12:15.440 --> 04:12:21.440
he kept saying i care about the lebanese uh the palestinian refugees in lebanon which came to

04:12:21.440 --> 04:12:28.240
about 300 priority which was a large concession from the whether you accept the number or not

04:12:28.480 --> 04:12:36.080
he wasn't talking about six million he was talking about between 100 and 250 000 over 10 years

04:12:36.080 --> 04:12:40.880
now the best offer that came from the palestinians excuse me the best offer

04:12:40.880 --> 04:12:47.760
that came from israel was the omert offer can we just pretend like we didn't all lay out the

04:12:47.760 --> 04:12:53.840
exceptionally pessimistic uh view of a two-state holocaust like a two-state solution let's pretend

04:12:54.560 --> 04:13:00.000
that in five years and 10 years a two-state peace settlement is reached

04:13:01.520 --> 04:13:06.320
and and as historians you'll still be here and writing about it 20 years from now

04:13:06.320 --> 04:13:11.840
how would it have happened i think that historically i think that the big issue is i

04:13:11.840 --> 04:13:15.920
think that both sides have had their own internal motivations to fight because they feel like they

04:13:15.920 --> 04:13:20.720
have something to gain from it but i think as time has gone on unfortunately the record proves that

04:13:20.720 --> 04:13:25.520
the palestinian side is delusional the longer that the conflict endures the worse position they'll

04:13:25.520 --> 04:13:30.080
be in but for some reason they've never had a leader that convinced them of that as much

04:13:30.080 --> 04:13:33.760
that arafat thought that if he held on there was always a better deal around the corner

04:13:33.760 --> 04:13:38.320
um abbas is more concerned with trying to maintain any legitimacy amongst palestinians than actually

04:13:38.320 --> 04:13:43.120
trying to uh negotiate anything realistic with israel that palestinians are always incentivized

04:13:43.120 --> 04:13:47.280
to feel like as long as they keep fighting either the international community is going to save them

04:13:47.280 --> 04:13:52.160
with the five millionth un resolution condemning whatever that another icj advisory opinion is

04:13:52.160 --> 04:13:56.400
finally going to lead to the expulsion of half a million jews from the west bank or that some

04:13:56.400 --> 04:13:59.920
other international body uh the icj and the genocide charge is going to come and save the

04:13:59.920 --> 04:14:04.400
palestinians as long as they in their mind feel like somebody is coming to save them then they

04:14:04.400 --> 04:14:08.400
feel like they're going to have the ability to get something better in the future but the reality is

04:14:08.400 --> 04:14:12.480
is all of the good partners for peace that the palestinians had have completely and utterly

04:14:12.480 --> 04:14:18.400
abandoned them uh egypt uh jordan uh the gulf states uh whether you're talking bilateral peace

04:14:18.400 --> 04:14:22.880
to the abraham accords most of the arab leaders in negotiating peace with israel have just not

04:14:22.880 --> 04:14:28.000
had as much of an interest in maintaining the uh maintaining the rights and the representations

04:14:28.000 --> 04:14:32.640
of what the palestinian people want and the only people they have today to to draw legitimacy from

04:14:32.640 --> 04:14:38.160
or to have on their side to argue with them are people that i guess write books or tweet or people

04:14:38.160 --> 04:14:42.400
in the international community that do resolutions or amnesty international reports and the reality

04:14:42.400 --> 04:14:46.160
is we can scream until we're blue in the face on these things none of it has gotten any closer to

04:14:46.160 --> 04:14:50.160
helping the palestinians in any sense of the word the condition has only gotten worse the settlements

04:14:50.160 --> 04:14:55.040
only continue to expand the military operations are only to get more brutal uh the the blockade

04:14:55.040 --> 04:14:59.360
is going to continue to have worse effects as long as we use international law as the basis and there

04:14:59.360 --> 04:15:03.920
isn't a strong a sadat like palestinian leader that's willing to come up and confront israel with

04:15:03.920 --> 04:15:09.600
the with the brave peaceful negotiations to force them to acquiesce nothing is going to happen and

04:15:09.600 --> 04:15:13.040
i think that the issue you come up with is you know whether it's people like norm that talk about

04:15:13.040 --> 04:15:17.680
how brave the october 7th attacks were or how much respect they have for those fighters the the

04:15:18.640 --> 04:15:23.040
israel in a way and i think people have said as much about netanyahu um the right wants violence

04:15:23.040 --> 04:15:27.040
from the palestinians because it always gives them a perpetual excuse to further the conflict

04:15:27.040 --> 04:15:30.880
well we have to go in uh in october 7th we've got a room of homas but we can't trust these people

04:15:30.880 --> 04:15:34.720
in the west we have to do the night raids um because of you know the second intifada uh you

04:15:34.720 --> 04:15:38.960
know it made us feel like the palestinian people didn't want trust with us i feel like that the

04:15:38.960 --> 04:15:44.480
the biggest thing that would force israel to change its path would be an actual a real not

04:15:44.480 --> 04:15:49.120
for like two weeks but an actual peaceful palestinian leader somebody committed to peace

04:15:49.120 --> 04:15:53.680
that is able to apply those standards and hold the entire region of palestine to those standards

04:15:53.680 --> 04:15:59.120
because i think over time the mounting pressure from without the the international community and

04:15:59.120 --> 04:16:02.640
the mounting pressure from within because israel hosts a lot of its own criticism if we talk about

04:16:02.640 --> 04:16:06.240
bet selem we're talking about like israel will host a lot of its own criticism i think that that

04:16:06.240 --> 04:16:10.720
pressure would force israel towards an actual peace agreement but it's never going to come

04:16:10.720 --> 04:16:15.040
through violence historically it hasn't um and in the modern day violence has just hurt the

04:16:15.040 --> 04:16:20.160
palestinians more and more if you paint a picture of the future now is a good moment for both

04:16:20.160 --> 04:16:26.320
palestine and israel to get new leadership that yahoo's on the way out hamas possibly is on the

04:16:26.320 --> 04:16:33.360
way out who should rise to the top such that a peaceful settlement can be reached the problem

04:16:33.360 --> 04:16:37.840
is like benny said yeah it's difficult because hamas enjoys so much widespread support

04:16:38.880 --> 04:16:42.720
amongst the palestinian people i think that the well i don't know there's opinions on whether

04:16:42.720 --> 04:16:46.960
democracy or pushing them towards elections was the right or wrong idea but with like an islamic

04:16:46.960 --> 04:16:51.680
fundamentalist government for hamas i don't know if a negotiation with israel ever happens there

04:16:51.680 --> 04:16:56.000
and then when the when the international pressure is always you know 67 borders infinite right of

04:16:56.000 --> 04:17:00.240
return for refugees and a total withdrawal of israel from all these lands to even start

04:17:00.240 --> 04:17:05.200
negotiations um i just don't see realistically that on the palestinian side no negotiations are

04:17:05.200 --> 04:17:11.280
ever going to start in a place that israel's willing to accept if you want to um dismiss

04:17:11.840 --> 04:17:19.120
international law that's fine but then you have to do it consistently you can't um set standards

04:17:19.120 --> 04:17:27.840
for the palestinians um but reject uh applying those standards to israel um if we're going to

04:17:27.840 --> 04:17:34.000
have the law of the jungle then we can all be beasts and not only some of us and i think

04:17:34.880 --> 04:17:42.320
so it's either that or you have certain agreed uh standards that that are intended to regulate

04:17:42.320 --> 04:17:47.760
our conduct all of our conduct not just some of us so that's a fundamental thing to abandon

04:17:48.320 --> 04:17:52.160
well you're saying you know international law and the millionth un resolution you're being very

04:17:52.160 --> 04:17:56.960
dismissive about all these things and that's fine but then you have to be dismissive like for instance

04:17:56.960 --> 04:18:03.040
across the board that was a chapter six resolution that's a non-binding but 242 is binding what is

04:18:03.040 --> 04:18:08.240
what is binding do you know anything about how the un system works if you read the language of

04:18:08.240 --> 04:18:11.840
the resolution binding is typically if it commits you to upholding a particular international law

04:18:11.840 --> 04:18:18.240
or if it establishes a new rule you just throw out words you hear binding does 242 even does

04:18:18.240 --> 04:18:23.520
242 mention a palestinian state no of course that's part of the problem that was the reason why

04:18:24.320 --> 04:18:28.160
didn't want to recognize 242 because they're only referred at the very end

04:18:31.520 --> 04:18:37.360
hold on every united nations security council resolution irrespective of under which chapter

04:18:37.360 --> 04:18:44.720
it was adopted is by definition binding binding not only on the members of the security council

04:18:44.720 --> 04:18:50.960
but on every member state of the un that's read the un charter it's it's black and white

04:18:51.040 --> 04:18:56.400
sure people look now regarding yes the language even of 242 is kept intentionally vague such

04:18:56.400 --> 04:19:01.040
that it doesn't actually provide again the final concourse it's incredibly because the term the

04:19:01.040 --> 04:19:07.440
term land for peace originates in 242 the idea is territorial acquisition and israel's need to

04:19:07.440 --> 04:19:12.320
give it up was kept vague that's why in 70 that's why 79 you asked you asked a separate

04:19:12.320 --> 04:19:18.320
obligations under two points of information allow me points of information yeah the first

04:19:18.320 --> 04:19:24.560
principle in un resolution 242 is that the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory

04:19:24.560 --> 04:19:31.760
by force which is meaningless it may be meaningless to you mr bernal okay mr bernal

04:19:32.560 --> 04:19:40.800
that principle was adopted by the friendly nations resolution the un general assembly in 1970

04:19:41.600 --> 04:19:47.600
that resolution was then reiterated in the international court of justice

04:19:48.640 --> 04:19:59.280
ruling advisory opinion in 2004 that was the basis of the coalition against iraq when it

04:19:59.280 --> 04:20:05.920
acquired kuwait and then declared it a province of kuwait which are supported that's what's called

04:20:05.920 --> 04:20:13.680
that's what i'm not gonna go there i'm not gonna go there it's not accurate

04:20:13.680 --> 04:20:20.240
that arafat endorsed okay i'm not gonna go there okay uh it's called under international law use

04:20:20.240 --> 04:20:26.720
kogan's or peremptory norms of international law the inadmissibility of the acquisition of

04:20:26.720 --> 04:20:34.720
territory by war that is not controversial it's not vague you couldn't put it more succinctly

04:20:34.720 --> 04:20:40.320
you cannot acquire territory by force under international law on the west bank before

04:20:43.520 --> 04:20:49.840
mr bernal don't change the subject if you don't know what you're talking about at least

04:20:50.960 --> 04:20:56.160
at least have the humility you talk about chapter six you don't know how close has

04:20:56.160 --> 04:21:02.080
242 gotten to the palestinian peace from tweet five you have no idea what you're talking about

04:21:02.080 --> 04:21:08.880
it's just so embarrassing at least have some humility between us we've read maybe 10,000

04:21:08.880 --> 04:21:16.000
books on the topic and you've read two wikipedia entries and you start talking about chapter six

04:21:16.000 --> 04:21:20.480
do you know what chapter seven is you know what chapter seven answer me question how close is

04:21:20.480 --> 04:21:25.600
242 gotten the palestinians to a state how close is the 2004 advisory opinion gotten the the west

04:21:25.600 --> 04:21:30.640
bank settlement what's your alternative the alternative is not this whatever this making

04:21:30.640 --> 04:21:35.200
money off the conflict is the the actual alternative the actual you should talk about

04:21:35.200 --> 04:21:41.440
making money yeah you're a media you go and talk to 50 million different people but he has a point

04:21:41.440 --> 04:21:46.640
the issue is you have all these resolutions have gotten the palestinians no closer to a state

04:21:46.640 --> 04:21:50.960
because they haven't been enforced because of the u.s veto they're not gonna be enforced

04:21:50.960 --> 04:21:56.800
well wait wait wait okay no if i may if i may you know you know what you know what professor

04:21:56.800 --> 04:22:02.080
morris about the case for genocide professor morris because of your logic and i'm not

04:22:02.080 --> 04:22:10.720
disputing it that's why october 7 happened oh my god because there was no options left for those

04:22:10.720 --> 04:22:22.720
people exactly what my options are left after you know listen listen to this is now an expert on

04:22:22.720 --> 04:22:44.640
palestinian mentality you're contradicting you're contradicting yourself on the one hand

04:22:45.200 --> 04:22:50.080
you're saying all the palestinians do is fight and violence and terrorism and all the rest of it

04:22:50.080 --> 04:22:57.120
but on the other hand you're saying they're expecting salvation from uh from un resolutions

04:22:57.120 --> 04:23:01.920
and international court those aren't violent they're no but it's part of maintaining it's the it's

04:23:01.920 --> 04:23:07.360
the continual putting off of negotiating any solution they've negotiated as in when arafat

04:23:07.360 --> 04:23:18.640
i think

04:23:28.320 --> 04:23:33.120
you can quote arafat talking about how he's lying and he's just going to use in 94 and 95 when he's

04:23:33.120 --> 04:23:38.480
making trips around the world starting ground i i'm sorry i can talk so you can watch youtube

04:23:38.480 --> 04:23:42.240
videos slow down to 0.5 speed if you don't understand what i'm saying let me there's a very

04:23:42.240 --> 04:23:47.520
there's a very lengthy history of israeli palestinian negotiations you want to deny

04:23:47.520 --> 04:23:53.280
that those negotiations took place where it feels like there was a good faith effort where there was

04:23:53.280 --> 04:23:59.760
a good faith effort where it was a good faith effort we all do respect mr pop history you can't

04:23:59.760 --> 04:24:03.440
even read the written records i don't know why you're referring excuse me i just said there are

04:24:03.440 --> 04:24:08.880
15 000 pages on anapolis and i'm sure you cherry clicked your favorite quotes from all of them

04:24:08.880 --> 04:24:15.840
okay that's great that's great at least i had a quote to cherry pick all you have is wikipedia

04:24:15.840 --> 04:24:20.560
i gave you quotes all you have is wikipedia do you want quotes find me the information i think the

04:24:20.560 --> 04:24:24.560
palestinian cause has been furthered by any international law you can't do it i think the

04:24:24.560 --> 04:24:32.240
problem is is is different okay you you want to um say the palestinians were only fighting and then

04:24:32.240 --> 04:24:37.600
when i point out they've also gone to the court and the un say well all they do then is these things

04:24:37.600 --> 04:24:43.440
and you say they should be negotiating and i demonstrate that there was a lengthy um uh record

04:24:43.440 --> 04:24:48.480
of negotiations said yeah but they didn't go in good faith again you're placing the hamster in

04:24:48.480 --> 04:24:53.040
the wheel and telling him if he runs fast enough maybe one day he'll get out of the cage what was

04:24:53.040 --> 04:24:59.840
the best okay and please if i could just finish i i think the fundamental problem here is not what

04:24:59.840 --> 04:25:05.680
the palestinians have and haven't done and it's perfectly legitimate to have a discussion about

04:25:05.680 --> 04:25:10.320
whether they could have been more effective of course it could have been more effective everyone

04:25:10.320 --> 04:25:18.080
could have always been more effective the fundamental issue here is that israel has never

04:25:18.080 --> 04:25:26.800
been prepared to concede the legitimacy of palestinian national rights in the land of

04:25:26.800 --> 04:25:31.360
the former british mandate of palestine how do you explain taba summit how do you explain the

04:25:35.360 --> 04:25:40.960
of palestinian demands they this is well they just didn't want to give the palestinians all

04:25:40.960 --> 04:25:46.240
of palestine that's all no all of palestine you mean all of the occupied territories

04:25:46.240 --> 04:25:50.160
you're talking about all of palestine what is the occupied what is the occupied territories

04:25:50.160 --> 04:25:55.040
the occupied territories all of israel the occupied territories are those territories

04:25:55.040 --> 04:26:02.640
that israel occupied in june of 1967 palestinians often use that term to define the whole of palestinia

04:26:02.640 --> 04:26:08.080
show me not just the west bank could you show me professor maris in all the negotiations

04:26:08.880 --> 04:26:14.800
all the negotiations and all the accounts that have been written can you show me one

04:26:14.800 --> 04:26:19.760
one where the palestinians in the negotiations because that's what we were talking about

04:26:20.480 --> 04:26:27.040
wanted all of israel the maximum i can't say that because international community won't accept it

04:26:27.040 --> 04:26:32.720
so they didn't say it they didn't ask for it no the hamas did the hamas always said all of it

04:26:32.720 --> 04:26:37.920
hamas only negotiated with israel about prisoner exchanges and i know so we were talking about

04:26:37.920 --> 04:26:43.840
a lot of the palestinian people you will agree the only place i saw pieces of israel were the

04:26:43.840 --> 04:26:50.720
land swaps and the land swaps accounted for about two to five percent of israel nobody asked for all

04:26:50.720 --> 04:26:56.080
of israel why what do you mean they asked for all of israel in 48 they asked for all of israel in 67

04:26:56.080 --> 04:26:59.520
what do you think those boys were about you're not going to respond to anything i'm saying because

04:26:59.520 --> 04:27:04.720
you have no answer i'll respond to you that's correct okay mr binell we were talking about the

04:27:04.720 --> 04:27:12.960
diplomatic negotiations beginning with 20 2000 2001 can't pretend that the first task for israel

04:27:12.960 --> 04:27:16.800
was in diplomacy okay it was through war you don't know what you're talking about is the

04:27:16.800 --> 04:27:21.120
international law argument ever going to get the palestinians closer to state is the israeli state

04:27:21.120 --> 04:27:26.000
ever going to be dismantled do you think that's like realistic coming up ever in the next 20 years

04:27:26.000 --> 04:27:34.560
again i'm i'm posing a question um and the question is regardless of of of what's feasible or

04:27:34.560 --> 04:27:41.280
realistic today um the question i'm posing is can you have peace in the middle east with this

04:27:42.080 --> 04:27:52.000
militant irrational genocidal apartheid state and power i don't think so no okay and the question

04:27:52.000 --> 04:28:00.080
i'm asking is can you have peace with this regime or does this regime and its institutions need to

04:28:00.080 --> 04:28:05.840
be dismantled similar to what the examples i gave of of europe and southern africa how do you contend

04:28:05.840 --> 04:28:10.240
with the fact that most of the surrounding arab states seem to agree that you can yeah you're

04:28:10.240 --> 04:28:19.680
correct several of them most importantly egypt jordan have made their peace with israel i should

04:28:19.680 --> 04:28:27.600
add that israel's conduct since then has placed these relations under strain i i had very little

04:28:29.680 --> 04:28:36.160
i didn't take the reports of a saudi israeli rapprochement particularly seriously before

04:28:36.160 --> 04:28:43.360
october 7th the reason being that it was really a saudi israeli u.s deal which committed the us

04:28:44.000 --> 04:28:47.440
to make certain commitments to saudi arabia that would probably never get through

04:28:48.000 --> 04:28:51.680
congress do you not consider the egypt israeli peace deal legitimate then since

04:28:51.680 --> 04:28:55.920
is since the united states made a great financial contribution in egypt i don't think the question

04:28:55.920 --> 04:29:04.800
is whether that deal is um uh legitimate or not i think i think that deal exists but the point is

04:29:05.280 --> 04:29:13.520
whether you know the the core of this conflict is not between israel and egypt the core of this

04:29:13.520 --> 04:29:22.000
conflict is between israel and the palestinian people and the reason that israel agreed to

04:29:22.000 --> 04:29:29.920
relinquish the occupied egyptian sinai and the reason that egyptian israeli peace treaty was

04:29:29.920 --> 04:29:38.080
signed in 1979 is because israel in 1973 recognized that its military superiority

04:29:38.720 --> 04:29:44.160
was ultimately no match for egypt's determination to recover its occupied territories and that there

04:29:44.160 --> 04:29:50.000
would come a point when egypt would find a way to extract an unbearable price just israelis wanted

04:29:50.000 --> 04:29:54.720
peace well the israelis wanted not just because they were afraid of what egypt might do if you're

04:29:54.720 --> 04:29:59.600
talking about the average israeli citizen i think that's a fair characterization if you're talking

04:29:59.600 --> 04:30:04.720
about the israeli leadership i think they looked at it in more strategic terms how do you remove

04:30:04.720 --> 04:30:11.600
the most powerful arab military state simple points what was the terms of that egypt israel

04:30:12.400 --> 04:30:20.880
peace treaty international law egypt demanded every nobody cared about it allow me to finish

04:30:21.760 --> 04:30:26.160
every single inch nobody talked about international law

04:30:27.120 --> 04:30:33.760
begging and carter and sadat talked about the reality no professor professor professor maris

04:30:33.760 --> 04:30:42.000
professor maris i know the record they demanded as you know because you've written about it

04:30:42.880 --> 04:30:49.040
they demanded every square inch as you know they demanded the oil fields be dismantled

04:30:49.520 --> 04:30:53.840
the airfield no not dismantled they wanted the oil field wanted the settlements dismantled

04:30:53.840 --> 04:31:00.880
that was the settlements the oil fields in the airfield they demanded all three back you can't

04:31:00.880 --> 04:31:05.920
have what do you mean back the airfields weren't there with the egyptian that's incorrect what's

04:31:05.920 --> 04:31:11.680
you're incorrect they built an airfield the israelis built an airfield in the occupied

04:31:11.680 --> 04:31:16.560
cyanide and they wanted it back they didn't want it back wasn't theirs okay they wanted the

04:31:16.560 --> 04:31:24.400
territory in which the oil fields the airfields the settlements have to be dismantled yes begging

04:31:24.400 --> 04:31:30.720
said i don't want to be the first prime minister to dismantle a settlement but he did why because

04:31:30.720 --> 04:31:36.080
of the law no it was because of peace it was normalization the law had nothing to do with

04:31:36.080 --> 04:31:41.920
anything it was a negotiation between two states each of which wanted certain things palestinians

04:31:41.920 --> 04:31:45.680
not the law had nothing to do with anything as i said repeatedly in the negotiations you're not

04:31:45.680 --> 04:31:49.840
listening i know you're missing one point i've read the negotiations the law has nothing to do

04:31:49.840 --> 04:31:54.480
with anything there are two foreign relations of u.s volumes on it nobody cares about the law

04:31:54.480 --> 04:31:59.520
the palestinians kept saying we want exactly since they weren't there allow me to finish

04:32:00.320 --> 04:32:07.360
the palestinians kept saying we want what egypt got we want what egypt got yeah egypt got everything

04:32:07.360 --> 04:32:12.960
that's nothing to do with the law okay nothing and number two i'm not saying it's the whole

04:32:12.960 --> 04:32:22.560
picture but as foreign minister moysha dian said at the time he said if a car has four wheels

04:32:23.600 --> 04:32:33.840
and you remove one wheel the car can't move and for them removing egypt from the arab front

04:32:34.480 --> 04:32:38.160
would then remove any arab military threat to israel

04:32:40.320 --> 04:32:47.520
no the first part did and that's what the palestinians kept saying we want what egypt got

04:32:47.520 --> 04:32:52.320
yeah yeah that's true but forget international law and by the way nothing to do one last thing

04:32:52.320 --> 04:32:58.320
one last on a personal note the quote about sharm el sheik without peace yeah okay

04:32:59.280 --> 04:33:02.880
that's the only thing you ever cited from a book of mine

04:33:03.680 --> 04:33:11.040
you credit yes i was absolutely shocked at your betrayal of your people that was

04:33:11.600 --> 04:33:20.560
your reason it was i apologize for that i apologize all right well let me try once again

04:33:21.680 --> 04:33:27.360
for the region and for just entirety of humanity what gives you hope we just heard a lot of

04:33:27.360 --> 04:33:32.480
pessimistic cynical takes what gives you hope like war that's that's a good reason that's hope

04:33:32.480 --> 04:33:40.000
in other words the fear of war the disaster disaster war should give people an impetus to

04:33:40.000 --> 04:33:45.360
try and seek peace when you look at people in gaza and people in the west bank people in israel they

04:33:45.360 --> 04:33:52.640
should fundamentally no but fundamentally they hate war yes i think so what what gives you hope

04:33:52.640 --> 04:33:59.280
there's no hope no it's an extreme no i'm hey i'm not happy to say that of course you are it's a

04:34:02.400 --> 04:34:08.320
it's a very bleak moment right now because that i agree with i agree with israel believes

04:34:09.280 --> 04:34:16.160
it has to restore what it calls its deterrence capability i think you've written about it

04:34:16.160 --> 04:34:23.440
actually i just realized israel has to restore its deterrence capability and after the catastrophe

04:34:23.440 --> 04:34:30.160
of october 7th restoring its deterrence capacity means this part you didn't write about the

04:34:30.160 --> 04:34:37.360
annihilation of gaza and then moving on to the hezbollah so so the israelis are

04:34:38.560 --> 04:34:44.960
dead set on restoring that deterrence capability on the arab side and i know maween and i have

04:34:44.960 --> 04:34:51.840
disagreed on it and we're allowed to disagree um i think the arab side the lesson they learned

04:34:51.840 --> 04:34:58.480
from october 7th is israelis aren't as strong as we thought they were and that would be an

04:34:58.480 --> 04:35:04.480
unfortunate message and they that's really what they think and they think that there is a military

04:35:04.480 --> 04:35:11.760
option now and i think that that's a zero-sum game at this point and it's very very bleak

04:35:12.400 --> 04:35:20.320
and i'm not going to lie about that now i will admit my predictive capacities are not perfect

04:35:20.320 --> 04:35:27.920
are limited but for the moment it's a very bleak situation that i agree and i don't see right now

04:35:27.920 --> 04:35:36.480
a way out however at the very minimum permanent ceasefire and the inhuman and illegal blockade

04:35:36.480 --> 04:35:43.280
of gaza and uh why is it illegal they were shooting rockets at israel for 20 years why

04:35:43.280 --> 04:35:50.400
is that illegal to blockade gaza why why why why is it illegal i'll tell you why you don't rocket

04:35:50.400 --> 04:35:55.520
your neighbor you rocket your neighbor expect consequences i'll tell you why expect consequences

04:35:55.520 --> 04:36:05.280
but that works both ways i know and i know i'll tell you why because every human rights humanitarian

04:36:05.280 --> 04:36:12.880
and un organization in the world has said you know i said nobody cares about it is a form of

04:36:12.880 --> 04:36:19.600
collective punishment which is illegal under international law you think you think a blockade

04:36:19.600 --> 04:36:24.640
you don't understand the way the world works yeah and these things are irrelevant and you think

04:36:24.640 --> 04:36:31.040
confining because that's the blockade yes you don't confining confining a million children

04:36:31.680 --> 04:36:38.560
compiling that's the choice combining that's a million children in what the economist called

04:36:38.560 --> 04:36:44.480
okay a human rubbish sheep the economist supported israel in this war and continues to support israel

04:36:44.480 --> 04:36:51.760
but um international committee of red cross called a sinking ship what the un high commissioner for

04:36:51.760 --> 04:36:59.200
human rights called a toxic slum you think it is a slum you think that it's caused by the international

04:36:59.200 --> 04:37:05.680
law you think it's legitimate forget the law hey i know you want to forget the law it's the one

04:37:05.680 --> 04:37:15.280
thing that every is it's what every israeli fears the most what the law as sippy litany said i

04:37:15.280 --> 04:37:21.280
studied international law i oppose international law of course you don't want to hear about the

04:37:21.280 --> 04:37:27.840
law so hey okay so here's the thing yeah then don't complain about october 7th

04:37:28.560 --> 04:37:33.360
if you don't want to hear me if you want to say i got about the law all i said was they acted like

04:37:33.360 --> 04:37:40.160
barbarians there is no international humanitarian law there's no distinction between civilians

04:37:40.160 --> 04:37:46.240
and combatants there should be and so now you're doing what muin said you're becoming very

04:37:46.240 --> 04:37:53.280
selective about the law if you want to forget about the law hamas had every right to do what it did

04:37:53.280 --> 04:37:59.120
it had every right to do what it did according to you not to me because you want to forget the

04:37:59.120 --> 04:38:03.280
law do you still support the houthis shooting random ships absolutely okay that's a violation

04:38:03.280 --> 04:38:09.120
of international laws you play the same game absolutely and were there a power during world

04:38:09.120 --> 04:38:16.640
war two who had the courage of the houthis where there are power they had that kind of courageous

04:38:16.640 --> 04:38:20.800
to be bombing merchant ships while tens of thousands of people die actual starvation not

04:38:20.880 --> 04:38:23.280
the starvation that exists in the gaza strip where people

04:38:23.280 --> 04:38:30.320
before october don't die of starvation what about starvation in yemen don't have

04:38:30.320 --> 04:38:35.280
something better to do yes i know don't have anything better to do in three years

04:38:37.040 --> 04:38:43.680
shouldn't they be feeding you know 60 000 die why fight starvation why fight the western powers

04:38:43.680 --> 04:38:49.440
and israel when you should be taking care of your problems at home the houthis often the only allies

04:38:49.440 --> 04:38:54.640
of the dispossessed are those who experience similar circumstances don't you think that they

04:38:54.640 --> 04:39:00.640
should take care of the yemen yemeni problems as i'm very happy i'm very happy they're helping out

04:39:00.640 --> 04:39:07.520
the palestinians anyone who helps the people anybody anybody who comes to the aid of those

04:39:07.520 --> 04:39:14.320
suffering the genocide half of whom are children yeah according to the most current un reports as

04:39:14.320 --> 04:39:23.120
of today one quarter of the population of gaza is starving that means 500 000 children are starving

04:39:23.120 --> 04:39:30.480
are on the verge of famine they keep saying on the verge i have not i have not seen i have not seen

04:39:30.480 --> 04:39:36.240
one palestinian die of starvation in these last four months not one they're always on the verge

04:39:36.240 --> 04:39:40.480
they're on the verge they have been documented cases i haven't seen yesterday al jazeera said

04:39:40.480 --> 04:39:45.520
six and the day before that they said two so those are there okay that number probably dies

04:39:45.520 --> 04:39:50.640
in israel starvation also i don't think there's famine in israel there isn't there isn't in the

04:39:50.640 --> 04:39:58.880
gaza strip either it's something which is produced for the west there are infants dying due to a

04:39:58.880 --> 04:40:03.680
engineered lack of access to food and nutrition i don't think it's engineered i think the hamas

04:40:03.680 --> 04:40:11.920
stopped shooting perhaps or as you said engineered i think um amnesty excuse me human rights watch

04:40:11.920 --> 04:40:16.400
called it using starvation as a weapon that's called engineering okay that's what they did but

04:40:16.400 --> 04:40:20.480
you were pushed on this by colman hughes to bring up like an example of why is the gaza strip like

04:40:20.480 --> 04:40:25.120
what by what metric are they starving by what metric is it so behind the rest of the world

04:40:25.120 --> 04:40:29.600
you know if we're gonna bring up um i want to hear an answer that because he didn't answer it

04:40:29.600 --> 04:40:34.480
yeah i just called you from the humanitarian organizations they said one quarter of the

04:40:34.480 --> 04:40:39.520
population of gaza is now verging on famine for october 7th okay before i'm not going before

04:40:39.520 --> 04:40:42.800
october that's what you use that as justification for hamas fighting you say the conditions were

04:40:42.800 --> 04:40:47.360
unlivable they had i said to him so my question is what made it unlivable prior to october 7th

04:40:47.360 --> 04:40:52.800
what are the what are the metrics that you're using there were about five six or seven reports

04:40:53.520 --> 04:41:00.400
issued by uncted issued by the world bank issued by the international monetary fund

04:41:00.400 --> 04:41:06.480
and they all said that's why that's why they say why why do they say that's why the economist

04:41:07.440 --> 04:41:13.680
not a radical periodical described gaza as a human rubbish so tell me by what metrics

04:41:14.880 --> 04:41:18.560
if you're if you're a historian if you do all this work tell me what they said

04:41:18.560 --> 04:41:25.680
something he's not going to answer again i i don't think i've avoided any of your questions

04:41:25.680 --> 04:41:31.200
except except when they breached when they breached the threshold of complete imbecility

04:41:34.560 --> 04:41:39.680
you remember what i said a moment ago i said to professor morris i defer to expertise

04:41:41.040 --> 04:41:46.240
i look at what the organizations say i look at what the united nations high commissioner

04:41:47.200 --> 04:41:51.600
you don't know you don't know you don't care okay i don't know do you know how complicated

04:41:51.600 --> 04:41:58.640
have you ever investigated how complicated is the metric for hunger starvation and famine

04:41:58.640 --> 04:42:05.120
it is such a complicated a metric they figured out if you asked me to repeat it now i couldn't

04:42:05.120 --> 04:42:09.200
do it and yet we have a human development index where we rank countries that we can still measure

04:42:09.200 --> 04:42:13.600
infant mortality life expectancy yeah we can measure all of these things

04:42:15.280 --> 04:42:19.360
i'm holding out for you here you still didn't answer the hope question what gives you

04:42:20.080 --> 04:42:26.640
a source of hope about the region well first of all i would agree with bennie morris and

04:42:26.640 --> 04:42:34.240
and norman finkelstein um that the current situation is bleak and i think it would be

04:42:35.040 --> 04:42:38.880
unreasonable to expect it to not get even bleaker

04:42:40.320 --> 04:42:48.160
in the coming weeks and months and we now this conflict really it originated in the late 19th

04:42:48.160 --> 04:42:56.560
century it's been um been a more or less active conflict since the 1920s 1930s

04:42:57.200 --> 04:43:04.960
um and it has produced a tremendous amount of suffering and and regional conflict and

04:43:04.960 --> 04:43:13.120
geopolitical complications and all of that but what gives me hope is that throughout their entire

04:43:13.120 --> 04:43:20.880
ordeal the palestinian people have never surrendered and i believe they never will surrender to

04:43:20.960 --> 04:43:26.720
overwhelming force and violence they have taken everything that israel has thrown at them

04:43:27.440 --> 04:43:32.960
they have taken everything that the west has thrown at them they have taken everything that

04:43:32.960 --> 04:43:40.960
those who are supposed to be their natural allies have um on occasion thrown at them but um this is

04:43:40.960 --> 04:43:48.800
a people that never has and i believe never will surrender and um at a certain point i think um

04:43:49.760 --> 04:43:58.960
israel uh and its leaders um will have to come to the realization that by hooker by crook um

04:44:00.640 --> 04:44:08.080
these people are going to achieve their inalienable and legitimate um uh national

04:44:08.080 --> 04:44:15.520
rights and and that that is going to be a reality i i um as i was what do you mean by that you mean

04:44:15.520 --> 04:44:21.680
all of palestine is that what you mean no and and from the river to the sea well ideally of

04:44:21.680 --> 04:44:27.680
course yes um and and what i was an inalienable rights no what i was saying earlier and then the

04:44:27.680 --> 04:44:37.040
discussion got sidetracked is um that i did believe that a two-state settlement um a partition of

04:44:37.120 --> 04:44:47.520
palestine um along the 1967 boundaries um would have been a reasonable um solution because i

04:44:47.520 --> 04:44:56.800
think it also would have opened pathways to um further but now you believe what further non-violent

04:44:56.800 --> 04:45:03.120
engagement between israel and the palestinians that could create um other forms of coexistence

04:45:03.200 --> 04:45:08.240
in a federal or binational or or what do you think about refugees in regards to that do you

04:45:08.240 --> 04:45:11.840
think there has to be a resettlement of the five or six million whoever wants to like claim to be

04:45:11.840 --> 04:45:21.040
a senator i think i think there has to be an explicit acknowledgement um of uh of of the

04:45:21.040 --> 04:45:27.680
responsibility and the return and of the rights i think that in the framework of a two-state

04:45:27.680 --> 04:45:37.760
settlement i think a formula would need to be found that does not undermine um uh the foundations

04:45:37.760 --> 04:45:44.640
um of a two-state settlement and i don't think it would be that difficult because i suspect that

04:45:44.640 --> 04:45:52.480
there are probably large numbers of palestinian refugees who once their rights are acknowledged

04:45:53.120 --> 04:46:00.240
will find it um exceptionally distasteful exceptionally distasteful um to have to live

04:46:00.800 --> 04:46:05.440
among the kind of sentiments that we've heard around this table um today to be quite frank

04:46:05.440 --> 04:46:12.000
i mean i heard i you know i'm i was previously unfamiliar with you um and i watched one of your

04:46:12.000 --> 04:46:18.160
preparation videos a very disconcerting stuff i have to say you were explaining two days ago

04:46:18.160 --> 04:46:24.160
and the discussion about apartheid and how absurd it was that in your view jim crow was not apartheid

04:46:25.040 --> 04:46:31.600
jim crow was not apartheid but arab states not giving citizenship to palestinian refugees

04:46:31.600 --> 04:46:37.600
is apartheid that's what i meant with my earlier comments about white supremacy so my issue that's

04:46:37.600 --> 04:46:41.520
great the white supremacy come out and if i well hold on let me let me respond okay my issue is

04:46:41.520 --> 04:46:45.920
that i feel like we have jumped on this euphemistic treadmill and i think that's part of the reason

04:46:45.920 --> 04:46:50.720
why this conflict will never get solved is because on one end you've got a people who are now

04:46:50.720 --> 04:46:56.320
convinced internationally that they're victims of apartheid genocide concentration camp conditions

04:46:56.320 --> 04:47:01.600
uh ethnic cleansing they're forced to live in an open air prison um with all of these things that

04:47:01.600 --> 04:47:06.000
are stacked against them all of these terms that are highly specific that refer to very precise

04:47:06.000 --> 04:47:10.400
things uh and then when people like you said that they should nothing less from someone who doesn't

04:47:10.400 --> 04:47:15.440
think jim crow is apartheid i don't know who does because the problem is you're morally

04:47:15.440 --> 04:47:20.560
loading for you apartheid is when racists do bad things no right there's a there's a definition

04:47:20.560 --> 04:47:25.200
of apartheid that's great but there's a very clear definition top down racial domination

04:47:25.200 --> 04:47:30.400
enacted through top down like federal legislative policies or whatever means that i don't know if um

04:47:31.200 --> 04:47:34.400
i don't know if jim crow would have qualified for apartheid that doesn't make it any less

04:47:34.400 --> 04:47:39.120
excuse me tenkelstein i'm talking right now excuse me excuse me tenkelstein i'm talking to your

04:47:39.120 --> 04:47:43.280
friend over here um i don't know if it would have qualified as the crime of apartheid just like if

04:47:43.280 --> 04:47:46.240
israel were to literally nuke the gaza storm killed two million people i don't know if that

04:47:46.240 --> 04:47:49.840
would qualify for the crime of in your eyes probably not i don't well yeah but because

04:47:49.840 --> 04:47:53.760
genocide requires a special intent i think the issue is and instead of and i think this

04:47:53.760 --> 04:47:58.000
conversation actually is emblematic of the entire conversation i don't think anything i don't think

04:47:58.000 --> 04:48:03.360
answering well sure but you excuse me of supporting racism so yeah i think you did and you are i did

04:48:03.360 --> 04:48:08.640
it do you think i support jim crow laws look when the fact that you can't even answer that honestly

04:48:08.640 --> 04:48:12.880
it doesn't matter what say that 800 civilians were killed by by hamas you said well maybe 400

04:48:12.880 --> 04:48:18.480
were killed by israel no i know the number maybe you said 400 you co-signed the opinion

04:48:18.480 --> 04:48:23.360
no i didn't no i did oh well wait how many what do you i think the word was some that's what i

04:48:23.360 --> 04:48:27.040
heard no well you weren't listening how many people do you think approximately if you had to

04:48:27.040 --> 04:48:31.360
ballpark if you had to ballpark it how many do you think were killed by hamas on october 7th i think

04:48:31.360 --> 04:48:38.640
it's pretty clear that the majority of civilians that were killed 51 percent or 90 percent don't

04:48:38.640 --> 04:48:43.200
ask me to put a number on something i don't know very different intuition first of all are you when

04:48:43.200 --> 04:48:47.840
you say hamas do you mean palestinians or do you mean hamas specifically palestinian force i don't

04:48:47.840 --> 04:48:51.520
like to say palestinians because i don't think all palestinian civilians were involved no i'll say

04:48:51.520 --> 04:48:56.400
hamas islamic you had whatever you're out because that's how this discussion started you said hamas

04:48:56.400 --> 04:49:01.840
and i began to answer that and then bendy morris said actually he means hamas in addition to jihad

04:49:01.840 --> 04:49:07.360
and the others so so of the invading palestinian force how many do you think killed civilians

04:49:07.360 --> 04:49:11.760
versus the idf what do you think of the ballpark the percentage well the figures we have are that

04:49:11.760 --> 04:49:16.720
about a third of the casualties on october 7th were military that's not what i do third were

04:49:16.720 --> 04:49:21.040
what's your question how many what percentage of civilians how many were killed by the invading

04:49:21.040 --> 04:49:26.080
force i think i think a clear majority but i can't give you a specific figure if you thought it was

04:49:26.080 --> 04:49:32.080
closer to 51 percent or 99 percent we're killed by how how that because it's interesting to actually

04:49:32.080 --> 04:49:36.160
stay out of position it's interesting if you want to be completely agnostic on it that's fine

04:49:36.160 --> 04:49:41.840
complete ignorance because we don't know professor morris doesn't know louis rabani doesn't speak

04:49:41.840 --> 04:49:46.480
with absolute certainty that the idf is targeting and murdering palestinian children intentionally

04:49:46.480 --> 04:49:50.560
you see the double standard no i don't you see i know you don't know it's a rhetorical question

04:49:50.560 --> 04:49:57.840
obviously you don't know why because i look at the un report i looked at the gulf stone report no

04:49:57.840 --> 04:50:05.920
the un report on the great march of return in 2018 and they said that the snipers were targeting

04:50:06.560 --> 04:50:14.080
children medics journalists and disabled people just as they are now in this conflict exactly

04:50:14.640 --> 04:50:20.480
no uh more journalists have been killed in the last several months in gaza than in any other

04:50:20.480 --> 04:50:23.920
conflict

04:50:27.520 --> 04:50:31.120
agree that they operate in civilian uniforms that their goal is to induce that confusion

04:50:31.120 --> 04:50:34.960
but that's the the way that they conduct themselves militarily let me finish my point

04:50:34.960 --> 04:50:38.320
more journalists i understand have been more you want children in the

04:50:38.320 --> 04:50:42.640
he doesn't want to hear it so

04:50:51.600 --> 04:50:56.720
that's not virtue signaling because that's human i don't care about i don't care if a hundred or

04:50:56.880 --> 04:50:59.920
a thousand

04:51:06.640 --> 04:51:13.040
muin mentions that more journalists were killed in gaza than in all of world war two doesn't get

04:51:13.040 --> 04:51:19.360
it that doesn't matter any part of more medics were killed that's silly and then he says it's

04:51:20.000 --> 04:51:26.560
an area but when israelis get killed that's serious i never said it's serious on both sides

04:51:29.680 --> 04:51:34.400
i'm not i'm asking a substantive question of who do you assign blame to or do you plan to

04:51:34.400 --> 04:51:38.560
norm finkelstein's conspiracies that the ambulances should have known immediately who was dead that

04:51:38.560 --> 04:51:43.440
the numbers were changed because they were fake or that maybe 51 percent of the people were killed

04:51:43.440 --> 04:51:48.960
by uh by hamas and islamic jihad but 29 percent were killed by ids helicopters you asked me direct

04:51:48.960 --> 04:51:53.840
question and you got a direct answer i didn't i got majority which could be i said a clear i said

04:51:53.840 --> 04:51:59.280
a clear majority what percent is a clear majority as opposed to always they live in ambiguity in my

04:51:59.280 --> 04:52:06.640
view is well over 50 please don't ask me to be more precise because you could say 80 90 95 i don't if

04:52:06.640 --> 04:52:12.240
i knew that i would say it i think it's reasonable it's a reasonable perhaps it is but i you're not

04:52:12.240 --> 04:52:18.720
the best person to be asking that question you know i read when you wrote up describe operation

04:52:18.720 --> 04:52:23.920
defensive shield and you said a few dozen homes were destroyed you're talking about what happened

04:52:23.920 --> 04:52:30.240
in june refugee camp and you said no the arab said 500 you guys said 500 you said palestinians

04:52:30.240 --> 04:52:36.320
were killed in june i never said no but that was the statement of the plo the palestinian authority

04:52:36.320 --> 04:52:40.720
you said a few dozen and that there were massacres there a few dozen yes a few dozen homes yeah well

04:52:40.720 --> 04:52:46.880
it turned out a 540 building buildings were destroyed five thousand five thousand people

04:52:46.880 --> 04:52:51.840
five thousand people were left homeless how many were killed five thousand how many you described

04:52:51.840 --> 04:52:58.560
it no i'm talking about homes destroyed so you're not the best person to be criticizing what muin

04:52:58.560 --> 04:53:03.760
says when he says clear majority but he can't say more you know why he can't say more he doesn't

04:53:04.480 --> 04:53:10.880
doesn't know yeah yeah i understand that if i was trying to belittle i would give you a very

04:53:10.880 --> 04:53:14.880
different answer i would just say i don't know i do know the right phrase you know what the

04:53:14.880 --> 04:53:20.800
right phrase there would be the overwhelming majority were killed by arab gunmen and very

04:53:20.800 --> 04:53:27.040
small number were killed by israelis by accident or whatever that's probably that's probably that

04:53:27.040 --> 04:53:33.520
maybe i can i can stay with confidence a clear majority overwhelming majority you may be correct

04:53:33.520 --> 04:53:38.560
but i can't state that with certainty i think there's a very easy way to find out is to have a

04:53:38.560 --> 04:53:44.080
independent forget independent well of course you forget independence that doesn't mean anything

04:53:44.080 --> 04:53:49.520
the law independent is un high commission for independent human rights not necessarily just

04:53:49.520 --> 04:53:54.480
repeat the numbers they're all all from barbaric countries you know assyrian was the head of the

04:53:54.480 --> 04:53:58.640
un commission for human rights but if it wasn't an israeli it would have been okay he certainly

04:53:58.640 --> 04:54:02.880
would have been more honest than this course oh yeah from your perspective but to disagree

04:54:02.880 --> 04:54:09.680
with steven i thought this was extremely valuable uh and at times really like the the view of history

04:54:09.680 --> 04:54:19.520
the the passion um i'm really grateful that uh you would spend your really valuable time

04:54:19.520 --> 04:54:26.800
and just one more question since we have uh two historians here well just briefly

04:54:27.760 --> 04:54:34.880
uh from a history perspective what do you hope your legacy as historians benny and norm will

04:54:34.880 --> 04:54:40.880
be of the work that you've put out there maybe norm you can go first and try to just say briefly

04:54:40.880 --> 04:54:47.440
i think there's a value to preserving the record i'm not optimistic about where things are going

04:54:47.440 --> 04:54:54.960
to end up there was a very nice book written by a woman named helen hon jackson uh at the end of the

04:54:54.960 --> 04:55:01.360
19th century describing what was done to the native americans she called it a century of dishonor

04:55:02.000 --> 04:55:10.320
and she described in vivid uh poignant detail what was done to the native americans did it save them

04:55:10.320 --> 04:55:19.360
no did it help them probably not did it preserve their memory yes and i think there's a value to

04:55:19.360 --> 04:55:26.720
that you know there was a famous film by eisenstein sergei eisenstein it was either

04:55:26.720 --> 04:55:35.280
battleship potemkin or mother i can't remember which one the last scene was the czar's troops

04:55:35.280 --> 04:55:42.720
mowing down all the russian people he pans the scene not all the russian people yeah well he

04:55:42.800 --> 04:55:47.280
pans the massacre he pans the massacre but he could have killed a lot more

04:55:49.120 --> 04:55:58.640
and the last words of the movie were proletarians exclamation point remember exclamation point and

04:55:58.640 --> 04:56:06.320
i've seen it as my life's work to preserve the memory and to remember i didn't expect that anyone

04:56:06.320 --> 04:56:13.040
would read my book on gaza it's very dense it gives me even a bit of a headache to read

04:56:13.040 --> 04:56:20.480
at least one of the chapters you wrote a book on gaza and but i thought that the memory deserves

04:56:20.480 --> 04:56:26.880
to be preserved amen well i would just say very briefly unlike my colleague i think

04:56:27.840 --> 04:56:33.920
writing the truth about what happened in history in various periods of history if i've done a

04:56:34.000 --> 04:56:41.120
little bit of that i'm happy thank you no thank you benny thank you steven thank you muin thanks
