00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio,

00:02.600 --> 00:04.520
his second time on the podcast.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.940
He is a legendary investor,

00:06.940 --> 00:09.120
founder of Bridgewater Associates,

00:09.120 --> 00:12.440
author of a book I highly recommend called Principles,

00:12.440 --> 00:16.000
and also a new book called Principles for Dealing

00:16.000 --> 00:17.840
with a Changing World Order,

00:17.840 --> 00:20.480
that looks at the geopolitics of today,

00:20.480 --> 00:23.000
especially US and China,

00:23.000 --> 00:24.580
through the lens of history,

00:24.580 --> 00:26.120
providing a fascinating model

00:26.120 --> 00:28.200
for the rise and fall of empires

00:28.240 --> 00:32.200
that can be applied to the analysis of our world today.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.320
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.400
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:36.400 --> 00:37.560
in the description.

00:37.560 --> 00:42.080
And now, here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.240
When you look at the history of the world,

00:44.240 --> 00:46.000
as you have done in your new book,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.800
Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order,

00:49.800 --> 00:53.340
what is more important, more impactful, money or power?

00:54.400 --> 00:56.500
They go hand in hand.

00:56.500 --> 01:01.100
They support each other and they compete with each other.

01:01.100 --> 01:05.360
Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.

01:06.380 --> 01:09.600
That power has to do with all that they can buy,

01:09.600 --> 01:12.540
but it also has the ability

01:12.540 --> 01:15.980
to influence those with political power.

01:15.980 --> 01:20.260
So, and so you see this throughout history,

01:20.260 --> 01:23.120
this symbiotic relationship.

01:23.120 --> 01:28.120
You know, for example, between the royal families

01:29.680 --> 01:33.400
and the nobility and the church.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.160
So you see that group of people

01:36.160 --> 01:39.080
supporting each other in various ways

01:39.080 --> 01:42.480
and then wrestling around with each other

01:42.480 --> 01:45.900
for the money and power among that group.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.640
So the dynamic that's quite classic

01:48.640 --> 01:52.840
is you could look at the parties in power

01:52.840 --> 01:57.760
back in the 16th, 17th centuries.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.640
You would look at royal families, nobles,

02:01.640 --> 02:05.560
and the church, if you're in Europe.

02:05.560 --> 02:10.040
And then you would look at agricultural land

02:10.040 --> 02:12.240
and there was a certain dynamic.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.080
And that varies over time.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.960
It changes as those people get thrown out

02:18.960 --> 02:20.440
and technology changes.

02:20.440 --> 02:24.120
So when we evolved, when the society evolved,

02:24.120 --> 02:28.040
so that it would produce goods and services

02:28.040 --> 02:31.960
and you have something like the industrial revolution,

02:31.960 --> 02:33.560
the first industrial revolution,

02:33.560 --> 02:37.280
they have machines and you have the talent of people

02:37.280 --> 02:39.000
that are off the farms.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.440
And then you have a struggling for power.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.520
You see that power mix change.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.880
And so we don't see that same power mix anymore,

02:50.880 --> 02:53.920
but you still see the same dynamic.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.640
You see those with money

02:56.760 --> 03:00.600
dealing with those who have political power

03:00.600 --> 03:04.680
around those assets that are considered most valuable

03:04.680 --> 03:09.360
to particularly the productive assets that produce money.

03:09.360 --> 03:14.080
And political power is usually centered around nation state.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.880
So the major locusts of power is the nations?

03:17.880 --> 03:22.880
Yes, in 1668, after 30 years of war,

03:25.160 --> 03:29.920
there was the development of nation states.

03:29.920 --> 03:34.640
Before then, it was really the development of countries

03:34.640 --> 03:37.520
as we know it, that there were borders

03:37.520 --> 03:40.440
and that within those borders,

03:40.440 --> 03:43.960
those who had control got to control it

03:44.800 --> 03:48.080
and there were not to be intrusions in those borders.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.520
And that's how we established the nation state.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.440
And then of course, within each country, there is levels.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.640
There is a central level

03:59.640 --> 04:02.680
and then there is a typically a province

04:02.680 --> 04:05.360
or state level down below.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.000
And then there's a municipal level.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.680
So they each have different levels of power

04:10.680 --> 04:14.440
and it's the coordination of those

04:14.440 --> 04:17.920
that determines how the country is run.

04:19.240 --> 04:23.320
You write that the quote archetypal big cycle

04:23.320 --> 04:25.840
governs the rising and declining empires

04:25.840 --> 04:27.880
and influences everything about them,

04:27.880 --> 04:30.320
including their currencies and markets.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.760
The most important three cycles

04:31.760 --> 04:35.080
are the ones you mentioned in the introduction,

04:35.080 --> 04:38.200
the long-term debt and capital market cycle,

04:38.200 --> 04:40.520
the internal order and disorder cycle

04:40.520 --> 04:44.640
and the external order and disorder cycle.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.400
Can you describe this big cycle?

04:48.360 --> 04:49.640
There are two orders.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.320
There is an order, by order I mean a system,

04:55.320 --> 04:56.880
how the system works.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.600
So there's an internal order

05:01.600 --> 05:04.080
that is the internal governance system

05:04.080 --> 05:06.720
and it's usually set out in a constitution

05:06.720 --> 05:08.560
or some agreements.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.720
And then there's the world order, how the world system.

05:12.720 --> 05:17.720
So for example, in 1945, at the end of a war,

05:18.440 --> 05:22.280
which is basically a fight for determining the world order,

05:23.320 --> 05:27.640
the winners of the fight got together

05:27.640 --> 05:32.440
and created the world system as we now know it.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.960
44, they created the Brenton Woods monetary system

05:35.960 --> 05:38.640
that determined the money pretty much.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.440
And because the United States won

05:41.440 --> 05:45.280
and had 80% of the world's money, gold was money then

05:45.280 --> 05:47.200
and it has 80% of the world's gold

05:47.200 --> 05:48.800
and it was half the world economy

05:48.800 --> 05:51.480
and it was the great military power,

05:51.480 --> 05:55.280
the order was built around an American world order

05:55.280 --> 05:58.480
so that the United Nations was in New York,

05:58.480 --> 06:00.960
the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington

06:00.960 --> 06:02.760
and they built that new order.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.600
So classically, you have a war

06:05.600 --> 06:08.640
to determine whose rules were following

06:08.640 --> 06:13.400
and then you have the new order being constructed.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.200
After that, there is usually period

06:16.200 --> 06:20.760
of extended peace and prosperity.

06:20.760 --> 06:25.400
Peace suits prosperity and so there's not,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.000
and the reason you have the peace

06:27.000 --> 06:31.800
is because no one wants to fight with the dominant power.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.080
You know you're gonna lose, you've surrendered,

06:34.080 --> 06:35.320
there's been the surrendering.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.560
They carve up the world,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.440
they say what it's gonna look like,

06:38.440 --> 06:40.160
who's gonna control what

06:40.160 --> 06:44.680
and then you come into that period of peace

06:44.680 --> 06:49.680
and then prosperity where then there's a working together.

06:50.840 --> 06:55.840
Usually at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.640
you've wiped out a lot of the issues,

07:00.680 --> 07:02.960
the class warfare and so on

07:02.960 --> 07:04.840
and then there's good working together.

07:04.840 --> 07:09.840
So those great periods such as the industrial revolution

07:10.640 --> 07:15.280
in the late 1800s or what we've experienced

07:15.280 --> 07:16.960
in the post-World War II period

07:16.960 --> 07:20.280
are peaceful and prosperous periods

07:20.280 --> 07:23.560
led largely by the dominant world power.

07:23.560 --> 07:28.560
Over a period of time, since really 1500 and maybe before,

07:29.400 --> 07:34.400
but really 1500 when the Dutch invented capitalism

07:35.840 --> 07:37.040
and what I mean by that,

07:37.040 --> 07:39.640
they invented the first capital markets,

07:39.640 --> 07:42.520
the first stocks and the first stock market

07:43.600 --> 07:47.440
that since then capitalism has been an effective tool

07:47.440 --> 07:50.800
for building wealth because it got resources

07:50.800 --> 07:54.000
into the hands of inventive people.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.560
That's when we move from agriculture

07:56.560 --> 07:58.840
to the importance of inventiveness of people,

07:58.840 --> 08:03.520
they got resources and then they built that prosperity.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.000
In that process of doing that,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.080
they create wealth gaps naturally.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.840
Those who make a lot of money,

08:12.080 --> 08:14.920
make a lot more than those that don't

08:16.000 --> 08:20.200
and it also produces opportunity gaps

08:20.200 --> 08:25.000
because for example, those who earn a lot of money

08:25.040 --> 08:26.480
have that wealth,

08:26.480 --> 08:29.320
they have the power to educate their children

08:29.320 --> 08:34.320
in a way that others don't and the gaps grow

08:34.880 --> 08:38.520
and also the debts grow at that time.

08:38.520 --> 08:43.520
When they go around the world with their competitiveness,

08:43.840 --> 08:46.040
they earn a lot of money.

08:46.040 --> 08:49.000
So for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire

08:49.000 --> 08:51.080
learned how to build ships

08:52.600 --> 08:54.160
that would go around the world.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.040
A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle

08:58.040 --> 09:00.600
is the improvement of education

09:00.600 --> 09:04.320
and by education, I mean the skills that come from education

09:04.320 --> 09:08.720
but also civility, the ability to deal with wealth together.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.400
So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world

09:12.400 --> 09:13.760
and they had military power

09:13.760 --> 09:16.440
but they were also very inventive society.

09:16.440 --> 09:21.320
25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch

09:21.320 --> 09:23.760
and so as they went around the world,

09:23.760 --> 09:26.240
they also brought their currency

09:26.240 --> 09:28.280
and they brought their military.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.840
They needed the currency,

09:29.840 --> 09:32.760
they paid for things and that currency

09:32.760 --> 09:34.640
and then the more that happens,

09:34.640 --> 09:38.000
the more that becomes a reserve currency

09:38.000 --> 09:40.160
and then they have their military

09:40.160 --> 09:42.040
so they need their military strength

09:42.040 --> 09:45.960
and so you see it evolve in all of those ways

09:45.960 --> 09:50.960
but over a period of time as they become more successful

09:51.120 --> 09:55.160
and more expensive, they become more expensive

09:56.840 --> 10:01.840
and newer countries come along like the UK

10:03.240 --> 10:07.800
then learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch

10:07.800 --> 10:10.480
and could do that less expensively

10:10.480 --> 10:14.440
and also when they become more expensive,

10:14.440 --> 10:16.120
so less competitive

10:16.120 --> 10:19.080
and also the work ethic begins to change.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.640
They believe that since they're richer,

10:20.640 --> 10:22.640
they can enjoy life more.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.240
They don't have to work quite as hard

10:25.240 --> 10:28.040
and so you start to see the tilt

10:28.040 --> 10:31.160
and you start to see the development of the top

10:31.160 --> 10:34.360
and when you have a world reserve currency,

10:34.360 --> 10:37.000
that allows you to borrow a lot of money

10:37.000 --> 10:40.320
because those who want to save,

10:40.320 --> 10:41.920
wanna hold your money

10:41.920 --> 10:44.080
and that means that they'll lend you money

10:44.080 --> 10:47.120
and so those countries get deeper into debt

10:47.120 --> 10:51.360
so you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness

10:51.360 --> 10:56.280
and they get themselves into financial circumstances

10:56.280 --> 11:01.280
which are not good and they have large wealth gaps

11:01.440 --> 11:04.640
which set the stage for downturns

11:04.640 --> 11:06.720
and when they have downturns,

11:07.560 --> 11:10.120
the first question is do they have enough money

11:10.120 --> 11:15.120
and traditionally, money is resources

11:15.640 --> 11:20.000
so you classically see that the coffers are bare,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
that they're spending more money than they are earning

11:25.240 --> 11:28.920
and they run out of money in the coffers

11:28.920 --> 11:33.160
and their granaries are empty rather than stocked

11:33.160 --> 11:35.360
so that they give them the buffer

11:35.360 --> 11:40.360
and as that deteriorates, that worsens conditions

11:40.360 --> 11:44.480
and if they have a rival power that's also challenging them,

11:44.480 --> 11:48.840
they see greater internal conflict over wealth

11:48.840 --> 11:52.440
and then they have the problems internally

11:52.440 --> 11:54.120
and the problems externally

11:54.120 --> 11:57.680
which usually results in an internal war

11:57.680 --> 12:01.720
or an external war that leads to the change

12:01.720 --> 12:03.000
to the new world order.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.840
And to you, the Dutch Empire is a good example

12:06.840 --> 12:11.160
that the British, what are some of the key examples

12:11.160 --> 12:13.200
that you think about in the book

12:13.200 --> 12:16.320
of this process that followed the big cycle?

12:16.320 --> 12:19.200
Well, the leading reserve currency empires

12:19.200 --> 12:21.360
but it applies to all the empires

12:23.040 --> 12:27.720
were the Dutch, the British, the American and the Chinese

12:28.800 --> 12:32.640
but you could follow the same pattern.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.440
In the book, it was very important for me

12:35.440 --> 12:39.000
to not just use words and concepts

12:39.000 --> 12:41.360
because that's subjective.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.760
It was very important for me to use actual measurements.

12:45.760 --> 12:49.440
So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.

12:49.440 --> 12:52.000
You can see where's the education level,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.520
what is the military power, each one of those

12:55.520 --> 12:59.280
and you can see them back going over the 500 years

12:59.280 --> 13:03.360
and so you can see the arcs and the composition

13:03.360 --> 13:07.240
of those arcs and what you see is really

13:07.240 --> 13:10.760
in most countries and most dynasties, you can see that

13:10.800 --> 13:13.520
but you also can see through those numbers

13:13.520 --> 13:16.000
the health of those countries.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
Today, there are statistics that are in the book

13:21.840 --> 13:25.160
that show what is the level of education,

13:25.160 --> 13:28.280
what is the level of economic output,

13:28.280 --> 13:32.160
what is the level of military strength,

13:32.160 --> 13:33.640
what is the level of a number

13:33.640 --> 13:35.680
of different measures of strength

13:35.680 --> 13:38.040
so that you can then compare that.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.600
And I think that because they're objective measures

13:40.600 --> 13:43.320
of strength that you could see change,

13:44.400 --> 13:48.160
that shows the picture of where we are today.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.200
And I think one of the most important things

13:50.200 --> 13:54.360
about the book is that it allows people to monitor

13:54.360 --> 13:56.680
how those things are transpiring.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.760
I think for policy makers,

14:00.680 --> 14:03.200
are your policy makers doing a good job?

14:03.200 --> 14:06.320
And there's so much subjectivity in that

14:06.320 --> 14:08.280
but I think it's very simple.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.880
If those lines on the chart are improving,

14:10.880 --> 14:13.320
if your health index is improving,

14:13.320 --> 14:17.640
then you're moving toward a better life.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.280
So that's what the book works like.

14:19.280 --> 14:24.080
Also, it was used to create a model for the future.

14:24.080 --> 14:28.160
In other words, there are cause effect relationships.

14:28.160 --> 14:32.040
Everything that happens has reasons, causes

14:32.040 --> 14:34.840
that preceded it, that made it happen.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.000
And so by having all those in numbers,

14:38.000 --> 14:42.440
one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.

14:42.440 --> 14:46.760
So that's what you see in the book.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.920
It's not just, you know, raise interpretation.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.920
I didn't wanna make it raise interpretation

14:51.920 --> 14:53.840
because I don't know if I'm right.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.200
Yeah, so one of the fascinating things in the book,

14:56.200 --> 14:58.800
so you have list these 18 measures

14:58.800 --> 15:01.480
and there's like a little scorecard

15:01.480 --> 15:04.360
for the countries of the world today.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.760
Let's say US, China, and Europe,

15:07.760 --> 15:09.960
and what it was 20 years ago

15:09.960 --> 15:11.960
and looking at the change from 20 years ago

15:11.960 --> 15:14.480
and that's another indicator, the change itself

15:14.480 --> 15:17.240
to see where things are headed.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.560
Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective,

15:21.560 --> 15:24.120
how is US and China doing?

15:24.120 --> 15:26.720
And in the 18 measures, what are some measures

15:26.720 --> 15:29.480
that stand out to you as particularly important

15:29.480 --> 15:32.520
to think about today for the United States, for China?

15:33.440 --> 15:34.640
Well, there are a number.

15:35.760 --> 15:40.760
Financially, what you see in the United States

15:41.120 --> 15:44.840
is that we're borrowing a lot more money,

15:44.840 --> 15:46.680
creating a lot of debt,

15:46.680 --> 15:50.320
and we're printing a lot of money.

15:50.320 --> 15:54.440
And our capacity to do that is very much,

15:54.440 --> 15:55.800
is limited, first of all,

15:55.800 --> 15:59.840
because when there's a sale of a bond,

15:59.840 --> 16:03.760
when the government borrows more than it,

16:03.760 --> 16:07.400
borrows money because it spends more than it takes in,

16:08.360 --> 16:10.320
you have to sell a bond.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.880
And the world right now has a lot

16:12.880 --> 16:14.840
of US dollar denominated bonds

16:14.840 --> 16:17.280
because as the world's reserve currency,

16:17.280 --> 16:19.000
they sell, sell on them,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.640
and they have very bad returns,

16:22.640 --> 16:24.440
negative real returns,

16:24.440 --> 16:27.760
negative real returns significantly and so on.

16:27.760 --> 16:32.640
So that means that more bonds has to be sold

16:32.640 --> 16:36.720
than are bought.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.600
And that means that the Federal Reserve

16:40.640 --> 16:43.680
is faced with the choice of having to raise

16:43.680 --> 16:47.120
the interest rate to curtail borrowing,

16:47.120 --> 16:50.000
which slows the economy and hurts the markets,

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
or by filling that difference and producing money,

16:55.000 --> 16:56.920
the debt monetization,

16:56.920 --> 17:00.600
which produces an inflation in goods,

17:00.600 --> 17:03.440
services, and financial assets.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.480
So in that regard,

17:05.480 --> 17:08.880
that's the United States' position.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.880
In China's case, its balance of payments is better.

17:15.080 --> 17:18.560
China has displaced the United States

17:18.560 --> 17:21.720
as the world's largest trading country.

17:21.720 --> 17:24.400
In other words, more exports to other countries.

17:24.400 --> 17:29.400
And as a result, it's economically competitive,

17:29.760 --> 17:32.360
but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.760
It's a real blessing.

17:33.760 --> 17:37.520
So the United States, it has the world's reserve currency,

17:37.520 --> 17:41.040
but it is risking it because of this imbalance.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.040
So if you look at history,

17:43.040 --> 17:45.400
you see that those go slowly,

17:45.400 --> 17:49.040
but when they go eventually, they go quickly.

17:50.040 --> 17:54.760
So there's a risk of that financially.

17:54.760 --> 17:58.440
Then there's the issue of internal order.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.200
So I'm just giving you the major ones,

18:00.200 --> 18:02.640
but I'll get into some of the other ones too.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.840
Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict

18:06.840 --> 18:08.920
in the United States,

18:08.920 --> 18:13.280
which affects how well it works.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.600
In China, there's less internal conflict

18:17.640 --> 18:20.720
because it's a more autocratic state,

18:20.720 --> 18:24.440
but also they've created this bifurcation

18:25.800 --> 18:29.720
what is political and what is economic

18:29.720 --> 18:32.040
in terms of producing that prosperity.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.720
So if you stay out of the politics pretty much,

18:35.920 --> 18:39.640
and then you're seeing entrepreneurship,

18:39.640 --> 18:44.360
you're seeing the finances of new businesses and so on.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.880
And so that internal working,

18:48.040 --> 18:51.320
that's subject to different people's interpretations,

18:51.320 --> 18:52.560
whether they like it or not,

18:52.560 --> 18:54.560
but the internal conflict

18:54.560 --> 18:58.000
in terms of those kinds of measures is less.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.200
Sorry to pause on that for a second.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.960
So these measures,

19:01.960 --> 19:06.040
I guess you don't want to sort of romanticize

19:06.040 --> 19:07.840
any one measure or something like that,

19:07.840 --> 19:10.000
overinterpret any one measure,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.960
but is internal conflict always a bad thing?

19:14.480 --> 19:18.320
Is it a complicated calculation?

19:18.320 --> 19:19.160
Or do you kind of,

19:19.160 --> 19:20.600
the way we think about these measures

19:20.600 --> 19:21.440
that you've presented,

19:21.440 --> 19:24.920
we should be thinking like the higher, the better,

19:24.920 --> 19:26.560
the lower, the worse?

19:26.560 --> 19:27.560
I mean, of course, depending on the-

19:27.560 --> 19:30.360
Well, in many cases,

19:30.360 --> 19:33.880
the conflict that produces the revolution

19:33.880 --> 19:37.040
produces revolutionary changes

19:37.040 --> 19:40.560
that lead to resolutions

19:41.560 --> 19:43.640
and lead to new starts.

19:44.600 --> 19:49.600
And so a short-term civil war

19:50.360 --> 19:52.920
is a hellacious experience.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.560
And at the same time,

19:54.560 --> 19:58.960
it can be the transition to a new beginning.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.720
Also, there are different types of conflict.

20:03.760 --> 20:08.760
Competition, which makes everything better,

20:09.480 --> 20:12.800
is a productive conflict,

20:12.800 --> 20:16.040
whereas destructive conflicts

20:16.040 --> 20:20.960
are not good over the short time.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.640
So that's how those go.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.120
So within each measure,

20:25.120 --> 20:29.200
the story is complicated.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.320
Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear,

20:32.320 --> 20:35.200
meaning how much political conflict,

20:35.240 --> 20:38.840
how much social conflict.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.640
In other words, you can measure conflict.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.880
You can measure fighting.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.280
You can measure crime rates.

20:44.280 --> 20:49.280
You can measure lots of different ways of conflict.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.440
So the measures are a composite

20:52.440 --> 20:55.640
of different types of internal conflict.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.880
What are some other interesting measures?

20:57.880 --> 20:59.920
Maybe if you could also mention that,

20:59.920 --> 21:00.920
for me in particular,

21:00.920 --> 21:03.320
interest is education and innovation.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.840
Yes, the classic cycle,

21:05.840 --> 21:08.760
the most important leading indicator

21:08.760 --> 21:11.200
is the quality of education.

21:11.200 --> 21:16.080
Most importantly, broad-based education

21:16.080 --> 21:18.880
drawn from the largest population

21:18.880 --> 21:23.600
because you can never tell who the talent is going to be,

21:23.600 --> 21:25.080
where they're gonna come from.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.200
So for example, if you look at the Chinese dynasties,

21:28.200 --> 21:33.200
the great Chinese dynasties and the Confucian approach,

21:33.200 --> 21:38.200
it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams

21:38.560 --> 21:41.560
and so on a broad base of drawing in the populations.

21:41.560 --> 21:44.160
And you see that if you go across societies

21:45.120 --> 21:49.040
because that draws on the largest number of population

21:49.040 --> 21:50.960
to get education.

21:50.960 --> 21:55.960
And it also, that creates a reality and a perception

21:58.240 --> 22:01.280
that the system is fair, equal opportunity,

22:01.280 --> 22:03.000
not just one of privilege.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.360
And that helps to create social stability.

22:06.360 --> 22:11.000
But education is not just education

22:11.000 --> 22:14.200
in understanding facts and so on.

22:14.200 --> 22:19.200
It is education in civility of how to behave together.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.280
And so if they're smart,

22:21.280 --> 22:23.960
they understand how to be productive

22:23.960 --> 22:27.360
because they work well together and they're productive.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.240
And then that leads to the next stage.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.920
You could see in the lines in the charts,

22:33.680 --> 22:37.720
I plotted these so that you could see in a typical cycle,

22:37.720 --> 22:42.360
you could see that education is the long leading indicator.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.440
And then you could see, as you mentioned,

22:45.440 --> 22:47.720
that what you see is inventiveness

22:47.720 --> 22:51.080
and technology measures then follow.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.200
And you see then also competitiveness

22:54.200 --> 22:55.960
and world markets follows.

22:55.960 --> 22:59.160
For example, in the early stages of a cycle,

22:59.160 --> 23:01.480
the industries that they go into

23:02.520 --> 23:04.680
tend to be very basic industry

23:04.680 --> 23:06.280
because they have cheap labor,

23:06.280 --> 23:08.040
something like textiles

23:08.040 --> 23:11.360
and simple manufactured goods and so on.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.600
But as the education rises,

23:13.600 --> 23:16.360
then they move up the value chain

23:16.360 --> 23:19.680
to greater technologies and so on,

23:19.680 --> 23:23.200
which raises incomes and raises productivity.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.960
So yes, those, and as you say,

23:25.960 --> 23:28.320
there are 18 different measures like that,

23:28.360 --> 23:32.800
but education and then civility and the inventiveness.

23:32.800 --> 23:37.080
So you see it reflected in who's inventing what.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.800
And that corresponds then who's trading with,

23:41.800 --> 23:43.680
who's a big trading country

23:43.680 --> 23:46.200
and where's the value of economic output

23:46.200 --> 23:47.760
and what are per capita incomes.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.720
They all follow those arcs.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.760
Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book,

23:53.760 --> 23:56.600
so there's philosophy, there's wisdom,

23:56.600 --> 23:58.680
but there's plots.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.040
Yeah, you can see it.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.400
So it's not just your opinion.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.680
It's kind of like you can interpret it

24:04.680 --> 24:06.360
in any way you like,

24:06.360 --> 24:09.640
but you're just giving a lot of your own insights

24:09.640 --> 24:10.840
along with the numbers.

24:12.080 --> 24:15.640
If you were to look at the American nation,

24:15.640 --> 24:17.480
the American empire,

24:17.480 --> 24:20.040
and the trajectories looking into the future

24:20.040 --> 24:21.480
given these measures,

24:22.680 --> 24:26.000
what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse

24:26.000 --> 24:28.880
of the American empire based on these measures?

24:28.880 --> 24:30.560
What are the concerning indicators?

24:30.560 --> 24:34.520
And if those break down further, what does that look like?

24:35.560 --> 24:40.560
Well, all of those indicators are concerning,

24:42.520 --> 24:45.160
maybe except for one,

24:45.160 --> 24:50.040
which is technology, the technology niche.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.120
Although even in that area,

24:52.120 --> 24:57.120
the United States is improving at a slower rate

24:57.280 --> 25:01.720
than is China for various advantages that they have there.

25:01.720 --> 25:05.240
They put out about eight times as many computer engineers.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.720
They have free data and so on.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.600
But if you look at them,

25:09.600 --> 25:13.280
so the financial is a concern.

25:13.280 --> 25:18.280
The internal order, disorder is a concern.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.400
Then if you look at education levels,

25:21.440 --> 25:26.440
the United States is losing its educational advantage.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.120
If you were to compare it with China,

25:32.440 --> 25:36.960
if you take general public education in the United States,

25:36.960 --> 25:39.880
it's deteriorated tremendously,

25:39.880 --> 25:42.760
even in comparison to developed countries.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.880
There are scores, piece of scores and so on,

25:44.880 --> 25:47.880
and it's something like 38th in the world or something,

25:47.880 --> 25:51.440
and that was a big plunge, average public education.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.880
If you look at the best universities in the world,

25:54.880 --> 25:56.600
the United States is unique

25:56.600 --> 25:58.880
in having the best universities in the world.

25:58.880 --> 26:02.360
So there are these privileged spots

26:02.360 --> 26:06.400
that are, you know, excellent, uniquely excellent.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.240
So when you look at the comparison,

26:09.240 --> 26:13.720
education in China is improving rapidly

26:14.680 --> 26:19.120
and the quantity is a quantity of educated people

26:19.120 --> 26:23.520
in the areas that they're moving in is greater,

26:23.520 --> 26:27.160
and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.440
And so you see the results are greater,

26:30.480 --> 26:34.400
but it's sort of along the lines that I'm dealing with.

26:34.400 --> 26:39.400
If you were to follow through in terms of actual productions,

26:40.320 --> 26:44.960
I think, you know, in terms of technologies,

26:44.960 --> 26:47.440
there are some areas that the United States

26:47.440 --> 26:49.600
is in a lead at the moment.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.840
There's some areas that China's in a lead,

26:51.840 --> 26:54.920
but China's gaining very quickly.

26:54.920 --> 26:58.120
When I first went to China, 1984,

26:58.120 --> 27:01.080
I would bring $10 calculators,

27:01.080 --> 27:05.000
and I gave them away as gifts to high-ranking people,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.280
and they thought they were miracle devices.

27:07.520 --> 27:12.520
Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing

27:13.280 --> 27:18.280
and AI and, you know, many areas, you have a race going on.

27:20.440 --> 27:24.800
And so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness,

27:24.800 --> 27:26.920
not just look at the current level,

27:26.920 --> 27:29.320
you have a situation where they're improving

27:29.320 --> 27:31.240
at a much faster rate.

27:31.240 --> 27:35.000
This is all good for the world if the world can get along.

27:35.520 --> 27:40.520
And the main thing, I think, is just how do you have

27:43.600 --> 27:45.920
a healthy world, and how do you have a strong economy,

27:45.920 --> 27:49.880
and how do you have a strong situation, is be strong.

27:49.880 --> 27:53.560
The United States' war is with itself.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.320
That's the main war.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.440
You know, it's very simple in history.

27:59.480 --> 28:03.080
Be financially sound, earn more than you spend,

28:04.080 --> 28:08.120
and be strong in these ways,

28:08.120 --> 28:10.760
and pretty much everything will take care of itself.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.160
But you make it sound simple, of course,

28:15.160 --> 28:17.920
because there's a momentum when things degrade,

28:17.920 --> 28:19.640
when the education system degrades,

28:19.640 --> 28:23.080
when you start borrowing, when, I mean,

28:23.080 --> 28:26.120
all of these indicators, once they start going down,

28:26.120 --> 28:28.360
it's, there's a momentum to it, right?

28:28.360 --> 28:30.160
So it's hard to reverse it.

28:30.160 --> 28:33.680
Right, and there are circumstances that you're then in.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.200
For example, indebtedness.

28:37.440 --> 28:42.440
It's politically desirable for those to borrow money

28:43.440 --> 28:47.000
and spend, because their constituencies

28:47.000 --> 28:49.280
only look at what they get.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.960
And when they get a lot, they don't pay attention

28:51.960 --> 28:55.160
to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.640
So it's always better to borrow, spend,

28:58.640 --> 29:01.880
and then leave the cleanup to the next guy.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.800
And so you inherit a lot.

29:04.800 --> 29:09.440
You inherited, as a new president enters in,

29:09.440 --> 29:13.400
or new legislator, they have a lot of debt.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.320
They have a broken down infrastructure.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.800
They don't have enough money to fix that.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.400
And so that's the lay of the land

29:23.400 --> 29:27.640
that the prior generations put you in,

29:27.640 --> 29:29.200
and there you are.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.640
And so that's right.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.920
It's difficult, because when you start to think,

29:33.920 --> 29:35.400
okay, what's healthy?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.960
Well, earn more than you spend.

29:37.960 --> 29:42.040
Well, that's not so easy, because what does that mean?

29:42.040 --> 29:43.480
Go earn more?

29:43.480 --> 29:45.840
I mean, okay, that's not so easy.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.280
Spend less?

29:47.280 --> 29:49.080
That isn't gonna work.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.680
So now what do you do?

29:50.680 --> 29:54.240
Okay, you have this debt that you then monetize,

29:54.240 --> 29:55.720
and that's why it's classic.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.840
So yes, that's why these cycles occur,

29:57.840 --> 30:00.800
because what has created before,

30:00.800 --> 30:03.480
what happened before created the lay of the land

30:03.480 --> 30:06.480
that is then increasingly difficult to deal with.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.760
So what can great leaders do in this moment?

30:08.760 --> 30:13.560
I mean, maybe, my sense is leadership is crucial here.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.240
So for example, to do very large projects

30:16.240 --> 30:18.320
that invest in the education system,

30:18.320 --> 30:22.000
that sort of try to fix the fundamentals,

30:22.000 --> 30:25.960
or maybe invest more and more into the innovation

30:25.960 --> 30:28.560
and the development of new technologies and so on.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.920
It feels like that just doesn't happen organically.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.720
So you have to have strong leaders

30:37.720 --> 30:42.720
that convince the populace of the importance of these ideas.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.680
Well, I completely agree with your list.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.360
What we have is a situation

30:48.360 --> 30:52.280
where everybody has their opinions,

30:52.280 --> 30:54.840
and they have to sort of get them exactly right,

30:54.840 --> 30:56.720
and they all fight with each other

30:56.720 --> 30:58.360
about whether they're opinions.

30:58.360 --> 31:03.360
So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan

31:03.560 --> 31:07.080
so that we don't, and we get over our differences.

31:07.080 --> 31:10.320
I would have a bipartisan cabinet.

31:10.320 --> 31:15.320
I would draw upon members of both parties,

31:15.520 --> 31:19.560
the moderates, who are going to be able to work together.

31:20.480 --> 31:24.360
So as then we have one country,

31:24.360 --> 31:27.840
and then we deal with those in a means

31:27.840 --> 31:30.200
that works for the majority of the people

31:30.200 --> 31:32.480
in the middle rather than the polarity.

31:32.480 --> 31:37.480
I think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that.

31:38.040 --> 31:42.280
So I would say that's a paramount importance

31:42.320 --> 31:44.560
because we have the resources.

31:46.480 --> 31:50.080
Wealth, real wealth and science and everything

31:50.080 --> 31:52.520
has never been better than it is.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.680
But the notion is that it has to work

31:54.680 --> 31:56.800
for the majority of people,

31:56.800 --> 32:00.400
and we have to keep it being productive.

32:00.400 --> 32:05.400
So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably

32:05.400 --> 32:09.840
work together so that they increase the size of the pie,

32:09.840 --> 32:12.680
and they create broad-based prosperity.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.680
So that is a paramount importance.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.920
Whatever they do, if they do it that way,

32:18.920 --> 32:23.320
I can say I'm happy about because that other alternative

32:23.320 --> 32:25.840
is the really scary alternative.

32:30.120 --> 32:33.440
The scary alternative, the different ways

32:33.440 --> 32:35.880
it has evolved throughout history,

32:35.880 --> 32:38.000
some of it has led to wars.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.760
What are the future trajectories

32:41.760 --> 32:44.440
that lead to a potential war with China?

32:44.440 --> 32:46.960
Cold War or hot war?

32:46.960 --> 32:48.280
Is this something you think about?

32:48.280 --> 32:50.280
Is this something you're worried about?

32:50.280 --> 32:52.400
Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.960
So the war with China, as I say,

32:54.960 --> 32:56.880
there are five kinds of wars.

32:56.880 --> 33:01.000
There's a trade war, technology war,

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
geopolitical influence war, capital war and military war.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.920
As far as military war goes,

33:08.920 --> 33:13.920
I think it's only a Taiwan issue, but that's a big issue.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.920
And we could talk about that for a minute.

33:16.920 --> 33:21.200
But those others, they'll be rough competitions

33:21.200 --> 33:25.720
and we'll have that type of evolution over a period of time.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.480
That's what that war looks like.

33:28.480 --> 33:32.200
Taiwan has been for a long time.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.640
A sovereignty issue to China.

33:37.920 --> 33:41.480
And it has its roots in what's called

33:41.480 --> 33:43.520
the 100 years of humiliation.

33:44.520 --> 33:49.520
From the 1840s to 1949, foreign powers came in,

33:49.800 --> 33:52.000
took advantage of China.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.840
They had the Opium Wars and such times.

33:56.280 --> 34:00.160
And that represented the 100 years of humiliation.

34:00.200 --> 34:05.200
And Taiwan represents their sovereignty

34:06.320 --> 34:08.240
and their important thing.

34:08.240 --> 34:11.760
And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,

34:11.760 --> 34:15.600
there was an agreement that there is one China

34:15.600 --> 34:18.680
and Taiwan is part of China.

34:18.680 --> 34:23.680
And that there would be peaceful reunification.

34:24.320 --> 34:29.320
The peaceful reunification has been a part of China

34:30.160 --> 34:31.480
as it happened.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.960
And in their view, that's a very big issue.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.560
And so it's a big contentious issue.

34:37.560 --> 34:41.840
And that could produce a military war,

34:41.840 --> 34:44.440
could produce a military accident,

34:44.440 --> 34:46.040
it's a very tense situation.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.840
And if we had a military war, God help us

34:49.840 --> 34:53.680
because of the capacity in all different new ways

34:53.680 --> 34:56.440
to inflict harm on each other.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.760
But anyway, that's that.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.720
If you don't have that military war,

35:01.720 --> 35:03.440
you'll have the competition

35:03.440 --> 35:06.360
between those other kinds of wars

35:06.360 --> 35:11.360
and whoever is strongest in those areas will win.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.720
Where do you put cyber war within the five?

35:14.720 --> 35:17.440
Well, cyber war is a military war.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.960
I'm assuming the type of cyber war

35:19.960 --> 35:23.680
that you're referring to is that which it's used

35:23.680 --> 35:26.800
to inflict pain on the other party through cyber.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.720
So cyber wars, you'll see cyber war.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.920
You could see space war.

35:31.920 --> 35:36.920
You can see drone warfare, new types of warfare,

35:37.640 --> 35:42.640
not just the traditional and nuclear type of warfare.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.520
But you could see any of the above.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.880
What are the defining characteristics?

35:48.880 --> 35:51.720
What are the interesting things about Xi Jinping,

35:51.720 --> 35:55.960
the president of China as a leader on the world stage?

35:55.960 --> 36:00.960
His father was a early leader.

36:01.720 --> 36:06.720
He was himself in the cultural revolution

36:08.240 --> 36:12.300
and times treated brutally.

36:13.320 --> 36:17.800
And during that period of time, it was very, very difficult.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.480
And he came up through the ranks

36:21.480 --> 36:25.280
and he's a very intelligent man.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.320
When he first came to power,

36:29.320 --> 36:32.160
as you know, they have two five-year terms

36:32.160 --> 36:34.600
and we're now coming to the end

36:34.600 --> 36:36.760
of the second of those five-year terms.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.000
When he first came to power,

36:39.000 --> 36:42.880
he felt that there should be a lot of reform

36:42.880 --> 36:47.600
and reform meant moving to much more of a market

36:47.600 --> 36:49.360
and open economy.

36:49.360 --> 36:53.120
When that happened in him coming in,

36:53.160 --> 36:56.960
I had some contact with economic policy makers,

36:56.960 --> 36:59.320
but in the circumstances then

36:59.320 --> 37:03.840
were that five major banks lent to state-owned enterprises

37:03.840 --> 37:07.800
and local governments with implied government guarantees.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.080
And so there was not control of that

37:10.080 --> 37:14.120
and the movement to aim more of a market economy.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.760
And the development of markets was a primary.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.920
And also the dealing with the corruption issue.

37:20.920 --> 37:24.120
There was a lot of corruption prior to that.

37:24.120 --> 37:28.480
And that was viewed as an existential threat to the system.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.600
So that became the primary objective.

37:31.600 --> 37:36.600
And then as time progressed over those 10 years,

37:36.600 --> 37:40.440
there was a lot of changing

37:40.440 --> 37:43.840
and their financial circumstances

37:43.840 --> 37:46.920
opening many, many other markets.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.460
They particularly getting money

37:48.460 --> 37:51.180
to small and medium-sized enterprises

37:51.180 --> 37:52.940
and developing a lending system

37:52.940 --> 37:55.340
and then establishing controls on it.

37:55.340 --> 38:00.340
So right now there's a vibrant capital markets.

38:04.740 --> 38:07.860
You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,

38:07.860 --> 38:12.300
you can become a billionaire in the capital markets.

38:12.300 --> 38:13.660
And they developed the markets

38:13.660 --> 38:16.380
to be the second largest capital markets.

38:16.380 --> 38:20.300
At the same time, they had to deal

38:20.300 --> 38:23.740
with their rising debt issue,

38:23.740 --> 38:28.700
which they began to deal with really about four years ago

38:28.700 --> 38:33.500
when the second term began.

38:33.500 --> 38:38.500
And then Lou He became the vice-premier

38:41.780 --> 38:46.360
responsible for that and to deal with those issues.

38:46.360 --> 38:49.920
So you see right now that what's happening

38:49.920 --> 38:53.180
is the dealing with the real estate bubble.

38:53.180 --> 38:56.000
There was a development in real estate, a bubble,

38:56.000 --> 39:00.040
which produced a lot of unproductive lending.

39:00.040 --> 39:05.040
And Xi Jinping said houses are meant to live in,

39:06.520 --> 39:08.280
not to speculate on.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.880
And so that was wasteful.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.940
So they established what they call three red lines,

39:12.940 --> 39:14.920
which are financial ratios

39:14.920 --> 39:18.400
that the property developers had to live within.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.880
And that is then causing the adjustments

39:21.880 --> 39:25.280
that are going on now, which in my view are very healthy

39:25.280 --> 39:29.680
because whenever there's bankruptcies and so on,

39:29.680 --> 39:33.160
most in the public think, okay, that's a problem.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.320
It's in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts

39:36.320 --> 39:37.480
and bad practices.

39:37.480 --> 39:40.120
And so that's what's going on.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.640
So that's, let's say economically.

39:42.640 --> 39:47.640
At the same time, there is the changing relationships,

39:48.240 --> 39:50.060
the changing world order,

39:50.060 --> 39:52.840
the changing relationships with the United States

39:52.840 --> 39:54.200
and other countries,

39:54.200 --> 39:58.000
which is becoming much less cooperative

39:58.000 --> 40:01.640
and much more warlike, much more confrontational.

40:02.720 --> 40:07.480
Those two things, the domestic debt problem and domestic,

40:07.480 --> 40:11.200
has led to what's called core,

40:11.200 --> 40:13.200
what they call core leadership,

40:13.200 --> 40:17.200
which means a leadership more around him

40:17.200 --> 40:21.240
that is less challenging

40:21.240 --> 40:23.440
because they believe in history

40:23.440 --> 40:26.360
that during very difficult times,

40:26.360 --> 40:29.880
a more centrally controlled decision-making process

40:29.880 --> 40:31.120
lends itself better

40:31.120 --> 40:35.080
than to a more fragmented political contentious project.

40:35.080 --> 40:38.400
And that's basically what's going on now.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.120
You said it very eloquently,

40:42.120 --> 40:46.640
but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men

40:46.640 --> 40:50.160
and there's a lot of centralized control.

40:50.160 --> 40:53.560
That characterization is view,

40:53.560 --> 40:56.680
is much more black and white than it really is.

40:57.640 --> 41:00.080
But it leans towards that direction.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.320
They're like, for example,

41:01.320 --> 41:03.280
of the standing members of the Politburo,

41:03.280 --> 41:05.200
four are more alleged,

41:05.360 --> 41:09.520
a lot of them, three are less so.

41:09.520 --> 41:10.760
You have to understand

41:10.760 --> 41:14.680
that it's kind of a collective leadership at the top.

41:14.680 --> 41:18.640
And then of course, there's just jockeying for power

41:18.640 --> 41:22.640
in a highly political sense at the top.

41:22.640 --> 41:26.000
But no one leader can be successful

41:26.000 --> 41:30.240
against all those powers at the top.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.920
So it's very politically negotiating.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.600
It's very much more like if you put in the United States,

41:37.600 --> 41:39.520
the Democrats and the Republicans,

41:39.520 --> 41:41.360
and they had to be in the same government

41:41.360 --> 41:43.080
and they work it out.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.160
It's kind of something like that.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.480
And so that's that struggle,

41:47.480 --> 41:49.760
but it's an internal struggle.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.160
Where do you put the importance

41:51.160 --> 41:55.280
of some of these ideas at the founding of the United States

41:55.280 --> 41:57.440
when then, now we're talking about that

41:57.440 --> 42:02.480
at the context of China, the freedom of speech, freedoms.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.640
What China is doing with the central management

42:04.640 --> 42:08.560
of a lot of things, it's enabling a lot of growth,

42:08.560 --> 42:12.920
but it's also limiting people on the very basic level

42:12.920 --> 42:13.960
in terms of freedom.

42:13.960 --> 42:17.320
The kind of freedom that I think can lead

42:17.320 --> 42:19.800
to entrepreneurship, to starting new businesses,

42:19.800 --> 42:22.000
to having big dreams and chasing those dreams

42:22.000 --> 42:24.200
and then creating totally new things

42:24.200 --> 42:26.840
in whatever the space, maybe in technology,

42:26.840 --> 42:29.840
in business and whatever.

42:30.360 --> 42:33.440
How important is that as a metric for society?

42:33.440 --> 42:38.080
Well, they have a view, which is the idea of a dialectic,

42:38.080 --> 42:41.360
which means that two things are at obvious,

42:41.360 --> 42:43.600
that everything comes with pros and cons,

42:43.600 --> 42:46.560
and two opposites exist.

42:46.560 --> 42:50.120
And you want the benefits of those two opposites,

42:50.120 --> 42:51.920
and how do you deal with the benefits

42:51.920 --> 42:54.000
of those two opposites?

42:54.000 --> 42:57.400
So let's say you want the capital markets

42:57.440 --> 43:02.080
because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs

43:02.080 --> 43:04.280
who are motivated, they build fortunes,

43:04.280 --> 43:07.840
and that drives an economy to do very well.

43:07.840 --> 43:12.760
And at the same time, it produces the other problems,

43:12.760 --> 43:14.920
the wealth gaps, the other problems,

43:14.920 --> 43:18.440
then the debt cycle that we're talking about and so on.

43:18.440 --> 43:23.360
And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism

43:23.360 --> 43:27.560
and the market economy and the capital markets?

43:27.560 --> 43:30.120
And he famously said,

43:32.240 --> 43:34.440
doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a black cat,

43:34.440 --> 43:36.360
just as long as it catches mice.

43:36.360 --> 43:40.680
In other words, if it works in making the country richer,

43:40.680 --> 43:42.320
then that becomes the objective

43:42.320 --> 43:43.640
and then they move that along.

43:43.640 --> 43:45.520
So there are these conflicts.

43:46.520 --> 43:51.440
And one of the leaders described it to me as follows,

43:51.440 --> 43:53.200
because it's confusion

43:53.200 --> 43:55.720
and it goes back over a period of time.

43:55.720 --> 44:00.040
There's a hierarchy and it's an extension of the family,

44:00.040 --> 44:01.320
he described it.

44:01.320 --> 44:06.320
And he said, the United States is a country of individuals

44:06.640 --> 44:11.640
and individualism, and that is its vibrancy that we see.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.660
The individual rights to speak up,

44:17.700 --> 44:22.460
the protection of the individual,

44:22.460 --> 44:25.580
individual property rights and all of those things

44:25.580 --> 44:28.300
is of paramount importance.

44:28.300 --> 44:29.940
And we build our organization.

44:29.940 --> 44:32.140
That's why democracy is from the bottom up

44:32.140 --> 44:34.300
or even a company will get together

44:34.300 --> 44:37.540
and we'll be partners to prosper together.

44:37.540 --> 44:39.500
That is the American approach.

44:40.460 --> 44:43.420
He was describing that in China,

44:43.420 --> 44:47.900
it's an extension of the Confucian family, essentially.

44:47.900 --> 44:52.380
And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy.

44:52.380 --> 44:57.060
And so what they think about is the common good,

44:57.060 --> 44:59.420
not the individualism.

44:59.420 --> 45:02.140
So for example, if they want a high-speed rail

45:02.140 --> 45:04.140
to go from one place to another,

45:04.140 --> 45:06.740
and that's best in the common good,

45:06.740 --> 45:08.860
then the individual protections

45:08.860 --> 45:11.340
that would stand in the way of doing that

45:11.340 --> 45:13.700
would be of secondary concern.

45:13.700 --> 45:17.260
So that notion of controlling.

45:17.260 --> 45:22.260
So for example, what they're doing with video games,

45:24.220 --> 45:28.280
they control what type of video games

45:28.280 --> 45:32.780
and how many hours a day kids can be on video games

45:33.940 --> 45:35.700
operating in that way,

45:35.700 --> 45:39.020
because they believe that that's good for the society

45:39.020 --> 45:40.820
and that's very controlling.

45:40.820 --> 45:42.260
In the United States,

45:42.260 --> 45:45.140
I think probably most parents would say, leave it to me.

45:45.140 --> 45:48.380
And it's a matter between me and my kids.

45:48.380 --> 45:50.700
The same thing has to do with data.

45:50.700 --> 45:54.340
In other words, in the United States, who controls the data?

45:55.260 --> 45:57.380
Does the company control the data?

45:57.380 --> 46:00.060
Do you individually control the data?

46:00.060 --> 46:03.620
And so the inclination would be to figure that out,

46:03.620 --> 46:05.700
but nobody would say that the government

46:05.700 --> 46:07.500
is going to control the data

46:07.500 --> 46:11.820
because of our inclination of really anti-government control.

46:11.820 --> 46:14.220
In China, it would be that the government

46:14.220 --> 46:15.900
will control the data

46:15.900 --> 46:18.940
because that's going to be best for the society.

46:18.940 --> 46:21.620
And it depends who you trust, but that's...

46:21.620 --> 46:24.740
So that difference in philosophy

46:24.740 --> 46:28.700
is very much at the heart of that.

46:28.700 --> 46:33.140
As far as your question in terms of effectiveness,

46:33.140 --> 46:35.980
it really is, in China's case,

46:35.980 --> 46:38.180
it's how you balance the things, right?

46:38.180 --> 46:40.060
So what they're attempting to do

46:40.060 --> 46:43.700
is to create a lot of freedom and creativity

46:44.700 --> 46:48.540
in areas that are not political, let's say.

46:50.300 --> 46:53.900
And so you see a lot of entrepreneurship,

46:53.900 --> 46:55.980
you see a lot of product development,

46:55.980 --> 47:00.660
you see a lot of creativity happening in that way.

47:00.660 --> 47:04.940
So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening

47:05.300 --> 47:06.740
is an old stereotype,

47:06.740 --> 47:09.460
whereas a lot of creativity is certainly happening.

47:09.460 --> 47:10.940
And the system can work well

47:10.940 --> 47:13.300
if they can achieve that kind of balance.

47:13.300 --> 47:15.100
It's proven to have worked well.

47:15.100 --> 47:18.340
Since I started going there in 1984,

47:18.340 --> 47:21.140
per capita income, real per capita income

47:21.140 --> 47:24.180
has increased by 26 times.

47:24.180 --> 47:28.980
The longevity rate has increased by 10 years.

47:28.980 --> 47:33.260
The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1%

47:33.300 --> 47:37.420
in terms of basics like starvation and things.

47:37.420 --> 47:41.740
And if you read history, Plato's Republic,

47:41.740 --> 47:46.420
he talks about the cycles, democracy and autocratic

47:46.420 --> 47:49.260
and the benevolent death spot and all of that,

47:50.180 --> 47:53.380
each has their own vulnerability.

47:53.380 --> 47:55.700
The vulnerability of democracy,

47:55.700 --> 47:58.820
which has been a remarkable, remarkable system,

47:58.820 --> 48:02.060
and I don't have to extol the benefits of it,

48:02.980 --> 48:07.980
but the vulnerability of it has always been

48:07.980 --> 48:12.980
the internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy.

48:13.860 --> 48:18.860
In World War II, four democracies chose to be autocracies

48:22.980 --> 48:25.980
because there was internal disorder

48:25.980 --> 48:27.940
and there was the belief,

48:27.940 --> 48:30.220
will somebody bring about order

48:30.220 --> 48:32.660
and get control of the situation?

48:32.660 --> 48:37.660
That was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.

48:38.060 --> 48:41.180
They were parliamentary systems

48:41.180 --> 48:43.860
that turned themselves over to that.

48:43.860 --> 48:48.860
So both systems have vulnerabilities.

48:49.460 --> 48:53.300
I think the main thing that we need to think about

48:53.300 --> 48:54.820
is those vulnerabilities.

48:54.820 --> 48:58.340
Democracy is an amazing system

48:58.340 --> 49:03.340
because the adherence to the rules and the system

49:03.500 --> 49:06.700
and the checks and balances is quite amazing

49:06.700 --> 49:10.500
and it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars.

49:12.460 --> 49:15.060
But there has to be the respect of the rules.

49:15.060 --> 49:18.060
And when you see something like

49:18.060 --> 49:22.500
they will not accept elections

49:22.500 --> 49:27.060
or they will not accept rules, history has shown,

49:27.060 --> 49:29.700
when the causes that people are behind

49:29.700 --> 49:32.380
are more important to them than the system,

49:32.380 --> 49:34.460
the system is in jeopardy.

49:34.460 --> 49:38.300
So we have a situation that's very much like that

49:38.300 --> 49:42.540
in terms of let's say the 2024 elections.

49:42.540 --> 49:46.780
I believe that there's a very high chance

49:46.780 --> 49:51.780
that neither side will accept losing, for example.

49:51.860 --> 49:56.300
And so we have that kind of a situation.

49:56.300 --> 50:00.180
So one would hope that one could rise above

50:00.180 --> 50:04.780
the disagreements and rely on the system

50:04.780 --> 50:06.940
for resolving disagreements.

50:06.940 --> 50:11.780
Because if that doesn't happen, then we have our own chaos.

50:13.340 --> 50:16.860
So the kind of the trend that started in 2020,

50:16.860 --> 50:21.700
or I mean, I suppose it's been there, it's been growing.

50:21.700 --> 50:24.300
One representation of this internal disorder

50:24.300 --> 50:27.460
has been the growing trend of being skeptical

50:27.460 --> 50:29.700
about the results of the election.

50:29.700 --> 50:31.700
Well, it started before that.

50:31.700 --> 50:35.140
There was the emergence of population

50:35.140 --> 50:39.180
before President Trump was elected.

50:40.020 --> 50:43.340
He was basically elected as a populist

50:43.340 --> 50:46.860
because there was a large percentage of the population

50:46.860 --> 50:50.700
that felt that the system didn't work for them.

50:50.700 --> 50:52.660
And he tapped into that.

50:52.660 --> 50:56.100
And he was largely elected as a populist leader,

50:56.100 --> 50:59.460
first populist leader in a developed country.

51:00.620 --> 51:04.220
And so populism began that then.

51:04.220 --> 51:08.460
And that was a battle of one group against the other group.

51:08.460 --> 51:12.140
And so since then, it's been like that

51:12.140 --> 51:13.620
and it continued to grow.

51:13.700 --> 51:18.700
You've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy,

51:18.780 --> 51:22.380
that internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy.

51:22.380 --> 51:25.260
What's the vulnerability of a system like China?

51:25.260 --> 51:28.220
Maybe one way to say is put China aside

51:28.220 --> 51:30.700
and look at history, look at Soviet Union.

51:30.700 --> 51:35.700
What's the vulnerability of a communist type system?

51:35.780 --> 51:40.780
Well, I'll call it both communist and communist.

51:40.780 --> 51:45.220
I'll call it both communist and autocratic,

51:46.500 --> 51:48.980
depending on how much autocracy,

51:48.980 --> 51:52.540
is that it lacks flexibility.

51:52.540 --> 51:56.140
It lacks the ability.

51:57.180 --> 51:59.620
But I should deal with them differently.

51:59.620 --> 52:02.220
In other words, there's the economic system.

52:02.220 --> 52:07.220
The economic system threatens motivation and productivity.

52:07.300 --> 52:12.300
So communism or socialism has to be done in a way

52:12.620 --> 52:17.060
where you can threaten productivity.

52:17.060 --> 52:20.540
Capitalism has, and what I mean by that,

52:20.540 --> 52:24.740
I mean free markets and capital markets

52:24.740 --> 52:28.500
have been an effective way of allocating resources

52:28.500 --> 52:33.500
and also creating the incentives and the resources,

52:33.580 --> 52:37.580
providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas.

52:37.580 --> 52:42.460
And so if I compare that, what the Chinese have done

52:42.460 --> 52:47.180
to a large extent is to recognize that and have made a move.

52:47.180 --> 52:52.100
That's why the seeming dialectic or the conflict

52:52.100 --> 52:53.700
between those two things exists.

52:53.700 --> 52:55.540
But anyway, that's it.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.820
As far as an autocratic system,

52:58.780 --> 53:03.780
rather than one man, one vote from the population up,

53:04.260 --> 53:07.300
the risks of the autocratic system

53:07.300 --> 53:11.260
is that there's enough discontent that arises

53:12.220 --> 53:16.580
that the system doesn't have the flexibility

53:16.580 --> 53:20.540
and that rather than bending, it breaks.

53:21.460 --> 53:24.140
That's the big risk.

53:24.180 --> 53:28.260
The notion of trying to control a population

53:28.260 --> 53:31.460
if there's that rather than giving it the flexibility.

53:32.420 --> 53:36.220
So that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.

53:36.220 --> 53:37.220
What's the human,

53:38.780 --> 53:40.420
because you mentioned like the top gets bigger

53:40.420 --> 53:44.820
with empires and you start to get things for granted.

53:45.780 --> 53:48.380
Is some of this just human nature?

53:48.380 --> 53:53.380
So the concern with China, with autocratic nations,

53:53.500 --> 53:58.500
the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union,

53:59.980 --> 54:03.620
was that fundamentally at the individual level,

54:03.620 --> 54:06.500
the humans involved at the top,

54:06.500 --> 54:09.620
they start becoming, they're starting to lose touch

54:09.620 --> 54:13.500
with the reality in a way that no longer makes them.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.940
I guess that's the representation,

54:14.940 --> 54:17.020
the flexibility that you're referring to.

54:17.020 --> 54:21.220
Well, I mean, in a democracy, you could change.

54:21.220 --> 54:23.620
You can go as far left or as far right.

54:23.620 --> 54:25.820
You can change the leaders easily.

54:25.820 --> 54:27.740
And so the people don't become,

54:28.940 --> 54:31.340
they pretty much only have themselves to blame.

54:32.900 --> 54:35.700
And one of the problems of that

54:35.700 --> 54:38.020
is they may not choose the best leaders,

54:39.340 --> 54:42.380
but they have that flexibility.

54:42.380 --> 54:46.220
So vote and you get what you wanted.

54:46.220 --> 54:49.060
In the case of the autocratic, let's say leaders,

54:49.060 --> 54:53.060
and then the movement from democracies to autocracies,

54:54.060 --> 54:57.420
what you see normally that movement

54:57.420 --> 55:00.540
is that one of the systems is not working.

55:00.540 --> 55:02.940
Let's say the democracy is not effectively,

55:02.940 --> 55:04.500
everybody's arguing with each other

55:04.500 --> 55:05.900
and nobody's getting anything done.

55:05.900 --> 55:10.340
And like Mussolini, the trains are not running on time.

55:10.340 --> 55:12.260
And that would be the example,

55:12.260 --> 55:14.540
geez, this place has gotten chaotic.

55:14.540 --> 55:16.700
Will somebody get into control?

55:16.740 --> 55:20.540
And then you get the autocratic

55:20.540 --> 55:24.780
and then he's autocratic enough to boss people around.

55:24.780 --> 55:29.060
And then you follow those kinds of orders.

55:29.060 --> 55:32.700
And it's like maybe a CEO in a powerful company

55:32.700 --> 55:34.620
going around and that could work well

55:34.620 --> 55:36.380
or it could work badly.

55:36.380 --> 55:41.380
Most companies are run as like autocracies in a sense.

55:42.220 --> 55:45.220
There's the hierarchy and the command economy

55:45.220 --> 55:46.940
and that kind of thing.

55:47.820 --> 55:51.420
And that can work well or not.

55:51.420 --> 55:56.420
But then quite often when you get the populist autocratic,

55:56.900 --> 56:00.420
their personality is something that they wanna fight

56:01.420 --> 56:04.020
and they become more nationalistic

56:05.220 --> 56:07.980
and they tend to become more militaristic.

56:08.020 --> 56:13.020
And human nature at that stage lends itself to fighting.

56:13.100 --> 56:18.100
There's an arc here that when we think of a country

56:18.700 --> 56:22.180
and we say we, when we think of a country,

56:22.180 --> 56:24.700
it's not true, it's not like that.

56:24.700 --> 56:27.060
There are individuals who change.

56:27.060 --> 56:31.060
One generation dies and another generation comes along.

56:31.060 --> 56:36.060
And one of those arcs is that the ones who are fighting

56:37.060 --> 56:41.660
the ones who have been through war don't wanna go to war

56:41.660 --> 56:45.860
and are more happily willing to abide

56:45.860 --> 56:47.980
by whatever the rules are.

56:47.980 --> 56:50.940
As you get farther along into that cycle

56:50.940 --> 56:53.940
and you get a new generation and they forget about wars

56:53.940 --> 56:58.940
and the horrors of wars, then they want to fight.

56:59.580 --> 57:02.820
And so you're seeing right now the emergent

57:02.820 --> 57:06.420
of fight for right and what that means

57:06.420 --> 57:10.700
is you see it internally, fight, where are you

57:10.700 --> 57:14.860
and fight for that thing and they mean fight.

57:14.860 --> 57:19.340
And then externally, fight, are you going to be

57:19.340 --> 57:21.700
the strong one who will fight and win?

57:21.700 --> 57:26.060
And that develops on both sides, this fight and win

57:26.060 --> 57:30.300
and each side is cheering each other on into a war.

57:30.300 --> 57:34.700
But that comes by those who really have not experienced war

57:34.700 --> 57:37.580
because it comes in their part of their lifetime.

57:38.740 --> 57:40.660
Humans are fascinating.

57:40.660 --> 57:41.980
Humans are fascinating.

57:41.980 --> 57:45.700
And by the way, human nature has not changed

57:45.700 --> 57:48.260
over the thousands of years.

57:48.260 --> 57:51.980
So it's so interesting because like in doing this study

57:51.980 --> 57:54.060
and it comes across in the study,

57:54.060 --> 57:56.740
it's like watching the same movie over and over again.

57:57.420 --> 58:02.420
You see the arc and you see it happen over and over again.

58:02.580 --> 58:05.300
The only things that seem to change are the clothes

58:05.300 --> 58:07.500
people wear and the technologies they use.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.060
Yeah, and then somebody probably will disagree with you

58:13.060 --> 58:15.020
about the clothes, maybe there's also cycles

58:15.020 --> 58:17.940
within fashions, maybe we're not even creative there.

58:18.940 --> 58:23.940
What do you make of Russia and Vladimir Putin?

58:24.460 --> 58:26.420
What do you think about Putin as a leader,

58:26.420 --> 58:30.460
as a human being on this world stage within the context

58:30.460 --> 58:33.900
of the cycles of empires that you think about?

58:33.900 --> 58:38.460
Well, Putin came to power at the failure

58:38.460 --> 58:41.220
of Russia's last order.

58:41.220 --> 58:43.500
So there was the end of communism

58:45.260 --> 58:47.980
and there was the development of the market economy,

58:47.980 --> 58:50.140
the collapse of the Soviet Union.

58:51.140 --> 58:56.140
And at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin,

58:58.740 --> 59:03.180
who was an alcoholic and had problems managing

59:03.180 --> 59:05.220
and was put into power.

59:05.220 --> 59:09.900
And the conditions in the Russia were, there was anarchy,

59:10.860 --> 59:13.980
there was no money, it had the classic

59:13.980 --> 59:16.620
end of cycle ingredients, it was broke,

59:16.620 --> 59:18.660
it was people were fighting with each other,

59:18.660 --> 59:23.180
it was in the anarchy and that's when he came to power.

59:23.180 --> 59:27.820
And there were not institutions,

59:27.820 --> 59:29.180
the whole thing had collapsed

59:29.180 --> 59:31.980
and it was not effective ministry of education,

59:31.980 --> 59:33.100
ministry of anything.

59:34.180 --> 59:39.180
And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability

59:41.220 --> 59:43.740
and they needed a democracy

59:43.740 --> 59:47.580
and they needed the improvement of capital markets.

59:48.500 --> 59:53.500
So he's been in that position as I guess I would call him

59:57.420 --> 01:00:02.420
a semi autocratic leader in that from all indications,

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:08.300
he would respect the democracy and he's very popular.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.860
He's won democratic elections

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.620
because he's been a strong leader

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.820
and he's brought peace and stability

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:21.820
to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:27.300
And he's a strong leader in pursuit of the country's interests

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:36.900
in a way where Russia is not a significant economic power

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.340
but it is a significant military power.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.860
So the issues and then there's a strong alliance

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:51.700
between Russia and China now.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.820
So that's kind of the lay of the land

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.380
and then there are sensitivities.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:03.980
The Ukraine issue is a sensitivity

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.980
because there are a lot of Russians who live in the Ukraine

01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.820
and there's also the issue of NATO on their border.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:15.620
So there are those kinds of things

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:17.020
and he has military power

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.700
and he has a strong alliance with China.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.660
And I guess that's my best summary

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:28.660
of what his position is, strong leader, popular.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.380
These are not subjective interpretations.

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.820
These are objective interpretations.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:41.020
Yeah, it's interesting just in this conversation,

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.940
you're not sort of doing the usual criticism

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.460
of any one particular system.

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.740
You're looking at these systems

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:50.660
from the perspective of history.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.980
You're just describing how they work.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:56.460
It's often times when you talk about what Russia is today

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.420
or what the Soviet Union was or what China is today

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.780
is you start to criticize,

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.260
well, they do this kind of censorship

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.540
or they do this kind of,

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.180
they limit freedoms in this kind of way.

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.740
But you're just kind of describing this as a nation

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.300
with ideas what they think is right.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.300
This is how they hope to get it to work.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.540
This is why it's working.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.260
This is what's not working.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.380
Here's metrics that show that it's not working.

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.780
I think that's a refreshing way to think about it.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.220
It's easy though, I mean, you got some criticism

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.100
saying that I think China's a strict parent.

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:35.180
Some people criticize these countries for doing,

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.020
so for violating human rights.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.980
I suppose there's some people that criticize

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.140
the United States for violating human rights.

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:49.220
But what are your thoughts on the world stage today

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.820
about some of the behaviors of this government

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.380
in terms of respecting the rights,

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.420
the basic rights of human beings?

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:02.540
You described accurately how I just tried

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:05.820
to look at things in a non,

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:10.700
I don't want to impute my values on anybody.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.060
I mean, there are intolerable things,

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.820
so I'm not saying there aren't intolerable things.

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:20.380
But one of the great things of being an American here

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.900
is that I grew up with all different nationalities,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.100
having all different points of view

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.740
and all different religions

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.540
and all different ways of operating.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:35.540
And I've come to treasure the fact that that is,

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.020
what's their business is their business.

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:41.220
And then the question is, where do you cross the line

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.020
under what circumstances

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.780
that others have got to do it my way?

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.140
And then when you do it internationally,

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.940
the issue of what is a sovereign state,

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:56.100
which, as I say, in the piece of Westphalia,

01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.060
and you have borders, and then when do you cross the line

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.740
that my way of doing things

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.500
has got to be their way of doing things

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.380
under what are the various rights.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.540
And so that's a very delicate question

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.020
or a very difficult question.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:16.260
And we all have responsibilities to different parties

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.980
and we all have different levels of knowledge

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.260
about those particular things.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.620
So, for example, as an international investor,

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.320
I have a responsibility to my investors.

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.100
Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.580
of how did they run that?

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.580
So if you're taking Nike or Snickers and so on,

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.540
and Americans can decide whether they wanna buy

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:46.260
Chinese products or not buy Chinese products,

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.460
we are all faced with those types of choices.

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.420
So you have, what do you wanna do in your constituency

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.700
and you have your choices.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:56.340
And then beyond that, in many cases,

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:58.100
the issues are quite complex,

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.340
like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:07.340
So, and then I believe that if you disconnected,

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.760
if all those entities like myself, the businesses,

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.860
doing business with China disconnected,

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.460
I think that that would be disastrous,

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.380
economically disastrous.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:27.380
And it would also be reduce the understanding

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.500
that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.780
And so these are all complicated.

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.860
So what we do is, and who makes it,

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:39.660
my opinion matters the most.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.780
Why should it be my opinion that matters the most

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.260
in making that decision?

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.780
So I largely look at the government guidance

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.340
that I get not only from my own government,

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:52.260
but from the other governments, and I follow the rules.

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:55.400
I'm in 40, we invest in 40 countries.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.620
And we wanna do that in the best way

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.100
to provide the diversified portfolio.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:01.820
And we sort of need that.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:06.420
Every one of those countries has similar complexities.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.820
There are always one issue or another,

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.460
and there's only so much that we really understand

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.740
about all of those issues.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:17.060
So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.500
Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.500
to the culture, the place, the way things are done.

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.060
You don't necessarily,

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.820
the way you heal relationships between nations,

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.980
like you said, you work together.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:37.980
And that requires kind of to listen maybe more than you talk.

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.540
And I think people in the public sphere

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.600
talk a lot about China without really listening,

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.980
without understanding much about China.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.420
One of the things that makes me really sad

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.500
because I know how to speak Russian,

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.760
and I know how much is lost in translation.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.280
It makes me sad that I'll never really get to know

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.740
the Chinese culture because,

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.780
like I'll never really get to know the language,

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:08.100
the literature, just talk to regular people.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.660
It's not just the government or officials or scientists,

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.860
just regular folks can get the culture.

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:15.060
I think if you don't understand the culture,

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.740
just the basics of the human nature,

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.860
what people love about their country,

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:25.340
about their family, what kind of hopes they have,

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.540
what kind of values they have.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.660
Without that, you're not gonna be able to

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.060
fully connect with them.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.940
And you have to do that first,

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:37.940
to have a chance of building a good world.

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:39.120
I couldn't agree with you more.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.740
I was very lucky because, as I say,

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:47.860
since 1984, so for more than half of my life,

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:51.060
I've been going there and the common people

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.860
and all sorts of people, and I've got to meet them.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:56.280
I don't speak the language,

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.840
but a combination of through translators

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.980
or them speaking English and being in situations.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:07.460
I had my son go to school, a local school,

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.820
and we developed those kinds of understandings.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:15.820
I think that, but the not wanting

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.860
to know the other perspective

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.080
is the thing that's most scary.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.380
Like I'm right now in the middle,

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:30.700
and all I wanna try to do is to help mutual understanding.

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:34.740
You're right, if there were questions probing me,

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.800
asking me, what is it?

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.460
I'm not on one side or another.

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.900
I don't wanna be on one side or another.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.660
I believe that each has their right within there

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:47.020
to approach their different culture in their own way.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.920
So many ways, you gave an example.

01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:53.660
If they're not doing harm to others.

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:59.780
But that issue of trying to understand

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:03.260
is so much better.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.300
That doesn't mean agree with.

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:11.740
If you are wanting to out clever and out compete somebody,

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:16.780
it still pays to understand what they're thinking.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:20.260
So to achieve understanding of what they're thinking,

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.980
even if you wanna go to war with them,

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:25.060
that understanding is the best thing to have.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.900
What we have now is a situation

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:31.380
in which there's an enemy mentality.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:35.220
And that means that anything that serves,

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:39.540
seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.580
seems to mistakenly create the notion

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:45.380
of I'm on their side in a war.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:47.740
And that's kind of a dangerous thing

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.900
because there's a momentum here to fight.

01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.660
Henry Kissinger praises your new book

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.680
and you thank him in it, in the dedication.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.700
What's your relationship like with him?

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:01.540
What makes him interesting?

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.260
Maybe what makes him controversial?

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:05.780
What makes him such a central figure in history?

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:08.060
First, most importantly,

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:13.060
he's unique about seeing things through all the other's eyes.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:18.060
So if you were, it's like there's a chess game.

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.920
I mean, I think geopolitics is like a chess game,

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.660
but with multiple chess players playing the same game.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:31.660
So imagine there are six people around playing the chess game

01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:34.740
and he could sit in each seat

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.540
and he could know how they see it, okay?

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.340
And see it in a calm way of how they see it.

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.780
He's unique in that way.

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:48.100
He's 98 years old and he's equally able to do that.

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:52.520
And he has a background in which he's a historian.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:57.260
So he really understands history super terrifically.

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:02.100
He doesn't understand economic history as much.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.820
So that's why, to some extent,

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.380
we enjoy having a conversation

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:09.580
because he's interested in the economic piece

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.740
he doesn't know and I'm so interested

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:15.060
in the geopolitical piece that I don't know as well.

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.920
But anyway, he's able to do that,

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.500
but not only a historian, but a practitioner.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:26.500
So when you go from an academic to a practitioner

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:31.860
who has that talent to see things through others' eyes

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:35.220
in an objective way and to be strategic

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.940
rather than just tactical, that's a very special person

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.020
and that's why Henry is, to me, a very special person.

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:45.380
Yeah, he's lived a fascinating life.

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:49.820
Just all of the world events he's been involved in

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.780
is fascinating.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.460
And like you said, that's such an interesting skill to have

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:57.260
to consider what are the concerns, the hope, the dreams,

01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.540
the fears of all the people at the table?

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.240
What are they thinking?

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.640
I find that people don't, once again, don't do that enough

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.680
when it's the obvious thing you should be doing,

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.680
whether it's business deals or political negotiation

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.360
or geopolitical negotiation.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.060
I'm often surprised, again, sorry to go to the Russian thing

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:23.060
because I hear Putin talk in Russian

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.040
and you start to infer certain intentions

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.440
and not the trivial stuff, like the human being.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.000
What is that human being hoping for himself,

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.080
for his country, for his close in a circle,

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.200
for the bigger, and I just see that that's often

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.440
just lost in translation.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.440
I just see American leaders talking to Putin

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.840
and it's just not, there's not a connection.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.000
Absolutely, I know exactly what you're talking about.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.560
It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation

01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.560
or even reading a speech, and you see then it reported,

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.600
inevitably the reporter picks some headline characterization

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.420
that has very little to do with what was really happening

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:19.120
but might be a headline grabber

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.000
that's at some kind of distortion

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.880
and there's a lack of understanding

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.220
of really what's going on.

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:27.600
If it's okay, let me ask you a couple questions

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.860
about cryptocurrency.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.720
You've had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.920
What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today,

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:38.420
its role in the global financial system

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.440
and just in human society in general?

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:44.400
Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:49.400
is one of the things that has influenced changes in my view.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.020
It has proven itself.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.500
Something like 10, 11 years ago,

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.500
imagine the programming of this and here's the,

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.820
you throw it out and that's the idea.

01:14:02.820 --> 01:14:04.860
It has not been hacked.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:09.860
It has operated, it has built, it has come an amazing way

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.700
over that 11 years to be maybe probably the most excited

01:14:18.820 --> 01:14:23.440
topic among a lot of people and has been used

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:28.720
and is now has obtained the status of having imputed value.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.260
At the same time, it is one of those assets

01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:37.480
that is an alternative money.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:42.400
I think we're entering an era where there's going to be

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.400
a competition of monies because of the printing

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.600
of fiat money and the depreciated value.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.400
There will be a competition of monies

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.640
and Bitcoin is part of that competition,

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.880
but there'll be many monies, not just crypto monies,

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.560
but there'll be central bank crypto monies,

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.220
but there'll be different kinds of monies.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:14.720
And even monies are things that you buy and sell.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.760
NFTs can become a money, a type of money.

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.040
You own it and it's an investment and you could say,

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.520
I'd rather own it than own Bitcoin.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:27.240
Has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs?

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.080
Not yet.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:34.960
But only just because I definitely want to buy NFTs

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.200
to just experience them.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.720
I think I should produce one and I should.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.560
I should have asked that.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.840
Have you minted an NFT?

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.760
You probably should just to know what it's like.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:46.640
Yeah, that's right.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.240
This stuff is happening.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:50.320
This stuff is real, okay?

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.960
And how it operates.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.100
But like all new, real things,

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.280
some are gonna go and some are gonna,

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.720
it's like in the internet in the year 2000,

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.340
pets.com could have been a great,

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:08.320
but maybe pets.com doesn't make it and who knows?

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.000
That's the beauty of the competitive system

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.320
that it'll evolve and some things will be treasured

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.440
and some things will be trashed.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.520
So, but when I look at it,

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.440
I think we are in an environment of,

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:23.880
what is an alternative money?

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:27.040
A money has two purposes, a medium of exchange

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.200
and a storehold of wealth.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.760
And we are looking for, and it's portable.

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.060
And it's best if it's recognized in other countries.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.880
So gold is one of those.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.600
So I look at it as an alternative gold,

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.680
but I look at a number of things as an alternative gold.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.640
And I think that, and I think,

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.940
and gold is still my favorite because of certain qualities.

01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:59.840
For example, you can't trace it.

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.400
In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it,

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.120
where it's going and so on.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.480
Governments can have that ability to trace it and so on.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.820
A gold piece of coin, it's not connected.

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.020
I think not connected has benefits,

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.300
particularly in a world where maybe connections

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.700
can be more risky.

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:23.780
So, and then also gold has been for many thousands of years,

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:28.420
universally recognized as a source of money.

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:33.380
And central banks, it's the third largest source of money

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.500
in central bank reserves.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.360
And I don't think Bitcoin is going to serve

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.420
those types of purposes and so on.

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.060
So for various reasons, I prefer gold to the other,

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.940
but it's a little bit part of my mix.

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:50.460
But then you look at it, it hit I think 69,000 this year

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:52.820
is the high Bitcoin hit.

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.660
Do you think it's possible, you mentioned gold,

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.300
do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers,

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.420
like one million that some people talk about?

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.060
I don't think that's possible because the way I look at it

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:11.060
is there's a certain amount of it.

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.060
And there's a certain amount of gold.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.780
I'll use gold as a benchmark.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:26.340
The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion.

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:29.740
Total crypto is about $2.2 trillion.

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:33.740
But let's say Bitcoin, it's $1 trillion.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:38.740
If you take the amount of money that is in gold,

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.340
that is not used for jewelry purposes

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.980
and not used by central banks,

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:48.340
and I assume Bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:50.100
or central bank purposes,

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:55.100
that amount in gold is about $5 trillion.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:59.120
So right now, if you were to have a portfolio

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:03.960
that has gold and crypto, gold and Bitcoin,

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.520
it's worth about 20% of the value of gold.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.520
Do I think it's going to be worth more than gold

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.200
in terms of that mix?

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:16.880
I don't think it'll be worth more than gold.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.320
But let's say it became worth as much as gold.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.680
I don't believe it will be.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.620
I think that 20% sounds kind of about right.

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:27.960
I really don't know what the right answer is.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:32.760
And then there's the question of what is all of that pool

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:36.200
of money that, let's say gold and gold equivalents

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.600
relative to everything else?

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:42.600
Does it go from, let's call it six, seven,

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.760
eight trillion to 16 trillion?

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.120
Maybe it could double.

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:48.740
It depends what it is in the world environment.

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.760
But basically, if you use gold as a measure,

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.240
there's no, it just makes no sense

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.440
that it's going to be used that much more.

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:01.760
Am I sure about that?

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.360
I'm not sure about anything.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.960
But logically, it seems to me that there's a limitation

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:11.320
on its price in relationship to other things

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.300
that are like it.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.880
Let me ask for your deep financial analysis

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.560
on a very important issue.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.400
I've just talked a couple days ago with Elon Musk.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.920
He wants to put a literal Dogecoin on the moon.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.920
What are your thoughts about Dogecoin?

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:31.080
And do you think it'll be the official currency?

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.160
Maybe a reserve currency on the moon and on Mars?

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:37.560
My reaction is, that's cute.

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.360
I remember Elon, when he first got,

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.560
he first got his money from PayPal.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:47.000
I think he said to me, it was, he got $180 million,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.280
$90 million he decided to say,

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.480
why aren't we going to outer space?

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.480
And he wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:03.320
using Russian technology to put a plant

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.780
and a watering can on the moon,

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:13.320
or on Mars, I think it was.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:17.680
And he said, first life on Mars,

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:22.680
or first life on that, as an inspiring notion.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.320
And so then there's always what's behind it.

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.400
I have a lot of respect for Elon's ability

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.280
to do other things behind it.

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:38.080
And so I would take that as symbolic

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.480
and I'd be asking him what's behind it, what's next?

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.840
And I'm also just on the topic of Doishcoin and Memecoin

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.440
and there's some aspect of humor and lightheartedness

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:52.440
that's really interesting about the way we communicate

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:57.440
what ideas become viral, how to captivate people with ideas.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.080
There's something about taking things too seriously

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.880
that somehow slows it all down and it's interesting.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.760
You're right.

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.320
That's part of human nature somehow.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.760
So like humor is part of this whole thing.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.360
You've talked about the importance of writing ideas down.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.700
And you have the fascinating-

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.280
Principles in particular.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.400
Principles.

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.960
And you have this really nice thing in your book

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.600
where you actually, I mean, there's such a brilliant way,

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.000
you have such a brilliant way of highlighting

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.520
which parts are extra important and you make them bold.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.760
That's a brilliant idea.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.400
Let me just ask the high level question

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:41.640
of what's a good system for taking notes?

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.600
Well, I find that almost everything happens

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.840
over and over again.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:52.440
And we're in the blizzard of these things happening.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:56.800
And what I found is that if I'm making a decision

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.200
that after I make the decision usually,

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:06.260
or write at the time, if I pause and reflect

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:08.860
and I write my principle down,

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.340
in other words, principle is sort of a recipe.

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:16.620
What would I use to, how would I make that decision?

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.580
And what are the criteria around it?

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:23.260
I find that I make it much more clear, it becomes clearer,

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.500
and it applies to the next thing that comes along.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.500
It'll be that way because everything happens

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.940
over and over and over again.

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:34.820
And I think people make the mistake of looking at just

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:37.100
the one like it's the first one.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:40.140
I don't know, they have the first problem of this sort

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.180
or the first child or whatever it is.

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:44.740
And this has been happening plenty of times.

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.620
And so if you have the principles,

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:50.700
I found that that helped me think more clearly about it

01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:54.420
and it helped me communicate better, like why?

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:58.940
And so over the years, over the last 30 years or so,

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:00.180
that's what I've done.

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:02.780
I did it originally to communicate very well

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.900
with the people I work with.

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.900
I set up my company and it was very important

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.060
to have good communication.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:11.540
And then we could debate the principles

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:14.060
and so that's the process.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:16.700
I urge people to do that.

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.220
There are many excellent decision makers

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.500
and I just wish that they wrote down their principles

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.340
when this sets.

01:24:25.340 --> 01:24:29.700
So for example, we're talking about Henry Kissinger

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.820
and his new book is gonna come out with a book on leadership

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:37.060
and don't just describe the leaders.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.180
Describe then what about them were the essential elements

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:44.420
to make a good leader under what circumstances.

01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:47.060
And so if we think about that,

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:51.780
then also then you begin to think in a principled way.

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:55.220
And then when you start to think in a principled way,

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:58.820
life becomes, it's so much easier to make decisions

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:01.060
and it's so much less confusing

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:04.180
because it's like coming up on a species

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:08.060
and you say, okay, well, what species is it?

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:10.660
Not just another, it's a thing.

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.380
No, what species is it?

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:15.900
And how do I deal with that species effectively?

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.820
And so that's what that is.

01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:20.340
And so I encourage people to write it down.

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:24.260
I wish anybody who's successful wrote down their principles

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:27.460
or their recipes for making those types of decisions.

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:30.060
So the events of interest here

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.580
happens over and over and over in similar ways.

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.940
And so you're looking for the patterns

01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:36.740
and you're defining the process

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:40.460
that's right to respond to those patterns

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.940
and you call that the principles

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.500
and that allows you to deal with the future effectively.

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.860
So like that codifies the lessons from the past

01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:51.780
to be able to deal with the future.

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.580
What advice do you have for young folks today

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.500
in high school, in college,

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:02.500
thinking about how to have a career they can be proud of

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:05.380
or maybe have a life they can be proud of?

01:26:05.380 --> 01:26:09.380
Know yourself, follow your passion,

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:12.700
make your work and passion the same thing

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.300
while considering the money part

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:18.420
because money will get you freedom and choice

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.500
and be able to make that.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:24.180
But if you know yourself, feel the pull

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:28.580
and pursue that passion.

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.980
And along those lines, by the way,

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.700
I found that using personality profile tests

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.180
has been very helpful.

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:40.540
I've used those for about 25 years

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.900
for people to help to understand themselves

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:43.900
and understand each other.

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:48.900
So I created a free one that is called Principles U.

01:26:49.140 --> 01:26:50.300
It's online.

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:56.180
It's had remarkable, loving people who've taken it,

01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.420
learn about themselves,

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:01.220
but also you can put in somebody else

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:04.100
and it'll tell you about your relationship with them.

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.780
That's like 30 minutes is a quick discovery,

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:10.700
but the main thing is to understand on your journey,

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:15.700
your hero's journey that you will have mistakes

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.260
and you will have weaknesses

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:24.260
and to understand those, not fight those

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.500
because by understanding mistakes,

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.020
you will learn not to make mistakes again.

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:35.340
I have a principle which is pain plus reflection

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:37.260
equals progress.

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:41.180
And so that reflection is important to know yourself,

01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:44.300
know your pulls, know your weaknesses.

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.860
And when you also know your weaknesses

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.860
and the strengths of other people,

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:52.460
there are people who have strengths where you're weak

01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:54.620
and you have strengths where they're weak.

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.260
And to be able to work well together

01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:02.260
is the most effective way of achieving success.

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:06.900
So yeah, it's that journey and there's a life arc

01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:09.780
and there's a journey and you wanna make it the best

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:11.340
that you can make it.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:15.260
And it's like a video game.

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:19.500
It has the challenges and the obstacles

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.900
and the learning experiences and the temptations

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.020
and all of that.

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:28.180
And the maximizing learning to go where you wanna go

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:31.580
to achieve the life you want is the most important.

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.340
That's kind of maybe a long-winded way of saying it,

01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:39.340
but to learn, I think I'll try to say it simply.

01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:41.380
There's a five step process.

01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:46.380
Step one is know your goals, know what you're going after.

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.300
You could have almost anything you want,

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.260
but you can't have everything you want.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:56.100
And so you have to prioritize and you move in that direction.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:57.380
On the way to your goals,

01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.100
you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:05.660
So step two is understanding your problems

01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:07.740
and your obstacles, identify them.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:10.740
Step three is to diagnose them

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:13.900
to get at the root cause of the problem.

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:16.540
And that could be many root causes,

01:29:16.540 --> 01:29:18.460
but it could also be your weaknesses

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:19.700
or weaknesses of others,

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:22.140
but you have to be objective about them.

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:26.060
Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four,

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:29.220
which is to design a way to get around them.

01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:33.940
And then after you have that design,

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:35.740
you implement that design.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.220
So you have to follow through and do it.

01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:42.940
And you do that and that will then produce its new results,

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.780
which should be better results.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.700
I have, I call this kind of the looping process.

01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:50.260
It's the evolutionary looping process.

01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:53.380
And you just keep doing that

01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:55.140
and you learn over a period of time

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:58.500
and you move in the direction that you want.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:01.300
Last question and you only have one minute to answer it.

01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:05.060
You dedicate the book, quote,

01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:08.660
to my grandchildren and those of their generation

01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:12.900
who will be participants in the continuation of the story.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.700
May the force of evolution be with you.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.420
So let me ask, where's this force of evolution

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.460
taking human civilization?

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:24.660
And what in this story that evolution is writing

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:26.500
gives you hope?

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:30.660
Evolution is a direction toward improvement.

01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:36.980
And the greatest force is a man's capacity

01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:40.260
to adapt and invent.

01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:42.940
And so you see in the charts in the book,

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:47.940
you see that this upward movement, life expectancy,

01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:55.220
health, all the things that we think are better.

01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:58.220
You see there's a chart and it shows

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:01.260
that over a period of time and you barely see

01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:06.020
the downturns from depressions and wars in that.

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:08.100
That is the greatest power.

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:13.100
Man's ability to invent and adapt is evolution.

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.420
And that's the greatest power.

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:20.060
And that is what gives me justifiable hope.

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.180
And a continuation of that, like we mentioned with Elon,

01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:25.700
maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species.

01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:28.620
So not only will we keep creating amazing things

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:31.860
here on Earth, we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos.

01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:36.620
My time horizon isn't, doesn't have me analyzing that yet,

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:41.620
but I hope so and I agree that that would be

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.260
the natural choice. So I'm not gonna ask you

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:46.140
for the best financial system on Mars.

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:48.180
I think we'll focus on Earth for now.

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.700
Thank you so much for your brilliance,

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.180
for the books you've written, for the works you've done,

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:54.620
for the inspiration of millions.

01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:57.420
And thank you for spending your valuable time

01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.460
here with me today.

01:31:58.460 --> 01:31:59.980
Thank you.

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.740
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.020
And now let me leave you with some words

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:11.500
from Ray Dalio himself.

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.980
Every time you confront something painful,

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:17.220
you are at a potentially important juncture in your life.

01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:19.340
You have the opportunity to choose healthy

01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:24.340
and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:28.820
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
