00:00.000 --> 00:02.360
The ribosome, who I mentioned a little while back,

00:02.360 --> 00:05.340
can make an elephant one molecule at a time.

00:05.340 --> 00:07.120
Ribosomes are slow.

00:07.120 --> 00:09.240
They run at about one molecule a second,

00:09.240 --> 00:11.440
but ribosomes make ribosomes.

00:11.440 --> 00:14.520
So you have trillions of them and that makes an elephant.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.560
In the same way, these little assembly robots

00:16.560 --> 00:20.200
I'm describing can make giant structures at heart

00:20.200 --> 00:23.160
because the robot can make the robot.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.720
So more recently, two of my students, Amira and Miana,

00:26.720 --> 00:29.160
had a nature communication paper showing

00:29.200 --> 00:33.760
how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making

00:33.760 --> 00:35.520
so the robots can make the robot

00:35.520 --> 00:38.180
so you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.520
The following is a conversation with Neil Gershenfeld,

00:43.520 --> 00:46.720
the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms,

00:46.720 --> 00:49.900
an amazing laboratory that is breaking down boundaries

00:49.900 --> 00:52.560
between the digital and physical worlds,

00:52.560 --> 00:56.880
fabricating objects and machines at all scales of reality,

00:56.880 --> 00:59.880
including robots and automata

00:59.880 --> 01:02.200
that can build copies of themselves

01:02.200 --> 01:06.560
and self-assemble into complex structures.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.360
His work inspires millions across the world

01:09.360 --> 01:13.200
as part of the maker movement to build cool stuff,

01:13.200 --> 01:18.200
to create the very act that makes life so beautiful and fun.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.840
This is Alex Friedman podcast.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.800
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:23.800 --> 01:24.960
in the description.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.520
And now, dear friends, here's Neil Gershenfeld.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.880
You have spent your life working at the boundary

01:31.880 --> 01:36.200
between bits and atoms, so the digital and the physical.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.960
What have you learned about engineering

01:38.960 --> 01:43.240
and about nature of reality from working at this divide,

01:43.240 --> 01:45.040
trying to bridge this divide?

01:45.040 --> 01:48.760
I learned why von Neumann and Turing

01:48.760 --> 01:51.320
made fundamental mistakes.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.000
That's good stuff.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.760
I learned the secret of life.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.160
Yeah.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.080
I learned how to solve many of the world's

02:00.080 --> 02:03.280
most important problems, which all sound presumptuous,

02:03.280 --> 02:05.440
but all of those are things I learned at that boundary.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.680
Okay, so Turing and von Neumann, let's start there.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.800
Some of the most impactful, important humans

02:09.800 --> 02:12.600
who have ever lived in computing, why were they wrong?

02:12.600 --> 02:17.600
So I worked with Andy Gleason, who is Turing's counterpart.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.120
So just for background, if anybody doesn't know,

02:20.120 --> 02:22.080
Turing is credited with the modern architecture

02:22.080 --> 02:25.880
of computing, among many other things.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.320
Andy Gleason was his US counterpart,

02:28.320 --> 02:31.600
and you might not have heard of Andy Gleason,

02:31.600 --> 02:33.880
but you might have heard of the Hilbert problems,

02:33.880 --> 02:36.360
and Andy Gleason solved the fifth one.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.440
So he was a really notable mathematician.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.320
During the war, he was Turing's counterpart.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.920
Then von Neumann is credited

02:42.920 --> 02:45.280
with the modern architecture of computing,

02:45.280 --> 02:47.760
and one of his students was Marvin Minsky.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.080
So I could ask Marvin what Johnny was thinking,

02:50.080 --> 02:52.880
and I could ask Andy what Alan was thinking.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.240
And what came out from that,

02:55.240 --> 02:58.040
what I came to appreciate as background,

02:58.040 --> 02:59.480
I never understood the difference

02:59.480 --> 03:01.880
between computer science and physical science,

03:01.880 --> 03:05.880
but Turing's machine, that's the foundation

03:05.880 --> 03:10.120
of modern computing, has a simple physics mistake,

03:10.120 --> 03:13.000
which is the head is distinct from the tape.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.840
So in the Turing machine, there's a head

03:14.840 --> 03:17.480
that programmatically moves and reads and writes a tape.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.160
The head is distinct from the tape,

03:19.160 --> 03:22.080
which means persistence of information

03:22.080 --> 03:25.120
is separate from interaction with information.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.160
Then von Neumann wrote deeply and beautifully

03:30.160 --> 03:32.680
about many things, but not computing.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.760
He wrote a horrible memo called the first draft

03:36.760 --> 03:38.640
of a report on the EDVAC,

03:38.640 --> 03:41.960
which is how you program a very early computer.

03:41.960 --> 03:46.040
In it, he essentially roughly took Turing's architecture

03:46.040 --> 03:47.600
and built it into a machine.

03:48.680 --> 03:53.560
So the legacy of that is the computer somebody's using

03:53.560 --> 03:55.880
to watch this is spending much of its effort

03:55.880 --> 03:59.600
moving information from storage transistors

03:59.600 --> 04:01.360
to processing transistors,

04:01.360 --> 04:04.040
even though they have the same computational complexity.

04:04.040 --> 04:08.440
So in computer science, when you learn about computing,

04:08.440 --> 04:10.880
there's a ridiculous taxonomy

04:10.880 --> 04:15.120
of about a hundred different models of computation,

04:15.120 --> 04:16.840
but they're all fictions.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.320
In physics, a patch of space occupies space,

04:20.320 --> 04:23.360
it stores state, it takes time to transit,

04:23.360 --> 04:24.720
and you can interact.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.120
That is the only model of computation that's physical.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.240
Everything else is a fiction.

04:30.240 --> 04:34.760
So I really came to appreciate that a few years back

04:34.760 --> 04:36.400
when I did a keynote for the annual meeting

04:36.400 --> 04:38.440
of the supercomputer industry,

04:38.440 --> 04:40.440
and then went into the halls and spent time

04:40.440 --> 04:42.280
with the supercomputer builders

04:42.280 --> 04:45.560
and came to appreciate,

04:45.560 --> 04:48.000
oh, let's see, if you're familiar with the movie,

04:48.000 --> 04:52.120
The Metropolis, people would frolic upstairs in the gardens

04:52.120 --> 04:54.520
and down in the basement, people would move levers.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.080
And that's how computing exists today,

04:58.080 --> 05:00.680
that we pretend software is not physical,

05:00.680 --> 05:02.600
it's separate from hardware.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.000
And the whole canon of computer science

05:05.000 --> 05:08.480
is based on this fiction that bits aren't constrained

05:08.480 --> 05:11.960
by atoms, but all sorts of scaling issues

05:11.960 --> 05:13.720
in computing come from that boundary,

05:13.720 --> 05:16.760
but all sorts of opportunities come from that boundary.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.720
And so you can trace it all the way back

05:18.720 --> 05:22.040
to Turing's machine making this mistake

05:22.040 --> 05:23.320
between the head and the tape.

05:23.320 --> 05:28.160
Von Neumann, he never called it Von Neumann's architecture,

05:28.160 --> 05:30.160
he wrote about it in this dreadful memo,

05:30.160 --> 05:31.080
and then he wrote beautifully

05:31.080 --> 05:32.920
about other things we'll talk about.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.040
Now, to end a long answer,

05:35.040 --> 05:38.120
Turing and Von Neumann both knew this.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.880
So all of the canon of computer scientists credits them

05:41.880 --> 05:45.240
for what was never meant to be a computer architecture,

05:45.240 --> 05:48.240
both Turing and Von Neumann ended their life

05:48.240 --> 05:52.240
studying exactly how software becomes hardware.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.240
So Von Neumann studied self-reproducing automata,

05:55.240 --> 05:58.360
how a machine communicates its own construction.

05:58.360 --> 06:02.280
Turing studied morphogenesis, how genes give rise to form.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.600
They ended their life studying the embodiment

06:04.600 --> 06:07.360
of computation, something that's been forgotten

06:07.360 --> 06:09.080
by the canon of computing,

06:09.080 --> 06:10.840
but developed sort of off to the sides

06:10.840 --> 06:12.880
by a really interesting lineage.

06:12.880 --> 06:16.200
So there's no distinction between the head and the tape,

06:16.200 --> 06:17.880
between the computer and the computation,

06:17.880 --> 06:19.480
it is all computation.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.800
Right, so I never understood the difference

06:22.800 --> 06:25.480
between computer science and physical science,

06:25.480 --> 06:29.040
and working at that boundary helped lead to things

06:29.040 --> 06:31.040
like my lab was part of doing,

06:31.040 --> 06:32.720
with a number of interesting collaborators,

06:32.720 --> 06:36.600
the first faster than classical quantum computations,

06:36.600 --> 06:38.360
we were part of a collaboration

06:38.360 --> 06:40.840
creating the minimal synthetic organism

06:40.840 --> 06:42.680
where you design life in a computer.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.440
Those both involve domains

06:45.440 --> 06:48.320
where you just can't separate hardware from software.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.120
The embodiment of computation is embodied

06:51.120 --> 06:52.800
in these really profound ways.

06:54.160 --> 06:58.400
So the first quantum computations, synthetic life,

06:58.400 --> 07:00.480
so in the space of biology,

07:00.480 --> 07:02.640
the space of physics at the lowest level,

07:02.640 --> 07:05.680
and the space of biology at the lowest level.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.200
So let's talk about CBA, Center of Bits and Atoms.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.320
What's the origin story of this MIT,

07:11.320 --> 07:16.280
legendary MIT center that you're a part of creating?

07:16.280 --> 07:19.760
In high school, I really wanted to go to vocational school

07:19.760 --> 07:24.080
where you learn to weld and fix cars and build houses.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.480
And I was told, no, you're smart,

07:25.480 --> 07:27.160
you have to sit in a room.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.320
And nobody could explain to me

07:28.320 --> 07:31.320
why I couldn't go to vocational school.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.120
I then worked at Bell Labs,

07:35.160 --> 07:39.440
this wonderful place before deregulation, legendary place.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.800
And I would get union grievances

07:41.800 --> 07:43.920
because I would go into the workshop

07:43.920 --> 07:44.880
and try to make something.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.040
And they would say, no, you're smart,

07:46.040 --> 07:48.680
you have to tell somebody what to do.

07:48.680 --> 07:52.160
And it wasn't until MIT, and I'll explain how CBA started,

07:52.160 --> 07:55.560
but I could create CBA, that I came to understand

07:55.560 --> 07:58.080
this is a mistake that dates back to the Renaissance.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.920
So in the Renaissance, the liberal arts emerged.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.440
And liberal doesn't mean politically liberal.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.600
This was the path to liberation, birth of humanism.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.400
And so the liberal arts were the trivium, quadrivium,

08:10.400 --> 08:12.920
roughly language, natural science.

08:12.920 --> 08:17.080
And at that moment, what emerged

08:17.080 --> 08:20.600
was this dreadful concept of the illiberal arts.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.600
So anything that wasn't the liberal arts

08:22.600 --> 08:25.560
was for commercial gain and was just making stuff

08:25.560 --> 08:28.440
and wasn't valid for serious study.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.760
And so that's why we're left with learning to weld

08:31.760 --> 08:34.080
wasn't a subject for serious study.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.320
But the means of expression have changed since the Renaissance.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.880
So micro-machining or embedded coding

08:41.880 --> 08:44.400
is every bit as expressive as painting a painting

08:44.400 --> 08:45.400
or writing a sonnet.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.400
So never understanding this difference

08:49.400 --> 08:52.000
between computer science and physical science.

08:53.480 --> 08:58.080
The path that led me to create CBA with colleagues

08:58.200 --> 09:01.880
was I was what's called a junior fellow at Harvard.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.200
I was visiting MIT through Marvin

09:04.200 --> 09:05.720
because I was interested in the physics

09:05.720 --> 09:07.000
of musical instruments.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.880
This will be another slight digression.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.800
And Cornell, I would study physics

09:13.800 --> 09:15.640
and then I would cross the street

09:15.640 --> 09:17.520
and go to the music department where I played the bassoon

09:17.520 --> 09:19.440
and I would trim reeds and play the reeds.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.840
And they'd be beautiful, but then they'd get soggy.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.320
And then I discovered in the basement

09:23.320 --> 09:25.960
of the music department at Cornell was David Borden,

09:26.920 --> 09:28.000
who you might not have heard of,

09:28.000 --> 09:29.880
but is legendary in electronic music

09:29.880 --> 09:32.120
because he was really the first electronic musician.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.920
So Bob Moog, who invented Moog synthesizers,

09:35.920 --> 09:37.400
was a physics student at Cornell,

09:37.400 --> 09:39.200
like me crossing the street.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.600
And eventually he was kicked out and invented electronic music.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.280
David Borden was the first musician

09:45.280 --> 09:46.760
who created electronic music.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.360
So he's legendary for people like Phil Glass and Steve Reich.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.720
And so that got me thinking about,

09:52.720 --> 09:55.400
I would behave as a scientist in the music department,

09:56.400 --> 09:59.240
in the physics department, but not in the music department.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.680
Got me thinking about what's the computational capacity

10:01.680 --> 10:03.800
of a musical instrument.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.120
And through Marvin, he introduced me to Todd Backover

10:07.120 --> 10:10.120
at the Media Lab, who is just about to start a project

10:10.120 --> 10:14.040
with Yo-Yo Ma that led to a collaboration

10:14.040 --> 10:17.280
to instrument a cello, to extract Yo-Yo's data

10:17.280 --> 10:20.280
and bring it out into computational environments.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.360
What is the computational capacity of a musical instrument?

10:23.360 --> 10:24.680
As we continue on this tangent

10:24.680 --> 10:26.120
and when we shall return to CBA.

10:26.120 --> 10:31.120
Yeah, so one part of that is to understand the computing.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.080
And if you look at like the finest time scale

10:36.080 --> 10:38.520
and length scale you need to model the physics,

10:38.520 --> 10:39.960
it's not heroic.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.880
A good GPU can do teraflops today.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.000
That used to be a national class supercomputer,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.280
now it's just a GPU.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.920
And that's about, if you take the time scales

10:48.920 --> 10:50.680
and length scales relevant for the physics,

10:50.680 --> 10:53.360
that's about the scale of the physics computing.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.480
For Yo-Yo, what was really driving it was

10:56.480 --> 10:59.480
he's completely unsentimental about the Strad.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.200
It's not that it makes some magical wiggles

11:02.200 --> 11:05.960
in the sound wave, it's performance as a controller,

11:05.960 --> 11:09.840
how he can manipulate it as an interface device.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.400
Interface between what and what exactly?

11:11.400 --> 11:12.840
Him and sound.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.880
Okay, him and sound.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.680
So what it led to was,

11:15.680 --> 11:18.040
I had started by thinking about ops per second,

11:18.040 --> 11:23.040
but Yo-Yo's question was really resolution and bandwidth.

11:23.120 --> 11:27.200
It's how fast can you measure what he does

11:27.200 --> 11:32.200
and the bandwidth and the resolution

11:32.880 --> 11:36.160
of detecting his controls

11:36.160 --> 11:38.400
and then mapping them into sounds.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.680
And what we found, what he found was

11:41.680 --> 11:44.080
if you instrument everything he does

11:44.080 --> 11:46.920
and connect it to almost anything,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.560
it sounds like Yo-Yo,

11:48.560 --> 11:51.160
that the magic is in the control,

11:51.160 --> 11:55.720
not in ineffable details in how the wood wiggles.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.560
And so with Yo-Yo and Todd,

11:57.560 --> 11:59.520
that led to a piece and towards the end,

11:59.520 --> 12:01.760
I asked Yo-Yo what it would take for him

12:01.760 --> 12:03.760
to get rid of his Strad and use our stuff.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.400
And his answer was just logistics.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.080
It was at that time,

12:07.080 --> 12:09.080
our stuff was like a rack of electronics

12:09.080 --> 12:12.560
and lots of cables and some grad students to make it work.

12:12.560 --> 12:16.080
Once the technology becomes as invisible as the Strad,

12:16.080 --> 12:19.040
then sure, absolutely he would take it.

12:19.160 --> 12:22.040
And by the way, as a footnote on the footnote,

12:22.040 --> 12:25.120
an accident in the sensing of Yo-Yo's cello

12:25.120 --> 12:27.800
led to a hundred million dollar a year auto safety business

12:27.800 --> 12:29.880
to control airbags and cars.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.240
How did that work?

12:31.240 --> 12:34.000
I had to instrument the bow without interfering with it.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.120
So I set up local electromagnetic fields

12:38.120 --> 12:42.080
where I would detect how those fields

12:42.080 --> 12:45.360
interact with the bow he's playing.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.760
But we had a problem that his hand,

12:47.760 --> 12:49.640
whenever his hand got near the sensing fields,

12:49.640 --> 12:51.040
I would start sensing his hand

12:51.040 --> 12:53.600
rather than the materials on the bow.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.480
And I didn't quite understand what was going on

12:57.480 --> 13:00.160
with that interference.

13:00.160 --> 13:04.920
So my very first grad student ever, Josh Smith,

13:04.920 --> 13:07.440
did a thesis on tomography with electric fields,

13:07.440 --> 13:10.400
how to see in 3D with electric fields.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.360
Then through Todd and at that point,

13:13.360 --> 13:15.720
a research scientist in my lab, Joe Paradiso,

13:15.720 --> 13:18.480
it led to a collaboration with Penn and Teller,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.040
where we did a magic trick in Las Vegas to contact Houdini.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.680
And sort of these fields are sort of like,

13:25.680 --> 13:27.120
contacting spirits.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.480
So we did a magic trick in Las Vegas.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.480
And then the crazy thing that happened after that was,

13:34.480 --> 13:37.800
Phil Ritmuller came running into my lab.

13:37.800 --> 13:42.160
He worked with, this became with Honda and NEC,

13:42.160 --> 13:45.640
airbags were killing infants in rear-facing child seats,

13:46.560 --> 13:49.520
and cars need to distinguish a front-facing adult

13:49.520 --> 13:52.520
where you'd save the life versus a bag of groceries

13:52.520 --> 13:53.880
where you don't need to fire the airbag

13:53.880 --> 13:56.360
versus a rear-facing infant where you would kill it.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.560
And so the seat need to in effect see in 3D

13:59.560 --> 14:01.120
to understand the occupants.

14:01.120 --> 14:05.080
And so we took the Penn and Teller magic trick

14:05.080 --> 14:08.600
derived from Josh's thesis from Yo-Yo's cello

14:08.600 --> 14:10.000
to an auto show.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.120
And all the car companies said,

14:11.120 --> 14:12.800
great, when can we buy it?

14:12.800 --> 14:14.480
And so that became elicis,

14:14.760 --> 14:16.800
it was a hundred million dollar a year business

14:16.800 --> 14:17.720
making sensors.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.080
There wasn't a lot of publicity because it was in the car

14:20.080 --> 14:22.160
so the car didn't kill you.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.480
So they didn't sort of advertise,

14:24.480 --> 14:26.720
we have nice sensors so the car doesn't kill you.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.880
But it became a leading auto safety sensor.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.600
And that started from the cello

14:30.600 --> 14:33.280
and the question of the computational capacity

14:33.280 --> 14:34.720
of the musical instrument.

14:34.720 --> 14:39.320
So now to get back to MIT,

14:39.320 --> 14:42.240
I was spending a lot of outside time at IBM research

14:42.240 --> 14:45.080
that had gods of the foundations of computing.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.240
There's just amazing people there.

14:48.240 --> 14:52.320
And I'd always expected to go to IBM to take over a lab,

14:52.320 --> 14:57.080
but at the last minute pivoted and came to MIT

14:57.080 --> 15:02.080
to take a position in the media lab

15:02.480 --> 15:05.480
and start what became the predecessor to CBA.

15:05.480 --> 15:09.920
Media lab is well known for Nicholas Negroponte.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.440
What's less well known is the role of Jerry Wiesner.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.720
So Jerry was MIT's president

15:15.720 --> 15:20.120
before that Kennedy science advisor grand old man of science.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.760
At the end of his life,

15:21.760 --> 15:25.920
he was frustrated by how knowledge was segregated.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.240
And so he wanted to create a department

15:28.240 --> 15:30.120
of none of the above,

15:30.120 --> 15:33.560
a department for work that didn't fit in departments.

15:33.560 --> 15:37.120
And the media lab in a sense was a cover story

15:37.120 --> 15:38.560
for him to hide a department.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.280
As MIT's president towards the end of his tenure,

15:42.280 --> 15:44.080
if he said, I'm gonna make a department

15:44.080 --> 15:45.600
for things that don't fit in departments,

15:45.600 --> 15:47.640
the departments would have screamed.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.440
But everybody was sort of paying attention

15:49.440 --> 15:50.960
to Nicholas creating the media lab

15:50.960 --> 15:53.680
and Jerry kind of hid in it a department

15:53.680 --> 15:55.240
called media arts and sciences.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.920
It's really the department of none of the above.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.880
And Jerry explaining that and Nicholas then confirming

16:00.880 --> 16:03.800
it is really why I pivoted and went to MIT.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.480
Because my students who helped create quantum computing

16:07.480 --> 16:11.400
or synthetic life get degrees from media arts and sciences,

16:11.400 --> 16:13.520
this department of none of the above.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.560
So that led to coming to MIT with Todd and Joe Paradiso

16:21.160 --> 16:23.000
and Mike Hawley, we started a consortium

16:23.000 --> 16:24.280
called Things That Think.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.280
And this was around the birth of internet of things

16:27.280 --> 16:29.800
and RFID.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.880
But then we started doing things like work we can discuss

16:32.880 --> 16:35.280
that became the beginnings of quantum computing

16:35.280 --> 16:37.320
and cryptography and materials

16:38.040 --> 16:39.880
and logic and microfluidics.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.880
And those needed much more significant infrastructure

16:45.240 --> 16:47.200
and were much longer research arcs.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.560
So with a bigger team of about 20 people,

16:50.560 --> 16:54.120
we wrote a proposal to the NSF to assemble one of every tool

16:54.120 --> 16:57.600
to make anything of any size was roughly the proposal.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.520
One of any tool to make anything of any size.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.520
Yeah, so they're usually nanometers, micrometers,

17:05.520 --> 17:07.800
millimeters, meters are segregated,

17:07.800 --> 17:10.640
input and output is segregated.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.960
We wanted to look just very literally

17:12.960 --> 17:16.920
how digital becomes physical and physical becomes digital.

17:16.920 --> 17:21.600
And fortunately, we got NSF on a good day

17:21.600 --> 17:25.520
and they funded this facility of one of almost every tool

17:25.520 --> 17:27.040
to make anything.

17:27.040 --> 17:32.040
And so with a group of core colleagues

17:32.800 --> 17:36.960
that included Joe Jacobson, Ike Trang, Scott Manalis,

17:36.960 --> 17:38.280
we launched CBA.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.840
And so you're talking about nanoscale, microscale,

17:42.840 --> 17:45.600
nanostructures, microstructures, macrostructures,

17:45.600 --> 17:48.200
electron microscopes and focused ion beam probes

17:48.200 --> 17:52.680
for nanostructures, laser, micromachining and x-ray,

17:52.680 --> 17:55.320
microtomography for microstructures,

17:55.320 --> 17:57.880
multi-axis machining and 3D printing for macrostructures,

17:57.880 --> 17:59.080
just some examples.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.680
What are we talking about in terms of scale?

18:00.680 --> 18:04.040
How can we build tiny things and big things

18:04.040 --> 18:04.880
all in one place?

18:04.880 --> 18:07.680
Yeah, so a well-equipped research lab

18:07.680 --> 18:09.880
has the sort of tools we're talking about,

18:09.880 --> 18:12.280
but they're segregated in different places.

18:12.280 --> 18:16.440
They're typically also run by technicians

18:16.440 --> 18:19.520
where you then have an account and a project and you charge.

18:19.520 --> 18:22.040
All of these tools are essentially

18:22.040 --> 18:23.400
when you don't know what you're doing,

18:23.400 --> 18:25.000
not when you do know what you're doing,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.240
in that they're when you need to work across length scales

18:28.240 --> 18:33.000
where we don't, once projects are running in this facility,

18:33.000 --> 18:36.320
we don't charge for time,

18:36.320 --> 18:38.960
you don't make a formal proposal to schedule

18:38.960 --> 18:40.800
and the users really run the tools

18:40.800 --> 18:42.920
and it's for work that's kind of in co-eight

18:42.920 --> 18:46.520
that needs to span these disciplines and length scales.

18:46.520 --> 18:51.520
And so work in the project today,

18:51.720 --> 18:55.840
work in CBA today ranges from developing

18:55.880 --> 18:59.200
zeptojoule electronics for the lowest power computing

18:59.200 --> 19:03.560
to micro machining diamond to take 10 million RPM bearings

19:03.560 --> 19:06.320
for molecular spectroscopy studies

19:06.320 --> 19:11.320
up to exploring robots to build 100-meter structures in space.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.920
Okay, can we, the three things you just mentioned,

19:15.920 --> 19:17.760
let's start with the biggest.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.360
What are some of the biggest stuff you attempted

19:20.360 --> 19:22.280
to explore how to build in the lab?

19:22.280 --> 19:26.080
Sure, so viewed from one direction,

19:26.080 --> 19:29.920
what we're talking about is a crazy random seeming

19:29.920 --> 19:32.680
of almost unrelated projects.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.360
But if you rotate 90 degrees,

19:34.360 --> 19:37.920
it's really just a core thought over and over again,

19:37.920 --> 19:41.280
just very literally how bits and atoms relate,

19:41.280 --> 19:44.640
how digital and just going from digital to physical

19:44.640 --> 19:45.760
in many different domains,

19:45.760 --> 19:48.720
but it's really just the same idea over and over again.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.760
So to understand the biggest things,

19:51.440 --> 19:56.440
let me go back to bring in now Shannon

19:56.920 --> 19:59.240
as well as von Neumann.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.080
Claude Shannon.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.560
Yeah, so what is digital?

20:04.200 --> 20:08.280
The casual obvious answer is digital in one and zero,

20:08.280 --> 20:09.680
but that's wrong.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.040
There's a much deeper answer,

20:11.040 --> 20:16.040
which is Claude Shannon at MIT

20:16.240 --> 20:18.480
wrote the best master's thesis ever.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.720
In his master's thesis,

20:19.720 --> 20:23.560
he invented our modern notion of digital logic.

20:23.560 --> 20:27.280
Where it came from was Vannevar Bush

20:28.200 --> 20:30.360
was a grand old man at MIT.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.320
He created the post-war research establishment

20:33.320 --> 20:35.480
that led to the National Science Foundation.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.600
And he made an important mistake, which we can talk about,

20:38.600 --> 20:41.840
but he also made the differential analyzer,

20:41.840 --> 20:44.080
which was the last great analog computer.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.160
So it was a room full of gears and pulleys

20:46.160 --> 20:48.960
and the longer it ran, the worse the answer was.

20:48.960 --> 20:52.480
And Shannon worked on it as a student

20:52.480 --> 20:55.040
and he got so annoyed in his master's thesis,

20:55.040 --> 20:57.640
he invented digital logic.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.680
But he then went on to Bell Labs

20:59.680 --> 21:03.040
and what he did there was communication

21:03.040 --> 21:05.160
was beginning to expand.

21:05.160 --> 21:07.480
There was more demand for phone lines.

21:07.480 --> 21:11.760
And so there's a question about how many phone lines,

21:11.760 --> 21:14.560
you could phone messages you could send down a wire.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.920
And you could try to just make it better and better.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.840
He asked a question nobody had asked,

21:19.840 --> 21:21.720
which is rather than make it better and better,

21:21.720 --> 21:23.760
what's the limit to how good it can be?

21:23.760 --> 21:26.840
And he proved a couple things,

21:26.840 --> 21:28.600
but one of the main things he proved

21:28.600 --> 21:32.640
was a threshold theorem for channel capacity.

21:32.640 --> 21:36.480
And so what he showed was my voice to you right now

21:36.480 --> 21:38.440
is coming as a wave through sound

21:38.440 --> 21:40.880
and the further you get, the worse it sounds.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.800
But people watching this are getting it

21:42.800 --> 21:46.160
as packets of data in a network.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.320
When the computer they're watching this

21:50.320 --> 21:52.760
gets the packet of information,

21:53.760 --> 21:56.920
it can detect and correct an error.

21:56.920 --> 22:00.800
And what Shannon showed is if the noise in the cable

22:00.800 --> 22:02.360
to the people watching this

22:02.360 --> 22:04.960
is above a threshold, they're doomed.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.440
But if the noise is below a threshold,

22:07.440 --> 22:10.280
for a linear increase in the energy

22:10.280 --> 22:12.400
representing our conversation,

22:12.400 --> 22:15.480
the error rate goes down exponentially.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.120
Exponentials are fast.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.520
There's very few of them in engineering.

22:19.520 --> 22:22.040
And the exponential reduction of error

22:22.040 --> 22:25.000
below a threshold if you restore state

22:25.000 --> 22:27.200
is called a threshold theorem.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.200
That's what led to digital.

22:29.200 --> 22:32.240
That means unreliable things can work reliably.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.840
So Shannon did that for communication.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.560
Then von Neumann was inspired by that

22:38.560 --> 22:40.760
and applied it to computation.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.040
And he showed how an unreliable computer

22:43.040 --> 22:45.720
can operate reliably by using the same

22:45.720 --> 22:48.080
threshold property of restoring state.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.520
It was then forgotten many years.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.240
We had to rediscover it in effect

22:51.240 --> 22:52.880
in the quantum computing era

22:52.880 --> 22:54.840
when things are very unreliable again.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.560
But now to go back to how does this relate

22:58.560 --> 23:00.520
to the biggest things I've made.

23:00.520 --> 23:05.520
So in fabrication, MIT invented

23:06.360 --> 23:10.080
computer-controlled manufacturing in 1952.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.360
Jet aircraft were just emerging.

23:12.360 --> 23:16.720
There was a limit to turning cranks on a milling machine

23:16.720 --> 23:19.680
to make parts for jet aircraft.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.000
Now, this is a messy story.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.640
MIT actually stole computer-controlled machining

23:23.640 --> 23:25.920
from an inventor who brought it to MIT,

23:25.920 --> 23:28.280
wanted to do a joint project with the Air Force,

23:28.280 --> 23:30.040
and MIT effectively stole it from him.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.400
So it's kind of a messy history.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.040
But that sounds like the birth

23:35.040 --> 23:37.960
of computer-controlled machining, 1952.

23:39.040 --> 23:42.160
There are a number of inventors of 3D printing.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.240
One of the companies spun off from my lab

23:44.240 --> 23:45.920
by Max Lebowski is Form Labs,

23:45.920 --> 23:48.800
which is now a billion-dollar 3D printing company.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.680
That's the modern version.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.240
But all of that's analog,

23:53.240 --> 23:56.120
meaning the information is in the control computer.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.040
There's no information in the materials.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.640
And so it goes back to Vannevar Bush's analog computer.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.480
If you make a mistake in printing or machining,

24:04.480 --> 24:06.920
just the mistake accumulates.

24:06.920 --> 24:11.920
The real birth of computerized digital manufacturing

24:12.120 --> 24:14.080
is four billion years ago.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.960
That's the evolutionary age of the ribosome.

24:16.960 --> 24:21.120
So the way you're manufactured

24:21.120 --> 24:26.120
is there's a code that describes you, the genetic code.

24:26.440 --> 24:30.600
It goes to a micro machine, the ribosome,

24:30.600 --> 24:32.320
which is this molecular factory

24:32.320 --> 24:36.360
that builds the molecules that are you.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.960
The key thing to know about that

24:38.960 --> 24:43.520
is there are about 20 amino acids that get assembled.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.360
And in that machinery,

24:45.360 --> 24:47.880
it does everything Shannon and Von Neumann taught us.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.560
You detect and correct errors.

24:49.560 --> 24:51.520
So if you mix chemicals,

24:51.520 --> 24:54.000
the error rate is about a part in 100.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
When you elongate a protein in the ribosome,

24:57.000 --> 24:59.080
it's about a part in 10 to the four.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.920
When you replicate DNA,

25:00.920 --> 25:03.200
there's an extra level of error correction.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.240
It's a part in 10 to the eight.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.520
And so in the molecules that make you,

25:08.520 --> 25:10.680
you can detect and correct errors

25:10.680 --> 25:12.720
and you don't need a ruler to make you.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.320
The geometry comes from your parts.

25:15.320 --> 25:19.440
So now compare a child playing with Lego

25:19.440 --> 25:21.680
and a state of the art 3D printer

25:21.680 --> 25:23.560
or computerized milling machine.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.160
The tower made by a child

25:27.160 --> 25:29.520
is more accurate than their motor control

25:29.520 --> 25:31.880
because the act of snapping the bricks together

25:31.880 --> 25:33.880
gives you a constraint on the joints.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.480
You can join bricks made out of dissimilar materials.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.120
You don't need a ruler for Lego

25:40.120 --> 25:42.960
because the geometry locally gives you the global parts

25:42.960 --> 25:44.520
and there's no Lego trash.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.560
The parts have enough information to disassemble them.

25:47.560 --> 25:52.200
Those are exactly the properties of a digital code.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.080
The unreliable is made reliable.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.440
Yes, absolutely.

25:55.440 --> 25:59.600
So what the ribosome figured out four billion years ago

25:59.600 --> 26:03.560
is how to embody these digital properties,

26:03.560 --> 26:08.160
but not for communication or computation in effect,

26:08.160 --> 26:09.920
but for construction.

26:09.920 --> 26:13.200
So a number of projects in my lab

26:13.200 --> 26:16.400
have been studying the idea of digital materials.

26:16.400 --> 26:20.360
And think of a digital material just as Lego bricks.

26:20.360 --> 26:24.320
The precise meaning is a discrete set of parts

26:24.320 --> 26:28.320
reversibly joined with global geometry

26:28.320 --> 26:30.560
determined from local constraints.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.360
And so it's digitizing the materials.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.600
And so I'm coming back to

26:34.600 --> 26:36.360
what are the biggest things I've made.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.760
My lab was working with the aerospace industry.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.000
So Spirit Aero was Boeing's factories.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.640
They asked us for how to join composites.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.440
When you make a composite airplane,

26:46.440 --> 26:48.840
you make these giant wing and fuselage parts.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.200
And they asked us for a better way to stick them together

26:52.200 --> 26:54.480
because the joints were a place of failure.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.480
And what we discovered was

26:57.480 --> 26:59.680
instead of making a few big parts,

26:59.680 --> 27:02.880
if you make little loops of carbon fiber

27:02.880 --> 27:06.200
and you reversibly link them in joints

27:06.200 --> 27:09.000
and you do it in a special geometry

27:09.000 --> 27:12.400
that balances being under constrained and over constrained

27:12.400 --> 27:14.760
with just the right degrees of freedom,

27:14.760 --> 27:16.400
we set the world record

27:16.400 --> 27:20.120
for the highest modulus ultra light material

27:20.160 --> 27:24.560
just by in effect making carbon fiber Lego.

27:24.560 --> 27:29.240
So lightweight materials are crucial for energy efficiency.

27:29.240 --> 27:32.280
This let us make that the lightest weight

27:32.280 --> 27:34.000
high modulus material.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.720
We then showed that with just a few part types,

27:37.720 --> 27:39.920
we can tune the material properties

27:39.920 --> 27:43.240
and then you can create really wild robots

27:43.240 --> 27:45.920
that instead of having a tool the size of a jumbo jet

27:45.920 --> 27:47.000
to make a jumbo jet,

27:47.000 --> 27:48.560
you can make little robots

27:48.560 --> 27:50.680
that walk on these cellular structures

27:50.680 --> 27:52.240
to build the structures

27:52.240 --> 27:54.600
where they error correct their position on the structure

27:54.600 --> 27:56.680
and they navigate on the structure.

27:56.680 --> 28:01.680
And so using all of that with NASA,

28:02.040 --> 28:04.560
we made morphing airplanes.

28:04.560 --> 28:08.400
A former student Kenny Chung and Ben Jeanette

28:08.400 --> 28:09.360
made a morphing airplane

28:09.360 --> 28:12.000
the size of NASA Langley's biggest wind tunnel.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.640
With Toyota, we've made super efficiency race cars.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.000
We're right now looking at projects with NASA

28:18.040 --> 28:20.200
to build these for things like space telescopes

28:20.200 --> 28:23.680
and space habitats where the ribosome

28:23.680 --> 28:25.200
who I mentioned a little while back

28:25.200 --> 28:28.160
can make an elephant one molecule at a time.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.960
Ribosomes are slow.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.080
They run at about one molecule a second,

28:32.080 --> 28:34.280
but ribosomes make ribosomes.

28:34.280 --> 28:37.200
So you have thousands of them, trillions of them

28:37.200 --> 28:38.640
and that makes an elephant.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.680
In the same way, these little assembly robots

28:40.680 --> 28:44.600
I'm describing can make giant structures at heart

28:44.600 --> 28:47.520
because the robot can make the robot.

28:47.520 --> 28:51.080
So more recently, two of my students, Amira and Mianna,

28:51.080 --> 28:53.480
had a nature communication paper showing

28:53.480 --> 28:58.040
how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making

28:58.040 --> 28:59.800
so the robots can make the robot

28:59.800 --> 29:02.320
so you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.160
It can self-replicate.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.120
Can you linger on what that robot looks like?

29:05.120 --> 29:08.560
What is a robot that can walk along and do error correction

29:08.560 --> 29:11.880
and what is a robot that can self-replicate

29:13.200 --> 29:14.800
from the materials it is given?

29:14.800 --> 29:15.640
What does that look like?

29:15.640 --> 29:17.000
What are we talking about?

29:17.000 --> 29:17.840
That's fascinating.

29:17.840 --> 29:21.720
Yeah, the answer is different at different length scales.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.600
So to explain that, in biology,

29:24.600 --> 29:28.600
primary structure is the code in the messenger RNA

29:28.600 --> 29:31.280
that says what the ribosome should build.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.880
Secondary structure are geometrical motifs.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.920
They're things like helices or sheets.

29:35.920 --> 29:38.600
Tertiary structures are functional elements

29:38.600 --> 29:41.000
like electron donors or acceptors.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
Quaternary structure is things like molecular motors

29:46.000 --> 29:47.200
that are moving my mouth

29:47.200 --> 29:49.520
or making the synapses work in my brain.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.480
So there's that hierarchy of primary,

29:51.480 --> 29:53.880
secondary, tertiary, quaternary.

29:53.880 --> 29:58.400
Now what's interesting is if you want to buy electronics

29:58.400 --> 30:02.160
today from a vendor, there are hundreds of thousands

30:02.160 --> 30:06.400
of types of resistors or capacitors or transistors.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.760
Huge inventory.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.960
All of biology is just made from this inventory

30:09.960 --> 30:11.680
of 20 parts, the amino acids.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.360
And by composing them, you can create all of life.

30:14.520 --> 30:19.520
And so as part of this digitization of materials,

30:20.680 --> 30:22.840
we're in effect trying to create something

30:22.840 --> 30:24.480
like amino acids for engineering,

30:24.480 --> 30:27.760
creating all of technology from 20 parts.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.280
As another discretion,

30:31.280 --> 30:34.840
I helped start an office for science in Hollywood.

30:34.840 --> 30:38.040
And there was a fun thing for the movie, The Martian,

30:38.040 --> 30:41.120
where I did a program with Bill Nye and a few others

30:41.120 --> 30:43.520
on how to actually build a civilization on Mars

30:43.520 --> 30:45.920
that they described in a way that I like

30:45.920 --> 30:49.000
as I was talking about how to go to Mars without luggage.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.840
And at heart, it's sort of how to create life

30:52.840 --> 30:54.280
in non-living materials.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.720
So if you think about this primary, secondary, tertiary,

30:57.720 --> 31:02.320
quaternary structure, in my lab, we're doing that,

31:02.320 --> 31:04.440
but on different length scales for different purposes.

31:04.440 --> 31:08.640
So we're making micro robots out of like nanobricks

31:08.640 --> 31:11.720
and to make the robots to build

31:11.720 --> 31:14.000
large scale structures in space,

31:14.000 --> 31:16.920
the elements of the robots now are centimeters

31:16.920 --> 31:19.360
rather than micrometers.

31:19.360 --> 31:23.200
And so the assembly robots for the bigger structures are,

31:25.640 --> 31:27.840
there are the cells that make up the structure,

31:27.840 --> 31:29.520
but then we have functional cells.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.400
And so cells that can process and actuate,

31:32.400 --> 31:35.320
each cell can like move one degree of freedom

31:35.320 --> 31:40.320
or attach or detach or process.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.080
Now, those elements I just described,

31:43.080 --> 31:45.280
we can make out of the still smaller parts.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.720
So eventually there's a hierarchy of the little parts

31:47.720 --> 31:51.080
make little robots that make bigger parts of bigger robots

31:51.080 --> 31:52.560
up through that hierarchy.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.400
And that way you can move up the line scale.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.320
Right, early on I tried to go in a straight line

31:57.320 --> 31:58.480
from the bottom to the top,

31:58.480 --> 32:00.400
and that ended up being a bad idea.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.880
Instead, we're kind of doing all of these in parallel,

32:02.880 --> 32:04.760
and then they're growing together.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.320
And so to make the larger scale structures,

32:08.320 --> 32:10.240
like there's a lot of hype right now

32:10.240 --> 32:11.520
about 3D printing houses,

32:11.520 --> 32:13.840
where you have a printer the size of the house.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.760
We're right now working on using swarms

32:15.760 --> 32:19.560
of these table scale robots that walk on the structures

32:19.560 --> 32:22.360
to place the parts much more efficiently.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.720
That's amazing.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.880
But you're saying you can't for now go

32:25.880 --> 32:27.840
from the very small to the very large.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.480
That'll come.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.800
That'll come in stages.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.000
Can we just linger on this idea?

32:33.000 --> 32:36.600
Starting from von Neumann's self-replicating automata

32:36.600 --> 32:39.640
that you mentioned, it's just a beautiful idea.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.600
So that's at the heart of all of this.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.920
In the stack I described,

32:42.920 --> 32:44.840
so one student, Will Langford,

32:44.840 --> 32:47.520
made these micro robots out of little parts

32:47.520 --> 32:50.720
that then we're using for Mianna's bigger robots

32:50.720 --> 32:52.200
up through this hierarchy.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.480
And it's really realizing this idea

32:54.480 --> 32:56.040
of the self-reproducing automata.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.480
So von Neumann, when I complained

32:58.480 --> 33:01.400
about the von Neumann architecture,

33:01.400 --> 33:02.800
it's not fair to von Neumann

33:03.600 --> 33:04.840
because he never claimed it as his architecture.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.320
He really wrote about it in this one fairly dreadful memo

33:07.320 --> 33:09.960
that led to all sorts of lawsuits and fights

33:09.960 --> 33:11.880
about the early days of computing.

33:11.880 --> 33:15.600
He did beautiful work on reliable computation

33:15.600 --> 33:17.080
and on reliable devices.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.480
And towards the end of his life,

33:18.480 --> 33:21.520
what he studied was how,

33:21.520 --> 33:24.080
and I have to say this precisely,

33:24.080 --> 33:27.520
how a computation communicates its own construction.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.000
Yeah, so beautiful.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
So a computation can store a description

33:34.040 --> 33:36.000
of how to build itself.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.680
But now there's a really hard problem,

33:38.680 --> 33:43.520
which is if you have that in your mind,

33:43.520 --> 33:46.600
how do you transfer it

33:46.600 --> 33:50.320
and wake up a thing that then can contain it?

33:50.320 --> 33:51.760
So how do you give birth to a thing

33:51.760 --> 33:53.680
that knows how to make itself?

33:53.680 --> 33:56.360
And so with Stan Ulam,

33:56.360 --> 34:00.280
he invented cellular automata as a way to simulate these.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.960
But that was theoretical.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.920
Now the work I'm describing in my lab

34:05.920 --> 34:08.480
is fundamentally how to realize it,

34:08.480 --> 34:13.160
how to realize self-reproducing automata.

34:13.160 --> 34:16.880
And so this is something von Neumann thought very deeply

34:16.880 --> 34:19.640
and very beautifully about theoretically.

34:19.640 --> 34:22.360
And it's right at this intersection.

34:22.360 --> 34:27.280
It's not communication or computation or fabrication.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.640
It's right at this intersection

34:28.640 --> 34:31.360
where communication and computation meets fabrication.

34:32.280 --> 34:35.280
Now the reason self-reproducing automata

34:35.280 --> 34:36.800
intellectually is so important

34:36.800 --> 34:38.480
because this is the foundation of life.

34:38.480 --> 34:42.080
This is really just understanding the essence of how to life.

34:42.080 --> 34:42.920
And in effect,

34:42.920 --> 34:45.360
we're trying to create life in non-living material.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.360
The reason it's so important technologically

34:48.360 --> 34:50.800
is because that's how you scale capacity.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.520
That's how you can make an elephant from a ribosome

34:53.520 --> 34:56.320
because the assemblers make assemblers.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.320
So simple building blocks

34:58.320 --> 35:01.160
that inside themselves contain the information

35:01.160 --> 35:03.400
how to build more building blocks

35:03.400 --> 35:08.240
and between each other construct arbitrarily complex objects.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.800
Now let me give you the numbers.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.840
So let me relate this to right now

35:11.840 --> 35:15.840
we're living in AI mania explosion time.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.960
Let me relate that to what we're talking about.

35:19.840 --> 35:22.360
A hundred petaflop computer,

35:22.360 --> 35:27.360
which is a current generation supercomputer,

35:27.400 --> 35:29.960
not quite the biggest ones,

35:29.960 --> 35:32.880
does 10 to the 17 ops per second.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.760
Your brain does 10 to the 17 ops per second.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.040
It has about 10 to the 15 synapses

35:38.040 --> 35:40.120
and they run at about a hundred Hertz.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.120
So as of a year or two ago,

35:43.120 --> 35:47.680
the performance of a big computer matched a brain.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.480
So you could view AI as a breakthrough,

35:50.480 --> 35:55.480
but the real story is within about a year or two ago,

35:55.760 --> 35:57.960
and let's see that the supercomputer

35:57.960 --> 36:01.480
has about 10 to the 15 transistors in the processors,

36:01.480 --> 36:03.360
10 to the 15 transistors in the memory,

36:03.360 --> 36:05.200
which is the synapses in your brain.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.760
So the real breakthrough was the computers

36:07.760 --> 36:11.640
match the computational capacity of a brain.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.120
And so we'd be sort of derelict

36:13.120 --> 36:15.520
if they couldn't do about the same thing.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.480
But now the reason I'm mentioning that

36:17.480 --> 36:22.480
is the chip fab making the supercomputer

36:23.320 --> 36:26.440
is placing about 10 to the 10 transistors a second.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.760
While you're digesting your lunch right now,

36:29.760 --> 36:33.800
you're placing about 10 to the 18 parts per second.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.120
There's an eight order of magnitude difference.

36:39.120 --> 36:42.440
So in computational capacity, it's done, we've caught up.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.040
But there's eight orders of magnitude difference

36:45.560 --> 36:47.600
in the rate at which biology can build

36:47.600 --> 36:50.840
versus state of the art manufacturing can build.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.960
And that distinction is what we're talking about.

36:52.960 --> 36:56.280
That distinction is not analog,

36:56.280 --> 36:58.800
but this deep sense of digital fabrication,

36:58.800 --> 37:01.120
of embodying codes in construction.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.880
So a description doesn't describe a thing,

37:02.880 --> 37:04.960
but the description becomes the thing.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.400
So you're saying, I mean, this is one of the cases

37:07.400 --> 37:10.440
you're making that this is this third revolution.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.560
We've seen the Moore's law in communication,

37:12.560 --> 37:15.320
we've seen the Moore's law like type of growth

37:15.320 --> 37:19.400
in computation, and you're anticipating

37:19.400 --> 37:22.160
we're going to see that in digital fabrication.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.200
Can you actually, first of all,

37:23.200 --> 37:26.440
describe what you mean by this term, digital fabrication?

37:26.440 --> 37:29.400
So the casual meaning is the computer controls

37:29.400 --> 37:31.480
the tool to make something.

37:31.480 --> 37:35.600
And that was invented when MIT stole it in 1952.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.560
Yeah.

37:36.560 --> 37:39.600
There's the deep meaning of what the ribosome does

37:39.600 --> 37:44.600
of a digital description doesn't describe a thing,

37:45.640 --> 37:48.080
a digital description becomes the thing.

37:48.080 --> 37:53.000
That's the path to the Star Trek replicator.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.280
And that's the thing that doesn't exist yet.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.520
Now, I think the best way to understand

37:58.520 --> 38:03.400
what this roadmap looks like is to now bring in Fab Labs

38:03.400 --> 38:04.760
and how they relate to all of this.

38:04.760 --> 38:05.960
What are Fab Labs?

38:05.960 --> 38:08.800
So here's a sequence.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.280
With colleagues, I accidentally started a network

38:12.280 --> 38:16.480
of what's now 2,500 digital fabrication community labs

38:16.480 --> 38:19.520
called Fab Labs right now in 125 countries,

38:19.520 --> 38:21.280
and they double every year and a half.

38:21.280 --> 38:24.240
That's called Lass's law after Sherry Lasseter,

38:24.240 --> 38:25.240
who I'll explain.

38:25.240 --> 38:26.520
So here's the sequence.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.080
We started Center for Bits and Atoms

38:31.080 --> 38:33.360
to do the kind of research we're talking about.

38:33.360 --> 38:36.880
We had all of these machines and then had a problem.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.880
It would take a lifetime of classes

38:38.880 --> 38:41.480
to learn to use all the machines.

38:41.480 --> 38:45.560
So with colleagues who helped start CBA,

38:45.560 --> 38:47.360
we began a class modestly called

38:47.360 --> 38:48.880
How to Make Almost Anything.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.160
And there's no big agenda.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.960
It was aimed at a few research students to use the machines.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.000
And we were completely unprepared

38:56.000 --> 38:57.800
for the first time we taught it.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.680
We were swamped by, every year since,

39:00.680 --> 39:02.680
hundreds of students try to take the class.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.560
It's one of the most oversubscribed classes at MIT.

39:06.560 --> 39:07.840
Students would say things like,

39:07.840 --> 39:09.280
can you teach this at MIT?

39:09.280 --> 39:10.480
It seems too useful.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.080
It's just how to work these machines.

39:13.080 --> 39:16.120
And the students in the class,

39:16.120 --> 39:18.880
I would teach them all the skills to use all these tools.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.960
And then they would do projects integrating them.

39:20.960 --> 39:21.800
And they're amazing.

39:21.800 --> 39:25.480
So Kelly was a sculptor, no engineering background.

39:25.480 --> 39:28.280
Her project was, she made a device that saves up screams

39:28.280 --> 39:30.640
when you're mad and plays them back later.

39:30.640 --> 39:31.480
And-

39:31.480 --> 39:33.320
Saves up screams when you're mad

39:33.320 --> 39:34.480
and plays them back later.

39:34.480 --> 39:37.560
You scream into this device and it deadens the sound,

39:37.560 --> 39:39.280
records it, and then when it's convenient,

39:39.280 --> 39:40.920
releases your scream.

39:40.920 --> 39:45.200
Can we just pause on the brilliance of that invention?

39:45.200 --> 39:46.320
Creation?

39:46.320 --> 39:48.160
The art?

39:48.160 --> 39:49.000
I don't know.

39:49.000 --> 39:49.840
The brilliance?

39:49.840 --> 39:50.680
Who is this that created this?

39:50.680 --> 39:51.520
Kelly Dobson.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.360
Kelly Dobson.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.200
Gone on to do a number of interesting things.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.120
Mi Jin, who's gone on to do a number of interesting things,

39:57.120 --> 39:59.840
made a dress instrumented with sensors and spines.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.280
And when somebody creepy comes close,

40:01.280 --> 40:02.880
it would defend your personal space.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.320
They're also very useful.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.920
Another project early on was a web browser for parrots,

40:07.920 --> 40:09.960
which have the cognitive ability of a young child

40:09.960 --> 40:11.680
and lets parrots surf the internet.

40:13.040 --> 40:15.640
Another was an alarm clock you wrestle with

40:15.640 --> 40:17.320
and prove you're awake.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.280
And what connects all of these is,

40:20.280 --> 40:23.360
so MIT made the first real-time computer, the Whirlwind.

40:23.360 --> 40:26.320
That was transistorized as the TX.

40:26.320 --> 40:30.520
The TX was spun off from MIT as the PDP.

40:30.520 --> 40:34.080
PDPs were the mini computers

40:34.080 --> 40:36.400
that created the internet.

40:36.400 --> 40:40.640
So outside MIT was DEC, Prime, Wang, Data, General,

40:40.640 --> 40:42.800
the whole mini computer industry.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.720
The whole computing industry was there,

40:44.720 --> 40:48.720
and it all failed when computing became personal.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.320
Ken Olson, the head of digital,

40:50.320 --> 40:52.840
famously said, you don't need a computer at home.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.080
There's a little background to that,

40:54.080 --> 40:58.640
but DEC completely missed computing became personal.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.640
So I mention all of that because I was asking

41:01.640 --> 41:03.360
how to do digital fabrication,

41:03.400 --> 41:04.680
but not really why.

41:04.680 --> 41:08.400
The students in this how to make class were showing me

41:08.400 --> 41:11.000
that the killer app of digital fabrication

41:11.000 --> 41:12.320
is personal fabrication.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.640
Yeah, how do you jump to the personal fabrication?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.880
So Kelly didn't make the screen body

41:16.880 --> 41:18.160
because it was for a thesis.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.200
She wasn't writing a research paper.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.120
It wasn't a business model.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.440
She wanted, it was because she wanted one.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.160
It was personal expression,

41:27.160 --> 41:29.560
going back to me in vocational school,

41:29.560 --> 41:33.000
is personal expression in these new means of expression.

41:33.520 --> 41:34.880
So that's happened every year since.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.200
It literally is called,

41:36.200 --> 41:37.560
the course is literally called

41:37.560 --> 41:40.680
How to Make Almost Anything,

41:40.680 --> 41:44.440
a legendary course at MIT, every year.

41:44.440 --> 41:48.560
And it's grown to multiple labs at MIT

41:48.560 --> 41:51.120
with as many people involved in teaching as taking it.

41:51.120 --> 41:53.600
And there's even a Harvard lab for the MIT class.

41:53.600 --> 41:58.600
What have you learned about humans colliding

41:58.680 --> 42:01.200
with the fab lab, about the capacity of humans

42:01.200 --> 42:02.480
to be creative and to build?

42:02.960 --> 42:03.960
I mentioned Marvin.

42:03.960 --> 42:06.520
Another mentor at MIT, sadly no longer living,

42:06.520 --> 42:08.120
is Seymour Papert.

42:08.120 --> 42:11.120
So Papert studied with Piaget.

42:11.120 --> 42:14.680
He came to MIT to get access to the early,

42:14.680 --> 42:18.000
Piaget was a pioneer in how kids learn.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.800
Papert came to MIT to get access to the early computers

42:22.800 --> 42:25.320
with the goal of letting kids play with them.

42:25.320 --> 42:27.400
Piaget helped show kids are like scientists.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.320
They learn as scientists

42:29.320 --> 42:31.320
and it gets kind of throttled out of them.

42:31.320 --> 42:32.880
Seymour wanted to let kids

42:32.880 --> 42:34.320
have a broader landscape to play.

42:34.320 --> 42:36.240
Seymour's work led with Mitch Resnick

42:36.240 --> 42:39.440
to Lego, Logo, Mindstorms, all of that stuff.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.000
As fab lab spread,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.560
and we started creating educational programs

42:43.560 --> 42:44.480
for kids in them,

42:44.480 --> 42:46.120
Seymour said something really interesting.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.040
He made a gesture.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.520
He said, it was a thorn in his side

42:50.520 --> 42:53.120
that they invented what's called the turtle,

42:53.120 --> 42:55.680
a early robot kids could program

42:55.680 --> 42:57.960
to connect it to a mainframe computer.

42:57.960 --> 43:01.320
Seymour said, the goal was not for the kids

43:01.320 --> 43:02.520
to program the robot.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.560
It was for the kids to create the robot.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.600
And so in that sense, the fab labs,

43:07.600 --> 43:09.400
which for me were just this accident,

43:09.400 --> 43:11.120
he described as sort of this fulfillment

43:11.120 --> 43:14.480
of the arc of kids learn by experimenting.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.920
It was to give them the tools to create,

43:16.920 --> 43:19.640
not just assemble things and program things,

43:19.640 --> 43:20.960
but actually create.

43:20.960 --> 43:23.200
So coming to your question,

43:23.200 --> 43:26.120
what I've learned is

43:27.080 --> 43:29.400
MIT, a few years back,

43:29.400 --> 43:32.760
somebody added up businesses spun off from MIT,

43:32.760 --> 43:34.480
and it's the world's 10th economy.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.520
It falls between India and Russia.

43:36.520 --> 43:39.720
And I view that in a way as a bad number

43:39.720 --> 43:41.640
because it's only a few thousand people,

43:41.640 --> 43:44.720
and these aren't uniquely the 4,000 brightest people.

43:44.720 --> 43:47.280
It's just a productive environment for them.

43:47.280 --> 43:50.720
And what we found is in rural Indian villages

43:50.720 --> 43:55.120
in African shantytowns and Arctic hamlets,

43:55.120 --> 43:59.800
I find exactly precisely that profile.

43:59.800 --> 44:04.200
So Ling sided a few hours above Tromso,

44:04.200 --> 44:05.840
way above the Arctic circles.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.360
It's so far north the satellite dishes

44:07.360 --> 44:09.440
look at the ground, not the sky.

44:09.440 --> 44:13.280
Hans Christian in the lab was considered a problem

44:13.280 --> 44:14.480
in the local school

44:14.480 --> 44:16.200
because they couldn't teach him anything.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.480
I showed him a few projects.

44:17.480 --> 44:18.360
Next time I came back,

44:18.360 --> 44:21.040
he was designing and building little robot vehicles.

44:21.040 --> 44:25.720
And in South Africa,

44:25.720 --> 44:27.120
I mentioned Sochengovie,

44:27.120 --> 44:28.360
in this apartheid township,

44:28.360 --> 44:30.480
the local technical institute taught kids

44:30.480 --> 44:31.920
how to make bricks and fold sheets.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.800
It was punitive.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.560
But Chapiso in the fab lab

44:35.560 --> 44:37.880
was actually doing all the work of my MIT classes.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.560
And so over and over,

44:39.560 --> 44:43.400
we found precisely the same kind of bright

44:43.400 --> 44:46.680
in van of creativity.

44:47.640 --> 44:52.120
And historically, the answer was,

44:52.120 --> 44:53.080
you're smart, go away.

44:53.080 --> 44:55.440
It's sort of like me in vocational school.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.160
But in this lab network,

44:57.160 --> 44:59.000
what we could then do is in effect,

44:59.000 --> 45:00.360
bring the world to them.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.320
Now let's look at the scaling of all of this.

45:02.320 --> 45:07.320
So there's one earth, a thousand cities,

45:07.320 --> 45:11.800
a million towns, a billion people, a trillion things.

45:11.800 --> 45:14.080
There was one whirlwind computer,

45:14.200 --> 45:17.280
MIT made the first real-time computer.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.840
There were thousands of PDPs.

45:19.840 --> 45:21.800
There were millions of hobbyist computers

45:21.800 --> 45:23.600
that came from that.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.120
Billions of personal computers,

45:25.120 --> 45:27.400
trillions of internet of things.

45:27.400 --> 45:30.160
So now if we look at this fab lab story,

45:30.160 --> 45:32.320
1952 was the NC mill.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.640
There are now thousands of fab labs.

45:35.640 --> 45:39.920
And the fab lab costs exactly the same cost

45:39.920 --> 45:42.480
and complexity of the mini computer.

45:42.480 --> 45:44.320
So on the mini computer,

45:44.320 --> 45:46.200
it didn't fit in your pocket.

45:46.200 --> 45:47.680
It filled the room,

45:47.680 --> 45:51.600
but video games, email, word processing,

45:51.600 --> 45:53.440
really anything you do with the internet,

45:53.440 --> 45:56.720
anything you do with a computer today happened at that era

45:56.720 --> 45:59.320
because it got on the scale of a work group,

45:59.320 --> 46:01.400
not a corporation.

46:01.400 --> 46:05.080
In the same way, fab labs are like the mini computers

46:05.080 --> 46:06.520
inventing how does the world work

46:06.520 --> 46:08.360
if anybody can make anything.

46:08.360 --> 46:11.360
Then if you look at that scaling,

46:11.840 --> 46:16.040
labs today are transitioning from buying a machine

46:16.040 --> 46:18.000
to make machines making machines.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.160
So we're transitioning to,

46:19.160 --> 46:22.320
you can go to a fab lab not to make a project to make,

46:22.320 --> 46:24.320
but to make a new machine.

46:24.320 --> 46:27.280
So we talked about the deep sense of self-replication.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.240
There's a very practical sense of fab lab machines

46:30.240 --> 46:32.480
making fab lab machines.

46:32.480 --> 46:37.480
And so that's the equivalent of the hobbyist computer era,

46:38.320 --> 46:41.440
what it's called the Altair historically.

46:41.440 --> 46:43.640
Then the work we spent a while talking about

46:43.640 --> 46:45.600
about assemblers and self-assemblers,

46:45.600 --> 46:49.680
that's the equivalent of smartphones and internet of things.

46:49.680 --> 46:53.880
That's when, so the assemblers are like the smartphone

46:53.880 --> 46:55.880
where a smartphone today has the capacity

46:55.880 --> 46:58.640
of what used to be a supercomputer in your pocket.

46:58.640 --> 47:02.360
And then the smart thermostat on your wall

47:02.360 --> 47:07.360
has the power of the original PDP computer.

47:07.480 --> 47:08.920
Not metaphorically, but literally.

47:08.920 --> 47:12.040
And now there's trillions of those in the same sense

47:12.040 --> 47:15.680
that when we finally merge materials with the machines

47:15.680 --> 47:16.600
and the self-assembly,

47:16.600 --> 47:19.120
that's like the internet of things stage.

47:19.120 --> 47:21.240
But here's the important lesson.

47:22.120 --> 47:24.840
If you look at the computing analogy,

47:24.840 --> 47:27.960
computing expanded exponentially,

47:27.960 --> 47:32.120
but it really didn't fundamentally change.

47:32.120 --> 47:36.000
The core things happened in that transition

47:36.000 --> 47:37.280
in the mini computer era.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.120
So in the same sense, the research now

47:40.120 --> 47:41.280
we spent a while talking about

47:41.280 --> 47:43.640
is how we get to the replicator.

47:43.640 --> 47:46.560
Today, you can do all of that if you close your eyes

47:46.560 --> 47:49.080
and view the whole fab lab as a machine.

47:49.080 --> 47:51.040
In that room, you can make almost anything,

47:51.040 --> 47:52.720
but you need a lot of inputs.

47:52.720 --> 47:55.600
Bit by bit, the inputs will go down

47:55.600 --> 47:57.360
and the size of the room will go down

47:57.360 --> 47:59.840
as we go through each of these stages.

47:59.840 --> 48:04.640
So how difficult is it to create a self-replicating assembler,

48:04.680 --> 48:09.640
self-replicating machine that builds copies of itself

48:09.640 --> 48:11.640
or builds more complicated version of itself,

48:11.640 --> 48:14.320
which is kind of the dream towards which you're pushing

48:14.320 --> 48:16.840
in that generic arbitrary sense?

48:16.840 --> 48:20.320
I had a student, Nadia Peek with Jonathan Ward,

48:20.320 --> 48:22.840
who for me started this idea of

48:22.840 --> 48:24.480
how do we use the tools in my lab

48:24.480 --> 48:25.720
to make the tools in the lab?

48:25.720 --> 48:26.720
Yes.

48:26.720 --> 48:29.480
In a very clear sense,

48:29.480 --> 48:31.800
they are making self-reproducing machines.

48:31.800 --> 48:34.520
So one of the really cool things that's happened

48:35.280 --> 48:38.000
is there's a whole network of machine builders

48:38.000 --> 48:38.880
around the world.

48:38.880 --> 48:43.080
So there's Daniel now in Germany and Jens in Norway.

48:43.080 --> 48:48.080
And each of these people has learned the skills

48:48.800 --> 48:50.920
to go into a fab lab and make a machine.

48:50.920 --> 48:54.040
And so we've started creating a network of super fab.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.520
So the fab lab can make a machine,

48:55.520 --> 48:57.600
but it can't make a number of the precision parts

48:57.600 --> 48:58.720
of the machine.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.960
So in places like Bhutan or Kerala in the south of India,

49:01.960 --> 49:04.000
we've started creating super fab labs

49:04.000 --> 49:05.880
that have more advanced tools

49:05.880 --> 49:07.840
to make the parts of the machines

49:07.840 --> 49:11.240
so that the machines themselves become even cheaper.

49:11.240 --> 49:15.680
So that is self-reproducing machines,

49:15.680 --> 49:18.240
but you need to feed it things

49:18.240 --> 49:20.640
like bearings or microcontrollers.

49:20.640 --> 49:21.880
They can't make those parts.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.400
But other than that, they're making their own things.

49:24.400 --> 49:26.320
And I should note as a footnote,

49:26.320 --> 49:29.560
the stack I described of computers controlling machines

49:29.560 --> 49:30.800
to machine making machines,

49:30.800 --> 49:32.600
to assemblers to self-assemblers,

49:32.600 --> 49:35.360
we view that as fab one, two, three, four.

49:35.360 --> 49:38.240
So we're transitioning from fab one to fab two,

49:38.240 --> 49:40.600
and the research in the lab is three and four.

49:40.600 --> 49:42.120
At this fab two stage,

49:42.120 --> 49:46.320
a big component of this is sustainability

49:46.320 --> 49:47.920
in the material feedstocks.

49:47.920 --> 49:51.560
So Alicia, colleague in Chile, is leading a great effort

49:51.560 --> 49:54.000
looking at how you take forest products

49:54.000 --> 49:55.680
and coffee grounds and seashells

49:55.680 --> 49:58.640
and a range of locally available materials

49:58.640 --> 50:02.480
and produce the high-tech materials that go into the lab.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.800
So all of that is machine building today.

50:05.800 --> 50:09.680
Then back in the lab,

50:09.680 --> 50:13.040
what we can do today is we have robots

50:13.040 --> 50:14.200
that can build structures

50:14.200 --> 50:17.640
and can assemble more robots that build structures.

50:17.640 --> 50:20.480
We have finer resolution robots

50:20.480 --> 50:23.080
that can build micro-mechanical systems.

50:23.080 --> 50:24.800
So robots that can build robots

50:24.800 --> 50:27.000
that can walk and manipulate.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.680
And we're just now,

50:28.680 --> 50:32.080
we have a project at the layer below that

50:32.600 --> 50:33.920
where there's endless attention today

50:33.920 --> 50:36.520
to billion dollar chip fab investments.

50:37.440 --> 50:41.280
But a really interesting thing we pass through is

50:41.280 --> 50:44.200
today the smallest transistors you can buy

50:44.200 --> 50:45.360
as a single transistor,

50:45.360 --> 50:47.400
just commercially for electronics,

50:47.400 --> 50:49.760
is actually the size of an early transistor

50:49.760 --> 50:51.840
in an integrated circuit.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.720
So we're using these machines,

50:53.720 --> 50:57.320
making machines, making assemblers to place those parts

50:57.320 --> 50:59.360
to not use a billion dollar chip fab

50:59.360 --> 51:00.520
to make integrated circuits,

51:00.520 --> 51:03.160
but actually assemble little electronic components.

51:03.160 --> 51:06.880
So have a fine enough, precise enough actuators

51:06.880 --> 51:10.160
and manipulators that allow you to place these transistors.

51:10.160 --> 51:12.560
Right, that's a research project in my lab

51:13.560 --> 51:16.320
called Dice on Discrete Assembly of Integrated Electronics.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.160
And we're just at the point

51:18.160 --> 51:20.480
to really start to take seriously this notion

51:20.480 --> 51:24.400
of not having a chip fab make integrated electronics,

51:24.400 --> 51:26.840
but having not a 3D printer,

51:26.840 --> 51:30.120
but a thing that's a cross between a pick and place

51:30.120 --> 51:32.240
to make circuit boards in 2D.

51:32.240 --> 51:34.920
The 3D printer extrudes in 3D.

51:34.920 --> 51:37.080
We're making sort of a micro manipulator

51:37.080 --> 51:38.200
that acts like a printer,

51:38.200 --> 51:41.400
but it's placing to build electronics in 3D.

51:41.400 --> 51:43.480
But this micro manipulator is distributed,

51:43.480 --> 51:44.400
so there's a bunch of them,

51:44.400 --> 51:46.280
or is this one centralized thing?

51:46.280 --> 51:47.680
That's why that's a great question.

51:47.680 --> 51:51.320
So I have a prize that's almost but not been claimed

51:51.320 --> 51:54.680
for the students whose thesis can walk out of the printer.

51:54.680 --> 51:55.640
Oh, nice.

51:55.640 --> 51:58.160
So you have to print the thesis

51:58.160 --> 52:01.600
with the means to exit the printer,

52:01.600 --> 52:05.840
and it has to contain its description of the thesis

52:05.840 --> 52:07.200
that says how to do that.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.760
It's a really good,

52:09.760 --> 52:12.200
I mean, it's a fun example

52:12.200 --> 52:13.520
of exactly the thing we're talking about.

52:13.520 --> 52:17.600
And I've had a few students almost get to that.

52:17.600 --> 52:20.920
And so in what I'm describing,

52:20.920 --> 52:23.400
there's this stack where we're getting closer,

52:23.400 --> 52:26.720
but it's still quite a few years to really go from us.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.880
So there's a layer below the transistors

52:28.880 --> 52:30.520
where we assemble the base materials

52:30.520 --> 52:32.240
that become the transistor.

52:32.240 --> 52:35.640
We're now just at the edge of assembling the transistors

52:35.640 --> 52:37.800
to make the circuits.

52:37.800 --> 52:41.680
We can assemble the micro parts to make the micro robots.

52:41.680 --> 52:43.680
We can assemble the bigger robots.

52:43.680 --> 52:44.600
And in the coming years,

52:44.600 --> 52:47.720
we'll be patching together all of those scales.

52:47.720 --> 52:52.640
So do you see a vision of just endless billions of robots

52:52.640 --> 52:53.840
at the different scales,

52:53.840 --> 52:56.840
self-assembling, self-replicating,

52:56.840 --> 52:58.840
and building the more complicated structures?

52:58.840 --> 53:00.480
Yes.

53:00.480 --> 53:03.320
And the but to the yes but is,

53:03.320 --> 53:04.920
let me clarify two things.

53:04.920 --> 53:09.920
One is that immediately raises King Charles' fear

53:10.120 --> 53:15.000
of grey goo, of runaway mutant self-reproducing things.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.280
The reason why there are many things

53:17.280 --> 53:19.040
I can tell you to worry about,

53:19.040 --> 53:21.200
but that's not one of them,

53:21.200 --> 53:25.600
is if you want things to autonomously self-reproduce

53:25.600 --> 53:26.720
and take over the world,

53:26.720 --> 53:29.000
that means they need to compete with nature

53:29.000 --> 53:32.840
on using the resources of nature, of water and sunlight.

53:32.840 --> 53:35.560
And in light of everything I'm describing,

53:35.560 --> 53:37.880
biology knows everything I told you.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.480
Every single thing I explain,

53:39.480 --> 53:41.200
biology already knows how to do.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.400
What I'm describing isn't new for biology,

53:45.400 --> 53:47.840
it's new for non-biological systems.

53:47.840 --> 53:50.440
So in the digital era,

53:50.440 --> 53:53.720
the economic win ended up being centralized,

53:53.720 --> 53:55.600
the big platforms,

53:55.600 --> 53:58.480
in this world of machines that can make machines.

53:58.480 --> 54:03.480
I'm asked, for example, what's the killer opportunity?

54:03.480 --> 54:05.560
Who's gonna make all the money?

54:05.560 --> 54:07.040
Who to invest in?

54:07.040 --> 54:08.920
But if the machine can make the machine,

54:08.920 --> 54:12.120
it's not a great business to invest in the machine.

54:13.480 --> 54:16.520
In the same way that if you can produce,

54:16.520 --> 54:19.680
if you can think globally but produce locally,

54:19.680 --> 54:23.280
then the way the technology goes out into society

54:23.280 --> 54:26.080
isn't a function of central control,

54:26.080 --> 54:27.880
but is fundamentally distributed.

54:27.880 --> 54:31.600
Now, that raises an obvious kind of concern,

54:31.600 --> 54:33.680
which is, well, doesn't this mean you could make bombs

54:33.680 --> 54:35.680
and guns and all of that?

54:35.680 --> 54:38.200
The reason that's much less of a problem

54:38.200 --> 54:41.960
than you would think is making bombs and guns

54:41.960 --> 54:45.240
and all of that is a very well-met market need.

54:45.240 --> 54:49.640
Anywhere we go, there's a fine supply chain for weapons.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.800
You know, hobbyists have been making guns for ages

54:52.800 --> 54:55.320
and guns are available just about anywhere.

54:55.320 --> 54:57.320
So you could go into the lab and make a gun.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.520
Today, it's not a very good gun,

54:59.520 --> 55:01.280
and guns are easily available.

55:01.280 --> 55:04.280
And so generally, we run these lab and war zones.

55:04.280 --> 55:09.280
What we find is people don't go to them to make weapons,

55:09.280 --> 55:10.720
which you can already do anyway,

55:10.720 --> 55:12.640
it's an alternative to making weapons.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.000
Coming back to your question,

55:14.000 --> 55:17.720
I'd say the single most important thing I've learned is

55:17.760 --> 55:18.960
that the central resource of the planet

55:18.960 --> 55:23.040
is this amazing density of bright inventive people

55:23.040 --> 55:24.560
whose brains are underused.

55:24.560 --> 55:29.560
And you could view the social engineering of this lab work

55:30.240 --> 55:32.320
as creating the capacity for them.

55:32.320 --> 55:37.040
And so in the end, the way this is gonna impact society

55:37.040 --> 55:38.840
isn't gonna be command and control,

55:38.840 --> 55:40.920
it's how the world uses it.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.480
And it's been really gratifying for me

55:43.480 --> 55:45.720
to see just how it does.

55:45.880 --> 55:48.080
But what are the different ways

55:48.080 --> 55:50.840
the evolution of the exponential scaling

55:50.840 --> 55:52.680
of digital fabrication can evolve?

55:52.680 --> 55:56.680
So you said, yeah, self-replicating nanobots, right?

55:56.680 --> 55:59.640
This is the gray goo fear.

55:59.640 --> 56:01.720
It's a caricature of a fear,

56:01.720 --> 56:03.640
but nevertheless, there's interesting,

56:03.640 --> 56:06.520
just like you said, spam and all these kinds of things

56:06.520 --> 56:10.000
that came with the scaling of communication and computation.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.840
What are the different ways

56:11.840 --> 56:15.000
that malevolent actors will use this technology?

56:15.240 --> 56:17.600
Well, first, let me start with a benevolent story,

56:17.600 --> 56:22.600
which is trash is an analog concept.

56:23.920 --> 56:25.720
There's no trash in a forest,

56:25.720 --> 56:28.440
all the parts get disassembled and reused.

56:28.440 --> 56:31.480
Trash means something doesn't have enough information

56:31.480 --> 56:33.880
to tell you how to reuse it.

56:33.880 --> 56:38.400
It's as simple as there's no trash in a Lego room.

56:38.400 --> 56:39.680
When you assemble Lego,

56:39.680 --> 56:42.800
the Lego bricks have enough information to disassemble them.

56:42.800 --> 56:44.440
So one of the,

56:44.440 --> 56:47.240
so as you go through this fab1234 story,

56:47.240 --> 56:51.120
one of the implications of this transition

56:51.120 --> 56:53.640
to from printing to assembling.

56:53.640 --> 56:56.200
So the real breakthrough technologically

56:56.200 --> 56:58.200
isn't additive versus subtractive,

56:58.200 --> 57:01.400
which is a subject of a lot of attention and hype.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.000
3D printers are useful.

57:05.200 --> 57:07.880
We spun off companies like Forum Labs

57:07.880 --> 57:09.760
led by Max for 3D printing,

57:09.760 --> 57:12.280
but in a fab lab, it's one of maybe 10 machines.

57:12.520 --> 57:15.040
It's used, but it's only part of the machines.

57:15.040 --> 57:17.000
The real technological change

57:17.000 --> 57:18.440
is when we go from printing and cutting

57:18.440 --> 57:22.080
to assembling and disassembling.

57:22.080 --> 57:26.480
But that reduces inventories of hundreds of thousands

57:26.480 --> 57:28.160
of parts to just having a few parts

57:28.160 --> 57:29.760
to make almost anything.

57:29.760 --> 57:31.760
It reduces global supply chains

57:31.760 --> 57:34.080
to locally sourcing these building blocks.

57:34.080 --> 57:35.720
But one of the key implications

57:35.720 --> 57:39.320
is it gets rid of technological trash

57:39.320 --> 57:41.960
because you can disassemble and reuse the parts,

57:42.600 --> 57:43.440
not throw them away.

57:43.440 --> 57:45.840
And so initially that's of interest for things

57:45.840 --> 57:48.640
at the end of long supply chains, like satellites on orbit.

57:48.640 --> 57:51.640
But one of the things coming is eliminating technical trash

57:51.640 --> 57:54.360
through reuse of the building blocks.

57:54.360 --> 57:56.760
So like when you think about 3D printers,

57:56.760 --> 57:59.880
you're thinking about addition and subtraction.

57:59.880 --> 58:03.600
When you think about the other options available to you

58:03.600 --> 58:05.760
in that parameter space, as you call it,

58:05.760 --> 58:09.440
that's going to be assembly, disassembly, cutting, you said.

58:09.480 --> 58:14.280
So the 1952 NC mill was subtractive.

58:14.280 --> 58:15.600
You remove material.

58:15.600 --> 58:19.040
And 3D printing additive,

58:19.040 --> 58:20.080
and there's a couple of claims

58:20.080 --> 58:21.760
to the invention of 3D printing,

58:21.760 --> 58:23.600
that's closer to what's called net shape,

58:23.600 --> 58:25.400
which is you don't have to cut away the material

58:25.400 --> 58:27.640
you don't need, you just put material where you do need it.

58:27.640 --> 58:30.040
And so that's the 3D printing revolution.

58:30.040 --> 58:34.520
But there are all sorts of limitations on 3D printing

58:34.520 --> 58:38.120
to the kinds of materials you can print,

58:38.160 --> 58:40.360
the kind of functionality you can print.

58:40.360 --> 58:42.680
We're just not going to get to making

58:44.920 --> 58:47.840
everything in a cell phone on a single printer.

58:47.840 --> 58:50.120
But I do expect to make everything in a cell phone

58:50.120 --> 58:51.120
with an assembler.

58:51.120 --> 58:54.320
And so instead of printing and cutting technologically,

58:54.320 --> 58:57.720
it's this transition to assembling and disassembling.

58:57.720 --> 59:00.240
Going back to Shannon and von Neumann,

59:00.240 --> 59:03.440
going back to the ribosome four billion years ago.

59:03.440 --> 59:06.360
Now you come to malevolent.

59:06.400 --> 59:09.000
Let me tell you a story about,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.480
I was doing a briefing

59:11.480 --> 59:15.440
for the National Academy of Sciences group

59:15.440 --> 59:19.000
that advises the intelligence communities.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.760
And I talked about the kind of research we do.

59:21.760 --> 59:22.760
And at the very end,

59:22.760 --> 59:27.520
I showed a little video clip of Valentina in Ghana,

59:27.520 --> 59:32.360
making a local girl making surface mount electronics

59:32.360 --> 59:33.400
in the fab lab.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.320
And I showed that to this room full of people.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.120
One of the members of the intelligence community

59:39.120 --> 59:41.160
got up livid and said,

59:41.160 --> 59:43.440
how dare you waste our time

59:43.440 --> 59:45.600
showing us a young girl in an African village

59:45.600 --> 59:47.520
making surface mount electronics.

59:47.520 --> 59:49.280
We're looking at,

59:49.280 --> 59:51.040
we need to know about disruptive threats

59:51.040 --> 59:52.760
to the future of the United States.

59:53.800 --> 59:56.680
And somebody else got up in the room and yelled at him,

59:56.680 --> 59:57.720
and you idiot,

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.360
I can't think of anything more important than this.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.840
But for two reasons.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.280
One reason was,

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:08.680
because if we rely on informational superiority

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.600
in the battlefield,

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.960
it means other people could get access to it.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.000
But this intelligence person's point, bless him,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:15.960
wasn't that,

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:20.040
it was getting at the root causes of conflict,

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.240
is if this young girl in an African village

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.080
could actually master surface mount electronics,

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.120
it changes some of the most fundamental things

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.920
about recruitment for terrorism,

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.680
impact of economic migration,

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.600
basic assumptions about an economy.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.360
It's just existential for the future of the planet.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.440
But we've just lived through a pandemic.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.120
I would love to linger on this

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.120
because the possibilities that are positive are endless.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.760
But the possibilities and negative

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.040
are still nevertheless extremely important.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.200
It's both positive and negative.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:01.200
What do you do with a large number of general assemblers?

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.920
With the fab lab, you could roughly make a bio lab,

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.520
then learn biotechnology.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.920
Now that's terrifying

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.040
because making self-reproducing gray goo

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.280
that outcompetes biology,

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.520
I consider doomed because biology knows everything

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.960
I'm describing and is really good at what it does.

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.880
How to grow almost anything,

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.960
you learn skills in biotechnology

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:32.760
that let you make serious biological threats.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:36.520
And when you combine some of the innovations

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.080
you see with large language models,

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.680
some of the innovations you see with Alpha Fold,

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.880
so applications of AI for designing biological systems

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:47.920
for writing programs,

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.240
which you can large language models increasingly.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.040
So there seems to be an interesting dance here

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.120
of automating the design stage

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.920
of complex systems using AI.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.400
And then that's the bits.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.560
And you can leap,

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.160
now the innovations you're talking about,

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.520
you can leap from the complex systems in the digital space

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.040
to the printing, to the creation, to the assembly

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:18.040
at scale of complex systems in the physical space.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.480
Yeah, so something to be scared about

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.320
is a fab lab can make a bio lab,

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.480
a bio lab can make biotechnology,

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.960
somebody could learn to make a virus.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.920
That's scary.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.840
Unlike some of the things I said, I don't worry about,

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.080
that's something I really worry about that is scary.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.960
Now, how do you deal with that?

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.560
Prior threats, we dealt with command and control.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.960
So like early color copiers had unique codes

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.600
and you could tell which copier made them.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.400
Eventually you couldn't keep up with that.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.480
There was a famous meeting at Isilomar

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.560
in the early days of recombinant DNA

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.480
where that community recognized the dangers

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:09.800
of what it was doing and put in place a regime

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.240
to help manage it.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.520
And so that led to the kind of research management.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.080
So MIT has an office that supervises research

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.840
and it works with the national office.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.480
That works if you can identify who's doing it and where.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.360
It doesn't work in this world we're describing.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.840
So anybody could do this anywhere.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.840
And so what we found is you can't contain this,

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.000
it's already out, you can't forbid

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.240
because there isn't command and control.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.520
The most useful thing you can do

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.240
is provide incentives for transparency.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.880
But really the heart of what we do is you could do this

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.880
by yourself in a basement for nefarious reasons

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.120
or you could come into a place in the light

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.880
where you get help and you get community

01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.600
and you get resources.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.520
And there's an incentive to do it in the open,

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.480
not in the dark.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.280
And that might sound naive,

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:10.240
but in the sort of places we're working,

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:16.480
again, bad people do bad things in these places already,

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.800
but providing openness and providing transparency

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.480
is a key part of managing these.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.280
And so it transitions from regulating risks as regulation

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.120
to soft power to manage them.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.040
So there's so much potential for good,

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.360
so much capacity for good that fab labs

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.360
and the ability and the tools of creation

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.800
really unlock that potential.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.640
Yeah, and I don't say that as sort of dewy-eyed naive.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.600
I say that empirically from just years

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.240
of seeing how this plays out in communities.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.800
I wonder if it's the early days of personal computers though

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.880
before we get spam, right?

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.120
In the end, most fundamentally,

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:06.360
literally the mother of all problems is who designed us.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.960
So assume success in that we're gonna transition

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.760
to the machines, making the machines,

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.280
and all of these new sort of social systems

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.000
we're describing will help manage them

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.320
and curate them and democratize them.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:25.120
If we close the gap I just led off with

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.880
of 10 to the 10 to 10 to the 18,

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.960
between ChipFab and you,

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.160
we're ultimately in many ways,

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.840
we're ultimately in marrying communication,

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.360
computation and fabrication

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.280
gonna be able to create unimaginable complexity.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.280
And how do you design that?

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.280
And so I'd say the deepest of all questions

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.360
that I've been working on

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.520
goes back to the oldest part of our genome.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.520
So in our genome, what are called Hox genes

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:09.600
and these are morpho genes

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:15.600
and nowhere in your genome is the number five.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.600
It doesn't store the fact that you have five fingers.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.440
What it stores is what's called a developmental program.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.280
It's a series of steps.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.800
And the steps have the character of like,

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.440
grow up a gradient or break symmetry.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.600
And at the end of that developmental program,

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.200
you have five fingers.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.200
So you are stored not as a body plan,

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.280
but as a growth plan.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.520
And there's two reasons for that.

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:50.560
One reason is just compression.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.680
Billions of genes can place trillions of cells.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.360
But the much deeper one is evolution

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.320
can randomly perturb.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.600
Almost anything you did randomly in the genome

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.880
would be fatal or inconsequential, but not interesting.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.960
But when you modify things in these developmental programs,

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.160
you go from like webs for swimming to fingers,

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.120
or you go from walking to wings for flying.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.640
It's a space in which search is interesting.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.640
So this is the heart of the success of AI.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:28.080
In part, it was the scaling we talked about a while ago.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:31.480
And in part, it was the representations

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.760
for which search is effective.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.840
AI has found good representations.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.680
It hasn't found new ways to search,

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.160
but it's found good representations of search.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.960
And you're saying that's what biology,

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.400
that's what evolution has done

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.120
is creative representations, structures,

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.560
biological structures through which search

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.560
is effective.

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:58.160
And so the developmental programs in the genome

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.160
beautifully encapsulate the lessons of AI.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.760
And this is, it's embodied, it's molecular intelligence.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.920
It's AI embodied in our genome.

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:13.440
It's every bit as profound as the cognition in our brain,

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.600
but now this is sort of thinking in molecular thinking

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.400
in how you design.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.400
And so it's a very interesting way

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.200
to design.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.160
And so I'd say the most fundamental problem

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.680
we're working on is it's kind of tautological

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:33.360
that when you design a phone, you design the phone.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:35.280
You represent the design of the phone.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.880
But that actually fails when you get to the sort

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.360
of complexity that we're talking about.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.440
And so there's this profound transition to come.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:46.240
Once I can have self-reproducing assemblers

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.360
placing 10 to the 18 parts,

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:54.360
you need to not sort of metaphorically, but create life

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.600
in that you need to learn how to evolve.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.800
But evolutionary design has a really misleading

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.440
trivial meaning.

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.480
It's not as simple as you randomly mutate things.

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:12.080
It's this much more deep embodiment of AI

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.800
and morphogenesis.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.360
Is there a way for us to continue

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.000
the kind of evolutionary design that led us to this place

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.760
from the early days of bacteria, single cell organism,

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.480
to ribosomes and the 20 amino acids?

01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:26.840
You mean for human augmentation?

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:30.560
For life, I mean, what would you call assemblers

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.600
that are self-replicating and placing parts?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:37.600
What is the dynamic complex things built

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.880
with digital fabrication?

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.720
What is that?

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.600
That's life.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.160
Yeah, so ultimately, absolutely,

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.600
if you add up everything I'm talking about,

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.520
it's building up to creating life in non-living materials.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.120
And I don't view this as copying life.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.320
I view it as deriving life.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.800
I didn't start from how does biology work

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.680
and then I'm gonna copy it.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.960
I start from how to solve problems

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.720
and then it leads me to, in a sense, rediscover biology.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.040
So if you go back to Valentina in Ghana

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.080
making her circuit board,

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.160
she still needs a chip fab very far away

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.880
to make the processor on her circuit board.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.720
For her to make the processor locally,

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.840
for all the reasons we described,

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.360
you actually need the deep things we were just talking about.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.160
And so it really does lead you.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.160
So let's see, there's a wonderful series of books by Gingery.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.200
Book one is How to Make a Charcoal Furnace

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.720
and at the end of book seven, you have a machine shop.

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.480
So it's sort of how you do

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.080
your own personal industrial revolution.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.000
ISRU is what NASA calls in situ resource utilization

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.760
and that's how do you go to a planet

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:59.920
and create a civilization.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.840
ISRU has essentially assumed Gingery.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.880
You go through the industrial revolution

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.560
and you create the inventory of 100,000 resistors.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.520
What we're finding is the way,

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.680
the minimum building blocks for a civilization

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.920
is roughly 20 parts.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.800
So what's interesting about the amino acids

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.400
is they're not interesting.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.840
They're hydrophobic or hydrophilic, basic or acidic.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.440
They have typical but not extremal properties,

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.720
but they're good enough you can combine them to make you.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.880
So what this is leading towards

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.880
is technology doesn't need enormous global supply chains.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.160
It just needs about 20 properties you can compose

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:43.760
to create all technology as the minimum building blocks

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.880
for a technological civilization.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.400
So there's going to be 20 basic building blocks

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.880
based on which the self-replicating assemblers can work.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.160
Right, and I say that not philosophically,

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.360
just empirically, sort of that's where it's heading.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:02.880
And I like thinking about how you bootstrap

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.800
a civilization on Mars, that problem.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.320
There's a fun video on bonus material for the movie

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.560
with a neat group of people, we talk about it

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.680
because it has really profound implications

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.240
back here on Earth about how we live sustainably.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.720
What is that civilization on Mars looks like

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.600
that's using ISRU, that's using these 20 building blocks

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.120
and does self-assembly?

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:27.120
Yeah, go through primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.800
You extract properties like conducting, insulating,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
semi-conducting, magnetic, dielectric, flexural.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.000
These are the kind of roughly 20 properties.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.360
With those, those are enough for us to assemble logic

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.480
and they're enough for us to assemble actuation.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:58.720
With logic and actuation, we can make micro robots.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.280
The micro robots can build bigger robots.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:07.640
The bigger robots can then take the building block materials

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.440
and make the structural elements

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.480
that you then do to make construction.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.080
And then you boot up through the stages

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.400
of a technological civilization.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.560
By the way, where in the span of logic and actuation

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.360
did the sensing come in?

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.520
Oh, I skipped over that.

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.520
But my favorite sensor is a step response.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.400
So if you just make a step and measure the response

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.200
to the electric field, that ranges from user interfaces

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.000
to positioning to material properties.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.280
And if you do it at higher frequencies, you get chemistry.

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:44.200
And you can get all of that

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.800
just from a step in an electric field.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.800
So for example, once you have time resolution in logic,

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.600
something as simple as two electrodes

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:58.200
let you do amazingly capable sensing.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.640
So we've been talking about all the work I do.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.360
There's a story about how it happens.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.480
Where do ideas come from?

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.480
That's an interesting story.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.560
Where do ideas come from?

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.160
So I had mentioned Vannevar Bush

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.960
and he wrote a really influential thing

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.520
called The Endless Frontier.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.200
So science won World War II.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.320
The more known story is nuclear bombs.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.880
The less well-known story is the Rad Lab.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.680
So at MIT, an amazing group of people invented radar

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.280
which is really credited as winning the war.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.480
So after the war, a grand old man from MIT

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:44.480
and was charged with science won the war.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.280
How do we maintain that edge?

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.600
And the report he wrote led to

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.520
the National Science Foundation

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.440
and the modern notion we take for granted

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.160
but didn't really exist before then

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.560
of public funding of research or research agencies.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.200
In it, he made again what I consider an important mistake

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.040
which is he described basic research

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:15.080
leads to applied research, leads to applications,

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.520
leads to commercialization, leads to impact.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.920
And so we need to invest in that pipeline.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.920
The reason I considered a mistake

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.880
is almost all of the examples we've been talking about

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.280
in my lab went backwards.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.600
That the basic research came from applications.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.600
And further, almost all of the examples

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.200
we've been talking about came fundamentally from mistakes.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:51.200
So essentially everything I've ever worked on has failed

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.640
but in failing something better happened.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.600
So the way I like to describe it is

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.200
ready aim fire is you do your homework,

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.440
you aim carefully at a target you want to accomplish

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.640
and if everything goes right,

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.880
you then hit the target and succeed.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.640
What I do, you can think of as ready fire aim.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.600
So you do a lot of work to get ready,

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.480
then you close your eyes and you don't really think

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.160
about where you're aiming

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.400
but you look very carefully at where you did aim.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:28.400
Where you aim after you fire and the reason

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.720
that's so important is if you do ready aim fire,

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.080
the best you can hope is hit what you aim at.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.040
So let me give you some examples.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.840
Because this is a source of great-

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.760
You're full of good lines today.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.560
Source of great frustration.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.160
Source of great frustration.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:51.280
So I mentioned the early quantum computing.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.480
So quantum computing is this power

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.680
of using quantum mechanics to make computers

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.880
that for some problems are dramatically more powerful

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.000
than classical computers.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.520
Before it started, there was a really interesting group

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:09.520
of people who knew a lot about physics and computing

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.560
that were inventing what became quantum computing

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.120
before it was clear anything,

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.600
there was an opportunity there.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.320
It was just studying how those relate.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.320
Here's how it fits to the ready fire aim.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.240
I was doing really short-term work in my lab

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.920
on shoplifting tags.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.960
This was really before there was modern RFID.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:35.400
And so how you put tags in objects to sense them,

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.480
something we just take for granted commercially.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.600
And there was a problem of how you can sense

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.480
multiple objects at the same time.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.880
And so I was studying how you can remotely sense materials

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.480
to make low-cost tags that could let you distinguish

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.680
multiple objects simultaneously.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.880
To do that, you need non-linearity

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.200
so that the signal is modulated.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.120
And so I was looking for material sources of non-linearity

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:08.120
and that led me to look at how nuclear spins interact.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.040
Just for spin resonance,

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.280
the sort of things you use when you go in an MRI machine.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.400
And so I was studying how to use that.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.880
And it turns out that it was a bad idea.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:25.880
You couldn't remotely use it for shoplifting tags,

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.920
but I realized you could compute.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.920
And so with a group of colleagues

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.640
thinking about early quantum computing,

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.240
like David DiVincenzo and Charlie Bennett,

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.080
was articulating what are the properties

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.480
you need to compute.

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.760
And then looking at how to make the tags,

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.320
it turns out the tags were a terrible idea

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:51.320
for sensing objects in a supermarket checkout,

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:54.600
but I realized they were computing.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.760
So with Ike Chuang and a few other people,

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.440
we realized we could program nuclear spins to compute.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:03.880
And so that's what we use to do Grover's search algorithm.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.200
And then it was used for a Shor's factoring algorithm.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.560
And it worked out.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.240
The systems we did it in nuclear magnetic resonance

01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:14.160
don't scale beyond a few qubits,

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.400
but the techniques have lived on.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.200
And so all the current quantum computing techniques

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:24.720
grew out of the ways we would talk to these spins.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.600
But I'm telling this whole story

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:30.600
because it came from a bad way to make a shoplifting tag.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.240
Starting with an application,

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.800
mistakes led to the fundamental science.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.800
I mean, can you just link on that?

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.800
I mean, just using nuclear spins to do computation,

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.800
like what gave you the guts to try to think through this,

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.520
from a digital fabrication perspective, actually,

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.120
how to leap from one to the other?

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.520
I wouldn't call it guts, I would call it collaboration.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.880
So at IBM, there was this,

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.560
there was this amazing group of like,

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:05.000
I mentioned Charlie Bennett and David DiVincenzo

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.160
and Ralph Landauer and Nabil Amir.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.640
And these were all gods of thinking

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.000
about physics and computing.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000
So I yelled at the whole computer industry

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:22.840
being based on a fiction, Metropolis,

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.280
programmers frolicking in the garden

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.320
while somebody moves levers in the basement.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.760
There's a complete parallel history

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:34.600
of Maxwell to Boltzmann to Szilard to Landauer to Bennett.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.200
Most people won't know most of these names,

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.960
but this whole parallel history thinking deeply

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.320
about how computation and physics relate.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:48.720
So I was collaborating with that whole group of people.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:53.360
And then at MIT, I was in this high traffic environment.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.760
I wasn't deeply inspired to think about

01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.680
better ways to detect shoplifting tags,

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:01.200
but stumbled across companies that needed help with that

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.680
and was thinking about it.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.200
And then I realized those two worlds intersected

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.680
and we could use the failed approach

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.840
for the shoplifting tags

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.560
to make early quantum computing algorithms.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.240
And this kind of stumbling is fundamental

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.040
to the Fab Lab idea, right?

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.960
Right, here's one more example.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.960
With the student Manu, we talked about ribosomes.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.880
And I was trying to build a ribosome

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.600
that worked on fluids so that I could place

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.680
the little parts we're talking about.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.360
And it kept failing because bubbles would come

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.200
into our system and the bubbles would make

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.800
the whole thing stop working.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.200
And we spent about half a year trying

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:42.120
to get rid of the bubbles.

01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.040
Then Manu said, wait a minute,

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:47.120
the bubbles are actually better than what we're doing.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.600
We should just use the bubbles.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.280
And so we invented how to do universal object

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.760
with logic with little bubbles and fluid.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.680
Okay, you have to explain this microfluidic bubble logic.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.000
Please, how does this work?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:03.840
It's super interesting.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.560
Yeah, and so I'll come back and explain it.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:10.600
But what it led to was we showed fluids could do,

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.880
it'd been known fluid could do logic,

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.520
like your old automobile transmissions do logic,

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.640
but that's macroscopic.

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.960
It didn't work at little scales.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.920
We showed with these bubbles,

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.000
we could do it at little scales.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.480
Then I'm gonna come back and explain it.

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.320
But what came out of that is Manu then showed

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:30.960
you could make a 50 cent microscope using little bubbles.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.520
And then the techniques we developed are what we use

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:37.840
to transplant genomes to make synthetic life.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.880
All came out of the failure

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:43.640
of trying to make the genome, the ribosome.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.560
Now, so the way the bubble logic works is

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:52.320
in a little channel, fluid at small scales is fairly viscous.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.120
It's sort of like pushing jello, think of it as.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:06.840
If a bubble gets stuck, the fluid has to detour around it.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:12.920
So now imagine a channel that has two wells and one bubble.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.240
If the bubble is in one well,

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.760
the fluid has to go in the other channel.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.240
If the fluid is in the other well,

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:21.280
it has to go in the first channel.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:26.280
So the position of the bubble can switch,

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:30.280
it's a switch, it can switch the fluid between two channels.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.400
So now we have one element, a switch.

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.760
And it's also a memory because you can detect

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.200
whether or not a bubble is stored there.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.560
Then if two bubbles meet,

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:44.200
if you have two channels crossing,

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.920
a bubble can go through one way

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.960
or a bubble can go through the other way.

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:50.840
But if two bubbles come together,

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:53.000
then they push on each other and one goes one way

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.400
and one goes the other way.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.480
That's a logic operation, that's a logic gate.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.240
So we now have a switch, we have a memory,

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.280
and we have a logic gate,

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.120
and that's everything you need

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.400
to make a universal computer.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.760
I mean, the fact that you did that with bubbles

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:10.760
and microfluid is just kind of brilliant.

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.800
Well, so I mean, to stay with that example,

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.080
what we proposed to do was to make a fluidic ribosome

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.760
and the project crashed and burned.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.240
It was a disaster.

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.200
This is what came out of it.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.680
And so it was precisely ready fire aim

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.760
in that we had to do a lot of homework

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:36.000
to be able to make these microfluidic systems.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.920
The fire part was we didn't think too hard

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.040
about making the ribosome.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.520
We just tried to do it.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.840
The aim part was we realized the ribosome failed,

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.560
but something better had happened.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.720
And if you look all across research funding,

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.480
research management, it doesn't anticipate this.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.360
So fail fast is familiar,

01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:01.080
but fail fast tends to miss ready and aim.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.200
You can't just fail.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.240
You have to do your homework before the fail part

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.080
and you have to do the aim part after the fail part.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.960
And so the whole language of research

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:12.160
is about like milestones and deliverables.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.960
That works when you're going down a straight line,

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.560
but it doesn't work for this kind of discovery.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:20.240
And to leap to something you said that's really important

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.920
is I view part of what the FabLab network is doing

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:28.120
is giving more people the opportunity to fail.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000
You've said that geometry is really important in biology.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.840
What does fabrication biology look like?

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.760
Why is geometry important?

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.400
So molecular biology is dominated by geometry.

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.400
That's why the protein folding is so important

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.200
that the geometry gives the function.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.920
And there's this hierarchical construction

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.320
of as you go through primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary,

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.360
the shapes of the molecules

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.960
make the shape of the molecular machines.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.040
And they really are exquisite machines.

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:13.040
If you look at how your muscles move,

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:15.600
if you were to see a simulation of it,

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.000
it would look like a improbable science fiction cyborg world

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.080
of these little walking robots that walk on a discrete lattice.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.280
They're really exquisite machines.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.520
And then from there, there's this whole hierarchical stack of,

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.240
once you get to the top of that,

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:36.040
you then start making organelles that make cells,

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.440
that make organs through the stack of that hierarchy.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.520
Just stepping back, does it amaze you

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.360
that from small building blocks

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.280
where amino acids you mentioned, molecules,

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:51.400
let's go to the very beginning of hydrogen and helium

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:53.080
at the start of this universe,

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:57.560
that we're able to build up such complex

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:00.760
and beautiful things like our human brain?

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.760
So studying thermodynamics,

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.920
which is exactly the question of

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:13.840
batteries run out and need recharging.

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.360
Equipment, cars get old and fail,

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:23.360
yet life doesn't.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:27.040
And that's why there's a sense in which life

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:28.840
seems to violate thermodynamics,

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.120
although of course it doesn't.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.360
It seems to resist the march towards entropy somehow.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.480
Right, and so Maxwell,

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.880
who helped give rise to the science of thermodynamics,

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.600
posited a problem that was so infuriating

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.080
it led to a series of suicides.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.440
There was a series of advisors and advisees,

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:56.680
three in a row that all ended up committing suicide

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:59.120
that happened to work on this problem.

01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:04.120
And Maxwell's demon is this simple but infamous problem

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:11.640
where right now in this room we're surrounded by molecules

01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:13.480
and they run at different velocities.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.480
Imagine a container that has a wall

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:21.600
and it's got gas on both sides and a little door.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:26.000
And if the door is a molecular sized creature

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.280
and it could watch the molecules coming,

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.320
and when a fast molecule is coming, it opens the door.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.800
When a slow molecule is coming, it closes the door.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.800
After it does that for a while,

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.160
one side is hot, one is cold.

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.640
When something is hot and is cold, you can make an engine.

01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.880
And so you close that and you make an engine

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:45.920
and you make energy.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:51.600
So the demon is violating thermodynamics

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.080
because it's never touching the molecule,

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:58.600
yet by just opening and closing the door,

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.840
it can make arbitrary amounts of energy

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.560
and power a machine.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.320
And in thermodynamics, you can't do that.

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.680
So that's Maxwell's demon.

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:11.640
That problem is connected to everything we just spoke about

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:12.800
for the last few hours.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:17.800
So Leo Szilard around early 1900s was a deep physicist

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.480
who then had a lot to do with also post-war

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:32.400
anti-nuclear things.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:37.320
Things, but he reduced Maxwell's demon

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.720
to a single molecule.

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.720
So the molecule, there's only one molecule

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.920
and the question is, which side of the partition is it on?

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:48.960
That led to the idea of one bit of information.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:53.560
So Shannon credited Szilard's analysis of Maxwell's demon

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.480
for the invention of the bit.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.920
For many years, people tried to explain Maxwell's demon

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:04.880
by the energy in the demon looking at the molecule

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.440
or the energy to open and close the door

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.040
and nothing ever made sense.

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.720
Finally, Rolf Landauer,

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.480
one of the colleagues I mentioned at IBM,

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.360
finally solved the problem.

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:23.920
He showed that you can explain Maxwell's demon

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:27.120
by you need the mind of the demon.

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:33.040
When the demon open and closes the door,

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:36.080
as long as it remembers what it did,

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.600
you can run the whole thing backwards.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.680
But when the demon forgets,

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:45.960
then you can't run it backwards

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:49.080
and that's where you get dissipation

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.920
and that's where you get the violation of thermodynamics.

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.440
And so the explanation of Maxwell's demon

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:56.800
is that it's in the demon's brain.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:02.240
So then Rolf's colleague Charlie at IBM

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.240
then shocked Rolf by showing

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:10.040
you can compute with arbitrarily low energy.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:13.200
So one of the things that's not well covered

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:18.200
is that the big computers used for big machine learning,

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:22.040
the data centers used tens of megawatts of power.

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.760
They use as much power as a city.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:27.720
Charlie showed you can actually compute

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:30.800
with arbitrarily low amounts of energy

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:34.480
by making computers that can go backwards as well as forwards.

01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.120
And what limits the speed of the computer

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.320
is how fast you want an answer

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.040
and how certain you want the answer to be.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:47.440
But we're orders of magnitude away from that.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:50.320
So I have a student, Cameron, working with Lincoln Labs

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:53.120
on making superconducting computers

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:56.840
that operate near this Landauer limit

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.040
that are orders of magnitude more efficient.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.840
So stepping back to all of that,

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:05.680
that whole tour was driven by your question about life

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:10.000
and right at the heart of it is Maxwell's demon.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.360
Life exists because it can locally violate thermodynamics.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:16.480
It can locally violate thermodynamics

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.880
because of intelligence

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.640
and it's molecular intelligence

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:25.760
that I would even go out on a limb to say,

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:29.680
we can already see we're beginning to come to the end

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.280
of this current AI phase.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.000
So depending on how you count,

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.960
this is I'd say the fifth AI boom bust cycle.

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:40.200
And you can already, it's exploding,

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.840
but you can already see where it's heading,

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:46.880
how it's going to saturate what happens on the far side.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.920
The big thing that's not yet on horizons

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:55.920
is embodied AI, molecular intelligence.

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:59.000
So to step back to this AI story,

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:05.120
there was automation and that was gonna change everything.

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:07.120
Then there were expert systems.

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:14.000
There was then the first phase of the neural network systems.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.560
There've been about five of these.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.320
In each case, on the slope up,

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.000
it's gonna change everything.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.800
Each case, what happens is on the slope down,

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:28.360
we sort of move the goal posts

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.920
and it becomes sort of irrelevant.

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:33.280
So a good example is going up,

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.320
computer chess was gonna change everything.

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.600
Once computers could play chess,

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.520
that fundamentally changes the world.

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.560
Now on the downside, computers play chess.

01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.440
Winning at chess is no longer seen as a unique human thing,

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:48.120
but people still play chess.

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:51.200
This new phase is gonna take a new chunk of things

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:53.000
that we thought computers couldn't do,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.440
now computers will be able to do.

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.360
They have roughly our brain capacity,

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:01.120
but we'll keep thinking as well as computers.

01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.720
And as I described,

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:06.000
while we've been going through these five boom busts,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.440
if you just look at the numbers of ops per second,

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.920
bits storage, bits of IO, that's the more interesting one.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:12.880
That's been steady

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.920
and that's what finally caught up to people.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.880
But as we've talked about a couple of times,

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:20.680
there's eight orders of magnitude to go,

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.120
not in the intelligence in the transistors or in the brain,

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.800
but in the embodied intelligence,

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.440
in the intelligence in our body.

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.480
So the intelligent constructions of physical systems

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.640
that would embody the intelligence

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:34.800
versus contain it within the computation.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:38.200
Right, and there's a brain centrism

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:42.800
that assumes our intelligence is centered in our brain.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:45.200
In endless ways in this conversation,

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.480
we've been talking about molecular intelligence.

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:49.640
Our molecular systems

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:53.040
do a deep kind of artificial intelligence.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.680
All the things you think of as artificial intelligence does

01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:01.680
in representing knowledge, storing knowledge,

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.560
searching over knowledge, adapting to knowledge,

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.840
our molecular systems do,

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:11.080
but the output isn't just a thought, it's us.

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:13.000
It's the evolution of us.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And the real horizon to come is now embodying AI,

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.800
not just a processor and a robot,

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:25.800
but building systems that really can grow and evolve.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.600
So we've been speaking about this boundary

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.800
between bits and atoms.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.760
So let me ask you about one of the big mysteries

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.960
of consciousness.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:41.800
Do you think it comes from somewhere between that boundary?

01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.760
I won't name names,

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.080
but if you know who I'm talking about,

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.280
it's probably clear.

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:49.520
I once did a drive,

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:53.760
in fact, up to the Mussolini era villa outside Torino

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:58.000
in the early days of what became quantum computing

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.640
with a famous person

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.440
who thinks about quantum mechanics and consciousness.

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.720
And we had the most infuriating conversation

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:10.320
that went roughly along the lines of

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:14.880
consciousness is weird,

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.280
quantum mechanics is weird,

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:20.560
therefore quantum mechanics explains consciousness.

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.360
That was roughly the logical process.

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.120
And you're not satisfied with that process?

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.600
No, and I say that very precisely in the following sense.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.880
I was a program manager somewhat by accident

01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:37.880
in a DARPA program on quantum biology.

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.560
And so biology trivially uses quantum mechanics

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:45.800
and that were made out of atoms.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.360
But the distinction is in quantum computing,

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.160
quantum information, you need quantum coherence.

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.080
And there's a lot of muddled thinking about

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.800
like collapse of the wave function

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.960
and claims of quantum computing that garbles

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.960
just quantum coherence that you can think of it

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.560
as a wave that has very special properties,

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:12.760
but these wave like properties.

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:16.640
And so there's a small set of places

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.080
where biology uses quantum mechanics in that deeper sense.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:26.080
One is how light is converted to energy in photo systems.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.240
It looks like one is all faction,

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:31.840
how your nose is able to tell different smells.

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:37.240
Probably one has to do with how birds navigate,

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.200
how they sense magnetic fields.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:44.640
That involves a coupling between a very weak energy

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.080
with a magnetic field, coupling into chemical reactions.

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:50.680
And there's a beautiful system.

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.160
Standard in chemistry is magnetic fields

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.200
like this can't influence chemistry,

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.040
but there are biological circuits

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.240
that are carefully balanced with two pathways

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:04.560
that become unbalanced with magnetic fields.

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:08.000
So each of these areas are expensive for biology.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.680
It has to consume resources

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.520
to use quantum mechanics in this way.

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.600
So again, those are places where we know

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.680
there's quantum mechanics in biology.

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.320
In cognition, there's just no evidence.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.320
There's no evidence of anything quantum mechanical going on

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.880
in how cognition works.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:27.720
Consciousness.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.880
Well, I'm saying cognition, I'm not saying consciousness,

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.440
but to get from cognition to consciousness.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:38.840
So McCullough and Pitts made a model of neurons

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:43.520
that led to perceptrons

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.120
that then through a couple of boom busts

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.400
led to deep learning.

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:50.240
One of the interesting things about that sequence

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:54.960
is it diverged off of the quantum mechanics

01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:00.120
so deep neural networks used in machine learning

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:03.200
diverged from trying to understand how the brain works.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:09.040
What makes them work, what's emerged is,

01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:10.720
it's a really interesting story.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:13.120
This may be too much of a technical detail,

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.320
but it has to do with function approximation.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.640
We had talked about exponentials.

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.640
A deep network needs an exponentially larger,

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:27.160
shallow network to do the same function.

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.840
And that exponential is what gives the power

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.480
to deep networks.

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.800
But what's interesting is the sort of lessons

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.440
about building these deep architectures

01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:41.320
and how to train them have really interesting echoes

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:43.280
to how brains work.

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:45.320
And there's an interesting conversation

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.200
that's sort of coming back of neuroscientists

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.560
looking over the shoulder

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.360
of people training these deep networks,

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:54.760
seeing interesting echoes for how the brain works,

01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.640
interesting parallels with it.

01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.520
And so I didn't say consciousness, I just said cognition,

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:05.160
but I don't know any experimental evidence

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:07.520
that points to anything in neurobiology

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:10.040
that says we need quantum mechanics.

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:15.040
And I view the question about whether a large language model

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:21.040
is conscious as silly in that biology is full of hacks

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:29.440
and it works.

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.680
There's no evidence we have that there's anything

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.040
deeper going on than just this sort of stacking up

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:38.360
of hacks in the brain.

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:40.800
And somehow consciousness is one of the hacks

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.640
or an emergent property of the hacks.

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:43.520
Absolutely.

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.680
And just numerically I said big computations

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.440
now have the degrees of freedom of the brain.

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.200
And they're showing a lot of the phenomenology

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.040
of what we think is properties of what a brain can do.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:02.360
And I don't see any reason to invoke anything else.

01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:04.840
That makes you wonder what kind of beautiful stuff

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.840
digital fabrication will create.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.800
If biology created a few hacks

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:11.400
on top of which consciousness and cognition,

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:15.400
some of the things we love about human beings was created.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:19.920
It makes you wonder what kind of beauty in the complexity

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.880
can create digital fabrication.

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:23.640
There's an early peak at that,

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.720
which is there's a misleading term,

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:29.160
which is generative design.

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:32.760
Generative design is where you don't tell a computer

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:33.760
how to design something,

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:36.400
you tell the computer what you want it to do.

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.920
That doesn't work, that only works in limited subdomains.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.040
You can't do really complex functionality that way.

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.080
The one place it's matured though

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:48.520
is topology optimization for structure.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:52.200
So let's say you wanted to make a bicycle or a table.

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.800
You describe the loads on it

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:57.920
and it figures out how to design it.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:01.560
And what it makes are beautiful organic looking things.

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.440
These are things that look like they grew in a forest

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.040
and they look like they grew in a forest

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.920
because that's sort of exactly what they are,

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:12.880
that they're solving the ways of how you handle loads

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:14.200
in the same way biology does.

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:17.000
And so you get things that look like trees and shells

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:17.840
and all of that.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.920
And so that's a peak at this transition

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:24.920
from we design to we teach the machines how to design.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.040
What can you say about,

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.480
because you mentioned cellular automata earlier,

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.480
about from this example you just gave

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.360
and in general the observation you can make

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:35.800
by looking at cellular automata,

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:40.320
that from simple rules and simple building blocks

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.480
can emerge arbitrary complexity.

01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:48.480
Do you understand what that is, how that can be leveraged?

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.680
So understand what it is is much easier than it sounds.

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.920
I complained about Turing's machine

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.280
making a physics mistake,

01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:01.560
but Turing never intended it to be a computer architecture.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:06.240
He used it just to prove results about uncomputability.

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:10.800
What Turing did on what is computation is exquisite,

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:11.800
is gorgeous.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.360
He gave us our notion of computational universality

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:21.360
and something that sounds deep and turns out to be trivial

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:26.640
is it's really easy to show almost everything

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:29.240
as computationally universal.

01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:33.240
So Norm Margulis wrote a beautiful paper

01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:37.720
with Tom Toffoli showing in a cellular,

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:41.600
a cellular automata world is like the game of life

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.840
where you just move tokens around.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:48.600
They showed that modeling billiard balls

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:52.360
on a billiard table with cellular automata

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:53.800
is a universal computer.

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.520
To be universal, you need a persistent state,

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.000
you need a nonlinear operation to interact them,

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.480
and you need connectivity.

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:11.320
So that's what you need to show computational universality.

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.560
So they showed that a CA modeling billiard balls

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:17.520
is a universal computer.

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.600
Chris Moore went on to show that instead of chaos,

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:26.960
let's see, Turing showed they're problems in computation

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.160
that you can't solve,

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:31.280
that they're harder than you can't predict,

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.640
they're actually in a deep reason, they are unsolvable.

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.240
Chris Moore showed it's very easy to make physical systems

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:43.320
that are uncomputable, that what the physics system does,

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.400
just bouncing balls and surfaces,

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:48.760
you can make systems that solve uncomputable problems.

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.520
And so almost any non-trivial physical system

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:54.680
is computationally universal.

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:57.640
So the first part of the answer to your question is,

01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:00.560
this comes back to my comment about

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.880
how do you bootstrap a civilization,

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:06.720
you just don't need much to be computationally universal.

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.720
So then there isn't today a notion

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:14.040
of like fabricational universality

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.280
or fabricational complexity.

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:18.400
The sort of numbers I've been giving you

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.800
about you eating lunch versus the chip fab,

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.480
sort of that's in the same spirit of what Shannon did,

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:31.480
but once you connect computational universality

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.240
to kind of fabricational universality,

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:39.240
you then get the ability to grow and adapt and evolve.

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.560
Because that evolution happens in the physical space

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:43.400
and that's ultimately-

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.720
And so that's why, for me,

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:49.720
the heart of this whole conversation is morphogenesis.

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:51.960
So just to come back to that,

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:58.800
what Turing ended his sadly cut short life studying

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.640
was how genes give rise to form.

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:10.480
So how the relatively, in effect,

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:12.200
small amount of information in the genome

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.560
can give rise to the complexity of who you are.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:20.560
And that's where what resides is this molecular intelligence,

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.000
which is first how to describe you,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.400
but then how to describe you such that you can exist

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:33.600
and you can reproduce and you can grow and you can evolve.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.600
And so that's the seat of our molecular intelligence.

01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:41.120
The maker revolution in biology.

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:44.320
Yeah, it really is.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:45.160
It really is.

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:49.360
And that's where you can't separate communication,

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.960
computation, and fabrication.

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.760
You can't separate computer science and physical science.

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:56.000
You can't separate hardware and software.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.360
They all intersect right at that place.

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:02.680
Do you think of our universe as just one giant computation?

01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:08.880
I would even kind of say quantum computing is overhyped

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.600
in that there's a few things

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.400
quantum computing is gonna be good at.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.160
One is breaking crypto systems,

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:16.080
but we know how to make new crypto systems.

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.000
What it's really good at is modeling other quantum systems.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.240
So for studying nanotechnology, it's gonna be powerful.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:27.200
But quantum computing is not going to disrupt

01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:29.000
and change everything.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.080
But the reason I say that is this interesting group

01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:36.600
of strange people who helped invent quantum computing

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:39.360
before it was clear anything was there.

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.200
One of the main reasons they did it

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:46.440
wasn't to make a computer that can break a crypto system.

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.840
It was you could turn this backwards.

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:52.280
You could be surprised quantum mechanics can compute,

01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:55.280
or you can go in the opposite direction

01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:58.520
and say if quantum mechanics can compute,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.840
that's a description of nature.

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:05.240
So physics is written

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.320
in terms of partial differential equations.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:13.320
That is an information technology from two centuries ago.

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:21.240
The equations of physics are not,

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.720
this would sound very strange to say,

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:24.080
but the equations of physics,

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.160
Schrodinger's equations and Maxwell's equations

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:28.760
and all of them are not fundamental.

01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:31.000
They're a representation of physics

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.800
that was accessible to us in the era

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.760
of having a pencil and a piece of paper.

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.520
They have a fundamental problem,

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:45.600
which is if you make a dot on a piece of paper,

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.560
in traditional physics theory,

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:51.880
there's infinite information in that dot.

01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:55.400
A point has infinite information.

01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:00.760
That can't be true because information

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:05.960
is a fundamental resource that's connected to energy.

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:09.960
And in fact, one of my favorite questions

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:13.160
you can ask a cosmologist to trip them up

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:17.760
is ask is information a conserved quantity in the universe?

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:20.240
Was all the information created in the Big Bang

01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.920
or can the universe create information?

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:24.800
And I've yet to meet a cosmologist

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:29.240
who doesn't stutter and not clearly know

01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:31.880
how to handle that existential question.

01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:35.160
But sort of putting that to a side,

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.040
in physics theory, the way it's taught,

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:43.280
information comes late.

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:46.440
You're taught about X, a variable,

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:48.240
which can contain infinite information,

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.360
but physically that's unrealistic.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.960
And so physics theories have to find ways to cut that off.

01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:57.880
So instead, there are a number of people

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.240
who start with a theory of the universe

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.680
should start with information and computation

01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:09.560
as the fundamental resources that explain nature.

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:11.720
And then you build up from that

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.800
to something that looks like throwing baseballs down a slope.

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:20.800
And so in that sense, the work on physics and computation

01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:24.640
has many applications that we've been talking about,

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:29.040
but more deeply, it's really getting at new ways

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.200
to think about how the universe works.

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.760
And there are a number of things

01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:34.840
that are hard to do in traditional physics

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.920
that make more sense when you start

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:39.160
with information and computation

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:41.240
as the root of physical theory.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:42.600
So information and computation

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:46.040
being the real fundamental thing in the universe.

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:49.000
Right, that information is a resource.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.880
You can't have infinite information in finite space.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.320
Information propagates and interacts.

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:58.760
And from there, you erect the scaffolding of physics.

01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.520
Now it happens, the words I just said

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:04.320
look a lot like quantum field theories.

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:08.560
But there's an interesting way where instead of starting

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.040
with differential equations to get to quantum field theories

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:16.200
and quantum field theories, you get to quantization.

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:21.280
If you start from computation and information,

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:24.720
you begin sort of quantized and you build up from there.

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.880
And so that's the sense in which

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:31.240
absolutely I think about the universe as a computer.

01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:34.120
The easy way to understand that is

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.880
just almost anything is computationally universal,

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.920
but the deep way is it's a real fundamental way

01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:43.880
to understand how the universe works.

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.560
Let me go a little bit to the personal

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:50.440
and with the Center of Bits and Atoms.

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:52.400
You have

01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:57.920
worked with, the students you've worked with

01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:00.360
have gone on to do some incredible things in this world,

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:02.840
including build supercomputers that power

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:05.520
Facebook and Twitter and so on.

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.760
What advice would you give to young people?

01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.160
What advice have you given them

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:14.120
how to have one heck of a great career,

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.920
one heck of a great life?

01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:17.360
One important one is

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:23.520
if you look at junior faculty trying to get tenure

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:25.440
at a place like MIT,

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:28.400
the ones who try to figure out how to get tenure

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.720
are miserable and don't get tenure.

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:33.400
And the ones who don't try to figure it out

01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:34.720
are happy and do get it.

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:39.160
You have to love what you're doing and believe in it

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:42.960
and nothing else could possibly be

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.480
what you wanna be doing with your life

01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:46.560
and it gets you out of bed in the morning.

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.160
And again, it sounds naive, but

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.280
within the limited domain I'm describing now

01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:57.280
of getting tenure at MIT, that's a key attribute to it.

01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.480
And then same sense,

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.200
if you take the outlier students we're talking about,

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.040
99 out of 100 come to me and say,

01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:07.520
your work is very fascinating,

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.120
I'd be interesting to work for you.

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:13.400
And one out of 100 come and say,

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:18.400
you're wrong, here's your mistake,

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.280
here's what you should have been doing.

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:26.480
They just sort of say, I'm here and get to work.

01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:29.840
And again, I don't know how far this resource goes.

01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:33.760
So I've said I consider the world's greatest resource

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:36.040
this engine of bright inventive people

01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:39.200
of which we only see a tiny little iceberg of it.

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.040
And everywhere we open these labs,

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:43.280
they come out of the woodwork.

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:45.920
We didn't create all these educational programs,

01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:47.760
all these other things I'm describing.

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:51.160
We tried to partner everywhere with local schools

01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:53.640
and local companies and kept tripping over dysfunction

01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:55.240
and find we had to create the environment

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:56.800
where people like this can flourish.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:00.040
And so I don't know if this is everyone,

01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:02.520
if it's 1% of society, what the fraction is,

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.600
but it's so many orders of magnitude bigger

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.000
than we see today.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.360
We've been racing to keep up with it

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:10.320
to take advantage of that resource.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:11.760
Something tells me it's a very large

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.240
fraction of the population.

01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:15.640
I mean, the thing that gives me most hope

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:18.800
for the future is that population.

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:21.160
Once a year, this whole lab network meets

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.040
and it's my favorite gathering, it's in Bhutan this year,

01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:26.680
because it's every body shape,

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:28.800
it's every language, every geography,

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.640
but it's the same person in all those packages.

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:36.640
It's the same sense of bright inventive joy and discovery.

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.320
If there's people listening to this

01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:41.640
and they're just overwhelmed with how exciting this is,

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.200
which I think there would be,

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.240
how can they participate?

01:54:44.240 --> 01:54:45.080
How can they help?

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.160
How can they encourage young people or themselves

01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.880
to build stuff, to create stuff?

01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:51.920
Yeah, that's a great question.

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:56.920
So this is part of a much bigger maker movement

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.520
that has a lot of embodiments.

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:03.320
The part I've been involved in, this FabLab network,

01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:06.160
you can think of as a curated part that works as a network.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:09.200
So you don't benefit in a gym

01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:11.720
if somebody exercises in another gym,

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:14.800
but in the Fab network, you do in a sense benefit

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:17.400
when somebody works in another lab

01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:19.480
in the way it functions as a network.

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:23.520
So you can come to cba.mit.edu

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:26.280
to see the research we're talking about.

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:29.400
There's a Fab Foundation run by Sherry Lassiter

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:31.440
at fabfoundation.org.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:35.280
Fablabs.io is a portal into this lab network.

01:55:36.760 --> 01:55:39.480
fabacademy.org is this distributed,

01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:41.920
hands-on educational program.

01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:44.880
fab.city is the platform of cities producing

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:45.720
what they consume.

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.560
Those are all nodes in this network.

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.280
So you can learn with Fab Academy

01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.000
and you can perhaps launch or help launch

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.600
or participate in launching a Fab Lab.

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:59.120
Well, and in particular, from one to a thousand,

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.640
we carefully counted labs.

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:03.000
Now we're going from a thousand to a million,

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.240
where it ceases to become interesting to count them.

01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:07.960
And in the thousand to the million,

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.840
what's interesting about that stage is technologically,

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:15.200
you go to a lab not to get access to the machine,

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:17.840
but you go to the lab to make the machine.

01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:20.120
But the other thing interesting in it

01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:22.560
is we have an interesting collaboration

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.360
on a Fab Lab in a box.

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:30.680
And this came out of a collaboration with SolidWorks

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:34.880
on how you can put a Fab Lab in a box,

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:37.720
which is not just the tools, but the knowledge.

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:42.040
So you open the box and the box contains the knowledge

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:45.600
of how to use it as well as the tools within it,

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.240
so that the knowledge can propagate.

01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:50.000
And so we have an interesting group of people working on,

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:52.880
the original Fab Labs, we'd have a whole team

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:56.240
to get involved in the setting up and training.

01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:58.680
And the Fab Academy is a real in-depth,

01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:01.000
deep technical program in the training.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.320
But in this next phase,

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.040
how sort of the lab itself knows how to do the lab.

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:11.040
That it's, we've talked deeply about the intelligence

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:14.520
in fabrication, but in a much more accessible one

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:19.480
about how the AI in the lab in a fact

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:23.280
becomes a collaborator with you in this near term

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.440
to help get started.

01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:28.440
And for people wanting to connect,

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:31.040
it can seem like a big step, a big threshold,

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:32.840
but we've gotten to thousands of these

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.200
and they're doubling exactly that way

01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:37.560
just from people opting in.

01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:40.440
And in so doing, driving towards this kind of idea

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.800
of personal digital fabrication.

01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:46.480
Yeah, and it's not utopia, it's not free,

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:51.480
but come back to today, we separately have education,

01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:55.440
we have big business, we have startups,

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.880
we have entertainment, sort of each of these things

01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:59.600
are segregated.

01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.880
When you have global connection

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.080
to one of these local facilities,

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:07.720
in that you can do play and art and education

01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:09.400
and create infrastructure.

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:13.640
You can make many of the things you consume.

01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:15.000
You could make it for yourself,

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.720
it could be done on a community school,

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:19.120
it could be done on a regional scale.

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.240
It really, I'd say the research we spent

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:27.720
the last few hours talking about, I thought was hard.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:32.720
And in a sense, I mean, it's non-trivial,

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:35.280
but in a sense, it's just sort of playing out,

01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.520
we're turning the crank.

01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:39.080
What I didn't think was hard is

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:43.600
if anybody can make almost anything anywhere,

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:45.440
how do you live, how do you learn,

01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:47.440
how do you work, how you play?

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:50.960
These very basic assumptions about how society functions.

01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:54.800
There's a way in which it's kind of back to the future

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:59.800
in that this mode where work is money is consumption

01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:03.640
and consumption is shopping by selecting

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:07.320
is only a kind of a few decade old stretch.

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:12.960
In some ways, we're getting back to a Sami village

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:17.240
in North Norway is deeply sustainable,

01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:22.000
but rather than just reverting to living

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:24.280
the way we did a few thousand years ago,

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.120
being connected globally,

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:30.680
having the benefits of modern society,

01:59:30.680 --> 01:59:34.480
but connecting it back to older notions of sustainability.

01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:38.880
I hadn't remotely anticipated

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:40.680
just how fundamentally that challenge

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:43.800
is how a society functions and how interesting

01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:47.840
and how hard it is to figure out how we can make that work.

01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:50.480
And it's possible that this kind of process

01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:54.880
will give a deeper sense of meaning to each person.

01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:58.080
Let me violently agree in two ways.

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:03.080
One way is this community making

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:09.360
crosses many sensitive sectarian boundaries

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.960
in many parts of the world

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:15.640
where there's just implicit or explicit conflict,

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:18.760
but sort of this act of making

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:22.720
seems to transcend a lot of historical divisions.

02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:24.440
I don't say that philosophically,

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.440
I just say that as an observation.

02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:30.040
And I think there's something really fundamental

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:31.760
in what you said, which is,

02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:35.960
deep in our brain is shaping our environment.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.920
A lot of what's strange about our society

02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:44.120
is the way that we can't do that.

02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:49.000
The act of shaping our environment

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.240
touches something really, really deep

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:53.960
that gets to the essence of who we are.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.800
That's again why I say that in a way,

02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:00.240
the most important thing made in these labs

02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:01.480
is making itself.

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:06.280
What do you think if this shaping of our environment

02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:07.240
gets to something deep,

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.640
what do you think is the meaning of it all?

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:11.240
What's the meaning of life, Neil?

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:17.240
I can tell you my insights into how life works.

02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:21.960
I can tell you my insights in how to make life

02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.720
meaningful and fulfilling and sustainable.

02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:31.360
I have no idea what the meaning of life is,

02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:33.760
but maybe that's the meaning of life.

02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:35.640
No, the uncertainty, the confusion.

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.880
Because there's a magic to it all.

02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.160
Everything you've talked about,

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.880
from starting from the basic elements with the big bang

02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:45.400
that somehow created the sun,

02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:50.400
that somehow set a few to thermodynamics and created life

02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:52.680
and all the ways that you've talked about,

02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:54.840
from ribosomes that created the machinery

02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.960
that created the machine,

02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:57.680
and then now the biological machine

02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:00.400
creating through digital fabrication,

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.360
more complex artificial machines.

02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.800
All of that, there's a magic to that creative process.

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.480
And we humans are smart enough to notice the magic.

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:13.200
So you haven't said the S word yet.

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:14.040
Which one is that?

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:14.880
Singularity.

02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:19.680
Yeah, I'm not sure if Ray Kurzweil is listening,

02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:20.680
if he is, hi Ray.

02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.200
But I have a complex relationship with Ray

02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:28.200
because a lot of the things he projects I find annoying,

02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:31.720
but then he does his homework

02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:34.520
and then somewhat annoyingly he points out

02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.320
how almost everything I'm doing fits on his roadmaps.

02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:39.160
Yeah.

02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:44.760
And so the question is,

02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:47.520
are we heading towards a singularity?

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:52.960
So I'd have to say I lean towards sigmoids

02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.640
rather than exponentials.

02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:59.000
We've done pretty well with sigmoids.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.440
Yeah, so sigmoids are things grow and they taper,

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:04.800
and then there can be one after it and one after it.

02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:09.800
So I'll pass on whether there's enough of them

02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:13.000
that they diverge.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
But the selfish gene answer to the meaning of life

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:23.840
is the meaning of life is the propagation of life.

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:28.840
And so it was a step for atoms to assemble into a molecule,

02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:34.640
for molecules to assemble into a protocell,

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:38.200
for the protocell to form to then form organelles,

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:43.200
for the cells to form organs, the organs to form an organism.

02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:47.200
Then it was a step for organisms to form family units,

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:49.600
then family units to form villages.

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:52.200
You can view each of those as a stack

02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:53.680
in the level of organizations.

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:58.000
So you can see that there's a whole bunch of things

02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.120
you could view everything we've spoken about

02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:06.520
as the imperative of life,

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:10.120
just the next step in the hierarchy of that,

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:12.600
in the fulfillment of the inexorable drive

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:14.400
of the violation of thermodynamics.

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:18.000
So you could view, I'm an embodiment of the will

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.360
of the violation of thermodynamics speaking.

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:24.800
The two of us having an old chat, yes.

02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.920
Yeah.

02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:27.120
And so it continues.

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:30.040
And even then the singularity is just a transition

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.520
up the ladder.

02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:34.560
There's nothing deeper to consciousness

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:39.560
than it's a derived property of distributed problem solving.

02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:46.360
There's nothing deeper to life than embodied AI

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.440
in morphogenesis.

02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:53.880
So why so much of this conversation in my life

02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:57.240
is involved in these fab labs.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:00.000
And initially it just started as outreach,

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.640
then it started as keeping up with it.

02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:05.640
Then it turned to, it was rewarding.

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:12.840
Then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs

02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.280
in as goes out to them.

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:15.480
It began as outreach,

02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:17.800
but now more knowledge is coming back from the labs

02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:19.400
than is going into them.

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:24.400
And then finally it ends with what I described

02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:27.040
as competing with myself at MIT,

02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:30.880
but a better way to say that is tapping the brain power

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:31.800
of the planet.

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:35.280
And so I guess for me personally,

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:37.560
that's the meaning of my life.

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:39.640
And maybe that's the meaning for the universe too.

02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:43.840
It's using us humans and our creations

02:05:43.840 --> 02:05:46.880
to understand itself in the way it's,

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:51.560
whatever the creative process that created earth

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:53.160
is competing with itself.

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.440
Yeah.

02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:56.360
So you could take morphogenesis

02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:58.120
as a summary of this whole conversation,

02:05:58.120 --> 02:06:00.360
or you could take recursion.

02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:03.400
That in a sense, what we've been talking about

02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:05.520
is recursion all the way down.

02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:08.840
And in the end, I think this whole thing is pretty fun.

02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:12.320
It's short life is, but it's pretty fun.

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.920
And so is this conversation.

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:14.920
I mentioned to you offline,

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:17.280
I'm going through some difficult stuff personally

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:20.560
and your passion for what you do is just really inspiring.

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:23.720
And it just lights up my mood and lights up my heart.

02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:25.320
And you're an inspiration for,

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:28.520
I know thousands of people that work with you at MIT

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:30.160
and millions of people across the world.

02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:31.840
It's a big honor that you sit with me today.

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:32.720
This is really fun.

02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:33.760
This was a pleasure.

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:36.240
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:37.640
with Neil Gershenfeld.

02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:38.880

And now let me leave you with some words

02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:44.960
from Pablo Picasso.

02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:48.240
Every child is an artist.

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:51.400
The challenge is staying an artist when you grow up.

02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:55.640
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
