00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.280
Winning is not enough.

00:06.820 --> 00:10.120
The following is a conversation with Hajar Gracie,

00:10.120 --> 00:12.480
widely considered to be the greatest

00:12.480 --> 00:15.400
Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.360
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.440
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:19.440 --> 00:20.680
in the description.

00:20.680 --> 00:24.320
And now, dear friends, here's Hajar Gracie.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.600
Let's start with possibly the greatest match

00:27.600 --> 00:29.600
in Jiu-Jitsu history, your second match

00:29.600 --> 00:30.960
against Buchecha.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.320
Let's go through the details.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.600
Let's go through the whole thing.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.920
So, the walk leading up to it.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.160
You always do this walk, this epic walk.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.720
You post it on Instagram.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.760
Hanzo posted it on Instagram.

00:41.760 --> 00:44.880
This calm walk towards the mat.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.480
Well, let's go to that match in particular.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.440
What was going through your mind?

00:48.440 --> 00:49.800
You've been away from competition,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.500
facing probably one of the greatest,

00:52.500 --> 00:54.560
and at that time, many people considered

00:54.560 --> 00:57.860
the greatest Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time in Buchecha.

00:58.620 --> 01:01.060
Here's the old man, the old timer,

01:01.060 --> 01:02.480
getting back out there.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.780
What were you thinking?

01:03.780 --> 01:06.820
Yeah, I think that's the first time

01:06.820 --> 01:08.660
since probably I got my black belt

01:08.660 --> 01:10.700
that I wasn't the favorite walk into a fight,

01:10.700 --> 01:11.840
I have to say.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.600
Like a lot of people consider him the favorite.

01:16.260 --> 01:18.380
I mean, understandable.

01:18.380 --> 01:20.020
You know, I was out of competition for a while.

01:20.020 --> 01:21.760
He was just winning everything.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.180
So, you know, saying about the walk,

01:25.180 --> 01:29.180
like for me, you know, the fight starts way before

01:29.180 --> 01:31.020
the referee say go, you know.

01:31.020 --> 01:34.180
It's all the focus and concentration

01:34.180 --> 01:37.380
that I think is very important for me to start before.

01:37.380 --> 01:41.460
Like, you know, I almost walk blind to the mat.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.420
Many times I passed like great friends

01:43.420 --> 01:44.980
and I couldn't see anyone.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.180
You know, they're trying to talk to you.

01:46.180 --> 01:50.020
And I'm like, I'm 100% focused on my opponent already,

01:50.020 --> 01:52.580
even though that I cannot even see him in front of me.

01:52.620 --> 01:55.300
So I think that's for me was always very important

01:55.300 --> 01:59.780
to try to clear my mind out from everything.

01:59.780 --> 02:02.100
Are you visualizing the opponent or are you just clearing?

02:02.100 --> 02:03.940
Not at that time.

02:03.940 --> 02:05.580
Is there, what's in your head?

02:05.580 --> 02:08.500
Is it like a calm river with birds chirping?

02:08.500 --> 02:09.620
It's blank.

02:09.620 --> 02:10.820
Just blank.

02:10.820 --> 02:11.660
Darkness.

02:11.660 --> 02:12.620
Yeah, darkness.

02:12.620 --> 02:13.460
Okay.

02:13.460 --> 02:15.220
And that's what we see in that calmness.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.100
It's just blankness.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.260
How hard is it to achieve that blankness?

02:18.260 --> 02:22.020
It's difficult to say because I think I,

02:22.020 --> 02:25.660
don't remember when I'll say probably as a black belt,

02:25.660 --> 02:28.900
I try to focus like that, not to think.

02:28.900 --> 02:33.100
Because it's probably something you learn is the more

02:33.100 --> 02:35.100
you think, the more nervous you get.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.860
And there's nothing that you're gonna gain by thinking

02:37.860 --> 02:40.300
of the fight or the possibilities, what, you know,

02:40.300 --> 02:42.740
what you can do, what can go wrong, what can go right.

02:42.740 --> 02:44.660
Because it's unpredictable.

02:44.660 --> 02:46.580
You have absolutely no idea.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.100
It's impossible to predict the fight.

02:49.140 --> 02:52.100
And you discover that if you just let those

02:52.100 --> 02:54.580
nervous feelings go and empty your mind,

02:54.580 --> 02:55.900
it actually is pretty effective.

02:55.900 --> 02:56.740
It is.

02:56.740 --> 02:57.860
It makes you feel better.

02:57.860 --> 03:00.340
It's, you know, you kind of control your emotion,

03:00.340 --> 03:03.420
control the adrenaline on your body up to a level.

03:03.420 --> 03:07.500
So it absolutely helps you, you know, focus in the fight.

03:07.500 --> 03:11.100
I've learned that in jiu-jitsu and in general in life,

03:11.100 --> 03:13.860
that whenever something feels really shitty,

03:13.860 --> 03:17.260
you can just like take that thought and not think about it.

03:17.260 --> 03:20.500
Like I do that like on long runs or like a fast run or,

03:20.500 --> 03:22.820
yeah, in jiu-jitsu, especially when I'm getting older,

03:22.820 --> 03:25.340
out of shape, like that feeling of exhaustion.

03:25.340 --> 03:27.420
Well, you can always get to the feeling of exhaustion.

03:27.420 --> 03:29.940
You can just not think about it.

03:29.940 --> 03:32.100
Not think about being exhausted.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.420
Just, and that somehow relaxes you.

03:34.420 --> 03:36.580
I think maybe in the face of exhaustion,

03:36.580 --> 03:38.420
all the fears start to creep in.

03:38.420 --> 03:39.700
Maybe your muscles tighten up.

03:39.700 --> 03:40.540
I don't know.

03:40.540 --> 03:44.420
This is for the amateur jiu-jitsu person.

03:45.300 --> 03:49.020
But it's kind of funny how you can just take that thought

03:49.020 --> 03:50.020
and let go of it.

03:50.020 --> 03:53.100
So you get, as a black belt competitor, you get used to,

03:53.100 --> 03:55.420
you get good at letting go of any thoughts.

03:55.420 --> 03:56.260
Yeah.

03:56.260 --> 03:58.140
When you mention to exhaustion is,

03:58.140 --> 04:00.420
I mean, that's another good example of it.

04:00.420 --> 04:03.020
It's, you know, there's a lot of times in the fight,

04:03.020 --> 04:06.340
you're getting tired and you're getting pretty tired.

04:06.340 --> 04:09.020
So it's like the last thing you want to think of it

04:09.020 --> 04:10.540
is how tired you are.

04:10.540 --> 04:13.300
It doesn't matter because it doesn't.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.940
What are you going to quit?

04:14.940 --> 04:16.620
I mean, it doesn't matter.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.900
It's how tired you are.

04:17.900 --> 04:18.740
It's-

04:18.740 --> 04:19.580
Yeah, there's no value thinking about it.

04:19.580 --> 04:20.420
There's no value.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.780
You just have to go through it.

04:21.780 --> 04:25.740
So when you're like, you know, many minutes into the match

04:25.740 --> 04:29.260
and you're slowly moving, as you sometimes do,

04:29.260 --> 04:30.700
tying your belt, catching your breath,

04:30.700 --> 04:31.660
you're not thinking about anything.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.940
You're trying to let go of thinking.

04:33.940 --> 04:38.900
I'm trying to like to save everything to the fight.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.300
Like nothing goes to waste.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.460
It's, you know, every move unnecessary,

04:44.460 --> 04:46.820
it's just going to make you more tired

04:46.820 --> 04:48.660
or it's going to take something out of you.

04:48.660 --> 04:52.540
Like, you know, I try to calculate every single move I make,

04:52.540 --> 04:54.620
save as much energy as I can.

04:54.620 --> 04:58.980
So I can fully, you know, be focused 100% in the fight

04:58.980 --> 05:01.140
with no waste, especially energy-wise.

05:01.140 --> 05:02.580
And that's instinctual.

05:02.580 --> 05:05.660
Like minimizing the amount of moves.

05:05.660 --> 05:08.260
You're not like explicitly thinking,

05:08.260 --> 05:09.220
should I do this or not?

05:09.220 --> 05:13.540
It's just, don't move unless it's absolutely required.

05:13.540 --> 05:16.900
Yeah, because fight, you cannot really,

05:16.900 --> 05:18.860
there's not really time to think much, you know,

05:18.860 --> 05:20.860
it's like your instincts are playing.

05:20.860 --> 05:25.460
It's like it's, you know, you already have your weapons,

05:25.460 --> 05:27.940
let's say, you know, the things that you do at,

05:27.940 --> 05:31.540
it's just to wait for the perfect moment.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.020
The beauty of it is, you know,

05:33.020 --> 05:34.780
there's the right moment to everything.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.620
If you feel one second too late, doesn't work.

05:37.620 --> 05:38.540
No, it get messy.

05:38.540 --> 05:41.460
So it's, you know, you're trying to catch that moment.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.100
That's just, you know, and for that,

05:44.100 --> 05:46.620
you have to be fully focused in what you're doing

05:46.620 --> 05:50.060
because one second is, you're out, it won't work.

05:50.060 --> 05:52.180
But you're not exactly known as somebody

05:52.180 --> 05:54.180
that moves super quickly.

05:54.180 --> 05:57.900
So the, so the moment,

05:57.900 --> 05:59.500
it's not about how quickly you move,

05:59.500 --> 06:01.940
it's about the right moment.

06:01.940 --> 06:03.260
So you move slowly.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.100
Yeah.

06:04.100 --> 06:07.620
Yeah, it's not like it's speed,

06:07.620 --> 06:10.220
it's not like you have to move at the speed of light.

06:10.220 --> 06:13.180
It's the move itself at that precise moment.

06:13.180 --> 06:15.100
It doesn't have to be super fast

06:15.100 --> 06:17.900
because your opponent's not moving super fast, you know.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.740
So it's a combination of moving between you and him.

06:21.740 --> 06:24.060
I mean, the same thing happens in judo

06:24.060 --> 06:25.620
and the movement can be really small.

06:25.620 --> 06:26.460
Yeah.

06:26.460 --> 06:29.420
I think judo is a bit more explosiveness,

06:29.420 --> 06:32.380
you know, the moves are slightly faster.

06:32.380 --> 06:36.460
So it does require a bit more explosiveness in judo.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.860
But even just the right timing for an off balance.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.340
Just a little tug.

06:42.340 --> 06:43.860
Yeah, it's not that, you know,

06:43.860 --> 06:47.180
moving the speed is not gonna count that much.

06:47.180 --> 06:49.500
It's the timing that you initiate that move.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.740
You see that with foot sweeps.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.620
There's nothing more beautiful than

06:52.620 --> 06:56.900
like Olympic level athletes going at it in the Olympics

06:56.900 --> 06:58.980
and a perfect foot sweep.

06:58.980 --> 07:02.660
And it's just, and you see one man's life

07:02.660 --> 07:04.740
flash before his eyes and realize,

07:04.780 --> 07:08.020
like I'm supposed to be the top three person in the world

07:08.020 --> 07:10.620
that I just find, and they have this look on their face

07:10.620 --> 07:12.420
like I don't know what just happened.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.260
It's beautiful to see.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.660
You don't see that, I guess you see that in boxing,

07:15.660 --> 07:17.060
knockouts and stuff like that.

07:17.060 --> 07:18.500
You don't know what the hell just happened.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.540
Yeah, it's that precise moment of movement

07:22.540 --> 07:23.540
that you get caught.

07:23.540 --> 07:27.900
Like is that one split second, that's it.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.220
Do you get that in jiu-jitsu at all?

07:29.220 --> 07:32.740
Because judo has, because of the explosiveness,

07:32.740 --> 07:34.900
because of the point scoring system

07:34.900 --> 07:37.340
that incentivizes these giant throws,

07:38.540 --> 07:40.140
has these moments where everything

07:40.140 --> 07:41.700
just turns on a single moment.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.700
Do you have that in jiu-jitsu too?

07:42.700 --> 07:45.460
Not really because then it's points.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.540
You get like two points.

07:47.540 --> 07:51.740
So it's, because I think regarding the submission

07:51.740 --> 07:55.900
is not just one precise movement that changes everything.

07:55.900 --> 07:59.780
I think judo is the takedown that counts as a submission.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.340
Like keep on, fight over.

08:01.340 --> 08:03.220
Jiu-jitsu don't have that.

08:03.220 --> 08:05.340
So you will score points.

08:05.340 --> 08:07.940
But I think in terms of submission,

08:07.940 --> 08:12.740
you need to get to a dominant position first

08:12.740 --> 08:15.060
and then the submission will come slowly.

08:15.060 --> 08:15.900
It's a process.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.060
Yeah.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.740
Okay, let's go back to that guy with his mind.

08:19.740 --> 08:21.900
So actually in the weeks leading up to it,

08:21.900 --> 08:24.740
in the days, in the hours, in the minutes,

08:24.740 --> 08:29.260
is there some fear in you leading up to this?

08:30.260 --> 08:33.140
I mean, I'm not going to say that I'm fearless

08:33.140 --> 08:36.820
because everybody fears something, you know?

08:36.820 --> 08:37.660
The fear is there,

08:37.660 --> 08:39.940
but it's like how much you let that control you.

08:39.940 --> 08:43.700
I think I was a lot more confident than fearful,

08:43.700 --> 08:45.460
for sure, walking through that fight.

08:45.460 --> 08:49.620
Like I was pretty confident that I could beat him.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.620
Where's the source of that confidence?

08:52.460 --> 08:56.420
My belief on me is I can take the world.

08:57.260 --> 08:59.340
Not that you can take anyone in the world,

08:59.340 --> 09:02.660
but is there a specific strategic,

09:02.660 --> 09:04.700
like talking to Donaher,

09:05.700 --> 09:08.820
he believes that there's no such thing as confidence.

09:08.820 --> 09:12.660
Or rather, the way you get confidence is through data,

09:13.620 --> 09:16.860
like that you have proven yourself effective

09:18.060 --> 09:19.420
in previous situations.

09:19.420 --> 09:23.700
But with Buxaca, you don't have much data.

09:23.700 --> 09:25.460
It was a very, the first time you faced him

09:25.460 --> 09:27.220
was a very tough,

09:27.220 --> 09:29.820
that was also one of the greatest matches of all time.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.060
It was very tough.

09:31.060 --> 09:33.500
So doesn't that creep in, like that doubt,

09:33.500 --> 09:34.980
because you don't have enough data

09:34.980 --> 09:36.460
to be confident based on.

09:39.300 --> 09:44.300
Yeah, I mean, okay, if I never had fought before,

09:44.940 --> 09:47.740
suddenly walk into a fight with someone like that,

09:47.740 --> 09:49.700
then would I be that confident?

09:49.700 --> 09:52.060
I mean, probably no.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.980
So that history of what we've been doing,

09:55.500 --> 09:57.740
what we've been achieving does give you confidence.

09:57.740 --> 10:00.020
If that was my first fight ever,

10:00.020 --> 10:02.140
I wouldn't, probably I wouldn't be that confident.

10:02.140 --> 10:03.380
But the time off?

10:04.460 --> 10:05.500
It doesn't matter.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.340
Doesn't matter.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.900
Doesn't matter.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.100
You don't have the fear or the actual physical experience,

10:11.100 --> 10:13.740
the psychological experience of being rusty,

10:13.740 --> 10:14.580
of being out of the competition.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.180
That will come on, on training.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.580
So you, okay, so you simulate some aspect of that.

10:19.580 --> 10:22.860
Yeah, I mean, the training will tell you how you are.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.780
Did you increase the intensity of the training

10:25.780 --> 10:26.980
leading up to this?

10:26.980 --> 10:29.300
Yeah, I mean, I trained normal.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.220
Let's say compared to the first fight,

10:31.220 --> 10:32.900
the second one's a lot more confidence,

10:32.900 --> 10:35.100
because like I said on training,

10:35.100 --> 10:38.340
the training for the first fight, it was terrible.

10:39.460 --> 10:40.300
So.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.620
What do you mean?

10:41.620 --> 10:44.700
I think I was focusing MMA for a while,

10:44.700 --> 10:45.540
for a couple of months,

10:45.540 --> 10:47.460
and I wasn't really focusing the gear.

10:47.460 --> 10:50.540
By the time I accept the fight and start training,

10:50.580 --> 10:53.460
like all my responses on training were off.

10:53.460 --> 10:56.340
Like all my training partners that I used to train with

10:56.340 --> 10:58.060
that I destroyed.

10:58.060 --> 11:00.820
I mean, now they're like, they're beating me.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.220
You know, it's like I cannot beat them

11:02.220 --> 11:04.980
the way I was used to.

11:04.980 --> 11:08.220
But, you know, so I knew something was not right

11:08.220 --> 11:09.860
for the first fight.

11:09.860 --> 11:12.660
But then it's, you know, no points.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.740
It's submission or draw.

11:14.740 --> 11:15.580
So.

11:15.580 --> 11:16.400
Yeah, for people who don't know,

11:16.400 --> 11:18.820
it was in Martin Morris, which is a 20 minute match,

11:18.820 --> 11:20.580
submission only, so there's no,

11:20.580 --> 11:22.140
the winner's determined only by submission,

11:22.140 --> 11:23.580
otherwise it's a draw.

11:23.580 --> 11:27.500
So physically I wasn't myself on that fight.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.500
I was tired, you know, my body wasn't responding.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.100
Anyway, so the confidence was different

11:33.100 --> 11:34.140
from the first, the second.

11:34.140 --> 11:35.980
I think I was confident enough

11:35.980 --> 11:38.220
that I wouldn't get tapped out on the first,

11:38.220 --> 11:39.940
that I was still gonna fight,

11:39.940 --> 11:42.380
because he has to tap me out to beat me.

11:42.380 --> 11:44.180
And I trust on my defense.

11:44.180 --> 11:45.780
I'm confident enough on my defense

11:45.780 --> 11:47.740
that he will not tap me out.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.460
But in terms of winning, you know,

11:51.460 --> 11:53.260
walking to the second fight,

11:53.260 --> 11:55.900
I was a lot more confident.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.180
What can you say about that feeling

11:57.180 --> 11:58.980
when something's not right?

11:58.980 --> 12:00.300
Isn't that a thing that breaks people?

12:00.300 --> 12:01.380
It's weird breaks.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.820
It's weird, like people crack, they give up.

12:03.820 --> 12:07.260
You know, it's a big test,

12:07.260 --> 12:10.620
because it's like being really tired.

12:10.620 --> 12:11.620
It's the same thing.

12:11.620 --> 12:13.100
It's like a lot of people crack

12:13.100 --> 12:15.780
because they just feel they cannot give it more.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.940
They have nothing more to give.

12:17.940 --> 12:19.740
So they just like give up.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.060
It's too hard.

12:21.060 --> 12:21.900
So what do you do?

12:21.900 --> 12:23.900
Just again, take the thoughts out.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.700
There is no giving up.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.660
I mean, I don't mind.

12:27.660 --> 12:28.740
I don't care.

12:28.740 --> 12:31.460
Like just giving up is not enough.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.300
It's not.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.780
That's always the way you thought?

12:33.780 --> 12:34.620
Yeah.

12:34.620 --> 12:35.460
About Jiu Jitsu?

12:35.460 --> 12:36.300
Yeah.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.500
I never gave up.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.620
I mean, I tapped.

12:38.620 --> 12:41.460
It's, you know, not giving up is not tapping.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.340
That's just stupid.

12:43.340 --> 12:44.900
Especially, you know, doing training.

12:45.420 --> 12:46.500
I get caught, I tap.

12:46.500 --> 12:51.100
I've never ever hurt myself by not tapping.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.380
Again, you get angry, you know, train hard,

12:54.380 --> 12:56.540
improve, make yourself better.

12:56.540 --> 12:57.380
You got caught.

12:57.380 --> 12:59.540
Accept that you made a mistake,

12:59.540 --> 13:02.620
give up, tap, then try harder.

13:02.620 --> 13:04.860
So, you know, not tapping,

13:04.860 --> 13:07.100
it's you sacrificing your body

13:07.100 --> 13:09.300
and you will never be the same.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.180
Like if you let your elbow popped,

13:11.180 --> 13:13.940
the elbow will never ever be the same, ever.

13:13.980 --> 13:15.900
You let yourself go to sleep,

13:15.900 --> 13:17.540
your resistance drops.

13:17.540 --> 13:21.060
So, everybody has a limit of resistance

13:21.060 --> 13:23.500
until they, you know, to resist the choke

13:23.500 --> 13:25.140
before you pass out.

13:25.140 --> 13:28.460
The moment that you go to sleep,

13:28.460 --> 13:30.580
that resistance will drop.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.420
According to-

13:31.420 --> 13:32.380
I've never heard anyone say that.

13:32.380 --> 13:33.220
That's awesome.

13:33.220 --> 13:34.060
That's true.

13:34.060 --> 13:34.900
So, tap.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.720
So, that's the reason,

13:35.720 --> 13:36.940
because people usually say it's-

13:36.940 --> 13:39.580
No, it's the same way you get knocked out.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.220
You get knocked out the first time,

13:41.220 --> 13:42.500
your resistance dropped.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.300
Your jaw gets weaker.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.140
So-

13:45.140 --> 13:45.960
Just for the record,

13:45.960 --> 13:48.180
I've never gone to sleep in jiu-jitsu,

13:48.180 --> 13:50.460
which means my resistance is high, right?

13:50.460 --> 13:51.300
I don't know.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.140
Yeah, must be.

13:52.140 --> 13:53.980
Or your defense is pretty good.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.380
I don't know about that.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.420
No, I wouldn't.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.420
Because it doesn't make sense to me.

13:59.420 --> 14:01.540
Or maybe, in my case,

14:01.540 --> 14:05.380
I think my understanding of when I'm screwed

14:05.380 --> 14:06.460
is pretty good.

14:06.460 --> 14:07.280
Yeah.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.120
Like, there's no-

14:08.120 --> 14:08.960
You're not in trouble.

14:08.960 --> 14:09.800
Yeah.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.180
One of the things I regret the most

14:12.180 --> 14:13.620
about my jiu-jitsu journey

14:13.620 --> 14:16.620
is not having given enough time

14:16.620 --> 14:20.620
to being in really bad positions.

14:20.620 --> 14:21.860
Like, the better I got,

14:21.860 --> 14:25.400
I think the less I started being in bad positions,

14:25.400 --> 14:26.240
which is terrible.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.340
It's because you spar.

14:27.340 --> 14:29.440
That's how you train.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.280
Yeah.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.540
Because you used to just spar.

14:32.540 --> 14:33.380
When you spar,

14:33.380 --> 14:36.900
like, it's difficult to be in bad positions a lot.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.520
You train with better people,

14:38.520 --> 14:41.660
but, I mean, let's say five, six-minute rows.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.540
How long you're going to be in a really bad position?

14:43.540 --> 14:44.380
Not long, right?

14:44.380 --> 14:46.940
So you don't really have time to develop.

14:46.940 --> 14:51.940
That's why people, they don't train being in bad positions

14:52.180 --> 14:55.140
because you have to start there over and over again

14:56.180 --> 14:57.460
to be used to it.

14:57.460 --> 14:58.620
Yeah, or put yourself there.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.780
I just didn't have that mindset, I think.

15:00.780 --> 15:02.340
I think you start, I mean,

15:02.340 --> 15:03.740
part of the fun of jiu-jitsu is,

15:03.740 --> 15:05.100
as you get better and better,

15:05.100 --> 15:06.460
you have certain people you go with,

15:06.460 --> 15:08.380
you have these puzzles that you've figured out,

15:08.380 --> 15:11.220
that you're playing very specific details,

15:11.740 --> 15:12.580
you're working out,

15:12.580 --> 15:16.140
you're trying to improve your main techniques and so on.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.500
But yeah, just the percentage of time you spend

15:18.500 --> 15:20.740
being submitted or being,

15:20.740 --> 15:23.060
even going against lower ranks,

15:23.060 --> 15:25.420
trying to escape basic submissions is low.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.380
I don't know if that's true for most people.

15:27.380 --> 15:28.540
Probably is, right?

15:28.540 --> 15:30.540
Most people have very bad defense

15:30.540 --> 15:32.380
because they don't allow themselves to be there

15:32.380 --> 15:35.580
because, I mean, who wants to get tapped?

15:35.580 --> 15:36.780
Because you will.

15:36.780 --> 15:39.500
Until you work on your defense,

15:39.500 --> 15:41.780
of course you're going to get tapped.

15:41.780 --> 15:42.620
You're not going to escape,

15:42.620 --> 15:44.460
you're going to struggle to escape.

15:44.460 --> 15:47.300
So people, they don't want to be there.

15:48.540 --> 15:51.740
I regret it most because of the effect

15:51.740 --> 15:54.020
it clearly had on how I competed.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.820
It was clear that my competition

15:57.820 --> 16:02.380
was constantly driven by conservative thinking.

16:02.380 --> 16:04.340
Like, don't take risks.

16:04.340 --> 16:07.420
I think because of a weak defense, honestly.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.980
And I think a lot of any of the fear,

16:10.980 --> 16:14.740
like, for example, exhaustion was accompanied by fear

16:14.740 --> 16:16.740
because of weak defense, I think.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.580
If I were to psychoanalyze myself,

16:18.580 --> 16:20.900
and I regretted it, I regretted it a lot.

16:22.740 --> 16:25.420
But speaking of which,

16:27.060 --> 16:29.980
I don't think anyone's ever submitted you in competition.

16:29.980 --> 16:30.820
So you're-

16:32.060 --> 16:33.780
Well, I was a juvenile, yes.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.940
Yes, so when you were a young person.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.700
Does that still haunt you?

16:39.700 --> 16:44.700
No, first I was winning that fight, by a large.

16:45.540 --> 16:48.220
I mean, I think by six points or four or something like that.

16:48.220 --> 16:49.060
But I was like, I was-

16:49.060 --> 16:50.460
You still remember it though, huh?

16:50.460 --> 16:51.580
By the details.

16:51.580 --> 16:52.420
Yeah.

16:56.900 --> 16:57.740
Yeah.

16:57.740 --> 16:58.820
You ever beat him again?

16:58.820 --> 17:00.140
He never competed again.

17:00.140 --> 17:00.980
I know.

17:00.980 --> 17:01.820
I know.

17:05.220 --> 17:07.740
Whoever you are, please, let's do a podcast again.

17:07.740 --> 17:10.260
We'll talk shit about Hajar the whole time.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.100
No, but what do you attribute to that too?

17:12.100 --> 17:13.820
You're saying you're confident,

17:13.820 --> 17:17.300
you're confident that the top of the world,

17:17.300 --> 17:20.460
the number one buchesha would not submit you.

17:21.580 --> 17:23.140
So where's that confidence grounded,

17:23.140 --> 17:25.180
and what do you attribute the fact

17:25.180 --> 17:26.940
that nobody was able to submit you?

17:27.940 --> 17:30.140
First, it comes on training.

17:30.140 --> 17:33.500
I train a lot, bad position.

17:33.500 --> 17:37.820
Like my defense is good because I practice over and over again.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.740
As much as I practice all my offensive position.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.580
So it's, you have to train both equally.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.340
It's not just being in a good position,

17:46.340 --> 17:48.020
you have to be in bad.

17:48.020 --> 17:51.140
So I think that's a very strong part of my game.

17:51.140 --> 17:54.580
You know, to be a complete fighter,

17:54.700 --> 17:57.460
you know, a complete martial artist,

17:57.460 --> 18:00.460
you have to be good in every single position.

18:00.460 --> 18:01.780
Every single one.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.420
Those that you're not, you have a weakness.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.060
So it's, you know, to be complete,

18:06.060 --> 18:07.860
you should have no weakness.

18:07.860 --> 18:10.300
So that was always my, you know,

18:10.300 --> 18:13.460
I was always very particular on that.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.660
Like it's where my weakness,

18:15.660 --> 18:17.580
where I don't feel good at it.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.260
If you put me in a position where I struggle,

18:19.260 --> 18:20.820
how do I escape, how do I get out?

18:20.860 --> 18:21.700
Everything.

18:21.700 --> 18:25.820
Any submission locked, penny position, you know,

18:25.820 --> 18:27.420
back mount, everything.

18:27.420 --> 18:30.100
It doesn't matter which position I have.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.980
I practice over and over again.

18:31.980 --> 18:36.380
So that when I, if I get there in a fighting situation,

18:36.380 --> 18:37.460
I will know how to get out.

18:37.460 --> 18:39.580
At least I'll have a direction.

18:39.580 --> 18:41.620
You know, I will know this is my way out.

18:42.620 --> 18:45.540
Do you practice both escaping the bad position

18:45.540 --> 18:50.420
and the transition into the bad position,

18:51.020 --> 18:51.940
avoiding it?

18:51.940 --> 18:53.340
Because that's how it happens.

18:53.340 --> 18:57.380
You know, Jiu-Jitsu, you start in a neutral position.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.700
No, the transition then becomes the fight itself.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.940
You see, being there is most important.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.780
It's when you're there,

19:04.780 --> 19:06.980
then you have to know how to get out.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.020
That's your weakness.

19:08.020 --> 19:11.300
How, you know, stopping the person getting there

19:11.300 --> 19:12.140
is something different.

19:12.140 --> 19:13.500
So there are two different things.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.060
It's either you practice one or the other.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.860
So both are important, I guess.

19:18.860 --> 19:21.620
But the stopping the person is easier to practice

19:21.620 --> 19:24.060
because that comes naturally in training.

19:24.060 --> 19:25.940
What was the actual process?

19:25.940 --> 19:28.700
Like, what was your biggest weakness throughout your,

19:28.700 --> 19:31.900
like just remembering what was annoying to you

19:31.900 --> 19:33.260
to figure out?

19:33.260 --> 19:35.700
I mean, now, side control is always-

19:35.700 --> 19:36.540
Bottom of side control.

19:36.540 --> 19:37.580
Bottom.

19:37.580 --> 19:41.100
Regardless how much you practice, it's not ever easy.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.860
You'll never be easy.

19:42.860 --> 19:43.700
But-

19:43.700 --> 19:44.540
It's so annoying.

19:44.540 --> 19:45.740
It makes no sense.

19:45.740 --> 19:47.060
Yeah, someone pins you down.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.220
Jiu-Jitsu doesn't want to move much.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.500
It's a big and strong guy,

19:49.500 --> 19:51.980
regardless of who, it's not gonna be easy to escape.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.380
So some situations are just hard.

19:54.380 --> 19:56.340
That must be the, sorry to interrupt.

19:56.340 --> 19:59.860
I'm interrupting Hajji Gracey, he's discussing Jiu-Jitsu.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.820
But you just made me realize,

20:03.060 --> 20:04.980
if you're really good,

20:04.980 --> 20:06.620
if you're going against, like,

20:06.620 --> 20:09.740
the perfect Jiu-Jitsu competitor,

20:09.740 --> 20:12.940
probably side control might be one of the hardest positions.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.500
Is it the hardest position to escape?

20:14.500 --> 20:15.500
It is one of them.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.100
If the person doesn't want to progress,

20:17.100 --> 20:19.860
it's just concerned about all pinning.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.500
Like the best pinners in the world,

20:21.500 --> 20:24.140
I mean, partially because I've just seen judo people

20:24.140 --> 20:25.220
that know how to pin.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.060
Yeah.

20:26.060 --> 20:26.900
They-

20:26.900 --> 20:29.260
Go skip their side control, it's a nightmare.

20:29.260 --> 20:30.100
It's a nightmare.

20:30.100 --> 20:34.220
Doesn't matter how much you practice, it's a nightmare.

20:34.220 --> 20:35.900
And it's also just frustrating.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.060
I think, I guess it is also frustrating

20:39.060 --> 20:41.140
because a lot of people in that position

20:41.140 --> 20:44.460
will be about maintaining control, not progressing.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.900
And usually people, when they're a mount and a back control,

20:46.900 --> 20:50.340
are usually trying to progress towards a submission,

20:50.340 --> 20:52.540
which opens up opportunities for escape.

20:53.540 --> 20:55.820
So what's the actual process

20:55.820 --> 20:58.540
of just time and time again,

20:58.540 --> 21:00.860
putting yourself on bottom side control?

21:00.860 --> 21:01.700
Yeah.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.580
Over and over again, starting there, escape, get back,

21:04.580 --> 21:06.420
escape, get back.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.340
If it mount you, get back.

21:08.340 --> 21:09.780
Any situation outside that,

21:09.780 --> 21:12.060
stop, start again, stop, start again.

21:12.100 --> 21:15.620
And it has to be, I'll say, five minutes

21:15.620 --> 21:18.140
because it's the repetition that will teach you.

21:18.140 --> 21:20.380
If you train like three minutes on top,

21:20.380 --> 21:24.060
you have time to one thing and then time out.

21:24.060 --> 21:26.700
It's the repetition there over and over again.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.580
When you try the same move over and over again,

21:28.580 --> 21:30.860
then you'll see what can go wrong.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.220
And is it understanding the details of the movement

21:34.220 --> 21:36.740
or actually doing the movement and feeling it?

21:36.740 --> 21:37.980
It's both.

21:37.980 --> 21:40.820
First you have to understand the movement and then practice.

21:42.220 --> 21:47.220
But most important thing is defense.

21:47.220 --> 21:52.220
Escape coming second because he's attacking you.

21:52.220 --> 21:54.060
The one thing is if he's not trying to submit you,

21:54.060 --> 21:55.140
but the other one, if it is,

21:55.140 --> 21:57.060
let's say if the person is very good,

21:57.060 --> 22:01.420
has a very good attack, the first thing is defense,

22:01.420 --> 22:03.500
not just escape and expose yourself

22:03.500 --> 22:08.140
to an even worse position because that is very risky.

22:08.140 --> 22:09.100
When you're trying to escape,

22:09.100 --> 22:12.140
you'll always expose yourself to a worse position.

22:12.140 --> 22:16.340
So avoiding that, first is defense, not getting caught.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.740
And then when you're escaping,

22:18.740 --> 22:20.580
don't be in a worse position than you are.

22:20.580 --> 22:23.780
So defense in Jiu-Jitsu when you're wearing a gi,

22:23.780 --> 22:25.060
what does defense entail?

22:25.060 --> 22:26.420
Is it mostly grips?

22:26.420 --> 22:29.460
Is it mostly the positioning of your hips and legs?

22:29.460 --> 22:31.420
It's everything together

22:31.420 --> 22:32.900
because it's a whole body movement.

22:32.900 --> 22:36.780
It's a constantly moving of your arms, legs, body.

22:36.780 --> 22:41.460
It's, they have to, everything works together.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.020
Going back to the mind of that guy,

22:46.060 --> 22:50.260
so confident, no fear at this point.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.300
Is there a bit of ego in there too?

22:53.300 --> 22:58.100
Yes, like I say, no, I'm not gonna say I'm fearless.

22:58.100 --> 23:02.620
Of course this concerns, that fight,

23:02.620 --> 23:04.740
I would have to say was probably the fight

23:04.780 --> 23:07.580
that I got nervous the most walking in

23:07.580 --> 23:11.140
because I knew what that meant, that fight.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.420
They mean everything for me.

23:13.420 --> 23:16.420
All my legacy was on the line

23:16.420 --> 23:19.100
because if I had lost that fight,

23:19.100 --> 23:21.020
forever I would be number two.

23:21.020 --> 23:22.540
Yeah. Forever.

23:22.540 --> 23:27.540
And I mean, Boshieche is a great guy, great competitor.

23:27.980 --> 23:31.340
Jiu-Jitsu is very good, but I'm better than him.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.740
I knew that.

23:32.740 --> 23:34.660
But he's competing nonstop at that point.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.180
He's a great competitor, taking nothing out of him.

23:38.180 --> 23:41.820
He's super tough, very, very tough, very good.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.780
He's probably the best competitor in Jiu-Jitsu.

23:44.780 --> 23:46.980
He won 13 times the World Championship.

23:46.980 --> 23:48.220
I won 10.

23:48.220 --> 23:52.220
So as a competitor, he has more titles than I do.

23:53.740 --> 23:56.980
But in terms of analyzing the game,

23:56.980 --> 23:59.740
I consider technically better than him.

24:00.660 --> 24:04.300
So knowing all that, everything that I build,

24:04.940 --> 24:07.540
all my legacy, it's if I lose.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.100
All riding on this match.

24:09.100 --> 24:12.340
If I lose this fight, I'm forever number two.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.820
And none of that is going through your mind?

24:15.820 --> 24:16.660
No, I knew.

24:16.660 --> 24:18.660
I mean, it's not at that moment.

24:18.660 --> 24:20.820
I already knew that.

24:20.820 --> 24:23.700
I remember just before the curtains open,

24:23.700 --> 24:26.420
I'm standing in before they call my name.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.380
And I mean, my legs were like,

24:29.900 --> 24:32.820
I feel the adrenaline kicking on my legs.

24:32.820 --> 24:35.340
And I'm like, you know, I'm hitting the legs.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.580
I'm like, wake up, you know, get off,

24:37.580 --> 24:40.180
get the adrenaline off me, you know.

24:40.180 --> 24:42.060
So it was intense.

24:42.060 --> 24:43.180
It was intense.

24:43.180 --> 24:44.700
And this was in Rio?

24:44.700 --> 24:45.900
That was in Rio.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.180
So.

24:47.180 --> 24:48.220
My hometown.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.660
So this is, I mean, and you know,

24:50.660 --> 24:55.660
Rio is not exactly known for its calmness in its fans.

24:56.060 --> 24:59.620
So this is like, wherever they hosted the Olympics

25:00.540 --> 25:02.020
the year before.

25:02.060 --> 25:06.700
So this is like, I mean, this, like the whole,

25:06.700 --> 25:10.780
basically martial arts community is watching this.

25:10.780 --> 25:11.620
Watching that fight.

25:11.620 --> 25:13.140
Yeah.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.900
I mean, is there some, was Hanzo there?

25:15.900 --> 25:16.740
Yeah.

25:16.740 --> 25:17.940
Yeah, he was there.

25:17.940 --> 25:20.300
Some people are just, I mean, there's a tension.

25:20.300 --> 25:23.820
It's also, I mean, I don't know if you felt that in part,

25:23.820 --> 25:26.260
but you're also fighting for the Gracie name.

25:26.260 --> 25:27.100
Yeah.

25:28.700 --> 25:29.860
In our hometown.

25:29.860 --> 25:30.700
The greatest.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.220
Where the Gracie really established.

25:32.220 --> 25:37.220
Gracie competitor of all time, arguably in the hometown.

25:37.420 --> 25:38.260
Yeah.

25:38.260 --> 25:39.220
I mean, okay.

25:39.220 --> 25:41.980
All my family, my best friends, my friends,

25:41.980 --> 25:44.180
everybody watching, everybody there.

25:44.180 --> 25:45.940
There was a lot of pressure.

25:45.940 --> 25:46.780
A lot.

25:47.940 --> 25:50.620
And then were you thinking

25:50.620 --> 25:52.460
that you would be able to submit him?

25:52.460 --> 25:54.380
No, it's at that point,

25:54.380 --> 25:56.340
like I don't predict how the fight will go.

25:56.340 --> 25:59.340
That I never did because it is unpredictable.

25:59.860 --> 26:03.620
I never tried to set any strategy for any fight.

26:03.620 --> 26:04.940
I think, oh, okay.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.460
That I did.

26:06.460 --> 26:10.260
But that was the only time that I set any strategy

26:10.260 --> 26:11.180
into a fight.

26:11.180 --> 26:13.780
There was a 15 minutes fight there.

26:13.780 --> 26:17.020
And for, I said, first five minutes,

26:17.020 --> 26:18.500
I'm going to play defense.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.500
He's bigger, stronger, younger.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.700
I don't want to play his game.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.580
And I know he comes in very fast.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.540
Every single fight he had, you know,

26:25.540 --> 26:27.380
he comes very aggressive.

26:27.380 --> 26:29.820
So my strategy walk into the fight,

26:29.820 --> 26:32.300
I say five minutes, I'm going to play defense.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.540
I'm not going to try to attack.

26:33.540 --> 26:36.180
I'm not going to try to match his pace.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.620
I already expected, you know,

26:37.620 --> 26:39.060
maybe I'm going to start losing the fight

26:39.060 --> 26:40.820
because, you know, if he comes in,

26:40.820 --> 26:42.820
there's a risk of me maybe getting takedown,

26:42.820 --> 26:44.900
you know, or something happened.

26:44.900 --> 26:48.620
I'm like, I'm going to stick to the game plan.

26:48.620 --> 26:51.460
Five minutes, I'm going to start picking up the pace

26:51.460 --> 26:52.620
because then it's 10 minutes to go.

26:52.620 --> 26:53.820
Which 10 minutes is a long fight.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.220
So I don't need to start fast,

26:55.220 --> 26:57.060
but I'm going to start being more aggressive.

26:57.060 --> 27:00.420
And then, you know, try to take him down or pull guard,

27:00.420 --> 27:02.060
you know, but by then I'm like,

27:02.060 --> 27:03.740
that's as far as strategy goes.

27:04.700 --> 27:07.300
So no specific stay on the feet.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.380
Were you comfortable being both bottom and top

27:09.380 --> 27:10.700
in this strategic?

27:10.700 --> 27:12.860
Yeah, I'm always comfortable being bottom and top.

27:12.860 --> 27:17.860
I prefer to be on top because being in the bottom,

27:18.140 --> 27:20.380
the person on top dictates the pace of the fight

27:20.380 --> 27:22.140
because he's on top over you.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.900
So I always prefer to be on top

27:23.900 --> 27:25.380
because I can dictate the pace.

27:25.420 --> 27:27.780
I can implement my own pace

27:27.780 --> 27:30.780
and being the bottom, they can slow me down.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.220
So it's harder.

27:32.220 --> 27:36.140
So if I can choose, I will always be on top.

27:36.140 --> 27:38.260
But I think by then I was like,

27:38.260 --> 27:41.020
it's, you know, five minutes hit it.

27:41.020 --> 27:42.980
I'm like, he's pretty big and strong.

27:42.980 --> 27:45.740
I'm going to spend a lot of energy taking him down.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.220
I pull guard.

27:47.220 --> 27:49.260
How did it feel?

27:49.260 --> 27:51.980
So here you're stepping in, by the way, puzzle math.

27:51.980 --> 27:54.300
This is old school, as old school as it gets.

27:56.380 --> 27:58.860
So calm and relaxed here for people just listening.

27:58.860 --> 28:01.700
We're watching the early minutes of the match.

28:01.700 --> 28:02.740
So just feeling it out.

28:02.740 --> 28:03.860
He seems pretty calm too.

28:03.860 --> 28:05.180
He must be nervous too.

28:05.180 --> 28:06.660
I wonder how, did you ever talk to him?

28:06.660 --> 28:07.500
You guys are friends.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.060
Yeah, yeah, we're friends.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.820
Did he ever say how nervous he was?

28:10.820 --> 28:13.220
No, we never spoke about that fight.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.060
No?

28:14.060 --> 28:14.900
No.

28:17.780 --> 28:21.380
He probably lays late at night thinking about it.

28:21.380 --> 28:22.860
Maybe, I don't know.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.300
That SOB.

28:24.300 --> 28:25.140
Yeah.

28:25.860 --> 28:26.820
So you'll see the first five minutes,

28:26.820 --> 28:30.260
no, he kept, I knew what he was going to do

28:30.260 --> 28:31.900
and I studied his game.

28:31.900 --> 28:36.900
His standup is most basic, is basic in takedowns,

28:38.380 --> 28:40.260
leg attacks, double leg.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.260
So he goes single or double and he charges in.

28:43.260 --> 28:46.340
That is pretty much his standup game.

28:46.340 --> 28:48.820
So you were trying, you get a grip.

28:48.820 --> 28:50.740
Yeah, but we got penalized.

28:51.740 --> 28:54.540
So do you like to use the,

28:54.540 --> 28:56.460
do you like to post with your left?

28:56.460 --> 28:58.060
You have a right foot forward usually.

28:58.060 --> 28:59.300
You're a righty, right?

28:59.300 --> 29:01.900
I'm righty, but I know he wants my leg.

29:01.900 --> 29:06.020
So I'm playing my stance just because of his game.

29:06.020 --> 29:08.020
Oh, you know, all my grips at that,

29:08.020 --> 29:10.140
the first five minutes was to kind of try

29:10.140 --> 29:12.180
to neutralize his attacks.

29:12.180 --> 29:13.580
So he wants to get your left leg.

29:13.580 --> 29:14.420
Yeah.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.500
Yeah, right there.

29:17.500 --> 29:18.340
Yeah.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.220
So how hard is that to stop that?

29:20.700 --> 29:22.460
I mean, he felt pretty strong coming in.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.940
So I'm, you know, pushing the head down,

29:24.940 --> 29:26.540
trying to play with his balance.

29:27.420 --> 29:28.540
Yeah.

29:28.540 --> 29:31.340
If you see it, there was a pause.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.660
Go back there.

29:33.660 --> 29:34.780
He charged in.

29:35.780 --> 29:38.740
There's a pause, me standing in front of him.

29:38.740 --> 29:39.580
Yeah.

29:39.580 --> 29:40.420
I did that on purpose.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.060
What do you mean?

29:43.060 --> 29:46.860
Just in front of him, because, you know, he tried

29:46.860 --> 29:48.980
and I'm like, you fail, I'm here.

29:50.380 --> 29:51.940
There's a...

29:51.940 --> 29:53.020
Okay.

29:53.020 --> 29:55.220
So you could feel the frustration.

29:55.220 --> 29:59.500
I could feel his frustration not be able to take me down.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.300
Okay.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.900
So now, and this is just psychological battles.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.540
And you see me walking straight into the middle of the mat

30:06.540 --> 30:08.340
and he's circling out.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.180
Yeah.

30:09.180 --> 30:11.780
See, I'm going very slow, I'm recovering.

30:11.780 --> 30:13.620
And he's computing like shit.

30:13.620 --> 30:14.460
Yeah.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.940
Because he just made an effort trying to take me down.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.700
He needs to recover.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.980
And I mean, you need to recover.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.700
The other guys there are waiting for you.

30:22.700 --> 30:23.780
Yeah.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.580
And do I go for another take down?

30:26.580 --> 30:28.300
Because this one failed.

30:28.300 --> 30:29.140
Yeah.

30:29.140 --> 30:30.660
Do I need to recalculate the strategy?

30:30.660 --> 30:32.940
Yeah, and he kept trying over and over again

30:32.940 --> 30:34.780
and keep failing.

30:34.780 --> 30:37.660
I think that frustrated him a lot on that fight.

30:37.660 --> 30:38.500
I fell.

30:39.980 --> 30:42.460
I felt him kind of slowing down suddenly

30:42.460 --> 30:44.020
because he was getting nowhere.

30:44.980 --> 30:47.100
So we're five minutes in.

30:47.100 --> 30:51.620
Yeah, he keeps, so he never got that take down in the early.

30:51.620 --> 30:52.460
No.

30:57.060 --> 30:58.220
Let's see.

30:58.220 --> 30:59.620
So at this point, do you pull guard?

30:59.620 --> 31:00.460
Yeah, okay.

31:00.460 --> 31:05.460
So that's when I felt like he's mentally he's not,

31:09.220 --> 31:10.220
he's worried now.

31:10.220 --> 31:11.660
Did you try to pull close guard here?

31:11.660 --> 31:13.460
No, I knew he was going to pull guard.

31:13.620 --> 31:16.060
No, I knew he was going to bring Danny in.

31:16.060 --> 31:16.900
Okay.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.820
Because that's the defense against pulling close guard.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.780
Yeah, but I like that.

31:22.420 --> 31:26.300
I like people bringing Danny between my legs

31:26.300 --> 31:28.380
because see, I'm going to close my guard

31:28.380 --> 31:30.140
even with his leg in.

31:30.140 --> 31:35.140
Okay, he's stopping the, well, this is awkward, but I guess.

31:36.100 --> 31:37.220
I was holding his arm.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.060
That's why he fell.

31:38.060 --> 31:39.420
He had no hand to post.

31:39.420 --> 31:40.660
Got it.

31:40.660 --> 31:43.220
But still it puts a leg in.

31:43.980 --> 31:45.180
So you're able to close your guard around.

31:45.180 --> 31:46.580
Is he okay with that?

31:46.580 --> 31:47.580
I do that really well.

31:47.580 --> 31:49.300
I sweep people from that position a lot.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.620
What's the sweep?

31:50.620 --> 31:52.500
I just pushed.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.340
Okay.

31:53.340 --> 31:54.180
It's just a push.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.000
Like to your left side.

31:55.000 --> 31:55.840
Yeah.

31:55.840 --> 31:56.680
Okay.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.500
Because he has no, oh, it's almost like a,

31:58.500 --> 32:01.020
you mean you're basically around his back a little bit.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.900
And he knew that, like I swept a lot of people

32:03.900 --> 32:04.740
with that sweep.

32:04.740 --> 32:09.660
So you see he kept leaning to his left, to my right.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.860
So I want to push them to my left.

32:11.860 --> 32:14.460
So you see him leaning over to my right a lot.

32:14.460 --> 32:16.620
What's the right answer for him to like roll or something?

32:16.620 --> 32:17.740
No, I mean, he's stuck.

32:17.740 --> 32:20.500
He does not really, he's stuck there.

32:20.500 --> 32:24.580
But the one thing he did, he kept off me completely.

32:24.580 --> 32:26.180
See that he's leaning too,

32:26.180 --> 32:28.820
like he's too afraid of my attack now

32:28.820 --> 32:31.580
because he should lean on me.

32:31.580 --> 32:32.420
Yep.

32:32.420 --> 32:34.500
You should bring the fight to me.

32:34.500 --> 32:38.500
So when I fell him, I knew he was like,

32:38.500 --> 32:41.260
he's too worried about my attacks now.

32:41.420 --> 32:42.260
That's right.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.060
So he can't, if he comes back to the center, he has no-

32:45.060 --> 32:46.740
So he's not engaging now at that time.

32:46.740 --> 32:49.260
He's a hundred percent just defending.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.100
So I felt that.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.900
I'm like, he doesn't want to engage.

32:54.860 --> 32:58.260
And he's looking, I knew at that point he wants my foot

32:58.260 --> 33:01.220
because our first fight, I had the exact the same position.

33:01.220 --> 33:04.500
I wasn't holding his arm and he went to attack my foot,

33:04.500 --> 33:05.340
which he did.

33:05.340 --> 33:06.180
He got into attack.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.020
Like a toe hold or what?

33:07.020 --> 33:07.840
Okay.

33:07.840 --> 33:08.680
Yeah.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.460
So I knew he's looking at my foot.

33:10.460 --> 33:11.300
Which foot?

33:11.300 --> 33:12.120
Sorry.

33:12.120 --> 33:12.960
The left, your right foot?

33:12.960 --> 33:14.460
Yeah, my right foot.

33:14.460 --> 33:15.620
Okay.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.460
And so how are you defending?

33:16.460 --> 33:17.300
You're hiding it?

33:17.300 --> 33:18.700
I'm holding his arm.

33:18.700 --> 33:19.900
And now you're going to the back

33:19.900 --> 33:21.260
as an arm drag type of thing.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.540
So the moment that I came off,

33:23.540 --> 33:26.980
now I'm holding his arm so he cannot come up.

33:26.980 --> 33:29.140
So, you know, I'm holding his left arm

33:29.140 --> 33:31.860
so he cannot post a hand on the floor and come up.

33:31.860 --> 33:34.020
And he's holding your right to try to get you-

33:34.020 --> 33:35.500
Yeah.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.940
Basically to prevent you from attacking.

33:37.940 --> 33:38.780
Yeah.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.900
Oh, that's an interesting, and he rolls.

33:41.900 --> 33:42.740
Yeah.

33:42.740 --> 33:45.420
He tried to, he tried to get me off balance.

33:45.420 --> 33:46.760
So see, now I'm switching,

33:46.760 --> 33:48.500
I switched the grip on his arm

33:48.500 --> 33:50.820
so I can free my left arm.

33:51.700 --> 33:52.540
Can I ask you a question?

33:52.540 --> 33:56.980
Like, was there a chance he sweeps you here?

33:56.980 --> 33:58.340
I mean, there's always a chance, but very-

33:58.340 --> 33:59.180
Like that?

33:59.180 --> 34:01.460
Yeah, but see, my left arm is free.

34:01.460 --> 34:02.380
Oh, so you can post.

34:02.380 --> 34:03.620
Yeah.

34:03.620 --> 34:04.700
Why was your left arm free?

34:04.700 --> 34:07.260
Oh, cause you were using it to, got it, got it.

34:07.260 --> 34:08.100
Okay.

34:09.620 --> 34:10.500
I tried the hook.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.180
Now you will see-

34:13.100 --> 34:14.260
Still got your arm.

34:14.260 --> 34:18.860
Yeah, but when I knew he's panicking

34:18.860 --> 34:21.100
because he didn't move,

34:21.100 --> 34:23.020
that he completely opened himself up.

34:23.020 --> 34:25.900
Like I'm holding his left arm.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.780
So by holding their arm,

34:27.780 --> 34:31.420
that prevents him from defending the hook on that side

34:31.420 --> 34:33.700
because his arm is being held across.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.220
So their arm cannot block the hook.

34:36.220 --> 34:38.100
And I mean-

34:38.580 --> 34:39.700
The hook with your left leg?

34:39.700 --> 34:40.740
Yeah.

34:40.740 --> 34:41.980
So you'll see when he come up,

34:41.980 --> 34:43.900
but I would say, I mean, that's my guess,

34:43.900 --> 34:47.260
but Bousheche is, he's a big guy.

34:47.260 --> 34:51.020
He was like 110 kilos, 112, something like that.

34:51.020 --> 34:51.860
Which is-

34:51.860 --> 34:52.700
245.

34:52.700 --> 34:53.740
Yeah, all right.

34:53.740 --> 34:54.860
So-

34:54.860 --> 34:56.660
What were you at the time?

34:56.660 --> 34:57.500
Less?

34:57.500 --> 34:58.820
220, yeah, 220.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.740
A nice slim 100 kilo, okay.

35:02.740 --> 35:03.620
Yeah.

35:03.620 --> 35:04.460
So,

35:07.260 --> 35:09.740
his defense are not amazing.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.020
He's good, but you know,

35:11.020 --> 35:12.860
he's not known to have amazing defense.

35:12.860 --> 35:16.340
So by being the big guy in the room when you train,

35:16.340 --> 35:19.500
you're used to get out of situation because of your size.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.220
You shake people off.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.900
You know, it's because of your size, you shake them off.

35:23.900 --> 35:25.980
You get off some bad positions.

35:25.980 --> 35:26.940
You can-

35:26.940 --> 35:28.540
I mean, I could feel on the first fight,

35:28.540 --> 35:30.020
I'm side control.

35:30.020 --> 35:32.300
You know, suddenly he explode out.

35:32.300 --> 35:35.740
So, you know, I've seen him doing that a few of his fights.

35:35.740 --> 35:40.620
Not in the most technical way, just I'm getting out.

35:40.620 --> 35:42.740
And he did it because of his size.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.340
So, and he did the same thing.

35:44.340 --> 35:47.700
Like he tried to stood up when I'm on his back.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.180
He completely opened up the hooks.

35:50.180 --> 35:52.900
He will see the next move, his head gonna come up

35:52.900 --> 35:54.740
and he gonna try to get off the floor.

35:54.740 --> 35:57.620
So basically come up, shake you off kind of strategy.

35:57.620 --> 35:58.820
There was no difference for the hooks.

35:58.820 --> 36:01.380
I put both hooks in straight away.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.260
Oh, his arm is-

36:03.260 --> 36:04.380
Yeah, I'm off balance.

36:04.380 --> 36:06.500
Yeah, see, I didn't bring him up.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.740
He came up.

36:07.740 --> 36:08.780
Yeah.

36:08.780 --> 36:12.580
And now, I'm attacking his neck

36:12.580 --> 36:14.140
and he's worried about the hooks.

36:15.580 --> 36:17.060
That's fatal mistake.

36:17.060 --> 36:19.820
That's like defense always come first.

36:19.820 --> 36:21.620
Remember what I just said now?

36:21.620 --> 36:23.620
Defense first, cape second.

36:23.620 --> 36:27.100
So he's not worried more about the points than his neck.

36:28.100 --> 36:31.780
So it was like a progression of mistakes.

36:31.780 --> 36:33.980
That's why I think he got frustrated

36:33.980 --> 36:35.820
when he couldn't take me down.

36:35.820 --> 36:38.820
And then when I pull guard, he was frustrated

36:38.820 --> 36:40.820
that the fight wasn't going his way.

36:40.820 --> 36:42.620
He's very good about taking down.

36:42.620 --> 36:44.620
He tried over and over again for five minutes.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.420
And here he was frustrated about the hooks.

36:46.420 --> 36:49.500
So he's like, it's almost like the frustration things like,

36:49.500 --> 36:51.060
no, no, no, these hooks shouldn't be here.

36:51.060 --> 36:53.460
Like I pull guard on the grips that I want.

36:53.460 --> 36:55.220
He's not comfortable inside my guard.

36:55.220 --> 36:56.980
He's not in the position that he wants me to be.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.140
He's over leaning to his left.

37:01.980 --> 37:04.220
He's not engaged, not trying to pass.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.580
He's trying to get the foot, but his arm is trapped.

37:06.580 --> 37:08.380
He's gonna get nowhere.

37:08.380 --> 37:09.980
And then when I swept him,

37:09.980 --> 37:12.820
some of his words start collapsing.

37:12.820 --> 37:13.780
He couldn't take me down.

37:13.780 --> 37:15.420
I pull guard, I'm swept in.

37:15.420 --> 37:17.260
He tried to roll me over.

37:17.260 --> 37:20.140
No, it didn't get me anywhere.

37:20.140 --> 37:22.460
The first movement that he tried to escape,

37:22.460 --> 37:23.460
I'm on his back.

37:24.900 --> 37:25.740
Now he's lost.

37:27.660 --> 37:30.020
If you just go back to him standing up.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.780
See, both hook goes in no difference.

37:33.780 --> 37:36.820
Like there was nothing on the way of those hooks.

37:38.660 --> 37:39.500
Because he tried to come up.

37:39.500 --> 37:43.420
I think as he's coming up, you're high enough on him

37:43.420 --> 37:46.900
to where the weight was just probably immense.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.580
It just felt too heavy.

37:49.580 --> 37:54.260
I mean, you're already going for the choke, of course.

37:55.260 --> 37:56.460
There's no time to lose.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.380
Look at that.

37:59.380 --> 38:01.500
So you're not like worried I'm gonna get shaken off.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.340
You're going for the choke.

38:02.340 --> 38:03.180
No, I'm on his back.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.020
You got your right hand on his lapel.

38:04.020 --> 38:04.860
There's no shaking me off.

38:04.860 --> 38:05.700
I'm on your back now.

38:06.780 --> 38:08.540
We're in this together.

38:08.540 --> 38:11.460
And your right hand is opening up the lapel.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.380
My right hand is holding his arm.

38:13.380 --> 38:14.220
I'm still holding the sleeve.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.460
Oh, sorry.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.620
You're holding the sleeve, but?

38:16.620 --> 38:19.780
I'm holding the sleeve and I'm already going for the neck.

38:19.780 --> 38:21.180
Because it's timing.

38:21.180 --> 38:24.180
At which point do you let go of the sleeve

38:25.100 --> 38:27.260
and help with the lapel, or do you not need it?

38:27.260 --> 38:28.500
No, I did that.

38:28.500 --> 38:31.380
But first I wanna try to make a grip.

38:31.380 --> 38:34.180
Then I need to establish control before I let go of his arm.

38:34.180 --> 38:35.020
Got it.

38:36.220 --> 38:39.460
So I kept holding that a bit longer.

38:39.460 --> 38:41.660
And then when I fell, okay, I have a good control

38:41.660 --> 38:43.100
over the back, then I let go.

38:46.020 --> 38:49.580
Okay, so you have a light grip on his lapel,

38:49.580 --> 38:52.060
but you're thinking you need to adjust that.

38:52.060 --> 38:52.900
You need to adjust that.

38:53.180 --> 38:55.100
You're like holding it there, and you're thinking,

38:55.100 --> 38:56.580
okay, at some point I need to adjust this.

38:56.580 --> 38:58.820
All I need, all I want is to get under his chin.

38:58.820 --> 39:01.980
Then I know, I mean, now I can't go for it.

39:01.980 --> 39:03.780
Because if it's over, there's no choke, right?

39:03.780 --> 39:05.980
The wrist needs to be under.

39:05.980 --> 39:08.180
Can you choke Buccecio over the...

39:08.180 --> 39:09.020
No, I can't.

39:09.020 --> 39:10.340
That's just not right.

39:10.340 --> 39:11.180
Okay.

39:11.180 --> 39:12.260
It's not right or it doesn't work?

39:12.260 --> 39:13.380
It both.

39:13.380 --> 39:14.980
It's not right and it doesn't work.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.100
I mean, would you tap to a choke on your chin?

39:17.100 --> 39:18.260
No, it's just pressure.

39:19.540 --> 39:21.380
You hurt, but it's not gonna choke you out.

39:21.380 --> 39:22.220
I don't know.

39:22.900 --> 39:23.740
Let me argue this.

39:23.740 --> 39:24.580
I love this.

39:24.580 --> 39:26.340
Arguing with Haji Gray thinking about chokes.

39:26.340 --> 39:27.180
This is great.

39:27.180 --> 39:29.260
Okay, like clock choke.

39:29.260 --> 39:30.340
It was always interesting to me,

39:30.340 --> 39:34.860
because in judo it's illegal to have the gear on the face.

39:34.860 --> 39:37.220
And so it was kind of liberating for me

39:37.220 --> 39:41.060
to be allowed to have gear on the face.

39:41.060 --> 39:41.900
No, it's just...

39:41.900 --> 39:43.260
Liberating.

39:43.260 --> 39:45.260
No, you don't have to worry about it.

39:45.260 --> 39:47.020
Of course it's more effective to go under the chin,

39:47.020 --> 39:49.860
but I'm surprised just because the amount of pressure.

39:49.860 --> 39:51.580
It's all about how much you can take it.

39:51.620 --> 39:52.620
You can take a lot.

39:52.620 --> 39:53.780
But it feels like...

39:53.780 --> 39:54.900
No, it doesn't feel comfortable.

39:54.900 --> 39:57.100
I mean, sometimes on your mouth it cuts your mouth,

39:57.100 --> 39:58.380
now you're bleeding, it feels horrible.

39:58.380 --> 40:00.060
No, but that's not the feeling.

40:00.060 --> 40:01.540
The feeling, it might not be a choke,

40:01.540 --> 40:04.380
but the feeling like it's a pressure

40:04.380 --> 40:06.180
that everything's just closing in.

40:06.180 --> 40:07.540
But it doesn't take you anywhere.

40:07.540 --> 40:08.940
Like you're not gonna go to sleep.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.020
You might not go to sleep.

40:10.020 --> 40:11.700
So it's just pressure.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.500
Yes.

40:13.500 --> 40:16.220
So pressure, it hurts, it's uncomfortable,

40:16.220 --> 40:18.740
but it is not gonna break your face

40:18.740 --> 40:20.180
and it's not gonna put you to sleep.

40:20.180 --> 40:22.940
So if I don't get the neck, I don't go for the kill.

40:24.180 --> 40:27.900
I'm like, I'm holding his collar.

40:28.820 --> 40:31.100
You know, my wrist is almost under.

40:31.940 --> 40:35.580
It's, you know, I'm trying to kind of dig in.

40:35.580 --> 40:38.260
If I can't dig in, then I will adjust the collar,

40:38.260 --> 40:39.500
but first I need to dig in.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.300
Dig in first then adjust.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.140
Can you do all that with one hand or no?

40:43.140 --> 40:43.980
I did.

40:45.820 --> 40:48.220
So you can tighten the choke with just one hand?

40:48.220 --> 40:51.580
No, I need the second one to open the lapel.

40:51.580 --> 40:53.180
But you're like digging in with one hand.

40:53.180 --> 40:54.980
I'm digging in under the chin.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.340
Under is under, now I need to go deeper.

40:57.340 --> 41:00.060
But that, the going deeper requires a second hand.

41:00.060 --> 41:00.900
It does.

41:00.900 --> 41:02.660
Okay, it does.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.780
But that requires you letting go of the other hand.

41:04.780 --> 41:06.540
Yeah, I have to let go eventually.

41:07.620 --> 41:08.460
Yeah, see?

41:08.460 --> 41:09.300
All right.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.380
Well, that's over.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.940
Yeah, because I'm already under his,

41:12.940 --> 41:15.660
like the first hand got under the chin.

41:15.660 --> 41:18.100
Do you need the hand on the second lapel?

41:18.940 --> 41:21.860
Yeah, of course, otherwise he turns and he's out.

41:21.860 --> 41:23.100
That's the control of the turning

41:23.100 --> 41:24.780
versus the tightening of the choke.

41:24.780 --> 41:26.340
Yeah, it does both.

41:26.340 --> 41:30.860
It helps tighten the collar and stop the person rolling out.

41:38.020 --> 41:42.740
Were you feeling pretty good about this position?

41:42.740 --> 41:43.580
Yes.

41:43.580 --> 41:47.460
I just felt it's getting tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter.

41:47.460 --> 41:49.780
It wasn't super tight from the beginning.

41:49.780 --> 41:51.260
It wasn't like the perfect choke.

41:51.260 --> 41:53.580
So it was still, I mean, I knew it was like,

41:53.580 --> 41:55.580
it's very close to the end, but you know,

41:55.580 --> 41:56.740
I still need to adjust.

41:56.740 --> 41:58.940
There was still the risk of maybe he escaping.

41:58.940 --> 42:00.860
Is it possible for his head to slip out?

42:00.860 --> 42:02.860
Yeah, it's possible, yes.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.500
But I'm closing that gap.

42:06.700 --> 42:07.860
Yeah.

42:07.860 --> 42:08.700
Right here.

42:10.860 --> 42:12.300
What did that feel like?

42:12.300 --> 42:13.140
Relief?

42:13.140 --> 42:15.820
Relief, like awesome.

42:15.820 --> 42:16.660
That is.

42:17.980 --> 42:19.700
Somebody on Reddit asked,

42:19.700 --> 42:23.020
ask him about the cross grip he used to sweep

42:23.020 --> 42:25.620
followed with a genius grip switch

42:25.620 --> 42:26.900
when Buchescha was inverted.

42:26.900 --> 42:29.140
Did you use a cross grip when you sweeped?

42:29.140 --> 42:31.260
I guess the cross grip in the arm, that must be it.

42:31.260 --> 42:32.860
Oh, that's the cross grip.

42:32.860 --> 42:34.300
Okay.

42:34.300 --> 42:35.940
What's the genius behind that?

42:35.940 --> 42:40.100
Or was that just the, do you like that kind of grip?

42:40.100 --> 42:42.980
Yeah, because I always like close guard

42:42.980 --> 42:46.380
and no one wants to be in anyone's close guard, right?

42:46.380 --> 42:49.700
It's open guard is the step to pass.

42:49.700 --> 42:52.260
So everybody, when you try to close the guard,

42:52.260 --> 42:54.020
they bring the knee in the middle.

42:54.020 --> 42:58.260
Like if you're not standing, if you're lower on the ground

42:58.260 --> 43:00.220
and the open guard, if you're close to me,

43:00.220 --> 43:01.700
you need that knee between.

43:01.700 --> 43:03.180
So it's a must.

43:03.180 --> 43:06.060
That's when I start developing the attack.

43:06.060 --> 43:08.860
You know, I managed to have long legs to close

43:08.860 --> 43:11.020
my legs around people even with that.

43:11.020 --> 43:13.540
And then I just developed that sweep.

43:13.540 --> 43:15.780
When did you start developing that?

43:15.780 --> 43:19.260
I don't remember when, but I would say before black belt.

43:19.260 --> 43:23.260
Okay, so your answer to that is not to figure out

43:23.260 --> 43:26.180
how to prevent them from putting the knee in.

43:26.180 --> 43:27.300
Is there an answer to that?

43:27.300 --> 43:28.140
No.

43:29.020 --> 43:31.340
But good guys will always try to get the knee in.

43:31.340 --> 43:32.940
No, you can't remove the leg out of the way.

43:32.940 --> 43:33.900
That's not possible.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.980
Well, maybe off balance them enough to where it's not.

43:35.980 --> 43:36.820
No.

43:36.820 --> 43:37.660
Okay.

43:37.660 --> 43:39.980
I mean, you can try, but like it's hard.

43:39.980 --> 43:42.420
If you cannot off balance, you sweep them.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.260
Right.

43:43.260 --> 43:44.620
So that knee is going to, so you're going to have to

43:44.620 --> 43:45.460
solve that problem.

43:45.460 --> 43:46.740
That's a full sweep, yeah.

43:46.740 --> 43:51.460
Because that is extremely common to have that.

43:51.460 --> 43:54.700
I mean, if I'm on your guard, open guard,

43:54.700 --> 43:55.860
you know, if you have your legs,

43:55.860 --> 43:58.180
if I'm between both of your legs in the open guard,

43:58.180 --> 43:59.420
my knee will be between your legs.

43:59.420 --> 44:00.940
Cause it's a must.

44:00.940 --> 44:02.540
My knee cannot be on the floor.

44:03.500 --> 44:06.060
Since Hanzo was there, what did he tell you before?

44:06.060 --> 44:08.180
I think just motivate you.

44:08.180 --> 44:12.060
I think that Hanzo always did that fantastically well

44:12.060 --> 44:13.460
to motivate me.

44:13.460 --> 44:17.020
Like before in fight a match, I think that, you know,

44:17.020 --> 44:19.860
the confidence, you know, his, you know,

44:19.860 --> 44:21.860
his energy being around you, it's,

44:21.860 --> 44:24.980
I think that's the, it's the great thing to have

44:24.980 --> 44:25.820
hands on your corner.

44:25.820 --> 44:28.140
It is the motivation that he gives you.

44:28.140 --> 44:29.900
What did you learn about Jiu-Jitsu in life

44:29.900 --> 44:31.620
from Hanzo Gracie?

44:31.620 --> 44:33.740
We got to hang out with him in Vegas a little bit.

44:33.740 --> 44:37.780
He's a character, he's one of the historic coaches

44:38.300 --> 44:39.300
in Jiu-Jitsu competitors,

44:39.300 --> 44:42.140
but also personalities in the martial arts world

44:42.140 --> 44:43.460
in the world in general.

44:43.460 --> 44:44.660
There's very few like him.

44:44.660 --> 44:47.380
Hanzo is a fantastic person.

44:47.380 --> 44:51.420
It's, it's, you know, what I've learned most from him

44:51.420 --> 44:54.140
is like, it's, you know, you can't take any challenge.

44:54.140 --> 44:58.100
It's, you know, it doesn't matter where and where,

44:58.100 --> 45:01.860
what, you know, who it's, you know, you have to be ready.

45:01.860 --> 45:05.500
And, you know, with that warrior spirit that he has,

45:05.740 --> 45:08.660
you know, he always took any challenge,

45:08.660 --> 45:09.700
ready or not ready.

45:11.900 --> 45:14.460
Was it you that said it or he said it where,

45:15.620 --> 45:20.620
not until you go in, you know, to do something difficult

45:22.060 --> 45:23.860
do you discover the strength that you have.

45:23.860 --> 45:27.060
So like, if you really think about it,

45:28.380 --> 45:30.740
you might think that you don't, you're not good enough.

45:30.740 --> 45:33.100
You don't have the strength to take on something difficult.

45:33.100 --> 45:33.940
I fully agree.

45:33.940 --> 45:37.420
I think we are measured not when we're on the strongest,

45:37.420 --> 45:39.620
but when we are on the weakest.

45:39.620 --> 45:42.620
That's when we truly measure ourselves or character,

45:42.620 --> 45:45.860
who we are, not when we're in a position of power

45:45.860 --> 45:47.580
or when we're in a position of weakness.

45:47.580 --> 45:49.100
Have you surprised yourself?

45:49.100 --> 45:51.500
Like how damn good you are?

45:51.500 --> 45:54.660
Like, is this, is this really how good I am

45:54.660 --> 45:55.940
in this situation?

45:55.940 --> 45:57.460
Where in retrospect you might think

45:57.460 --> 45:59.100
how the hell was I able to accomplish this?

45:59.100 --> 46:04.100
Not how good I am because otherwise I wouldn't be there.

46:04.860 --> 46:07.180
So, you know, being there in the first place,

46:07.180 --> 46:10.540
it's already not a great thing.

46:10.540 --> 46:15.220
But I say, you know, every single time I found myself there,

46:15.220 --> 46:19.100
I was super proud that I've never cracked.

46:19.100 --> 46:24.100
Like I've never gave up ever, any second, any fight, never.

46:24.340 --> 46:26.100
Never been broken in competition.

46:26.100 --> 46:26.940
Never.

46:26.940 --> 46:29.460
Even, it's not about winning or losing.

46:29.460 --> 46:31.580
It's about you giving up.

46:31.580 --> 46:32.980
I've never doubt myself.

46:32.980 --> 46:36.540
I always fought to the very end, always.

46:36.540 --> 46:38.420
That I'm most proud of.

46:39.780 --> 46:41.060
Because there was moments, you know,

46:41.060 --> 46:43.820
it's, you're in a terrible position.

46:43.820 --> 46:45.420
You know, mainly like there was moments

46:45.420 --> 46:48.980
that I was super tired, but like exhaustive tired

46:48.980 --> 46:51.540
when it was easy to give up.

46:51.540 --> 46:53.980
Like I had nothing more to give,

46:54.020 --> 46:56.300
but I pushed.

46:56.300 --> 47:00.660
I took energy out of my soul, I'll have to say.

47:00.660 --> 47:05.660
Because when my body had zero, my spirit, my soul,

47:05.780 --> 47:06.620
pull it out.

47:07.540 --> 47:10.740
Is that in part just not allowing yourself to have,

47:12.740 --> 47:14.620
to ever quit?

47:14.620 --> 47:16.180
Yeah.

47:16.180 --> 47:19.100
I have one other thing I regret.

47:19.100 --> 47:21.460
I remember like a blue belt match.

47:21.460 --> 47:22.580
I remember.

47:22.580 --> 47:24.620
I'm not going to say who it was against,

47:24.620 --> 47:28.860
but I remember it as just being extremely exhausted

47:29.940 --> 47:32.300
and just constantly fighting.

47:32.300 --> 47:35.220
A guy was really good mount, really good guard passing.

47:35.220 --> 47:40.220
And I just remember him passing my guard eventually.

47:40.460 --> 47:41.420
So it was just like a finals

47:41.420 --> 47:43.860
of one of the IBGJF tournaments.

47:43.860 --> 47:48.860
And then right away going to mount and just,

47:50.860 --> 47:51.700
I don't know.

47:52.020 --> 47:55.540
The level of frustration, I mean, I quit at that point.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.500
So I remember that still.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.500
It's not about winning or losing,

47:59.500 --> 48:04.420
but I just remember I was teary-eyed frustrated.

48:04.420 --> 48:07.620
And then I knew there was a lot of fights still left

48:07.620 --> 48:09.740
in there somewhere and I quit.

48:09.740 --> 48:11.660
And I regret that to this day.

48:11.660 --> 48:13.900
Because I think the reason I regret that

48:13.900 --> 48:16.900
is because it gave me an option to now quit

48:16.900 --> 48:18.780
in every other aspect of life.

48:19.900 --> 48:20.980
This is an option.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.460
It is.

48:23.460 --> 48:24.300
It sucks.

48:26.260 --> 48:28.060
Yeah, it teaches you, you know.

48:28.060 --> 48:30.060
It makes us stronger.

48:30.060 --> 48:31.500
I think it made you stronger.

48:32.700 --> 48:34.260
Yeah, it makes you stronger that you did that

48:34.260 --> 48:36.180
to learn that don't do that again.

48:37.580 --> 48:41.820
But still, like you said, just going to sleep and training,

48:41.820 --> 48:43.300
I do think it made me weaker.

48:43.300 --> 48:45.740
It did make me weaker in the rest of my life too.

48:45.740 --> 48:48.500
Those, you know, I've quit a few times in my life

48:48.500 --> 48:50.460
on small things and you realize,

48:50.460 --> 48:51.900
okay, it's not that big of a deal.

48:51.900 --> 48:53.060
It's fine.

48:53.060 --> 48:53.940
Like, who cares?

48:55.100 --> 48:56.660
But that, what you learn over time

48:56.660 --> 48:57.980
is that voice always comes there.

48:57.980 --> 49:02.100
Like, obviously, maybe it does for you too,

49:02.100 --> 49:03.940
even at the highest level of like,

49:03.940 --> 49:04.980
it's not that big of a deal.

49:04.980 --> 49:06.740
Like, it's okay to quit here.

49:07.740 --> 49:08.580
Like, it makes sense.

49:08.580 --> 49:09.940
Everybody would understand.

49:12.100 --> 49:15.620
You know, in some sense, like you're, you know,

49:15.620 --> 49:17.300
many people would say you're past your prime

49:17.300 --> 49:18.940
in this match with the Brescia.

49:18.940 --> 49:20.140
Like, it makes sense.

49:21.020 --> 49:21.860
Like, you've been focusing on MMA.

49:21.860 --> 49:22.700
It makes sense.

49:22.700 --> 49:25.460
It makes sense to lose.

49:25.460 --> 49:26.780
Yeah, I don't know.

49:26.780 --> 49:28.260
That's a weird voice.

49:28.260 --> 49:31.140
And in some sense, it's that voice

49:31.140 --> 49:34.260
and a voice that says, like, why are you doing this?

49:34.260 --> 49:35.820
Like, this is silly.

49:35.820 --> 49:36.980
Doesn't make any sense.

49:36.980 --> 49:38.780
Just stop, just stop, just stop.

49:41.780 --> 49:43.420
And shutting that voice down

49:43.420 --> 49:44.660
and never allowing yourself to quit.

49:44.660 --> 49:45.580
That's a really powerful thing.

49:45.580 --> 49:47.020
Like, everybody I've met,

49:47.980 --> 49:49.860
everybody that's successful.

49:51.780 --> 49:56.300
Yeah, down to the, even engineers, CEOs, Elon Musk.

49:56.300 --> 49:57.340
Just never quitting.

49:58.420 --> 50:01.500
Like, when everybody around you says quit, never quitting.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.340
It's weird.

50:02.340 --> 50:03.180
I don't know what that is.

50:03.180 --> 50:04.900
Might be genetic.

50:04.900 --> 50:07.300
It might be like using the stubbornness

50:07.300 --> 50:12.300
to just never allow yourself to develop that.

50:12.580 --> 50:14.820
It's basically developing a callousness

50:14.820 --> 50:17.740
to that voice that tries to tell you to quit.

50:17.740 --> 50:19.380
You never quit, huh?

50:19.380 --> 50:21.460
What would you attribute that to?

50:21.460 --> 50:25.140
It's like how much you want

50:25.140 --> 50:27.500
to get to the destination you chose.

50:27.500 --> 50:30.580
Like, you know, it's how badly you wanna get there.

50:31.940 --> 50:33.900
If you quit, you're never gonna get there.

50:33.900 --> 50:34.900
And you always wanted to.

50:34.900 --> 50:35.900
I always wanted to.

50:37.780 --> 50:40.620
Is there some thing you remember from that match?

50:40.620 --> 50:42.300
Some things that happened before and after

50:42.300 --> 50:43.700
that stand out to you?

50:43.700 --> 50:44.780
Just since in Rio.

50:44.780 --> 50:49.100
Yeah, there was an interview prior to the fight.

50:49.100 --> 50:50.020
There was a big fight.

50:50.020 --> 50:53.020
We were doing media every day before.

50:53.020 --> 50:55.340
Me and him, we were meeting for media.

50:55.340 --> 50:59.860
And it's like five days before, five, six days before.

50:59.860 --> 51:00.780
I'm quite chatty.

51:02.180 --> 51:05.060
The closer we get to the fight, the more focus I get,

51:05.060 --> 51:10.180
the less I start joking around playing with people.

51:10.180 --> 51:12.540
But I remember, I think it was maybe three or four days

51:12.540 --> 51:14.780
before we were doing an interview together.

51:15.660 --> 51:17.220
I think my cousin, Kira, was there.

51:17.220 --> 51:20.260
She was doing one of the interviews with us.

51:20.260 --> 51:24.940
And I don't remember exactly what we were talking about,

51:24.940 --> 51:26.700
but I just remember, we were talking about the fight,

51:26.700 --> 51:28.180
of course, and then it was, you know,

51:28.180 --> 51:30.700
we were standing beside each other.

51:30.700 --> 51:32.940
And I'm like, and then, you know,

51:32.940 --> 51:35.940
suddenly I jump in and grab him by the neck.

51:35.940 --> 51:37.820
I say, I'm gonna tap you by the neck.

51:37.820 --> 51:40.020
And then he's like, you know, very shy.

51:40.020 --> 51:40.860
And then I let go.

51:40.860 --> 51:43.380
He said, no, I'm gonna tap you by the arm.

51:43.380 --> 51:46.740
And I could feel he was like, he wasn't comfortable,

51:46.740 --> 51:48.980
you know, with being there, you know,

51:48.980 --> 51:50.620
me saying that I'm gonna tap him out,

51:50.620 --> 51:54.300
there was like, I was so relaxed, joking about it,

51:54.300 --> 51:56.300
but I'm joking that I'm gonna tap him out

51:56.300 --> 51:58.820
in a fight that we're gonna have in four days time.

51:58.820 --> 52:03.820
And yeah, I felt he was like, not comfortable at all.

52:04.300 --> 52:05.900
Do you think you got in his head a little bit?

52:05.900 --> 52:06.740
Yeah, I did.

52:06.740 --> 52:07.660
To give you a little bit of confidence?

52:07.660 --> 52:08.500
Yeah.

52:08.500 --> 52:10.260
You've said that Jiu-Jitsu is a reflection

52:10.260 --> 52:11.260
of your personality.

52:11.260 --> 52:13.220
So both your Jiu-Jitsu and your personality,

52:13.220 --> 52:14.340
there's a calmness.

52:14.340 --> 52:15.180
What is that?

52:15.180 --> 52:16.380
Why are you so calm?

52:16.380 --> 52:19.300
Is there like an ocean underneath that's boiling?

52:19.300 --> 52:21.260
Is this developed or is this your personality?

52:21.260 --> 52:24.580
Are you basically leveraging who you are already

52:24.580 --> 52:26.820
to develop a game around the Jiu-Jitsu

52:26.820 --> 52:29.380
or did Jiu-Jitsu make you calm?

52:29.380 --> 52:30.540
I think both.

52:30.540 --> 52:32.860
I was always very calm since I was a kid,

52:32.860 --> 52:34.500
you know, since very young.

52:34.500 --> 52:37.180
I was never very fiery person.

52:37.180 --> 52:39.020
So that is a reflection.

52:39.260 --> 52:41.500
It reflected on my Jiu-Jitsu, my life,

52:41.500 --> 52:43.380
on my fights, the way I fight.

52:43.380 --> 52:47.340
So it's a direct influence of my personality.

52:47.340 --> 52:49.660
And I think it's also in the day,

52:49.660 --> 52:52.860
you develop the more you practice,

52:52.860 --> 52:54.140
the more you fight.

52:54.140 --> 52:57.500
It's like, you don't want to get nervous.

52:57.500 --> 52:58.740
You don't want the adrenaline in.

52:58.740 --> 53:02.820
So you just learn how to shut that off from your mind.

53:02.820 --> 53:04.660
So the less I thought about it,

53:04.660 --> 53:06.500
it's like how many times I fought.

53:07.460 --> 53:09.260
Let's say the week before the fight,

53:09.260 --> 53:13.500
that's when you start more, when you're concerned the most

53:13.500 --> 53:15.060
because now it's getting very close.

53:15.060 --> 53:16.780
Before it's just far away.

53:16.780 --> 53:19.180
You know, it's normal to think of the tournament.

53:19.180 --> 53:22.020
You get a bit nervous, but it goes away quick.

53:22.020 --> 53:23.900
But the fight, you know, the week before,

53:23.900 --> 53:26.860
now you're constantly thinking of that day.

53:26.860 --> 53:29.140
And every time you think, adrenaline pumps in,

53:29.140 --> 53:30.780
your heart accelerate.

53:30.780 --> 53:32.620
You know, it doesn't, you know, it makes it,

53:32.620 --> 53:34.460
it's like, why am I feeling this?

53:34.460 --> 53:35.660
What difference will it make?

53:35.660 --> 53:38.060
So you kind of, you're shutting that thought

53:38.060 --> 53:38.900
out of your mind,

53:38.900 --> 53:41.180
because you don't want to feel the adrenaline,

53:41.180 --> 53:42.700
your heart accelerating.

53:42.700 --> 53:44.620
It's not going to add you anything.

53:44.620 --> 53:46.780
So it's, you know, it's the practice also

53:46.780 --> 53:50.980
that I think it helped me to shut that off my mind.

53:50.980 --> 53:52.700
Has that helped you in regular life?

53:52.700 --> 53:53.980
Yeah, of course.

53:53.980 --> 53:58.980
It's, you know, suddenly when you go into any situation

53:59.060 --> 54:00.380
that might be stressful, you know,

54:00.380 --> 54:03.700
like an important meeting or super whatever it is,

54:03.700 --> 54:06.900
it's like, how much would you worry about that before?

54:06.900 --> 54:08.700
Worry is not going to help you anywhere.

54:08.700 --> 54:10.060
It's the opposite.

54:10.060 --> 54:11.460
Just going to make you more nervous,

54:11.460 --> 54:12.900
your heart accelerate,

54:12.900 --> 54:16.860
your ability to think clearly is going to be damaged by that.

54:16.860 --> 54:21.820
So it's like the more calm, the more relaxed you are,

54:21.820 --> 54:23.980
the better you can think of.

54:23.980 --> 54:25.340
Do you ever get angry?

54:25.340 --> 54:26.380
Yeah.

54:26.380 --> 54:27.300
Like in traffic?

54:28.380 --> 54:31.340
Do you ever get like not calm, just like you're screaming?

54:31.380 --> 54:33.940
No, not in a screaming, no.

54:33.940 --> 54:35.380
But just angry.

54:35.380 --> 54:36.420
What does angry look like?

54:36.420 --> 54:37.380
Is it still calm?

54:39.500 --> 54:41.580
Yeah, like a few seconds of complaining,

54:41.580 --> 54:42.820
but then it goes away.

54:42.820 --> 54:44.700
Have you ever like thrown a cell phone at a wall

54:44.700 --> 54:46.300
or something like that of anger?

54:47.460 --> 54:50.380
No, I never get that angry, but that's just silly.

54:50.380 --> 54:54.340
It's like it's, if I would have done that,

54:54.340 --> 54:57.500
I would not be able to control my emotions prior to a fight.

54:58.460 --> 55:00.540
That would be a reflection.

55:00.540 --> 55:02.820
Letting yourself lose control.

55:02.820 --> 55:06.580
Losing control that will reflect other times.

55:07.660 --> 55:11.900
Do you think it has in part made you

55:11.900 --> 55:14.540
more emotionally closed off from the world?

55:14.540 --> 55:17.780
Like it's harder for you to be vulnerable to others?

55:17.780 --> 55:19.220
Probably.

55:19.220 --> 55:21.580
Yeah, but I heard that a few times.

55:22.540 --> 55:23.900
I'm emotionally closed.

55:23.900 --> 55:25.900
It's, yeah, maybe.

55:25.900 --> 55:27.380
I think that influenced it.

55:27.380 --> 55:28.220
Yeah.

55:28.220 --> 55:29.740
Have you ever cried in a movie?

55:29.740 --> 55:31.860
Yeah, not for many years,

55:31.860 --> 55:33.740
but for that I think maybe I'm getting older.

55:33.740 --> 55:34.580
Do you remember the movie?

55:34.580 --> 55:36.780
Something, no, it's a silly movie.

55:36.780 --> 55:38.180
I mean, it's, no, I mean-

55:38.180 --> 55:39.220
Is it The Notebook?

55:39.220 --> 55:44.020
No, I mean, I would say the last few years

55:44.020 --> 55:46.820
I've been crying more than before for some reason.

55:46.820 --> 55:47.660
I don't know why.

55:47.660 --> 55:48.500
Like silly movies.

55:48.500 --> 55:51.740
Like nothing suddenly brings tears to my eyes.

55:51.740 --> 55:52.580
Yeah.

55:52.580 --> 55:54.140
Well, I've already just,

55:54.140 --> 55:56.140
having met you and interacted with you,

55:56.140 --> 55:58.900
I can see that you're kind of opening your heart

55:58.900 --> 56:00.220
and your mind to the world.

56:00.220 --> 56:01.820
You could see like,

56:01.820 --> 56:06.820
here's this historically great athlete.

56:06.980 --> 56:09.220
Now like the wars have been fought

56:09.220 --> 56:11.420
and you're now like waking up to the world.

56:11.420 --> 56:12.460
It's cool to see.

56:12.460 --> 56:14.060
Probably I'm bringing my guard down now.

56:14.060 --> 56:16.020
I don't have to keep it up all the time.

56:16.020 --> 56:17.460
That's a good fight.

56:17.460 --> 56:20.860
You can even do some podcasts.

56:20.860 --> 56:23.500
You said you watched like movies beforehand sometimes.

56:23.500 --> 56:24.700
You mentioned Braveheart.

56:24.700 --> 56:25.540
What were you doing?

56:25.540 --> 56:28.020
Did you watch something beforehand like the day before?

56:28.020 --> 56:28.860
I used to, yeah.

56:28.860 --> 56:33.860
There was like I think Braveheart and Gladiator.

56:36.420 --> 56:37.780
I mean, there's a few others

56:37.780 --> 56:39.780
that I've always watched the day before

56:39.780 --> 56:41.540
because the day before I used to do nothing.

56:41.540 --> 56:43.980
I just want to be at home in bed watching TV,

56:43.980 --> 56:47.460
like saving energy, stretching by myself.

56:47.460 --> 56:49.860
So I was like, I just want to save energy.

56:49.860 --> 56:52.980
I don't want to waste my energy going out, going around.

56:52.980 --> 56:56.300
So those are the movies that I always like to watch.

56:56.300 --> 57:00.460
Kind of try to bring some hyper excitement,

57:00.460 --> 57:02.660
like I'm getting ready to war tomorrow.

57:02.660 --> 57:05.300
So I'm like, let me watch some movies

57:05.300 --> 57:09.380
that brought that warrior spirit into me.

57:09.380 --> 57:10.860
Yeah, what is that about human nature?

57:10.860 --> 57:13.740
Braveheart I love even more.

57:13.740 --> 57:16.220
Should you put your life on the line

57:16.220 --> 57:20.620
for a thing that matters or run away just so you can live?

57:20.620 --> 57:24.300
It's like running, you may live, but like years from now,

57:24.300 --> 57:26.620
when you look back at this moment,

57:26.620 --> 57:28.780
would you trade all the days

57:29.820 --> 57:32.540
just to come back to this moment?

57:32.540 --> 57:33.620
And tell the English.

57:34.580 --> 57:37.820
You could take our lives, but you can't take our freedom.

57:37.820 --> 57:42.340
I mean, oh man, what is that about human nature?

57:44.540 --> 57:47.140
Is there some aspect of like the glory you were able

57:47.140 --> 57:51.900
to achieve being more important than anything else?

57:51.940 --> 57:55.660
There's some aspect of that, that's greatness, you know?

57:55.660 --> 57:58.340
Yeah, I never pursue glory.

57:58.340 --> 58:02.300
So it just came, you came with it,

58:02.300 --> 58:04.220
but that was never my goal.

58:04.220 --> 58:07.140
I never care for glory.

58:07.140 --> 58:09.900
Were you able to experience like,

58:10.940 --> 58:13.180
like I'm at the height of this thing.

58:13.180 --> 58:16.300
Whatever humanity is able to achieve in various things,

58:16.300 --> 58:18.340
holy shit, I'm flying.

58:18.340 --> 58:23.340
I felt like no one can touch me.

58:24.140 --> 58:26.180
I can destroy people.

58:26.180 --> 58:27.020
Yeah.

58:27.020 --> 58:29.180
Prolonged periods of time or just momentarily?

58:31.940 --> 58:36.140
I always knew, you know, from before I got to a black belt,

58:36.140 --> 58:39.020
that like, you know, I can be great

58:39.020 --> 58:42.140
because I used to train with the best in the world.

58:42.140 --> 58:44.140
I used to, you know, for many years

58:44.140 --> 58:48.180
and I used to see my progression with and everybody else.

58:49.020 --> 58:51.300
So I knew I was getting somewhere.

58:51.300 --> 58:54.260
I knew I could be the best.

58:54.260 --> 58:57.380
And that was always my goal since very, very young.

58:58.340 --> 59:01.060
And I always believed that I could be.

59:01.060 --> 59:02.900
And that over the years,

59:02.900 --> 59:05.620
that kept telling me over and over again,

59:05.620 --> 59:08.700
because I'm getting better and better,

59:08.700 --> 59:11.060
faster than everybody else.

59:11.060 --> 59:14.100
So it's, I just need to carry on with what I'm doing.

59:14.100 --> 59:17.380
But I think you've said that you wanted to,

59:17.380 --> 59:20.620
and maybe you thought you could be the greatest of all time,

59:21.540 --> 59:23.740
like at the very beginning,

59:23.740 --> 59:24.980
like when you sucked.

59:26.540 --> 59:29.980
Yeah, not the greatest of all time because,

59:29.980 --> 59:31.980
and I never really thought about that,

59:31.980 --> 59:34.100
but I thought I'm gonna be the best in the world

59:34.100 --> 59:36.100
when I sucked, when I sucked.

59:36.100 --> 59:37.620
Okay, so what is that,

59:39.420 --> 59:42.420
what is that, like that self-belief?

59:42.420 --> 59:44.660
Is there a component to that self-belief

59:44.660 --> 59:46.300
being a prerequisite?

59:46.540 --> 59:50.420
It's difficult to say because that was a decision, I think.

59:50.420 --> 59:53.980
Like, why did I believe that I could be?

59:53.980 --> 59:56.420
I can't tell you that, because I don't know.

59:56.420 --> 59:57.700
But you think you decided to be.

59:57.700 --> 59:59.580
I decided to be, I decided to be,

59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.420
and I believed I could.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.820
You think there was like a day somewhere when you were young,

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:04.780
where you were like, huh,

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.820
you're sitting on a couch eating Cheetos.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:11.060
I don't think it was a day, like a moment,

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:15.620
because for many years,

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.700
I wasn't really training much as a child.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.860
I used to train and then stop,

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.060
done a bit of Jiu-Jitsu, never stay away from it much,

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:29.060
but until, you know, like from 10 to 14,

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.780
I barely trained Jiu-Jitsu much.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.020
I used to, there was no Gracie school

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.980
near where I used to live,

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.980
and there was a Jiu-Jitsu, a Jiu-Jitsu school,

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.180
I used to go twice a week.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:43.300
I went to a Jiu-Jitsu tournament,

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.420
I lost in five seconds, left crying.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.660
The guy, he pulled me in five seconds.

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:52.700
Anyway, so when I was 14,

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:56.500
I went to the south of Brazil to see my uncle, William,

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.900
to spend summer holidays.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.020
I was there for like four weeks, I think.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.020
And when I got there,

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.740
my cousin Holly's were living with him.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.420
Holly's like bigger than me.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.140
It was, I think it's four years, four years older.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.900
So I was 14, I was already 18, 17, 18.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.860
Purple belt competitor.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.740
And I think that was the first time in my life

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.420
that I felt what it mean, what it meant to be a Gracie

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.300
in terms of having a school, teaching, training,

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.700
you know, living that, you know, Jiu-Jitsu lifestyle,

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.300
what a Gracie mean to be.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.740
And I've just, I've loved that.

01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.380
I was out of shape.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.220
My uncle was like, you know,

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:38.340
incentivizing me to lose weight, to train,

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:39.580
but you're not training, why?

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.060
You know, it's like, you've got a shape,

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:41.900
you need to diet.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:45.460
So I used to run every day, I was eating super well.

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.060
I start, you know, I start, that when I start changing.

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.140
So when I go back to Rio,

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.140
I was super motivated to follow up, carry on.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.900
And he, you know, he invited me to go back there

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.460
to live with him, but I couldn't,

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.540
it was too soon to change schools and everything.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.260
My mom said, no, but maybe next year,

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.620
if you wanna go, you can.

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.780
So I kept that in my mind.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:10.980
Next year, I moved to the South to live with him.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:15.100
I was 15, and it was him, my uncle, Hillion,

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.020
and my uncle, Crawlin.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:18.740
They both used to live very close to each other.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.220
They used to have their own schools close to each other.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:25.060
So I was with both, and I stayed there for almost a year.

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.580
I mean, I was the youngest in the academy.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.740
There was some, you know, blue, purple bells, normal guy,

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.500
but they're already competing, training ahead of me.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.660
And I just joined the group of training.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.180
I didn't compete while I was there,

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.420
because there was no competition at that time.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:41.300
And I wasn't really ready,

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.180
but it's not about competing, it's more about the training.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.780
And I started training every day, started improving.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.620
And a year after that, when I came back to Rio,

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.900
I was already on a mission.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.580
I was like, I love this.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.700
I'm just carrying on training every day

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:55.940
with my uncle, Carlos,

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.620
Carlos Gracie Jr., Gracie Baja.

01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.940
And the one I got there,

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.540
I was training a little bit there before,

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.660
but I was just 14, 15.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:08.660
But when I got there, there was one of the most competitive,

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.700
one of the biggest jujitsu schools at the time.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.100
There were so many high level world champions,

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.900
competitors in every single belt.

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.140
And so I've kind of joined in with that.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.380
And I've carried on, I don't remember when,

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.860
but I remember, you know, looking and saying,

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.780
I'm gonna be the best in the world.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:33.100
But I used to be, I was at the bottom of the stairs.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.420
You know, no one really believed me.

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.020
I didn't shout, you know, to disguise,

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.500
but you know, I told a few people,

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.580
I'm like, I'm gonna be the best.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:44.020
And that's, I think, I was just losing,

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.420
but I've never ever doubt.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.500
I've never diverged from that mission, I would say.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.140
Did anyone believe you when you said you can be great?

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:53.980
Nobody.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:54.800
Did it matter?

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.700
It didn't matter.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.900
I don't care, I don't need.

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:58.660
Even people that like love you?

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.100
Everybody, my mom, my dad, I mean, no one thought,

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:05.660
no one in my family thought I was gonna be here today.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:06.740
Nobody.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:08.940
Because I just started late.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.180
You know, I've never had any start that people,

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.020
oh, that kid's gonna be really good.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:17.780
No, my mom was a chubby kid that didn't barely train.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.020
I mean, people used to look at me,

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:22.980
he's just another grace, you know, one more.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.220
What do you learn from that?

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:29.100
Do you think most people lose that self-belief?

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.220
They quit?

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:31.900
When everyone around them doesn't believe?

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.740
Yeah.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:36.860
I think, if those that need approval, yes.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:39.500
Right, so you shouldn't have approval.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.980
No, I'd never need approval from anyone.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:44.020
I don't care if you believe me or not,

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.860
if you're not my problem.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.740
It's tough, it's tough.

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.420
I don't need approval, but

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:56.900
you're surrounded by people older, wiser, better than you,

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:00.140
and they're kind of directly or indirectly saying,

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.340
you stop being a silly kid.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.620
No one ever told me that,

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.900
because that was not something

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.740
that I used to say all the time.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.780
I maybe say it just very, very few times.

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.020
I just want, you know, maybe that's the secret.

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.900
Of course, I mean, if you start shouting,

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.300
then you've just been silly.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.220
Then it's not what you really want.

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.420
Then you're saying that for other reasons,

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.580
if you say it over and over again,

01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.820
because you shouldn't.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:24.900
I mean, why?

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.540
Well, to push back,

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.700
one of the reasons you might want to say it

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:30.900
is to find the right people that believe in you.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.420
Yeah, but no, if you say over and over again,

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.380
then it's just, then you're just bragging.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:40.220
Sure, because one thing is to say it,

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:41.660
but the other one is to do it.

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.340
So it's, you know, you say that once or very few times,

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:47.420
but now you have to do it.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.380
Saying is not helping you getting there.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.420
Was there sacrifices you had to make?

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.420
Everything, everything.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.180
That was my priority in life.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.860
Everything was secondary.

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:02.860
Like social life, career paths, everything.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.580
And from 14, 15, 16, as you get better and better

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.420
and better and better,

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:13.140
it was just becoming sharper, the focus on this thing.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.460
Yeah, it's just over and over again,

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.540
over and over again.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.620
It's, you know, it's just training, training, training.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.660
And I mean, how many times I lost,

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.900
I have no clue.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.660
So on the mat, you were getting beat up.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.100
I'm getting smashed by everybody.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.180
People my age, I was chubby.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.860
I was physically weak.

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.300
I mean, I'm tall, but physically,

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.180
I'm not physically strong.

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.860
I'm normally strong for my size,

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:44.740
but physically, if you wanna measure strength, I'm weak.

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.020
Because, you know, we can measure strength,

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.500
living weight, I'm weak.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:52.460
I don't lift, I lift weight

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.820
same as people much lighter than me.

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.900
Everybody, my weight lifts heavier weight.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.020
And then people that train with you

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.940
often talk about how strong you are.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:01.780
They think I'm super strong.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:02.620
Yeah.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.100
Because I generate a lot of strength.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:08.500
I can create, I put myself in the right angles

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.820
so that I can be strong.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.980
I'm not strong.

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:16.620
And the only person who I listen to saying that

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.180
is Kumpritu, one guy that I fought,

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.740
Rodrigo Medeiros, I fought him a few times.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.580
And he's the only one that I heard saying about me

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.380
that's like, no, Roger's not strong.

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.580
He's not.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:32.060
He's technical and he can create strength,

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.020
but he's not strong.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.060
He meant that as a compliment?

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.740
Yeah, I think so.

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:38.140
No, I think he was honest,

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.620
because I think he's the only one who could see that.

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:42.460
Yes.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.700
So I think that's a compliment.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.500
So he's technically really strong.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.740
So you had an incredible match with him.

01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.580
Yeah.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:54.660
Is there insight you have about how you went

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:59.420
from a person who was not very good,

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:03.980
but had a dream, a confident dream,

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.900
a vision to somebody that was actually good?

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.620
Was there something to the practice sessions?

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.860
Were you getting reps on the specific techniques?

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.700
I'd never done anything special,

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:18.900
because I'm in a gym training equally with everybody else.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:21.540
So I've never did anything on the side

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.300
different than anybody else.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.940
So I was in the school training

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:27.860
exactly the same way as everybody else.

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:28.700
Wow.

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:29.540
In terms of schedule, yes.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.340
But can you reverse engineer

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.900
what was going through your mind?

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:35.220
Because there's so many different ways

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.500
to actually mentally approach

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.860
the same exact training session.

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.500
I'm gonna try to beat you.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.340
Okay.

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:43.380
So in some part it's competitive.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:44.220
Yeah.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.780
The core of it is I want to be better

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.420
than these particular people.

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.420
You're gonna keep beating me.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.340
I'm gonna keep coming back at you.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:54.460
And to do that, I have to solve problems.

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.020
I have to figure out how to do stuff.

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.700
You catch me once.

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.100
I'm gonna keep on coming,

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:02.700
trying to not get caught in that.

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.060
At which point did you develop a game

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:08.740
that was basically the famous white belt game

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:12.220
of the very basics, the very fundamentals of jiu-jitsu?

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:16.460
Like, saying, I'm going to beat you.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:17.300
Never.

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.860
There was never a conscious decision

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:22.820
to try to have a basic jiu-jitsu.

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:26.980
First, I think there's a big misconception there.

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:28.300
Okay, what's the misconception?

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.140
My jiu-jitsu is not basic.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.060
Mr. Roger Gracie, it's not right.

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:31.900
It's not basic.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.020
It's not old school.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.340
I think people, they just don't see that.

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:39.660
It's extremely complex in a way

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:42.460
that people, they cannot copy.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.220
I teach people.

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:47.620
I can teach you the cross-collar choke.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:50.860
But the one thing that people, they don't realize

01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.420
is not the move,

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.940
is you need to practice the movement you learn.

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.380
It's the practice over and over again.

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.220
Like, it took me years.

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:05.260
When I say years, years after I was a black belt,

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.740
I was able to choke people out

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.020
with a cross-collar choking them out, effectively.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.580
Years after I got my black belt.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.140
So that's something that you learn first day, first week.

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:18.060
So I can teach you, it makes no difference.

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.100
You know the theory, but until you apply it,

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.140
it will help you, of course.

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.460
The more details you learn,

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.060
the more tools you have to practice,

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:29.420
but it's still very complex

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.900
because it's not about the move itself.

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.540
It's about how can you control the movement

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.300
of the other person.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.100
He's resisting, you're blocking.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.420
You cannot predict what he will do.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.340
And he's doing a whole bunch of moves to block you.

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.460
Every single move, you do a step of the way

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:49.460
because it's a progression of move from beginning to end

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.300
till I apply the choke.

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.740
It's a progression of move.

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:55.260
And there's not one way to get that.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.740
There's many ways because how many ways can you block?

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.580
You can put your arm in every single angle.

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.500
We have both arms, you can bridge.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.220
So it's dealing with all that.

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:09.220
That is the complexity of the position.

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:11.580
But that goes for everything.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:16.060
Every single move, my strong moves, I would say,

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:19.060
it took me years developing them.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:19.900
Years.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.700
So it's, and you're gonna tell me that's basic,

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.940
so go try and do it.

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.420
What the other person is defending, that's the thing

01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:29.580
because most of the things that I do,

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.300
I've been doing them for years.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.540
And they know that I'm gonna do

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.460
and I can still get it most of the times.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.020
That's the hardest.

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.460
It's when they know what's coming,

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.380
they can still do it.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:46.260
And you said that the way you're able to do that,

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.300
you just have to do it right.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.740
Yeah.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:54.140
What do you learn by doing all the steps along the way?

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.420
And just for people who don't know,

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.700
cross collar choke from the mount.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.860
So you just start in a neutral place,

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:01.940
there's people on their feet,

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.100
and then you either, then you get to the ground somehow

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.340
and then there's the person on top and on bottom,

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:09.140
and then there's a guard with the legs

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.540
between the two people and then you can get past the guard.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:16.140
As you get past the guard and you into side control

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.180
and so on, you get more and more and more

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.540
dominant positions.

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.620
And so mount is considered to be one

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.900
of the most dominant positions.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.660
It's when you're past their legs,

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:27.340
sitting on top of their stomach,

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.060
putting pressure on them.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.020
And cross collar choke is using their jacket to,

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.340
how would you explain that?

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.180
To choke them with their jacket.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.060
So you have the collars,

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:39.020
I put my both hands on your collars

01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:40.700
and when I squeeze,

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:44.380
you press your neck so it blocks the vein,

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.220
you go to sleep.

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:48.100
So you choke people with your hands in the wrist,

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.220
you put them, you know,

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.380
you grab the collar so you get the wrist

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.260
around people's neck and you squeeze.

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:54.100
Yep.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.540
The discovery of that is fascinating.

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.100
I mean, cause it's interesting.

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:57.920
It's like,

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.040
you know, you can imagine there's all kinds of ways

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.400
to choke a human being.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.240
What animals do with their like mouth, right?

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:10.200
They put like their jaws around the,

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.000
and the fact that you can kind of discover this methodology

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.360
of the right kind of positioning

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.040
and then it becomes an art form,

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:20.240
like of why this, why not this, right?

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.920
Or why not this or something,

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.600
like to figure all that out.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.520
We practice, that will come easy.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.800
Over time you figure out what works and what not

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.760
and then more further and further details

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.520
and subtleties start to emerge.

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.680
Anyway, on that process of beating,

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.040
of being able to beat some of the best people in the world

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.760
and the thing they know is coming,

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.680
what is, what's the difference

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.000
between the white belt doing that

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.400
and Hadrian Gracie doing that?

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.320
The thing that's so hard to explain.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.200
What do you think you're picking up?

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.480
Is it some tiny, tiny details of muscle movements?

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.320
It is.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.280
It's many tiny details

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.880
because it's the whole movement itself.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.080
It's the perception from beginning to end.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.160
Like every step of that movement,

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.280
it's important and precise.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.560
So it's, you know, you miss one detail on the way,

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.040
you collapse.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.920
So when I say that with the black belt,

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.280
the black belt has no control over the whole movement.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.440
He's thinking beginning and end.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.920
So he goes straight to your, you know, straight to your neck.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.920
Regardless, he cannot read the other person.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.600
If it's, you know, if it's time to let go,

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.880
if it's the time to go for a neck,

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.280
should I be pushing here before I get my hand in?

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.400
You know, is this the right time to go deep

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.280
or should I deal with this first before the second hand?

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.120
That's at the beginning.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.800
So it's at the white belt.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.640
At the very beginning of the journey.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:44.320
Yeah, the white belt, you just think, finish.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.160
Yeah.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.360
And then as you get progressed,

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:53.080
you see that there's like this giant tree of possibilities

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.040
that you're almost feeling your way down.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.080
I mean, would you be able to teach?

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.480
Do you even know what you're doing?

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.800
By the details.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.840
Okay.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.680
But it's hard to convert into words probably.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.840
No.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.680
That's possible.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:10.560
Then you don't know what you're doing.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.400
Okay.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.360
So what is some most important details

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.080
that you could say maybe positioning of the hand,

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.960
the gripping, is it the positioning of your body,

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.800
the posture?

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.200
Is there some interesting insights that people understand?

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:31.120
It's a combination because first you have to put your body

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.560
in a very strong position

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.920
that you don't require your hands to hold them out.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.520
So the choke is that that's first

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.320
because I cannot use my hands on the floor

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.760
to stop you escaping.

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.600
Yeah.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.640
So if I had to, my body has to handle that.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.240
The way I position myself,

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.480
I have to do it in a way that don't require my hands

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.440
for balance.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.280
Okay.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.320
Why is the mouth such a dominant position?

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.560
It doesn't make any sense, right?

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.000
Like you're just sitting on top of the stomach of a person.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:15:59.840
It makes all sense.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.720
If you think what's, forget fighting, forget Jiu-Jitsu.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.400
Like you've never trained.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.360
What's the one position, the most dominant position

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.480
you can get over another human being?

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.320
One.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.640
The most.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.480
For you, which one it is?

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:19.800
Like the most dominant position

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.680
that you can get over another human being.

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.920
So if we were just,

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.760
cause the way I think about it is

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.960
putting myself in like a six, seven, eight year old self

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.920
without knowing any martial arts

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.640
and I had an older brother who beat the shit out of me.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.080
Yeah, it probably was Mount.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.000
What?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
But, well, yes.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:42.840
Okay.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.680
So we both didn't know.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.440
But if we knew something, it'd probably be back control.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.640
If in the back control you're under the other person,

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.840
you think being under is the most dominant position

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.440
that can be over another person?

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.680
You mean like a back control?

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.880
If I'm on your back.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.720
Oh, like that.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.800
You can move, you can roll.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.000
I cannot stop you rolling.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.280
Yeah.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.000
Maybe you can even stand up.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.480
How dominant is that?

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.240
Yeah, but if we're the same size, both untrained.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.840
If, it doesn't matter.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.680
Have you seen kids, do they do that?

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.080
Okay.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.400
Mount looks and feels like dominance

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.840
when you're two eight year olds fighting.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.680
Okay.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.520
I don't know.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.360
I don't know why it feels that way.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.960
It could be some animalistic thing.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.240
Maybe it is actual dominance.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.080
I don't know.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.760
But it feels like if you're untrained,

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.720
you can just buck your way out of it.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.920
It feels unstable.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.800
It feels unstable to hold Mount

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.200
unless you know what you're doing.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.040
Right?

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:33.880
No?

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.600
If you're Mount, you put both of your hands on the floor.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.440
Yeah.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:37.760
Just your hands.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.320
To think it's easy to take somebody off.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.520
Yeah, maybe not.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.760
To think it's easy to remove the hand and bring them out.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.760
The hands on the floor.

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:46.600
Arms straight.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.040
I'm leaning in.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:48.880
Yeah, you're right.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.080
It's hard.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.360
I mean, you don't need to know fighting

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.000
to hold yourself there.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.080
Yeah.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.160
But you're right.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.200
When you take the arms off and balancing,

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.880
then it gets tricky.

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.000
Because when you're trying to...

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.440
I think what happens,

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.520
I'm thinking back to eight year old.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.680
Because my brother's five years older than me

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.240
and he would do the usual, like,

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.520
stop hitting yourself thing.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.840
And I think he would be in Mount,

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.560
like hitting me with my own hands.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.320
From out of place of love, of course.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.160
I love him deeply and it was very formative

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.160
and a positive experience for me.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.400
Okay.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:26.480
I think, yeah, the weakness is when he takes...

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.880
Well, when the person who has you Mount

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.400
takes their arms off to do something.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.480
But even if you keep your hands up in the air,

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.040
when I'm falling...

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:36.880
Yeah, you can.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:38.720
When I'm falling, so...

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.920
I'm speaking about untrained people.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.640
I feel like they get greedy.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.920
They try to do stuff.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.160
The other day I watched my nine-year-old daughter.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.000
Yeah.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.880
When I'm in a friend's house.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.040
There's a whole bunch of kids there.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.320
They're playing.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.120
And when I looked,

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.120
she's mounting a boy, her age, her size.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:57.600
He cannot escape.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.520
Wow, she probably has seen some footage.

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:00.360
No, she trains.

01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.640
She's been training for, I'll say, a year and a half.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.480
Okay.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.320
But she's not much.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.160
I mean, she's a nine-year-old daughter,

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.880
a girl over a boy.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.040
Has she seen footage of you?

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:08.880
Maybe she picked up from that.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:11.360
No, but she's been training for a year and a half.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.680
So she has an idea of what a mount is.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.680
But, I mean, in terms of our skills,

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.080
I never taught her the mount.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.480
She has, you know, she had lessons at the academy,

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.040
like any other kid.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.280
Did she make him cry, or?

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.600
No, but he couldn't escape.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:32.200
Which other position would she be able to hold the boy?

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.120
In the back, he would roll her out.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:35.960
That's true.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.520
Like, he couldn't come out from underneath her.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.960
They're kids.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.160
There is no other most dominant position

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.640
that you can pin the other person.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.120
Couldn't you argue, from that perspective, side control?

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.040
No.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:48.880
No?

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.840
Because side control, you have to hold the other person.

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.800
And you're not free.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.880
You cannot release them.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:00.800
But in side control, your hips are not on top of theirs.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:05.160
So they can't buck you off, right?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.120
If you're holding them a little bit,

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.960
and then you can hit them with one hand.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.200
But his head is here.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.520
You're gonna hurt him here.

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.760
By the time you're doing that,

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.600
but then he has his arms free.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.000
And if you turn towards your legs,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.720
then he's away from your arms.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.960
You don't even have the perfect angle.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.320
I mean, it is a good position.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.440
You can hit, you can dominate,

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:32.440
but it's not the best position to be over the other person.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.640
He can knee you in the head.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.640
At the same time you punch him,

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.640
then there's a knee coming to your head.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:40.440
I love playing devil's advocate with Roger Gracie

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.880
about two eight-year-olds fighting.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.360
And your head is closer to his head?

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.200
Yeah.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.080
Maybe he can throw you a punch?

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:48.920
All right.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.080
Would you choose to be in side control over mount?

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.160
Getting in the head?

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.480
Well, for a person who in competition

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.600
prefers knee on belly over mount,

01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.600
but that's my weakness.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.920
That's my failure as a human being.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.040
Holding mount can be tricky.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.720
It's very hard.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.440
Of course it's hard.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.720
But what is easy?

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.560
Tell me easy.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.160
Side control and knee on belly is easier,

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.040
but to submit. Knee on belly is easy.

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.120
Easier.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.760
I'm not saying black belt level.

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.880
I'm saying, well, maybe even black belt level.

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.840
Easy for what?

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.800
To hold somebody?

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.200
To make them squirm and hurt,

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.040
to create openings.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.880
Yeah, but go do that with a big guy.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.760
Yeah, you can't.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:29.600
You can't.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.920
Yeah.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.840
He's gonna push you back and come up in the mount.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.360
He can't sit up.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:36.800
Not when he mounted him.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.120
The thing is also about mount

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:41.240
is people on the bottom of mount panic more.

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.600
So they fight harder.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.440
Of course they panic.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.840
They're exposed.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.880
It's the most exposure you have

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.800
because the person's arms are free.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.560
You cannot touch him.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:54.080
His head is too high.

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.880
There's nothing he can do.

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.680
His legs won't get you anywhere.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.040
He might touch your lower back.

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.680
It's like nothing.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:04.000
You're most exposed being in the mount.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.440
I rarely, you hold me side control a thousand times

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.120
the amount of me having to look up

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.840
for your face come down on me.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.680
Yeah.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:13.760
Side control, I hug you.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.760
You cannot hurt me.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.040
Okay, hold me, but I'm hugging you.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:22.040
If I hug you tight, what can you do against me?

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:22.880
Hold.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.760
It seems maybe it's just from,

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.360
and again, I'm arguing just for the fun of it,

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:33.360
but it seems like a more difficult skill

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:37.520
to learn to apply a huge amount of pressure

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.240
and weight from a mount.

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:41.800
You don't have to apply pressure and weight from a mount?

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.200
Not apply pressure, but be heavy, right?

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.880
You don't necessarily need to be heavy.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.720
You don't?

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.640
No.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:53.360
Why do you, as people say, you feel extremely heavy?

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.200
If I'm putting, if I'm being heavy, I cannot attack.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.520
Got it.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.800
I have to choose.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:04.800
I can be heavy just to, you know, just to pin them,

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.480
take the energy out, you know, to make them suffer.

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.760
But the moment that I decide to attack,

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.560
I can only be heavy if I'm sitting up straight.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.960
That's when my, all my weight can drops down.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:18.280
If I'm high, then I'm sitting on your chest

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.120
and on your solar plexus.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.040
That's the worst position to be seated on the person

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.600
because that's where he breathes.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.000
So you're in a high mount, sitting up straight.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.760
That's when you can, I can be very heavy.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.880
I can make people, you know, feel my weight and, you know,

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.800
be very uncomfortable, but I'm not in a position to attack.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.760
The moment that I want to attack,

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:38.640
my body has to lean forward.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.680
I have to approach the, you know, the neck or the arms.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.080
The moment that I do that, my weight comes off my hips.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.120
It goes to my knees.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.920
The weight is off you.

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.640
But at that point, if you have...

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:52.600
Now I'm attacking, I'm no longer heavy on you.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.160
But you want to be at that point to remove any of the

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.280
defenses they have or some of the defenses

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.560
by getting their elbows.

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.520
Now I'm like either getting, trying to get your collar

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.800
or bringing your elbow across to attack the armlock.

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.840
So what are some interesting details along the way

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.440
that are tough to get to figure out?

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.120
What were the big leaps for you from white belt

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.320
to the best in the world?

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.680
It's, you're trying to attack the neck, you know,

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.280
putting one hand in the collar.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.360
You're priving yourself that hand to pace it on the floor.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.840
So now you're vulnerable to get breached, to get rollover.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.080
Because if your hands are free trying to roll you over,

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.200
you're stopped.

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.720
The moment that you put your hand in the person's collar,

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:33.120
now you have to be very careful with your body positioning.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:33.960
Very careful.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.120
The distribution of the weight.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.200
Yeah, and how, you know, how high you sit, you know,

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.240
how tall your upper body goes.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.520
And then the biggest challenge comes as you're trying

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:45.360
the second hand.

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.560
That's the, you know, for the choke,

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:50.200
that's the biggest challenge, the second hand.

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.120
Because you already have, you know,

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.120
you already don't have one hand.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.160
Now you are trying the second hand.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.120
And if one of my hand is in,

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:05.120
you as defending yourself have two hands.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.280
One hand is already on one side.

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.520
This side is getting attacked.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.640
You have two hands blocking that.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.920
I have one hand.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.920
There's no help for that hand.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.920
I cannot remove anything.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.880
That's the biggest challenge.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.280
Getting one hand getting past two

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.880
and not getting rollover.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.040
But I also have two hands on bottom.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.760
I have two hands and can also turn

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.640
and do all kinds of stuff.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.880
And my whole mind and everything is focused

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.800
on that second hand.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.760
It's a big challenge.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.640
It's hard, very hard.

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.080
Is there an art to getting the first hand

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.040
into a place where you...

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.000
It's less of an art because it's easier.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.160
I'll say most times I get my first hand in

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.200
is when you're trying some move.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.640
You're trying to escape, you're pushing.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.680
I get the first hand in as an opportunity.

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:59.200
And it's gonna sit there for a while.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.280
And I go as deep as I can.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.640
So the first hand,

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.880
because the second hand is the hardest,

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.520
I have to compensate the first hand

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.600
to be as deep as I can.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.360
If I cannot get the first hand in deep,

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.320
I won't try the second.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.040
I need that first hand deep,

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:15.880
then I go for the second.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:18.600
And it's deep and everything is like super tight?

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.680
Super tight.

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.560
The first hand has to be super tight.

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.680
Otherwise, the chance of failing is very big.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:25.520
Okay.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.960
Does the opponent usually feel like

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:28.320
they're screwed at that point also?

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.720
Not as you put in the first hand in.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.560
The moment that I position myself

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.320
just prior to attempt the second hand,

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.840
I think the way my body is positioned,

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.280
the way I'm collapsing with my weight

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.960
and they feel it's like,

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.520
this is terrible.

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.040
Yeah, how long did it take you to figure out

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.600
how to reposition your weight once the first hand is in?

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.920
Very quickly.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.920
Because do I get breached out?

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:54.760
Okay.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:56.160
So that there's a good feedback loop there.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.480
Because one mistake you're out.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.520
Like one off positioning you out.

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:03.400
But you still have to do that

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:04.800
against the best people in the world.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.640
Yeah.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:07.720
Where's the way out for most people?

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.840
Like if you were in Mount against Buccecce

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.840
or some of the best defenses in the world.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.040
The way out is to,

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.720
I mean, obviously is to defend themselves

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.000
and prevent the first hand to get deep.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.800
And I'll say the best thing that they could do

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:31.520
is try to change my positioning on the Mount

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.120
in a way that push me to a very low mount.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:38.000
Try to change the way I'm dominating you

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.160
not to be, get me off the high mount pretty much.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.800
Are you always, is it a slow, is it a fast thing

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.640
to go from low to fast?

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.960
Slow, slow, slow, slow.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:46.800
A high mount.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.720
Slow, very slow.

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.280
Because I need to beat your arms

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.400
because you're holding me down.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.000
And the arms need to come out.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.160
It's a slow, it's a slow process.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.000
Okay.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.800
And you just, is there like a...

01:27:56.800 --> 01:27:57.640
Yeah.

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.360
It's so I use my legs against your arms.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.640
So it's my legs pushing your arms.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.560
But how do you get them,

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:07.040
how do you get your legs into the elbows?

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.920
As long as it's, you know,

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.040
it has to come under the tip of your elbow.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.080
Cause now the legs will start forcing your arms up.

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.000
So your legs aren't like spread out there.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:16.840
No.

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.440
Your elbow cannot get inside my leg.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.920
Because that means I'm in a very low mount.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.280
And then I cannot attack.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:26.800
Cause I cannot ignore that.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.080
Cause the moment that I attack,

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.120
that will, you will start pushing my leg to push me up.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.640
What's the secret to getting the second hand in?

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.040
There's two ways.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.680
Either you go four fingers inside,

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.240
which is the hardest because with the moment

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.880
that your two hands are defending,

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:46.640
you'll be blocking the, you know, the way.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:50.760
And I cannot clear and attack two hands against one.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:54.240
So I go thumb in, I go behind the ear.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.080
Yep.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:58.560
So my grip goes, because for you to defend,

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.120
you need to get there.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:00.960
Yep.

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.000
And when you get there, you elevate your elbow,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.160
you expose the arm lock.

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.160
So it's hard.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.880
So you put the thumb in, and then there's the dreaded,

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.600
like the other person just waits for you

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.680
to loop the arm over.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.200
Yeah, but that, that's over.

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.360
It's, once you get the thumb in, it's over.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.200
Okay.

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:25.480
No, but when I'm there, it's, if I get the,

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.760
cause they're bridging, you know, they try,

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.040
I'm not using their hand to post.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.520
Now your head is-

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.920
My head is very close to the floor.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.400
When I've tried to bridge and, you know,

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.600
my forehead would touch the floor,

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.760
that would be used as a hand.

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.000
But it's not on the floor?

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Not necessarily.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.720
Because if it's on the floor, my body's collapse over you.

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.760
So there's no place for my hand,

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.840
for me to work on your neck.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.840
So I need some space between us.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:49.960
So I don't completely collapse.

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.280
So maybe you can bob up and down.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.320
Yeah, yeah, but I try to keep a gap between us.

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:55.160
Okay.

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:00.000
So that pursuit that takes many, many, many, many years,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.520
I don't know if you've seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi,

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:07.080
the doing the simple thing,

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.720
that's not so simple, but it kind of looks simple,

01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:11.560
of the over and over and over and over and over,

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:13.400
and presumably getting much better with time.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.240
It becomes very simple.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.440
But you're picking up details probably along the way.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.320
There's wisdom along the way.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.160
What is that?

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:24.480
Is that there's like lessons

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.080
that you just kind of accumulate over time.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.960
Like one training session, you'll see maybe

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.280
like the positioning of the thumb,

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.360
like this detailed positioning of the thumb,

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.440
or something like this.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.320
And then you like, okay, you like load that in.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.520
That will be very basic

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.000
because there is not that many different ways.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.120
Maybe one, two, I just do one.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.560
Any other is not as strong

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:55.880
because it's about getting a strong grip on your collar.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.080
I mean, the thumb goes inside,

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.840
is it the thumb in or four fingers in,

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.680
but it's getting a strong grip on the collar

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:09.400
as long as it's just holding and feeling strong.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.520
So that's just two options.

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.200
So it's the dynamic stuff along the way.

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:16.040
And then sometimes timing too.

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.040
It's timing.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.280
Are you also like making people,

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.400
like faking them out,

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.760
making them think about something else?

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:22.920
No, not at that point.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.800
That's not, because I cannot fake anything else

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.320
at that point because I will have to change my positioning

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:32.880
to maybe to fake an armlock.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.200
Then I have to move out from that.

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.600
So then I will lose the control I have.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.640
So what's the process towards mastery?

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:41.160
If you were to convert that to something

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.640
that generalizes beyond jiu-jitsu,

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:47.640
how can you get that good at a simple thing?

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.480
Practice.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.760
That simple.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.480
The same exact thing over and over.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.760
It's just a matter of how long will take you.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:00.720
So all, that's true, that's true.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.920
I mean, like I said, look how long it took me.

01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:05.360
People give up along the way.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:11.360
There is intricacies to that journey towards perfection.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:15.840
There's a lot of people that do jiu-jitsu for decades

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.400
and don't get better.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.320
No, because they don't train the way they should.

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.440
They don't train to get better.

01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:22.080
They train to get tough.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.760
That's a big difference.

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.360
Most people, they train to get tough.

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.120
So they are tough.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.760
Like we were talking before,

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.400
they don't practice the weakness.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.480
You want to be good at,

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:34.000
you want to be really good at jiu-jitsu.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.720
You have to practice your weakness, not your strength.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:39.880
You have to practice everything,

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.600
but you have to be equally strong in every position.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.360
They're all exactly the same.

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.320
You know, your guard top-bottom,

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:51.320
side control top-bottom, turtle, half guard, mount, back.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.320
I mean, you pick, take down.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:59.040
And then you get into details of escaping triangle,

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:03.160
applying the triangle, escaping armlock,

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.520
different scenarios of, you know,

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.440
it's the one thing is defending the armlock

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.560
when you have your arms very close to your body.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:13.000
The other thing is to defend the arms

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.760
when your arm is almost getting,

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.560
and then when he got your arm.

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.560
So there's so many things to practice

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.000
that you need to repeat them over and over again

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.360
until you're confident enough

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.400
that when you get there, you have a chance.

01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.640
And you can do the same kind of thing

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:32.040
for even the final stages of a cross choke from mount.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:32.880
Everything.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.840
I mean, of course, like you don't practice

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.560
escaping the armlock with a full arm straight

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.600
because, you know, that's gone.

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.080
I mean, you practice, you know,

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:48.480
you practice escaping the armlock when he takes your arm,

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.280
you have, you know, you have a chance of trying to escape,

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.600
but you don't practice.

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.080
You know, okay, take my arm.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.120
When I say go, go, I mean, you got, you know,

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.760
you pop the arm.

01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.960
That is like you get injured doing that.

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.400
Escaping the cross collar choke,

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.920
it's, I mean, escape not letting the person get there.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.320
You can escape, you can practice escaping triangles

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.320
because, you know, it's like it's,

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.360
you have a way better chance of escaping triangle

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.960
than, okay, mount on me, put both hands in my neck.

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:21.200
I mean, it's over, you know, don't be there.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.520
What's the best submission in jiu-jitsu?

01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:25.240
A choke, I would say.

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.440
From which position?

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.280
I would.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:34.400
If I gave you a billion dollars to start in a position,

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.480
like in a submission, and you only get the billion,

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.680
if you get the submission, which one would you start?

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.040
Cross collar choke in the mouth.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.240
Cross collar choke in the mouth.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.360
Not from the back.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:49.160
No, you have a better chance escaping from the back.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.320
Really?

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.160
Yeah.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.000
Even with the hooks?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:53.840
Even with everything.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.000
Do you think some people will disagree with you?

01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.360
I don't care.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.200
I have a better escape.

01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.440
I have a better chance escaping from the back

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.000
than if you mount on me, put my hands on my neck.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.880
So, if you were facing yourself,

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.000
and I will give you a billion dollars to escape,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.280
you would pick?

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.560
From the back.

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.080
Thousand times over.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.560
Like, no comparison.

01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:17.000
You have like, with hooks, with like a triangle?

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:17.960
It doesn't matter.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:19.320
You can do whatever you want.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.280
Like a body triangle?

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:21.520
Okay.

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.720
Okay.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:23.560
Really?

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.400
Thousand times over.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.240
Like, no questions.

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.240
To do the mount is a super controlling position.

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:28.080
It's not just.

01:35:29.200 --> 01:35:31.880
Because cross collar choke in the mouth,

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.680
the moment that you put both hands on my neck,

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:34.640
you know, you have to,

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.200
your arms needs to be very close to your body to attack.

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:41.400
So that means there's very little space between us.

01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:45.120
So that means there's very little escape space

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.160
for you to work on your escape.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.400
And the moment that you cannot bridge,

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.760
let's suppose I have, you know,

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.840
the person has a good mouth,

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.360
so you cannot bridge him off.

01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.200
What else?

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:58.040
You don't have space to try to work on your defense.

01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.520
Being in the back,

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.600
I have all this space around me

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.920
to work on my defense and my arms.

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:06.360
I have the mobility to bring them anywhere.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:09.480
So I, because of that,

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.560
he gives you and me a much better chance.

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:16.480
And you cannot, I can move my body.

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.120
If you feel my back, you cannot pin me.

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.760
I cannot take you off my back.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:25.480
First, I need to defend the choke,

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.640
but you have no control over my body.

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:29.960
So that means there's still a lot of movement

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:32.920
that I can try to use to escape.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.680
In the mount, there's no movement.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:36.840
I'm pinned down, I cannot move,

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:39.960
and I have no space between us to escape.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:42.760
Well, the argument against that, this is great,

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:45.200
is that on the bottom of mount,

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.160
I do have my hands between,

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.840
so you're saying they're pinned, there's nothing.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:51.680
Between where?

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.760
I mean, you could get them in theory.

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.200
You could somehow, you could.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.680
But there's no, you can't, but then there's no space.

01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:00.600
They will be squeezed between our bodies.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.160
If it's an incredible mount.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.360
No, it does not mount.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:08.320
Like how standing, if I put both hands on your neck,

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.520
if I'm gonna go for the cross collar choke,

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:12.040
after I get my hands in,

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:14.320
the next step is to pull you close to me.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.360
So it's this, my arms needs to be close to me.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.000
But I can put, there's the hands that could do something.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.440
They can't come in,

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.800
but there's a very limited space between us.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.200
No, I mean, to push your body away,

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.800
to decrease the politics. Only if we're standing,

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.840
not if your back is against the floor.

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.280
Okay, the argument against the mount is,

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.520
or the argument for back controls

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.160
being the most dominant position,

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.640
is even though I have hands,

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.480
I can't really use them effectively, as effective.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.040
Not in the mount.

01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.680
There's no space. In the mount, there's no space.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:45.840
There's no space.

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.280
You can try.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.720
I mean, you can squeeze your hand in.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.720
I mean, there's still things that you could do,

01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:53.200
but they're so limited.

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.200
So if you polled the 100 best competitors of all time,

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.760
what do you think they would answer to that?

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.760
Do you think most would agree with you?

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.120
I don't care.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.720
You will show me their skills, their ability to see.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.200
Okay, so the perfect mount

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.880
versus the perfect back control.

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:17.720
There's no question.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:19.000
Okay, there's no question.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.360
For me.

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.960
I mean, argue with me, like, show me.

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.160
Because I'm not being stubborn, because I'm being-

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.000
Scientific.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.320
Exactly.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.320
So explain it to me why the back, it would be harder,

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.080
it would be better to your position to finish the mount.

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:41.080
If you can explain it to me why, I might change my mind.

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:45.960
I was trying to, but I don't have the cred.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.720
I'm like a middle school science student

01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.360
trying to talk to Einstein here.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:54.280
Okay.

01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.680
Besides you, who do you think is the greatest

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.560
Jiu-Jitsu competitor of all time?

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.840
Can you make the case for some of them?

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:06.920
Marcelo, Bushesha, Leandro Lowe.

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.720
I'll have to go with Bushesha,

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:11.280
because look at how many titles he has.

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.160
I mean, he has by far more than Marcelo.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.520
Marcelo stopped quite early.

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:21.360
Leandro Lowe has eight, but Bushesha is better than him.

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:23.960
What do you think makes Bushesha so good?

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:26.640
He's a heavyweight that moves like a lightweight.

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.240
He moves very fast, but he's very agile for his size.

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.480
So the agility combined with aggression.

01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:36.320
Yeah.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:41.320
So he's very hard to control him, because he moves fast

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.920
and he's 112 kilos, 115 sometimes, or 110.

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:48.240
I'm not sure, but he's around that.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.680
So 240 in pounds.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:55.280
So when you're agile, 240 pounds,

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:58.000
that makes it very hard to control you.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.080
What about making the case for some others?

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.000
What about the little guys?

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.920
What about Marcelo, if you were to make the case

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.240
for him being the strongest?

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.960
What makes Marcelo good?

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:08.160
Marcelo Garcia is extremely technical.

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.480
I mean, I think he's one of my favorite Jiu-Jitsu fighters,

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.880
because in a technical way,

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.400
I think he's probably one of the best.

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:21.040
His raw technique and a bunch of different positions

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:21.880
for submissions.

01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:25.640
He's not very powerful.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.720
Physically, he's not very strong,

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:29.760
but he can make himself very strong

01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:32.160
and his technique is very, very high level.

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.200
Have you ever trained with him?

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.400
No, I fought him twice.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:36.240
Yeah.

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.400
But he's much smaller than me.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.840
What happened in those matches?

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:44.280
The first fight, I tapped him, I think, five minutes.

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.400
In which submission?

01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:47.040
Choke from the back.

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.400
Collar choke from the back.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.160
And the second time I beat him by points,

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:54.760
but a very large, I think 12-2.

01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.240
Actually, just to continue,

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.720
I wonder if John Donahue would agree with you

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.200
about mountain back.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.320
I can't wait to, this is a bear versus lion conversation.

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:10.880
I'm looking, there's statistics about,

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:13.800
I'm not letting this go.

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:15.360
There's statistics about,

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.960
oh, look at that, Hodger.

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:19.840
What do you know?

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.880
Looking at Hodger Gracie's statistics

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.800
for most successful submissions.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.800
Choke from the back is the most.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:30.280
So how do you explain that, Mr. Scientist?

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.720
Because people panic when I'm out.

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.800
They turn the back, I choke them out.

01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.720
That's one explanation.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.640
Well, for people, it is interesting that,

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:39.960
of course, this doesn't capture,

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:42.600
but this captures a lot of your major matches.

01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.960
And we should say that

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.880
you've submitted most of your opponents,

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.400
so you rarely win on points.

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:49.560
You usually win submissions.

01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:52.440
Choke from back is most of them,

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.160
then cross choke from mount.

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.520
Arm bar is a lot, too.

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:59.200
So 18 from choke from back, 12 cross choke,

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.120
10 arm bar, five RNC rear naked is for no gi.

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.040
Okay.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.040
Ezekiel.

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.600
Ezekiel is very powerful.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.920
I choke out using, it's a strong weapon.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.400
Yeah, also from mount.

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.240
Also from mount.

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:16.000
Oh, that's when you can't get the one hand in.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.200
No, because the Ezekiel most times I use against people

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:25.200
is the attack that as soon as I get to the mount,

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.480
when they're trying to escape the open up,

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:28.520
and I get them.

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:31.880
It has to be at that initial timing.

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:34.200
So it's not a thing you use to bother them

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.240
in order to create.

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.880
Either I get it right away or I don't bother trying much.

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:39.720
Got it.

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.760
Because you need to keep one hand behind the head,

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:46.120
and you're naturally on that position

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:48.320
as soon as you mount most of the times.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.520
And the moment that you mount someone,

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.920
no one accept that they go mounted,

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:53.280
they're gonna explode to get out.

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.440
So holding the head, it gives you a better way

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.800
to dominate them initially,

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.440
to deal with that explosiveness on the initial,

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:04.840
on the beginning.

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:07.320
And then, but then you have to let go to try it.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:09.240
You're very limited holding the head.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.560
In terms of goats, Shanji,

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:17.680
I feel like he doesn't get enough credit that he deserves.

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.800
He had an extremely dominant performance in competition.

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:23.120
What about Salo and Shanji Hibero?

01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.600
What are your thoughts about what makes them so good?

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.160
You had a bunch of tough matches with Shanji and Salo.

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.000
Eight times.

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.160
Yeah, for eight times, Shanji.

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.520
I fought Salo once.

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:38.160
What?

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.400
I think I'm bringing up a sore point.

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:45.440
Oh, did Shanji tap when you,

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.760
or did the time run out,

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.000
and that was the last time you guys faced each other?

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.440
Yeah, 2008.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.680
That was incredible to watch.

01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:55.520
Also,

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:59.080
I think you pulled guard with one minute left

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:01.040
working towards attacking.

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.600
I mean, it's probably very tough to get anything.

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:07.160
And for people who don't know, time ran out.

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:10.560
You had something that looked like an arm lock,

01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:15.000
and Shanji looked like he may be tapping,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.320
but it looked like he might be just celebrating,

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:18.160
which is most likely.

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:19.000
I'm not sure.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:19.840
I'm not sure.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.720
It was, I'm not sure.

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:24.160
I'm not sure, because

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.960
I think his arm was just,

01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:30.360
just straight his arm time finish.

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:33.960
So I'm not sure if he was tapping to let go,

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.240
time is up, or, because I would say,

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.640
most likely the time was up.

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.480
Yeah, and also, there's a thing where you start,

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:45.040
you realize there's only three, two seconds left.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.080
You just kind of start celebrating.

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.800
You realize that Hajji's not gonna be able

01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:52.520
to finish this arm bar in the time left,

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.160
so you start celebrating.

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:56.720
No, I think he tapped to say the time is up.

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:57.880
The time is up.

01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.320
Anyway, what do you think,

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:03.840
like the longevity especially is impressive with Shanji?

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.680
How long?

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:08.000
I think he doesn't get credit as much as he deserves,

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.400
because he pushed his career very far.

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.960
And the last few years, he was on his best.

01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:21.160
So he's, if he were to stop before,

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:25.280
you would, people would remember him on his highest,

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:30.280
but he kind of pushed more than his peak, let's say.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:35.920
How hard is it for you to walk away?

01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:38.600
We'll talk about the journey into MMA as well,

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:41.600
but you basically, especially with the second match

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:45.160
against Buccesi, basically walked away on top,

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:50.080
beating arguably the greatest competitor of all time.

01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.240
And just walking away.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.040
It wasn't that hard, to be honest,

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.960
because that was something that I was considering

01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:03.280
for a while, because the last few years of my career,

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.440
let's say, it was fighting MMA at the same time

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.280
I was fighting Jiu-Jitsu,

01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:11.280
and it's very challenging to do both.

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:15.280
Like I don't, there's not another person who ever did that,

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:18.120
because the training is a confliction

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.840
with the way you train.

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.720
Everybody who start doing MMA, start focusing on MMA,

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:26.400
their Jiu-Jitsu gets worse,

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.720
because they stop training with the gi.

01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.880
Everybody, no exception.

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:33.520
Was your Jiu-Jitsu also getting worse?

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.200
No, because I made sure I kept training with the gi,

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:40.760
and I kept fighting at least the world championship

01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.920
once a year.

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.760
That was my goal.

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:44.800
I'm like, I'm gonna go for MMA,

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.960
but I love Jiu-Jitsu and I still wanna fight

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:49.520
at the highest level.

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:53.080
So I kept fighting once a year for a few years.

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:57.960
It was a challenge, especially because the two or three times

01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.960
when I competed at the Worlds,

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.520
it was right after MMA fight I had.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:07.720
And no gi, you don't have the grips.

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.160
So my grips, it made a big difference on my grip.

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.560
So I was weaker grip wise.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.400
So I felt that.

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:18.440
So I knew it was like, it's unnecessary risk,

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.480
because if I cannot be 100%, so why am I doing this?

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:24.040
But I'm stubborn.

01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.080
I love Jiu-Jitsu.

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.040
That's like, I love fighting Jiu-Jitsu.

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:30.440
I never loved MMA.

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.200
I've liked it, but I think if it were Gracie,

01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.600
I wouldn't have done it.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.280
So the thing you felt the most is the grips.

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.120
Yeah.

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:46.400
Could you win a gi world championship without gripping?

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:47.560
No.

01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:49.800
Just pretending it's no gi match,

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.760
they get to grip you, but you don't.

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:52.600
No.

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.440
So grips are essential.

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.280
Of course.

01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.040
I mean, how can you choke someone?

01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:00.760
If your grips are weak, your forearms will fatigue,

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:02.640
and then you will have no power,

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:04.400
and then you cannot do anything.

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.520
Yeah.

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.160
You could still arm lock.

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.880
So I meant more not for the submission,

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.000
but for the control of the game of it, the dance.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.320
But you need to grip to get there.

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:16.800
To get there.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:18.680
I mean, if your grips are weak.

01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.640
But you also have grips in no gi.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.080
Can she use those grips?

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:22.920
No.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.000
This is a thought experiment.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.120
So I'm trying to understand how essential.

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:30.080
When I get a no gi guy go fight with a gi, they panic.

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:30.920
They panic?

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:31.760
Of course.

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:32.600
Everyone panics.

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.640
A bear panics when they're in the water with a shark,

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:36.880
but that doesn't mean the bear can't still win

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:39.400
when it stops panicking and relaxes.

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.400
It's not possible.

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.880
Oh, that's another discussion.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:44.800
Can a bear beat a shark in the water?

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:48.600
Actually, I need to, maybe a polar bear,

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.840
because they're pretty good at swimming.

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:50.680
Okay.

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:53.440
I say not possible for the no gi guy to win.

01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:55.440
But the bear is a further discussion.

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.240
What was to you the biggest difference

01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:02.280
between mixed martial arts and jujitsu?

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.640
What are some interesting differences,

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:04.960
some interesting insights,

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:07.440
even just about the grappling within both sports?

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.760
So the biggest difference for me,

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:13.160
between MMA and jujitsu,

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.040
is first is the speed.

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.440
Like jujitsu, like a 10 minute match,

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.960
I can take my time.

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:24.040
There's no dangers that forces me to move fast.

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.280
MMA, you have to be 100% sharp and fast

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.480
from first second of the fight,

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:33.320
because punches are coming.

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:35.120
You can get knocked out anytime.

01:49:35.120 --> 01:49:37.600
One mistake, you're out.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.320
Jujitsu, you don't have that.

01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:42.400
Like it's, I don't have to worry about quick submissions,

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:46.000
because it's all about the way my body's positioned.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.640
My grips, it's easy to avoid,

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:49.040
it's easy to see it coming.

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:53.400
It's like a quick submission, a surprise.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.840
It only works if you make a mistake,

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:59.080
if you're not correct positioning.

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:00.560
Otherwise it's impossible.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.360
It's extremely difficult.

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.120
MMA is not.

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:07.880
I mean, one split second mistake,

01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:12.320
and when the person comes, you have to respond.

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:14.400
You have to match his pace.

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.720
I mean, you can slow down,

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.040
but it's like you're forced to respond.

01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:19.880
So it's much faster.

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:23.920
It's a lot more physical, a lot more.

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.920
And you need to be physical,

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.000
much better conditioning, faster.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.720
It's explosiveness.

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:31.760
It's much harder.

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:36.080
Is it possible in the MMA to calm things down?

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.920
If they change the rules, yeah.

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:39.080
Five minute rules, no.

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.920
Ah, I see.

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:45.480
I just meant, actually, technically speaking,

01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:48.600
is there a way to take an opponent

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.160
that's being exceptionally aggressive?

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:51.440
You can, clinch.

01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:52.280
Clinch.

01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:54.520
But then he takes you down, he keeps moving.

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.720
Something is hard to control that pace.

01:50:58.960 --> 01:50:59.800
You can.

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:03.360
If you play defense, you save more energy

01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:06.280
than if you try to be the aggressor and respond.

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:08.040
And even getting to the clinch is very difficult.

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:11.520
Yeah, you have no way to hold yourself there.

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:13.880
So that was the biggest challenge for me in MMA,

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:14.960
is the speed.

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:17.800
Because I'm a very slow start fighter.

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:20.280
If you look at my matches, I start very slow.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:24.280
Because if I go hard, I fatigue faster.

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:27.000
So for me, that was the hardest part,

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.200
is to start fast.

01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:31.200
What about on the ground?

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:33.520
Is there something different,

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.400
more challenging on the ground?

01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.720
Being in the bottom, yes.

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:38.720
There's punches, punch coming.

01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:40.320
How fundamentally different is you just

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.480
with punches on the ground?

01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:44.400
It changes everything, everything.

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:45.360
Which parts?

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.680
The distance that you allow your opponent to be on you,

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:50.960
the techniques that you choose to apply.

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:57.760
Your body has to be aware of the punches

01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:01.480
and you are a lot more limited on your attacks.

01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:03.360
So you're known for your close guards.

01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.400
How does your close guard have to adjust?

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:07.960
How does the positioning of your hands have to adjust

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.440
when you're on the bottom of close guard?

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:12.400
So in the guard, especially in the close guard,

01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:15.800
you have to either keep the person very close to you

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.000
or you have to kick him away.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.680
In the guard, it's either I'm hugging you

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.160
or get away from him.

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:24.200
And in Jiu-Jitsu, you're allowed to have a middle?

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:27.600
Yeah, in Jiu-Jitsu, you can allow the person to be.

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:31.600
What about getting an arm lock

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:35.080
or triangle submissions from the guard?

01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.440
Is that fundamentally different?

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.840
Because you don't have the middle game?

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:41.880
It's much harder.

01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:47.160
There's barely no open guard in MMA, very little.

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:50.600
Because the open guard, there's a distance

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:52.160
between you and him.

01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:55.040
There's a distance you cannot control.

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.040
It's much harder to control that punch coming.

01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:01.680
And I have to position myself a way to block that.

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.360
And it limited my attacks, my options of attacks.

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:07.400
Is there a reason, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:09.880
but I don't think you do open guard much

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:12.360
in Jiu-Jitsu and Nogi.

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.320
Is there a reason for that?

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:19.320
It's harder with the explosive person

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.400
because when they're moving fast,

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.120
then you have to try to slow them down.

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:26.240
So you like guards that allow you to control the person?

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:27.080
Yeah.

01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:29.880
And close guard is the ultimate control?

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:30.720
Yeah.

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:32.680
It's not ultimate control,

01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.280
but close guard puts you in a position

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:36.840
that I'm attacking and you're defending.

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:39.040
You cannot attack me from my close guard.

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:43.200
We can argue that there's might be one or two attacks,

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:46.480
but it's like very, very, very limited

01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:50.080
and depends who you're fighting against.

01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:52.240
I hate the close guard.

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:55.240
Being on top against a good close guard is very-

01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:56.800
No one likes, it's terrible.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:57.640
It's horrible.

01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.040
It's one-sided.

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.080
So you're in the guard and it's one-sided.

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.920
The person at the bottom has the advantage.

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:05.920
I can be completely relaxed in my close guard

01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.520
and I cannot be completely relaxed.

01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:09.200
You know what the most annoying thing is?

01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.760
Is somebody who is both good

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.080
and extremely confident with a close guard

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:16.080
because they have that smug energy about them.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.800
They know how much unpleasant,

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.240
how much work it takes to pass this.

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:24.200
Anyway, especially people with longer legs.

01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.720
Is there something you wish you did differently

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:32.800
in how you started training at MMA in that trajectory

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:36.160
in figuring out how to train, how to get good?

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:38.400
What have you learned about getting good at MMA

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:40.520
from having done it?

01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.760
If you were to start now, for example?

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:46.360
I think I would have to dedicate it more.

01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:48.400
I didn't dedicate enough.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.200
Both like literally time, number of training sessions-

01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.040
Training, yeah.

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:52.860
But also mental-

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:53.960
Training wise, physical.

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:56.440
I think a lot more the physical part of it.

01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:57.480
The strikes, everything?

01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:58.880
The strike from the beginning.

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.720
It's because, I mean, I love Jiu-Jitsu.

01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:07.520
Like I truly love all the aspects of it.

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:12.000
Fighting, training, the practice, the competition.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.800
I don't have that for MMA.

01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:16.080
So it's hard to give your heart to it,

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.360
something that you don't have the passion to it.

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:21.960
Like Jiu-Jitsu, I gave my heart to it.

01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.400
Like I did everything that I had to.

01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:27.120
MMA, I never, I didn't do that.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:29.480
So that's why it was,

01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:34.600
I won't say it was wrong for me to do it

01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:36.640
because I don't regret doing it.

01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:40.120
I always, looking back as a kid,

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:44.760
when I decided to be, to take Jiu-Jitsu for life,

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:49.200
I already knew that some point I would have to do MMA.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.960
There's almost like, that's the path of a Gracie.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.360
When you're ready, you go do MMA.

01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:59.120
So there was like a duty versus a love.

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:00.920
Yeah, there was not a choice.

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.840
There was like, I have to.

01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:06.000
It's just the life I took, it will lead that way.

01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:09.760
Are you proud of that step?

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:13.240
You know, go against the natural love and towards more duty.

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:18.120
I think I don't regret it

01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:21.160
because if I hadn't done it,

01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.720
I would feel there was something missing.

01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.680
So I don't regret doing it.

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:28.280
I would regret not doing it.

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:33.560
The tricky thing is the choice to go to MMA

01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.040
could have compromised your ability

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.560
to win against Buchescha, and it didn't.

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:44.040
And it's a fascinating case study.

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.120
It still doesn't make sense to me.

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:48.360
After all those years, you're able to come back

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.680
and go against the best person in the world and beat him.

01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:56.960
And I had to, because the first fight we had,

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.760
I had something stuck in my throat for a long time.

01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:03.440
So you think about that.

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.440
Oh yeah, I'm like, as soon as that first fight finished,

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:11.400
I had something that got stuck in my throat

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.640
that I already, at that point I knew

01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:15.480
I'm gonna have to fight him again.

01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.760
I knew, I always knew.

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:20.760
If there's no choice, I have to.

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:22.280
Oh man.

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:26.120
All right, well, in terms of Nogi,

01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:29.440
who do you think is the best Nogi competitor of all time?

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:31.640
There's no question, you know, it's Gordon.

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.920
I don't think it's right to say the best

01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:39.440
competitor of all time, because he's still very young.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:41.280
I think that's something that he can't be arguing

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.400
in the end of when the person...

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:44.760
You don't want him to get lazy.

01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:45.600
You know what I'm saying?

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.480
No, I mean, but you cannot praise someone

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:49.280
in the middle of his career, you know?

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:52.280
So you cannot call him the best ever.

01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:54.560
He's 26 or 27.

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:56.560
So it's, I mean, he's great.

01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:58.000
He's very good.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000
He's ahead of all of other competitors, I think.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.440
And I mean, he's having an amazing career.

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:08.720
You know, he's doing amazingly well.

01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:13.080
So I mean, when he finished, when he finally retired,

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:15.120
then you can argue like...

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.160
You know what, there's wisdom in that.

01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:19.840
It matters how you finish, right?

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:20.680
Of course.

01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:21.800
It's very interesting.

01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:28.520
I think that Nogi is relatively new, that Nogi scene.

01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:31.400
That was not seen before.

01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.960
I think he started now on his generation, you know, his time.

01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:39.080
Because before, like, when I was competing,

01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:40.840
Nogi was just ADCC.

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.560
There's nothing else.

01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:45.640
Every two years, first was only in the Emirates.

01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.600
You know, you had to go there to compete.

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:49.960
So there was not even a scene.

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.000
There was like this one tournament

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.880
that gives a lot of money to,

01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:58.240
you know, to competitors, to fighters.

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.760
And brings fighters from other modalities.

01:59:00.760 --> 01:59:05.000
You know, Mark Carr, Van Arsdale, you know,

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.840
some wrestlers, Greco-Roman, you know,

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:10.800
they can compete against each other.

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:14.400
And they, you know, they create that set of rules,

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:16.480
try not to favor anyone.

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:17.920
So that was it.

01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:21.600
So you cannot be called the greatest Nogi of all time

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:25.520
if you only have one tournament every two years.

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:28.080
Only in the Emirates, they have to be invited to.

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:32.480
But I think now, you know, it grew a lot.

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:34.200
Now we have so many different tournaments.

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:35.040
Now we have a scene.

01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:36.920
You have people that only train Nogi.

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:39.320
They're fully dedicated to Nogi.

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:42.680
And you have supervised different tournaments.

01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:46.320
So now it's, you know, now it's professionally.

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.600
You can do just Nogi now,

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.120
which before was unheard of it,

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:51.320
because you have one or two tournaments.

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:54.360
If you cannot be called a Nogi fighter,

01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:57.400
fighting once every two years.

01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.280
Twice every two years.

01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.280
Yeah, now there's entire systems

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:03.040
that are optimized for Nogi

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.400
that could be fundamentally different.

02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.840
Like, what do you think about the body lock?

02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:09.160
Like this passing with the body lock,

02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:12.200
I don't know if you get an understanding of it,

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:14.120
I think it's okay.

02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:21.400
It's a popular way to, what is it?

02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:24.720
Maybe to apply.

02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:25.720
To stay tight.

02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:26.560
To stay tight.

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:28.480
Very close to your opponent

02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.120
so he can't push great distance.

02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:31.520
He can push away.

02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:35.920
But somehow it shuts down the hips as well.

02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:36.880
Yeah.

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.240
Makes it more difficult to.

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:40.280
Yeah, kind of trap your legs.

02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:43.800
Your back is stuck on against the floor.

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:47.160
Are you like scientifically curious

02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:48.880
about these new developments?

02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:52.520
Do you think, do you have answers in your head to them?

02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:54.720
Most.

02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.760
So body lock is one interesting one.

02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.320
Obviously foot locks is another.

02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:00.760
And that don't mean just the foot locks,

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:03.960
but the whole like control aspect of foot locks.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.640
That's interesting.

02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:08.080
And there's other interesting stuff.

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:13.080
John is really into the wrestling aspect.

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.880
But not wrestling, wrestling, but wrestling everywhere.

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.000
Jiu-Jitsu at all levels of the plane.

02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:22.440
That's very interesting

02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:26.040
because obviously Jiu-Jitsu has not really been,

02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:29.120
unlike like freestyle wrestling and so on,

02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:32.200
has not been like a systematic scientific

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:34.040
rigorous exploration of wrestling.

02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:36.440
It's like you're on your feet and you're on the ground.

02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.440
Not, not into mix.

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:39.280
There's a lot of interest.

02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.160
John is academic.

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.040
He tried to, you know, numbers, mathematics, everything.

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.280
Well, you kind of are too.

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.680
Yeah.

02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.200
No, I mean, I am.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.000
Because you have to understand what you're doing.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.560
You know, there's a, everything, there's a step by step.

02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:00.960
Like logistic, like details.

02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:03.520
Every single move, there's a reason for it.

02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:05.280
You know, there's things around that happens.

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.760
But it's, the more you know, the better you are, right?

02:02:08.760 --> 02:02:11.720
The more knowledgeable, compare it to whatever.

02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:17.200
So I think with the foot locks, with the nogi,

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.560
like if you look back, you know, if you think of,

02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.400
used to be seen as a really bad thing to attack the foot.

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:29.240
It wasn't seen as a good options of attack.

02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:30.520
Mainly.

02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:31.360
What is that?

02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:33.720
Respectable gentlemen don't attack the leg or what?

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:36.080
No, because if you look back, you know,

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.200
the tournaments, the when they were created,

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:41.400
all the rules and everything else was to simulate

02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:44.640
a real fight with no punches when I was having a gi.

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.320
I mean, if you ask, what is jujitsu?

02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:48.160
Like, what are you trying?

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:50.040
What's the main goal of jujitsu?

02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.240
To dominate your opponent.

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:53.200
What's the main goal of fighting?

02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:54.760
It's we're fighting.

02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:57.400
It's of course, submission is the ultimate goal.

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.600
But the, you know, before that,

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:02.880
the main goal is to dominate you.

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:05.200
Like we're fighting, I have to dominate you.

02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.760
And then the submission comes.

02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:12.400
And foot locks, it's, I don't require any domination on you.

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:16.480
I don't need to be in a dominant position

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:17.800
to attack your foot.

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:21.520
And if I attack your foot, you're still free to knock me out.

02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.080
If your body goes down to my foot,

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.560
I can still come close to you or stand up and I'll punch you.

02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:30.040
So it's not a good position to be in a real fight.

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:32.800
You have to attack in the foot.

02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:36.000
I mean, how many times you've seen that go bad?

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.400
That went bad in MMA fight.

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.520
I mean, of course you had, you know,

02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.920
some sort of success with the huhu ko.

02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:46.000
It's no questions, but how many times went wrong?

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.040
People were knocked out attacking the foot.

02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:50.760
So you can't say it's the best position to be.

02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:55.160
It's okay to go, but it's a very high risky position to go.

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:57.120
So that's why it's not in a real situation.

02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.120
It's not seen as a good thing.

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:00.720
So when you translate that to jujitsu,

02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:03.240
when attacking the foot, it's not seen as a good thing

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:07.040
because when you reflect that to a real situation,

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:08.920
it's not gonna go down well.

02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:13.520
So it was always seen as a easy way out, you know, easy cut.

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.240
You're trying to do the easy path.

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:17.920
You can't pass my guard, you can't dominate me,

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:20.120
and then you're trying to attack my foot.

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:22.680
That's why it was always seen as a, you know,

02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:25.840
it's not as a best, a great submission, a way to win.

02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:27.800
But the sad side effect of that is

02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:30.640
it was completely underdeveloped because of that.

02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:33.320
Exactly, of course.

02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.720
So people never really developed that.

02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:38.680
But now, the tournaments, the fighting,

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:41.480
it got completely, not completely,

02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:45.240
but it got so, it's not longer seen as, you know,

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.160
as a simulation of the real thing.

02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:49.280
Now it's a sport.

02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.960
It's only seen as a sport.

02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:53.280
So now it doesn't matter if you attack my foot,

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:54.720
you cannot punch me.

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:57.760
So why is it bad now to attack the foot?

02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:59.560
So it's not seen as a bad thing anymore.

02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:03.880
And now it got really developed.

02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:07.440
I don't know, that's another bear versus shark question.

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:09.400
But, you know, there is,

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:13.760
in a street self-defense situation,

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:15.760
it's possible to imagine where foot locks

02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:17.560
would be effective for Haile.

02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:20.440
But I guess if you invest 10,000 hours,

02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:24.360
it's better to invest it in chokes.

02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:25.200
Yeah, to dominate.

02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:27.760
If I'm, you know, if we're fighting,

02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:30.080
it's way better for me to be on your side control

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:33.560
on the mount, where I can pin you, be completely safe,

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:36.960
than to stay inside your legs trying to attack your foot.

02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:39.080
But people would argue that there's a lot

02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:41.480
of very dominant controlling positions

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:43.120
in the whole foot lock game, right?

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:45.280
It is, but it can go bad very quickly.

02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:46.120
Yeah.

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:50.160
I mean, there's some great ways to control someone

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:54.280
that he cannot escape, but it can go bad very quickly.

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.120
That's the thing.

02:05:56.120 --> 02:05:58.800
Well, even back control can go bad very quickly

02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.400
on the street.

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:03.680
So mount, I don't know, is mount a really good position?

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:05.440
But then there's no good position, then.

02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:07.280
There's no good position.

02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:08.680
There's no, there's...

02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:11.960
Every position, there's a risk, okay?

02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:13.640
Attacking the foot is a way higher risk

02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:16.600
than side control, mount, back.

02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:19.920
As I'm saying, the back is not the best way

02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:23.240
to pin someone, unless you're underneath me.

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:29.880
Because if you try to rotate, I can sacrifice the back

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:32.800
and just allow you to pin them out.

02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.400
Okay, there you go.

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:37.120
Would you prefer mount or back mount

02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.760
where they're flattened?

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:39.600
Like a...

02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:41.480
Still mount.

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:44.400
That I get you.

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:49.680
So yeah, going back to Gordon,

02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:51.040
what do you think makes that guy so good?

02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:54.000
We were just at ADCC, you get to see him

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:56.560
historically double the performance.

02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:59.640
His dedication, the way he trains,

02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.440
and how much he trains.

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:04.240
And of course you have to add his mind,

02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:08.880
his belief to really try to be good, the best.

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:11.360
So, you know, I don't know what his goals are,

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:13.880
but I know he's tried to be better than his opponents.

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:15.880
So his belief are very strong.

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:20.960
His dedication, he probably trains more than everybody else.

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.720
I mean, I haven't seen firsthand it,

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:26.920
but from what I hear interviews with him

02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:28.520
and everybody else training, you know,

02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:30.880
the way everybody trains, you know,

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:35.880
trying to, for my little knowledge I have,

02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:38.160
I'll bet he trains more than everybody else.

02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:41.280
And most important, how he trains.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:44.320
And when I, I kind of already knew,

02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:48.400
but when I heard John podcast with you the other day,

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:50.920
John was explaining the preparation,

02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:52.280
the training for the ADCC,

02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:56.360
and that kind of gave me a very strong idea

02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:58.840
how they've been training all these years.

02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:01.320
So, you know, when we said it's,

02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:02.560
you have to work on your weakness,

02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:05.040
so you have no weakness.

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:07.520
He trains a lot on his weakness,

02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:10.400
which not everyone does that.

02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:12.240
You know, if you look at the,

02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:13.920
I'm not gonna name, but you know,

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:17.840
all the main schools went like very strong competitors,

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:21.080
great competitors, super tough people,

02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:24.280
but super tough, not great,

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:27.240
because they train, they spar very hard,

02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:29.120
that makes them tough.

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:32.200
If you wanna be good, you have to work on your weakness,

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.400
because when you spar, like we're saying,

02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:38.200
how many times you're gonna practice

02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:40.600
scaping a bad position,

02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:43.200
like a submission hold or a pinning position,

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:45.200
side control, mount, or,

02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:48.680
it's very little the amount of time you get to spend

02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:50.960
on those positions if you don't start there.

02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:55.600
So that, he's very smart the way he trains.

02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:57.320
And part of that is also cerebral.

02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:59.280
It's not just putting yourself in those positions,

02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:02.400
but talking through different ideas.

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.320
Like they talk, they like experiment.

02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:10.280
It's very like, at first glance,

02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:12.440
it's like philosophical almost,

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:14.560
because you're trying to create systems constantly,

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.000
you're trying to understand how this fits

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.520
into this big picture.

02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:21.600
And then he goes back to what is jiu-jitsu,

02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.080
what he's fighting.

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:25.000
He's fighting for dominance.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.840
He's fighting for the ultimate dominance positions,

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.400
which is back and mount.

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:31.840
There's no others, and from that you finish.

02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:34.000
So if you look back at his,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.200
over the years of his past fights,

02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:40.280
before he used to mainly focus in legs,

02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:42.880
and over the past few years,

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:45.560
now he's mainly focusing in finishing

02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:47.440
from the mountain back.

02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:49.280
But that's when he became really good.

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:54.120
So part of that is Mr. John Donaher.

02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:57.560
What do you think, you've known John for a long time.

02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.560
What makes that guy interesting, special, and good?

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:04.280
What have you learned about jiu-jitsu

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:06.160
and life from John Donaher?

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:09.840
He's super smart, I mean, eccentric,

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:12.520
and he lives through jiu-jitsu.

02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:16.920
He's 24-7, thinking better ways to teach,

02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:19.880
how to make his competitors better.

02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.640
And that as a coach, when you have that dedication

02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:25.200
as a coach, that it makes the most difference

02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.040
of your athletes.

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:28.400
Like, which other big team you have

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:30.880
that coach with that motivation?

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:34.720
All the other schools is either someone that competes,

02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:36.960
that push the training, like Andrea Galvão.

02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:39.200
He's one of the competitors.

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:41.560
So he brings the hype in everyone else,

02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:44.080
but he doesn't have the time.

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.400
He doesn't spend the time working individually.

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:47.280
I mean, I'm sure he does,

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:49.680
but it's limited because he's also a competitor.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:54.400
And, you know, looking most of the other big schools,

02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:57.360
like, you don't have that.

02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:00.280
Now, all the leaders, the main coaches

02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.520
for the other big schools, they have other things,

02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:04.320
other things in their lives.

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:08.280
They don't fully dedicate it to the athletes, John does.

02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:11.240
You know, look at the interview he spends.

02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:15.640
Hours and hours a day studying how can a way,

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:18.760
the system, you know, to make his athletes better.

02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:21.400
Look at the results.

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.840
I enjoy, I was just sending back and forth.

02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:25.840
You can actually just get him,

02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:28.480
you control him essentially by sending interesting videos

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.080
and you could just see his mind.

02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:33.080
He's gonna do research on that.

02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:34.920
Cause I kept sending him videos of bears

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:39.920
cause he claimed that a lion would beat a bear

02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.440
because I'd love to get your take on this.

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.440
Okay, so the bear is much bigger, much stronger.

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.560
But his take is that the bears don't have experience

02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:53.520
of fighting to the death.

02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:54.640
That's not part of the culture.

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.960
They're more scared.

02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:58.920
In fact, he keeps sending me footage of like,

02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:02.080
even like a small mountain lion scaring a bear away

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:04.080
because they don't want to fight.

02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:09.760
So his idea is that it really matters your life experience,

02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:11.120
how much you fight.

02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:13.680
It's not necessarily the skill,

02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:16.400
like the dimensions, the characteristics you have.

02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:19.440
But then I sent him, I'll show you.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:26.080
People should Google this.

02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:29.240
It's bears fighting of any kind.

02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:31.720
It's pretty much the most epic thing ever.

02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:33.800
Here, I'll show you.

02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:35.400
Like, look at these guys.

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:37.120
The cardio though is interesting.

02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.080
You know, it's funny, I was gonna mention that

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:41.600
cause I was, you know, flipping to internet.

02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:45.920
I came, I came around that video.

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.440
Look how big these guys are.

02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:50.560
No, they're huge, but you see they don't bite each other.

02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:51.400
You think it's just play?

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.920
They're trying to, no, intimidating

02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:54.640
cause they don't want to get hurt.

02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.640
So they try to size each other up.

02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:59.800
You know, they've, you see the whole fighting

02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:01.560
is sizing each other up.

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.200
There's a lot of pushing

02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:05.160
and the fur is so thick,

02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:07.480
so the claws doesn't really damage much.

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:11.640
They're using the tree, so maybe they, yeah.

02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:15.200
I mean, there is bites, but see, there's very little.

02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.360
So the whole time they're trying to

02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:21.040
intimidate the other one,

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.600
like winning the fight by their size.

02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:31.800
And mostly about like the way drunk college kids fight,

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:33.600
which is like some kind of display

02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:35.280
of dominance versus actual.

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:37.600
Yeah, they're not fighting to kill.

02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:42.920
And bear or tiger, you know, they fight to finish.

02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:46.440
Unless the other one runs away, like one will die.

02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.000
Yeah, the lions and tigers.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.600
Yeah, I, but look at the cardio.

02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:52.320
Look how bad their cardio is.

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:55.600
I wonder how, my favorite part

02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:58.880
is where one of them just like stands behind a tree

02:13:58.880 --> 02:13:59.880
and says, all right.

02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:00.720
He's holding.

02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:06.880
Let me catch my breath here.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:08.400
He sits down.

02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:11.440
He's like, all right, you can't, it's over.

02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:15.600
It's like, it's the equivalent in the forest,

02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:17.720
tapping out, all right, all right, you got me.

02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:19.920
Let me just, just catch your breath.

02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:23.680
Look, they're both like just shot.

02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:28.560
But see, the thing is that I was trying

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:32.080
to make an argument for is that we get this rare footage.

02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:32.920
It's not rare.

02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:34.000
I mean, there's like hundreds of videos,

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.440
but it's not millions of videos

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:37.360
because there's a huge number of bears.

02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:39.320
And I was trying to say that there's some badass bear

02:14:39.320 --> 02:14:43.480
we don't know about because he just goes in there

02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:44.960
and just does work.

02:14:46.080 --> 02:14:49.760
And we just don't know about it because he's like everyone.

02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:52.400
See, the thing is, if you kill a lot of other animals,

02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:54.000
you probably have a territory

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.120
that nobody's going to mess with you.

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:56.760
So it's very hard to catch the,

02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:02.440
like the Hydra Gracie of bears, you know?

02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:06.040
He's just going to be sitting there doing nothing.

02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:07.680
So I don't know.

02:15:07.680 --> 02:15:08.520
I don't know.

02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:11.120
I feel like, of course, when you corner him,

02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:14.800
John will say that if you put a bear and a lion in a cage,

02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:16.240
the bear will win if it's like,

02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:20.720
if they're forced to be to the death, but I don't know.

02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:22.240
Oh, let me ask you another ridiculous thing

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:24.840
before I ask you serious questions.

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:28.320
So Joe Rogan thinks that a tie

02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:33.080
is an effective way to attack somebody.

02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:35.720
I don't know if, I can't believe I haven't,

02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:38.200
in the time in Vegas, I didn't talk to you about this.

02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:39.280
I think it's not.

02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:43.440
Have you ever explored this as the best choker in the world?

02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:45.360
Have you ever explored the use?

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:48.400
Because like, Jujitsu has the jacket,

02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:53.400
but the tie to me is a pretty shitty way to choke somebody.

02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:56.480
Like intuitively, he thinks like it's a good way,

02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:58.160
but it can slide around.

02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:03.160
It feels like there's no way to really pin.

02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:05.120
You would need to.

02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:08.600
Right, so you use it the way you use a belt, essentially.

02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:09.920
Yeah, but then.

02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:10.760
I would guess so.

02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:11.600
Yeah.

02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:16.160
I don't think it's, and I think if it gives you,

02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:17.560
it actually has the reverse effect,

02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:20.800
which it gives you the false sense of confidence

02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:22.480
that you can use it.

02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:24.480
And instead, it will just distract you.

02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:27.560
So he think it's a stronger way than the collar?

02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:28.400
Or just a stronger way?

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:29.240
Yeah.

02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.080
Stronger than the collar?

02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:30.920
Stronger than the collar, yeah, yeah.

02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:32.320
I don't see how.

02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:33.720
Maybe I just, I can't say.

02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:35.200
In a street fight scenario, right?

02:16:35.200 --> 02:16:36.320
Like.

02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:37.640
But by the time you grab the tie,

02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:39.040
the guy goes punch your nose.

02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:39.880
Yeah.

02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:44.400
What George St. Pierre thinks is the best use of the tie

02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:48.240
is to actually like a, what do you call that?

02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:50.200
So basically to off balance them.

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:52.480
Which is an interesting point, to like.

02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:54.400
I mean, that can be used too.

02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:55.240
Yeah.

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:57.640
But you could use the jacket for the same kind of thing.

02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:58.480
Yeah, I don't know.

02:16:58.480 --> 02:16:59.600
I haven't really fully tested it.

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:00.440
It's a.

02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:02.800
I'll say jacket or tie for that perspective

02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:05.560
of off balancing the person.

02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:06.880
It can be, yeah.

02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:09.320
Because you have control of the person's neck.

02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:11.920
The collar, the jacket moves.

02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:14.840
So for the purpose of off balancing the person,

02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:16.800
I would agree with George.

02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:19.560
See, the thing is, that's the thing about martial arts,

02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:21.400
is you can say all kinds of bullshit.

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:27.160
But until you really test it in over a period of years,

02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:29.000
the competition, you won't really know.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.760
I think like that's where my gut says,

02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:35.000
just how easily the tie moves.

02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:37.280
My gut says the collar,

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:40.120
there is something really powerful about the jacket.

02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:42.880
There's like the way it sits.

02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:46.200
I mean, the fact that the arms trap it from rotating.

02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:47.040
Yeah.

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:48.480
Like it's a weird piece of clothing.

02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:50.240
It's a really dangerous piece of clothing

02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:51.360
that we put on ourselves.

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:52.200
Yeah.

02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:54.840
And it's kind of cool that we've developed

02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.040
this whole martial arts system

02:17:56.040 --> 02:17:59.320
that allows you to use that to do a lot of damage.

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:00.600
It's very interesting.

02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:02.840
So when we're saying something that you develop

02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:05.480
over the years of practice over and over again,

02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:09.120
going back to the fissures of the mantle back,

02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:12.080
by experience of attacking people,

02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:17.920
people always had a much higher chance of escaping

02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:19.760
from the back than from my mount.

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.720
So it's, I feel if I mount

02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:25.880
and you get both my hands on your neck,

02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:26.840
you cannot escape.

02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:29.600
If my hands are deep, it's over.

02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:33.040
Like that, I don't remember anyone escaping,

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:36.520
but I do remember if my hands are deep on your collar

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:39.320
or even your naked choke, it's still a hassle.

02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:40.600
Like it's not clean.

02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:42.520
You have some data on this.

02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:46.280
Is there some aspect to how your body is,

02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:47.840
the characteristics of your body

02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:50.840
that fits a particular set of techniques?

02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:53.840
So if we just look at you just too broadly,

02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:56.960
do you see most techniques being able to work

02:18:56.960 --> 02:18:58.360
for most people?

02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:01.240
Like what you're saying about mount versus back control,

02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:03.320
is this, is it possible for a different body type

02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:04.720
to mount is not as effective?

02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:06.800
Yeah, of course.

02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:09.760
I'll say very big people.

02:19:09.760 --> 02:19:11.360
They should have mount.

02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:13.440
You don't think of yourself as big?

02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:15.120
Not big, I mean fat.

02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:15.960
Oh.

02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:18.520
They should stay off the mount.

02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:19.360
Why is that?

02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:20.200
That's a connotative.

02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:21.040
It's mobility.

02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:22.600
It's like, it's a thing that, you know,

02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:25.840
you don't see any, you know, like there was a few ways,

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:29.320
like 160 kilos, like, you know, two pounds.

02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:33.640
I don't know, 270 pounds of a lot of fat.

02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:36.840
It's, you need a bit of mobility

02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:40.000
and that wouldn't, it would play against you.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.520
So even back.

02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:44.000
A great mount requires mobility.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:44.920
Yeah.

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:45.760
Okay.

02:19:45.760 --> 02:19:47.640
Even though it doesn't look like you're moving very much

02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:49.840
when you're doing mount, that requires mobility.

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.680
Yeah.

02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:52.920
Cause you have to reposition and weight redistribution.

02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:54.880
Constantly adjusting your body.

02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:55.720
All right.

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.400
The legend goes, you got very good

02:19:57.400 --> 02:19:59.880
by training mostly with lower ranks.

02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:02.280
What was your training like in that environment?

02:20:03.600 --> 02:20:07.240
So when I first moved to London, I was 20 years old.

02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:13.680
I opened my school there and I had nobody to train with.

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:18.160
I had one guy that was teaching with me a black belt,

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:19.000
middleweight.

02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:21.240
He was good.

02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:24.440
And that's it.

02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:29.440
Braulio was, he moved to England the same time as I did,

02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:31.200
but he was in Birmingham.

02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:34.640
So we did got together, you know, maybe twice a week,

02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:37.560
closer, you know, when we were preparing for something.

02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:40.320
If not, then not very often.

02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:44.400
As often as we could, but let's say not that often.

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:47.200
And I had just color belt students.

02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:48.600
There was no one high level.

02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:51.240
There was no one world champion in any belt to train.

02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:57.080
Then you need to create a scenario that simulates,

02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:02.080
that can simulate, you know, like a realistic fighting.

02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:07.200
So I think on that aspect, you know, when people said,

02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:10.400
you know, people ask, why do I have such a basic game?

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:14.200
I think that also influenced me sharpen up all my skills

02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:17.360
when I moved there, because, you know,

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:21.320
if you practice with people, you know, lower level than you,

02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:26.320
you cannot, there's nothing to learn from them.

02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:28.880
Or, you know, you can learn things and practice with them,

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:31.840
but I would say very complex things on them.

02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:33.040
It is not the best.

02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:36.160
So I sharpen up all my skills.

02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:39.280
So, you know, that when I really improved everything

02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:42.080
that I already knew to a higher level.

02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:43.720
But how can you sharpen something

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:46.680
if the resistance is much lower level than?

02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:48.560
A purple belt can make it very hard

02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:49.880
for you to skip side control.

02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:52.600
Doesn't have to be a world champion black belt.

02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:55.520
It's, you know, if it's, when it's holding you,

02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:56.600
it can be very hard.

02:21:56.600 --> 02:21:57.920
What about on the attack?

02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:02.240
How do you become literally by far the best person

02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:05.400
at the cross choke from mount by training with purple belts?

02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:08.840
It's sometimes purple belts defends way better

02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:10.240
than black belts.

02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:11.080
Okay.

02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:12.960
See, a lot of people listening to that would be like,

02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:15.200
that makes no sense, Roger Gracie.

02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:16.800
How does that make any sense?

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:19.000
Because like a lot of the black belts,

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
even world champion, they get to the black belt,

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.960
they're really good in what they do.

02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:25.920
Let's say in the guard, you know,

02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:27.600
on top or in the bottom position,

02:22:27.600 --> 02:22:29.440
but their defense are not.

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:32.560
Like very, very few people high level

02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:35.880
have a very good defense because they don't practice.

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:38.440
Then that goes back to how you train.

02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:40.120
You know, you can be very tough,

02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:42.800
very tough will make you terrible defense

02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:45.360
because you're not gonna practice your weakness.

02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:47.720
So your weakness is still gonna be terrible.

02:22:47.720 --> 02:22:49.560
You can have the best guard in the world,

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.240
impossible to pass.

02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:54.040
The day people pass your guard, you're nothing.

02:22:54.040 --> 02:22:58.680
Like it's, your guard is high, the highest level,

02:22:58.680 --> 02:23:01.000
but your side control defense are not.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.400
Your mount defense are not.

02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:07.400
So some purple belts, they practice the mount

02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:09.520
way more than the black belt did.

02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:11.680
So naturally the difference is better.

02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:14.280
So they get to experience the defensive position

02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:15.280
much, much, much more.

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:16.720
And especially training with you,

02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:19.240
they get really good at defending.

02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:20.400
And then over and over again,

02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:22.440
you attack them with the same thing over and over again.

02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.400
They know what's coming, they will block.

02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:26.520
They will develop a defense over that.

02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:31.000
Way better than most other high level black belts.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.600
So both put yourself into really bad positions

02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:36.120
with lower ranks and just keep attacking them

02:23:36.120 --> 02:23:37.920
the same way over and over and over.

02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:40.320
Yeah.

02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:44.400
And with that, you're able to be at the top of the world,

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:45.800
at the world championships.

02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:47.240
Yeah.

02:23:47.240 --> 02:23:48.840
I mean, can you give some,

02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:51.600
what was the preparation like to a world championship

02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:52.520
with lower ranks?

02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:54.000
I mean.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:57.640
I did a lot of boxing, a lot of conditioning.

02:23:57.640 --> 02:23:58.480
No, but the-

02:23:58.480 --> 02:23:59.320
Conditioning is a big part of it.

02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:02.880
But the one thing that helped me extremely

02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:05.240
living in England, in London,

02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:08.720
was training judo at the Budokwai in London.

02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:11.000
That helped me massively because

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.640
it gave me the motivation to learn something new

02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:18.400
because by then at the Budokwai,

02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:22.040
the standup was, I'm sure today it is too,

02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:24.640
but by then was even higher than it is today.

02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:28.520
Like there was some very high level judo guys training there

02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:31.320
and the first time I went there,

02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:35.000
my standup was terrible compared to theirs.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:38.160
I mean, it was bad, but compared to them was terrible.

02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:39.960
So I was getting thrown like a child.

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:46.240
And that motivated me to keep coming back and get better.

02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:49.800
So that made my jiu-jitsu much stronger.

02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:54.080
I became, my base got better, my top game improved,

02:24:54.080 --> 02:24:55.760
my pressure game improved.

02:24:56.600 --> 02:24:58.680
Did, does Neil Adams train?

02:24:58.680 --> 02:24:59.520
Ray Stevens.

02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:00.360
Ray Stevens.

02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:01.960
No, when he, I've never met Neil Adams.

02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:02.800
Ray Stevens.

02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:03.640
Have you met Neil Adams?

02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:04.480
No.

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:05.320
He's the voice of judo.

02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:06.680
I don't know if you watched the tournaments,

02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.000
he's incredible.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.040
Yeah, Ray Stevens is a,

02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:12.680
he was a silver medalist in the Olympics.

02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:14.760
He won European, he won a lot.

02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:15.840
So you did some judo training.

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.800
What's your favorite throw, like a Soto?

02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:18.640
Like you don't-

02:25:18.640 --> 02:25:19.480
Uchi Mata, I'll say. Uchi Mata.

02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:20.600
Your favorite pick one.

02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:22.400
So that made you better at jiu-jitsu as well.

02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:23.960
Yeah, yeah.

02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:24.800
Okay.

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:27.800
And back then, like for the first,

02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.080
I'll say maybe three years, maybe four,

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:33.880
I went to Brazil for like two months before

02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:35.200
every major tournament.

02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:36.040
Got it.

02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:37.520
So I say, you know, I moved away from the school

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:38.800
and I really focused.

02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:41.480
I was really well prepared with my judo

02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:43.280
and everything else, sharpening up my skills.

02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:46.240
And then went, going to Brazil to train

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:48.600
with like really high level people.

02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:53.080
So that way I would manage to compete in the highest level.

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:55.400
What advice would you give to,

02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:58.080
let's start with a complete beginner.

02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:01.600
So, you know, a bunch of people come up to me

02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:03.120
and they still want to start doing jiu-jitsu.

02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:05.640
What advice would you give them?

02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:09.640
Try to absorb as much technique as you can

02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:13.120
and try to be as relaxed as you can.

02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:18.120
Don't, you know, don't desperately try to fight so hard.

02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:20.720
Like learn and move slow.

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:23.720
Move slow and relax.

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:25.520
That's the hardest thing to do.

02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:27.360
The hardest.

02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:29.840
You know, you know what I find with people,

02:26:29.840 --> 02:26:33.760
it seems like it's hard to even know that you're not relaxed.

02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:36.320
It's like the introspection.

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:39.560
They don't even know what it feels like to relax.

02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.160
Not even know they tense.

02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:42.000
Yeah, right.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.520
They try to relax you, look how you see.

02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:44.360
What?

02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:45.200
What do you mean, relax?

02:26:45.200 --> 02:26:46.040
I'm relaxed.

02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:46.880
The eyes are shaking.

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:47.720
You feel it.

02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:49.680
And in terms of going slow, they're like,

02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:50.760
yeah, I'm going slow.

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:52.600
No, you're not.

02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:56.600
Yeah, there's a grace and elegance of movement

02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:00.560
that you can probably pick up from a lot of other disciplines.

02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:03.000
Like for me, I think that came from just learning piano

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:03.840
at a young age.

02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:07.840
That's for, I think any mobility thing

02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.920
to learn how to move efficiently,

02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:12.000
you have to know how to move efficiently.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
You have to know how to move efficiently.

02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:15.520
You have to know how to move efficiently.

02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:17.080
You have to know how to relax.

02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:18.600
So it's just the fact that you can,

02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:22.160
like, the body can be tense or it can be relaxed.

02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:24.040
Just knowing that fact.

02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:25.800
Now imagine you show the stance.

02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:26.640
Yeah.

02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:27.640
To say you play piano well.

02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:29.640
No, everything has to be relaxed.

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.600
I guess some of that is mind too,

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:34.440
but just knowing that and being self-aware.

02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:36.680
But see, like, even me,

02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:40.960
approaching a thing I'm not,

02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:43.600
I don't know anything about being a beginner.

02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:44.960
You're going to tense up.

02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:47.400
And like, it actually takes a conscious effort

02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:48.800
to think to relax.

02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:49.640
I mean, that's-

02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:50.480
Massively.

02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:52.600
That's why learning things as an adult

02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:53.960
is much harder than as a child.

02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:55.720
Like, it's very hard.

02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:59.600
And as an adult, it's like to get to the highest level,

02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:01.320
it's not possible.

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:04.800
Because you will never relax the way you should.

02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:05.640
Yeah.

02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:08.520
Relax in the way that you become like water,

02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:11.080
but then you solidify in the right places.

02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:12.960
Yeah.

02:28:14.040 --> 02:28:15.320
Yeah.

02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:17.480
Is there advice you can give to an adult?

02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:20.560
So like somebody that has a job, like a hobbyist,

02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:21.760
like how to progress, how to get better?

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:24.120
I mean, train.

02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:26.560
Just need to train as much as you can.

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:29.120
Not, you know, five, seven days a week

02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:31.120
because you're going to get injured.

02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:34.200
I mean, two or three times a week to start

02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:39.200
is the best way to initiate your Jiu-Jitsu journey

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:42.520
and practice the same thing over and over again.

02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:43.600
When they don't work,

02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:45.400
it's just because you're not doing well,

02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:48.800
not because, you know, you have to learn something else.

02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:51.160
Do you see some value in just picking a set of techniques

02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:54.160
that seem to draw your heart in?

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:55.840
Like for example, I'll give you an example,

02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:57.560
you're gonna yell at me.

02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:02.560
But I never learned the close guard well.

02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:07.480
It just never connected with me.

02:29:07.480 --> 02:29:08.720
You could say it's body mechanics,

02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:09.880
whatever, it doesn't matter.

02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:12.400
The point is, it's just like my heart

02:29:13.280 --> 02:29:14.360
never connected with it.

02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:16.480
You know, the way I justified it to myself

02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:18.040
is I felt like when you're bad,

02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:19.280
you're using the close guard

02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:21.880
just like you could use the half guard to stall.

02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:25.080
So I was really drawn to the butterfly guard as a beginner

02:29:25.080 --> 02:29:28.720
because I thought that I have, or open guard in general,

02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:31.480
I have no options to stall.

02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:32.440
So I'm going to learn.

02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:35.120
My thinking was, let me do the guard

02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:37.280
that enforces me to learn.

02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:38.880
And then I fell in love with the butterfly guard

02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:40.280
and the open guard and so on.

02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:44.240
And I never, I never really understood the close guard.

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:45.680
And the other thinking was,

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.880
do I really need to understand the close guard?

02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:51.680
Because it's always by choice that I go there.

02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:53.000
So I can avoid not really learning.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.280
I mean, you can avoid anything you want.

02:29:56.480 --> 02:29:58.880
I mean, you don't have to do anything.

02:29:58.880 --> 02:29:59.720
In this life, yes.

02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:01.560
It doesn't make you complete.

02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:02.400
That means you have a weakness.

02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:04.240
But do you want to be complete as a,

02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:05.200
this is the question,

02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:08.880
how valuable is it to be complete to get good?

02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:12.680
Depends how good you want to be.

02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:15.200
Okay, let's go.

02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.080
Well, there's several questions there.

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:17.920
Yeah, okay.

02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:19.200
Like to be the best in the world,

02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.840
do you need to be complete?

02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:22.320
Of course.

02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:23.240
The best in the world?

02:30:23.240 --> 02:30:24.800
Of course you have to be complete.

02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:28.560
Otherwise you, somebody's going to be better than you.

02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:31.480
But what about like, so to understand to defend,

02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.560
you have to be also good at the offense

02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:35.320
in every single position?

02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:37.360
Otherwise you have a weakness

02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:41.080
and someone can capitalize on that weakness.

02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:43.400
Okay, what about to be like a hobbyist?

02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:44.560
Then you don't have to.

02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:47.560
But can you, or is it still bad?

02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:48.400
I mean, it's not bad.

02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:49.520
I mean, nothing is bad.

02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:52.360
I mean, as a hobbyist, you start late.

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:55.320
I mean, it doesn't matter how far you're going to get.

02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:56.280
As long as you enjoy it,

02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:58.960
just train as much as you can.

02:30:58.960 --> 02:31:01.440
If it's twice a week, twice a week it is.

02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:04.400
You'll be limited how good you will be training

02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:06.280
twice a week, of course.

02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.720
Then the guy that trains twice a day.

02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:11.920
You know, the more you train, the better you get.

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:13.360
But you have to select what you train.

02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:14.200
That's what I'm asking.

02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:15.040
I don't know, yes.

02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:16.800
But like for how long?

02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:18.720
Like at some point in your life

02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:21.280
that you might try something.

02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:22.120
See if you like it.

02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:23.640
You know, there's some point in your life

02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:25.680
that you might, okay, let me try close guard.

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.600
You might not like it now.

02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:29.960
Maybe in two, three years from now.

02:31:29.960 --> 02:31:30.800
Still don't like it.

02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:32.200
I kept trying it.

02:31:32.200 --> 02:31:35.040
Listen, because listen, it's very difficult

02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:37.160
to get any respect in jiu-jitsu.

02:31:37.160 --> 02:31:41.320
It's hard to get to black belt and beyond in jiu-jitsu

02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:46.160
at a respectable place and not have a good close guard.

02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:47.000
Close guard is-

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.840
Yeah, I mean, then don't do it.

02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:50.640
It's not necessary.

02:31:50.640 --> 02:31:51.800
I'm being a rebel.

02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:53.080
No, it's not.

02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:55.800
I'll say, because it's not a position

02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:58.080
that you want the pressure,

02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:00.640
that if you don't know you'll be in trouble.

02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:01.480
You're not going to be in trouble

02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:02.800
not to know the close guard.

02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:04.520
You're just going to go straight for open guard.

02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:06.040
It's not a problem.

02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:09.080
The main limitation is if you don't do a close guard a lot,

02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:10.840
that you don't quite,

02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:14.680
you don't get a full complete picture

02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:16.560
of understanding how to attack close guard

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:18.280
when somebody puts you into a close guard,

02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:19.480
when you're on top.

02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:21.760
So it's nice to know both sides if it's just to understand.

02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:25.440
Yeah, but you can have a pretty good understanding

02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:28.880
of how to defend from the top and not having any bottom.

02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:31.240
I mean, some of it is also just like the length of legs

02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:33.320
and just the geometry of your body.

02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:37.760
Nick, I'm sure Marcel Garcia has a good close guard.

02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:39.200
I've never seen it.

02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:41.400
That's the point I'm trying to make.

02:32:43.400 --> 02:32:47.120
In theory, you can imagine it.

02:32:47.120 --> 02:32:49.960
For a hobbyist, I think it's interesting to think of that.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.800
Is it possible to,

02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:59.680
is it possible to focus on a small set of techniques

02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:01.360
that help you to develop

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:02.200
Yeah, of course.

02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:03.040
still into a good jiu-jitsu player.

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:03.880
Yeah, of course.

02:33:04.040 --> 02:33:08.840
I mean, most people hobbies in the jiu-jitsu world,

02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:10.400
99%.

02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:11.800
I mean, people there compete.

02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:13.200
Yeah, even the people that compete.

02:33:13.200 --> 02:33:14.320
1% max.

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:18.520
And you have high level competitors

02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:20.360
have no clue what close guard is.

02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:22.080
Okay, thank you for me.

02:33:22.080 --> 02:33:25.040
No, I think you would say that most people don't.

02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:29.560
Close guard is such a difficult position to understand.

02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:30.640
For me.

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.240
Maybe one day we'll brainwash.

02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:33.320
Yeah, good.

02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:36.200
I felt it's too easy to stall

02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:39.800
versus attack.

02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:42.000
That was my main concern is like,

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.120
I wanna be forced in every way to

02:33:45.960 --> 02:33:48.880
to always be attacking, to always be moving, to always be.

02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:52.040
And it felt like if I got really good,

02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:54.800
I've seen it happen with half guard too.

02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:56.840
It's like when people get really good at half guard,

02:33:56.840 --> 02:33:58.240
it just feels stally.

02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:01.720
If you just look at the matches and so on,

02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:04.920
you just slow things down to a thing that's not,

02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:06.920
you don't get reps on learning.

02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:10.040
You don't get action in interesting ways.

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:13.400
So that was my worry that I'll get old and fat

02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:15.960
and just sitting in close guard all day,

02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:19.880
holding on to the white belts trying to kill me.

02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:21.520
Cause it's also, I mean, that's the other thing

02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:25.280
for hobbyists and for everyone is to,

02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:29.840
when you first start, I think you have to relax

02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:31.800
in the face of the fact that you're just getting

02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:33.840
your ass kicked nonstop.

02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:35.800
That can also be really tough on the ego.

02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:37.640
I think probably the right way to see that

02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:39.880
is you're growing as a person.

02:34:39.880 --> 02:34:42.760
You'll see that clearly when they are like

02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:46.040
in a bad position, let's say side mount or mount.

02:34:46.040 --> 02:34:50.240
Like a beginner, he will never relax on those positions.

02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:52.280
The moment that you say go,

02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:57.200
they like trying to push you out and explode.

02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:00.160
There's no relaxation and work on the defense.

02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:04.920
It's like, no, it's out and go until I have zero to give

02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:07.120
until I'm exhausted.

02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:08.600
My arms cannot move.

02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:12.120
It's kind of fun to watch actually.

02:35:12.120 --> 02:35:13.520
What's the role of drilling?

02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:16.400
Do you like drilling?

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:18.720
I do not like drilling, but I'll tell you why.

02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:25.120
I think fighting is mechanic, right?

02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:29.520
So it's very important to drill a move

02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:31.120
until you learn the mechanic.

02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:32.440
Of course it's important.

02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:35.600
If someone want to teach you an armlock,

02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:37.520
you want to practice that movement

02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:39.120
until you learn the mechanic of it,

02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.440
but the guy's not resisting, so it's easy to apply, right?

02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:47.200
So you apply as many times as you have to

02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:49.080
until you know the mechanic of the moves,

02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:51.160
until you can apply the mechanics.

02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:53.320
The moment that you know how to apply,

02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:55.040
there's no more point in drilling

02:35:55.960 --> 02:35:57.760
because now you have to practice.

02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:00.480
Now you have to practice with resistance.

02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:01.920
Of course you're not going to practice

02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:03.800
with the guy fully resisting.

02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:04.640
The guy's better than you

02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:06.000
because he's not going to give you a chance

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:06.840
to practice that move,

02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:09.360
but you have to practice with resistance.

02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:12.840
So where does drilling comes on that?

02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:17.840
It's most of people, they flow, drill and everything.

02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.360
Whatever you do, you condition in your body to do something.

02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:24.920
You repeat the same move over and over again.

02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:27.080
So your body's conditioning to apply that movement

02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:28.800
or the technique.

02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:30.600
Drilling is not realistic

02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:33.240
because the other person is not resisting.

02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:34.600
The flow movement or whatever.

02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:39.600
After you go beyond, when you already know the mechanics,

02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:41.680
the drilling with no resistance

02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:43.160
is not going to teach you anything

02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:45.080
because you will never know

02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:47.560
how to apply the movement with resistance.

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:50.120
So it's pointless to carry on drilling

02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:51.960
after you learn the mechanics.

02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:56.520
You're making it sound easy to learn the mechanics,

02:36:56.520 --> 02:36:57.480
I would argue.

02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:00.080
You can drill as many times.

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:03.840
I'm not limiting how much you drill.

02:37:03.840 --> 02:37:06.080
You drill as long as you had to.

02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:08.440
I mean, it doesn't matter how long.

02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:09.800
The benefit of drilling,

02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:12.160
I'm just playing devil's advocate with you.

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:14.120
The benefit of drilling is that

02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:16.880
you can more efficiently get a higher number of reps in.

02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:21.880
What are you going to gain with those reps?

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:24.040
Understanding the mechanics of the movement.

02:37:24.040 --> 02:37:26.040
And what I would like to argue

02:37:26.040 --> 02:37:27.800
is you don't necessarily need a resistance

02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:30.000
to deeply understand the mechanics of something.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Now, I don't need, there's some moves.

02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:37.000
Like, I bet you,

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:41.280
you could drill your way to an incredible mount.

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:44.720
Mount is a good example of that.

02:37:44.720 --> 02:37:47.240
You don't really need a resist mount.

02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:50.240
I can imagine a world in which the resisting opponent

02:37:50.240 --> 02:37:52.360
is not essential for developing

02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:55.800
some of the very fine details of the mechanics.

02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:56.640
Which one?

02:37:56.640 --> 02:37:57.960
Because I don't know any.

02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:58.800
What?

02:37:58.800 --> 02:37:59.640
You say mount.

02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:00.480
Yes.

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:04.760
What are you going to achieve by drilling

02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:07.160
with no resistance after you learn the mechanics?

02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:08.000
In mount.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:08.920
But see, what I'm trying to tell you,

02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:11.040
the learning of the mechanics isn't a thing

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:12.960
where you get a certificate and you're done.

02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:15.040
You're going to learn the fine details

02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:17.120
of the way you redistribute your weight.

02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:19.000
You're going to learn how to move your,

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:19.840
I don't understand mount.

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:21.560
At that body.

02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:22.400
What?

02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:23.240
Yeah.

02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:25.840
Like everything you do is a slow process and timing.

02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:28.640
You have to understand moving.

02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:29.480
Okay.

02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:31.720
If the guy's resisting, like he's not,

02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:34.160
I'm not going to grab you and apply the movement.

02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:38.360
I need to grab you and feel when is the right time to do.

02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:41.800
Like that only comes when you're with movement.

02:38:41.800 --> 02:38:45.160
If you're not fully resistant, how would I know?

02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:48.040
You couldn't infer through it.

02:38:48.040 --> 02:38:49.560
It's like a.

02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:51.480
With no movement, with no resistance.

02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:52.320
Like armlock.

02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:53.160
There's some resistance.

02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:55.200
Okay, armlock, let's see armlock.

02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:56.040
Okay.

02:38:56.040 --> 02:38:57.800
Okay, let's say you've been drilling for a week.

02:38:57.800 --> 02:38:58.640
Yeah.

02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.840
Five hours a day.

02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:03.120
You should be an expert with the mechanics.

02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:06.720
But now, how are you going to carry on drilling

02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:08.520
with no resistance?

02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:09.360
No.

02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:10.200
Exactly.

02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:13.520
After that week, drilling five times, five hours a day,

02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:16.240
the armlock, you still have no clue

02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:19.360
how to apply the armlock against a resisting opponent.

02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:20.840
No clue, zero.

02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:23.200
So you don't know the movement, you know the mechanic,

02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:26.960
which is like how long you have to drill

02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:30.560
and how that doesn't matter, it varies of the person.

02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.040
You can do for a month.

02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:33.760
After that month is over,

02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:36.400
you should understand how the mechanic works.

02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:38.440
You still have no clue how to apply the movement

02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:40.040
against a resisting opponent.

02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:42.160
You will never ever know how

02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:45.120
until you apply with a fully resisting opponent.

02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:47.840
That's the only way to know,

02:39:47.840 --> 02:39:49.440
to really learn a movement.

02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:50.400
Yes.

02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:51.240
Well put.

02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:52.840
But the question is,

02:39:52.840 --> 02:39:55.320
can you have a small percentage of time

02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:57.200
when you go against a resisting opponent

02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:59.440
to get the wisdom and the insight of what it takes

02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:00.840
to perform that movement

02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:03.680
and you spend a large percentage of other time

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.960
just practicing the mechanics of it?

02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:06.800
So like,

02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:12.680
do you need to, as you get better and better at technique,

02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:15.320
to basically drift away completely from drilling

02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:17.880
and more into the sparring?

02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:20.040
I'd like to, I just...

02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:21.040
You like drilling?

02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:22.800
No, I don't like drilling.

02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:25.120
Well yes, I like drilling, I would say.

02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:26.880
But I just see, it always bothered me

02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:28.440
in the jiu-jitsu community,

02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:30.840
how few people really saw the value of drilling.

02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:31.680
I've seen it in wrestling,

02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:34.440
especially in the Russian style of wrestling,

02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:35.840
like the value of drilling.

02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:38.720
I don't necessarily mean that it's like a dead body

02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:40.520
or like a dummy or something like that,

02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:42.600
but just getting the reps in

02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:46.320
and really focusing on the high amount of reps.

02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:49.840
I agree in wrestling and judo.

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:51.520
I agree that drilling is very important.

02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:53.680
Initial drill a thousand times each move.

02:40:53.680 --> 02:40:55.320
Yeah, judo is a really big one for that too.

02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:00.320
It is, because it's the movement, the timing,

02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:03.440
it's the precision of the movement.

02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:06.840
It has to be perfectly, because it's one movement.

02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:09.560
Then you learn about the timing of the movement

02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:10.720
when you're fighting,

02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:12.800
you only need to know the time.

02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:15.080
Because your body movement is exactly the same

02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:16.080
when you drill.

02:41:16.080 --> 02:41:17.280
That's really well put, yeah.

02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:19.320
The mechanics is much more important there.

02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:22.080
Yeah, but it's completely different for jiu-jitsu.

02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:24.200
Because let's say from jiu-jitsu,

02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:26.160
like the arm lock, for example,

02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:27.680
we use that as an example.

02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:29.040
Let's see from the clothes guard.

02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:31.840
In my clothes guard, before I go for the arm lock,

02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:33.720
I need to have a set of grips.

02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:36.280
Let's say I have your collar and your arm, right?

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:38.320
And then, when you're drilling,

02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:39.400
I'm gonna grab your arm,

02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:40.760
I'm gonna grab your collar,

02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:42.120
and I'm gonna drill my body

02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:44.440
until I can apply the arm lock and finish.

02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:46.600
And I can do that a thousand times.

02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:49.680
Okay, now we're fighting, we start with the grip.

02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:51.880
The moment that I initiate the arm lock attack,

02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:54.560
you will defend the arm lock, it will not work.

02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:56.320
So it's not the one movement

02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:57.640
that will get me to attack the arm.

02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:00.440
There's a combination of all those things

02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:01.720
that I need to do.

02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:03.920
I need to feel about your weight,

02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:05.160
I need to get you close to it,

02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:07.320
there's so many other things involved

02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:11.480
that I need to feel that only comes with life,

02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:13.440
with a fully resistant opponent.

02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:18.040
Yeah, so pretty quickly it has to be live.

02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:18.880
Yeah.

02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:25.040
And then it comes how you practice, how you train.

02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:27.240
You're starting on that position

02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:29.000
and just saying, let's go.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.880
And the moment that we disengage from that position,

02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:34.560
we go back, that's when you really learn.

02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:36.080
Because everything that you do wrong,

02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:38.480
you're gonna go back there and you're gonna try again,

02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:39.640
try again, try again.

02:42:39.640 --> 02:42:42.840
And the repetition, it will teach you

02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:46.800
have a feeling of timing when to go,

02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:49.040
if there's other combinations

02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:52.240
which you always has to go with it.

02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:56.680
By the way, for the internet that's currently yelling at me

02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:59.640
for arguing with Haji Grace about drilling,

02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:03.080
that's called playing devil's advocate

02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:04.800
to strengthen, to explore ideas.

02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:06.440
I'm not actually arguing.

02:43:06.440 --> 02:43:07.280
Okay.

02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:10.320
I forgot to ask you,

02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:14.400
if you had to fight against the bear, lion, gorilla

02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.440
or anaconda to the death, which one would you choose

02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:23.120
and would you be able actually to win against any of them?

02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:28.120
Well, a bear, a lion, a tiger, or an anaconda.

02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:31.440
Oh, a gorilla too, gorilla, you can go gorilla.

02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:34.280
I'll probably choose the anaconda.

02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:36.440
I see.

02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:40.960
I mean, you're not allowed to run away though.

02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:42.600
So you're in a cage.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.480
Do you have to kill?

02:43:46.520 --> 02:43:47.840
Still the anaconda.

02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:49.080
Okay, so the other one.

02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:52.600
I think I have no chance against any of the ones.

02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:54.560
Zero chance, that's what John thinks.

02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:55.400
I think.

02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:57.600
I have a tiny little against the anaconda.

02:43:57.840 --> 02:43:58.840
The anaconda.

02:44:00.840 --> 02:44:02.400
Just wait it out.

02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:05.920
You don't think it's possible to be, I just,

02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:11.040
it feels like technique can do something

02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:13.520
against these animals, but they have so much strength,

02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:14.440
so much aggression.

02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:17.320
I mean, you know, the real naked joke

02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:20.040
translated into Portuguese is kill the lion.

02:44:21.120 --> 02:44:25.960
So ever since I was a kid, I always thought

02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:28.520
that maybe if I get behind a lion,

02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:31.000
the real naked joke, which, you know,

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.320
in Portuguese it says mata leão.

02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:36.200
So mata leão means kill the lion.

02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:38.640
So I always thought that that's the only way

02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:41.000
to kill a lion or to, you know,

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:42.040
if you're fighting against a lion,

02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:44.280
go behind and put the real naked joke,

02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:46.360
I think you put him to sleep.

02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:49.920
The name mata leão is like kill the lion.

02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:51.840
Someone came up with the name.

02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:52.680
Why?

02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:53.520
Somebody must have.

02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:55.960
Someone is going to fight with the lion,

02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:56.800
choke him up.

02:44:56.800 --> 02:44:57.640
There you go, John.

02:44:57.640 --> 02:44:58.840
There you go.

02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:00.800
I honestly, do you think, actually, yeah,

02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:03.320
you understand controlling positions.

02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:06.760
Do you think like animal, like a gorilla or a lion

02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:07.960
will shake you off?

02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:10.560
If you had back full, you're locked in.

02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:14.480
Well, I'll say the one that'll have the biggest chance

02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:15.880
of staying there is the lion,

02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:17.640
because it's just in their body.

02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:19.800
It's smaller than a tiger, I'll guess.

02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:21.520
Think tigers are bigger?

02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:22.480
Yes.

02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:24.440
So do you think they can shake you off, though?

02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:27.400
I think I'll have a bigger chance of staying

02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:30.200
against a lion's back than any other animal.

02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:31.680
Still not answering the question.

02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:33.440
Do you think you have a chance?

02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:35.760
If I start on the back?

02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:38.280
Yeah, start full locked in, full controls.

02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:39.600
Let's say it's a small enough lion

02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:41.440
that you can actually have a full.

02:45:41.440 --> 02:45:42.400
I'll guess so.

02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:44.680
I mean, I would like to believe so, okay.

02:45:45.800 --> 02:45:46.840
Well, just like you said,

02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:49.280
somebody must have been able to do it.

02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:51.000
Throughout your journey in jujitsu,

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.640
have there been low points?

02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:53.640
I guess there have been points

02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:55.720
where you really doubted yourself.

02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:58.240
No, I've never really doubted myself.

02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:00.960
There's low points in defeats.

02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:03.440
Those are the low points when I lost.

02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:05.000
How did you deal with defeats?

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.120
I just went back to the gym next week

02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:09.600
and said I need to get better.

02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:13.160
Every time I lost, I'm like, I need to get better

02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:15.440
because I need to choke them out.

02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:18.360
I need to submit them because, you know,

02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:20.000
I need to win by points.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:24.680
It's, as a black belt, I have very, very little loss.

02:46:26.040 --> 02:46:30.360
I would say, I mean, I don't like to sound like a crying baby,

02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:35.120
but I'll say most of those loss was very, very controversial.

02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:37.800
Yeah, it was not a dominant, clear performance.

02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:39.920
It's about referees and points and so on.

02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:42.600
Everything was, since I was very young,

02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:45.520
I always fought against my opponent and the referee.

02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:50.040
If there was ever in my whole life, since I was a kid,

02:46:50.040 --> 02:46:54.240
there was ever a doubt, you always go to my opponent.

02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:55.400
Always, always.

02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:57.280
That was just something that I had to deal with

02:46:57.280 --> 02:46:58.120
my whole life.

02:46:58.120 --> 02:46:59.880
Yeah, what's the motivation behind,

02:46:59.880 --> 02:47:02.160
what led to the fact that you win most of your matches

02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:03.800
by submission or in dominance?

02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:05.360
Like, are you chasing?

02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:08.560
Because that's the only way to prove you better.

02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:12.360
And I never fought to win tournaments.

02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:13.520
That was never my goal.

02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:16.920
That was the consequence of me trying to be the best.

02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:20.080
Like, I don't care how many titles I have.

02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:24.160
I care about, I need to beat all my opponents

02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:28.440
and not win because win is not enough.

02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:30.120
I have to submit them.

02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:34.360
That's the only way to prove I'm the best, to submit them.

02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:37.360
If I win by advantage or the point,

02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:39.160
that means I was better than them that day.

02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:41.160
That does not mean I'm better than them.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:49.000
If I take you down, pass your guard, mountain, submit you,

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.800
there's zero questions who's the best.

02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:54.040
Like, there's nothing you can say about it.

02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:57.600
If I foot sweep you, you put your butt on the floor,

02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:59.240
I get an advantage.

02:47:59.240 --> 02:48:01.160
We're carrying a fight and you're not winning.

02:48:01.160 --> 02:48:02.000
It means nothing.

02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:04.800
Not even means I'm better than you.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.960
And if that happened, that would haunt you?

02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:10.360
For me, it's not enough.

02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:11.200
It's not enough.

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:12.040
I wouldn't be happy.

02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:17.480
What advice would you give to young folks

02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:20.840
who look at you, who are able to accomplish

02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:22.960
from a place where you're not very good

02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:25.920
to becoming the best in the world at a thing?

02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:28.120
What advice would you give them

02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:30.000
to have a journey like that,

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.800
to have a journey where they could be successful

02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:36.040
in their career and their life to such a high level?

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.960
Determination is the most important thing.

02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:44.400
You need to know where you're going to get there.

02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:47.760
So you need to have a goal, whatever that goal is.

02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:50.720
Like, you need to set that goal for yourself

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:52.840
so you know where you wanna go.

02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:56.080
And to have the determination to get there

02:48:56.080 --> 02:49:01.000
and be sure that you will fail many times.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.960
Like, you cannot let your failures brings you down

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.120
because you will fail many times.

02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:09.160
Everybody does.

02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:14.040
So you said you didn't look to external sources of belief.

02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:17.840
You just believed in yourself.

02:49:17.840 --> 02:49:21.840
Is there something to that where you have to try to,

02:49:26.200 --> 02:49:28.560
be your own source of belief,

02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:32.080
flame the fire within yourself?

02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:34.080
Was that something difficult to do?

02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:36.760
That was just very natural for me.

02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:43.080
I said, you can surround yourself with great people.

02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:46.080
That is extremely important.

02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:48.600
Don't surround yourself with failures

02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:52.400
because they're not gonna push you to,

02:49:54.120 --> 02:49:57.160
they don't know what it is, how to get there.

02:49:57.160 --> 02:49:58.280
I mean, everybody knows,

02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:01.600
but it's when you surround yourself with winners,

02:50:02.480 --> 02:50:04.640
you will know what it took them to get there.

02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:06.160
Use them as an example.

02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:10.280
Yeah, there's a certain kind of aura to people

02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:13.040
that just achieve great things and being around them.

02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:15.320
But it's still, it's hard to find people that,

02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:16.800
especially at that early stage.

02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:18.640
Any area.

02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:19.480
Yeah.

02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:20.300
Any area.

02:50:20.300 --> 02:50:21.440
That's right.

02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:23.120
Yeah, greatness has a certain,

02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:25.040
I think it's almost humbling just to see,

02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:28.160
okay, any human, like at least that's a lesson I learned.

02:50:28.160 --> 02:50:31.520
Almost any human can do, can be great.

02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:35.400
I've used Muhammad Ali as a great example.

02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:37.200
Look at his belief.

02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.080
Look at how much he believed himself

02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:41.760
before he was Muhammad Ali.

02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:44.120
Look at the determination he had,

02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:46.920
the weight, the confidence he had fighting

02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:48.280
even on his loss.

02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:50.880
It never changed him.

02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:55.280
Not when he fought Foreman, George Foreman.

02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:58.320
Not one person in the world thought he was gonna win

02:50:58.320 --> 02:50:59.720
that fight by himself.

02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:02.800
He never doubted himself.

02:51:02.800 --> 02:51:04.040
Everybody else did.

02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:08.320
He won over all odds against him.

02:51:09.320 --> 02:51:12.240
So it's, I mean, when you look at people like that,

02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:14.480
you can, you don't have to be a boxer

02:51:14.480 --> 02:51:17.200
to try to follow his example.

02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:21.440
But see, those are like epic, giant battles.

02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:23.400
But I feel like you fight the same kind of battle

02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:26.560
when you're young and your parents tell you that,

02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.600
just with their whole energy, that this is silly.

02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:31.000
Don't be silly, don't be silly, they chase.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:32.480
It's harder.

02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:34.080
It is harder.

02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:36.960
But as a kid, it's harder to deal with that

02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:39.800
because, I mean, to go against adults,

02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:42.720
especially parents telling you otherwise,

02:51:42.720 --> 02:51:47.720
like the amount of strength you need is gigantic.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.200
I don't even know how much strength you need

02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:52.800
because that was not my case.

02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:56.160
So I can understand what you have to go through

02:51:56.160 --> 02:51:58.280
with the force of your parents telling you,

02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:03.040
otherwise, but it's how much you want,

02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:06.480
it will dictate how far you're gonna go,

02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:07.400
where you're gonna go.

02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:10.560
So it's, if you can break through that,

02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:13.080
you'll get nowhere, it's that simple.

02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:15.360
And actually, one of the really nice things

02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:18.360
the internet does that I would give advice to young people

02:52:18.360 --> 02:52:21.600
is like you can find, even if your parents

02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:24.400
are not a source of that, your teachers, your community,

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:26.800
you can find people on the internet who believe in you.

02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:27.640
It's kind of cool.

02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:30.440
It's kind of cool how the internet opens the possibility

02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:33.720
of like a community of like 10, 11 year olds,

02:52:33.720 --> 02:52:35.120
like building shit.

02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:37.520
I see this all the time, engineering,

02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:40.200
and they, I mean, they're fueled by belief.

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:44.840
They want to, they want to be like,

02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:47.960
they want to create the next trillion dollar company.

02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:50.720
Right, there's that fire in their eyes

02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:52.280
and not for the money, obviously,

02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:54.200
to do something with the impactful.

02:52:54.200 --> 02:52:56.640
And I think that fire is extinguished often

02:52:56.640 --> 02:53:00.520
by teachers and parents,

02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:02.960
because I think the logic that parents have,

02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:06.840
and teachers, they look at a kid

02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:09.360
and they don't, on the surface level,

02:53:09.360 --> 02:53:12.160
they don't see greatness, right?

02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:15.000
They just see kind of mediocrity.

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.240
And so to them, it's like, no, right,

02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:19.000
the world is more complicated than that.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.240
In order to get great, you have to,

02:53:21.240 --> 02:53:24.200
like, they somehow kind of always try

02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:25.800
to be reasonable with you,

02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:28.200
and in so doing, extinguish the flame, it's weird.

02:53:28.200 --> 02:53:33.200
I think most people are afraid, so, to even try.

02:53:34.080 --> 02:53:36.400
So you can call them cowards for not trying,

02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:39.560
because you are a coward for not trying,

02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:41.800
not putting yourself at risk, right?

02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:46.800
So I would say a big part of society

02:53:47.080 --> 02:53:49.440
are cowards for never trying,

02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:52.760
never pursuing what they really want.

02:53:52.760 --> 02:53:57.760
It's so, there is a weight, a pressure,

02:53:58.720 --> 02:54:01.320
everyone, most people, a lot of people,

02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:05.800
I'll say around you, that because they were afraid to try,

02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:09.360
they don't incentivize people to do so,

02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:13.080
because they want everybody to be like them.

02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:16.360
Because imagine if everybody around you

02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:18.960
suddenly are not afraid and everyone is trying,

02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:21.120
and you look yourself in the mirror and say,

02:54:21.120 --> 02:54:23.520
I was too scared, I've never tried.

02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:25.360
So you feel really bad about yourself.

02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:28.200
So it's easier to have people around you

02:54:28.200 --> 02:54:31.880
that think exactly like you than otherwise.

02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:34.480
So that reflect a lot on the kids.

02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:38.080
It's, you know, society almost like pressed them down

02:54:38.080 --> 02:54:41.760
to be like everybody else, to have a normal life,

02:54:41.760 --> 02:54:44.800
normal job, it's, you know, don't take risk,

02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:46.680
because you can't lose it all.

02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:49.880
I mean, that's the worst thing you can tell everybody,

02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:52.920
take all the risks, lose it all a few times.

02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:54.760
That's how you're gonna build things.

02:54:54.760 --> 02:54:55.800
Especially when you're young.

02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:56.640
Yes.

02:54:56.640 --> 02:54:57.480
You can recover much faster.

02:54:57.480 --> 02:54:59.880
Exactly, what's the point of not trying?

02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.960
You should try, and you will lose everything.

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:08.640
Doesn't matter what it matters to lose at everything.

02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:12.640
It does matter, it will teach you resilience,

02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:15.200
you know, try harder, go after.

02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:18.720
You know, it's, don't live a normal life,

02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:21.720
because otherwise, you know what we're here for.

02:55:21.720 --> 02:55:24.040
Yeah, take big risks, take a lot of them,

02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:25.240
fail and fail and fail and fail.

02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:27.760
Of course, fail you a thousand times,

02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:30.600
until you succeed, and then you're gonna,

02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:32.840
you'll be the most proud of yourself.

02:55:32.840 --> 02:55:36.040
Like, that's, that's, that's gonna be priceless.

02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:38.720
It's, that then will change the world.

02:55:38.720 --> 02:55:40.720
It is true that most people

02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:44.840
are not necessarily cowards, but have cowardice in them.

02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:47.760
It's, most people are just afraid to try, you know.

02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:49.440
And a lot of it comes from a place of love,

02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:54.440
because, you know, if you try and you fail, you get hurt.

02:55:59.040 --> 02:55:59.880
It hurts.

02:55:59.880 --> 02:56:02.320
I mean, it's not, it's not a pleasant thing to fail.

02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:03.960
I mean, you feel terrible.

02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:06.440
To think, you know, when I lost any tournament

02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:07.840
was a good thing.

02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:10.040
You know, I think when I was getting beat up

02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:12.560
by the gym over and over again was a good thing.

02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:14.120
When I was getting there and getting smashed

02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:16.880
by all the good guys, I think I liked it.

02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:18.520
Well, I hate it.

02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:20.280
But it's my resilience that, you know,

02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:22.760
make me carry on until I succeed.

02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:24.680
I think I like to get tapped.

02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:26.080
Well, I'm the most competitive,

02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:27.920
one of the most competitive persons you know.

02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:30.200
I hate to lose.

02:56:30.200 --> 02:56:32.240
But it's, I accept.

02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:35.280
I mean, I just need to get better.

02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:39.640
Every single time I lost in the championship, I hate it.

02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:40.880
I've never screamed.

02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:43.640
No one ever saw me screaming, shouting that, you know,

02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:44.880
I got robbed.

02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:47.320
You know, I should have won the referee.

02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:49.640
Yeah, boy, you know, screwed me over.

02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:52.280
I mean, it's okay.

02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:53.440
It happen.

02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:55.320
Shit happens.

02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:56.680
I need to get better.

02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:59.440
Because I don't want to be in that position ever again.

02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:02.160
So when I fight, if I'm better,

02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:04.880
if I tapped him, there's no question.

02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:06.360
I don't need to wait for the referee

02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:09.600
to decide that there's points or no points.

02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:14.120
His interpretation, that made me better.

02:57:14.120 --> 02:57:17.440
Because I was even more determined to be better.

02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:20.400
In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.

02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:21.680
Winning is not enough.

02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:25.200
It's just, objectively speaking,

02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:28.240
what you learn the most from

02:57:28.240 --> 02:57:31.840
is really wanting to succeed and then failing.

02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:35.560
And doing that often.

02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:36.960
That's the reality from a parent,

02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:38.880
from a teacher perspective, from anybody,

02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:40.480
from people you love.

02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:42.720
If they really want to do something,

02:57:42.720 --> 02:57:44.560
help them do that thing.

02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:46.520
If you think they're going to fail, good.

02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:48.880
Help them do that faster so they fail faster.

02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:49.720
Of course.

02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:50.560
They're going to learn.

02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:52.680
The only way to succeed is failing.

02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:53.840
There is no other way.

02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:55.920
That's what people have to understand.

02:57:55.920 --> 02:57:58.720
Without failing, there is no success.

02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:03.280
Since you've gotten a little softer,

02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:05.320
a little more emotionally open,

02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:07.480
what's the role of love in the human condition,

02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:08.680
Hajo Gracie?

02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:10.320
Probably the most important thing.

02:58:11.880 --> 02:58:13.680
That's the basic of everything, right?

02:58:14.680 --> 02:58:17.040
I mean, love brings the best of us.

02:58:17.040 --> 02:58:19.040
It's if we had more love and compassion

02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:22.400
from the other person,

02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:26.520
I think we would be a more evolved species.

02:58:26.520 --> 02:58:28.640
The world would be a much better place than it is now.

02:58:28.640 --> 02:58:31.200
Did Franz's family help you along the way?

02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:32.640
Yeah, a lot.

02:58:32.640 --> 02:58:35.760
I always had a lot of love and help from many people.

02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:36.680
That's why I succeed.

02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:38.320
Never got here by myself.

02:58:39.160 --> 02:58:42.040
I had a lot of people who loved me,

02:58:42.040 --> 02:58:45.320
believed in me, and helped me get to be here today.

02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:48.240
Well, I'm glad they did.

02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:49.280
I'm glad you're here today.

02:58:49.280 --> 02:58:50.160
I'm a huge fan.

02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:51.840
It was an honor to meet you.

02:58:51.840 --> 02:58:54.280
It was an honor to hang out with you in Vegas,

02:58:54.280 --> 02:58:56.160
to hang out with you again today.

02:58:56.160 --> 02:58:58.560
I've just been a huge fan for a long time.

02:58:58.560 --> 02:58:59.400
My pleasure, man.

02:58:59.400 --> 02:59:00.800
Thank you for everything you're doing.

02:59:00.800 --> 02:59:02.240
Thank you for this conversation.

02:59:02.240 --> 02:59:03.080
It was awesome.

02:59:03.080 --> 02:59:04.040
Thank you very much.

02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:06.440

02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:15.920
from Haji Gracie himself.

02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:18.320
Jiu-Jitsu is simple.

02:59:18.320 --> 02:59:19.920
You just have to do it right.

02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:23.920
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
