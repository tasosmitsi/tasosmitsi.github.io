WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
he made me think that you know everything was going to be reversed and okay and anybody that

00:05.360 --> 00:10.000
money was borrowed from they would get it back you know maybe tenfold and so it was this weird

00:10.000 --> 00:17.840
situation of having like one foot in his reality and potentially believing the things he was saying

00:17.840 --> 00:23.840
or even over time wanting to believe them more and more because the alternative was so

00:24.720 --> 00:31.120
the alternative was worse the alternative was like was increasingly a bigger and bigger nightmare.

00:33.360 --> 00:39.120
The following is a conversation with Sarma Melangelis, a chef and restaurateur who was

00:39.120 --> 00:46.480
the subject of the Netflix documentary Bad Vegan, Fame, Fraud, and Fugitives that documents the rise

00:46.480 --> 00:52.960
and fall of her vegan raw food restaurants in New York City that ended in what she called a road

00:52.960 --> 00:58.240
trip from hell being arrested in Tennessee her pleading guilty for stealing over two million

00:58.240 --> 01:06.560
dollars and serving four months at Rikers Island jail. Sarma disputes the veracity of the documentary

01:06.560 --> 01:13.040
and its conclusions saying that she was misrepresented so I wanted to talk to her

01:13.040 --> 01:19.280
to get the full story and to seek understanding of who she is as a human being the good and the bad.

01:20.160 --> 01:25.840
This is the Lex Fridman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description

01:25.840 --> 01:32.800
and now to your friends here's Sarma Melangelis. You've said that you did a lot of reading when

01:32.800 --> 01:39.280
you were growing up and you mentioned Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson so

01:39.280 --> 01:45.680
from the reading you've done in those early days how did you see the world was it to you a beautiful

01:46.080 --> 01:53.040
place or a cruel place? I don't think I thought about the world. You were focused on family

01:53.040 --> 01:58.400
just basic day-to-day life? I think I was focused on day-to-day. I had an awareness of not fitting

01:58.400 --> 02:05.440
in but I think back then it felt like something was wrong versus some people are just that way

02:06.640 --> 02:13.840
and speaking of books I read a book called Party of One by a woman named Anneli Rufus that somebody

02:13.840 --> 02:18.960
gave me and suggested I read and that helped a lot that was that was one book that made me feel

02:18.960 --> 02:26.480
like it made me understand things from the past that I hadn't understood before specifically

02:26.480 --> 02:30.880
kind of feeling out of place even among my family which is where you're not supposed to feel out of

02:30.880 --> 02:35.840
place. Yeah I'm not sure where I saw it but I think you mentioned that you were a bit of a loner

02:35.840 --> 02:44.320
and I also think I saw somewhere pictures of you with the with green hair in high school

02:44.320 --> 02:50.160
and a wild haircut. What was that about? Is that real? Am I just imagining? No you're not

02:50.160 --> 02:58.240
imagining it. It's strange because I was kind of a loner so it'd be strange to do something that

02:58.240 --> 03:02.880
calls so much attention to yourself because back then I mean I grew up in a suburb of Boston

03:03.760 --> 03:11.440
in Newton and anybody that was there around that time probably if you said you know that girl with

03:11.440 --> 03:15.840
green hair or blue hair was blue most of the time they would remember like seeing me walking down

03:15.840 --> 03:19.760
the street because it stood out like crazy especially back then now it wouldn't stand out

03:19.760 --> 03:28.000
so much but back then it really stood out so I was trying to think about why I did that when

03:28.880 --> 03:36.400
I was kind of shy and on the one hand wouldn't want to bring attention to myself but I did

03:36.400 --> 03:45.520
something that did and it wasn't my family to their credit they were fine with it so it wasn't

03:45.520 --> 03:49.680
a rebellion against them or anything like that they were fine with it I don't think they loved

03:49.680 --> 03:58.240
it but your dad was a physicist at MIT yes so so he was he was cool with your with your green hair

03:58.240 --> 04:02.560
when you're a rebellion that's just the way of life he was fine with the green hair but I think

04:02.560 --> 04:08.080
in some ways maybe they had to be fine with it because I didn't cause problems otherwise and

04:09.120 --> 04:17.120
I got good grades in school I was a very low maintenance child I think even with the green

04:17.120 --> 04:25.440
hair so Hunter S. Thompson wrote a lot of good stuff he has a lot of just brilliant quotes a

04:25.440 --> 04:32.800
lot of brilliant lines so one of the ones I love is life should not be a journey to the grave

04:32.800 --> 04:37.920
with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body but rather to skid in

04:37.920 --> 04:46.640
broadside in a cloud of smoke thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow

04:46.640 --> 04:53.840
what a ride what do you think about that is that good life advice from Hunter S. Thompson I think

04:53.840 --> 05:03.840
so I think he followed it right somewhere I heard recently what he consumed in a day yeah and it was

05:04.400 --> 05:09.040
kind of astonishing it's funny I when I was in college there were always really interesting

05:09.040 --> 05:14.320
people coming through speakers and whatnot and I tended to not go to events and whatnot but in the

05:14.320 --> 05:18.240
four years I was there the I mean really interesting people came through and gave

05:18.240 --> 05:25.680
talks you know I don't know just a lot of famous people and but then one day Hunter S. Thompson

05:25.680 --> 05:31.440
came to speak and it was the only one I attended oh wow that was the only interesting person who

05:31.440 --> 05:36.560
came to speak on the campus that I attended was Hunter S. Thompson and he had a you know he had

05:36.560 --> 05:43.040
a glass of whatever it was whiskey and I don't remember a whole lot about it but it was it was

05:43.040 --> 05:48.720
entertaining and yeah I mean later in his life he started making less and less sense

05:48.720 --> 05:54.320
but he was still somehow like embodying the the crazy that he represented throughout his life the

05:54.320 --> 05:58.640
boldness the fearlessness the wildness all that kind of stuff and we'll talk about Johnny Depp a

05:58.640 --> 06:06.560
little bit too funny enough there's like a echo obviously he Johnny Depp played him or he starred

06:06.560 --> 06:11.360
in feel and loathing and they hung out together and it just seemed to somehow like the universe

06:11.440 --> 06:17.440
rhymes in these two individuals they're both mad men and in different kind of ways so you also told

06:17.440 --> 06:24.160
me that Leon the Professional is one of your favorite films it's also the reason you named

06:24.160 --> 06:30.400
your dog Leon so what do you find beautiful and powerful about this film I've watched it a bunch

06:30.400 --> 06:35.920
of times but it's been a while since I've watched it so for people who haven't watched it it there's

06:35.920 --> 06:46.320
a guy named Leon played by Jean Reno there's a young girl I don't know 13 14 Matilda played

06:46.320 --> 06:54.320
by Natalie Portman and she's abused she has a really hard life her parents are spoiler alert

06:55.040 --> 07:08.480
murdered and then she finds protection under this fella Leon who also happens to be a professional

07:08.480 --> 07:15.840
assassin and he is also kind of a Forrest Gump type character like he's a really simple

07:15.840 --> 07:23.120
simple human he almost he seems to be like the immature one or like rather the one who's young

07:23.120 --> 07:28.800
and she seems to have a wisdom far beyond her age because of the hard life she had to live

07:28.800 --> 07:34.960
through and then they're here huddling together from the cruelty of the world

07:36.240 --> 07:41.440
and finding connection yeah I think it's one of those films where there's so many interesting

07:41.440 --> 07:46.080
things about it but you know I'm sure one of them is just the contradiction of him being

07:47.840 --> 07:52.800
a caring person and reluctant to get attached to her you know he tries to I think he knows

07:53.440 --> 08:00.400
he's very reluctant to get attached to her in the beginning and so you see all of his humanity

08:00.400 --> 08:06.000
but yet he's also an assassin that kills people so that's interesting and I think

08:07.440 --> 08:11.120
probably a psychoanalyst would have a field day with why I like that movie so much

08:11.920 --> 08:17.280
and I haven't necessarily I haven't gone there myself but there's something I think about she

08:17.280 --> 08:24.320
she even in the brief part that depicts her in the beginning it seems clear that she's sort of

08:24.320 --> 08:33.520
out of place in her family and then yeah there's all kinds of interesting things about their

08:33.520 --> 08:38.480
relationship along the way what I like about that movie and I had to think about it recently

08:38.480 --> 08:44.800
because I've read stuff about it that bothered me or it bothered me the fact that I haven't

08:44.800 --> 08:49.680
really thought about it before for people haven't watched the movie so here's a young

08:49.680 --> 08:57.200
underage girl who kind of comes on to him first of all I think she actually just doesn't know what

08:58.240 --> 09:06.240
like familial love is so this is the only way she knows how to express love that's one and two is

09:07.360 --> 09:11.120
you know a lot of bad people in this world would take advantage of that

09:12.000 --> 09:18.240
right and the fact that she finally met a human being who doesn't

09:19.760 --> 09:23.760
and is just there to protect her that's a real sort of

09:26.080 --> 09:30.800
I don't know a powerful statement of what it means to be sort of like a father figure

09:30.800 --> 09:39.280
I suppose a protector so that that to me I love the idea of being that sort of the the protector

09:39.360 --> 09:46.400
that there's something like something worthwhile in this world to protect amidst all the cruelty

09:46.400 --> 09:53.600
that's all around so that's that's a beautiful kind of you're basically saving this young human's

09:56.080 --> 09:59.920
or you're repairing this young human's path

10:00.640 --> 10:00.960
path

10:04.560 --> 10:12.480
to love to real love in life because that idea of love was destroyed for her just family everything

10:12.480 --> 10:21.200
is is everything is sort of everything around is broken and he's kind of repairing it by

10:21.200 --> 10:26.560
re-establishing what that kind of love can be I don't know and the plant they've said they

10:27.200 --> 10:32.960
saved the plant also well there's also just the simple the simplicity of the film just

10:32.960 --> 10:39.200
from a cinematic perspective is beautiful the music the way it looks the minimalism even the

10:39.200 --> 10:47.520
violence was beautiful yeah violence it was over the top and also the the bad guy the bad cop played

10:47.520 --> 10:54.320
by Gary Oldman yeah he was amazing yeah I think he was listening to Beethoven or something like

10:54.320 --> 11:00.640
that and he'd taken some sort of pills and drugs and some kind and so there was a kind of like a

11:00.640 --> 11:07.600
like it's part of the orchestra like the violence was part of the of some kind of musical creation

11:08.800 --> 11:15.280
yeah it's interesting because I turn away from violence or films usually that have

11:15.280 --> 11:22.560
violence or tv or anything that has that sort of element to it except in certain cases where

11:24.560 --> 11:31.680
where the violence is beautiful yeah yeah or um did you see the movie true romance

11:32.480 --> 11:38.400
uh yes that's my second favorite movie okay that's probably my favorite movie yeah oh well

11:38.400 --> 11:43.680
interesting yeah that's my second favorite movie um that's that's a more uh simple kind of love

11:43.680 --> 11:49.360
but also with the violence that is beautiful yeah as you could say yeah and my um my favorite scene

11:49.360 --> 11:54.560
is the one with Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini oh yeah where she there's a shotgun

11:54.560 --> 12:01.360
involved yeah yeah and then it actually makes me cry every time I see it for some reason

12:05.200 --> 12:11.600
so for people who haven't seen the film I think I think he's actually I think he's hitting her

12:12.400 --> 12:19.280
or um like there's blood and violence and so on because he's resisting being murdered yeah

12:19.280 --> 12:25.280
there's a lot of violence and then you know he throws her into the glass um the shower yeah

12:25.840 --> 12:32.160
thing and she's all cut up and beat up and only and she laughs yeah there's just so much passion

12:32.160 --> 12:38.160
in it you know she's she knows she's gonna or in that moment she knows or thinks she knows that

12:38.160 --> 12:43.600
she's gonna die anyway yeah because she she knows he's gonna kill her yeah so she kind of gives it

12:43.600 --> 12:52.160
her gives it all she has and um but she also just has guts she's not afraid yeah well and also she's

12:52.160 --> 12:59.440
um you know she loves Clarence yeah the love comes through through that violence yeah yeah just like

12:59.440 --> 13:07.680
Clarence her fella in that film uh has the same kind of thing when he visits well it was Gary

13:07.680 --> 13:13.280
Oldman again it was Gary Oldman again that's right the pimp looking very Drexel Drexel yeah

13:13.280 --> 13:20.160
yeah and he's also fearless in that interaction saying she's now mine it's interesting that movie

13:20.160 --> 13:26.320
so romantic and that happy ending spoiler alert in a way that's what I like about it too because I

13:26.320 --> 13:30.640
I feel like some movies should come with I don't want to watch a movie if it's going to be

13:30.640 --> 13:36.160
devastating usually unless it's worthwhile in some other way but I'm kind of sensitive and I don't

13:36.160 --> 13:43.840
want um I don't like movies that have a terrible ending you know I mean I was there's a book I read

13:43.840 --> 13:48.720
because it got so many good reviews and the very last scene the woman steps in front of a train and

13:48.720 --> 14:00.960
it was like um so I'm partial to movies with happy endings Leon ends with loss Leon the movie right

14:01.040 --> 14:07.760
but it's still inspiring a love persists in some kind of form yeah persists and the plant

14:09.360 --> 14:16.480
and the plant um okay sure sure uh true romance does have one of the I mean it's probably unhealthy

14:16.480 --> 14:22.080
the ending scene is just amazing you're so cool was she is that one the one where she just kind of

14:22.880 --> 14:29.680
looks at uh Clarence and her son and child or whatever and she's saying you're so cool you're

14:29.680 --> 14:38.240
so cool yeah that's that's love I just that movie has so much in it because it's you know it's funny

14:38.240 --> 14:45.680
and there's so many so many good actors in that film and Brad Pitt uh plays in that film a pivotal

14:45.680 --> 14:51.600
role of pothead on couch yeah they're just they're all so good and funny and Michael Rappaport yeah

14:51.600 --> 14:56.320
and um and even Val Kilmer people don't realize he's in the movie because he doesn't look like

14:56.320 --> 15:04.000
himself um wait what did Val Kilmer's in the very end it's um you know when he's there's like the

15:04.000 --> 15:11.680
Elvis sitting there yeah talking to him in the end yeah that's Val Kilmer yeah you don't notice

15:11.680 --> 15:17.680
it unless you yeah somehow either are very perceptive or noticed it in the credits yeah

15:17.680 --> 15:24.720
and uh Quentin Tarantino wrote the film I think yes which is interesting uh directed by Tony Scott

15:24.720 --> 15:34.160
and the music is uh beautiful too and Christopher Walken and um um Dennis Hopper Dennis Hopper

15:34.160 --> 15:42.480
Dennis Hopper plays Clarence's dad uh dad and they have this very racist sounding scene but the big

15:43.680 --> 15:51.520
uh important aspect of that scene is it's a father willing to die to protect the son I mean it's so

15:51.520 --> 15:59.200
much so much beautiful violence there is there is I love that film so much uh and she's a prostitute

15:59.200 --> 16:07.200
or not really part-time short time no it was her first time first time yeah okay and he saved her

16:08.880 --> 16:17.440
and uh hmm my third favorite film has no violence whatsoever what's your third um

16:17.440 --> 16:26.480
a room with a view I feel like you'd like it it's um um I forget the author it's a book and I

16:26.480 --> 16:35.920
I read the book much later um but it's um Helena Bonham Carter and um uh Daniel Day-Lewis

16:37.040 --> 16:44.240
is in it and Julian Sands Daniel Day-Lewis is a fascinating character he's amazing in this

16:44.240 --> 16:51.440
film because he plays he's very funny he sort of plays a he's a comical character which is unlike

16:52.080 --> 16:59.120
most of what he does I think I don't watch a ton of movies so um but yeah he played his his

16:59.120 --> 17:06.640
role is funny well that's a that's a heck of a top three uh you you brought me some books

17:06.720 --> 17:13.840
some bread and books yeah some Russian bread Russian inspired bread yeah I mean it's Latvian

17:13.840 --> 17:20.080
but it's similar to close enough similar to what's made in Russia and it's made at a Russian bakery

17:20.080 --> 17:24.640
and where your dad is from right my dad is from Latvia yeah so you got me some books

17:25.760 --> 17:30.720
beautiful ruins yeah and if you never read them who cares that's totally fine you know people give

17:30.720 --> 17:36.480
you books and then you feel like you just you're you sort of feel like I see this is we'll talk

17:36.480 --> 17:42.800
about this this is part therapy session I don't feel the need to to satisfy people's happiness

17:42.800 --> 17:49.600
that's a good thing okay so but they it could also be a um an opportunity to experience something

17:49.600 --> 17:56.400
I never otherwise would have so beautiful ruins it's a book that made me laugh and cry and it's

17:56.400 --> 18:03.520
just a happy story and for some reason I don't know exactly why but for some reason um when you

18:03.520 --> 18:09.520
asked me to come for it just I thought oh I'm gonna bring a copy of that book that's you just

18:09.520 --> 18:15.920
felt it came the voice told you yeah there's others darkness visible these are more a memoir

18:15.920 --> 18:23.360
of madness compelling harrowing a vivid portrait of a debilitating disorder it offers the solace

18:23.360 --> 18:30.320
of shared experience the New York Times this is there's a little bit about this book that reminds

18:30.320 --> 18:39.760
me of um the Carl Dysaroth book because he writes about his own condition and um I mean he's an

18:39.760 --> 18:45.040
amazing writer so he writes about it in this beautiful way and oddly enough in some ways it's

18:45.040 --> 18:50.800
kind of delightful so it's not at all a depressing book at least I didn't find it depressing at all

18:50.800 --> 18:58.160
I don't think it is um but he writes about his own experience with depression in such a beautiful

18:58.160 --> 19:07.600
way um my own copy is full of underlines um I would love that copy too I would love to look

19:07.600 --> 19:13.920
into the underlines and the and then the books with notes those little secrets that people leave

19:13.920 --> 19:19.440
that's part of why I like paper books is because I underline I tend to underline like crazy the

19:19.440 --> 19:25.680
the Carl Dysaroth book is full of underlines too well I do the same thing on Kindle but um

19:25.680 --> 19:28.880
and then you can actually more effectively go back to the things you've underlined because you

19:28.880 --> 19:36.720
highlight and so on but in fact when you underline in on paper books you sometimes never go back

19:37.600 --> 19:42.240
which just always makes me sad to the book to the things you've underlined in the paper books

19:42.240 --> 19:46.960
yeah in the paper book oh I do I go back yeah I go back a lot do you wonder what what the heck

19:46.960 --> 19:52.000
you were thinking about when you wrote something no well sometimes I underline things that are well

19:52.000 --> 19:59.040
also what I do is I have a whole file in Evernote of transcribed quotes from books ones that I want

19:59.040 --> 20:05.200
to save so I might underline a lot of things in a book and then maybe like a third of them I want

20:05.200 --> 20:10.960
to write them down somewhere so I I write those down and I think even the time it takes to transcribe

20:10.960 --> 20:17.760
it is somehow worthwhile it's like searing it in your brain and um and you're reliving the memory

20:17.760 --> 20:24.160
having it read it the first time yeah and then sometimes I'll pick up books I even um and sometimes

20:24.160 --> 20:29.120
I just underline sentences that are it's not the content of the sentence it's more that it's just

20:29.120 --> 20:33.200
a beautifully written sentence or like a particularly apt metaphor or something that's

20:33.840 --> 20:39.760
that's really nice um and I like paper books too because I bought Beautiful Ruins I would have

20:39.760 --> 20:45.440
never heard of it I don't think except one of my favorite things is to go to used bookstores

20:46.400 --> 20:53.200
actually Goodwill sometimes has really good big book selections and depending on the area where

20:53.200 --> 21:00.000
you go um sometimes you find a lot of treasures there and what ends up happening a lot is I end

21:00.000 --> 21:04.800
up buying books that I know sometimes also because I lost all my belongings at one point so all very

21:04.800 --> 21:11.760
often buy books that I've already read just to have them and um but then what always ends up

21:11.760 --> 21:16.560
happening is I'll find there'll be a couple of books that I buy that I've never heard of the

21:16.560 --> 21:20.320
author I don't really know anything about I don't know anything about the book at all but something

21:20.320 --> 21:25.680
drew me to it and what I like about that is you're buying you're buying used books so it costs a

21:25.680 --> 21:31.600
dollar or two so if you made a mistake like no big deal who cares so but every time I come back

21:31.600 --> 21:39.200
with a book haul there's usually at least one gem that I end up loving and I'm so glad that I read

21:39.200 --> 21:44.240
it and Beautiful Ruins was that book for me and I was drawn to it because of the cover art like

21:44.240 --> 21:49.680
I just loved I just loved the cover and the colors and um and then I picked it up and read the back

21:49.680 --> 21:55.680
and bought it and um I also feel bad sometimes buying used books when the author is still alive

21:55.680 --> 22:00.720
because I feel like if you write a book you should get the the royalties so um

22:01.920 --> 22:07.440
but you get to live with that regret well also I mean I'll usually end up putting a picture of

22:07.440 --> 22:11.920
Leon reading the book online and then other people buy it and read it and so I feel like

22:11.920 --> 22:17.520
I've made up for you make up for it I've made up for depriving him of the the royalties I used to

22:17.520 --> 22:23.840
live in Cambridge Massachusetts I know it well I used to hang out of the pit in Harvard Square with

22:23.840 --> 22:29.680
my green and blue hair when I was very way too young to be doing that by myself and there's a

22:29.680 --> 22:37.360
guy that I think has been there for a long time sort of between uh Kendall and Central that would

22:37.360 --> 22:44.800
just lay out used books and sell them and I always loved that guy whoever he was he had a cool hat

22:44.800 --> 22:51.200
he's an older gentleman and you could just tell he's seen some things I don't know who he is I

22:51.200 --> 22:56.720
always wanted to actually like talk to him for a long time but I was too afraid maybe because

22:56.720 --> 23:01.280
I wouldn't be able to handle what he had to tell me I don't because I almost wanted to maintain

23:01.280 --> 23:06.960
the innocence of just okay here's this guy but he's he was so every time you would ask him a

23:06.960 --> 23:11.120
question about a book first of all he's read all of them oh that's interesting which means he's

23:11.120 --> 23:18.960
traveled quite a few places inside these worlds and then you would tell him I would look at a book

23:18.960 --> 23:24.160
right and you you just he would catch you being curious about it and then he would walk up to you

23:24.160 --> 23:29.680
and then he would start talking about the book and he would always forget that you were there he's

23:29.680 --> 23:35.760
almost like he's not trying to sell you the books talking to himself yeah yeah yeah like almost like

23:35.760 --> 23:40.880
an ex-girlfriend he's visiting through this book or something did you buy books from him yeah yeah

23:40.880 --> 23:46.880
definitely but the experience of just just being there because he lays them out and people actually

23:46.880 --> 23:50.880
that watch or listen to this probably would be able to tell me what his name is because I'd love

23:50.880 --> 23:55.920
to find that guy again I'm sure he's still there maybe you'll have him on the podcast I would 100

23:55.920 --> 24:03.280
will but this it's almost terrifying I'm not sure I can handle because he's been through some things

24:03.280 --> 24:09.840
I'm not sure if he's homeless or or just looks like it yep that's sometimes a thing

24:10.800 --> 24:18.160
and some of my favorite people either are homeless or look like it so okay what's the third one

24:18.880 --> 24:25.360
the confession of a sociopath by M.E. Thomas a life spent hiding in plain sight it's a book I

24:25.360 --> 24:32.240
recommend a lot because I've read a lot about sociopathy and I've read all the books by

24:32.320 --> 24:40.720
psychologists and this one's written by a woman who understands herself that she is a sociopath

24:40.720 --> 24:45.440
and so it's beautifully written but I learned I learned more from that book than from any other

24:45.440 --> 24:52.400
book and I think I thought about a long time ago I think a lot of conversations you've talked a lot

24:52.400 --> 25:00.480
about good and evil and you know whether everybody's really good or some people are not good and I think

25:00.480 --> 25:07.120
sociopathy is something that I think the world needs to understand much better and so that

25:07.120 --> 25:10.480
that book helped me understand a lot and it's beautifully written and she

25:11.360 --> 25:18.000
tackles all the really interesting moral questions like you know like what if we were able to

25:19.520 --> 25:25.520
definitively diagnose people in some way like there was a you could immediately identify

25:26.240 --> 25:33.040
who's a full-blown sociopath and then what as a society would you do with them because in most

25:33.040 --> 25:40.080
cases you know they're just going to cause destruction and pain and harm and or potentially

25:40.080 --> 25:49.280
rise to power and become president or something so I just found that book fascinating

25:50.160 --> 25:57.200
and we'll return to this idea because it's fascinating we'll return to human psychology

25:57.200 --> 26:06.000
and human nature but let's go through um let's go through the timeline of your life let's take

26:06.000 --> 26:13.520
a stroll so uh you wrote that the documentary about you called bad vegan fame fraud fugitives

26:13.520 --> 26:19.440
is not a documentary you got some things right some things wrong and some were quote

26:19.440 --> 26:28.000
disturbingly misleading so let's go through and get things right today um first can I give you a

26:28.000 --> 26:37.200
whirlwind summary the way I understand it and also for context of people so 2004 you Matthew Kenny

26:38.000 --> 26:44.400
and Jeffrey Chattero opened pure foods and wine in New York City did I say their names correctly

26:44.400 --> 26:51.520
pure food and wine no they're theirs well yeah Matthew Kenny and Jeffrey Chattero yeah yeah so

26:51.520 --> 26:58.320
it's uh and I'll ask about what it takes to to to to launch and run a restaurant in New York City

26:58.320 --> 27:05.040
that's a fascinating story in itself so it's an upscale raw food restaurant all right that's 2004

27:05.040 --> 27:12.000
2007 you opened one lucky duck juice and takeaway and then second and third locations in 2009 and

27:12.000 --> 27:25.440
14 uh all of those things close in uh 2016 15 16 15 and 16 okay all right 2009 Jeffrey lends you

27:25.440 --> 27:32.720
2.1 million dollars to buy the business outright and Matthew is out Matthew was out earlier than

27:32.720 --> 27:39.920
that and then time passed time passed and I had um what was complicated is I had started the one

27:39.920 --> 27:47.520
lucky duck brand on my own um at first it was a dot com that was doing like delivery it was a it

27:47.520 --> 27:52.880
was a dot com where people could order ingredients and things and all of the products that we made

27:52.880 --> 27:57.520
and packaged so we made a bunch of cookies and snacks and things that were I think different

27:57.520 --> 28:04.080
and if I may say so myself better than other um strong words products out there

28:05.120 --> 28:09.760
yeah but then about the cookies but I feel like I can brag about our food and products because

28:10.640 --> 28:16.240
um I wasn't oh you know a few recipes you know recipes early on I came up with but it was um

28:16.960 --> 28:24.240
the people that worked with me that created really good recipes and products and I was just kind of

28:24.240 --> 28:33.920
there um curating it all or um helping to get it out there what was your favorite thing that you've

28:33.920 --> 28:40.400
created maybe yourself eat that not you created but this whole all of these efforts have created

28:40.400 --> 28:46.960
in terms of meal like you said cookies what are we talking about here question um I mean just okay

28:46.960 --> 28:51.840
not the favorite but like something that pops into memory that brought you joy the malomar

28:52.640 --> 28:58.640
everybody loved the malomar it was so very often we made like raw vegan versions of things that

28:58.640 --> 29:05.520
people are um familiar with so it was a I think it was pecans it was like a salty

29:06.320 --> 29:10.000
cookie made with nuts and then covered in chocolate and then there's a big blob of

29:10.640 --> 29:18.080
coconut cream um I love coconut which it didn't taste coconutty um our ice cream was made with a

29:18.080 --> 29:24.000
coconut also it's like the meat from coconuts pureed and then there's some soaked cashews in

29:24.000 --> 29:29.680
there but anyway it was a blob of vanilla flavored cream kind of like a uh you know like a healthy

29:29.680 --> 29:34.880
natural version of fluff I don't know if you're familiar with fluff uh basically every single

29:34.880 --> 29:40.640
word you say I'm not familiar with you should see my diet I don't it's like steak and vegetables

29:40.640 --> 29:45.840
a fluff is like a thing that I remember it from my childhood like peanut butter and fluff is a

29:45.840 --> 29:50.160
ridiculously delicious combination is it fluffy or is it it's like a marshmallow it's basically

29:50.160 --> 29:57.360
like like if you softened marshmallows and made it into a luxurious amazing goo also it's like a

29:57.360 --> 30:02.880
fancy and then put it in a jar okay and then it's just spreadable it's spreadable marshmallows kind

30:02.880 --> 30:09.360
of oh I see I think that's yeah so spreadable marshmallows got it yeah so there's a big blob

30:09.360 --> 30:14.720
I didn't know that existed that's a thing fluff fluff I know does everyone for you do people

30:14.720 --> 30:21.360
know about this oh yeah everybody knows people I mean I think so people know about fluff and see

30:21.360 --> 30:27.600
I think I went I I took the road less traveled by you know I went to the peanut butter and the

30:27.600 --> 30:34.560
tala road in terms of spreadable things Nutella is like the chocolate version and then fluff is

30:34.560 --> 30:40.880
like the vanilla equivalent sort of cool but I think commercial fluff that you buy in the store

30:40.880 --> 30:48.000
is just like sugar and whatever else they put in there anyway it's not actually fluffy it's

30:48.000 --> 30:55.600
it's kind of fluffy okay but it's wet because Nutella is it's like fluffy yeah it's it so

30:55.600 --> 31:02.320
it's like Nutella if you whipped it and then kind of got a little bit like a little bit aerated

31:02.320 --> 31:08.560
okay so it's a bit more fluffy so fluff was a part of the formula here so this but so the the

31:08.560 --> 31:17.440
coconut cream that we made was like a healthy version of fluff oh kind of nice except it would

31:17.440 --> 31:23.760
you know you could make a a quenelle like a like a little scoop of it and it would stay in that

31:23.760 --> 31:30.560
form malamars were refrigerated and then there's like chocolate drizzled over that so it had that

31:30.560 --> 31:38.320
like salty sweet thing going on that was probably my favorite that's a dessert yeah it was like a

31:39.280 --> 31:43.680
dessert snack it wasn't as you wouldn't order it on the restaurant menu but in the takeaway you

31:43.680 --> 31:50.960
could get them or sometimes some people would get them shipped on dry ice and pay a lot of money

31:51.600 --> 31:57.280
like a lot of money to have them shipped on dry ice people are funny I know I kind of want to

31:57.280 --> 32:02.080
like name drop because it was Tom Brady used to order them oh that's awesome yeah they would

32:02.080 --> 32:13.040
order those shipped on ice to Boston oh yeah continuing on in 2011 you meet Anthony

32:13.040 --> 32:20.240
Stranges on Twitter and then in real life also around this time I think before you got your

32:20.240 --> 32:28.320
rescue dog a pit bull named Leon yeah 2011 2010 do you remember um it was September 2010 so because

32:28.320 --> 32:35.120
I think he was born roughly around March I gave him a designated birthday of March 10 2010 why is

32:35.120 --> 32:42.080
that why why March 10th I wrote about the story of adopting him on my website a long time ago and

32:42.080 --> 32:47.760
then I reposted it here on my current website and um what happened I got weirdly obsessed with

32:48.480 --> 32:54.800
Leon before he was Leon he was a dog in a shelter named Quinn and I couldn't stop thinking about

32:54.800 --> 33:00.320
him and the him specifically him specifically he saw him and there's something very special about

33:00.320 --> 33:06.480
him I was trying to convince somebody else to adopt a dog so and I Alec Baldwin yeah and it

33:06.480 --> 33:13.360
didn't occur to me that I like how you didn't name drop him but you named Tom Brady I like it

33:15.760 --> 33:20.480
so I was trying to convince him to get a dog because I thought you know he should have a dog

33:21.200 --> 33:25.520
I saw Leon's picture and just got weirdly obsessed with it in a way that I couldn't

33:25.520 --> 33:30.320
really explain and um I was laying in bed one night and thinking I just couldn't stop thinking

33:30.320 --> 33:39.680
about him um the dog and the paper were or the his description in the shelter bio said that he was

33:39.680 --> 33:44.720
roughly five months old or however whatever it gave us his age I went back and it it would have

33:44.720 --> 33:52.080
been March 20 would have been March of that year that he was born and um I had a cat that

33:52.080 --> 33:57.280
I was particularly attached to I had two cats brother and sister but the the boy cat we had

33:57.280 --> 34:02.000
sort of like a something that felt like a you know like we'd look at each other and

34:03.200 --> 34:08.880
like there was something there I don't know what it was but um and in fact when he got sick I knew

34:08.880 --> 34:12.960
it before he even had any symptoms it was like something in the way that he looked at me I knew

34:12.960 --> 34:21.920
something was wrong and then uh was it friendship was it like uh was there a power dynamic cats

34:21.920 --> 34:29.680
seem to not really give a fuck yeah they seem to dismiss you it's usually yeah your your entire

34:29.680 --> 34:36.400
worth as a human being right in a single look was that there or um he was more dog-like

34:37.360 --> 34:41.680
he would occasionally fetch like this little styrofoam thing I had he would fetch it and

34:41.680 --> 34:46.720
bring it back and he was um friendly and you know if somebody came over you would jump in

34:46.720 --> 34:52.800
their lap um he was less standoffish than most cats um but there was just something

34:53.360 --> 35:00.320
about the way he would look at me I don't know and I maybe probably in his mind he's just a cat

35:00.880 --> 35:07.760
I give him food whereas in my mind it's some kind of you know great soul connection great

35:08.480 --> 35:14.560
long-running uh romance not in his kitty mind but either way so he died in March and I thought um

35:15.120 --> 35:24.000
so I sort of concocted this I just thought um you know that well if he died and he died on March

35:24.000 --> 35:29.840
10th and so I thought well maybe Leon was born that same day and that's why that's why I'm so

35:29.840 --> 35:36.800
drawn to him I don't know oh that that may okay that makes sense but then you just felt like

35:37.440 --> 35:42.320
when you saw him you just like there's something it was his picture yeah oh the picture and you

35:42.320 --> 35:48.720
were drawn something about the personality in the eyes it was something about his picture I don't

35:48.720 --> 35:56.240
know what it was and um and everybody at the time was like what are you thinking why would you get a

35:56.240 --> 36:02.400
dog you can't you know can't even take care of yourself you're overworked and busy and why would

36:02.400 --> 36:07.760
you get a five-month-old pit bull mix you know why not get an older dog that's easier to take

36:07.760 --> 36:14.240
care of and um for me it was like I don't I don't want any dog I don't want my intention

36:14.240 --> 36:20.080
isn't to get a dog but there's something about this dog that I have to get and so I went to see

36:20.080 --> 36:28.320
him um and then I had already filled out an application it was just I went to see him and

36:28.320 --> 36:34.960
then I it was the afternoon and I sort of decided in my head like all right I'm coming back to get

36:34.960 --> 36:40.320
him I have to and so the next morning I got on the subway and went back to get him um and I was

36:40.320 --> 36:45.600
crying on the subway and I remember thinking that people I don't like crying in public I cry a lot

36:45.600 --> 36:52.960
but I don't like crying in front of other people and um I love it I thought people on the train

36:52.960 --> 36:57.840
looking at me probably think that you know I just somebody died or sorry you you're crying on the

36:57.840 --> 37:02.480
way there on the way back on the way there to get him yeah I don't and I don't know why I was crying

37:02.480 --> 37:08.480
it was just something about it was overwhelming so so tears of happiness or tears of something

37:08.480 --> 37:18.160
something I yeah I think tears are overwhelming and I know I'm like jumping off but there was

37:18.160 --> 37:22.560
some I don't now I'm trying was it in your conversation or the book Carl Dysaroff talks

37:22.560 --> 37:27.200
about tears of joy and trying to explain them and he said something about how it was like

37:28.080 --> 37:35.200
about you know because tears of sadness could be understood in a having like a evolutionary

37:35.200 --> 37:42.400
purpose but why tears of joy and I think he said it was something about like hope that could be

37:44.160 --> 37:50.880
like lost so if you cried at a wedding it might be like you're crying because their love is

37:50.880 --> 37:56.240
beautiful and you're crying because you know they could get hit by a bus tomorrow or something you

37:56.240 --> 38:02.160
know like it had something to do with that and I thought um but I thought to me it feels like

38:02.160 --> 38:07.680
overwhelmed because then how would that explain music because music will make me cry a lot because

38:07.680 --> 38:15.600
it's it's anything beautiful like love you realize you're gonna have it's gonna be over one day

38:16.240 --> 38:20.400
so or it's just overwhelming it could be overwhelming I think it's just overwhelming

38:20.400 --> 38:26.240
but over it could like if you had to explain like one way to explain it as you're saying is

38:27.200 --> 38:32.080
it's so awesome that it breaks your heart that it's going to be over this feeling is going to be

38:32.080 --> 38:40.320
over the either it's the song or the person you're going to lose them one day or but even when you're

38:40.320 --> 38:44.880
just watching something that this is completely ridiculous but I remember one time I probably was

38:45.840 --> 38:53.440
hormonal or something but it was like an episode of Family Feud years ago and the fam oh no um

38:54.160 --> 38:57.840
Wheel of Fortune yeah it was Wheel of Fortune and some family like won all this money and they

38:57.840 --> 39:03.120
were so happy like it just they were so happy they must probably needed the money or something and

39:03.120 --> 39:08.400
I started crying and I'm thinking why am I crying but I think it's just I think it's just like an

39:08.400 --> 39:14.240
overwhelming I think it's overwhelming in some way and crying like crying because crying is a relief

39:14.240 --> 39:20.960
like you feel better after you cry but that's not doesn't explain the crying you feel better

39:20.960 --> 39:26.720
after you cry and you're saying it's overwhelming but that's on the surface the question is what's

39:26.720 --> 39:32.960
going on underneath that's the young shadow and I don't think neither you or I can answer that

39:32.960 --> 39:36.640
question right but there's something going on right there's probably something that

39:36.640 --> 39:43.040
touches you in some specific way yeah um and so you were crying on the subway so I was crying

39:43.040 --> 39:47.600
on the subway it's very it's very New York thing to do yeah I well that's one of the things I love

39:47.600 --> 39:53.760
about New York is people you can be weird and do strange things and nobody's gonna look at you

39:53.760 --> 40:00.240
strangely or the fascinating thing about New York is super crowded and yet you can still feel super

40:00.240 --> 40:09.600
alone but also energized because a lot of other things and places will make me feel depleted but

40:09.600 --> 40:15.120
there's something about the energy of New York specifically that feels energizing I mean everybody

40:15.120 --> 40:21.600
is going up about their day excited for a future they're building and so on and that that could be

40:21.600 --> 40:31.600
energy sure sure it could be overwhelming though it can be yeah I mean also depending on what

40:31.600 --> 40:37.280
neighborhood on what part well I'm just talking about the subway right yeah and then there's the

40:37.360 --> 40:42.640
musicians I love New York New York at its best is a special place I've never lived but every time I

40:42.640 --> 40:48.880
visit it's so many characters so many fascinating people yeah and and then there's a bunch of people

40:48.880 --> 40:52.880
always crying on the subway and you're one of those people I was one of those people one day

40:53.440 --> 41:00.240
yeah so you I befriended some busking musicians like the the guys that just play out on the street

41:00.240 --> 41:03.760
are these two young guys playing guitar and I felt like it was one of those moments where

41:03.760 --> 41:07.520
it was like candid camera because nobody was paying attention and I thought it was like

41:08.480 --> 41:13.440
I was so beautiful I may have cried or almost cried or but anyway I ended up becoming friends

41:13.440 --> 41:19.440
with them and helping them out in some ways and and I knew I was like well they're gonna

41:19.440 --> 41:27.760
do really well yeah and now they're like playing large places and it's kind of fun to watch via

41:27.760 --> 41:34.320
Instagram you know they're going on tour in Europe and they were these two scrappy guys

41:34.320 --> 41:40.080
well now it's just one of the guys and but they had like no money nowhere to live nothing

41:40.800 --> 41:48.240
and um another and they didn't quit on tour no persisted that's cool yeah exactly so um

41:48.240 --> 41:54.320
but I cried on the subway and I got there and he was there and I adopted him but it just felt

41:54.960 --> 42:04.080
very profoundly um like a force that was beyond me like I couldn't not get him so he was the same

42:04.080 --> 42:12.000
in person as he was in the picture like meaning in terms of like something like pulling you

42:12.000 --> 42:17.200
towards him like something yeah when I first met him the day before he was really distracted

42:17.200 --> 42:23.200
which I think is um you know he is a puppy that spends most of his day in a cage which is not

42:23.200 --> 42:28.880
natural so when I think let him they let me take him for a walk and he was kind of you know

42:28.880 --> 42:34.400
distracted and all of the place but then when we put him back in the cage he sort of laid down

42:34.400 --> 42:40.080
and looked at me and I looked back at him and of course I imagined all kinds of I just looked at

42:40.080 --> 42:45.760
him and I thought all right I'm don't worry I'm coming back to get you like I'll I'll get you so

42:46.720 --> 42:56.000
um yeah it just it felt like um it felt like something that I had no choice that I had to do

42:56.000 --> 43:03.360
and that was the beginning of a 12-year journey together an ongoing an ongoing one but so I wrote

43:03.360 --> 43:08.880
about these things on my website and um and I think it was you know among the many things that

43:09.840 --> 43:19.280
was later weaponized by um Anthony Stranges just oh the fact because I was so open about it

43:19.280 --> 43:24.640
yeah and also just it's not like I believe that he was you know that I was just expressing my

43:24.640 --> 43:30.080
feelings about how I felt going to get him that there was something about Leon and specifically

43:30.080 --> 43:36.640
that I it was like I felt like I had to get him so um is there words you can put to your connection

43:36.640 --> 43:46.320
with Leon like is it love is it friendship is it some kind of like what is it

43:49.120 --> 43:54.400
or or are we getting to the crying and being overwhelmed something you just can't put words

43:54.400 --> 44:00.080
to yeah it's probably something that's hard to put words to kind of like I sort of feel like

44:00.080 --> 44:10.240
love being something that's hard to define is part of is the definition of love the fact that

44:10.240 --> 44:14.320
you can't define it you know that the moment you define it you're no longer talking about love

44:14.960 --> 44:21.120
sort of something like that um so well the my definition of love is whatever's going on in true

44:21.120 --> 44:29.040
romance I don't know let me fly through the timeline before we get to any of the interesting

44:29.040 --> 44:41.680
details so in uh 2011 you meet Anthony Strangis then in 2012 you two get married uh 2015 the staff

44:41.680 --> 44:49.360
walk out due to failure to pay from the two restaurants it reopens in April of 2015 and July

44:50.320 --> 44:56.080
of that year there's another walkout and so on there's all this kind of stuff using timeline

44:56.720 --> 45:05.600
well it's not to me that's not even the point is in 2015 there's chaos happening okay uh 2016

45:05.600 --> 45:14.960
in the spring pure foods and wine closes closed in um 2015 2015 okay there's some factual stuff

45:14.960 --> 45:19.920
that's not yeah maybe correct me on it to me it's not that important to me the spirit of the thing

45:19.920 --> 45:29.280
is important okay May 12 2016 you and your then husband Anthony Strangis were arrested after he

45:29.280 --> 45:37.360
ordered pizza using his real name okay in May 2017 you pleaded guilty to stealing more than two

45:37.360 --> 45:44.560
million dollars from investors and scheming to defraud as well as this is from Wikipedia

45:44.560 --> 45:49.040
yeah they're wrong well let me just finish reading it and then you tell me why it's wrong

45:49.040 --> 45:54.400
in May 2017 you pleaded guilty to stealing more than two million dollars from investors and

45:54.400 --> 46:00.560
scheming to defraud as well as criminal tax fraud charges why is Wikipedia wrong and how dare you

46:01.760 --> 46:09.040
well I mean I did plead guilty to those things which um I had to oh I was I got a jury duty

46:09.040 --> 46:14.880
summons and I had to fill out like what charges I pled guilty to um and I had to go online and look

46:14.880 --> 46:20.560
it up because I didn't really remember which is I thought that was interesting I had to go look

46:20.560 --> 46:27.600
it up but actually let me finish the time because there's one more point oh yeah March 16 2022 bad

46:27.600 --> 46:36.240
vegan documentary comes out where you're interviewed does they tell the story some stuff is true

46:36.240 --> 46:41.520
sometimes some is not some is disturbingly misleading as you said okay timeline over anyway

46:41.840 --> 46:49.440
what's wrong with the um how would you elaborate onto the you pleading guilty for two million

46:49.440 --> 46:54.800
dollars stealing so a lot of people plead guilty when they're for reasons other than

46:55.840 --> 47:02.960
they're actually guilty so you know it's even right now if I knew that I was going to have to

47:02.960 --> 47:10.000
spend four months or three and a half um at Rikers and I was thinking about this recently

47:10.000 --> 47:16.480
and even if I knew that I'd be acquitted at the end of a trial I very

47:18.880 --> 47:25.920
likely would have just taken the four months because um you know the stress of going through

47:25.920 --> 47:32.080
a trial but in particular be incredibly stressful not knowing the outcome um and then money and

47:32.080 --> 47:37.360
expense I didn't have and so you know people plead guilty all the time even if they don't think that

47:37.920 --> 47:44.400
that they should um and my situation was so complicated and hard to understand

47:45.280 --> 47:51.280
that it just was the easier thing to do but also I just was kind of going on the advice of lawyers

47:51.280 --> 47:59.280
and um so the the choice just so I understand was to plead guilty or to go through a lengthy trial

48:00.240 --> 48:07.360
and that trial would stretch a long time and it would be extremely stressful and extremely

48:07.360 --> 48:14.480
expensive because you have to pay the lawyers right and I didn't have anything right and so

48:14.480 --> 48:20.000
a lot of people in that situation might choose to plead guilty and so that doesn't necessarily mean

48:21.440 --> 48:27.200
the full heaviness of that statement of guilt right and I think people plead guilty all the

48:27.760 --> 48:35.040
time in situations where they're being threatened with uh like a heavy sentence um and they sort

48:35.040 --> 48:40.000
of feel like they have no choice but that's kind of part of a lot of things that are messed up

48:40.000 --> 48:45.600
about the system overall that didn't necessarily apply in my case but so we'll talk about to what

48:45.600 --> 48:54.960
degree you're guilty and what that even means yeah yeah it because it depends on intention I think

48:57.360 --> 49:03.520
yeah yeah but then the word intention also means a lot of things like the word love

49:04.240 --> 49:14.000
that's true um all right so the restaurant closed the first time um when I was away and told to be

49:15.280 --> 49:24.400
off communication um and then I by Anthony yes and then um he told you not to talk to anybody he

49:24.400 --> 49:32.400
told me not to like open email or look at my phone or whatever um and so when I came back

49:33.200 --> 49:40.560
and had to get it reopened which seemed like an unbelievably difficult task and I was kind of

49:40.560 --> 49:46.800
shocked that I was able to pull it off um you know I worked incredibly hard to get it reopened

49:47.360 --> 49:54.560
and you know because that placement meant everything to me and so I just like I just

49:54.560 --> 49:59.760
had to get it reopened were you surrounded by people that were just angry at you at that time

49:59.760 --> 50:06.400
not well just the staff and all that yeah but most of them came back a lot of them came back

50:06.400 --> 50:13.920
I think what was so unbelievably painful about that whole time um was like not being able to

50:13.920 --> 50:18.160
tell anybody what was really going on and in a sense not really knowing what was going on myself

50:18.160 --> 50:25.040
but not being able to like having to pretend all the time was just like so you didn't really tell

50:25.040 --> 50:30.320
anybody about uh Anthony about him and what was really going on in part because I didn't really

50:30.320 --> 50:34.960
understand what was going on so what I did was I raised money to reopen the restaurant

50:34.960 --> 50:45.040
and I think I raised something like eight maybe like 900 grand um and probably 90% of that went

50:45.040 --> 50:52.880
to reopen the restaurant um and I even made two um sales tax payments right before we disappeared

50:53.680 --> 51:00.320
so it just sort of logically seemed like so I didn't it's not like all of this money was taken

51:00.320 --> 51:06.240
and then he and I ran off together with a whole bunch of money it was like I raised a bunch of

51:06.240 --> 51:12.800
money to reopen the restaurant you know because I wanted the restaurant to exist again and I wanted

51:12.800 --> 51:18.640
to you know I wanted to run it I wanted to reopen the restaurant and um most of that money went to

51:18.640 --> 51:29.520
reopen the restaurant and then I disappeared so um sort of the the timeline gets a bit wonky

51:29.600 --> 51:35.040
so it's you know this impression was created that we ran off with a whole bunch of money and we

51:35.040 --> 51:41.520
didn't so you know if I wanted to be a criminal and steal a bunch of money why would I have

51:41.520 --> 51:47.680
put it all back into the restaurant and reopened it and then also made two ten thousand dollar

51:47.680 --> 51:54.480
sales tax payments that I didn't you know and I also repaid um you know ten thousand dollars of

51:54.480 --> 51:58.880
another loan I'm you know I was making repayments and stuff and then boom I disappear

51:58.880 --> 52:05.920
so is your mind going through a roller coaster here so could there have been multiple use there

52:05.920 --> 52:11.200
so one one mind is like I love this restaurant I'm going to reopen it I'm this

52:12.800 --> 52:19.360
chef business owner this person and then the other the other is a human that's in this

52:20.560 --> 52:28.720
complicated love affair it was no love affair okay these are just words how can I okay what

52:29.280 --> 52:38.960
I don't want to uh I say that lightly but also not because love can make us do dark things

52:38.960 --> 52:47.280
and you can say that's not love but okay the thing that traps us the things that pulls us

52:47.280 --> 52:53.120
in to a connection with another human being that's love even when it's abusive and dark

52:53.120 --> 52:58.560
and toxic and all those kinds of things in some cases I think like if it's voluntary but in other

52:58.560 --> 53:06.400
cases um somebody pulls you in so it's not like you're drawn towards them they they pull you in

53:06.400 --> 53:12.640
so just to clarify even when it's not physical when it's when the pull is with words so it's

53:12.640 --> 53:22.880
emotional yeah okay where is your mind when you raise eight to nine hundred thousand dollars to

53:22.960 --> 53:30.960
open the restaurant working your ass off to open this thing okay making payments and then all of

53:30.960 --> 53:38.160
a sudden disappearing what where was your mind um if you had a lengthy conversation with Carl

53:38.160 --> 53:45.120
Dysaroth in privacy what would you be telling him as your therapist I would probably be asking him

53:45.120 --> 53:50.160
questions okay no forget the car was part of this well and actually I have more questions for

53:50.160 --> 53:55.600
Andrew Heberman because you know I I've had to investigate all of these things myself like

53:55.600 --> 54:05.360
dissociation um and even there's a psychologist who believes that he must have used neuro-linguistic

54:05.360 --> 54:11.200
programming on me which is something that Keith Ranieri from the NXIVM cult he was known to have

54:11.200 --> 54:16.400
used that with people um and I think neuro-linguistic programming is kind of the same as

54:17.280 --> 54:25.600
like a sort of like hypnotism the only reason I know about what NLP is is because in what I do

54:25.600 --> 54:30.000
there's something called natural language processing artificial intelligence stuff so it has the same

54:30.880 --> 54:37.840
like three letters right uh what's the other thing that NLP neuro-linguistic programming

54:37.840 --> 54:44.720
yeah anyway all right well uh we we talked about Andrew my friend Andrew Heberman offline and you

54:44.720 --> 54:49.760
definitely you should do a podcast with him he's a he's a fascinating he's such a brilliant and kind

54:49.760 --> 54:55.440
human being definitely worth talking to yeah I've listened to a lot of a lot of his and you said

54:55.440 --> 55:01.920
that you listened to a lot of his instructions on getting light in the morning or whatever during

55:01.920 --> 55:07.760
the day it's very important for your um mental like there's all these kinds of studies it's good

55:07.760 --> 55:12.320
for your for your mind for your oh and also the other thing that he got me to do is to try to

55:12.320 --> 55:17.040
delay having coffee so instead of having coffee right when you wake up I always drink a lot of

55:17.040 --> 55:22.480
water first yeah but then um instead of having coffee right away if you wait an hour or an hour

55:22.480 --> 55:29.760
and a half or two hours then your body is able to naturally do something that drinking coffee too

55:29.760 --> 55:35.440
soon would sort of blunt that so then you'll be more tired in the afternoon so if you wait an hour

55:35.440 --> 55:40.400
and a half or two hours or as long you know before you have your first cup of coffee then you won't

55:40.400 --> 55:46.640
be as tired in the afternoon interesting um there's a lot of does it work yes one coffee

55:46.640 --> 55:52.560
addict talking to another coffee addict yes it works and so I try to get up and do other things

55:52.560 --> 56:03.040
first um before I have coffee um so and the light thing also makes a lot of sense to me um getting

56:03.040 --> 56:10.000
light early in the morning I have a one of those bright light boxes um and I would love to have an

56:10.000 --> 56:13.840
apartment that had a little deck or something where I could just step outside because when you

56:13.840 --> 56:17.600
live in an apartment you kind of have to like go all the way outside and then there's people

56:17.600 --> 56:22.560
everywhere and so to to get that early morning light isn't that hard to do when you're are people

56:22.560 --> 56:26.480
good for you or bad for you what does Andrew Huberman say about that I'm just kidding it's a

56:26.480 --> 56:33.120
joke okay so moving back to where was your mind that led you to disappear to what you guys go to

56:33.120 --> 56:39.280
Vegas first and then Tennessee no I kind of refer to it as like the road trip from hell it's a very

56:39.280 --> 56:44.960
hunterous thompson way to describe it right you went back to backcountry maybe it was sort of

56:44.960 --> 56:52.640
hunterous thompsonesque except without actual drugs um that was one of the first questions my

56:52.640 --> 56:58.000
father asked me was was it drugs and I wished that I could have said yes yeah because I didn't know

56:58.000 --> 57:07.040
how to explain what had happened um but so he took me away involuntarily except you know of course

57:07.120 --> 57:12.960
he wasn't holding a gun to my head but all along it was like a metaphorical gun

57:13.520 --> 57:26.320
was there ever physical abuse um no what would qualify as sexual abuse yes um but physically no

57:27.280 --> 57:31.840
a couple of times we would get into a slightly physical fights but he never um

57:31.840 --> 57:42.960
um I mean he was big and as large and blubbery as he was he was he was also really strong

57:42.960 --> 57:48.240
so sometimes he would like subdue me but other than that no there wasn't physical violence but

57:48.240 --> 57:57.360
a lot of people will say that um the psychological violence is um I don't want to diminish physical

57:57.360 --> 58:03.200
violence but some people say that the psychological and emotional violence is more destructive it's

58:03.200 --> 58:08.320
just that the physical violence is easier to identify it's easier to identify and and it

58:08.320 --> 58:12.800
seems kind of more straightforward yeah whereas psychological you know and you have a bruise on

58:12.800 --> 58:19.520
your face or you break a bone and those things hopefully heal in a visible way but psychological

58:19.520 --> 58:27.680
stuff you know you can't easily identify or understand or others can't easily identify it

58:27.680 --> 58:33.680
and then you find yourself crying for no reason at a beautiful song at some point yes and it's

58:33.680 --> 58:40.240
that that has to do something happening in the depth of your mind okay so he took you away

58:41.440 --> 58:47.280
but where was I mean where was your mind that was doing both of those things was able to be taken

58:47.280 --> 58:54.480
away but also was pushing to this the the the flourishing the reopening and the flourishing

58:54.480 --> 58:59.520
of the restaurant well you know I wouldn't have reopened the restaurant with and then knowing I

58:59.520 --> 59:03.520
was going to all of a sudden be taken away from it and it was going to get closed again you know

59:03.520 --> 59:09.360
it's like why why would I do that why would anybody do that um and one of the things that

59:09.360 --> 59:14.480
I tried to do towards the end was I was trying to get myself off the bank accounts because I

59:14.480 --> 59:20.320
didn't want him to be able to get money out of me and so there was one time when I tried to get

59:20.320 --> 59:26.240
one of the investors we went to the bank together to put her on as the signer and take me off and

59:26.240 --> 59:29.760
because we didn't have the operating agreement they wouldn't let us do it so it was like this

59:29.760 --> 59:39.040
little snafu and um so all of these things are sort of the opposite of criminal intent but that's a

59:39.360 --> 59:46.160
legal thing what's what's going on in your mind at this time I don't know I mean were you always

59:46.160 --> 59:53.920
did you give yourself a chance to just think no and I think that's part of one of the things that

59:54.640 --> 01:00:01.440
might have saved me or anybody that's pulled into a cult one of the things that they do is they keep

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:10.000
you exhausted overwhelmed confused and afraid um and so you don't have any time to think

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.160
so you're just kind of constantly running and you're confused and then things are happening

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.400
that's funny there's I have some quotes in my book draft because I listen to a lot of podcasts I

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:24.080
don't know what the logistics are of like crediting a quote from a podcast in a book

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:32.960
but I have a couple I think it was um Andrew Huberman on Joe Rogan said something about um

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.960
if a animal if a human or animal I don't know how he would know the human or animal is stressed um

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:49.200
and I'm paraphrasing this horribly but they're they're much more easily prone to um be

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:57.120
not prone to but forced into delusional thinking um and so that quote resonated for me because

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.320
you know he kept me in this incredibly stressed out afraid confused state and then whatever he's

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.600
sort of planting in my mind I'm going to be that much more likely to just kind of go along with it

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:13.120
well we'll see how this whole journey ends let's actually just step back a little bit and just

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:18.240
looking at the employees at the restaurant and so on do you have remorse for what happened

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.600
especially from the perspective of the employees and the staff yeah I mean hurting them was sort

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:31.920
of the last thing that I would ever have wanted to do and in part I mean there was financial harm um

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:39.200
but I don't I don't know whether it's more important or not but you know it was

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:46.720
taking a place that was very much like a family to them um and it was as if I destroyed it

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.120
and so I think that because we were so much like a family it was almost as if

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.920
like mom went off the deep end and got together with some

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.000
cuckoo abusive guy and and sort of abandoned them and they didn't know what was going on and

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.920
what was happening and so do you regret lying to them I regret lying to anybody

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:16.320
in all those circumstances but I wasn't lying

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:25.200
you know he made me think that you know everything was going to be reversed and okay and anybody that

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.560
money was borrowed from they would get it back you know maybe tenfold and so it was this weird

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:38.400
situation of having like one foot in his reality and potentially believing the things he was saying

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:44.400
or even over time wanting to believe them more and more because the alternative was so

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:53.200
um the alternative was worse the alternative was like was increasingly a bigger and bigger

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.440
nightmare so so there's this whole situation where you're constantly giving them money you're

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:04.400
constantly borrowing borrowing money well this idea that it'll be repaid like a hundred x-fold

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.760
right kind of like yeah so sort of like lying to somebody because you're planning their surprise

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.120
party you think like well I'm lying to somebody but I'm but it's because there's a good reason

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.680
yeah you know it's sort of that's not a good example but no but you could have

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.960
not made it a surprise party and be like pull them in onto the planning of the party

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:32.960
and be honest about like everything that's happening not in a negative way but like

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:39.760
get them in on the fact that okay I just need to give money to this guy but we'll get

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:48.080
he is a super rich person of some kind and he'll um repay I mean I wish I well

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.240
because you're holding on to this time I mean that's part of the torture is that you're isolated

01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:01.360
and unable unable to tell anybody but you're not unable or he was telling you you're not

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.040
allowed to say anything to anybody I mean you're choosing not to say anything

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.360
but it's because of the sort of the weight of it because it's embarrassing to sort of

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:19.040
is it embarrassing it's something I mean what why do you not tell others you know what is that

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:24.640
what's what what's happening to the mind where you don't tell others I don't know you're part

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:30.000
of why the story is you know everything that happened is hard to summarize and talk about

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:40.720
in any concise way is that so much of it happens in this very slow slow slow way and um you know

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.560
people always use the whole like frog and boiling water example um so that by the time you realize

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:54.160
you're fucked it's too late um and it and it seems hard to believe or understand other people

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:59.360
because they see where you are or where you ended up and they think well how did you let that happen

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:05.200
well I don't know I yeah I would I have willingly destroyed my life and hurt all the people I care

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:11.200
about and you know allowed my mother to get hurt and I wouldn't have ever ever willingly done that

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:17.200
so something else must have happened and that's um that's the part that's difficult to understand

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:24.240
let me ask you about another hard question yeah do you deserve most or all of the blame for the

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:31.920
failure of the business or are others at fault too well the business didn't fail it was doing

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:41.120
well and so it's closing closing is like it was destroyed and who deserves the blame for that

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.400
I'm asking from your perspective when you think about it in in the privacy in your mind

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:55.760
and are you angry at Anthony are you angry yourself both I think that um

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:06.880
in the privacy of my own mind and to everybody listening um it's it's I feel responsible I feel

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:12.320
responsible in the same way that if you kind of did something if you were driving you did something

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:18.320
stupid and caused an accident in which other people died you would feel I think horrifically

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:24.160
responsible and you'd blame yourself because maybe you looked away or checked your phone or

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:32.400
something um but you didn't intend to kill those people of course so for me it's like

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:39.920
I didn't intend to kill you know sometimes I say like my own child I don't know if that's offensive

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:45.200
to some people but it's like as if I killed my own child it was it was it was a business but it

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:58.400
was special um so I don't feel guilt I feel responsibility and then um you know I'm angry

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:06.480
at at him even though that anger is pointless okay because this has come up let's continue

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:13.520
uh with the hard questions are they gonna get easier they're gonna get it okay most of them

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:18.880
are easy um this is this is fun we're having fun you posted on instagram

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:27.520
the ending no I'm gonna cite instagram like it's Shakespeare okay the ending is disturbingly

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.720
misleading but still I'm very grateful for this coverage let's talk about the documentary

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:38.960
in quotes documentary I'm okay with the criticism and judgment but would rather

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:44.480
be based on what's true and then you say a couple more sentences and then you say

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:51.840
Leon who has his own instagram account yes one lucky rescue dog says hello he loves you all

01:07:51.840 --> 01:08:00.240
even if you call me a quote defective arrogant sociopath it's all okay so the hard question

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:08.080
do you think you are in part a sociopath no would you know it if you were yes how does

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.920
this work so what had you learned from reading this book I had all these interesting thoughts

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.960
about all these sort of questions and thoughts about it because um the book I'm reading now

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:21.360
that I'm only about a third of the way through she talks about um some of the things in the

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:27.600
brain structure that are particular to sociopaths and so then it makes you think well what if that

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:35.120
could be tweaked in some way like could you unsociopath a sociopath is it nature or nurture

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:41.120
like I suppose is the question I think it's both um I think it's genetic and then it's like genes

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:49.040
that are turned on it um by things like a particularly violent childhood or some sort

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.520
of a dysfunction so I think somebody could have the gene it's not turned on and then um the

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:04.160
sociopaths have the gene and it's turned on so so sociopath means that you're not able to be

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.200
empathetic or you're generally not empathetic to the to the suffering of others or to the

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:17.040
emotions of other I mean it's a hollowness so it's like you don't have um just completely lacking

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:23.760
the capacity I mean it's tragic because they wouldn't understand or feel love but it's like

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:31.920
a hollowness um and and then something also about the wiring and I think also because of that

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:41.440
hollowness they're able to incredibly quickly look at others and identify their insecurities

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:48.880
and buttons and weak spots so they're incredibly good at manipulation is that because they're just

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.960
able to objectively observe the situation I wonder probably in part but there was some other

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.920
explanation related to the brain structure that I read somewhere that made sense to me and I won't

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:04.720
like remember it because I don't usually you're not Andrew Huberman who seems to reference like

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:10.400
I'll listen to him perfectly yeah every single line from every book or paper he's ever read yes

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.640
right I don't remember things in that way I try to usually remember the conclusions

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:20.240
right so like I might remember that he he might give a whole long explanation about why

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.040
it's good to do this or to take this supplement that's a bad habit I have sometimes I'll order

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:29.680
supplements and then by the time they arrive I've forgotten why I forgot why I just take them all

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.520
but the healthy version I hope we get to talk about food because I feel like yes you have a

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:42.320
brain that should be fed only the best food oh wow so we can talk about that later I have

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.760
a lot of philosophies about that but certainly fluff is not what in the best what is best we'll

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:55.840
definitely talk about food throughout what is best that makes me think of Conan

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.760
and I just talked to Oliver Stone who I didn't realize wrote Conan the Barbarian

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.480
do you know that in my head I pictured Conan O'Brien that's what

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:12.640
he's also one of the funniest wait why is I love him but I when you said that I was like

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:19.280
why did that make you think of Conan O'Brien yeah yeah I love him so much such a brilliant human

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:29.520
yeah sociopathy sociopathy yeah so it's stuff about the brain fine but how do you know you're

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.960
not a sociopath would you know it how am I a sociopath how would I know it how do you know

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.880
well having listened to a lot well wouldn't I be able to be good at faking it isn't that what

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.240
well there's a mask on the cover of this book I don't think you would be doing the work I don't

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:51.120
wear lipstick you'd probably be running for office or you know a trader on wall street or

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:59.280
one of the things about sociopaths is they um they kind of need like this stimulation of risk and

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:10.240
danger um well I need okay sure more than average I like okay but wall street

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:17.120
there's a fakeness like I don't like the fakeness of what the game of it yeah that's why I left

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:25.680
I didn't I just it was a strange environment okay so you're not you're not a quote defective

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.320
arrogant sociopath what does defective even mean I know well I think that somebody had just called

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:37.120
me that and I think that you know it's easy for people to say like don't read the comments but

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.160
it's hard not to because then also you'd miss the beautiful ones um or sometimes like you have to

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:48.880
go on there to to check a private message and you just stuff it's there people saying terrible

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:57.120
things so um I try to people say you know don't pay attention to the comments it's hard not to

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:06.320
but I try to even with the documentary you try to still kind of see to look to look for the

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:11.280
for the good ones for the kind ones for the supportive there were overwhelming kind comments

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:20.640
and so that that helped and felt a lot better but sometimes um sometimes the the negative comments

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.040
are based on you know they're based on false information so if somebody understood if somebody

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:30.400
knew everything that happened and then wanted to judge me or say things like that's somehow

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:38.400
at least that's all right but um so you think people saying these things based on um things

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:46.640
that are totally false is just yeah it's hard it's it's hard to just let that go um

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:56.160
but I know that people also say things you know for their own personal reasons I had a fascinating

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:03.920
exchange with somebody who direct messaged me and called me trash um you responded I responded

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.080
because it was I know it was amazing so okay I would do this while it's sort of like a

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:17.040
I might be procrastinating or but I would scroll through because the private messages were

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.400
overwhelming and there's still just this massive backlog that I'll never probably get to read but

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.240
the one that called you trash as a pickup as an opener you were like this is interesting I just

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:35.840
was in a mood yeah and so I responded and I wish I hadn't deleted it because I I sort of deleted

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.680
a bunch and then I was like oh why did I delete that one because I was curious what exactly I

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:46.240
said to him but I responded to him um in a nice way and then he responded back and then it started

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:53.200
this whole back and forth conversation um so he was kind quickly or no yes and then also like

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.440
wanted to get to know me and lives in Pennsylvania and was like I'll come to you and I'm like

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.680
do you realize if we you know if somehow this just turned into like that would be our how

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:09.520
did you meet story well he called me trash online that's a pretty good yeah he ended up having such

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.840
an insightful comment I just found it interesting and I think he at first he said I never imagined

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.760
you'd reply which is you know it's like part of the whole thing with social media although this

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:25.920
guy wasn't anonymous um was not anonymous no he had a I think he had a private account but it's

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.400
like his name and his face was there and people forget that you're a human being when they message

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:37.360
you exactly folks when you message me I'm a human being so I told him that that was you know like

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:43.040
that I was hurtful yeah and um and I guess I wanted to understand more why he said it and

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.400
it was surprisingly insightful but he said something about again I wish I hadn't deleted

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:58.160
it that he um he was like I guess I was just angry because um like that guy

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.680
he said something like I guess I was just angry because that guy got you and

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.080
wow I would have you know so it made me think of the whole like sort of

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:17.840
incel jealousy thing that can be very terrifying if you're female is that like if you reject a guy

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:26.800
they might turn around and be violent or angry at you and um so his well to be fair there's a

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:32.720
dormant anger in probably all of us I believe there's a capacity for cruelty and anger and

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:39.280
destruction all of us and the whole struggle of life is to uh emphasize the good stuff

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:46.880
yeah yeah so it's not just an incel thing it's true for men and women both yeah capable of

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:52.800
cruelty that's that is very true but this one guy so let me put on my therapist hat

01:16:52.800 --> 01:17:00.800
because we started what do we start with um I already forgot but the the oh leon back to

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:09.360
sociopath no no just um you know maybe it's not the best idea to answer the comments that start

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.320
with your trash I don't do it all the time it just I happened upon that one and I was just in a

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.000
certain mood I was just in a certain mood well let's let's and I like further offline sort of

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.840
yeah um discuss this mood that you're in because it might get you in trouble at some point in your

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:36.240
future okay uh um can we just jump back speaking of um guys that say as an opener to your trash

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:43.280
how did you and anthony strangers meet can we jump around and tell some of the details here

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:48.000
because that I believe the documentary doesn't cover that that well it's not clear there's some

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:55.920
twitter interactions and you've kind of assumed um by the way I do think you need some social

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:04.160
media coaching on this because I think you know um I you know I have I have some uh uh books you

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.840
need to read I think uh some manuals on how to use twitter properly but anyway the the apparently

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:15.280
you kind of thought that this person uh who turned out to be what was his name Shane he

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:20.880
called himself Shane Fox but he turned out to be anthony strangers that he was somehow friends with

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.880
Al Baldwin because of their friendly interaction on twitter and so you started interacting with him

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:36.880
and then there was how did that escalate quickly to um it escalated slowly and I think um I'm sure

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.720
it was intentional because had I met him right away I would have probably thought like oh he's

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:51.280
not what I thought he was and no thanks um but it was a long time it was many weeks of back and

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:58.960
forth conversation um digitally one way or another so it was you know via twitter and then via direct

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:04.160
message and then we both played words with friends back then and we would message in words with

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:10.080
friends and then eventually you know we exchanged phone numbers how does word with friends work

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:16.320
what's that I know that's a popular game is that scrabble it's like scrabble and you're playing

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.920
other people and then there's like a chat function yeah and then you can chat with them right so you

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:27.600
were this intellectually stimulating game and you were what like flirting and that kind of stuff

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:35.520
like witty banter yes aka flirting yes and but but um

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:41.840
all of that lasted a really long time and and he would give me like little

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:46.400
tiny bits and pieces of information about himself that made him seem kind of mysterious

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:55.360
um a dark mysterious man who was a navy seal strong yeah and he would always imply things

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:00.080
versus say them outright so you're kind of always guessing and filling things in Clint Eastwood type

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.640
of character he's not gonna say it outright he's what he's a Clint Eastwood type of character he's

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:10.800
not gonna say it outright right he's just gonna act badass yeah okay all right um and plus

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.920
intellectual because of word words with words with friends is that still a thing by the way so

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:21.680
wasn't with friends I think it still exists yeah but I I um I feel like if I started playing it

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:26.640
again I would I would get a little addicted and yeah um but stick to the coffee one of the

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:32.000
interesting things is that I used to think that he like used an app to look up things

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:38.160
but then he would do it in front of me he could like look at he was really good at it

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:44.800
and he could look at the the board and just like come up with you know a hundred point word that

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:50.640
I'd never even heard of so I think he had a little bit of that something going on in his brain that

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:56.560
was like um I don't know a little rain mannish or something in the way that he was able to

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:03.680
recall I think his recall is incredibly it's important if you if you lie a lot if you lie a

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:11.520
lot yeah to have good recall okay so uh when uh it's okay so how did it escalate slowly from

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:18.800
words with friends to meeting in real life like what you know what I mean what okay I know I know

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:30.240
it's not a love affair that said um when did you kind of get hooked by the oh I wonder you know

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:37.520
like fall in love just a slow yeah when did you fall in love it was a slow process

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:43.040
and I think um he found me at a time when there was sort of a perfect storm of the right conditions

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:50.240
for me to to fall into um whatever I fell into with him um because that was

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:55.600
heartbroken for the first time in my life where was the heartbreak coming from I had split with

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:03.520
my boyfriend of four years um and that broke your heart yeah I mean it was I knew it was a

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:09.360
relationship that I knew would end even when I got into it in the first place um because he

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:15.920
he's 15 years younger than me and surely that can't be the only character the only reason it

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:24.240
wouldn't work I need to also give you a book on love what's it called I'm I'm gonna write it I

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:30.160
don't know okay because there's another book that I didn't bring okay there's no book on twitter

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.160
and there's no book that love that's a lot of people keep trying to write love that I really

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.560
like that I think you might like but um what is it like like love languages I still have to read

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:45.360
that no it's called on love all right I can't wait but I'm gonna read the cliff notes bye it's

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:53.920
short by this guy named Alain de Botton French name I don't trust them already no it's funny

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.200
and it's beautiful and shocking that he wrote it when he was very young um and I first heard

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:04.960
him on a Krista Tippett podcast um that's how I end up reading a lot of books is like you

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:13.200
hear somebody on a podcast um so so you're hard broken you knew it wasn't gonna work I knew it

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.480
was gonna work because the age difference that's just because the age difference also you know I

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:24.800
just knew that eventually he'd want to move on and probably he'd find somebody younger and or

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:32.160
was young enough that he still needed to go have a bunch of other experiences and um you know

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:41.040
probably wanted a family or whatnot eventually so he was 21 and I was 34 when we first met um

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:45.840
but and but then we ended up living together for four years and it was the most

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:53.760
drama-free like there was no drama and I had just come off my prior relationship was Matthew Kenney

01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:03.600
which was very um dark in many ways and full of all kinds of yeah and I just couldn't couldn't

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:11.760
handle that so can ask you a personal question yes between us and between us friends um is there

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:22.720
part of you that's attracted to the drama and the chaos now looking back I feel like that happens

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:32.960
a lot and maybe there was at some point but I don't think so because you know part what made

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:43.280
that relationship work um with his name was Tobin was that there was no drama not at all and I don't

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.400
think I could have handled it and I feel that way now too like I just couldn't I can't like fighting

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:54.400
or any kind of like the people being passive aggressive I can't I can't handle that um

01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:03.840
so you've had enough storms now you want to calm yes yeah um so you knew it knew it wasn't work

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:10.240
I knew it wasn't gonna be forever well that that could be just uh insecurity and cynicism but fair

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:17.360
enough and then the heart was broken yes and now the heart was broken and fragile

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:27.200
and um there to be manipulated in some sense yes and there's another person that I heard

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:31.760
that I quoted my book saying that when you're heartbroken you can't rely on your instincts

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:39.520
somehow your instincts are compromised when you're heartbroken um and maybe I'm just like looking

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:48.400
for excuses as to why this happened but but I was heartbroken and then um I like to see people

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:54.720
when they're heartbroken because it's like um shows how much they really loved somebody

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:02.880
you know yeah it's it's sad but like sometimes love doesn't reveal itself as richly

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:10.080
when you're in it versus when you lose it right that's probably true anyway so your judgment

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:18.000
wasn't good great so now you're so you're lonely and you're super busy running the restaurant but

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:26.320
when you get home you're lonely or like in between yeah and I was kind of overwhelmed and um I'm sure

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.600
you were getting a lot of really positive attention from other guys too while New York

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:38.720
New York or yeah or too busy well no because of because it was a restaurant there was

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:44.000
constantly you're like constantly meeting people um and really interesting people and

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:53.840
New York is full of a lot of um interesting people and you're you know attractive so you

01:26:53.840 --> 01:27:00.160
why are you connected to some uh mysterious distant man from somewhere else playing over

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.920
words was because well I think now looking back I think it's because I felt like he understood me

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:13.280
and um you know what was that feeling for coming from you think like what why did you why does

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:19.840
one feel that you're understood one thing that made me extra easy to target is that I had written

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:25.520
a lot of very personal blogs and things so in addition to him asking me questions and me

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.680
probably just being insanely open and answering whatever he asked me I had also written and

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:37.680
posted a bunch of personal blogs some of them I've reposted on my new website and then some

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:46.800
of them I haven't but in one of them I go into detail about my frustrations um professionally

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:54.160
in growing the business and having read that and being a very smart person he he would have known

01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:04.000
kind of precisely what to say to get me um to get me drawn in so I think by waiting so long before

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:10.800
we met in person he'd already he'd already gotten me hooked in a way that was going to then make it

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:16.000
possible for me to you know see him and even though he doesn't look like I thought he did

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:23.360
I'll make excuses for it or um I mean that's a dangerous thing about um when people and I'm

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.800
not saying I fell in love with him in this way that I feel like there's another explanation for

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:35.680
the what felt like love um but when people fall in love quickly there's that danger that um

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.600
because that's what happens first that the more you learn about them you'll sort of rationalize

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.680
away things that might be red flags or things that you don't like so I think um

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:53.840
um I think it's safer to fall in love in a

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.640
when you get to know somebody not in the context of dating them like like Jim and Pam on the office

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.840
did you watch the office yeah because yeah of course I watched the office British office is

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:17.360
better strong words but yes um but yes so well yeah fine true it might be romantic yeah I like

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:23.520
the romantic you can fall for yeah it's fine you but just I think the better lesson is yes

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:27.360
that's one thing to say but the other is like when you see the red flags

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:34.000
notice them be a little better about noticing them but what if even amidst the passion what if

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:41.200
like a brilliant woman kind of threw herself in your path right she she having because talking

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.760
on a podcast is a little bit like having a blog where you over share because people learn

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:50.720
everything about you what you like what you what you don't like what your wants and dreams and

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:57.120
you know so some woman like could pretend to run it like throw herself in your path seemingly

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:03.920
accidentally and then you meet and she has a russian accent and probably works for fsb no but

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:11.040
whatever she is who she is and then um and then she sort of slides into the conversation like a

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:18.160
quote from the idiot right yeah yeah and you're like happens boom yep right and then but then

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:24.000
but but she's not who she that's all pretend and so you very quickly could fall in love with her

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:34.480
and she's gonna turn out to like enjoy the game of destroying your life yep uh you know that or

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:39.680
it's the love of my life it could be but not if she did all those things intentionally but you

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:45.200
you don't really know but you have to then pay attention to this that's the dark aspect here you

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:51.520
mentioned blog like i love i love when people have like stuff about themselves online because

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:56.640
you get to really learn i mean i'm a fan of podcasts i'm a fan of people it's i love learning

01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:02.400
about them the personal stuff and so on um hopefully for sort of for good reasons so the person

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:07.520
you can people you connect with the good ones are the ones that are going to be very sort of

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:14.560
empathetic and the bad ones are the ones that are going to be fake empathetic like they're going to

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:19.760
learn everything about you and use you to manipulate you as opposed to learn everything about you

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:25.680
to fall deeper in love with you as a friend or as a romantic partner or like genuine curiosity yeah

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:30.800
genuine curiosity like there's something you're drawing like imagine your dog leon had a blog

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:39.760
after oh yeah he does now yeah that's true he kind of does yeah but as when you met him right then

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:45.600
you'd be like what is this what what is there that's pulling me towards this creature this this this

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:50.480
entity like what is there and it'd be fascinating to learn more and then you fall in love with the

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:56.720
details not just with this some kind of ethereal thing yeah you don't know you have to pay attention

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:02.160
to the red flags you have to yeah i think one of them actually is is somebody who doesn't have that

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.720
kind of i mean plenty of people are private and they don't put stuff out about themselves online

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:13.440
for all kinds of very valid reasons but um somebody who does share a lot about themselves personally

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:20.560
is um maybe there's examples but it's probably not a sociopath if they're sharing all kinds of

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:27.760
sure sure but i mean on the other side um when you meet people yeah i still like the falling in

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:33.200
love quick because the red flags whether you see them early or later it doesn't matter i'd rather

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:41.840
see the red flags right away i go in hard intensely like uh and to clarify by going hard i mean like

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:50.720
you know um no small talk just get to know a person get to know quickly get to know the person

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:55.840
challenge travel with them travel with them is a really powerful road trip from hell or not

01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:02.000
go on a road trip and find out if it's a road trip from hell yeah but you might so there was

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.640
somebody i was this is also a male perspective destructive relationship with where we had already

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:14.240
fallen in love and then went for the first trip yeah um in a situation where we were like had to

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:18.640
borrow uh i guess he was sharing he was still sharing his car with his ex-wife so we had to

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:24.640
go to the garage to pick up the car to go on this little trip and um so you're literally baggage

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:34.960
yeah so but but um something happened where the the garage attendant was like wanted more

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:41.520
identification and it was a pain in the ass and anyway this guy was so unbelievably rude to

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:50.560
the garage attendant like just nasty and i was completely shocked and disturbed and we got in

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:56.400
the car for this long car ride and i i was like not saying anything and really shocked

01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:04.400
and then he noticed that and was very concerned and i explained you know like i just i never

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:12.160
i would never treat somebody that way and then he pretended to get incredibly upset and to feel

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:17.760
horrible and remorseful about it and it was like all we talked about for the next few hours and

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:23.440
then i kind of thought like well okay you know i can get over that and then the relationship

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.960
continued and it was a dark and destructive one whereas you know had i seen him behave that way

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:38.560
before we were in a relationship i would have known to back away okay but my the lesson you

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:44.800
could still walk away you could still walk away but and no you can't well i could have walked away

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:52.640
at any point with i call him mr fox because it's sort of depersonalizes him um but i could have

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.480
i could have walked away from him at any point in time but that's the whole

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:03.360
that's kind of the whole point of what they do and the whole reason why people don't understand it

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:10.880
um i mean it's it's this it's like being in a cult of one so the people who've been in

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:17.680
cults and gotten out we understand each other very well um because the same psychology was used

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:23.600
the same psychological tactics were used on us and then we experienced the same thing on the other

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.600
side of it which is it's hard for us to understand and it's hard for other people to understand

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:31.360
and everybody's saying that would never happen to me or they're saying i don't get it because

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:35.040
you're smart how could you let that happen why didn't you leave why didn't you walk away

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:41.360
and on the other side of it we don't have the answers or it takes a really long time of

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.160
of self-reflection and reading and investigation to try and figure out

01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:52.000
how it is that it happened and why didn't we walk away um no it's definitely i mean it's

01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:01.280
definitely hard at every level and i i just think that even for more subtle for sort of not

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:07.840
outrageously toxic relationships but like normal toxic not normal like a little bit toxic

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.640
there are some people that kind of thrive on conflict yeah but you could just still just be

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.520
self-aware like i think you've talked about give yourself time to think about the red flags

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:26.560
and like i pride myself on being able to walk away you have to you have to think like uh

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:34.160
is this is this the kind of thing i can live with in friendship and business partners and um

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:41.120
and because the little things that bother you turn out to be big things down the line so yeah

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:49.120
so it could be less romantic but i feel like like getting to know somebody slowly over time is

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:54.960
yeah it's the smarter thing it's safer fuck it though uh so but that's again my you know

01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:06.720
my you know russian slash ukrainian male perspective anyway so meeting mr fox

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:15.760
anthony that's a chapter title in my book meeting mr fox meeting mr fox so you're working uh on a

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:21.920
book about this i'm almost done it's taken a really long time can you define almost done

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:28.080
because i you know i've said that it's like it's when people say like um you know they're leaving

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:34.800
like i'm i'm almost in the car right and they they do actually they're not really they haven't

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:39.680
even started the showering yet or something so yeah i do i think i probably need some

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:48.160
like therapists to work with me on this um are you usually late to things no okay i'm usually

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:54.880
i'm usually oh i sent you a text message because i was early when i got here yeah and i said that

01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:06.640
i'm um um because of i think i said my crippling fear of being late i'm like always early so i'm

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:13.520
loitering outside like a weirdo but glad to come in if it's not too early the crippling fear of

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:18.640
being late makes me chronically early and today's no exception yeah it's interesting i got here

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:24.160
before i before i rang the bell yep i was outside for a little while like just killing time going

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:32.400
i'm way too early but it's really hot out oh that's true yeah because i'll yeah i'll i always air

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:36.320
like i was very early to the airport and then i had all this time to kill but that's fine with me

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:43.840
because that's actually time i appreciate because i can um write things or you know i worked on my

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:51.120
book draft on the on the airplane um mostly editing um which it needs a lot because it's

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.600
really long it's in word count so all the things are already completed and you're just editing

01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:02.960
down no i wish it's it's it's in five parts and i've written one through four and five part five

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:07.920
is like the chapters are all there but some of them are messy some of them are or some of them

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:15.520
are just like a few paragraphs some of them are just notes um some of them are done so i am kind

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:21.440
of almost it's like five parts and part five is not quite finished um what are you but i've been

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:28.400
editing along the way so so this is gonna come out in 2023 i think you mentioned so it won't come

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:35.200
out for a bit or we'll figure it out uh what have you learned about yourself from putting

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:39.680
some of these things down on paper what's like the darkest thing you realize about yourself

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:49.280
from writing the darkest um well one of the things that was fascinating is reading through

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:53.440
all of our the correspondence between him and me that i was able to find because he deleted all

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:58.080
our emails but he he didn't i think he thought he deleted all of our g chats but he didn't

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:05.680
oh so he had access to your email yes deleted on that side too and he yeah he had access to my email

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:12.400
most of the time um and then at the end was also emailing people as me which was incredibly

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:18.880
mortifying to come home and then get back into my old email and find that and i think um he was also

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:24.240
texting people as me and those i'll never know unless somebody brings it to my attention because

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:30.720
after a certain date in 2015 he had my phone and he had exclusive access to my phone and email

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:39.520
so i wasn't looking at it until i got out until after we were arrested um and i was out on bail

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:43.920
at my sister's and it took me a long time to get back into my gmail because i had to verify who i

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:49.280
am and um and i never got my phone back so i don't know what he texted to other people

01:40:50.000 --> 01:41:00.880
as me after that time but anyway i was able to recover um a lot of our g chats which we

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.240
used that i don't know why people don't use it anymore but it used to be a thing yeah it was

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:10.240
like if you work with people and you use gmail it's a really easy way to just message back and

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.560
as a chat client within uh google but i think google shut it down already or no

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:20.400
i think it's still there okay and nobody nobody i used to talk to people on there and nobody

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:31.120
talked to me anymore and so i i'd rather be thank you i just i don't yeah people don't love google

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.000
social products for some reason the social network they tried several times google plus

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:42.000
it just dies out something about it it's like when microsoft tries to do stuff it just doesn't feel

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.840
right anyway it is it is very lonely in that google chat window it makes total sense though

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:52.720
anyway so that was still there so you're reading through them so finding you know being able to go

01:41:52.720 --> 01:42:00.160
back and read and then i kept finding like more layers of stuff um and including a journal that

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:07.120
i didn't find the the da the prosecutor found written by me my journal that i thought he'd

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:14.720
thrown away i didn't know it existed so um somehow we still had it and they found my

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:23.440
my journal which was for the year 2014 and the very beginning of 2015 um this is after you got

01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:29.440
this is in the middle of it it was in the middle of it yeah so reading that was fascinating um

01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:36.720
yeah what what what's some interesting things there what was it was your mind completely

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:44.720
detached it was weird because no were you concerned were you in love were you afraid i

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:51.280
was not in love i was afraid i definitely write repeatedly in there that i'm afraid of him i also

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:56.400
reply write repeatedly things like i don't know what's going on like please let this be over

01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:02.080
please let this be over please let this be over and then in a sort of if i try to remove myself

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:07.600
and look at it as if i was a different person it's sort of heartbreaking because i was trying so hard

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:18.480
to be positive and um and that didn't work out you know trying to be positive so but when i

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:27.680
i it turned up later in the process and um my lawyer at the time called or something and said

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:35.680
um you know the da has your or the prosecutor that they have your journal i haven't read it yet but

01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.640
as soon as i get a pdf copy i'll send it to you so that was sort of weird to think that everybody's

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:44.320
reading my journal which you know you don't write it thinking people are going to read unless you're

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:50.560
like a historical person and then later on you think people are going to print from it but you

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:56.160
know nobody's writing just imagine like like a 14 year old thinking they're going to be a historical

01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:01.920
person right well no i mean like you know presidents who keep journals and then they're later on sure

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.160
sure you know so you write it you don't think everybody anybody's going to read it and so that

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:12.960
was a weird feeling and then also just not knowing having you know not remembering what i wrote um

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:20.720
so i think it was the next day i got she sent me a pdf copy of it and i read it really quickly

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:25.120
because i could read my own it was a pdf so it was like xeroxes of the pages so it was in my

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:29.680
own handwriting which i could read really fast because even though it's messy i i wrote it so i

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:35.200
could read it really fast and i i read the whole thing and was crying because i thought okay finally

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:42.400
like surely nobody could read this and think that i intended to commit crimes and so i thought like

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:49.040
i thought that journal was just going to fully exonerate me and they would like you know if not

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:53.680
drop the charges like it would just be like okay well you know some bad things happened you're

01:44:53.680 --> 01:45:00.000
responsible you know here's probation but it didn't seem to make any difference which was

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:08.800
strange um but anyway so the journal and then also finding all of the correspondence between

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:12.560
not all of the correspondence between him and me but the the g chat correspondence between him and

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:20.240
me um to me so you know all of that in its entire like i wish that everything could have been

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.440
kind of put out there as evidence like the more they turned up the better for me because

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:31.280
i wanted them to see everything and there are just so many examples in the correspondence

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:38.720
between him and me where he's you know threatening me and um you know lying to me and telling me that

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:42.080
if i don't do what he says my whole life will be destroyed and i'll lose everything i ever cared

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:49.200
about all kinds of things like that but what was what i still don't quite understand and what one

01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:54.000
of my lawyers said why all of that wasn't as useful as i thought it might be is because

01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:02.720
so much of that correspondence i'm um like sarcastically angrily i'm yelling at him i'm mad

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:09.040
at him i'm like fuck you i'm making fun of him i call him names um i'll say to him like you're

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:14.960
lying why should i believe you you told me you'd pay me back before but you didn't so it seems

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:21.120
like it doesn't it seems like it doesn't make sense like how is it that if i say to him you're

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:27.280
lying you're a liar that i still but so then what would happen is i'm reading those that

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:33.600
correspondence and then it stops for a while maybe because i was with him in person yeah um and then

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:38.880
i'll look at like my timeline of things and i'll see like oh i sent him a wire for 80 000 like

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:48.960
yeah how do you explain your ability to still uh joke around and also to be like mean to him in

01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:56.480
a joking way like you know couples can do that i guess like i mean there's there's like cruel

01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.600
ways of doing that and then there's like humorous ways just like you're talking shit whatever uh

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:07.600
you're able to do that still and yet you're sending over the money and and are afraid

01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.680
like how can you be those two things

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.920
like it's supposed to completely shutting down

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:19.360
on well i don't know i mean these are all interesting questions that i have as well

01:47:19.360 --> 01:47:26.000
like how is it that i was functional yeah and yet also doing these things and so

01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:31.840
the year that we were gone is like a different level because i no longer was running the

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:38.320
business but the thing about dissociation is that you're functioning but like your feelings

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:43.440
and your thinking are detached in some way so that like you're functioning and people wouldn't

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:48.480
look at you and go that person's dissociating because you're functioning you seem normal but

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.440
somehow in your head there's you're like disconnecting your feelings and your thinking

01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:00.480
so so you're still able to be like like the the game of social interaction like being witty and

01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:04.960
so on all that kind of stuff you still for me i think it's like a coping mechanism too because

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:09.760
i'll like if i went i haven't been to a funeral a long time but if i went i'd probably like find

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:18.160
absurd thing you know or all tend to like either make jokes or want to make jokes at

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:24.000
really inappropriate times even in tragic times because it's almost like a like a defense

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:31.600
mechanism i think you said uh you told me you like dark humor yeah i i uh my next door neighbor is

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:39.040
michael malice he's an anarchist i have one of his books the hero dear reader dear reader yeah

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:45.600
and he loves he embodies dark humor trolling and dark humor and and is underneath the sweetest

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:51.040
human being because he's writing a book now the white pill that's really focused on

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:58.000
stalin and holland more there's basically atrocities throughout the 20th century and

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:04.960
i think he needs the dark humor to release the valve i think there's something about incredibly

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:14.320
good the most offensive comedians tend to have the kindest hearts i think this is my theory people

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:21.920
like ricky gervais you know who goes out and insults people and makes jokes that people find

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:30.240
horribly offensive and crude and um and and yet you know is a huge animal rights guy and and appears

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:36.880
to be an incredibly sweet and kind person and sensitive and you know howard stern people who

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:46.000
are like incredibly crude very often are in my experience to the extent that i've gotten either

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.680
to know people personally observe them learn about them in other ways but the almost like the the

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:59.040
more crude and offensive the the comedian or the person they they tend to have the kindest

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:03.120
like yeah i don't know if it's a universal rule but yeah i see what you mean well you lost me

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:08.000
with howard stern i he seems like not a good person oh no he's such a good person underneath

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:13.120
it oh yeah such a good person he's just said so much so i'm friends with rogan he said so

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.160
many ignorant things about rogan but i suppose that's um so i haven't heard i haven't i haven't

01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:24.480
listened to howard stern in a long time and i also think that people who say bad things about rogan

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:30.560
don't listen to his podcast right because if i've i've listened to his podcast and like people think

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:37.280
that i think people would assume that i don't like him because or the whole like vegan thing

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:43.120
and he's all about meat and they would think that i would think no i mean because i've listened to

01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:51.120
enough of his podcast i've i've heard the one where he talked about why he hunts and um whereas

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:58.000
if i if i only knew him via his instagram i might think he's an asshole yeah but having listened to

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.560
all of his oh not all of i don't listen to all of them there's a ton of them um but having listened

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:09.280
to a lot of his podcasts enough to know that um you know he's an extremely kind person with all

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:15.440
the best intentions and i think that a lot of that judgment comes from people who are just seeing

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:20.720
little clips because it's probably easy to take little clips from him that sound yeah the lesson

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:25.200
there is just not make judgments on on people without getting to know them especially and you

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:31.280
have no excuse when the content is out there like don't be lazy yeah i try that's um yeah i'm very

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:40.720
careful when um you know a lot of these cases um you know like the the dep herd thing or oh uh

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:47.520
johnny depp and and elizabeth holmes and anything like controversial and sometimes that makes me

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:53.040
i can't think of an example but very often um like when somebody criticizes something or something

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:57.600
becomes controversial that's what gets me to want to understand it better so then i'll go like read

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:02.400
the book that everybody's mad about yeah it's hard to know what's true though so i i tried i tried to

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:07.040
have humility and always assume i don't really know the full story and keep pulling at the string

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:12.240
keep learning more and more but even then like the more you learn the more you realize the things

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:21.040
that complex complex uh what do you think about as a small tangent um johnny depp amber heard

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:27.120
trials going on it's a quick pause it's going to resume next week so again this is one of those

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:31.920
situations where you know i have very limited information because i'm also not sitting there

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:37.280
watching the trial yeah have you watched any of it little bits of it and it's like i know that if

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:43.120
i go there then i'm gonna want to watch it all yeah it's good i know i really it's raw

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:49.760
human relationships so there's most toxic and it's most deep also because there's you can

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:53.920
tell there's love probably still there's love which is the interesting thing they probably

01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:59.680
still love each other even though they hate each other um and like there's a lot of lying going on

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:07.440
it looks like it's amber heard lying to my foolish eyes it seems like she's lying non-stop

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:13.840
but you know i want to know the full story and we'll never get to know it but you see this raw

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:19.760
like post-mortem on a relationship on a love affair that was clearly passionate there was

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:25.680
clearly something deep of a connection there and it just that's the sad thing about love it can

01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:31.440
destroy you as much as it can uplift you so there don't be also used to destroy people

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:37.520
yeah to manipulate and all that kind of stuff yeah right so people who um feel that strongly

01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:45.280
are i think particularly vulnerable um yeah it's it's hard to talk about because

01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:53.520
i've dipped into like a podcast or something where other people are were discussing bad vegan

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:58.640
in like a pop culture way and they're analyzing it and it's so annoying to listen to because

01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.320
i'm like oh my god that's totally wrong that's totally wrong well if they only knew this well

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:09.120
i have nope that's wrong so it you know yeah listening to other people analyzing um my

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:13.920
situation or my psychology when they don't have all the information has been really frustrating

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:18.640
there's a difference i did there's a difference because the world doesn't

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:24.080
know much about you except for the Netflix documentary right there's a lot more information

01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:29.120
about both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and the trial is revealing the real this one is so

01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:34.080
interesting but i haven't watched it all okay but but there's a difference between a documentary

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:40.720
and like a raw human being exactly the real trial you can see the body language the and so

01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:46.000
interesting that i think you could tell the difference between a person who is full of

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:53.920
shit and not i know i'm not sure it's another i'm gonna i can't remember and sorry so i keep

01:54:53.920 --> 01:55:00.160
interrupting you but on top of this they're actors too which is very annoying because right exactly

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.480
because like i don't know if they're putting it be sure as hell looks like amber heard is putting on

01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:12.480
um like a soap opera act soap opera meaning like really bad acting and lies but i would say all

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:19.120
of these things are really hard people would say about me i don't look like a victim and i don't

01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:23.040
mind you interrupting me because andrew huberman said that's that means you're interested in the

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:29.360
car you said it was a good thing so you don't have to apologize i think i think interrupt me

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.800
keeps coming up but i keep thinking of these that that's one of the things that andrew told me that

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:39.920
i'm like i are you sure because it just doesn't seem like an asshole thing to do i don't i guess

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:44.320
it depends on the context if we're in a business meeting and somebody you know talks over you to

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:49.600
kind of make their point heard but if it's a one-on-one situation then it's not i could

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:55.600
argue that forever but so a long time ago i listened to there was a audio call um an audio

01:55:55.600 --> 01:56:03.040
that was released of a taped argument between johnny dapp and amber heard um and i don't remember why

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:07.200
like which one of them had taped it and if they knew it was being taped but it was like an hour

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.720
and a half and i listened to it almost like you would listen to a podcast where i was doing other

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:16.160
things i was like cleaning my apartment and i was fascinated listening to it to a fight so i was and

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:20.400
it's interesting too because it was just the audio not so you're not looking at their body language

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.680
which can be completely misleading and there was another podcast where they talked about how

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:32.080
judges make worse decisions on whether or not somebody deserves you know parole or to be

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:37.520
released on bail when they see the person in person versus if they're just looking at the

01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:43.280
information on paper so i think body language and those kinds of things can be can actually be

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:48.400
misleading um or we think that like by looking somebody in the eye will know if they're lying

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:57.520
or not but the skilled liars are able to um bypass that or they because i'm jumping all over the

01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:01.840
place but one of the things about sociopaths is they're not going to have the same tells so

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:07.600
like if i was lying somebody would know because i'm like stressed out mortified i'm probably doing

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:13.120
all the things that we do when we lie because it's stressful for me whereas they don't have

01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:18.080
those things so i think that you know they could for example i think that they could pass a lie

01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:25.040
detector test they also don't have like a startle response so that's the activity in their brain

01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:30.880
like if you and i watched something graphic and tragic on tv or watched something happen like

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:34.960
things would happen in our brains that don't happen in the brains of sociopaths so they don't

01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:40.240
react to things in the same way that that we do again but that makes them assuming i'm not

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:44.160
associate i didn't say i'm not a sociopath this assumption you keep making is very interesting

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:49.760
then why did i murder all those people let's get back to the um what were we talking about

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:55.520
johnny dapp and amber heard so the audio that i heard made me without knowing anything else

01:57:55.520 --> 01:58:04.000
made me very inclined to be team johnny dapp yeah based on that based just based on that audio

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.400
yeah well that's how the people are feeling about this whole interaction by the way i do think it's

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.400
a very healthy thing to do in a relationship is to record each other for months at a time

01:58:13.440 --> 01:58:18.560
every time you fight that just seems like a very um that's sarcasm i don't i don't understand how

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:24.800
because they both recorded each other it it's just it i suppose you could look back at all

01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:30.720
human relations and be like this was ridiculous what was i doing but when you're in it you don't

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:38.480
right i wondered that too like who made the recording and why and um and did they both

01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:42.960
know about it that it was being recorded sometimes they did sometimes they didn't

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:50.960
uh all i know is just the poetry of johnny dapp's speaking and sort of um

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:58.800
movement about the whole thing it's interesting it makes me wonder what's real maybe this is whole

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:04.800
maybe maybe they're both in love and this is like a troll that they played on the world i don't know

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.840
it's it makes me wonder what's real at all

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:15.360
like i because they're you have to remember they're actors too yeah i don't think he would

01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:22.560
have filed the lawsuit if no i mean i'm joking yes no i know but but no i mean my point is um

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:27.440
yes yeah if somebody was trying to make the argument that like he's the abuser

01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:32.640
and that he's lying and he's full of shit it sort of doesn't make sense that he would have

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:40.960
filed the lawsuit unless he's trying to have this all come out in the open because he believes he's

01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:46.320
in the right you know again i don't i have no idea i agree with you i agree with you as a fan of

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:50.800
love and human nature i appreciate the fact that they went through this i know it's probably

01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:58.240
extremely painful but it's it's fascinating to watch human relationships be presented in such a

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:03.680
be presented in such a raw way and it made me realize how rare it is to get a glimpse like that

02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:08.640
yeah and i think one of the reasons i like that book confessions of a sociopath also is

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:16.640
it's you know female who's writing it and i think um statistically men are more likely to be

02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:25.760
sociopaths maybe not i mean these are all things where a lot of times there exist statistics that

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:34.480
would be inherently hard to get so who knows but i think that people tend to think of sociopaths

02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:41.520
more as men and then which probably gives female sociopaths the advantage and that people are less

02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:49.440
likely to um like the elizabeth holmes like people who are really manipulative and really good at it

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:56.800
um and and part of how they're able to succeed is that people don't understand their motives

02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:01.760
or people will assume that people behave rationally even if rationally means

02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:08.320
it's like anthony strangers you know it would have made more sense if he had gotten all this

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.240
money out of me and you know put it in an overseas account and then ditched me and got on a plane to

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:22.320
mexico like everybody would understand that more whereas you know the way things happened and he

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:27.920
dragged me around the country and like what were we doing in tennessee and then why didn't like

02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:36.800
nothing really makes any sense but and also all the things that he did to me and had me do it was

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:45.520
as if all of those things together only make sense if his primary goal was to maximally

02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:51.120
destroy me and also make it like have me burn all my bridges and make it so i'll never recover

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:57.680
and when you read a book like that you understand that that's that's what he wanted like that's his

02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:03.840
life so it's like a game like what what do you think it's about power and it's a game do you

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:09.520
think he understood the long-term goals he has or was it the short-term game of it that he enjoyed

02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:14.400
the ability to destroy you well yeah it was the short-term game of it because i'm sure another

02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:23.360
human yeah and also i think for him like their motivations are just different so

02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:29.280
you know he spent a year incarcerated because he never got out on bail but then he got out

02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:35.680
um he's out of prison though he got out before i went in to serve my time which was

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:46.400
um particularly you know like psychologically i had to try really hard not to be infuriated and

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:54.640
but anyway so i think for him you know the consequence of spending time in jail sort

02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:00.880
of like an inconvenience you know it's like life is a game and so he wouldn't feel

02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:09.920
if you're not capable of being emotionally hurt then you're you know you have immense power

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:15.440
because you can go around and do things and people can't hurt you it's like a superpower and he did

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:20.000
this for people who are not familiar i guess he did this to other women yes

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:32.160
yes i think it was in the documentary that his i guess ex-wife from somewhere else was florida

02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:40.240
florida of course florida sorry strong strong words well it's just like when there's the

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:46.720
weirdest story about you know people eating tide pods and then doing crazy it's like it's always in

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:50.640
it's always in florida so i feel like whenever crazy thing so to me it makes sense that he would

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:55.520
have spent time in florida before and that's where crazy in a good way and i mean that on an

02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:02.400
insult on him i also like she's an amazing person yes so it's it's like it's him that i'm making the

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:11.200
like florida is a bit weird yes she he manipulated her as well lied to her that kind of things um

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:16.080
well jumping around but one of the things you said that was disturbingly misleading is the

02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:24.160
ending of the documentary and the the ending has a phone call i think yeah of you and anthony

02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:32.240
talking so high level let me ask uh how many times have you talked with anthony since you got

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:40.000
out of prison and what did you talk about and why is that quote misleading that uh a segment

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.040
of audio misleading my issue with it also was that it was deliberately misleading which was

02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:53.360
what was particularly um infuriating about it infuriating about it um and then also there was

02:04:54.480 --> 02:05:00.480
it was like there were things one major thing that was incorrect that i think helped allow

02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:06.800
people to make an incorrect conclusion at the end was um in the in the film it talks about

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:11.360
i say something about how my accountant made a joke about if i married him he could easily

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:17.680
transfer me money without tax consequences and then the film has me saying something like you

02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.960
know and then within 24 hours we were married but that's like audio from here and audio from

02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:28.080
here spliced together so they made it seem like there's like i married him because it was like

02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:34.080
he could give me money and that wasn't the case so you're part mastermind of some kind of scheme

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:39.200
that involve money transfer and you got married and that kind of right or if nothing else i had

02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:44.320
like i was trying to get money that's why i married him so which is absurd because again

02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:48.880
you know new york is full of legitimate people with loads of money if i really wanted to marry

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:54.640
somebody for money in new york it wouldn't be that hard to do but anyway it was like it was just a

02:05:54.640 --> 02:06:02.000
deliberate making it seem like my intention was you know to marry him for his fictitious money

02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:08.800
okay so that's one but either way let's go to that ending thing because because we're on that

02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:19.120
sort of topic because when you got out of prison you know what the film implies is that whatever

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:25.600
there's a small aspect of your mind that still wants to continue a relationship with anthony

02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:31.600
yeah that's not the case and not just that but there's still flirtation and that kind of

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:42.880
a body like we got the the world like at our fingertips we're playing so i mean one of the

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:49.760
exciting things about being like a couple that's fucking with the world that's getting away with

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:58.160
something is that there's all these powerful forces that want to catch you in a crime and

02:06:58.160 --> 02:07:06.080
you keep getting away with it that's exciting in some romantic world it could be although not in

02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:11.680
this case right and also i always have to keep reminding people like get away with what because

02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:18.160
i lost everything and all these people lost other you know people i cared about lost a lot

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:26.640
my mother lost a lot but i lost everything too yeah your um your restaurant and all my dream

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:34.480
yeah my reputation my stuff my home you know ending up with millions of dollars of debt

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:38.720
like it's not even like i lost it all and then it's a clean slate it's like i lost it all and

02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:50.240
now i have this like giant boulder of or like this wobbly unclear how to like yeah so when people say

02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.560
well sisyphus got away with something i'm always like got away with what i know destroying my life

02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:02.480
and ending up in debt because that's it's not even like you can't even sort of point to like

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:07.120
as if i was trying to do something and then oops that happened it's like there's no

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:17.360
nothing that logically makes sense if somebody was trying to um uh decipher my you know whatever

02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:22.800
motives i might have had yeah you didn't walk away from the explosion you were inside the explosion

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:31.680
okay but that said the movie implied and so i mean it's interesting to ask um not just

02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:40.240
in in clarifying the movie but just as a human being you're out of prison he's out of prison

02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:50.560
um there was you know there was that um toxic connection but it was there and there's a depth

02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:57.520
to it so toxic connections can be pretty deep so how what what was the conversation like and how

02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:04.800
often have you talked with him well we don't speak anymore um and that call at the end was

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:11.760
even on gchat recorded was recorded on like i recorded the call and gave it to them

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:16.400
you know so i was like deliberately recording him it's not like i was caught on a hot mic

02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:21.120
like i made that call it's part of the documentary i recorded him intentionally i was trying to get

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:27.520
him to repeat some of like the kookier things he would say about like his meat suit or some of the

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:34.560
weird like the things about something not being real the more like fantastical things i was trying

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.280
to get him to repeat those things it was probably like a 40 minute call which i mean it's actually

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:43.440
on my phone i still have it i haven't gone back to listen to it but you ever think of publishing

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:47.680
that whole thing oh yeah oh i think about publishing everything my entire journal all

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:54.560
you should publish that call unedited just publish it yeah fun no i want to publish like a lot of

02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.240
stuff he took all these videos of me also that they used a couple of clips of and i would yeah

02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:04.080
i mean i would they're also on my phone i would publish them all i would publish everything

02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:11.760
in particular um because you release that with your book it's good yeah i probably i mean i've

02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:16.880
planned to do that eventually if all of that material would be really useful to

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:23.600
um psychologists or people studying it so to the extent that it would help other people

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:29.360
understand what happened um which he's still out there meaningful yeah he's still out there

02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:36.160
doing weird weird shit with his clean slate i get a little annoyed about that he's got the

02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:42.320
clean slate well he didn't have a restaurant he didn't have a persona does he have any public

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:49.040
persona or no or we don't know he got booted off of twitter he had ilan will put him back on

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:55.280
is that a passive aggressive state no not at all i i find that whole conversation really

02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.440
interesting um whether to put somebody like anthony on back on twitter well no i think

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:06.160
because i used to always think like if only everybody had to identify as themselves on

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.280
twitter and you could have like a parody account yeah or like like leon has an account but it's

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:16.800
very clear that it's me behind it or sometimes there's like you know devin nuna's cow like so

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:24.320
people have parody accounts but but if we could identify who it is then um a lot of why did he

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:31.520
get booted off of twitter i don't know but i used to so in the last few years i would periodically

02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:37.040
probably like once a month maybe more i would like look at his twitter just to kind of see like well

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:45.200
where is he and um you know like just to see like what is he up to and um and i figured out i could

02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:50.080
tell from the photographs that he'd moved to california and i think he might have told me

02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:56.960
one of the last times i spoke to him that he was going to move to california but um and then i

02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:02.560
also screen grabbed a lot of stuff that he put on twitter and he put these creepy videos of himself

02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:08.400
on twitter at the beginning of covid i screen grabbed those um just and then one day i went

02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:13.600
and like he was you know account was suspended and then i kept going back and it's like been

02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:18.400
suspended ever since so he might have started a new account and i don't i don't know what it is

02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:25.520
probably he's probably in california you're saying he is in california that's been verified

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:30.640
somebody who was going to have to interact with him in an official capacity was going to go meet

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:39.040
him and i said and was nervous about it and i said um he's going to be really likable like you're

02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:44.320
going to like him he's probably going to like figure out what you're interested in talk sports

02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:48.800
talk whatever it is that he figures out quickly that you're interested in he's going to be really

02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:54.160
nice he's going to seem like a nice guy and that person later got back to me was like you're exactly

02:12:54.160 --> 02:13:01.040
right um so yeah that's the that's the sociopath thing right yeah extremely careful but inside

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:07.520
relationship that's even more dangerous like so i think that part of the reason i spoke to him was

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:15.040
entirely self-serving and strategic after the fact or well even before i knew there was ever

02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:22.480
going to be a documentary i spoke to him and i and i knew how dangerous it was because i knew that

02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:28.560
in a situation like this you're supposed to have no contact which makes sense and i understand why

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:33.840
which makes it extra tragic when people have kids with a sociopath or in a narcissistic abusive

02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:39.920
relationship if you have kids then you're tethered which is tragic but why are you supposed

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:44.400
to avoid conversations because you can get pulled right back so they have no contact yeah because

02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:50.800
they'll continue abuse or they'll you'll be vulnerable to them being able to pull you back

02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:59.040
in so i knew that to be the case um but why was it self-serving why did you talk to him anyway

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:07.520
yeah because he was getting out um he was going to be out free out in the open while i was going

02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:14.640
to be locked up at reichers for three and a half months and the one thing that you know if his

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:21.680
motivation was to destroy me then what what else could he do to really like you know hammer that

02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:29.840
last nail in the coffin yeah that would be leon and so he would have known that leon would be

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:34.240
staying with my mother you know he knows where he spent a lot of time at our house he knows where

02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:40.480
she lives it would be super easy for him to just drive up there you know wait for her to let him

02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:47.840
out and then you know he because out in the country he can be off leash and all he'd have to do is

02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:54.000
kind of whistle call him over and he could take him away and do whatever so i was completely

02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:00.080
like gripped with that fear it's not fear for yourself but fear for leon

02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:08.240
well i was going to be at least safe from him but i was going to be locked away so oh yeah yeah

02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:15.280
reichers yeah yeah sure so i got it got it got it got it i would be powerless to do any things

02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:23.360
and he would be have free rein to go destroy me further by um you know taking or hurting leon

02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:33.200
and then when he got out i still um i had unfollowed him from my own account but i

02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:40.640
leon had never on him so i i was looking at i know i was looking at his um at his account

02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:46.800
okay i just say because uh because joe has a um his he has an account for his dog too i just

02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:52.240
love when people do that it's so great because i actually pretend in my mind for some reason i do

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:57.520
think leon has an account like i don't you forget that there's a human behind it you're like oh okay

02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:03.840
cool yeah i know i love it when people do that anyway so continue so leon didn't unfollow him

02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:12.720
and what so i was able to go back and look at his twitter and um i see he he somehow he quickly

02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:19.920
got a phone but he very quickly started tweeting right after he got out and um and i was kind of

02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.480
like fascinated because i didn't know what to expect or what he was going to be saying and

02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:30.480
and um and then he started saying things that i could tell were directed at me you know like

02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:35.840
little things that only i would know um you know like random things like things that were

02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:41.360
like the equivalent of like an inside joke that you have just so he was posting things like that

02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:48.960
and um um there's so many things going on at once so another thing that would have in a

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:52.400
twisted but i think understandable way

02:16:52.560 --> 02:17:02.320
way in sort of a sick way that i was fully aware of is that here i am having gone through this

02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:07.040
completely like messed up thing that now i'm in trouble for everybody's looking at and nobody

02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:14.400
understands right and so there was this unfortunate situation of the only person who understands

02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:21.280
what i went through is the person who put me through it yeah right so

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.680
is that were you also just a little bit seeking closure of some kind

02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:31.280
probably a lot but also with the awareness that i probably wasn't going to get it you know and i

02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:40.240
mean i i know for a fact i would never get it in the same way that which is why um which is why

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:46.800
i was able to later on like in the context of recording those calls i was able to talk to him

02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:54.960
um in this detached way because i know he doesn't give a shit that like he doesn't give any shits

02:17:54.960 --> 02:18:01.600
about what he did to my mother or me or anybody or anything just doesn't care so he's certainly

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:09.360
not going to care if i you know he's never going to say like i'm sorry or i did a bad thing or

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:14.960
or like he's not going to be affected like if i yelled and screamed at him that would just be

02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:21.600
frustrating for me and he would actually probably be gratified by that so so that that gave you uh

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:28.560
that empowered you in being cold and sort of yes and i had a prior experience

02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.960
where i had to do the same thing where like if you're if you're able to be very

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:42.960
cold and not allow somebody to push your buttons then you're taking away their power and then that

02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:49.520
feels empowering or feels like reclaiming a little bit of your power so in my talking to him i always

02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:55.200
had a reason you know like there was always like i didn't want him to hurt leon or i wanted

02:18:55.200 --> 02:19:01.280
information or i wanted to know where he was i'd rather let him think that you know maybe he could

02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:07.680
still manipulate me one day or whatever it was like safer to keep that there than to not know

02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:12.800
where he was and if i was going to like be walking leon and turn the corner and he's standing there

02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:18.720
and you know like it like if there's a crazy murderer out on the loose you'd rather know

02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:24.880
where they are than have no i have no idea so there are a lot of different reasons um why does

02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:30.480
it upset you why was it wrong to have that audio clip at the end of the documentary like what did

02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:35.440
it uh well because it implied all kinds of things that were completely not true and it also just

02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:41.840
didn't make sense and it confused people and um so so for people who haven't watched this spoiler

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:48.720
alert is they play the the clip of um so i don't even remember what was said but it was kind of

02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:55.680
that last what we spoke about yeah what was the what was i know i only watched like i still

02:19:55.680 --> 02:20:02.400
haven't watched it i only watched the film once yeah while you know people were looking at me

02:20:02.400 --> 02:20:07.200
for my reaction and i was crying and it was really weird and strange and surreal

02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:10.560
and i haven't gone back to watch it again i feel like i'm just gonna get more annoyed

02:20:11.200 --> 02:20:19.760
but i i will eventually but and when i when the ending happened i immediately blurred it out

02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:26.160
like i hate that i hate that ending but i sort of assumed a lot of people saw it for what it was

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:31.280
they saw that it was like the director doing a weird thing and that it was kind of just weird

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:34.960
and off and like that doesn't make sense yeah it seemed out of the blue but so it was basically

02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:42.080
you joking around like flirting almost it made it seem like as if we're still friendly yeah um

02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:49.600
and there's more to come it's almost like there's going to be a um bad vegan too right or

02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:56.000
yeah and then also i mean it made it seem like you know if i was laughing with him that i

02:20:56.880 --> 02:21:01.440
don't take anything seriously you know that i don't take what happened seriously or

02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:09.040
yeah don't feel any remorse exactly why the yeah and they after that he goes to the credits with

02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:17.120
the wild world which is a great song yes baby it's a wild world i never got to hear that because

02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:22.000
the version i watched didn't have the end credits but i knew that they used that song at the end

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:30.880
um and paid a lot for it yeah yeah i was like oh well you got this song did you ever say

02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:38.800
what was the darkest thing about yourself that you discover from the book oh we took no we took

02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:43.680
attention right because we started talking about exactly yeah about the g chats and i think um

02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:52.400
it was i guess it was trying to understand how i was able to be sarcastic and make jokes at his

02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:56.960
expense dirt while all that stuff was going on

02:21:58.880 --> 02:22:04.320
ah so what is that does that have you figured out what that means about you

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:12.560
no no it just was interesting to look at and also i think um

02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:20.400
you know i've i have a tendency i have a tendency sometimes to be sort of like jokingly

02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:25.840
hyperbolic or sarcastic and it's gotten me into trouble one

02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:38.080
one time i got locked up in the harlem psych ward for a day because of my hyperbole and sarcasm

02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:44.720
and like this sort of do you want to tell the story lost in translation errors that's that's a heck of

02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:52.800
a loss in translation error yeah did you did you say something funny to a therapist it was um yeah

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:58.720
i mean i was sort of making jokes about how bad i was feeling but in a hyperbolic way and so then

02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:04.160
suddenly somebody told somebody and then the loss in translation and then they were worried that i

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:08.880
might kill myself and then did a wellness check and then tried to call me and i was in the shower

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:14.000
so i didn't answer the phone so then somebody called the police to do a wellness check on me

02:23:15.200 --> 02:23:23.200
things just escalated and then uh not knowing that um if i had handled it the right if i had

02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:29.200
immediately um if i'd sort of understood what was going on and handled it the right way immediately

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:33.520
i probably could have gotten out of it but they err on the side of taking you to the hospital

02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:38.000
no matter what makes a lot of sense and i didn't know that and it also um so you really leaned into

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:44.240
the joke by going to the hospital i didn't it's sort of one of those situations that was

02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:52.160
both comical and tragic because and would actually make a really good um it's weird how

02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:57.600
i do this sometimes like it would make a really good scene in a in a filmed version who would play

02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:04.320
you in the film uh i don't know there is a thing being made that's sharon stone because um play

02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:12.400
because have you cast the scene yet no but there's a thing being made that i have nothing to do with

02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:18.480
which is frustrating and weird what film about you about it's like somebody's making a fictionalized

02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:25.600
drama and it's frustrating because for all kinds of obvious reasons it's like annoying and it can

02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:31.200
go any way it could go any way you could be like the bad guy inevitably they'll get a bajillion

02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:36.480
things wrong and there are also a bunch of people like profiting off of it and like thanks guys

02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:42.960
you know so it's infuriating for all kinds of reasons do you know who's playing who are the

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:48.640
actors no i don't even like i just don't like i'll i'll inevitably know but i don't really want to

02:24:48.640 --> 02:24:53.840
know the whole thing is just annoying and also i've always people ask me this all the time and i

02:24:53.840 --> 02:25:00.960
always thought um because of the way everything that happened was such a kind of a slow build

02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:06.080
and there was so much nuance and it's it's kind of really hard to understand that it could only

02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:13.680
really be done well in like a breaking bad type of series long like a long series where like you

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:21.920
would be taken through these kind of gut-wrenching icky slow build things and then people that would

02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:28.160
make it all make sense like that if it was done that way it could be done accurately but the reason

02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:34.960
why i think um so i made these stupid jokes and then somebody did a wellness check and um

02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:41.440
or have you asked the police to do it well when they knocked on my door and came in it was like

02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:46.880
a repeat of getting arrested so i sort of weirdly flashed back to that and then burst into tears

02:25:46.880 --> 02:25:52.480
which isn't the appropriate response if you're trying to um diffuse a

02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:00.000
if you're trying to discourage the people coming to do the wellness check from taking you to the

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:06.000
hospital starting to cry is not the good the right reaction well the thing is i mean

02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:16.400
there is it's funny but it could be also through the joke that the joke the best jokes are grounded

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:25.040
in any truth and pain in this case pain yeah all right so there you know it's um have you ever

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.080
if i may ask considered suicide yes

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:42.400
when well i'm kind of a wimp so i mean i'm afraid of all of the gruesome ways but um

02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:54.160
one of the things i remember doing is sort of hoarding medications which i had when um

02:26:55.760 --> 02:27:01.520
around the time and before he took me away because i wanted like i wanted to

02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:09.680
i wanted the safety of a like an out um and but around that time so when it went

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.080
that's the the road trip right before the road trip from hell you're around that time yeah

02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:19.520
hoarding medication and like i yeah like if i could get my hands on any sort of weird medication i

02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:27.440
would i would kind of hold on to it um and to all the chaos but i think i knew that it

02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:32.400
would be hard to do it that way so you were thinking about it but i never

02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:43.520
in that really tough time you know you're thinking about you're thinking about taking your own life

02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:53.040
if we'll give you hope we'll give you sort of because the business the the restaurant

02:27:53.040 --> 02:28:00.480
that you give so much of yourself to is lost you're lying to everybody you're in the hole

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:09.360
financially you're being psychologically trapped manipulated go kill myself now

02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:16.480
yeah well you're still there um please don't see i made a joke about it like that's there you go

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:27.040
um but it's always there it's the uh albert camus you know says you basically always have to be

02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:36.320
aggressively looking for a reason to live otherwise what's the point yeah otherwise

02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:40.480
it's easy to to go the other way because why live is a very good question

02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:49.040
but anyways as by way of hope by way you know it's a dark time it's a dark time if you could

02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:56.560
sort of look back what um will give you just strength i think that just

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:05.760
you know just having like a sort of relentless optimism um and i think too that

02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:13.520
um sometimes people assume that suicide is the result of circumstances which maybe in maybe in

02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:18.080
some cases it is but i think one of the things that that book explains well is that very often

02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:24.560
it doesn't have anything to do with circumstances it's just the the pain which book the the darkness

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:30.800
visible um you know because people like to so when somebody commits suicide people will very often

02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:36.000
criticize them like it was a selfish act if they have a family which most people do but especially

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:42.640
if they have kids and i think that um yeah everybody's quick to sort of call the person

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:51.040
who killed themselves selfish and um it's i think that the type of pain that one is experiencing

02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:55.440
that leads to that is something that most people and i don't like people don't understand

02:29:56.240 --> 02:30:00.960
but it's not a selfish thing it's just like quite literally becomes intolerable

02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:05.520
from what i understand and it can hit you it could be slow it could be fast

02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:14.800
yes that pain yes so i think because for me it was more just my circumstances were so

02:30:16.400 --> 02:30:22.640
crappy but also i had an awareness that you know even in reichers i knew how wildly lucky

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:33.600
i was to have you know family a support system you know opportunities and like i'll always be okay

02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:47.440
one way or another um so i felt lucky that i i have that but uh you know also i want you know

02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:53.200
the shame of everything that happened and you know will i ever be able to crawl out from under

02:30:53.200 --> 02:31:00.720
it and rebuild something i don't know um so there were certainly times where um especially when i

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:07.440
would learn something new like reading the emails between mr fox my mother i just wanted a so he

02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:13.840
i wanted like a meteor to hit my particular spot on the earth right then and there just because it

02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:20.880
was he was manipulating your mom too because your mom loved you and was willing to give money

02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:27.520
yeah yeah and it was really grotesque and so and i feel like it's my fault um what's your mom say

02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:34.160
about this whole situation now looking back we don't talk about it as much as one would think

02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:41.360
that we would um because i feel sickening because i feel like it's my fault and i think she also

02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:47.840
feels sick over it and so we don't talk about it as much as one might think sometimes i've

02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:52.480
had to ask questions in the process of writing the book and then there are other things where

02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:56.240
like i could ask the questions but i just don't want to because i don't want to put her through

02:31:56.240 --> 02:32:03.440
that or you know it's not really necessary to ask the questions but there are things that i'm sort

02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:15.520
of curious about um but when you went on that road trip from hell what was what was that like

02:32:15.520 --> 02:32:25.040
where'd you guys go first vegas so you drove from new york where it was a series of stops at like

02:32:25.040 --> 02:32:30.640
hotel motel type places because i did a similar road trip but from boston i drove across the

02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:36.080
united states with no destination i had always wanted to do that and now again i feel like it's

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:40.560
one of those things that sort of like ruined for me because a lot of you can always reclaim it

02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:48.800
yeah i could but now yeah i did think about like how one day if i did some sort of a book tour or

02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:59.200
something that i imagine this leon and i in a car it has to be different than uh uh man book tours

02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:09.200
they if not if you're not careful can suck the soul out of a human being i think you have to do

02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:15.440
like a hunter s thompson style um book tour where you miss a bunch of the dates because you got too

02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:20.960
drunk the night before but anyway or i just what i worry about is that i just would be feeling

02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:29.200
terrible in some way and not be up for it up for the trip or for up for the speaking because for

02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:37.360
like a certain type of appearance i think i'm always afraid of that in um committing to things

02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:43.520
like if it involved going to a big public event yeah i think you have to be very careful like

02:33:43.520 --> 02:33:48.400
podcast is an interesting one i'm always surprised that people just jump on podcasts they haven't

02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:54.960
really listened to and just just do a lot a lot of podcasts that kind of book tour first of all

02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:59.120
financially it doesn't make any sense like especially going on small podcasts like what's

02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:03.600
the benefit like really you want to go on just a couple of big podcasts that you're actually a fan

02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:10.480
of i guess really really really important people don't um like they don't understand the the power

02:34:10.480 --> 02:34:13.920
i mean you maybe you just don't understand podcasting but me as a fan of podcasts

02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:21.520
is like the biggest thing i love listening to is when a guest is a fan they understand

02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:26.880
that the culture the style the sound the feel the end of the podcast they understand the other

02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:32.400
person they feel the pain the hopes of the other person the the the the weird like uh

02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:38.560
quirks of the other person makes for much better listening and ultimately the appearance itself is

02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:43.280
not just enough to sell the book you have to you're selling yourself as a human being and that

02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:49.440
requires having chemistry and all those kinds of things yeah i agree and podcast appearances are

02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:54.320
exhausting like you're giving a lot of yourself it's intimate it's deep like i don't know

02:34:55.440 --> 02:35:02.160
anyway road trip you don't remember the motels and the hotels along the way well there are a

02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:05.600
lot of things where like i'll remember things that happened but i don't remember where it was

02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:13.600
he just drove without a destination really i'm i assume he must have known ahead of time

02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:21.760
but he made it seem like like oh funny we ended up in vegas funny how that happened but it now

02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:26.960
when i see all the places that we stopped they were all places with um where there were casinos

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:33.600
so there's a lot more casinos around the country than i knew um and they're

02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:42.240
uh so so he had a gambling addiction yes yes but i think that it's not it

02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:47.760
so i think that regular people have gambling addictions and it's a horrible tragic thing and

02:35:47.760 --> 02:35:53.280
can destroy their lives and i you know i know people who've like it regular people can have

02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:59.360
a game a gambling addiction which is explained in the way that addictions are explained um for

02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:08.320
him i don't think it was so much an addiction as um like a thrill seeking because he could win money

02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:13.520
lose money and he didn't really care whereas somebody who has an actual addiction and then

02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:21.680
all normal people with normal human emotions you know would either be elated and relieved or

02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:29.360
devastated um to lose a lot of money and for him it didn't really care it was more again i think

02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:33.680
it was more just like a game like what were you what was going through your mind here like would

02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:38.640
you be on the run did you feel like you were on the run no did you know you were on the run

02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:47.600
no so i didn't know that um i mean the thing is the the restaurant was operating and he took me

02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:54.160
away and then like people weren't paid and it all sort of fell apart and you weren't checking your

02:36:54.160 --> 02:37:05.360
texts or any of that no and then he had my phone and my email um i did later on get later on i got

02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:11.040
a brand new phone with like a an empty phone with no existing numbers in it or whatnot

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:19.120
and so that he and i could communicate when i you know i was went to the grocery store or something

02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.080
like that what was the uh what what was the reason he had the phone like what was the narrative the

02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:33.920
story that he he was taking over your phone was it i mean like how how did you allow that to happen

02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:38.560
or maybe a better way to ask us how did he make that happen

02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:46.480
well i was conditioned to it before because before he was always checking my phone which

02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:54.960
was wildly infuriating and i feel like um like you fixed it by giving him the phone

02:37:56.240 --> 02:38:01.200
well i mean the conditions were different later on but in some sense i didn't want my phone because

02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:06.960
everything like i was in a state of shock and it was just like take it fine like i give up like

02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:13.840
i guess i'd given up and and so yeah i'd given up so there was no like i wasn't going to fight back

02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:20.160
on anything um before when he would take my phone and look through it it was it was infuriating

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:27.520
and he sort of forced me to get used to it um and this is again something that like people

02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:30.400
have been in cults would understand because it's like they condition you to not

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:34.880
react negatively to things that you would normally react negatively to

02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:44.080
um and like if i was in a relationship like if somebody i would never ever look in somebody's

02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:53.120
phone and it and if somebody did that to me i would be like goodbye um so i'm pretty sensitive

02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:59.280
about that and um so it was very infuriating when he would take my phone and look at it and

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:06.800
it got to the point where not only did i feel like everything i you know said or wrote or

02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:14.800
emailed digitally or whatnot would be read but he he got me to the point of feeling like i was

02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:23.840
being watched all the time in a non-explainable way yeah what were some of the you didn't mention

02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:28.960
them something the documentary touched on some of them what are some of the fantastical stories

02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:38.320
so he mentioned that he might help make leon immortal immortal what all of that was always

02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:43.040
really vague i mean intentionally like a lot of what he talked about was always very vague

02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:50.000
but a lot of that stuff was very vague and and again like but convincing slowly over time and

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:57.280
a lot of those things too are things that um you know conveniently you kind of can't disprove

02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:02.160
so it's almost like you know people believe in god or religious people believe certain things

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:10.960
um and so one could argue why is it that much crazier for me to have been open to the idea that

02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:17.920
you know maybe leon maybe we do live forever in some way when so a lot of religious people

02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:25.200
have similar beliefs so one of the other thing is he was uh what um maybe you can correct me

02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:28.480
maybe you can correct me but reincarnated or something like that

02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:35.280
or like he acted like he had lived many lifetimes and had all kinds of

02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:45.200
wisdom from having lived all these prior lifetimes and being aware of it so was that

02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:51.120
and it was vague but it was somehow believable or is it just like part of the charm

02:40:51.120 --> 02:41:01.520
um like what how do you how do you not call bullshit i know uh we're not not necessarily

02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:09.040
bullshit i i understand when you're smitten in whatever way but like one a little more details

02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:18.320
proof i suppose it's easy to just you know like um put it off for later

02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:24.800
assume that more details will come later right i think he's a mentalist or an illusionist

02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:32.080
named darren brown and it was on a joe rogan podcast i think joe interviewed darren brown

02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:38.560
um i think sam harris interviewed him i got really intrigued and then i was looking for other

02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:44.880
podcasts or maybe joe interviewed him like right after i may have gone looking for it but anyway

02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:50.000
it was in the it was in the conversation with joe where darren explains um he's somebody i would

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:55.280
love to to meet a mentalist and illusionist because they understand a lot of the ways in

02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:59.680
which the mind can be manipulated so i feel like they would if they looked at everything

02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:05.120
about my situation they would be able to understand better how he was able to get me to

02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:11.200
believe things or go along with things or um because darren brown is pretty fascinating

02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:16.480
what he does and he's really seems like a very kind person and he's very open about it

02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:21.920
and um when he was talking to joe he said this thing that and i use this quote in my book

02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:29.120
and again i'm paraphrasing because i don't have it in front of me but it's like he says something

02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:38.080
about how um we want to believe the lie because we'd rather believe that it's something amazing

02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:45.200
than just that ugly and pathetic a lie and i whatever he said was said in a much better way

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:50.480
but the point is like that's and so he was explaining it in the context of the way that

02:42:50.480 --> 02:42:55.280
an illusionist or whatever they're called is able to to pull off certain things

02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:01.520
which is that they're sort of you know somebody it was about somebody who was watching

02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:08.400
and watch them watch that person um sort of leverage people's tendency to want to believe

02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:13.600
that something amazing and cool is about to happen versus like this is just a really ugly pathetic

02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:20.880
lie so i think that a lot of the things um that that mr fox that that he put forward

02:43:21.680 --> 02:43:27.680
um i couldn't understand it from the perspective of it being a lie because it just seemed too weird

02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:35.520
and crazy so i think that this happens sometimes where um you believe somebody because it seems

02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:42.560
so weird that they would lie about it i think there's somebody has or it's been said sometimes

02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:46.800
that like the more fantastical the lie the more believable it is because you don't you

02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:54.880
don't believe that somebody would tell that lie and i think um something also that mr fox people

02:43:54.880 --> 02:44:00.240
like him are capable of doing is going out and lying in very brazen ways that normal people would

02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:05.760
be terrified to do that kind of also makes it more believable yeah so if somebody could go out on a

02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:15.840
world stage and lie and not kind of feel weird about that or even knowing that it's a lie that

02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:23.360
can be pointed out as being a lie um and then there's also the the the layer of to what extent

02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:28.400
is this person in some way also delusional themselves and sort of believing their lies

02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:32.320
because people have asked me that and i've wondered the same thing to what extent did he believe

02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:39.680
some of the stuff he was saying and i think probably there was some sort of delusional aspect

02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:47.440
almost like he was sort of halfway aware of playing his own sort of virtual reality game

02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:52.560
you know like so he like he was in some kind of metaverse in his brain so you think he believed

02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:58.960
some of the things he was saying in some way yeah what uh he wanted to you know because he wanted

02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:04.960
to be his own like he wanted to be a superhero you know he never built anything or created anything

02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:11.520
or accomplished anything in his life yet you know so so in his own brain if he could turn himself

02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:17.040
into like a movie superhero it's a nice shortcut yeah what about the navy seal thing did that ever

02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:20.880
get resolved you know the

02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:28.400
the lie that he he you know he said that he's a navy seal i don't know if he said he was a navy

02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:34.800
seal or that he implied that he like worked with the cia or then it was like he worked with black

02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:41.680
ops that you know is by definition under the radar right so i mean that's obviously a huge red flag

02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:47.680
now going forward is like if somebody first of all somebody tells you that information pretty

02:45:47.680 --> 02:45:56.000
quickly that's itself a red flag but i mean all right cross i'm you cross that off my list of

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:05.360
pick-up lines um but you know conveniently if he say in some world he actually did work for like

02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:12.640
blackwater one of those places or yeah there i wouldn't be able to just call some place and

02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:22.080
verify it um anyway yeah so i think that in some psychological way that i don't understand he

02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:30.960
probably did in some way halfway exists in this world where he was this um you know like fighter

02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:35.600
and he would say things like it's because of people like me that people like you can sleep

02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:40.000
at night which is probably a line out of a movie that i've never seen i feel like a lot of things

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:46.800
right that's a great that's funny that is a great um who said that that's a that's um is that really

02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:52.400
a line out of a movie it's not a movie it's uh you know what would happen at reichers is

02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:56.800
when these things would happen where one of us couldn't think of something and you're like oh

02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:02.080
who was that actor in that movie and that thing no and so what we'd do is like somebody would be

02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:07.680
on the phone and you'd be like hey who are you talking to can you ask them to look up on their

02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:12.880
phone like so we'd ask people on the phone or somebody would go make a call and you know you'd

02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:17.680
have to call somebody and ask them to google the cast of a movie or something like that i think

02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:22.560
you would find jail don't ever get arrested or try not to but i think you would find jail fascinating

02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:28.720
oh i always wanted to go to jail prison because uh there's a lot of elements to it now i'll ask

02:47:28.720 --> 02:47:34.000
you questions about it but i feel like i can get a lot of reading done i got a ton of reading done

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:39.280
yeah yeah yes i remember now people attribute this to george orwell but they're not sure if george

02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:43.680
orwell ever said it but it's something like there's a lot of different variations

02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:50.080
but we sleep safely at night because rough men stand ready to visit violence on those who would

02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:56.880
harm us and there's a lot of variations of this but basically we depend our entire society depends

02:47:56.880 --> 02:48:04.240
on bad motherfuckers who are willing to fight to protect our freedoms to protect our well-being

02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:10.160
and um one of the things about the united states is because we're surrounded by water we don't get

02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:18.560
to see the violence that's required in part to protect the sovereignty of nations

02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:30.160
you mentioned that i would uh not to go to prison but that i may enjoy my time there let me ask you

02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:34.880
uh not the i mean by the way i love prison movies you would find it fascinating i don't

02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:40.720
because it's like still kind of too soon but well how was your time you spent three and a half

02:48:41.680 --> 02:48:46.640
months at reichers how was that how was your experience in prison

02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:57.360
how's the food from a chef perspective not good but reichers was um when i got to write because

02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:03.760
i so i was arrested i spent i think about 10 days in a tennessee small town tennessee jail

02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:11.280
um oh pigeon forage is also the weirdest place on earth is that a town yes that's the town where

02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:18.000
i was arrested it's why is it so weird um in the film they i told them i told them you have to go

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:22.160
to pigeon forage you have to go there you have to go there and i think i was pushing them because

02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:29.840
it was going to potentially be the end of the season it's like a a summer time or it's a tourist

02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:39.760
destination and it's so bizarre and weird and trippy that um it doesn't even seem real

02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:45.680
seems like a carnival is happening there non-stop exactly it's it's car i think i say that in my

02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:53.360
intro that it's carnivalesque and trippy and weird is there a lot of clowns walking around or

02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:56.800
not necessarily clowns but there is a video on youtube that i

02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:02.640
because i got to the chapter where we arrive in pigeon forage and i'll never forget although i

02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:10.880
have forgotten but i remember being like weirdly like felt like we were had entered a different

02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:16.560
universe driving down this strip and just looking at everything on either side and i'm wishing that

02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:21.200
i could remember in more detail like the names of the places or what was there because i wanted to

02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:27.840
describe it um in this chapter and i was like i wish somebody i wish there was like a video of

02:50:27.840 --> 02:50:31.760
somebody going down the street kind of showing what's on one side and then the other side

02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:36.720
and i was like there probably is and there is on youtube like i found it and i watched the whole

02:50:36.720 --> 02:50:44.320
thing how does this come up from prison exactly um oh okay so that's the town that i went to jail and

02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:51.520
oh right in tennessee right so what was that like the food there and some of the conditions

02:50:53.200 --> 02:50:59.040
the food made when i got to um then i was extradited and transferred to reichers and

02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:05.920
when i got to reichers i felt like it was like the four seasons in comparison wow so um and i

02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:12.400
i really kind of appreciated a lot of things about about new york when i got when i got to reichers

02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:17.520
even though there are a lot of things that are very scary about it where's uh reichers located

02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:24.240
is it close to new york city yes and in a very kind of almost poetically interesting way

02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:30.000
the the dorm room where i was when i was there for the three and a half months was one of the

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:35.280
ones that faced manhattan so i could go across the room and look out the window and see the

02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:46.560
whole manhattan skyline which was i remember being shocked by the cost per prisoner per year

02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:54.640
yes that new york pays it's like 400 500 000 something i didn't think it was that much i

02:51:54.640 --> 02:52:01.200
thought i wrote it down but either way it is no i mean it it elevated uh during covid which is

02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:07.280
fascinating to that the number i just said yeah during covid i felt sick to my stomach thinking

02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:13.200
about people stuck there and again so reichers isn't like a long-term prison it's most of the

02:52:13.200 --> 02:52:20.080
people at reichers are awaiting trial and they've been arrested but not convicted and then if you're

02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:24.320
convicted and you're sentenced to less than a year then you put on a different color uniform

02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:29.920
and you go upstairs to different dorms if you're convicted and sentenced to more than a year you're

02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:35.520
sent to one of the upstate prisons so most of the people at reichers are there in transition

02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:42.800
they've been arrested but not they've been arrested but not convicted or awaiting trial

02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:48.400
so you could be perfectly innocent and you're stuck there and that happens to a lot of people

02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:56.320
or you could be arrested over some kind of comparatively petty thing or non-violent thing

02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:01.520
and and stuck there because you don't have as little as five hundred dollars to pay

02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:11.040
bail which is completely messed up and unjust and i think most people most reasonable people agree

02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:17.760
that it's unjust but it's different when you're there and you see those people and you see um

02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:23.520
kind of the anguish and whether i mean i have no idea if they're guilty of what i mean i'm

02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:28.960
i usually don't know what people are there for what the situation is but you watch the sort of

02:53:30.640 --> 02:53:36.400
help helplessness set in um because you're kind of powerless there you have very little

02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:41.600
contact with the outside world you have these limited phone calls and so for people who had

02:53:41.600 --> 02:53:45.680
kids and a job and an apartment it's like one by one those things are lost or their

02:53:46.240 --> 02:53:52.000
kids are now being looked after by their abusive ex-husband or something like that and so watching

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:59.280
that is just gut-wrenching and then also knowing that the only reason they're unable to get out

02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:04.080
is because of you know a thousand dollars two thousand dollars in some cases five hundred dollars

02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:12.080
there were people um so there's all of these tragic cases but then there was also while i was

02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:16.320
there i mean if i'd had any money i would have been wanting to bail people out left and right

02:54:16.320 --> 02:54:21.440
and then in some cases i think there was a woman there snored really loud and her bail was five

02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:28.480
hundred dollars and i was like i wish i had them i want to bail her she just wanted to bail her out

02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:34.000
so um because i'm pretty sensitive to sounds and being in a room with 50 people inevitably

02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:42.160
so you're in a room with a large number of people yeah there are um there are areas there with cells

02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:50.240
but a lot of the areas there are um rooms with 50 beds so and they're about three feet apart from

02:54:50.240 --> 02:54:57.200
each other so during covid there was certainly no social distancing um and that just felt kind

02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:04.960
of sickening especially because so many of the people are there for non-violent things or drug

02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:13.520
addiction related or mental health issues um how did that you personally just having spent that

02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:22.480
time there for three and a half months how did that change you like what did that have an effect

02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:38.080
on your mind on my mind personally i think i was i was surprised at how well i adapted and then how

02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:43.360
i was able to um and then i think i sort of took it a next level when one of the books somebody

02:55:43.360 --> 02:55:49.520
sent me was um the untethered soul by michael singer and it's very much about like observing

02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:57.600
your mind and um that kind of helped take it a next level so was this like a meditation retreat

02:55:57.600 --> 02:56:04.400
for you well it's like it'd be like trying to meditate in the middle of a circus or yeah

02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:10.000
yeah in crazy circumstances because you're never alone there's nowhere to be alone and there's

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:16.240
always talking there's noises there's fighting noises chaos um did you feel in danger

02:56:18.800 --> 02:56:22.080
yes but um

02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:30.960
i i never i never felt terrified there um you know one of my friends the bathroom is the

02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:36.880
scary place because they don't have cameras in the um in the bathroom so that's sort of a

02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:43.680
one has to watch out there and i did one of my friends who i one of the people i was friends

02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:51.200
with there she did get um beat up a bit in the bathroom one day a lot of weird shit happened

02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:58.800
in the bathroom um but it was for my if you're interested in human behavior and psychology and

02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:04.480
it's it can be fascinating to kind of sit there and watch they were saying like you might enjoy

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:11.920
prison for that perspective like just you get to watch human nature it's um like at the i don't

02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:17.840
want to say that it's worse but like the full variety that it can uh take right and there was

02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:24.240
a lot of beauty there as well i mean was there love people being um well again depends on the

02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:30.640
definition of love but people being you know incredibly generous and kind to each other um

02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:36.000
sometimes people singing at night um

02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:45.280
there was just a lot of and then there was a lot of you know hilarious stuff it's just it's all

02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:53.120
there there's like there's tragic things um you know interesting things a lot of people with

02:57:53.120 --> 02:58:00.800
mental health issues which is um can be difficult to witness so very different experience i should

02:58:00.800 --> 02:58:09.760
ask you this but um somebody that's currently in prison galaine maxwell i believe she spent

02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:19.840
approximately 500 days in isolation so um it's a very different different prison experience

02:58:20.480 --> 02:58:24.080
but what do you think about her case what do you think about her and jeffrey epstein

02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:33.120
she so her brother her family she says that she's a victim

02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:42.000
not the monster i think this is an especially fascinating case because um and i've i have

02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:49.840
listened to podcasts about the you know the epstein situation um and there was one that was

02:58:49.840 --> 02:58:56.720
more focused on her by vicki ward that i would definitely listen to um vicki ward

02:58:58.080 --> 02:59:02.320
is a journalist i think she'd written an article about jeffrey epstein for vanity fair so she got

02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:07.680
to know jeffrey epstein and then she knew galaine maxwell um from being sort of part of the

02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:13.520
uh social circle in which they would have overlapped have you by the way ever met them

02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:23.040
since this new york do you remember meeting this you know uh jeffrey or or galaine no i never met

02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:27.440
them but they're also very much like this sort of upper east side crowd um i did meet harvey

02:59:27.440 --> 02:59:32.560
weinstein once that made me have all kinds of interesting thoughts later at the restaurant

02:59:33.120 --> 02:59:38.640
no it was weird it was out on the street and we had this really strange interaction

02:59:39.440 --> 02:59:46.960
and knowing what i know now it was eerie and and also like had he contacted me after that

02:59:47.920 --> 02:59:52.080
and made it seem like he could have done something for me like would i have been

02:59:53.440 --> 03:00:00.480
you know say he said oh i'm gonna finance your whole expansion or something and like come to my

03:00:00.480 --> 03:00:03.920
you know come meet me at this hotel and then i go to that hotel and then he's like come up to the

03:00:03.920 --> 03:00:08.480
room and then i would have been like uh and you're wondering whether you would have done it

03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:19.840
yes and sadly i think i would have and so i felt a lot of compassion for um those who

03:00:20.720 --> 03:00:28.160
you know didn't yell at him and leave or didn't storm out and because i think what happens in

03:00:28.160 --> 03:00:36.400
those situations is um you know there's all kinds of uncertainty in the moment and you sort of

03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:42.560
freeze and then you'll if i'm probably one of those people that would sit there and somehow in

03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:50.000
the moment without clarity just instinctively feel like somehow i must have done something wrong and

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:57.040
it's my fault and and like i led him on and or just being afraid and then and then you don't

03:00:57.040 --> 03:01:01.680
know how to deal with it and so you freeze um so i think that

03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:08.560
you know if you're somebody that maybe was raised differently or you have

03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:14.560
a lot of self-confidence or um you might have reacted differently and kind of

03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:21.680
pushed him away and stormed out um but i am probably not one of those people

03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:28.560
but i did not ever meet jeffrey epstein but he seems very straightforwardly um you know just a

03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:34.560
classic the way he was able to charm people the way he could step into these roles um

03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:41.200
you know i think he was teaching at dalton and then just kind of the way he would get himself

03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:47.360
into the the academic crowd within harvard and i think also mit right he's sort of

03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:53.040
you know so he's playing a role but he's doing it so well that he fools all these people

03:01:53.600 --> 03:02:00.560
and what and the things that people would in hindsight say about him are just the same things

03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:04.480
that people say about it's like you hear the same things over and over again you hear the same

03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:09.200
things said about those people who were taken in by elizabeth holmes is that they were like

03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:15.920
it was as if he was under a spell it was as if i was under a spell is something you hear a lot

03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:22.240
and so it's like they have this powerful charm that's almost over it's overwhelming in that they

03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:31.360
overwhelm your better judgment or they overwhelm your like normal otherwise normally functioning

03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:37.360
capacity for rational thought and they sort of overwhelm that with their charm so you know when

03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:41.280
you look at i think it was like james mattis invested a bunch of money with elizabeth holmes

03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:47.680
and all these people were involved with her and nobody really did their due diligence where they

03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:53.680
just sort of trusted her and jeffrey epstein i think it's still unclear where he got all of his

03:02:53.680 --> 03:03:02.560
money but the guy wexner less wexner who had you know an enormous amount of money and somehow very

03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:07.680
quickly turned over management of it to jeffrey epstein and so people wonder like why would he

03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:13.680
do that that's insane and and and then other people have commented about that relationship

03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:18.480
like it was as if he was under jeffrey's spell you know observers would say i couldn't understand

03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:24.400
it it was as if he was under his spell and so somebody observing me and mr fox could have

03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:28.480
possibly said the same thing about me but it's a bit different because it wasn't all charm i think

03:03:29.760 --> 03:03:33.520
epstein used his charm and then was probably very very very crafty and

03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:41.520
getting um another thing that people like him do and cults do also is to get um is to get you

03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:48.800
somehow compromised because then they've got you so i think some kind of usually sex related

03:03:49.600 --> 03:03:53.680
yeah and with epstein certainly you know he was known to have cameras everywhere

03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:58.960
and so if he got any of these people on camera doing something compromising and they're an all

03:03:58.960 --> 03:04:05.440
very powerful people then he's got them and i think he was also very smart to do that

03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:12.720
to target people of both parties so that politically that he was able to maintain his power like no

03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:20.560
matter like nobody wanted him to be totally exposed because then people a lot of people

03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:28.320
would be exposed um by the way that part you know that's all kind of conspiracy right

03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:36.080
right we don't know that i so a lot of people believe that and you know i tend to kind of

03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:40.880
naturally believe that because that makes sense but it's also possible that straight up with

03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:47.520
charisma i mean he did record people and there were recordings so i listened to an interview

03:04:47.520 --> 03:04:56.960
with a woman who i mean was a girl back then maybe she was 15 or 16 back then um and subsequently

03:04:57.920 --> 03:05:04.480
years later was able to see some of the video of i mean i think that's a verifiable thing that

03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:10.480
there were video cameras all over his house the degree to which it was used right we don't know

03:05:11.440 --> 03:05:18.160
and um to the degree of how many people were involved and so on there's all kinds of conspiracies

03:05:18.160 --> 03:05:26.560
around the man but the question about her her galane so i only know what i know from the inputs

03:05:26.560 --> 03:05:32.800
which are the vicki ward it was it's a pod it's one of the podcasts it's a narrative podcast so

03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:39.920
it's like a um it's like an audio kind of a documentary or journalistic piece that she did

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:44.240
and put out i thought it was really really well done i think it's called chasing galane

03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:51.360
um and i listened to that whole thing i didn't intend to listen to it all in one stretch i

03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:55.920
thought you know it's good i mean it was like a weekend and i basically was you know cleaning

03:05:55.920 --> 03:05:59.840
and doing other things and walking leon and listening to it and i got through it pretty

03:05:59.840 --> 03:06:07.680
quickly but i got really fascinated by it because um i don't i don't know but i think i feel

03:06:10.480 --> 03:06:17.440
like i find the whole situation gut-wrenching because i think jeffrey epstein is a straight up

03:06:17.440 --> 03:06:28.000
like straight up sociopath like no question with her everybody's calling her evil and

03:06:29.440 --> 03:06:36.000
for her to have enabled and done a lot of the things that she did could potentially require

03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:42.800
um one might say that it could require a lack of empathy to be able to do those things knowingly

03:06:44.800 --> 03:06:48.400
but at the same time i think

03:06:50.640 --> 03:06:56.640
the the information that was conveyed in the vicki ward piece was fascinating to me because

03:06:56.640 --> 03:07:00.960
it's clear that at the very least it's like it's like all these things could be true she could

03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:06.880
these things could be true she could maybe be not enough of a good person to have you know

03:07:06.880 --> 03:07:12.880
horribly victimized these young girls and destroy their lives but she could have i feel like i'm

03:07:12.880 --> 03:07:18.560
gonna get bashed for saying this but she could have in some way of not quite known what she was

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:26.160
doing or been a bit out of her mind like maybe not i'm just saying people i would hope that

03:07:26.160 --> 03:07:32.400
people would be open to that's to exploring that as a possibility well her family and friends are

03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:42.080
making that case they're they're painting a broad picture of who she is as a human being

03:07:42.080 --> 03:07:49.920
and showing that she couldn't have done any of those things without being like systematically

03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:57.520
manipulated that's right what i listened to in that podcast about her relationship with her

03:07:57.520 --> 03:08:06.880
father the how her father died her things about her childhood and then Epstein coming into her

03:08:06.880 --> 03:08:12.720
life and basically kind of pushing all those buttons and becoming like the father figure

03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:16.160
and so she would be in a position of kind of always wanting his approval

03:08:17.040 --> 03:08:23.840
and and just the way that things that are described about the way that she

03:08:25.680 --> 03:08:35.120
um like was so subservient to him in this kind of astonishing way that seems really weird and

03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:41.280
abnormal and yet i think she had a lot of money and connections and i think she lost the money

03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:47.680
but had all the connections either way there was a lot that a ton that Epstein gained via

03:08:48.240 --> 03:08:55.280
his relationship with her like a ton so it makes sense that he would have manipulated her he

03:08:55.280 --> 03:09:01.600
manipulates everybody so he without question i think one could argue he definitely manipulated

03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:08.640
her and again i want to be like careful not to be saying like that's an excuse for what she did

03:09:09.600 --> 03:09:15.760
i just think that that's one possibility it's important to like explore these things and be

03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:20.880
open to them as opposed to just like broad brush painting her as a horrible person i mean

03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:27.040
because people could say that based on things they've read or things that i did that like

03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:31.520
i'm a horrible person and it's very it's very different because what she did involved

03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:39.840
um you know young girls whose lives were destroyed um but i think that

03:09:41.680 --> 03:09:47.920
people could be a bit open to understanding how somebody could be manipulated

03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:56.080
there's a there's a psychologist that i'm friends with um that i got to know after i watched him on

03:09:57.040 --> 03:10:03.920
leah remini's show so leah remini is the actress who was in Scientology got out and has really been

03:10:03.920 --> 03:10:09.600
speaking out about it and trying to expose um what they're all about and how diabolical that

03:10:09.600 --> 03:10:16.720
organization is and a lot of people are exposing them and um you know doing this type of work and

03:10:16.720 --> 03:10:25.280
so she had this guy on her show who was in the moonies and his name is um steve hassen and um

03:10:25.360 --> 03:10:30.560
so he was in a cult and then he got out again by extreme circumstances he got in a car accident

03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:36.240
and almost died and that's what ended up getting him out of the cult that he was in but really

03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:42.400
smart guy um was targeted when he was young got pulled into the moonies but watching this

03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:49.200
interview of him on her show he said he's talking about his experience and he said if they had told

03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:55.600
me to kill somebody i would have and i that in that moment made me cry but i also felt

03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:02.480
like i understand that and not that if mr fox had told me to kill somebody i don't think i would

03:11:02.480 --> 03:11:09.440
have but again i understand how it could get to that point so that makes me feel like with her

03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:16.720
like i would be curious what steve hassen would think kind of analyzing the entire situation

03:11:17.360 --> 03:11:21.040
because it's hard to understand that unless you've been in it and i understand

03:11:21.600 --> 03:11:25.840
with him how he could have said that if they had told me to kill somebody i would have

03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:31.520
that's pretty intense i mean that's pretty extreme and it's interesting how you can get

03:11:31.520 --> 03:11:40.320
into it how far you can go just one day at a time like gradually right just like the frog

03:11:40.320 --> 03:11:44.640
in the boiling water yeah so fascinating i mean all of these cases are fascinating like patty

03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:52.880
hearst that whole story well i'm just also i just uh it's already a while ago reread the rise and

03:11:52.880 --> 03:12:02.240
fall of the third rike i've been reading a lot a lot about hitler and guvin for a long time working

03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:08.320
on a series about hitler and the third rike because it for me it's like returning

03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:16.240
to being so much of my family was destroyed or impacted by this time in history

03:12:17.360 --> 03:12:24.400
that is somehow a way to find out more about myself is going back to that time

03:12:24.400 --> 03:12:26.160
have you ever thought about inherited trauma

03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:27.460
yeah

03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:40.880
this the sounds not to mock people but this sounds like a thing that um like a woke thing

03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:46.960
like like a woke thing yeah i don't mean it that way at all but i get it because sometimes now when

03:12:46.960 --> 03:12:51.520
i say now i almost have to put air quotes when i say something's triggering because i feel like

03:12:51.520 --> 03:12:58.240
i'm using a word that's now like overused or used in less serious so now when i say

03:12:58.240 --> 03:13:04.640
something's triggering it's like i use yeah it's funny because good good words get get

03:13:04.640 --> 03:13:09.520
taken up and then they get people are overusing gas lighting yeah and i worry that that would

03:13:09.520 --> 03:13:13.760
happen with sociopathy like i think people need to understand sociopathy i think it's

03:13:13.760 --> 03:13:18.880
critical for humanity that people understand it yeah so just because you're being an asshole

03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:23.120
doesn't mean exactly and i feel like it's going to be this thing where now everybody's going to

03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:27.680
start calling everybody else a sociopath and it's like you know and right now everybody calls

03:13:27.680 --> 03:13:32.080
everything gas lighting if somebody's lying it's not gas lighting i have to talk we started

03:13:32.080 --> 03:13:38.560
talking about already forgot fluff is it fluff it's fluff right fluff yeah okay so that was

03:13:39.120 --> 03:13:44.000
that was great that's a new discovery for me what um let's talk about food a little bit if you if

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:50.560
we can you know what let's talk about restaurants first what that's a fascinating part of the story

03:13:51.520 --> 03:13:58.320
before anything else which is opening an exceptionally successful restaurant in

03:13:58.320 --> 03:14:05.200
nyc new york city what's that take what does it take to to open up from the very beginning

03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:10.400
from the idea stage to the launching it both the finances and the skill of actually

03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:16.800
getting people super excited by it and then running it all that chaos i mean to me am i

03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:22.720
over romanticizing but it seems like new york city is a really tough place to to to launch a

03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:28.320
restaurant in yes very well i think because it's extremely competitive and the standards are so

03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:36.400
high so i think that's why there are so many good restaurants in new york because if they're not

03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:42.080
good they're not going to survive so even like you could walk into what looks like a hole in the

03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:48.720
wall and it's going to have amazing food that happens a lot so what was the menu so was it a

03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:56.160
raw what was it vegan and raw from the beginning yeah it was a raw means what now i'm getting

03:14:56.160 --> 03:14:59.760
thrown back to all the interviews i did when people ask me these questions it was so long ago

03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:10.480
um at the time like being vegan it um so nothing was cooked over roughly 118 degrees it was this

03:15:10.480 --> 03:15:17.760
very like the world of there were people who are hardcore raw foodists and um and there's also

03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:23.520
people who are hardcore vegans and i was never any of those things so i think what we did you

03:15:23.520 --> 03:15:30.640
weren't the hardcore part or you you weren't but you like what parts of your life were you're a

03:15:30.640 --> 03:15:38.480
vegan are you still a vegan do you eat meat do you are you a vegetarian are you raw good question

03:15:38.480 --> 03:15:44.800
i don't apply labels so none of those labels would apply because it's male and female that's

03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:55.120
i'm beyond those labels myself as well but i'm but i'm uh uh uh carnivore most of the time

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:59.920
there you go it's the opposite of vegan unfortunately but no judgment i think that's

03:15:59.920 --> 03:16:05.600
a beautiful thing to be is vegan likewise i think that it's people who are very adamantly one way

03:16:05.600 --> 03:16:15.040
or the other i think that after all my years in this world and in this world in general

03:16:15.680 --> 03:16:22.800
and also consuming an enormous amount of inputs and podcasts about health like i love listening

03:16:22.800 --> 03:16:26.560
to different points of view so i love when like somebody's arguing vegan and then somebody's

03:16:26.560 --> 03:16:32.000
arguing carnivore and like or even with other issues i like listening to what other people

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:36.960
you know opposing sides assuming they're both you know intelligent interesting sources especially

03:16:36.960 --> 03:16:44.320
when they're i love it when they're sort of really testing that diet meaning they're athletes or

03:16:44.320 --> 03:16:49.120
in some way really testing it not just like vaguely saying what's healthy and not for you

03:16:49.840 --> 03:16:55.040
but like really what is life like under this particular diet yeah and i think that probably

03:16:55.600 --> 03:17:01.120
everybody's different and so in the same way that some people tolerate like some people

03:17:01.120 --> 03:17:06.560
can't tolerate nightshades or some people can't tolerate certain spices or some people can't

03:17:06.560 --> 03:17:14.400
tolerate gluten or some people thrive off of this or that and um i've heard it said and discussed

03:17:14.400 --> 03:17:20.880
that there's a great deal to sort of what your body's used to what your ancestors ate where you

03:17:20.880 --> 03:17:27.200
where because it seems like the human body is pretty adaptable so you can adapt to eating a

03:17:27.200 --> 03:17:35.760
certain type of a food and so that if your you know if your family comes from a certain part

03:17:35.760 --> 03:17:41.200
of the world where certain things aren't grown or or more meat is eaten or because there's people

03:17:41.200 --> 03:17:45.440
who are vegan their entire lives and they're incredibly healthy and they thrive and there's

03:17:45.440 --> 03:17:51.360
athletes and there's people like rich roll who i like who's vegan and an athlete but it might

03:17:51.360 --> 03:17:56.720
be something where that's that's working really well for him but it wouldn't work well for somebody

03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:01.920
else and i think there's also an element of people who try these things and then feel really good

03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:08.640
or feel really bad and they make a conclusion based on that initial period of time when it

03:18:08.640 --> 03:18:13.600
might be something where it makes you feel really good temporarily but then over time you're going

03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:18.880
to be depleted of certain things and then we also live in a world where like our soil is depleted

03:18:18.880 --> 03:18:23.840
and there's a lot of processing that takes out of foods a lot of things that we need so

03:18:23.840 --> 03:18:28.480
um i just think that there's no kind of one right answer you can look at it from just a health

03:18:28.480 --> 03:18:32.720
perspective and then you can also look at it from like a morality and ethics perspective and then

03:18:32.720 --> 03:18:37.120
also like what's the impact on the environment and all those things are important and i think that

03:18:37.120 --> 03:18:43.920
i've watched a lot of films and things and for a while right after that i might think oh my god i

03:18:43.920 --> 03:18:48.880
can't believe i ate this thing last week and now i'm going to go back to being 100 vegan because

03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:53.600
now i'm going to go back to being 100 vegan because i just watched this thing and it's

03:18:53.600 --> 03:18:57.760
fresh in my mind and now i'm thinking about it in a certain way but then over time that sort of

03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:04.880
fades and then you start to get a bit more loose and for me i

03:19:07.440 --> 03:19:14.880
i will end up eating a lot of things that aren't vegan usually in the context where i'm not

03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:23.360
adding to the consumption of it so um like at reichers there was most of the meat there was

03:19:23.360 --> 03:19:30.480
kind of weird and fake but there was like a chicken every thursday and sunday there was um

03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:35.760
it was actual chicken like the leg was that the most exciting thing for people oh yeah oh and

03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:38.960
then the most fights broke out on chicken day because there was like heightened thursday and

03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:45.280
sunday you said yeah chicken day so that was the the most uh real meat you're getting is the

03:19:45.280 --> 03:19:52.080
chicken yeah a lot of breast or dark dark white white or dark meat dark is the the leg and the

03:19:52.080 --> 03:19:59.280
thigh and it was cooked surprisingly well and so i would always eat it i don't know i mean

03:20:00.160 --> 03:20:05.920
yeah it's there and it's not from a health perspective one could say well that's probably

03:20:05.920 --> 03:20:10.160
the shittiest of the shitty chickens that are full of antibiotics and hormones and terrible things

03:20:10.160 --> 03:20:17.040
and so it's not optimal from that point of view um but it's like if it's otherwise going to be

03:20:17.040 --> 03:20:23.040
thrown in the trash then yeah you're not adding to it right or you know like i've been drunk at a

03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:29.200
party and eating a bunch of stuff that one would think i would never eat yeah but it's not like i

03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:33.840
ran to the store and bought it or went to a restaurant and the same liquor makes me eat

03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:41.360
things i shouldn't be eating oh yeah or maybe should well life is as you wrote me in the email

03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:46.640
life is complicated and fascinating and so was our decisions when we're drunk

03:20:47.840 --> 03:20:54.320
i actually am a big fan of 7-eleven i go there sometimes late at night to think about life

03:20:54.320 --> 03:21:00.400
and i'll eat i'll eat whatever the stuff they have i also think it's fascinating how our bodies

03:21:00.400 --> 03:21:06.480
intuitively know what if you're like quiet enough and you think about like what you're craving

03:21:06.480 --> 03:21:12.000
yeah as long as it's not like if you're craving like some processed junkie food that's probably

03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:17.200
something that's not quite functional but if you're like sometimes i'll i'll be like

03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:23.040
i must have avocado or like i'll want to eat an entire parsley salad and then it's happened i

03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:29.200
went through a phase where um and here i'm like do i say this out loud i went through a phase

03:21:29.520 --> 03:21:36.560
are you gonna say it where i was i know now i have to say it um where i couldn't get enough

03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:40.800
um i don't know where it started like whose house i was at or whatever but

03:21:41.520 --> 03:21:46.800
grass-fed butter i just i was like i could tell that my body wanted whatever was there

03:21:46.800 --> 03:21:51.680
yeah and so i suppose i could have investigated it and thought like well what's in there is it

03:21:51.680 --> 03:21:56.160
like vitamin k vitamin d what is it in the grass-fed butter because it wasn't regular but like regular

03:21:56.160 --> 03:22:01.760
butter ew no but like this grass-fed butter like i felt like i just wanted i needed it so there's

03:22:01.760 --> 03:22:05.600
probably something in there and maybe i could have gone and just taken a lot of vitamin k and then

03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:10.880
not eaten the butter but um but there is something in there it's fascinating i had that uh last night

03:22:10.880 --> 03:22:17.600
actually with um i went to grocery grocery store and i had i had a craving for tomatoes i was like

03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:23.360
what the hell is this like what i don't like it was weird should listen to that and then just get

03:22:23.360 --> 03:22:29.440
a bunch of tomatoes because probably something in there it was like it felt right when i was

03:22:29.440 --> 03:22:34.560
little my mother no but that's exactly what i was saying is that somehow your body knows without

03:22:34.560 --> 03:22:40.160
you knowing and today i have zero interest in tomatoes yeah did you eat the tomatoes though

03:22:40.160 --> 03:22:45.920
yeah okay well then you probably i ate way too many but that's all right or maybe not enough

03:22:46.480 --> 03:22:52.320
there you go see what you were saying anyway i think these things like shift and change and

03:22:52.320 --> 03:22:56.800
there's not like a right answer and then there's something where it's like one person might do well

03:22:56.800 --> 03:23:02.960
on something another person doesn't or you might do well on something for like i might you know

03:23:02.960 --> 03:23:07.840
maybe if i ate a bunch of liver i'd feel better because i'm getting a bunch of vitamins that i

03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:13.360
don't that i that i'm lacking but then once i get them i'm fine and i don't need that anymore and

03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:21.520
i could potentially get those from other sources or um but yeah when i was little i used to crave

03:23:21.520 --> 03:23:27.200
my mother said i craved um not craved but she said i would always eat sardines but i wouldn't

03:23:27.200 --> 03:23:32.720
eat the pieces i would only eat the whole ones which have the bones in them and i used to chew

03:23:32.720 --> 03:23:38.640
on chicken bones and try to eat eggshells when i was like a top like little so i think all of

03:23:38.640 --> 03:23:44.480
those things have um calcium and other minerals and commons there's probably something there that

03:23:44.480 --> 03:23:50.640
i needed because you'd think as a little kid i wouldn't be drawn to oily fish and bones and

03:23:50.640 --> 03:23:55.520
eggshells yeah it's interesting because like you're saying the explanation for the cravings

03:23:55.520 --> 03:24:00.400
probably the nutrients you're getting but when you're imagining the craving you're not obviously

03:24:00.400 --> 03:24:06.080
imagining the nutrients you're imagining the texture the taste the feel the i mean a lot of

03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:11.440
things that we actually experience as we're eating that's our brain probably tricking us right but

03:24:11.440 --> 03:24:19.600
do you love tomatoes well um i think we determined that love is impossible to define

03:24:20.160 --> 03:24:25.680
so are you extremely fond of do you think tomatoes are like one of the most delicious foods no no

03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:30.400
but maybe but yet you crave them maybe it's generational uh because it's a big russian

03:24:30.400 --> 03:24:37.440
thing with potatoes and tomatoes and because it's good with with vodka right salted uh we

03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:43.920
were talking about the menu and the early days of the restaurant in new york so what was on the

03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:51.040
menu what was what kind of foods were you playing with do you remember um was that one of the

03:24:51.040 --> 03:24:56.960
challenging things is putting together because you're you're like crafting a new thing in new

03:24:56.960 --> 03:25:02.160
york where it's extremely competitive right well over time it got easier and easier and then also

03:25:02.160 --> 03:25:06.800
i had you know it was i wasn't coming up with new dishes it was the people that worked there so i

03:25:06.800 --> 03:25:14.720
feel like if i could take credit for something it would be recognizing talent and um you know

03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:20.560
and when dishes were developed this is when i was there on my own so it was opened with matthew and

03:25:20.560 --> 03:25:27.840
jeffrey and then um within a year matthew was out um and jeffrey was still involved as like the you

03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:34.480
know the corporate sort of side of it but then over time um i separated from that infrastructure

03:25:34.480 --> 03:25:40.080
as well and then was completely on my own um and in part i i did that because i was growing one

03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:44.720
lucky duck on the side and that was growing and growing and growing and i knew there was something

03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:51.840
there and yet the two businesses were completely intertwined and so um potential investors would

03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:57.440
come at me and they would see this very messy situation where i owned one lucky duck and jeffrey

03:25:57.440 --> 03:26:02.560
charrow owned the restaurant and how do we move forward from there and then people would say i

03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:06.320
should shut down the restaurant and just focus on one lucky duck and i wanted them all to be

03:26:06.320 --> 03:26:11.760
together under one umbrella and to move forward where everybody's incentives were aligned and

03:26:11.760 --> 03:26:18.080
what was the magic why was it so successful so quickly would you say i want to half jokingly but

03:26:18.080 --> 03:26:23.040
not joking but sort of say that it was about the the love and the food and the space

03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:31.280
oh can you define love but it's it's there was something special so i always when people ask

03:26:31.280 --> 03:26:34.000
me about opening a restaurant i say i don't want to get back into the restaurant business

03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:38.560
unless it's the same restaurant in the same space because there was something about that space

03:26:39.280 --> 03:26:48.400
that felt um i guess felt magical for lack of a better word and the energy of a lot of the people

03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:56.720
there and i think that people really cared about it and so for whatever reason it just there was

03:26:56.720 --> 03:27:01.920
an energy about the place would you ever do it again yes you ever consider reopening

03:27:06.800 --> 03:27:11.920
that's a tough thing in new york but you're thinking in okay well it's there it's there

03:27:13.040 --> 03:27:16.960
let me ask you this question because i've been searching for that myself like asking myself

03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:24.400
this question if i you know the last meal question like what's the best meal you've ever eaten in

03:27:24.400 --> 03:27:30.160
your life like if you had if i had to murder you at the end of this and you get one meal but

03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:36.800
you can travel anywhere in the world um what would you what would you eat it's one of those

03:27:36.800 --> 03:27:42.800
questions where i feel like it i should have an answer prepared no it's too it's too difficult

03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:49.920
to sort of pick favorites but if somebody would you know forced you to choose i had i was eating

03:27:49.920 --> 03:27:56.000
something once and i had the thought that if i was gonna die i want this was i would come here

03:27:56.000 --> 03:28:00.400
and order plate after plate of this and eat this do you remember what it was yes some diner in the

03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:07.600
middle of nowhere no it was um pure food and wine was on irving place and then and then the the

03:28:07.600 --> 03:28:12.320
kitchen connected to the one lucky duck juice bar which had an entrance on 17th street so it was

03:28:12.320 --> 03:28:18.000
kind of like this l shape and then there was a huge garden in the back on the corner was casamono

03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:25.040
and bar jamon um which was mario batali and joe bastionich um were behind that and it was very

03:28:25.040 --> 03:28:31.680
focused on meat but also like organ meats and strange unusual spanish restaurant wow lots of

03:28:31.680 --> 03:28:37.600
good reviews yeah it was really good um this is just a funny that we surrounded it but bar jamon

03:28:37.600 --> 03:28:47.600
was um was this tiny little bar and i went in there once with tobin late and i don't know why

03:28:47.600 --> 03:28:54.000
we ended up going there but it was right before they closed and drank red wine and they had tomato

03:28:54.000 --> 03:29:01.440
bread and it's just like a baguette although it's a spanish whatever it's like a bread like a baguette

03:29:01.440 --> 03:29:06.800
like a thin that they toast and i think they rub it with garlic and they don't even put tomato

03:29:06.800 --> 03:29:14.960
slices on it it's like they rub it and the tomato juice is all over it it was just bread and tomato

03:29:14.960 --> 03:29:21.600
juice and probably some garlic flavor and really good salt and some wine and red wine and we sat

03:29:21.600 --> 03:29:26.240
there and ordered a plate ate it ordered another one ate it ordered another one i think we had

03:29:26.240 --> 03:29:31.520
like six plates and i remember sitting there thinking i could just eat this until my stomach

03:29:31.520 --> 03:29:37.840
bursts and then and so if this is like if somebody was like what's the last i would just want to sit

03:29:37.840 --> 03:29:41.920
there and eat plate after plate i think if you went back there and ate the same thing it wouldn't

03:29:41.920 --> 03:29:49.120
taste nearly as good like was there something magical about that night about the way that

03:29:49.120 --> 03:29:57.520
bread was made on that night the way you felt at that night the wine the something or do you think

03:29:58.160 --> 03:30:03.920
like where's the power from that food come from is it the food itself or is it the environment

03:30:04.720 --> 03:30:10.480
i'm sure it's both but like if somebody brought a plate of it here right now it would be completely

03:30:10.480 --> 03:30:18.400
delicious yeah but it might not feel as kind of not that it felt magical but it was the whole

03:30:19.600 --> 03:30:24.800
warmth of the experience and and the red wine and the afternoon in texas right now so it's

03:30:24.800 --> 03:30:30.240
different and if i keep forgetting and thinking it's late at night yeah we're surrounded by

03:30:30.880 --> 03:30:38.000
this is this whole place is anti-huberman there's no light um well it's it's pro-huberman if it's

03:30:38.000 --> 03:30:43.040
in the afternoon or the evening except for these bright lights if they were lower down

03:30:43.600 --> 03:30:48.160
if they were like down below then they're hitting the tops of our eyes but it's the light coming

03:30:48.160 --> 03:30:53.120
from above that's destructive at night because it's hitting the bottom of your eyes so it's like

03:30:53.120 --> 03:30:59.280
mimicking the sun which is signaling your body that it's time to be awake so as much as possible

03:30:59.280 --> 03:31:03.760
so i do this in the evenings i shut off all the overhead lights i try to dim the lights as much

03:31:03.760 --> 03:31:09.760
as i can and and i turn on like a lamp versus an overhead light are you also doing the caffeine

03:31:09.760 --> 03:31:16.080
thing like not not consuming much caffeine way before bed oh i can't yeah i usually

03:31:16.960 --> 03:31:23.760
don't have caffeine late i try not to have it so ideally i drink into the night

03:31:23.760 --> 03:31:29.200
caffeine 2 p.m would be my last i wouldn't ideally i wouldn't drink coffee after two but plenty of

03:31:29.200 --> 03:31:34.560
times i do especially if i haven't had midday coffee then i worry i'm gonna get a headache

03:31:34.560 --> 03:31:37.840
that makes you way more responsible than me let me return to love

03:31:40.560 --> 03:31:44.080
what do you think makes for a good romantic relationship

03:31:47.120 --> 03:31:48.240
given your experience

03:31:52.240 --> 03:31:55.840
i mean this question i think a mutual respect is a big part of it

03:31:56.800 --> 03:32:04.080
mutual respect that's interesting well and understanding it in a way that you want what's

03:32:04.080 --> 03:32:09.280
best for the other person not in a way that you would sacrifice yourself for them necessarily

03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:16.480
but in a very healthy way so i think a healthy relationship is where you know you want what's

03:32:16.480 --> 03:32:25.120
best for the other person so i always find it tragic like say you started dating somebody

03:32:25.120 --> 03:32:30.160
who then would get jealous or upset if you spent too much time working on something

03:32:31.280 --> 03:32:36.720
right and but but that's like your life so if you're working on some robotics thing and you're

03:32:36.720 --> 03:32:41.360
having some breakthrough and so you just want to spend a lot of time wherever you spend a lot of

03:32:41.360 --> 03:32:46.000
time doing those things and then that other person got all bent out of shape and it became like a

03:32:46.000 --> 03:32:54.080
competition that to me seems very unhealthy because if somebody if it was if it was like a genuine

03:32:54.880 --> 03:33:03.920
healthy love she would want you to be doing those things yeah that's a good observation but

03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:08.320
to me i think the way to achieve that

03:33:11.440 --> 03:33:14.640
is actually or the easiest way to achieve that at least for me

03:33:14.640 --> 03:33:19.520
is actually legitimately be excited by the things the other person is excited by

03:33:20.320 --> 03:33:25.760
so like not in some generic sense it's good for them to be doing the robotics thing

03:33:26.400 --> 03:33:31.840
like it's more like you become a fan of all the cool things that they're doing in their life so

03:33:31.840 --> 03:33:37.680
like i definitely have this and somebody told me recently there's a term for this but i love

03:33:37.680 --> 03:33:46.800
like watching other people like um succeed be excited about shit

03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:52.800
just like i like celebrating other people like it's fun for me to watch people do the thing they

03:33:52.800 --> 03:34:00.160
love doing so like i you know in some sense that's reinvigorating to me and exciting to me and so

03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:05.920
one one of the things for me in a relationship is like you get excited by watching another person

03:34:05.920 --> 03:34:10.480
do the thing they're excited about it's not like i intellectually know it's good for them to have

03:34:10.480 --> 03:34:16.960
their own thing and they you know it's like i legit get excited by their own thing because

03:34:16.960 --> 03:34:21.760
otherwise that's what i mean it's like that person would be excited because you're excited

03:34:22.800 --> 03:34:28.320
and but they would i think the easiest way to achieve that is actually be like what am i trying

03:34:28.320 --> 03:34:34.240
to say it's like it's not like saying that you should be excited it's like you can't help yourself

03:34:34.240 --> 03:34:40.080
but be excited right right but i think that's possible but it's possible for that to be the

03:34:40.080 --> 03:34:48.880
case for somebody that like might have an appreciation for what you're doing but isn't

03:34:48.880 --> 03:34:53.120
like that's not what that person's going to go spend their time on themselves yeah they

03:34:53.120 --> 03:34:58.560
were by themselves right so they might the other person might you know be really good at a musical

03:34:58.560 --> 03:35:02.080
instrument that requires a lot of practice and you're not interested in playing that musical

03:35:02.160 --> 03:35:06.640
instrument but you appreciate the beauty of the music and understand that that person is getting

03:35:06.640 --> 03:35:11.440
something out of it so you would be excited when they get a chance to practice or or whatnot you

03:35:11.440 --> 03:35:18.240
know so it's that kind of a do you think loves should be simple or complicated in a relationship

03:35:19.040 --> 03:35:25.120
well it might be inherently complicated i think i may have asked huberman the exact same question

03:35:26.240 --> 03:35:30.640
forget what he said i thought it was interesting when you asked elon about love

03:35:30.640 --> 03:35:37.520
oh boy yeah he that that's a that's that's that's going to be conversation number like

03:35:37.520 --> 03:35:44.320
seven that he actually answers it well what was interesting that i found admirable was this sort

03:35:44.320 --> 03:35:52.240
of like a duty to humanity i think you asked about it not in about person but about the work

03:35:53.200 --> 03:36:00.160
and so it was like it was like a to do to put all this energy to try to kind of like move things

03:36:00.160 --> 03:36:06.000
forward knowing that he will probably die before it gets there you're talking about like a something

03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:15.600
related to the science of rocketry yeah he's kind of a rocket scientist but whatever you were asking

03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:19.680
him about whether something could be accomplished and he said yes but not in his lifetime but he's

03:36:20.160 --> 03:36:23.280
going to keep pushing it forward anyway so i felt like that was a really

03:36:25.120 --> 03:36:30.720
you know to put so much of yourself into something just to kind of move the baton forward for

03:36:30.720 --> 03:36:38.400
humanity it was a struck me as an admirable thing you know where there's no great reward

03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:43.520
in terms of you're going to you know you're going to see that invention happen or you're going to see

03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:49.600
mars colonized or whatever it is but you'll you'll you're willing to put in all the work

03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:54.960
and brain power to try to push it along like thinking about the biggest possible impact on

03:36:54.960 --> 03:37:00.560
the world just thinking about humanity i think all of us when we do cool things are contributing to

03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:06.000
humanity and it's it's good to think of it that way when you run a restaurant and you make all

03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:13.440
the people happy i don't know that's part of that it's good to think big like that and ilan does

03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:19.920
definitely but when i asked him about love i'm you know just knowing him personally now

03:37:20.960 --> 03:37:27.280
i'm asking about the personal question about love but i'm giving him the freedom to escape it which

03:37:27.280 --> 03:37:34.240
he he always does that's very generous because i don't want to trap him and i understand it's

03:37:34.240 --> 03:37:39.280
it's a difficult so you know he's better at solving engineering problems than talking about love

03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:47.600
the other thing he's really good at is um going to the joke so for him um you know

03:37:50.800 --> 03:37:56.000
for him love and all those kinds of things especially those kind of cliche sounding things

03:37:56.800 --> 03:38:02.720
um are are the stuff of memes it's the stuff the easiest way you can talk about it is humor

03:38:02.720 --> 03:38:06.880
the same with trauma like personal trauma easiest stuff for him to talk about is the

03:38:06.880 --> 03:38:15.680
is take his laugh about it he's he's been very tough privately or on podcast to talk about

03:38:15.680 --> 03:38:21.120
personal like difficult stuff and for me obviously that's often the most interesting stuff

03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:28.880
as humans like where's your darkness you know but uh for him it's tough for a lot of people

03:38:28.880 --> 03:38:34.240
it's tough but it's important to go there maybe maybe first in the privacy of your mind

03:38:35.200 --> 03:38:39.440
and i think you know bringing it back to the relationship thing is wanting to um

03:38:41.280 --> 03:38:46.880
like understand and accept those things about somebody else i mean sort of cliche to say that

03:38:46.880 --> 03:38:55.280
you can't change somebody um and you don't want to also like try to change yourself for somebody

03:38:55.280 --> 03:39:01.920
but you can sort of figure things out and be willing to make adjustments and navigate for the

03:39:02.320 --> 03:39:10.160
sake of something working and sometimes that comes from understanding which might require

03:39:10.160 --> 03:39:15.920
a lot of effort and yeah open-mindedness if somebody's kind of very different from you

03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:22.800
yeah and being uh being fragile yourself revealing your flaws and getting to learn

03:39:22.800 --> 03:39:27.760
about theirs and getting to see the beauty in them because that's the good stuff

03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:33.360
or if if if the flaws are too much of a red flag then you walk away that's the hard stuff

03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:38.960
you either the red flags might be the thing that you actually get to love deeply because

03:39:38.960 --> 03:39:44.000
they're a flawed human or it might be the reason to walk away quickly and you don't know

03:39:45.040 --> 03:39:50.880
it's it's a gamble if it's a red flag then it by definition is something that's telling you to

03:39:50.880 --> 03:39:56.880
walk away if it was just like something about their character that's challenging you could

03:39:57.920 --> 03:40:05.200
appreciate that or understand it but it's not something that like they're intentionally trying

03:40:05.200 --> 03:40:12.080
to use to deceive you i think red flags it's like i guess it's more about like manipulation

03:40:12.080 --> 03:40:17.520
and or like somebody's kind of extreme dysfunction or something would be red flags but i think there

03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:26.640
could be things that are quirky or weird or even dark about somebody um that are acceptable yeah

03:40:26.640 --> 03:40:33.120
but they might look like red flags if if they're if there's a if there's someone crying on the

03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:38.800
subway that's a red flag for me that she might be like an emotional basket yeah this is a crazy

03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:44.960
person yeah yeah that's true but you know it could also be there could be a deeper story to it so

03:40:45.680 --> 03:40:50.800
uh that's what i'm trying to tell you that's true all right what advice would you give

03:40:51.760 --> 03:40:55.840
to young folks today if they want to launch a restaurant in new york city

03:40:56.560 --> 03:41:01.520
and then message somebody on twitter i was before you finished the sentence i was about to say read

03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:07.440
a lot of books but then you then because you said what advice would you give to young people today

03:41:07.440 --> 03:41:13.600
and i was like read a lot of books yeah and then you got to the restaurant part yeah no no i mean

03:41:13.600 --> 03:41:19.840
that's i was joking about the restaurants yeah about life i would say uh not just about career

03:41:19.840 --> 03:41:28.080
as a restaurant tour but just in life how to be successful how to be how to live a life that can

03:41:28.080 --> 03:41:34.080
be fulfilling and how to live a life that can be proud of to read a lot of books it's complicated

03:41:34.080 --> 03:41:40.240
because have you figured it out yet no but i think self-awareness is key but i also think

03:41:41.520 --> 03:41:46.560
there's some of those things where like people kind of have to learn their own lessons but

03:41:47.200 --> 03:41:52.720
i think in part because i never had kids and i never wanted kids i feel like through my book

03:41:52.720 --> 03:42:00.960
i keep thinking that i want a lot of the lessons that i learned to be um useful to other people

03:42:00.960 --> 03:42:09.680
particularly younger people um and in many cases younger females um to maybe understand themselves

03:42:09.680 --> 03:42:14.160
a little better along the way because i think that you know a lot of mistakes that i made and

03:42:14.160 --> 03:42:18.640
a lot of mistakes that i made and things that happened or things that i did that i'm embarrassed

03:42:18.640 --> 03:42:25.760
about um or things that i stepped into that i wouldn't have otherwise stepped into or allowed

03:42:25.760 --> 03:42:36.960
to happen were a result of in many cases like insecurity um like a lack of confidence and um

03:42:36.960 --> 03:42:45.520
um and i think in the context of moving forward with relationships being really careful to

03:42:45.520 --> 03:42:49.760
understand why you're there or if you're repeating a pattern that's something that

03:42:50.560 --> 03:42:57.360
is sort of cliche but i feel like it's very i mean aren't cliches are things that are true

03:42:57.360 --> 03:43:03.200
they're just repeated a lot but they're but anyway the idea that people repeat patterns

03:43:03.200 --> 03:43:11.360
right so i think that's very true right and so to be aware of that and to figure it out sooner

03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:17.600
rather than later so you don't keep stepping into the same thing over and over again you mentioned

03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:24.800
sort of giving yourself time and space to think yeah which sometimes isn't possible but don't let

03:43:24.800 --> 03:43:31.600
momentum of life sort of carry you away right and i think for me one of the things that would have

03:43:31.600 --> 03:43:38.560
scared me about having kids is the chaos of it um or not being able to handle it but i think

03:43:38.560 --> 03:43:46.160
that's like that's just me not most people you ran a restaurant i know but just probably why i would

03:43:46.160 --> 03:43:54.560
go home at night and lie on the floor and cry or often do you do that um what's do you like a good

03:43:54.560 --> 03:44:03.920
cry i do music usually or what's can you paint a scene what and just in general yes there are

03:44:03.920 --> 03:44:10.880
candles i cried this morning okay not intentionally not happiness or just overwhelmed it was like a

03:44:12.240 --> 03:44:20.320
you know i i looked a little bit at instagram and saw what was it very often they're like

03:44:21.200 --> 03:44:24.880
like these little animal rescue stories or whatever but this is a this guy matt who used

03:44:24.880 --> 03:44:31.040
to be my trainer years ago and put this little montage video to music that was interesting if

03:44:31.040 --> 03:44:36.080
there hadn't been music i probably wouldn't have cried but it was um showing his wife having their

03:44:36.080 --> 03:44:42.560
second child not not showing it but like the sort of before and then you know the baby in her arms

03:44:42.560 --> 03:44:47.920
right afterwards and then bringing the baby home it was this very short little clip but set to music

03:44:48.560 --> 03:44:54.480
and i watched that and started to cry but like it's not i didn't sob or anything so

03:44:55.360 --> 03:45:04.960
i think i cry easily um interestingly though in actual horrifically tragic things

03:45:05.680 --> 03:45:10.560
or when they apply to me i might not cry and then people find that unusual and that was in the film

03:45:10.560 --> 03:45:15.280
that i don't know if it was my sister or my father described that when my parents got divorced i

03:45:15.920 --> 03:45:21.200
didn't cry and i just whereas my sister bawled her eyes out and i didn't cry at all ever and i

03:45:21.200 --> 03:45:28.880
just didn't say anything i want to talk about it um and um you know like when i was sentenced to

03:45:28.880 --> 03:45:36.720
jail i didn't cry um so a lot of times when something really big happens i get a little

03:45:36.720 --> 03:45:48.000
bit weirdly um i don't know but i very often too much to feel it all directly so you kind of cry

03:45:48.000 --> 03:45:54.720
it out later slowly right maybe years later maybe years later yeah maybe that's what i'm really

03:45:54.720 --> 03:45:59.280
crying about when i cry at these little videos or something yeah i don't know but i'm glad for it

03:45:59.280 --> 03:46:06.080
because i feel like it always feels like kind of a relief well let me ask this because it's interesting

03:46:06.080 --> 03:46:09.440
what you would say do you have regrets

03:46:11.920 --> 03:46:18.000
about things in your life like what do you regret if there's a one day you could live

03:46:19.360 --> 03:46:25.680
again or which day would you pick like relive and make different choices

03:46:27.520 --> 03:46:33.840
um well like one obvious thing could be the day that i let anthony strange is in the door if i

03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:40.560
instead you know if at any time early on i instead just pushed him out you know that

03:46:40.560 --> 03:46:47.280
my life would be wildly different um it's hard to so that's the biggest mistake of your life

03:46:47.280 --> 03:46:54.960
you would say just letting anthony to your life i think yes i think one could argue that's the

03:46:54.960 --> 03:47:02.960
biggest mistake but then at the same time you never know because like when i um i was in a

03:47:02.960 --> 03:47:08.880
sort of a dark relationship that then led to the restaurant am i having the one lucky duck brand

03:47:09.440 --> 03:47:16.320
so i felt like that darkness it's like if you married a horribly abusive person but you had

03:47:16.320 --> 03:47:20.160
a beautiful child and then you go on and you have this beautiful child and you think well if i hadn't

03:47:20.160 --> 03:47:24.720
been with that horribly abusive person i wouldn't have this beautiful child so i wouldn't go undo it

03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:29.760
so i feel like a lot of things are like that and i guess i could optimistically hope that

03:47:30.480 --> 03:47:36.800
there are good things down the road where i'll think well i'm here and i'm appreciate i'm grateful

03:47:36.800 --> 03:47:40.720
for it and therefore i'm grateful for the things that got me here which include a lot of dark

03:47:40.720 --> 03:47:46.800
things it's hard to say because a lot of people were hurt in my case but i am optimistic that i

03:47:46.800 --> 03:47:54.080
can make those things up and they're also hurts that were um i mean in some cases emotionally

03:47:54.080 --> 03:48:01.920
but also very much financial and i feel like those are numbers and the employees were all

03:48:01.920 --> 03:48:07.440
paid back so anybody else that is out money because of everything that happened isn't somebody that's

03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:14.960
like not able to um you know feed themselves everybody most of those people have plenty of

03:48:14.960 --> 03:48:21.200
money and it's like not a big deal but i still want to repay all of it um and it's numbers it's not

03:48:21.920 --> 03:48:28.240
um you know like nobody died and sometimes when i think about my own challenges

03:48:29.600 --> 03:48:35.920
um they feel sort of inconsequential in comparison to other things going on in the world so

03:48:38.480 --> 03:48:44.640
um you know like yes it's hard being humiliated or it's hard to have people say nasty things

03:48:44.640 --> 03:48:50.240
about you on twitter instagram but really who cares because that's just words and things and

03:48:50.240 --> 03:48:59.200
i'm not like fleeing my home and watching people get shot so and they're still out of this darkness

03:48:59.200 --> 03:49:05.120
or out of this you can still that you still have a lot of time to create something beautiful

03:49:05.120 --> 03:49:10.080
in the world yeah maybe something even more beautiful than you've ever done before

03:49:10.080 --> 03:49:16.480
i am optimistic and i also feel like you know part of the reason i like having these conversations

03:49:16.480 --> 03:49:23.040
because i feel like people will learn stuff from my shitty experiences to avoid

03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:29.200
going through their own shitty experience and i've heard a ton of that from a lot of women and some

03:49:29.200 --> 03:49:35.280
men um you know writing to me saying that they went through something similar and nobody understood

03:49:35.280 --> 03:49:43.040
and you know my story helped them or um you know might help them get somebody else out of a situation

03:49:43.920 --> 03:49:49.760
so making it useful feels good so through all of this leon was with you

03:49:51.520 --> 03:49:58.080
he uh recently had a birthday march i guess yes 12 yeah i made him a phenomenal

03:49:59.200 --> 03:50:07.920
meat cake or a layered cake that involved a variety of animal foods he's not a vegetarian

03:50:07.920 --> 03:50:13.920
no he's not but i also give him like really high quality stuff but yeah he's not a vegan

03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:19.200
a vegetarian let me ask you a hard question do you think about the tragic fact that dogs

03:50:19.200 --> 03:50:28.160
live much shorter lives than us humans do you think about his mortality all the time i kind

03:50:28.160 --> 03:50:34.320
of try not to but all the time because you told me in traveling here to austin texas

03:50:35.280 --> 03:50:42.880
you're not in the habit of leaving leon by himself uh well he's not by himself but i

03:50:42.880 --> 03:50:51.360
know i haven't been away from him in certainly since before covid um

03:50:53.360 --> 03:51:00.800
so give him that so i'm not used to it and so i people always say that dogs have um like that

03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:04.080
dogs have attachment issues or get separation anxiety but

03:51:04.800 --> 03:51:10.960
in my case at least it's like i think he's fine i'm the one that is you know he's like fine i'm

03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:17.360
the one that gets anxious about it um being away from him you're the one who acts like a dog when

03:51:17.360 --> 03:51:23.440
you you come back and you're super excited to see him yeah be on the floor and wiggle your tail and

03:51:23.440 --> 03:51:28.800
drool and all that kind of stuff but do you think about the fact you know that you might lose leon

03:51:28.800 --> 03:51:34.080
soon i do i think about it all i mean i i try not to think about it but are you scared of it

03:51:34.080 --> 03:51:40.720
and i um yeah it's scary but then i also just try to understand that it's inevitable and um i mean

03:51:41.600 --> 03:51:49.440
yeah assuming i'm still around then um that's i think one of the things about

03:51:50.400 --> 03:51:56.480
having adopting a dog or getting or caring for an animal unless it's one of those animals that

03:51:56.480 --> 03:52:02.800
lives a really long time i i just found out that parrots live an extraordinarily long time yeah

03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:09.760
but they're annoying so you get it's a trade-off the ones we love live a short time the ones that

03:52:09.760 --> 03:52:16.560
avoid you right live a long time so i just think it's one of those things that you just know what's

03:52:16.560 --> 03:52:21.360
going to happen and it's just part of life and i think it's one of those pains that's

03:52:21.360 --> 03:52:28.320
it's painful but you just kind of have to go through it um and what's the alternative you're

03:52:28.320 --> 03:52:33.040
not gonna it's like saying you would never want to fall in love because of the heartbreak that's

03:52:33.040 --> 03:52:39.520
gonna inevitably come yeah so some people do that they just avoid ever you're saying screw it i'm

03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:45.680
diving right in yes it was all worth it what about your own mortality you think about yourself dying

03:52:45.680 --> 03:52:52.240
less so than i was before um i think i wrote about that and i put this letter

03:52:52.240 --> 03:52:58.960
dear mr fox online which i never intended to do but i did because of all the misconceptions about

03:52:58.960 --> 03:53:02.720
the film and our and our relationship and so i put this thing up online that i'd written

03:53:03.520 --> 03:53:10.080
on my phone on multiple subway rides and at the end of it i talk about because especially then

03:53:10.080 --> 03:53:16.000
when like it was the height of everything was gone and you know what do i have to live for i

03:53:16.000 --> 03:53:21.520
sort of noticed and wrote about how differently i felt about things whereas i used to be afraid

03:53:22.400 --> 03:53:26.240
i used to have like a healthy fear of you know being pushed in front of a train because that

03:53:26.240 --> 03:53:34.560
happens you know in new york or anywhere or you know i had a healthy fear of like i don't know

03:53:34.640 --> 03:53:38.320
walking down a dark street at night but i noticed that at the time

03:53:39.200 --> 03:53:43.680
i didn't really have those fears because i was like what do i like what do i have to lose like

03:53:43.680 --> 03:53:50.240
who cares you know i'm i don't have anything anymore what do i have to lose so i i certainly

03:53:50.240 --> 03:53:58.400
feel much less that way but something about those feelings lingered where i'm less afraid of it

03:53:59.360 --> 03:54:04.640
or more just less afraid of it but hoping it's not some sort of a gruesome way

03:54:05.280 --> 03:54:09.920
i mean some people are really afraid of flying and i feel like well statistically it's extremely

03:54:09.920 --> 03:54:15.200
safe and if it's going to happen it's going to happen there's nothing you can do like there's

03:54:15.200 --> 03:54:20.480
really nothing you can do unless you're going to like do what that guy in that small plane did

03:54:20.480 --> 03:54:24.000
the other day and like leap over and was able to take control of the plane but i mean like a

03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:27.760
commercial flight so it's like if you're going to die you're going to die and it's just your

03:54:28.400 --> 03:54:34.480
time and all you can do is hope that i would i would probably prefer to have as little

03:54:34.480 --> 03:54:38.640
awareness about it as possible you know it's like if you'd rather have somebody

03:54:40.080 --> 03:54:43.360
if you're going to get shot you'd rather have somebody shoot you in the back of the head and

03:54:43.360 --> 03:54:48.880
you didn't see it coming and just boom lights out versus somebody holding a gun to your head

03:54:48.880 --> 03:54:53.840
and then you're going to feel all this fear and have to like feel all of that

03:54:54.800 --> 03:54:56.000
which also made me think of

03:54:58.240 --> 03:55:02.800
you know animals and animal suffering in the way that some people argue that

03:55:04.400 --> 03:55:06.960
because of the conditions and the fear that that's like

03:55:08.960 --> 03:55:13.120
that's like in their bodies when they're killed which is an interesting thing to think about

03:55:15.840 --> 03:55:19.280
yeah i clearly struggle with the ethics of

03:55:19.440 --> 03:55:25.680
of i just i think about it a lot about

03:55:30.080 --> 03:55:37.040
you know like our current food system which involves a system that everybody

03:55:37.040 --> 03:55:40.000
has sort of accepted and normalized where

03:55:40.960 --> 03:55:49.920
um like say aliens did come down yeah and looked at us and realized that we're a particularly good

03:55:49.920 --> 03:55:57.920
source of whatever fuel they need so then they imprisoned us all in cages that were like the

03:55:57.920 --> 03:56:06.400
equivalent of like sardines and jammed in an elevator and then we were bred and we would get

03:56:07.360 --> 03:56:13.760
sick and we'd go crazy and we'd do the equivalent of like pecking and then we'd get abused

03:56:13.760 --> 03:56:20.160
and then like grotesquely and brutally killed and that was like our entire lives and so

03:56:20.800 --> 03:56:27.440
if like aliens came down and started and did all of that we would have to be okay with that

03:56:28.880 --> 03:56:35.920
which is something that my um was said to me after watching this movie called our daily bread many

03:56:36.000 --> 03:56:40.400
years ago um but it's an interesting way to think about it because

03:56:42.640 --> 03:56:46.080
i mean we would have to be okay with it because that's kind of what we're doing now

03:56:47.040 --> 03:56:52.720
right yeah we've normalized certain kinds of cruelty and i don't people think yeah people

03:56:52.720 --> 03:57:00.560
think that like i would object to hunting hunting for sport i think is grotesque but if you're

03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:06.880
hunting and then you're going to eat the entire animal and you're hunting in a way where it's

03:57:06.880 --> 03:57:13.200
kind of like you know that that animal like lived a free and happy life until that moment in the

03:57:13.200 --> 03:57:19.760
same way that the animal lived a free and happy moment lived a free and happy life or we don't

03:57:19.760 --> 03:57:26.240
know maybe they were depressed but they lived a free life until like the lion came and took it down

03:57:26.960 --> 03:57:34.800
so is a human shooting an animal for food somehow more tragic or horrible than a lion attacking

03:57:35.760 --> 03:57:42.160
an elk yeah well so there's a lot of complexities to it on top of all of that so one you said

03:57:42.720 --> 03:57:48.560
sort of hunting for sport is bad but there's this like complex ethical equation of the fact that

03:57:48.560 --> 03:57:54.000
hunting for sport is the thing that often funds the preservation of a species that's well no

03:57:54.640 --> 03:58:01.040
that's another complicated layer there's like the maui venison all the deer in hawaii and

03:58:02.880 --> 03:58:10.720
i might have gotten maui venison treats for leon but they're they're hunting those deer

03:58:12.800 --> 03:58:17.680
is a way of preserving the yeah so i mean these things are complicated but that's why i don't

03:58:17.680 --> 03:58:25.760
have a problem with somebody shooting an elk or bringing it home and eating it like my um you

03:58:25.760 --> 03:58:30.080
know like i've eaten elk jerky and things like that from that's one of those situations where

03:58:30.080 --> 03:58:36.320
like i wouldn't morally have a problem with it and for me it's also i'm not one of those people

03:58:36.320 --> 03:58:42.720
where i think like ew i wouldn't eat meat it's more like i don't want to add to the consumption

03:58:42.720 --> 03:58:49.840
of it and i wouldn't want to eat sort of like the factory farmed meat necessarily unless i'm

03:58:49.840 --> 03:58:57.840
in prison and it's otherwise going to get thrown away but hashtag a lot of a lot of things happen

03:58:57.840 --> 03:59:04.560
you know you know you make do things differently there but yeah um so you know it's just these

03:59:04.560 --> 03:59:08.960
things are complicated but so it's not about like you know i don't want that in my body it's sort

03:59:08.960 --> 03:59:15.760
of like what where did it come from and and what's going on here and um i think that

03:59:17.520 --> 03:59:24.000
like if you just followed joe rogan's instagram there's sort of a bit of a glorification of meat

03:59:24.000 --> 03:59:33.120
that because i listened to enough that i heard the one where he talked there was a recent one

03:59:33.120 --> 03:59:37.920
where he's talking about anthony bourdain and in that conversation i think it was that one

03:59:37.920 --> 03:59:42.880
he explained that he sort of did it in summary so i feel like he talked about it in the past but

03:59:42.880 --> 03:59:48.720
did all this research and came to the conclusion based on all his research came to the conclusion

03:59:48.720 --> 03:59:56.560
that he was either going to be vegetarian or shoot his own meat yeah and hunt and so that

03:59:56.560 --> 04:00:02.560
that's totally different that's something i mean that's very like admirable i think and he has the

04:00:02.560 --> 04:00:09.200
means to do it but but if you not only that it does it with a bow right even more so so it is a

04:00:09.200 --> 04:00:16.800
good question it's it's a good question how we uh get out of this factory right because i because

04:00:16.800 --> 04:00:23.760
i do like i i like i like meat i think it's delicious i i we're dependent on the not just

04:00:25.200 --> 04:00:31.040
on the the nutrients and the taste we're also dependent on the cost a lot of people have gotten

04:00:31.040 --> 04:00:37.040
used to a particular kind of cost that they pay for meat right but i think if you wiped out all

04:00:37.040 --> 04:00:42.640
the government subsidies it would be a completely different story because why why are vegetables so

04:00:42.640 --> 04:00:50.160
expensive and all the subsidies some tomatoes yesterday i'm i'm protesting why is salad so

04:00:50.160 --> 04:00:58.960
expensive right but none of the the if you if you look at the subsidies that are given to um the all

04:00:59.040 --> 04:01:06.080
the inputs to the meat industry like the grain and soy and whatnot um and then to the meat and

04:01:06.080 --> 04:01:10.800
dairy industries and all the subsidies that prop up those industries and allow those products to be

04:01:10.800 --> 04:01:16.480
cheap and and um sustainable from a business perspective not environmental

04:01:18.480 --> 04:01:23.600
it's government subsidies so what if we took all that away and then also what if we gave that to

04:01:24.400 --> 04:01:33.840
um you know the the kale and hemp and fresh greens farmers then and made those foods

04:01:33.840 --> 04:01:41.280
more affordable and then had meat reflect its actual true cost then you know then people would

04:01:41.280 --> 04:01:47.760
just eat more vegetables and less meat because of the cost you mentioned uh the crossed off one item

04:01:47.840 --> 04:01:54.480
from your list i forget what the item was but um oh it was i had previously thought that i would

04:01:54.480 --> 04:01:57.360
want to go to vegas one day just to cross that off my list it's not like

04:01:58.240 --> 04:02:03.360
i was like oh one day i want to go to vegas it was just like i imagined i would only go there once

04:02:03.360 --> 04:02:12.080
just to see it and then be done with it yeah yeah that's a good one that's a good one and i still

04:02:12.080 --> 04:02:16.640
think you can do it because there's a particular vegas experience that's worth having and there's

04:02:16.640 --> 04:02:21.920
maybe a couple of vegas experiences that are worth having i find casinos horribly depressing

04:02:23.280 --> 04:02:27.040
because i think they're just predatory everything about them is predatory it's not it's not it's not

04:02:27.040 --> 04:02:31.600
the casinos that are important it's the people the culture and the whole the people crazy

04:02:31.600 --> 04:02:36.800
atmosphere the people you meet the people you meet in the chaos that is las vegas can create

04:02:37.440 --> 04:02:46.160
a memorable experience you lose track of what is what is day what is night you can get drunk

04:02:46.160 --> 04:02:50.960
can make all the mistakes that somehow create a beautiful masterpiece at the end of it

04:02:51.840 --> 04:02:55.920
that's for another time what else is on the bucket list what items on the bucket list you

04:02:55.920 --> 04:03:02.800
haven't done yet you really really would like we talked about mortality that that there's a finite

04:03:02.800 --> 04:03:08.800
deadline what pops in your head is something that you want to still do what i want is to not die

04:03:08.800 --> 04:03:16.480
and owe people money so so whatever mistakes you make i want to i want to live to write those

04:03:16.480 --> 04:03:26.880
things and i also felt really strongly about my what i what i and everybody in the business had

04:03:26.880 --> 04:03:39.280
built and so a big part of me wants to resurrect the brand because when i i felt really strongly

04:03:39.280 --> 04:03:46.320
about it like i had that feeling that this was this was going to be a thing that i i wanted to

04:03:46.320 --> 04:03:52.960
build and grow and could have a really positive impact and outlast me and would you bring it back

04:03:52.960 --> 04:03:59.520
as the same name yeah well i i put the logo on my arm that's kind of how strongly i felt about it

04:03:59.520 --> 04:04:06.800
and so when i did that and and around that time and all of that time i felt really really strongly

04:04:06.800 --> 04:04:18.400
that um quietly because it feels like a little bit bold but quietly felt really

04:04:18.720 --> 04:04:23.200
almost with a certainty that it was going to be something really big and it was growing and growing

04:04:23.920 --> 04:04:28.640
and all signs were pointing towards there i was just sort of stalled and couldn't figure out the

04:04:28.640 --> 04:04:40.800
logistics and then enter mr fox so the universe can be quite absurdly cruel at times but yeah

04:04:40.960 --> 04:04:47.520
but yeah but that that is something uh that's something worth reaching for

04:04:47.520 --> 04:04:54.560
is repay the debts of the past and then people have said to me that leon achieved some kind of

04:04:54.560 --> 04:05:01.760
immortality via being in the documentary um and then i might i don't understand this world at all

04:05:01.760 --> 04:05:08.000
but i might do like an nft thing related to leon's image which would be another way of

04:05:08.080 --> 04:05:17.360
kind of immortalizing his image at least yeah but that's a um i mean it's a potentially in progress

04:05:18.640 --> 04:05:26.560
kind of a crazy leap but and potentially relaunching the restaurant possibly yes

04:05:27.120 --> 04:05:31.200
there's the restaurant and there's one lucky duck and that brand and they're sort of

04:05:31.200 --> 04:05:38.720
and they're sort of separate but related um and they could each exist independently

04:05:39.280 --> 04:05:44.160
i liked it better when they existed together because i felt like they were very complimentary

04:05:44.160 --> 04:05:49.360
in a lot of ways and they made sense together but either one could be done separately without

04:05:49.360 --> 04:05:56.720
the other do you think you will find love again given the chaos you had to go through

04:05:56.720 --> 04:06:05.200
um i have and i never talk about it i've never talked about it you have found love again

04:06:06.880 --> 04:06:16.400
yes but also in a kind of possibly doomed temporary way which you don't like it simple do you

04:06:17.360 --> 04:06:20.800
it's not that it's not simple it's actually quite simple it's just that

04:06:21.600 --> 04:06:29.120
again there's a large age gap i am the older one which in itself isn't a problem because again i

04:06:29.120 --> 04:06:36.400
wouldn't i wouldn't want to like if somebody wanted kids in a family i wouldn't want to hold

04:06:36.400 --> 04:06:43.520
them back from that and so if i sort of wanted to be with somebody who wanted those things

04:06:44.640 --> 04:06:48.160
i even if i was completely in love with somebody i would have to kind of like

04:06:48.160 --> 04:06:57.280
like you know hurt endure the pain to be like no i'm going to keep you from those things so

04:06:57.280 --> 04:07:05.600
you should go do those things so that's that's the source of the temporariness no it's a bit

04:07:05.600 --> 04:07:15.600
related to like logistics and living one place and having it like extremely different lifestyles

04:07:15.600 --> 04:07:25.760
is this a prince of some sort no does he have a castle um no okay all right no no you're going

04:07:25.760 --> 04:07:30.720
to say who it is or we're going to keep that a mystery i don't on the one hand like i feel

04:07:30.720 --> 04:07:38.560
like it's a it's protective for me to talk about it in some ways but i also worry because

04:07:38.640 --> 04:07:46.160
because very often i avoid saying anything because for a lot of reasons but one being

04:07:46.160 --> 04:07:50.240
that people freak out and just assume that i'm going to step into something horrible again

04:07:50.240 --> 04:07:58.000
because i did step into something horribly destructive again after mr fox and what happened

04:07:58.000 --> 04:08:03.680
was i allowed something to happen and so going back to that what advice would you give to people

04:08:03.680 --> 04:08:09.840
i would i would tell people to be very careful to be deliberate about who they're getting involved

04:08:09.840 --> 04:08:15.600
with and thoughtful about it and making sure that they're not just allowing something to happen so

04:08:15.600 --> 04:08:23.520
it's like you know men can sometimes be and i suppose women can be as well but people can

04:08:23.520 --> 04:08:28.640
be very persistent sometimes that's a good thing but it could also be a dangerous thing because

04:08:28.640 --> 04:08:32.240
sometimes somebody might just and this has happened to me a lot where somebody just wears you down

04:08:32.240 --> 04:08:42.160
and you're like oh fine you know that's funny and yeah no but it works it's shockingly like

04:08:42.160 --> 04:08:46.800
the things that i've done in the spirit of like or not wanting to hurt somebody's feelings that's

04:08:46.800 --> 04:08:51.200
another that's another dangerous to be nice let's get married just to be nice that's another dangerous

04:08:51.200 --> 04:08:55.680
thing and also maybe you should stay i feel like i'm like circling back to all these unanswered

04:08:55.680 --> 04:09:03.040
questions from before but um i didn't marry i married i married him he like convinced me to

04:09:03.040 --> 04:09:08.720
marry him in this very quick annoying way and as if it was like something i had to do and i'd be

04:09:08.720 --> 04:09:15.920
protected and all kinds of weird reasons and it was just like my response to my my agreeing to marry

04:09:15.920 --> 04:09:23.680
him was like oh fine yeah and and then i remember being embarrassed at city hall going to get the

04:09:23.680 --> 04:09:31.040
license you know people who are in love and wanting to get married aren't sitting in city

04:09:31.040 --> 04:09:36.640
hall mortified and embarrassed you know so yeah but so it was so i sort of cringe when people call

04:09:36.640 --> 04:09:42.000
him my ex-husband because i don't think of him that way it's sort of is even though technically

04:09:42.000 --> 04:09:46.480
that's correct yeah but there's uh there's a powerful romantic notion to the thing and

04:09:46.480 --> 04:09:50.240
do those words and that that had nothing to do with you getting married it was more

04:09:50.240 --> 04:09:57.200
it was just like another thing that he made me do like a chore that just had you know unfortunate

04:09:57.200 --> 04:10:02.880
consequences of like then having to get divorced and the whole yeah i think i think even weddings

04:10:02.880 --> 04:10:09.520
are romantic like um the whole the cheesy thing there's you know yeah they are those are cool

04:10:10.480 --> 04:10:16.640
we don't get many many of those in life um well you know what let's keep it a mystery

04:10:17.280 --> 04:10:26.800
let's keep the person a mystery uh to be continued on uh season two on conversations with some like

04:10:26.800 --> 04:10:33.840
a known person or anything but i feel like people always worry that i'm stepping back into something

04:10:33.840 --> 04:10:39.600
and i'm don't have the energy to be should they be defensive and no there you go don't worry

04:10:39.600 --> 04:10:45.280
friends no and also just remember that thing i was saying about how like it's good if you

04:10:45.360 --> 04:10:49.600
get to know somebody really slowly over a long period of time yeah it's kind of one of those

04:10:49.600 --> 04:10:54.800
situations so i feel very confident that i'm like certain that's i'm not stepping into something

04:10:54.800 --> 04:10:59.040
where i'm going to be surprised and somebody turns out to be not who they presented themselves

04:10:59.040 --> 04:11:08.080
to be so that's the wise way to do it especially for me yeah and also again it's like i would i

04:11:08.640 --> 04:11:15.600
would caution people to be careful about um you know wanting to go into something deliberately

04:11:15.600 --> 04:11:23.920
versus kind of getting caught up in something and or rushed or that said i would i would suggest

04:11:23.920 --> 04:11:30.160
people take that cautionary advice but uh sometimes you just fall in love yeah love at first sight is

04:11:30.160 --> 04:11:35.600
a thing there there are those stories of you know sweet stories of older people that i don't have

04:11:35.600 --> 04:11:41.920
to be sweet you can get hurt for it too but don't don't listen to your heart

04:11:44.000 --> 04:11:50.080
this was an incredible conversation uh we talked for way over four hours we did yeah

04:11:50.960 --> 04:11:56.640
and uh yeah i feel like i can keep talking to you this was amazing uh samara thank you so much for

04:11:56.640 --> 04:12:04.480
being honest for for being fearless in answering all the questions all the difficult questions

04:12:05.360 --> 04:12:11.760
um and thank you for trying to create something special with your restaurant

04:12:13.360 --> 04:12:20.000
and maybe create something special still in your future yeah i hope so thank you for having me i

04:12:20.000 --> 04:12:25.680
kept thinking um i kept thinking that like i was going to get a message that was like just kidding

04:12:27.120 --> 04:12:32.800
i just i've listened to your podcast a lot and so i've certainly felt very intimidated knowing who's

04:12:33.600 --> 04:12:40.480
sat if not in this actual chair in this chair in another location or maybe here very were you

04:12:40.480 --> 04:12:48.880
nervous yes and um yeah i was nervous too yeah but at the same but also because i've because i've

04:12:49.600 --> 04:12:54.240
know the way that you speak in your style i felt like it was gonna feel like a good natural

04:12:54.240 --> 04:12:57.360
conversation as opposed to sometimes you have conversations where it's like

04:12:57.360 --> 04:13:04.960
like anyway so i didn't feel nervous because of like what i was walking into i felt nervous that

04:13:04.960 --> 04:13:10.720
i was gonna you know sound stupid and boring and everybody would be like why did he interview her

04:13:10.720 --> 04:13:19.680
like it was not it was exciting you happy with it how do we do yeah i think so very often after

04:13:19.680 --> 04:13:25.280
are you self-critical after stuff yes like when you go home tonight are you gonna be like happy

04:13:25.280 --> 04:13:31.360
with yourself or not i mean i feel good i don't feel like i can't think of anything that i said

04:13:31.360 --> 04:13:35.600
that i regret maybe there's things that you know somebody's gonna yell at me because i said

04:13:35.600 --> 04:13:38.880
something that i said like meat tastes good or something or i don't you know like this

04:13:39.600 --> 04:13:48.480
the like vegan judgment yes um yes but i think it's more useful to be honest about the contradictions

04:13:48.480 --> 04:13:53.120
and conflicting feelings because i feel like that's what most people have and so if you want to

04:13:53.120 --> 04:14:00.480
help people shift a certain way yeah you were raw honest it was beautiful it was beautiful

04:14:00.480 --> 04:14:09.760
to watch thank you for the books your darkness today was visible but the beauty too it was an

04:14:09.760 --> 04:14:15.280
