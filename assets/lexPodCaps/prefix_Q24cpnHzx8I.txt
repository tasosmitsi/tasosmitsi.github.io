00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
The following is a conversation with Yoram Brook and Yoram Hozoni.

00:04.440 --> 00:09.160
This is Yoram's third time on this podcast and Yoram's first time.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.520
Yoram Brook is an objectivist philosopher, chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute,

00:14.880 --> 00:19.640
host of the Yoram Brook show and the co-author of Free Market Revolution.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.360
And equal is unfair.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.680
Yoram Hozoni is a national conservatism thinker,

00:26.000 --> 00:31.800
chairman of the Edmund Burke Foundation that hosted the National Conservatism Conference.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.160
He is also the host of the NatCon Talk

00:35.800 --> 00:40.080
and author of The Virtue of Nationalism and an upcoming book

00:40.320 --> 00:43.400
called Conservatism, a Rediscovery.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.800
Allow me to say a few words about each part of the two word title

00:49.080 --> 00:51.920
of this episode, Nationalism Debate.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.320
First, debate.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.520
I would like to have a few conversations this year that are a kind of debate

00:58.520 --> 01:02.320
with two or three people that hold differing views on a particular topic,

01:02.600 --> 01:07.400
but come to the table with respect for each other and a desire to learn

01:07.400 --> 01:11.400
and discover something interesting together through the empathetic exploration

01:11.400 --> 01:13.560
of the tension between their ideas.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.040
This is not strictly a debate.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.840
It is simply a conversation.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.600
There is no structure.

01:19.600 --> 01:24.080
There's no winners, except, of course, just a bit of trash talking to keep it fun.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.760
Some of these topics will be very difficult,

01:27.200 --> 01:30.040
and I hope you can keep an open mind and have patience with me

01:30.960 --> 01:34.880
as kind of moderator who tries to bring out the best in each person

01:34.880 --> 01:36.920
and the ideas discussed.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.280
OK, that's my comment on the word debate.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.880
Now onto the word nationalism.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.640
This debate could have been called nationalism versus individualism

01:46.080 --> 01:49.240
or national conservatism versus individualism

01:49.640 --> 01:53.240
or just conservatism versus individualism.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.520
As we discuss in this episode, these words have slightly different

01:57.520 --> 01:59.520
meanings depending on who you ask.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.400
This is especially true, I think, for any word that ends in ism.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.960
I personally enjoy the discussion of the meaning of such philosophical words.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.200
I don't think it's possible to arrive at a perfect definition

02:11.400 --> 02:15.240
that everybody agrees with, but the process of trying to do

02:15.240 --> 02:19.760
so for a bit is interesting and productive, at least to me.

02:20.400 --> 02:25.240
As long as we don't get stuck there, some folks sometimes do in these conversations.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.880
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

02:27.880 --> 02:31.120
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.160
And now here's my conversation with Yaron Brook and Yoram Hozoni.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.360
I attended the excellent debate between the two of you yesterday at UT Austin.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.600
The debate was between ideas of conservatism represented by Yaron Hozoni

02:46.240 --> 02:49.960
and ideas of individualism represented by Yaron Brook.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.760
Let's start with the topics of the debate.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.360
Yoram, how do you define conservatism?

02:55.600 --> 02:58.000
Maybe in the way you were thinking about it yesterday.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.440
What do you are some principles of conservatism?

03:02.200 --> 03:06.960
Let me define it and then we can we can get into principles if you want.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.240
When I when I talk about political conservatism,

03:09.680 --> 03:13.160
I'm talking about a political standpoint that

03:14.040 --> 03:19.320
regards the recovery, elaboration and restoration of tradition

03:19.960 --> 03:23.240
as the key to maintaining a nation and strengthening it through time.

03:23.880 --> 03:28.040
OK, so this is something that if you have time to talk about it,

03:28.040 --> 03:31.680
like we do on the show, it's worth emphasizing that conservatism

03:32.440 --> 03:35.520
is is not like liberalism or Marxism.

03:35.520 --> 03:39.600
Liberalism and Marxism are both kind of universal theories,

03:39.760 --> 03:42.560
and they claim to be able to tell you

03:43.120 --> 03:46.200
what's good for human beings at all times, in all places.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.440
And conservatism is a little bit different because it's going to carry

03:50.440 --> 03:54.080
different values in every nation and every tribe.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.000
Even every family, you can say, has somewhat different values.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.640
And these loyalty groups, they compete with one another.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.600
That's the way human beings work.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.600
So it's deeply rooted in history of that particular area of land.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.640
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say land.

04:10.640 --> 04:15.800
You're right that many forms of conservatism are tied to a particular place.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.280
So how does the implementation of conservatism to you differ

04:19.760 --> 04:23.560
from the ideal of conservatism, the implementations you've seen

04:23.840 --> 04:26.760
of political conservatism in the United States and the rest of the world?

04:26.960 --> 04:31.680
Just to give some context, because it's a loaded term, most political terms.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.200
So when people think about conservative in the United States,

04:35.200 --> 04:37.800
they think about the Republican Party.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.640
Can you kind of disambiguate some of this?

04:41.040 --> 04:41.880
What are we supposed to think?

04:41.880 --> 04:44.200
Yeah, that's a really important question.

04:44.200 --> 04:49.000
Usually the word conservative is associated with Edmund Burke

04:49.000 --> 04:53.680
and with the English common law tradition.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.680
Going back centuries and centuries, there's kind of a classical English

04:58.760 --> 05:03.080
conservative tradition that goes Fortescue, Hooker,

05:04.080 --> 05:09.200
Coke, Seldon, Hale, Burke, Blackstone before Burke.

05:10.800 --> 05:15.800
If you take that kind of as a benchmark and you compare it,

05:15.800 --> 05:20.080
then you can compare it to things like the American Federalist Party

05:20.240 --> 05:24.360
at the time of the American founding is in many respects very much,

05:24.800 --> 05:26.720
very much in keeping with that tradition.

05:27.440 --> 05:35.720
As you go forward, there's an increasing mix of liberalism into conservatism.

05:35.720 --> 05:43.400
And I think by the time you get to the 1960s with William Buckley and Frank Meyer,

05:43.400 --> 05:45.560
you know, the jargon term is fusionism.

05:45.560 --> 05:51.080
By the time you get there, it's arguable that their conservatism

05:51.080 --> 05:55.920
isn't very conservative anymore, that it's kind of a public liberalism

05:55.920 --> 05:57.760
mixed with a private conservatism.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.880
So a lot of the debate that we have today about, you know,

06:01.880 --> 06:04.280
what does the word conservatism actually mean?

06:04.280 --> 06:09.760
A lot of the confusion comes from that, comes from the fact that on the one hand,

06:09.760 --> 06:15.440
we have people who use the term, I think, properly historically to refer

06:15.440 --> 06:19.200
to this common law tradition of which Burke was a spokesman.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.640
But there are lots of other people who, when they say conservative,

06:23.640 --> 06:28.960
they just mean liberal, and I think that that's a big problem.

06:28.960 --> 06:33.360
I mean, it's a problem just to have an intelligent debate is difficult

06:33.360 --> 06:39.440
when people are using the word almost too antithetical.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.920
What would you say the essential idea of conservatism is?

06:41.920 --> 06:44.200
Time? You mentioned your father's a physicist.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.560
So a lot of physicists, when they form models of the universe,

06:48.600 --> 06:50.360
they don't consider time.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.280
So everything is dealt with instantaneously.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.720
A particle is represented fully by its current state, velocity and position.

06:58.720 --> 07:04.880
You're saying, so you're arguing with all of physics and your father,

07:04.880 --> 07:10.040
as we always do, that their time matters in conservatism.

07:10.040 --> 07:13.320
That's the fundamental element is the full history matters.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.880
And you cannot separate the individual from the history,

07:16.880 --> 07:18.960
from the roots that they come from.

07:18.960 --> 07:24.560
The parallel in political theory is what's called rationalism.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.560
I guess we'll probably talk about that some.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.160
Rationalism is kind of an instantaneous timeless thing.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.880
Before I mentioned that liberalism and

07:33.880 --> 07:37.480
various enlightenment theories, they don't include time at all.

07:37.480 --> 07:42.760
Their goal is to say, look, there's such a thing as universal human reason.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.360
All human beings, if they reason properly, will come to the same conclusions.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.560
If that's true, then it removes the time consideration.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.520
It removes tradition and context.

07:53.520 --> 07:59.360
Because everywhere where you are at any time, you ought to be able to use reason

07:59.360 --> 08:03.480
and come to the same conclusions about politics or morals.

08:03.480 --> 08:09.600
So that's a theory like Immanuel Kant or John Locke is an example.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.680
Hobbes is an example.

08:11.520 --> 08:17.800
That kind of political theorizing really does say at a given instant,

08:17.800 --> 08:22.240
we can know pretty much everything that we need to know, at least the big things.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.800
And conservatism is the opposite.

08:25.800 --> 08:32.160
It's a traditionalist view, exactly as you say, that says that history is crucial.

08:33.320 --> 08:40.000
So you say that history is interesting, but perhaps not crucial.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.600
In the context of individualism.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.720
No, I mean, I think there's a false dichotomy he presented here.

08:45.720 --> 08:51.480
And that is that one view holds that you can derive anything from a particular

08:51.480 --> 08:54.760
historical path and kind of an empirical view.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.320
And if we know the history, we know where we should be tomorrow.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.040
We know where we should stand today.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.600
And the other path is we ignore history, we ignore facts,

09:03.600 --> 09:08.120
we ignore what's going on, we can derive from some a priori axioms.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.600
We can derive a truth right now.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.520
And both are false.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.680
Both of those views in my view are false.

09:13.680 --> 09:19.480
And, you know, Ayn Rand and I reject both of those views.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.520
And I think the better thinkers of the Enlightenment did as well,

09:22.520 --> 09:25.880
although they sometimes fall into the trap of appearing like rationalists.

09:25.880 --> 09:32.760
And you know, I mean, I agree on one thing, and that is that Kant is one of you know,

09:32.760 --> 09:36.800
we've talked about this in the past, Alex, but we both hate Kant.

09:36.800 --> 09:42.880
We both think Kant is, I at least think Kant is probably the most destructive

09:42.880 --> 09:47.720
philosopher since Plato, who is pretty destructive himself.

09:47.720 --> 09:52.800
But and part of the problem is that Kant divorces reason from reality.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.960
That is, he divorces reason from history.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.960
He divorces reason from experience because we don't have direct experience

09:58.960 --> 10:03.160
of reality, according to Kant, right, we're removed from that direct experience.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.400
But I view Kant as the anti-Enlightenment.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.880
That is, I view Kant as the destroyer of good Enlightenment thinking.

10:10.880 --> 10:16.240
And I acknowledge a lot of history of philosophy,

10:16.240 --> 10:20.240
the people who do history of philosophy view Kant as the embodiment of the Enlightenment.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.440
That is the ultimate.

10:21.440 --> 10:22.920
But I think that's a mistake.

10:22.920 --> 10:27.480
I think both Rousseau and Kant are fundamentally the goal,

10:27.480 --> 10:30.200
the mission in life is to destroy the Enlightenment.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.640
So my view is neither of those options are the right option.

10:33.680 --> 10:38.960
That is, the true reason based, reason is not divorced from reality.

10:38.960 --> 10:39.760
It's quite the opposite.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.960
Reason is a tool.

10:40.960 --> 10:46.480
It's a faculty of identifying and integrating what it's identifying and

10:46.480 --> 10:52.800
integrating the facts of reality as we know them through sense perception or

10:52.800 --> 10:55.720
through the study of history, through what actually happened.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.000
So it's the integration of those facts.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.160
It's the knowledge of that history.

11:00.200 --> 11:05.320
And then what we do is we abstract away principles based on what's worked in

11:05.320 --> 11:08.960
the past, what hasn't worked in the past, the consequences of different ideas,

11:08.960 --> 11:10.840
different past, different actions.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.600
We abstract away principles that then can be universal.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.200
Not always, we make mistakes, right?

11:16.200 --> 11:19.520
We can come up with a universal principle, it turns out it's not.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.480
But if we have the whole scope of human history, we can derive principles as we

11:23.480 --> 11:29.360
do in life, as individuals, we derive principles that are then truths

11:29.360 --> 11:32.040
that we can live by, but you don't do that by ignoring history.

11:32.040 --> 11:36.160
You do that by learning history, by understanding history, by understanding,

11:36.160 --> 11:39.880
in a sense, tradition and where it leads to, and then trying to do better.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.880
And I think good thinkers are constantly trying to do better based on what they

11:43.880 --> 11:46.000
know about the past and what they know about the present.

11:46.000 --> 11:53.560
What's the difference between studying history on a journey of reason and tradition?

11:53.560 --> 11:57.200
So you mentioned that Burke understood that reason begins with inherited

11:57.200 --> 11:59.000
tradition yesterday.

11:59.000 --> 12:03.320
So what's the difference between studying history, but then being free to go

12:03.320 --> 12:11.440
any way you want and tradition where it feels more, I don't want to say a negative

12:11.440 --> 12:17.320
term like burden, but there's more of a momentum that forces you to go the same

12:17.320 --> 12:18.800
way as your ancestors.

12:18.800 --> 12:23.160
It's the recognition that people are wrong, often are wrong.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.640
Including your parents?

12:24.640 --> 12:28.320
Including your parents, including your teachers, including everybody.

12:28.320 --> 12:33.720
Everybody is potentially wrong, and that you can't accept anybody just because

12:33.720 --> 12:35.720
they happen to come before you.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.920
That is, you have to evaluate and judge, and you have to have a standard by which

12:38.920 --> 12:42.440
to evaluate and judge the actions of those who came before you, whether they

12:42.440 --> 12:47.280
are your parents, whether they are the state in which you happen to be born,

12:47.280 --> 12:50.720
whether they are somebody on the other side of planet Earth.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.960
You can judge them if you have a standard.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.400
Now, my standard, and I think the right standard, is human well-being.

12:57.360 --> 13:03.560
That which is good for human beings, qua-human beings, is the standard by which we judge.

13:03.560 --> 13:07.600
I can say that certain periods of history were bad.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.520
They happened.

13:08.520 --> 13:09.560
It's important to study them.

13:09.560 --> 13:13.440
It's important to understand what they did that made them bad so we cannot do that

13:13.440 --> 13:17.480
again, and I can say certain cultures, certain periods in time were good.

13:17.480 --> 13:17.760
Why?

13:17.760 --> 13:21.120
Because they promoted human well-being and human flourishing.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.000
That's the standard.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.040
Then derive from that, okay, what is it that made a particular culture good?

13:26.040 --> 13:30.040
What is it that made that particular culture positive in terms of human well-being

13:30.040 --> 13:31.160
and human flourishing?

13:31.160 --> 13:32.200
What made this bad?

13:32.200 --> 13:34.880
And hopefully from that, I can derive a principle.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.680
Okay, if I want human flourishing and human well-being in the future,

13:38.680 --> 13:41.320
I want to be more like these guys and less like those guys.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.080
I want to derive what is the principle that will guide me in the future.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.720
That's, I think, how human knowledge ultimately develops.

13:47.720 --> 13:51.800
I think people often make a mistake just, I'm not saying you're wrong,

13:51.800 --> 13:54.840
but lots of people don't actually read the original sources.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.280
What happens is people will attack conservatives, assuming that conservatives

14:00.280 --> 14:02.280
think that whatever comes from the past is right.

14:03.240 --> 14:07.480
Actually, it's very difficult to find a thinker who actually says something like that.

14:08.600 --> 14:14.280
Seldin or Burke, the big conservative theorists, Hooker, they're all people who

14:14.840 --> 14:20.200
understand that the tradition carries with it mistakes that were made in the past.

14:20.520 --> 14:27.000
And this is actually, I think, an important part of their empiricism is that they see

14:27.000 --> 14:30.920
the search for truth as something a society does by trial and error.

14:30.920 --> 14:36.280
And what that means is that at any given moment, you have to be aware of the possibility

14:36.280 --> 14:39.400
that things that you've inherited are actually false.

14:39.400 --> 14:46.280
And the job of the political thinker or the jurist or the philosopher is not to dig in

14:46.360 --> 14:48.760
and say whatever it is that we've inherited is right.

14:49.880 --> 14:55.320
The job is to look at the society as a whole and say, look, we have this job of,

14:56.680 --> 15:00.520
first of all, conservation, just making sure that we don't lose good things that we've had.

15:01.080 --> 15:05.960
And second, seeing if we can repair things in order to improve them where it's necessary

15:05.960 --> 15:07.000
or where it's possible.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.760
And that process is actually a creative process.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.880
This is a way in which I think it is similar to your own philosophy,

15:13.880 --> 15:20.360
that you take the inherited tradition and you look for a way that you can shape it in

15:20.360 --> 15:23.560
order to make it something better than it was.

15:24.520 --> 15:28.280
That's a baseline for what we call conservatism.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.560
It's just a comment.

15:29.560 --> 15:34.200
So the trial and error, the errors, you're proud of the errors.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.760
It's a feature, not a bug.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.320
So you mentioned trial and error a few times yesterday.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.760
It's a really interesting kind of idea.

15:41.320 --> 15:47.400
It's basically accepting that the journey is going to have flaws as opposed to saying,

15:47.960 --> 15:54.280
I mean, the conclusion there is the current system is flawed and it will always be flawed.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.160
And you try to improve it.

15:57.160 --> 16:04.600
When you listen to your own talk, there's much more of an optimism for the system being perfect

16:05.880 --> 16:09.320
now or potentially soon or could be perfect.

16:09.560 --> 16:14.920
To me, the way I heard it is almost like accepting that the system is flawed

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
and through trial and error will improve.

16:17.720 --> 16:24.520
And Youran says, no, we can have a perfection now.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.160
That's what it sounds to me.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.160
Yeah. And I think that's right.

16:29.160 --> 16:33.400
I think the difference is that at some point, just like in science, I think,

16:34.120 --> 16:40.040
one can stop the trial and error and say, I can now see a pattern here.

16:40.040 --> 16:44.840
I can see that certain actions lead to bad consequences,

16:44.840 --> 16:46.920
certain actions lead to good consequences.

16:46.920 --> 16:52.760
Let me try to abstract away what is it that is good and what is it that is bad

16:53.400 --> 16:57.000
and build a system around what is good and reject what is bad.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.600
I think ultimately, if you read the founding fathers and whether we call them conservatives,

17:00.600 --> 17:05.000
individuals, what the founding fathers actually did, all of them, I think, is study history.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.800
They all did.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.000
They all talk about history.

17:07.000 --> 17:14.440
They all talk about examples of other cultures, whether they go back to the Republic in Venice

17:14.440 --> 17:16.200
or back to the ancient Greeks.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.520
So they studied these.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.280
They learned lessons from them.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.520
They try to figure out what has worked in the past and what hasn't and try to do our principles.

17:24.840 --> 17:30.520
In my view, they got pretty close to what I would consider kind of an ideal,

17:31.160 --> 17:33.480
but they didn't get it completely right.

17:33.480 --> 17:38.280
Here we sit 200-something years after the declaration and after the Constitution.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.080
I think we can look back and say, okay, well, what did they get right?

17:41.080 --> 17:47.320
What did they get wrong based on how is it done and where are the flaws and we can improve on it?

17:48.280 --> 17:56.440
I think we can get closer to perfection and based on those kind of observations, based on

17:56.440 --> 18:00.920
that kind of abstraction, that kind of discovery of what is true, just like

18:01.640 --> 18:05.560
at some point you do the experiments, you do the trial and error, and now you come up with a

18:05.560 --> 18:06.680
scientific principle.

18:06.680 --> 18:11.480
It is true that 100 years later, you might discover that, hey, I missed something, there's

18:11.480 --> 18:19.880
something, but to not take the full lesson, to insist on incrementalism, to insist on we're

18:19.880 --> 18:23.640
just going to tinker with the system instead of saying, no, there's something really wrong

18:24.280 --> 18:25.480
with having a king.

18:25.480 --> 18:31.880
There's something really wrong with not having any representation or whatever the standard

18:31.880 --> 18:32.440
needs to be.

18:33.480 --> 18:38.360
In the name of we don't want to move too fast, I think is a mistake and the problem with trial

18:38.360 --> 18:44.120
and error in politics is that we're talking about human life.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.880
There was a big trial around communism and 100 million people paid the price for the trial.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.280
I could have told them in advance, as did many people, that it would not work.

18:56.280 --> 19:00.760
There are principles of human nature, principles that we can study from history,

19:00.760 --> 19:03.880
principles about economics and other aspects.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.000
Well, we know it's not going to work.

19:05.000 --> 19:05.960
You don't need to try it again.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.960
We've had communal arrangements throughout history.

19:09.960 --> 19:14.840
There was an experiment with fascism and there have been experiments with all kinds of political

19:14.840 --> 19:15.640
systems.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.320
Okay, we've done them.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.960
Sad that we did them because many of us knew they wouldn't work.

19:20.520 --> 19:26.280
We should learn the lesson and I think that all of history now converges on one lesson,

19:26.280 --> 19:30.760
and that is what we need to do is build systems that protect individual freedom.

19:30.760 --> 19:31.720
That is the core.

19:31.800 --> 19:36.840
That's what ultimately leads to human flourishing and human success and human achievement.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.760
To the extent that we place anything above that individual, whether it's the state,

19:40.760 --> 19:44.200
whether it's the ethnicity, whether it's the race, whether it's the bourgeois,

19:44.200 --> 19:47.480
whether it's whatever it happens to be, a class or whatever.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.440
Whenever we place something above the individual, the consequence is negative.

19:50.440 --> 19:58.520
That's one of these principles that I think we can derive from studying 3,000 years of civilization.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.160
And it's tragic, I think, because we're going to keep experimenting.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.760
Sadly, I see it, right?

20:04.760 --> 20:05.960
I'm not winning this battle.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.280
I'm losing the battle.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.640
We're going to keep experimenting with different forms of collectivism or we're going to keep

20:11.640 --> 20:17.320
paying the price in human life and in missed opportunities for human flourishing and human

20:17.320 --> 20:19.480
success and human wealth and prosperity.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.680
Let's take communism as a good example.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.320
None of the major conservative thinkers would say, you know what's a good idea?

20:27.320 --> 20:33.000
A good idea would be to experiment by raising everything that we've inherited

20:33.000 --> 20:34.360
and starting from scratch.

20:34.360 --> 20:39.880
I mean, that's the conservative complaint or accusation against rationalists.

20:39.880 --> 20:42.680
I mean, as opposed to empiricism, using rationalism.

20:43.880 --> 20:47.240
Let's take Descartes kind of as a benchmark.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.920
Can you also maybe define rationalism?

20:49.480 --> 20:49.800
Yeah.

20:49.800 --> 20:54.680
These are two terms that are in philosophy, especially in epistemology.

20:54.680 --> 20:58.040
They're often compared to one another.

20:58.040 --> 21:03.720
Your own said that it's a false dichotomy and maybe it is a bit exaggerated, but that

21:03.720 --> 21:07.800
doesn't mean it's not useful for conceptualizing the domain.

21:07.800 --> 21:15.880
So rationalist is somebody like Descartes who says, I'm going to set aside, I'm going to

21:15.880 --> 21:20.680
try to set aside everything I know, everything I've inherited, I'm going to start from scratch.

21:20.760 --> 21:27.080
And he explicitly says, in evaluating the inheritance of the past, he explicitly says,

21:27.640 --> 21:30.440
you take a look at the histories that we have, they're not reliable.

21:30.440 --> 21:33.720
You take a look at the moral and the scientific writings that we receive,

21:33.720 --> 21:35.080
they're not very good.

21:35.080 --> 21:41.640
His baseline is to look very critically at the past and say, look, I'm evaluating it.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.440
I think all in all, it's just not worth very much.

21:44.440 --> 21:50.120
And so whatever I do beginning from scratch is going to be better as long as,

21:50.120 --> 21:58.040
and here's his caveat, as long as I'm proceeding from self-evident assumptions,

21:58.040 --> 22:01.000
from self-evident premises, things that you can't argue against.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.520
I think therefore I am.

22:02.520 --> 22:02.840
Right.

22:02.840 --> 22:07.160
And then from there, deducing what he calls infallible conclusions.

22:07.160 --> 22:11.880
So that model of self-evident premises to infallible conclusions,

22:12.760 --> 22:14.040
I'm calling that rationalism.

22:14.040 --> 22:19.160
I think that's kind of a standard academic jargon term.

22:19.160 --> 22:26.040
And it's opposed to empiricism, which is a thinker, I think in universities,

22:26.040 --> 22:29.960
usually the empiricist is David Hume.

22:29.960 --> 22:36.040
And David Hume will say, we can't learn anything the way that Descartes said.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.720
I mean, there is nothing that's that self-evident and that infallible.

22:40.280 --> 22:49.880
So Hume proposes, based on Newton and Boyle and the new physical sciences,

22:49.880 --> 22:52.920
so Hume proposes a science of man.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.560
And the science of man sounds an awful lot like what Youran just said,

22:55.560 --> 23:00.520
which is we're going to take a look at human nature, at the nature of societies.

23:01.240 --> 23:06.120
Human nature, we're going to try to abstract towards fixed principles for describing it.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.200
Human societies, we're going to try to do the same thing.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.840
And from there, we get, for example, contemporary economics.

23:13.480 --> 23:19.080
But we also get sociology and anthropology, which cut in a different direction.

23:19.080 --> 23:23.480
So that's rationalism versus empiricism.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.360
Can I just say-

23:24.360 --> 23:24.840
Yeah, go ahead, please.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.280
Yeah, I agree with that.

23:26.280 --> 23:31.480
I think empiricism, the one thing I disagree is I think empiricism

23:32.360 --> 23:34.520
rarely comes to these abstractions.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.280
I mean, they want more facts.

23:36.280 --> 23:39.640
It's always about collecting more evidence in the abstract.

23:39.640 --> 23:45.160
But this is where I think Ayn Rand is so unusual and where I think

23:45.880 --> 23:47.400
there's something new here, right?

23:47.400 --> 23:50.200
And that's a bold statement given the history of philosophy,

23:50.200 --> 23:52.840
but I think Ayn Rand is something new.

23:52.840 --> 23:58.280
And so she says, yes, we agree about rationalism and it's inherently wrong.

23:58.840 --> 24:02.120
Empiricism has the problem of, okay, where does it lead?

24:03.080 --> 24:06.120
You never come to a conclusion, you're just accumulating evidence.

24:06.280 --> 24:10.040
Something in addition, there's a third alternative, which she is positing,

24:10.760 --> 24:15.720
which is using empirical evidence, not denying empirical evidence,

24:16.520 --> 24:18.280
recognizing that there are some axioms.

24:18.280 --> 24:22.200
There's some axioms that we all, at the base of all of our knowledge,

24:22.200 --> 24:26.440
that are starting points, we're not rejecting axiomatic knowledge.

24:27.080 --> 24:31.640
And integrating those two and identifying the fact that based on these axioms

24:31.640 --> 24:35.800
and based on these empirical evidence, we can come to truths.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.000
Just again, like we do in science, we have certain axioms,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.560
scientific axioms, we have certain experiments that we run,

24:41.560 --> 24:44.360
and then we can come to some identification of a truth.

24:44.360 --> 24:47.160
And that truth is always going to be challenged by new information,

24:47.160 --> 24:52.600
by new knowledge, but as long as that's what we know, that is what's true.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.480
So truth is contextual in the sense that it's contextual,

24:55.480 --> 24:59.320
it's based on that knowledge that surrounds it.

24:59.880 --> 25:06.440
It's always available to change if the facts that you get, and they really are.

25:06.440 --> 25:11.800
I mean, the burden of changing what you've come to, a conclusion of truth is high,

25:11.800 --> 25:16.040
so you'd have to have real evidence that it's not true, but that happens all the time.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.480
So it happens in science, right?

25:17.480 --> 25:19.560
We discovered that what we thought was true is not true,

25:19.560 --> 25:23.800
and it can happen in politics and ethics even more so than in science

25:23.800 --> 25:26.600
because they're much messier fields.

25:27.080 --> 25:33.400
But the idea is that you can come to a truth, but it's not just deductive.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.960
Most truths are inductive.

25:35.960 --> 25:39.720
We learn from observing reality and again,

25:39.720 --> 25:42.440
coming to principles about what works and what's not.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.640
And here I think this is, Ayn Rand is different.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.680
She doesn't fall into the, and she's different in her politics

25:48.680 --> 25:50.280
and she's different in her epistemology.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.320
She doesn't fall into the conventional view.

25:54.040 --> 25:56.600
She's an opponent of Hume and she's an opponent of Descartes,

25:57.240 --> 25:58.680
and she's certainly an opponent of Kant's.

26:02.040 --> 26:02.840
I think she's right.

26:03.880 --> 26:08.520
If it's okay, can we walk back to criticism of communism?

26:09.160 --> 26:11.560
You're both critics of communism and socialism.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.960
Why did communism fail?

26:13.960 --> 26:21.000
You started to say that conservatives criticize it on the basis of rationalism,

26:21.000 --> 26:22.360
that you're throwing away the past.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.440
You're starting from scratch.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.320
Is that the fundamental description of why communism failed?

26:27.320 --> 26:33.240
I think the fundamental difference between rationalists and empiricists

26:33.240 --> 26:35.160
is the question of whether you're throwing away the past.

26:35.800 --> 26:37.400
That's the argument.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.360
And it cashes out as a distinction between

26:41.000 --> 26:44.200
abstract universal rationalist political theories

26:45.000 --> 26:47.800
and empirical political theories.

26:47.800 --> 26:52.680
Empirical political theories, they're always going to say something like,

26:54.200 --> 26:58.440
look, there are many different societies.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.080
We can say that some are better and some are worse.

27:01.640 --> 27:07.800
But the problem is that there are many different ways

27:07.800 --> 27:10.040
in which a society can be better or worse.

27:10.840 --> 27:14.600
There's an ongoing competition and we're learning on an ongoing basis

27:14.600 --> 27:16.920
what are the ways in which societies can be better and worse.

27:17.480 --> 27:21.080
That creates, I'd say, a mild skepticism,

27:21.080 --> 27:24.360
a moderate skepticism among conservatives.

27:24.360 --> 27:28.840
I don't think too many conservatives have a problem looking at the Soviet Union,

27:28.840 --> 27:34.440
which is brutal and murderous, ineffective in its economics,

27:34.440 --> 27:37.560
totally ineffective spiritually, and then collapsed.

27:39.720 --> 27:42.440
So I think it's easier for us to look at a system like that

27:43.160 --> 27:44.760
and say, what on earth?

27:45.320 --> 27:46.520
What should we learn from that?

27:47.240 --> 27:51.080
But the main conservative tradition is pretty tolerant

27:51.080 --> 27:54.520
of a diversity of different kinds of society

27:54.520 --> 27:59.960
and is slow to insist that France is so tyrannical it just needs a revolution

27:59.960 --> 28:02.920
because what's going to come after the revolution is going to be much better.

28:02.920 --> 28:08.760
The assumption is that there's lots of things that are good about most societies

28:08.760 --> 28:14.760
and that a clean slate leads you to throw out all of the inherited things

28:14.760 --> 28:17.960
that you don't even know how to notice until they're gone.

28:17.960 --> 28:21.560
Could I actually play devil's advocate here and address something you also said?

28:22.840 --> 28:27.640
Can we, as opposed to knowing the empirical data of the 20th century

28:27.640 --> 28:31.800
that communism presented, can we go back to the beginning of the 20th century?

28:32.680 --> 28:36.760
Can you empathize or steel man or put yourself in a place

28:37.320 --> 28:40.520
of the Soviet Union where the workers are being disrespected?

28:41.320 --> 28:45.880
And can you not see that the conservatives could be pro-communism?

28:47.480 --> 28:52.520
Communism is such a strongly negative word in modern day political discourse

28:52.520 --> 28:59.480
that you have to put yourself in the mind of people who like red colors.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.480
It's all about the branding, I think.

29:06.120 --> 29:16.120
But also the ideas of solidarity, of nation, of togetherness, of respect for fellow man.

29:16.920 --> 29:20.040
All of these things that communism represents, can you not see

29:20.680 --> 29:26.520
that this idea is actually going along with conservatism?

29:26.520 --> 29:30.760
It is in some ways respecting the deep ideals of the past,

29:31.480 --> 29:37.960
but proposing a new way to raise those ideals, implement those ideals in the system.

29:37.960 --> 29:42.600
Yes, I'm going to try to do what you're suggesting, but historically we actually have

29:42.600 --> 29:45.560
a more useful option, I think, for both of our positions.

29:45.560 --> 29:52.520
Instead of pretending that we like the actual communists, we have conservative statesmen

29:52.520 --> 29:59.080
like Disraeli and Bismarck who initiated social legislation.

29:59.880 --> 30:07.800
The first step towards saying, look, we're one nation, we're undergoing industrialization.

30:08.600 --> 30:13.160
That industrialization is important and positive, but it's also doing

30:13.800 --> 30:15.480
a lot of damage to a lot of people.

30:15.480 --> 30:19.240
And in particular, it's doing damage not just to individuals and families,

30:19.240 --> 30:24.840
but it's doing damage to the social fabric, the capacity of Britain or

30:24.840 --> 30:27.720
German to remain cohesive society as it is being harmed.

30:28.920 --> 30:34.760
It's these two conservative statesmen, Disraeli and Bismarck, who actually take the first steps

30:35.560 --> 30:41.240
in order to legislate for what today we would consider to be minimal social programs,

30:41.240 --> 30:44.360
pensions and disability insurance and those kinds of things.

30:45.480 --> 30:50.680
For sure, conservatives do look at industrialization as a rapid change.

30:51.080 --> 30:55.960
And they say, we do have to care about the nation as a whole and we have to care about

30:55.960 --> 30:56.760
it as a unity.

30:56.760 --> 31:03.000
And I assume that your own will say, look, that's the first step towards the catastrophe

31:03.000 --> 31:03.720
of communism.

31:04.280 --> 31:10.920
But before your own drives that nail into the coffin, let me try to make a distinction.

31:10.920 --> 31:16.520
Because when you read Marx, you're reading an intellectual descendant of Descartes.

31:17.000 --> 31:25.640
You're reading somebody who says, look, every society consists of oppressors and oppressed.

31:26.840 --> 31:31.720
And that's an improvement in some ways over liberal thinking because at least he's seeing

31:31.720 --> 31:34.920
groups as a real social phenomenon.

31:34.920 --> 31:38.600
But he says every society has an oppressor class and oppressed class.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.880
There are different classes, there are different groups, and whenever one is stronger,

31:41.880 --> 31:43.640
it exploits the ones that are weaker.

31:44.600 --> 31:50.760
That is the foundation of a revolutionary political theory.

31:50.760 --> 31:51.080
Why?

31:51.080 --> 31:56.600
Because the moment that you say that the only relationship between the stronger and the weaker

31:56.600 --> 32:01.960
is exploitation, the moment that you say that, then you're pushed into the position.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.680
And Marx and Engels say this explicitly, you're pushed into the position.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.560
We're saying, when will the exploitation end?

32:07.560 --> 32:09.000
Never until there's a revolution.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.440
What happens when there's a revolution?

32:10.440 --> 32:12.600
You eliminate the oppressor class.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.040
It's annihilationist.

32:14.040 --> 32:20.360
I mean, you can immediately, when you read it, see why it's different from Descartes

32:20.360 --> 32:25.080
or Bismarck because they're trying to keep everybody somehow at peace with one another.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.480
And Marx is saying, there is no peace.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.960
That oppressor class has to be annihilated.

32:29.960 --> 32:34.200
And then they go ahead and do it, and they kill 100 million people.

32:34.200 --> 32:40.360
So I do think that despite the fact your question is good and right, there are certain similarities

32:40.360 --> 32:43.080
and concern, but still, I think you can tell the difference.

32:43.080 --> 32:47.800
That extra step of revolution, to you, is where the problem comes.

32:47.800 --> 32:52.120
That extra step of let's kill all the oppressors, that's the problem.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.280
And then to you, you're on the whole step one is the problem.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.800
Well, it's all a problem.

32:57.800 --> 33:05.480
First, I don't view communism as something that radical in a sense that I think it comes

33:05.480 --> 33:07.960
from a tradition of collectivism.

33:07.960 --> 33:12.120
I think it comes from a tradition of looking at groups and measuring things in terms of

33:12.120 --> 33:13.000
groups.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.920
It comes from a tradition where you expect some people to be sacrificed for the greater

33:16.920 --> 33:18.040
good of the whole.

33:19.320 --> 33:28.760
I think it comes from a tradition where mysticism or revelation as the source of truth is accepted.

33:28.760 --> 33:31.720
I view Marx as, in some sense, very Christian.

33:32.360 --> 33:37.400
I don't think he's this radical, rejecting, I think he's just reformatting

33:38.120 --> 33:41.960
Christianity in a sense, he's replacing God with the proletarian.

33:43.160 --> 33:47.720
Knowledge, you have to get knowledge from somewhere, so you need the dictatorship of

33:47.720 --> 33:52.600
the proletarian, you need somebody, the Stalin, the Lenin, who somehow communes with the spirit

33:53.880 --> 33:54.760
of the proletarian.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.240
There's no rationality, not rationalism.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.840
There's no rationality in Marx.

33:59.480 --> 34:04.840
There is a lot of mysticism and there is a lot of hand waving and there's a lot of sacrifice

34:04.840 --> 34:07.800
and a lot of original sin in the way he views humanity.

34:08.600 --> 34:13.960
I view Marx as one more collectivist in a whole string of collectivists.

34:14.920 --> 34:23.960
I think the Bismarckian response, I know less about Disraeli, so I'll focus on Bismarck.

34:23.960 --> 34:29.480
Bismarck is really responding to political pressures from the left and he's responding

34:29.480 --> 34:32.600
to the rise of communism, socialism.

34:33.560 --> 34:37.400
What Bismarck is doing, he's putting something alternative.

34:37.400 --> 34:43.480
He's presenting an alternative to the proletarian as the standard by which we should

34:43.480 --> 34:44.200
matter the good.

34:45.720 --> 34:47.160
What he's replacing it is the state.

34:47.160 --> 34:52.120
He's replacing the proletarian with the state and that has exactly the same problems.

34:52.120 --> 34:56.120
That is, first, it requires sacrificing some to others, which is what the welfare state

34:56.120 --> 34:57.560
basically legitimizes.

34:59.080 --> 35:02.840
It places the state above all, so the state now becomes, I think, the biggest evil of

35:02.840 --> 35:08.440
Bismarck, and I definitely view him as a negative force in history, is public education.

35:09.080 --> 35:14.040
The Germans really dig in on public education and really develop it.

35:14.040 --> 35:20.920
Really, the American model of public education is copying the Prussian Bismarckian public

35:20.920 --> 35:21.240
education system.

35:21.240 --> 35:27.080
Can you speak to that real quick, why the public education is such a root of moral evil

35:27.080 --> 35:27.720
for you?

35:27.720 --> 35:34.040
Well, because it now says that there's one standard and that standard is determined by

35:34.040 --> 35:39.640
government, by a bureaucracy, by whatever the government deems is in the national interest.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.000
Bismarck is very explicit about this.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.600
He's training the workers of the future.

35:43.960 --> 35:48.520
They need to catch up with England and other places and they need to train the workers.

35:49.720 --> 35:52.680
He's going to train some people to be the managerial classes, he's going to train other

35:52.680 --> 35:53.400
people to be...

35:53.400 --> 35:57.480
And he decides that the government, the bureaucracy is going to decide who's who

35:57.480 --> 35:58.120
and where they go.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.400
There's no individual choice.

35:59.400 --> 36:04.840
There's no individual showing an ability to break out of what the government has decided

36:04.840 --> 36:05.720
is their little box.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.880
There's very little freedom.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.760
There's very little...

36:09.960 --> 36:11.800
Ultimately, there's very little competition.

36:11.800 --> 36:13.560
There's very little innovation.

36:13.560 --> 36:16.840
And this is the problem we have today in American education, which we can get to,

36:16.840 --> 36:18.520
is there's no competition and no innovation.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.080
We have one standard fit all.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.080
And then we have conflicts about what should be taught.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.320
And the conflict's now not pedagogical.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.160
They're not about what works and what doesn't.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.560
Nobody cares about that.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.240
It's about political agendas, right?

36:31.240 --> 36:35.480
It's about what my group wants to be taught and what that group wants to be taught

36:35.480 --> 36:38.760
rather than actually discovering how do we get kids to read?

36:38.760 --> 36:41.800
I mean, we all know how to get kids to read, but there's a political agenda

36:41.800 --> 36:43.400
around not teaching phonics, for example.

36:43.960 --> 36:48.280
So a lot of schools don't teach phonics, even though the kids will never learn how to read

36:48.280 --> 36:49.000
properly.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.760
So it becomes politics.

36:50.760 --> 36:53.240
And I don't believe politics belongs in education.

36:53.240 --> 36:54.600
I think education is a product.

36:54.600 --> 36:55.240
It's a service.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.000
And we know how to deliver products and services really, really efficiently,

36:59.000 --> 37:02.200
at a really, really low price, at a really, really high quality.

37:02.200 --> 37:04.440
And that's leaving it to the market to do.

37:04.440 --> 37:08.840
But your fundamental criticism is that the state can use education

37:09.720 --> 37:13.320
to further its authoritarian aims.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.840
Well, or whatever the aims.

37:14.840 --> 37:18.680
I mean, think about the conservative today, critique of American educational system.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.040
It's dominated by the left.

37:20.040 --> 37:20.600
Yeah.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.760
What did you expect, right?

37:23.640 --> 37:27.560
If you leave it up to the state to fund, they're going to fund the things that promote

37:28.280 --> 37:30.120
state growth and state intervention.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.400
And the left is better at that.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.480
It has been better at that than the right.

37:33.480 --> 37:36.520
And they now dominate our educational institutions.

37:36.520 --> 37:41.400
But look, if we go back to Bismarck, my problem is placing the state above the individual.

37:41.400 --> 37:46.440
So if communism places the class above the individual, what matters is class,

37:46.440 --> 37:47.240
individuals are nothing.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.200
They're cogs in a machine.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.920
Bismarck, certainly the German tradition, much more than the British tradition or the

37:52.920 --> 37:56.840
American tradition, the German tradition is to place the state above the individual.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.120
I think that's equally evil.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.640
And the outcome is fascism.

37:59.640 --> 38:00.760
And the outcome is the same.

38:00.760 --> 38:05.800
The outcome is the deaths of tens of millions of people when taken to its ultimate conclusion.

38:05.800 --> 38:09.880
Just like socialism, the ultimate conclusion of it is communism,

38:11.320 --> 38:14.520
nationalism in that form, kind of the Bismarckian form.

38:14.600 --> 38:19.080
The ultimate conclusion is Nazism or some form of fascism.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.520
Because you don't care about the individual.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.800
The individual doesn't matter.

38:23.800 --> 38:30.920
I think this is one of the differences in the Anglo-American tradition where the Anglo-American

38:30.920 --> 38:35.800
tradition, even the conservatives have always acknowledged and it goes back to-

38:35.800 --> 38:38.040
Especially the conservatives.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.400
The conservatives were there first.

38:39.400 --> 38:39.880
Yes.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.080
They acknowledged.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.080
You've defined conservatives to include all the good thinkers of the distant past.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.520
And they're all good thinkers.

38:46.520 --> 38:47.480
We agree on that.

38:47.480 --> 38:51.080
I'm defining conservatism the way that Burke does.

38:52.280 --> 38:53.880
Look, this is a very simple observation.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.480
Burke thinks when you open Burke and you actually read him,

38:57.480 --> 39:00.120
he starts naming all of these people who he's defending.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.080
And it's bizarre.

39:01.080 --> 39:01.560
I'm sorry.

39:01.560 --> 39:05.960
It's just intellectual sloppiness for people to be publishing books called Burke,

39:05.960 --> 39:08.200
the first conservative, the founding conservative.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.440
This is nonstop.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.840
It's a view that says Burke reacts to the French Revolution,

39:14.840 --> 39:16.680
so conservatism has no prior tradition.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.600
It's just reacting to the French Revolution.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.840
And this is just absurd.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.400
Can I ask a quick question on conservatism?

39:23.400 --> 39:27.240
Are there any conservatives that are embracing of revolutions?

39:27.240 --> 39:30.680
So are they ultimately against the concept of revolution?

39:30.680 --> 39:31.000
Yes.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.800
Burke himself embraces the Polish Revolution,

39:34.520 --> 39:37.800
which takes place almost exactly at the same time as the French Revolution.

39:38.360 --> 39:42.760
And the argument's really interesting because there's a common mistake is assuming that

39:42.760 --> 39:46.920
Burke and conservative thinkers are always in favor of slow change.

39:46.920 --> 39:49.720
I think that's also just factually mistaken.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.640
Burke is against the French Revolution because he thinks that there are actually tried and true

39:58.440 --> 40:02.040
things that work, things that work for human flourishing

40:02.040 --> 40:06.280
and freedom included as a very important part of human flourishing.

40:06.280 --> 40:16.120
And he, like many others, takes the English Constitution to be a model of something that

40:16.120 --> 40:17.720
works. So it has a king.

40:17.720 --> 40:22.360
It has various other things that maybe your own will say, well, that's a mistake.

40:22.360 --> 40:27.720
But still, for centuries, it's the leader in many things that I think we can easily agree

40:27.720 --> 40:29.080
are human flourishing.

40:29.080 --> 40:32.840
And Burke says, look, what's wrong with the French Revolution?

40:32.840 --> 40:38.120
What's wrong with the French Revolution is that they have a system that has all sorts of problems,

40:38.120 --> 40:40.680
but they could be repairing it.

40:40.680 --> 40:45.880
And instead, what they're doing by overthrowing everything is they're moving away from what we

40:45.880 --> 40:48.120
know is good for human beings.

40:48.120 --> 40:51.960
Then he looks at the Polish Revolution and he says the Poles do the opposite.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.840
The Poles have a non-functioning traditional constitution.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.360
It's too democratic.

40:56.840 --> 41:03.800
It's impossible to raise armies and to defend the country because of the fact that every

41:03.800 --> 41:04.920
nobleman has a veto.

41:05.560 --> 41:11.160
So the Polish Revolution moves in the direction of the British Constitution.

41:11.160 --> 41:16.200
They repair their constitution through a quick, rapid revolution.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.800
They install a king along the model that looks a lot like Britain.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.000
And Burke supports it.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.720
He says this is a good revolution.

41:23.720 --> 41:30.760
So it's not the need to quickly make a change in order to save yourself.

41:30.760 --> 41:33.000
That's not what conservatives are objecting to.

41:33.000 --> 41:40.280
What they're objecting to is instead of looking at experience in order to try to make a slow

41:40.280 --> 41:45.640
or quick improvement, a measured improvement to achieve a particular goal, instead of doing

41:45.640 --> 41:48.360
that, you say, look, the whole thing has just been wrong.

41:48.360 --> 41:52.280
And what we've really got to do is annihilate a certain part of the population and then make

41:52.280 --> 41:54.280
completely new laws and a completely new theory.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.280
That's what he's objecting to.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.480
That's the French Revolution.

41:57.480 --> 42:01.000
And that then becomes the model for communist revolutions.

42:02.360 --> 42:06.040
The French Revolution is clearly real evil and wrong.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.880
But it's not that it was a revolution.

42:07.880 --> 42:09.800
And it's not that it tried to change everything.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.960
Let's remember what was going on in France at the time.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.320
People were starving.

42:13.320 --> 42:18.520
And the monarchy in particular was completely detached, completely detached from the suffering

42:18.520 --> 42:19.160
of the people.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.600
And something needed to change.

42:21.320 --> 42:30.040
The unfortunate thing is that the change was motivated by an egalitarian philosophy,

42:30.040 --> 42:33.800
not egalitarian in a sense that I think the Fanny Fathers talked about, but egalitarian

42:33.800 --> 42:40.600
in a sense of real equality, quality of outcome, motivated by a philosophy, by Rousseau's philosophy.

42:40.600 --> 42:45.720
And inevitably, you could tell that the ideas were going to lead to this, to massive destruction

42:45.720 --> 42:48.120
and death and annihilation of a class.

42:48.520 --> 42:49.720
You can't.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.320
Annihilation is never an option.

42:51.320 --> 42:58.520
That is, it's not true that a good revolution never leads to mass death of just whole groups

42:58.520 --> 43:01.720
of people because a good revolution is about the sanctity of the individual.

43:01.720 --> 43:04.360
It's about preservation, liberty of the individual.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.440
And again, that goes back to...

43:06.440 --> 43:11.320
And the French Revolution denies, and Rousseau denies really, that in civilization there

43:11.320 --> 43:13.480
is a value and a thing called the individual.

43:13.480 --> 43:16.760
I think this is a good place to have this discussion.

43:17.720 --> 43:25.160
The Fanny Fathers of the United States, are they individualists or are they conservatives?

43:25.960 --> 43:31.160
So in this particular revolution that founded this country, at the core of which are some

43:32.040 --> 43:38.600
fascinating, some powerful ideas, were those Fanny Fathers, were those ideas coming from

43:38.600 --> 43:45.560
a place of conservatism or did they put primary value into the freedom and the power of the

43:45.560 --> 43:46.200
individual?

43:46.200 --> 43:46.760
What do you think?

43:47.400 --> 43:48.040
There were both.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.800
This is something that's a little bit difficult sometimes for Americans.

43:53.800 --> 43:58.280
I mean, even very educated Americans, they talk about the founding fathers as though

43:58.280 --> 44:06.360
it's kind of like this collective entity with a single brain and a single value system.

44:06.360 --> 44:12.280
But I think at the time, that's not the way any of them saw it.

44:12.280 --> 44:18.520
So roughly there's two camps, and they map onto the rationalist versus traditionalist

44:18.520 --> 44:21.160
empiricist dichotomy that I proposed earlier.

44:23.320 --> 44:28.680
So on the one hand, you have real revolutionaries like Jefferson and Payne.

44:28.680 --> 44:31.080
These are the people who Burke was writing against.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.480
These are the people who supported the French Revolution.

44:33.480 --> 44:35.640
So when you say real, so when you say Payne,

44:36.440 --> 44:40.120
you're referring to revolutionaries in a bad way, like this is a problem.

44:40.120 --> 44:48.040
These are people who will say history up until now has been, with Descartes, but applied

44:48.040 --> 44:55.160
to politics, history up until now has been just a story of ugliness, foolishness, stupidity,

44:55.160 --> 44:55.720
and evil.

44:56.280 --> 45:03.480
And if you apply reason, we'll all come to the same conclusions.

45:03.480 --> 45:06.520
And Payne writes a book called The Age of Reason.

45:06.520 --> 45:13.160
And The Age of Reason is a manifesto for here is the answer to political and moral problems

45:13.160 --> 45:14.040
throughout history.

45:14.040 --> 45:15.400
We have the answers.

45:15.400 --> 45:20.120
And it's in the same school as Rousseau's, the social, no, you don't like that?

45:20.120 --> 45:21.000
No, not at all.

45:21.000 --> 45:21.960
Oh, I thought it was the opposite.

45:21.960 --> 45:22.920
I think they're the opposites.

45:22.920 --> 45:23.880
Okay, so let me-

45:23.880 --> 45:27.480
Just to throw in a quick question on Jefferson and Payne.

45:28.120 --> 45:31.640
Do you think America would exist without those two figures?

45:32.520 --> 45:38.680
So like, how important is spice in the flavor of the dish you're making?

45:38.680 --> 45:40.760
I don't want to try to run the counterfactual.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.880
I don't have confidence that I know the answer to the question.

45:43.880 --> 45:44.840
But it's so much fun.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.920
You know what, I'm going to offer something that I think is more fun.

45:48.920 --> 45:55.160
More fun than the counterfactual is America had two revolutions, not one, okay?

45:55.240 --> 46:03.400
At first, there is a revolution that is strongly spiced with this kind of rationalism.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.160
And then there's a 10-year period after the Declaration of Independence.

46:09.160 --> 46:13.880
There's a 10-year period under which America has a constitution, its first constitution,

46:13.880 --> 46:16.040
which today they call the Articles of the Confederation.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.360
But there's a constitution from 1777.

46:19.160 --> 46:25.560
And that constitution is based on, in a lot of ways, on the hottest new ideas.

46:25.560 --> 46:31.080
It has, instead of the traditional British system with a division of powers between,

46:31.080 --> 46:36.840
you know, an executive and a bicameral legislature, instead of that traditional English

46:37.640 --> 46:41.640
model which most of the states had as their governments, instead of that they say,

46:41.640 --> 46:46.520
no, we're going to have one elected body, okay?

46:46.520 --> 46:50.120
And that body, that Congress, it's going to be the executive.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.640
It's going to be the legislative.

46:51.640 --> 46:55.640
It's going to be everything, and it's going to run as a big committee.

46:55.640 --> 46:57.320
These are the ideas of the French Revolution.

46:57.320 --> 47:03.720
You get to actually see them implemented in Pennsylvania, in the Pennsylvania Constitution,

47:03.720 --> 47:06.520
and then later in the National Assembly in France.

47:06.520 --> 47:07.640
It's a disaster.

47:07.640 --> 47:08.920
The thing doesn't work.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.040
It's completely made up.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.160
It's not based on any kind.

47:11.480 --> 47:15.640
It's neither based on historical experience nor is it based on historical custom, on what

47:15.640 --> 47:16.920
people are used to.

47:16.920 --> 47:23.080
And what they succeed in creating with this first constitution is it's wonderfully rational,

47:23.080 --> 47:24.680
but it's a complete disaster.

47:24.680 --> 47:27.240
It doesn't allow the raising of taxes.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.080
It doesn't allow the mustering of troops.

47:29.080 --> 47:32.840
It doesn't allow giving orders to soldiers to fight a war.

47:33.400 --> 47:40.680
And if that had continued, if that had continued to be the American Constitution,

47:40.680 --> 47:42.440
America never would have been an independent country.

47:42.440 --> 47:44.200
They aren't willing to do that counterfactual.

47:45.160 --> 47:55.640
What happens during those years where Washington and Jay and Knox and Hamilton and Morris,

47:55.640 --> 47:58.680
there's this group of conservatives.

47:58.680 --> 48:02.120
They're mostly soldiers and lawyers.

48:02.120 --> 48:05.560
Other than Washington, most of them are from northern cities.

48:06.200 --> 48:14.520
And this group is much more conservative than the Tom Paine and Jefferson School.

48:16.760 --> 48:19.000
Some historians call them the Nationalist Party.

48:19.960 --> 48:24.120
Historically, they give up the word nationalism and they call themselves the Federalists.

48:24.120 --> 48:26.040
But they're basically the Nationalist Party.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.080
What does that mean?

48:27.080 --> 48:31.960
It means on the one hand that their goal is to create an independent nation,

48:31.960 --> 48:33.080
independent from Britain.

48:33.080 --> 48:40.760
But on the other hand, they believe that they already have national legal traditions,

48:40.760 --> 48:46.200
the common law, the forms of government that have been imported from Britain,

48:46.200 --> 48:50.360
and of course Christianity, which they consider to be part of their inheritance.

48:51.480 --> 48:55.400
This Federalist Party is the Conservative Party.

48:56.440 --> 49:00.040
These are people who are extremely close in ideas to Burke.

49:00.200 --> 49:04.200
These are people who wrote the Constitution of the United States, the second constitution,

49:04.200 --> 49:11.480
the second revolution in 1787 when Washington leads the establishment of a new constitution,

49:11.480 --> 49:16.680
which may be technically legally, it wasn't even legal under the old constitution,

49:16.680 --> 49:17.880
but it was democratic.

49:18.520 --> 49:23.880
What it did is it said, we're going to take what we know about English government,

49:23.880 --> 49:27.080
what we've learned by applying English government in the states.

49:27.080 --> 49:30.680
We're going to create a national government, a unified national government

49:30.680 --> 49:34.600
that's going to muster power in its hands, enough power to be able to do things

49:34.600 --> 49:37.640
like fighting wars to defend a unified people.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.040
Those are conservatives.

49:40.040 --> 49:44.760
Now, it's reasonable to say, well, look, there was no king,

49:44.760 --> 49:46.120
so how conservative could they be?

49:46.120 --> 49:48.760
But I think that's a reasonable question.

49:48.760 --> 49:52.680
But don't forget that the American colonies, the English colonies in America,

49:52.680 --> 49:55.480
by that point had been around for 150 years.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.400
They had written constitutions.

49:57.400 --> 50:02.280
They had already adapted for an entire century, adapted the English constitution

50:02.280 --> 50:05.240
to local conditions where there's no aristocracy and there's no king.

50:06.040 --> 50:08.520
I think you can see that as a positive thing.

50:08.520 --> 50:09.880
On the other hand, they have slavery.

50:09.880 --> 50:10.840
That's an innovation.

50:11.400 --> 50:12.280
That's not English.

50:12.840 --> 50:15.000
So it's a little bit different from the English constitution,

50:15.000 --> 50:17.080
but those men are conservatives.

50:17.080 --> 50:21.800
They make the minimum changes that they need to the English constitution,

50:22.120 --> 50:28.440
and they largely replicate it, which is why the Jeffersonians hated them so much.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.040
They call them apostates.

50:30.040 --> 50:34.920
They say they've betrayed equality and liberty and fraternity

50:34.920 --> 50:37.640
by adopting an English-style constitution.

50:38.280 --> 50:43.160
So I would imagine, Yaron, you would put emphasis of the success of the key ideas

50:43.160 --> 50:47.240
at the founding of this country elsewhere, at the freedom of the individual.

50:47.240 --> 50:50.440
So as opposed to the tradition of the British Empire.

50:50.760 --> 50:53.640
The one thing I agree with, Yoram, is the fact that, yes,

50:53.640 --> 50:55.800
the founding fathers were not a monolith.

50:55.800 --> 50:59.720
They argued, they debated, they disagreed, they wrote against each other.

50:59.720 --> 51:03.160
I mean, Jefferson and Adams for decades didn't even speak to each other,

51:03.160 --> 51:07.800
though they did make up and had a fascinating relationship afterwards.

51:07.800 --> 51:08.760
You and I are making up, too.

51:08.760 --> 51:09.260
There you go.

51:10.360 --> 51:11.640
It's like the founding fathers.

51:12.760 --> 51:16.200
You know, there's massive debate and discussion,

51:17.080 --> 51:20.280
but I don't agree with the characterization of pain and Jefferson.

51:20.840 --> 51:23.000
I don't think it's just to call them rationalists,

51:23.000 --> 51:24.920
because I don't think they're rationalists.

51:24.920 --> 51:27.640
People who've looked at history, at the problems in history,

51:27.640 --> 51:30.120
and remember this is the 18th century,

51:30.120 --> 51:33.960
and they were coming out of a hundred years earliest

51:33.960 --> 51:36.040
on the bloodiest wars in all of human history,

51:36.040 --> 51:40.280
were happening in Europe, many of them over religion.

51:41.800 --> 51:45.160
You know, they had seen what was going on in France and other countries,

51:45.160 --> 51:52.840
where people were starving and where kings were frolicking in palaces in spite of that.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.960
They were very aware of the relative freedom

51:57.960 --> 52:01.640
that the British tradition had given Englishmen.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.640
I think they knew that, they understood that.

52:04.680 --> 52:06.200
And I think they were building on that.

52:06.200 --> 52:08.440
They were taking the observation of the past

52:09.160 --> 52:11.800
and trying to come up with a more perfect system.

52:12.360 --> 52:13.400
And I think they did.

52:13.720 --> 52:15.880
In that sense, I'm a huge fan of Jefferson.

52:16.520 --> 52:19.800
There are two things that I think are unfortunate about Jefferson.

52:19.800 --> 52:25.800
One is that he continued to hold slaves, which is very unfortunate.

52:25.800 --> 52:28.840
And the second is early support for the French Revolution,

52:28.840 --> 52:30.200
which I think is a massive mistake.

52:31.480 --> 52:36.440
And I wouldn't be surprised if you regretted it later in life, given the consequences.

52:36.440 --> 52:39.560
But they were trying to derive principles

52:39.560 --> 52:41.640
by which they could establish a new state.

52:41.640 --> 52:45.480
And yes, there was some, there was pushback by some,

52:45.480 --> 52:46.520
and there was disagreements.

52:46.520 --> 52:51.880
And the Constitution in the end is, to some extent, a form of compromise.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.520
It's still one of the great documents of all of human history.

52:54.520 --> 52:55.560
The Constitution?

52:55.560 --> 52:58.840
The Constitution, although I think it's inferior to the Declaration.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.920
I'm a huge fan of the Declaration.

53:00.920 --> 53:03.240
And I think one of the mistakes the conservatives makes,

53:03.240 --> 53:07.640
one of the mistakes the Supreme Court makes and American judiciary makes

53:07.640 --> 53:10.280
is assuming the two documents are separate.

53:10.280 --> 53:11.800
I think Lincoln is actually right.

53:11.800 --> 53:15.240
You can't understand the Constitution without understanding the Declaration.

53:15.240 --> 53:19.880
The Declaration would set the context and what sets everything up for the Constitution.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.960
Individual rights are the key concept there.

53:22.760 --> 53:26.280
And one of the challenges was that some of the compromises,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.560
and compromise is not necessarily between groups,

53:29.560 --> 53:33.960
but compromises that even Jefferson made and others made regarding individual rights,

53:35.080 --> 53:38.520
set America on a path that we're suffering from today.

53:39.160 --> 53:41.800
And I mentioned three last night.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.080
One was slavery.

53:43.080 --> 53:46.520
Obviously, that was a horrific compromise.

53:46.520 --> 53:50.440
One that America not just paid for with the Civil War,

53:50.440 --> 53:54.280
600,000 young men died because of it,

53:54.280 --> 53:57.880
but the suffering of black slaves for all those years.

53:57.880 --> 54:01.240
But then the whole issue of racial tensions in this country

54:03.240 --> 54:05.400
for a century to this day, really,

54:06.120 --> 54:08.120
is a consequence of that initial compromise.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.920
Who knows what the counterfactual is in America

54:11.480 --> 54:14.120
if there's a Civil War right at the founding,

54:14.120 --> 54:16.280
because there would have been a war no matter what.

54:16.280 --> 54:19.160
But if it had happened in the late 18th century, early 19th century,

54:19.160 --> 54:21.800
rather than waiting until 1860s.

54:21.800 --> 54:28.760
But then second was Jefferson's embrace of public education,

54:28.760 --> 54:30.360
his founding of the University of Virginia,

54:30.360 --> 54:32.360
which I think is a great tragedy,

54:34.200 --> 54:35.720
which nobody agrees with me on.

54:35.960 --> 54:38.840
So that's one of the areas where I'm pretty radical.

54:38.840 --> 54:42.920
And then they embrace both by Jefferson and by Hamilton

54:44.040 --> 54:45.080
for different reasons,

54:45.080 --> 54:49.000
but an embrace by both of them of government role in the economy.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.440
And I do finance, so I know a little bit about finance.

54:52.440 --> 54:56.600
And the debate between Jefferson and Hamilton about banking is fascinating.

54:56.600 --> 54:59.640
But at the end of the day, both wanted a role for government in banking.

54:59.640 --> 55:00.600
They both didn't trust.

55:01.640 --> 55:04.680
Jefferson didn't trust big financial interests.

55:04.760 --> 55:07.800
Hamilton wanted to capture some of those financial interests for the state.

55:07.800 --> 55:11.640
And as a consequence, we set America on a path where,

55:12.600 --> 55:14.840
in my view, regulation always leads to more regulation.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.160
There's never a case where regulation decreases.

55:17.160 --> 55:20.760
And we started out with a certain regulatory body around banks

55:20.760 --> 55:23.400
and a recognition that it was okay to regulate the economy.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.240
So once we get into the late 19th century,

55:25.240 --> 55:27.080
it's fine to regulate the railroads.

55:27.080 --> 55:29.320
It's fine to pass antitrust laws.

55:29.320 --> 55:32.760
It's fine to then continue on the path of where we are today,

55:32.760 --> 55:35.880
which is heavy, heavy, heavy, massive involvement of government

55:35.880 --> 55:38.280
in every aspect of our economy,

55:38.280 --> 55:41.240
and really in every aspect of our life because of education.

55:41.240 --> 55:44.840
So I think the country was founded on certain mistakes,

55:44.840 --> 55:48.200
and we haven't been willing to question those mistakes.

55:48.200 --> 55:51.480
And in a sense, we've only moved in the opposite direction.

55:52.040 --> 55:53.880
And now America has become,

55:55.320 --> 55:58.440
whereas I think it was founded on the idea of the primacy of the individual,

55:58.440 --> 56:00.200
the sanctity of the individual,

56:00.200 --> 56:02.840
at least there's an idea, even if not fully implemented,

56:02.840 --> 56:04.360
I think now that's completely lost.

56:04.360 --> 56:08.680
I don't think anybody really is an advocate out there

56:08.680 --> 56:12.760
for individualism in politics or for true freedom in politics.

56:12.760 --> 56:14.200
We'll get to individualism,

56:14.200 --> 56:16.600
but let me ask the Beatles and the Rolling Stones question

56:16.600 --> 56:19.000
about the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

56:20.440 --> 56:21.880
Because it's like, which document,

56:21.880 --> 56:24.280
Beatles are rolling, which document is more important?

56:24.280 --> 56:25.560
It's obviously the Beatles, right?

56:25.560 --> 56:26.060
Okay.

56:27.320 --> 56:28.360
Is there even a question?

56:28.360 --> 56:32.120
But let me then even zoom in further and ask you to pick your favorite song.

56:32.920 --> 56:37.320
So what ideas in the Constitution or the Declaration of Independence

56:37.320 --> 56:43.000
do you think are the most important to the success of the United States of America?

56:43.000 --> 56:44.040
I'll answer the question.

56:44.040 --> 56:45.960
But before answering the question,

56:45.960 --> 56:49.000
I want to register a dissent from your runs.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.440
Is it the public education?

56:50.440 --> 56:51.400
Is it which?

56:51.400 --> 56:51.880
No, no, no.

56:51.880 --> 56:56.840
Actually, we're not so far apart on public education.

56:57.640 --> 57:00.600
I'm actually kind of surprised that you're so anti-Bismarck

57:00.600 --> 57:02.760
because his public school system,

57:02.760 --> 57:07.000
his national public school system was created in order to stick it to the church.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.480
It was the church that ran the schools before then.

57:09.480 --> 57:10.920
And so that's a different-

57:10.920 --> 57:12.120
I'm all for sticking it to the church.

57:13.160 --> 57:15.880
Any opportunity, but not when the alternative is the nation.

57:15.880 --> 57:21.080
I'd rather say free educational system where freedom is in education.

57:21.080 --> 57:25.640
Okay. So I want to register a dissent about Lincoln.

57:26.120 --> 57:28.680
Lincoln is an important figure and a great man,

57:28.680 --> 57:30.600
and he was presiding over a country,

57:30.600 --> 57:35.640
which at that point was pretty Jeffersonian in terms of its self-perception.

57:35.640 --> 57:36.920
He said what he needed to say.

57:36.920 --> 57:38.440
I'm not going to criticize him,

57:38.440 --> 57:43.800
but I don't accept the idea that the Declaration of Independence,

57:43.800 --> 57:45.560
which starts one revolution,

57:47.080 --> 57:50.440
is of a piece with the Second Constitution,

57:50.440 --> 57:52.520
the Constitution of 1787,

57:52.520 --> 57:54.600
the Nationalist Constitution,

57:54.600 --> 57:57.720
which is effectively a counter revolution.

57:57.720 --> 58:00.120
What happens is there is a revolution.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.720
It's based on certain principles.

58:01.720 --> 58:03.400
There are a lot, not exactly,

58:03.400 --> 58:08.840
but in many ways resemble the later ideas of the French Revolution.

58:08.840 --> 58:10.520
And what the Federalist Party does,

58:10.520 --> 58:13.400
the Nationalist Conservative Party does,

58:13.400 --> 58:17.960
is a counter revolution to reinstate the Old English Constitution.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.480
So these documents are,

58:20.120 --> 58:22.600
if you're willing to accept the evidence of history,

58:22.600 --> 58:26.440
they are in many respects contrary to one another.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.480
And so if I'm asked what's the most important values

58:31.480 --> 58:33.960
that are handed down by these documents,

58:33.960 --> 58:39.480
I don't have an objection to life, liberty, and property,

58:39.480 --> 58:41.160
all of which are really important things.

58:41.160 --> 58:49.240
I do have an objection to the pompous overreach of these are self-evident,

58:49.240 --> 58:50.200
which is absurd.

58:50.200 --> 58:51.320
They can't be self-evident.

58:51.320 --> 58:52.280
If they were self-evident,

58:52.280 --> 58:55.640
then somebody would have come up with them like 2,000 years before.

58:55.640 --> 58:57.720
It's not self-evident.

58:57.720 --> 58:59.560
And so that's damaging.

58:59.560 --> 59:03.720
I like the conservative preamble of the Constitution,

59:04.440 --> 59:08.440
which describes the purposes of the national government

59:08.440 --> 59:09.560
that's being established.

59:10.280 --> 59:12.440
There are seven purposes.

59:13.480 --> 59:14.600
A more perfect union,

59:14.600 --> 59:20.120
which is the principle of cohesion, justice, domestic peace,

59:21.320 --> 59:23.880
common defense, the general welfare,

59:23.880 --> 59:27.400
which is the welfare of the public as a thing

59:27.400 --> 59:28.840
that's not only individuals,

59:28.840 --> 59:30.760
but there is such a thing as a general welfare.

59:31.480 --> 59:34.840
Liberty, which we agree is absolutely crucial.

59:34.840 --> 59:38.440
And posterity, the idea that the purpose of the government

59:38.440 --> 59:42.600
is to be able to sustain and grow this independent nation,

59:42.600 --> 59:45.560
and not only to guarantee rights no matter what happens.

59:45.560 --> 59:46.920
But you don't like the,

59:46.920 --> 59:49.640
we hold these truths to be self-evident.

59:49.640 --> 59:51.080
So you'd definitely be those guy.

59:51.080 --> 59:53.400
You don't want the pompous,

59:54.600 --> 59:56.280
you don't need that revolutionary strength.

59:56.280 --> 59:58.760
Look, I just, I think that that expression,

59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.760
self-evident truth, it does tremendous damage

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.000
because it, instead of a moderate skepticism,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.960
which says, look, we may not know everything,

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.360
it says, look, we know everything.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.960
Here it is, here's what we know, we know.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.360
We don't know everything, but we think.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.160
So I'll agree with you all.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.600
I don't like self-evident.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.600
I don't like self-evident because he's actually right.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.880
It's not self-evident.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.200
These are massive achievements.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.520
These are massive achievements of enlightened thinking,

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.880
of studying history, of understanding human nature,

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:39.800
of deriving a truth from 3,000 years of historical knowledge

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.240
and a better understanding of human nature and a capacity.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.440
It's using reason in some ways

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.920
better than any human beings have.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.560
I mean, the Founding Fathers are giants, historically,

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.840
in my view, because they came up with these truths.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:55.960
I do think they're truths,

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.560
but they're certainly not self-evident.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.720
I mean, if they were, your arm is right,

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.640
they would have discovered them thousands of years earlier,

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.400
or everybody would accept them, right?

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.880
I mean, how many people today think that those,

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.880
what they state in the document is true?

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.400
Pretty much, you know, five people, I don't know.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.800
It's very, it's very-

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.640
That's your criticism of modern society.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.440
Yes, we'll get there.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.680
It's very, very few people recognize it.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.920
If they were self-evident, bam,

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.880
everybody would have become,

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.040
would have accepted the American Revolution as truth,

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.080
and that was it.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.120
A lot of work has to go into understanding

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.000
and describing and convincing people about those truths.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But I completely disagree with your arm about this idea,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.560
or I'll voice my dissent, as we said.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.440
Register your official dissent.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.320
About A, this being two different revolutions,

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.840
and B, that the American Revolution

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.920
was at any similarity to the French Revolution.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.840
You know that Jefferson and Payne were,

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.640
they were in France, running a different revolution.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.120
I know, but they were writing constantly.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.200
I mean, they were in communication with Madison.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.720
There was a lot of input going on.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.880
I know, and Jefferson's sitting there in Paris,

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.680
pulling his hair out because Madison has come under

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.120
the influence of these nationalists,

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.000
and he can't believe it.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.240
The reality is that the difference

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.440
between the French Revolution

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:16.920
and the American Revolution is vast,

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.720
and it is a deep philosophical difference,

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.560
and it's a difference that expressed,

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:23.960
I think, between the differences.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.120
You know, Yoram, in his writings,

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.000
lumps Rousseau with Locke and with Voltaire

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.120
and with others, and I think that's wrong.

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.200
I think Rousseau is very different than the others.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.160
I think, again, Rousseau is an anti-enlightenment figure.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.880
Rousseau is, in many respects,

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.840
talking back to a past, an ancient past,

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.280
and I think a completely distorted view

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.440
of human nature, of human mind.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.800
He rejects reason.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.640
I mean, Rousseau is on the premise

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.120
that reason is the end of humanity.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.440
Reason is the destruction of humanity.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.360
Reason is how we get civilization,

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.040
and civilization is awful because-

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.200
I don't disagree.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.800
We're only talking about different texts.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.760
I'm just talking about the social contract.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.120
Yeah, but the social contract,

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.800
there's similarity between others,

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.720
but he takes it in a completely different direction,

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.440
and we agree social contract is a bad idea,

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.600
but you can't have a contract

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.240
that you don't actually voluntarily accept,

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.240
but Rousseau is the French Revolution.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.800
Rousseau is about destruction and mayhem and chaos and anarchy.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.920
He is the spirit behind the French Revolution.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:30.040
I think the American Revolution

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.480
is a complete rejection of Rousseau.

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.280
I think Jefferson is a complete rejection of Rousseau.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.120
I don't think Jefferson is a fan of Rousseau.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.600
He is a Voltaire, and he certainly is a Montesquieu.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.520
If you look at the Federalist Papers,

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.480
the intellectual most cited in the Federalist Papers,

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.560
I think in terms of just the number of times

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.760
he's cited, is Montesquieu.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.400
So I think that the American Revolution

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.080
is an individualistic revolution.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.160
It is a revolution about the rights of the individual.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.080
The French Revolution is a negation

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.120
of the rights of the individual.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.960
It's a collectivistic revolution.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.680
It's not quite the Marxist Revolution

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.960
of the proletarian, but it's defining people in classes,

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.240
and it's a rebellion against a certain class,

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.960
and yeah, kill them all, right?

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:12.760
Off with their heads.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.160
And it is a negation.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.280
It's about egalitarianism in the sense of equality of outcome,

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.520
not in a sense of equality before the law

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.400
or equality of rights, which is the Jeffersonian sense.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.840
So I think it's wrong to lump Jefferson

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:33.080
into the fraternity, egalitarian notion of the French,

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.600
which is far more similar to what ultimately became

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.960
socialism and Marxism and kind of that tradition.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.600
It's anti-individualistic, the French Revolution is,

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.360
whereas the American Revolution, the first one,

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.520
is individualistic.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.040
It's all about individual rights,

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.120
and while there's certain phrases

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.320
in the Declaration of Independence

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.840
that I don't agree with, it's beautifully written

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.120
and it's a magnificent document,

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.440
so it's hard for me to say I don't agree.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.560
Who am I, right?

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.840
These were giants, self-evident is one of them.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.440
I'm not particularly crazy about endowed by the creator,

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.280
but I like the fact that it's creator and not God

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.480
or not a specific creator,

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.800
but just kind of a more general thing.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.960
But putting those two ashes aside,

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.560
it's the greatest political document

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.720
in all of human history, in my view, by far.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.760
Nothing comes close.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.040
It is a document that identifies the core principles

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:33.880
of political truism, of truth.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.800
That is, the role of government is to preserve

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.080
and to protect these rights, these inalienable rights,

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.040
and that is so crucial that these rights are inalienable.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.200
That is, a majority can't vote them out,

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.080
a revelation can't vote them out.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.640
This is what is required for human liberty and human freedom.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.880
The right, that is, the sanction, the freedom

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.080
to act on your own behalf,

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.840
to act based on your own judgment,

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.240
and as long as you're not interfering

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.120
with other people's rights, you are free to do so.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.880
That is such a profound truth.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.800
And that, to me, is the essence of political philosophy.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.600
That's the beginning.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.480
And it's based on, just to not fall into,

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.800
you're all I'm gonna say, it's a rationalist.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.480
It's based on a whole history

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.080
of what happens when we negate that.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:23.240
It's based on looking at England

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.440
and seeing to the extent that they practiced

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.040
a respect for individual liberty,

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.720
a property of freedom, good things happened.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.200
So let's take that all the way.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.480
Let's not compromise on that.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.200
Let's be consistent with the good and reject the bad.

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.200
And when England goes away,

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.960
distance itself from the rights of man,

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.600
from the idea of a right to property and so on,

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.120
bad things happen.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.360
And when they go to, let's go all in.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.720
And I'm all in on the right to life, liberty,

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.400
property, and the pursuit of happiness.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.920
And I think the idea of pursuit of happiness

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.640
profound because it's a moral statement.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.440
It's a statement that says that sanctions

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.520
and says that ultimately people should be allowed

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.480
to make their own judgments and live their lives

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.240
as they see fit based on how they view happiness.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.440
They might be right, they might be wrong,

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:18.040
but we're not gonna dictate what happiness entails

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.520
and dictate to people how they should live their lives.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.560
We're gonna let them figure that out.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.960
So it has this self-interested moral code

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.240
kind of embedded in it.

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.000
So I think it's a beautiful statement.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.520
So I think the declaration is key.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.080
And I think there was an experiment

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:38.440
and the experiment was post in that period

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.960
before the constitution where the experiment was,

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.160
let's let the states,

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.560
let's have a kind of a loose confederation.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.280
Let's have the states experiment

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.440
with setting up their own constitutions

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.480
and role of government.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.800
And we won't have any kind of unity.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.160
And I think what they realized

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.400
and I think even Jefferson realized

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.680
is that that was not workable

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:02.120
because many of the states

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.920
were starting to significantly violate rights.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.840
There was nothing to unify.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.360
There was nothing to really protect

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.400
the vision of the declaration.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.560
You needed to establish a nation,

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.240
which is what the constitution does.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.360
It establishes a nation.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.240
But the purpose of that was

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.440
to put everybody under one set

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.080
of laws that protected rights.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.800
The focus was still on the protection of rights.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.560
And I agree with six of the seven

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:30.920
of the principles.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.120
Which did disagree with?

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:34.920
The common welfare,

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:36.280
the general welfare,

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.480
which I don't worry about.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.280
I think in the way the founders understood it,

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.880
I think I probably agreed with it.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.400
But it's such an ambiguous-

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.360
I'm sure you don't agree.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.320
Maybe I don't.

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:45.800
It's just-

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.200
Can you state the general welfare principle?

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.040
Well, the idea that part of the world of government

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.720
is to secure the general welfare.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.240
This is something we didn't get to

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.920
in the debate we really should have,

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.520
is the question of whether there is such a thing

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.480
as a common good or a public interest

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:06.280
or a national interest or a general welfare.

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.480
Do these words,

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.720
do these terms mean anything

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.280
other than the good of all of the individuals

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.080
in the country?

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.520
That's an important-

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.040
Yeah, so that's right.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:17.800
I object to it

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.760
because I think it's too easy to interpret it as.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.640
I interpret it as,

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.520
well, what's good for a general,

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.480
a group, a common,

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.120
people are just a collection of individuals.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.080
What's good for the individual

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.520
is good for the common welfare.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.480
But I understand that that's something

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.400
that is hard for people to grasp

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.840
and not the common understanding.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.120
I would have skipped the general welfare

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:41.480
in order to avoid the fact

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.080
that now the general welfare includes

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.080
the government telling you

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.840
what gender you should be assigned.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.840
So I would have wanted

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.040
to have skipped that completely.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.360
So I think the Constitution

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.360
is pretty consistent with the Declaration,

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.320
with a few exceptions,

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.120
the general welfare,

01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.520
but perfection is a difficult thing to find,

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.760
particularly for me politically.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.760
But it's a magnificent document,

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.400
the Constitution.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.840
It doesn't quite rise to the level,

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.800
I think, of the Declaration,

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.080
but it's a magnificent document

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.120
because, and this is the difference,

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.040
I think, between the English Constitution.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.240
Here's what I see as the difference.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.400
The difference is that the Constitution

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.800
is written in the context of

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.320
why do we have a separation of powers,

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:23.800
for example?

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.120
We have a separation of powers

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.320
in order to make sure that the government

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.200
only does what the government

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:28.840
is supposed to do.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.200
And what is the government supposed to do?

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.240
Well, fundamentally,

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.920
it's supposed to protect rights.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.040
I mean, all of those seven,

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.800
or at least six of the seven,

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.720
are about protecting rights.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.680
They're about protecting us

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.560
from foreign invaders.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.360
They're about protecting

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.360
peace within the country.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.840
They're about preserving

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.360
this protection of rights.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.040
And why do we have this separation?

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.400
So that we make sure

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.480
that no one of those entities,

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.080
the executive or the legislature,

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.440
judicial, can violate rights

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.400
because there's always somebody

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.440
looking over their shoulder.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.240
There's always somebody

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.840
who can veto their power.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.280
But there's a purpose to it.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.640
And that purpose is clearly

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.120
signified and characterized.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:04.760
And that's why I think

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:05.800
the Bill of Rights was written

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.440
in order to add to the clarification

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.720
of what exactly we mean.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:10.440
What is the purpose?

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.880
The purpose is to preserve rights.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.520
And that's why we need to

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.960
to elaborate with those rights.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.800
And Madison's objection

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.480
to the Bill of Rights was to say

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.440
not that he objected

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.240
to having protection of rights,

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.160
but to listing them

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.040
because he was worried

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:26.680
that other rights

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.960
that were not listed would not be.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.800
And his worry was completely justified

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.160
because it's exactly what's happened.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.520
It's like the only reason

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.560
we have free speech in America

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.760
is we've got it in writing

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.960
as a First Amendment.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.000
If we didn't have it in writing,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.600
it would have been gone a long time ago.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.880
And the reason we don't have,

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.480
for example, the freedom to

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.360
negotiate a contract,

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.000
independent government regulation,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.280
is that was not listed

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.280
as a right in the bill,

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.160
even though I think

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.120
it's clearly covered

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.000
under the Constitution

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.520
and certainly under the Declaration.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.040
So there was a massive mistake

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:56.920
done in the Bill of Rights.

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.760
They tried to cover it

01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.640
with the Ninth Amendment,

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.680
but it never really stuck.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:01.960
This idea that

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.760
non-enumerated rights

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.760
that are still in place.

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.720
So I don't see it

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.600
as a second revolution.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.680
I think it's a fix

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.320
to a flaw that happened.

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.720
It's a fix that allowed

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.400
the expansion

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.520
of the protection of rights

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.680
to all states

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.000
by creating a national entity

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.040
to protect those rights.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.480
And that's what ultimately led

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.680
to slavery going away.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.720
Under the initial agreement,

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:35.160
slavery would have been there

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:35.800
in perpetuity

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.560
because states were sovereign

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.920
in a way that under

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.960
the new Constitution,

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.600
they were not.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.160
And in a sense,

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.600
the Constitution sets in motion

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.040
the Declaration

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:44.920
and then the Constitution

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.240
set in motion the Civil War.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.440
The Civil War has to happen

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.400
because at the end of the day,

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.480
you cannot have some states

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.160
with a massive violation of rights.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.280
What's more from violation

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.560
of rights and slavery?

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.360
And some states

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.480
that recognize it's not,

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.800
it inevitably leads

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.080
to the Civil War.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.600
Jeroen was just saying that

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.360
other than the general welfare,

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.160
these principles

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.440
are about individual liberties.

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.120
I just don't think

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.320
you can read it that way.

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:10.600
The first stated purpose

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.600
of the Constitution of 1787

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.120
is in order to form

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.160
a more perfect union.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.840
A more perfect union,

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.000
it's describing

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.080
a characteristic of the whole.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.600
It is not a characteristic

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.280
of any individual.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.000
If you look at how

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.880
the individuals are doing,

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.760
you don't know

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.360
whether their union

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.960
is more or less perfect.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.680
So what they're doing

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.440
is they're looking

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:33.880
at the condition in which

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.640
in order to be able

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.240
to fight the Battle of Yorktown,

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.360
they have to,

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.000
somebody has to write

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:39.800
a personal check

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.440
in order to be able

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.400
to move armies.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.680
A more perfect union

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.520
is a more cohesive union.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.800
It's the ability to get

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.960
all of these different individuals

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.040
to do one focused thing

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.720
when it's necessary to do it.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.880
Well, it's more than that, right?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.920
So I agree with that.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.760
But for what purpose?

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.320
That is, and this is why,

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.320
this is why it's so hard

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.440
with these historical documents

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.040
because there's a context

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:04.920
and there's a thinking

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.520
they can't write everything down,

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:07.640
which is sad

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:08.440
because I wish they had.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.720
What's the purpose

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.160
of a more perfect union?

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.480
The purpose of the more perfect union

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:14.840
is to preserve the liberty

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.480
of the individuals

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.280
within that union.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:18.840
Because if you look,

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.800
what's the rest?

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.080
So what is the common defense?

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.360
The common defense is

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.240
is to protect us

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.360
from foreign invaders

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.960
who would now disrupt

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:27.320
what the rest of the Constitution

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:27.880
is all about.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.920
All of the Constitution

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.120
is written in a way

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.400
as to preserve,

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:32.760
find ways to limit

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.600
the ability of government

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.680
to violate the rights of individuals.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.400
That the beauty of this Constitution

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.280
and again,

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.880
its connection to the declaration

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.720
and tradition, right?

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.600
What came before it?

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.680
What came before it was a document

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:47.640
which they all respected,

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:49.080
which was the declaration,

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.600
which set the context for this.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.440
And now the union is there

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.240
in order to provide

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:54.440
for the common defense.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.880
Great, because we know

01:14:55.880 --> 01:14:56.760
that foreign invaders

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.880
can violate our rights.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.840
That's what war is about.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.080
To protect us from peace,

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.440
to establish peace and justice

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.640
within the country

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.160
that's based on law,

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.600
the rule of law and again,

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.320
individual liberty.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.000
So to me,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:11.960
when you read the founders,

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.160
when you read the federalist papers,

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.520
when you read what they wrote,

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.520
what they're trying to do

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:17.480
is figure out

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.400
the right kind of political system,

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.560
the right kind of structure

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.720
to be able to preserve

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.520
these liberties.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.280
And not all of them had a,

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.280
from my perspective,

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.080
perfect understanding

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.360
what those liberties entailed.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.480
But they were all,

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.600
even the conservatives

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:33.800
that you call conservatives,

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:35.160
were all in generally,

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.600
in agreement about

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.200
the importance of individual liberty

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.000
and the importance of individual-

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.440
Of course, because

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.200
almost all of these rights

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.800
are traditional English rights.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.560
They exist in the English bill of rights,

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.160
in the English petition of rights,

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.200
in the existence of forced-

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:48.840
Of course, of course.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.240
All of these are traditional-

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:49.960
And what they're trying to do

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.600
is perfect that.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.320
They're trying to take

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.160
the British system and perfect it.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:53.800
And what-

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.560
But you keep leaving out

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.520
that they want to be like England

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.400
and that they want to have

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.920
an independent nation.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.120
An independent nation

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.480
is not a collection

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.440
of individual liberties.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.040
An independent nation,

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:06.760
the first sentence

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.600
of the Declaration of Independence

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.560
is the declaration

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.000
that there is a collective right,

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.120
that we as a people

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.000
are breaking the bonds

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.280
with another people,

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.720
and we're going to take our place,

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.840
our equal station

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.280
among the nations of the earth.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.040
For what purpose?

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.080
The purpose is to protect

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:21.960
individual rights.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.000
And there's no collective rights.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.520
No, your argument

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.640
is completely circular.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.640
You're not allowing the possibility

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.920
that there could be,

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:29.800
that there could be

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.200
great and decent men

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:34.120
that you and I both admire

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.200
who wanted the independence

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.240
of their nation,

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.720
not because that would give

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.760
individuals liberty,

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.040
but because the independence

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.160
of their nation

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.000
was itself a great good.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.680
So we clearly disagree on this

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.800
because I don't think

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.840
the independence of the nation

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.280
is a good enough itself

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.240
because it's-

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.680
But do they think it was?

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.960
I don't think they did.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.720
And this is why they tried so hard

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.240
not to break from England

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.600
and why many of them,

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.720
many of them struggled,

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.320
really, really struggled

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.680
with having a revolution

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.720
because England was pretty good.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.880
England was the best.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.520
And this is where

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:09.960
we should get to

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.320
the universality of these things

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.520
because I do think England

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.360
was the best universally

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.960
and absolutely

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.800
was the best system out there.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.040
And they struggled to break

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:20.520
from England

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.560
because they didn't view

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.720
the value of having a nation

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.760
as the primary.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.600
But what they identified in England

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.080
is certain flaws in the system

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.200
that created situations

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.000
in which their rights

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.280
were being violated.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.760
So they figured the only option

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.280
in order to secure these rights

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.360
is to break away from England

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.160
and secure a nation.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.720
Now, I am not an anarchist as-

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.000
Michael Malice says

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.280
because we've discussed it.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.560
I believe you need nations.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.240
You need nations

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.680
to secure those rights.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.360
That is, the rights are not-

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.480
You can't secure those rights

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.840
without having a nation.

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.440
But the nation is just a means

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.000
to an end.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.360
The end is the rights.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.240
And I think that's how

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.360
the founders understood it.

01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.960
And that's why they created

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:00.760
this kind of country.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.440
I think this is a good place

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.640
to ask about

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.320
common welfare and cohesion.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.960
Let me say what John Donne wrote

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:11.400
that, quote,

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.600
No man is an island

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.640
entire of itself.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.760
Every man is a piece of the continent,

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.720
a part of the main.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.000
He went on,

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.720
Any man's death diminishes me

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.440
because I am involved in mankind.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.640
And therefore,

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.760
never sent to know

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.200
for whom the bell tolls.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.040
It tolls for thee.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.440
So, let's talk about individualism

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.040
and cohesion.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.480
Not just at the political level,

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.240
but at a philosophical level

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:42.440
for the human condition.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.840
What is central?

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.320
What is the role of other humans

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:48.920
in our lives?

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.920
What's the importance of cohesion?

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.840
This is something you've talked about.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.560
So, Iran said that the beauty

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.400
of the founding documents

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.960
is that they create a cohesive union

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.760
that protects the individual freedoms.

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.840
But you have spoken about

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.760
the value of the union,

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:09.080
the common welfare,

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.040
the cohesion in itself.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.840
So, can you maybe elaborate on

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:18.040
what is the role of cohesion

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.480
and the collective,

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:20.520
not to use that term,

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.600
but multiple humans together,

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.760
connected in the human condition?

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:25.720
Sure.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.840
I keep getting the feeling

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.760
that Yaron and I are actually having

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.040
a disagreement about empirical reality

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.400
because I think that enlightenment,

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:34.760
rationalist, political thought

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.240
features the individual.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:39.720
It features the state.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.200
There isn't really a nation

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.120
other than the nation,

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.960
the people as a collective

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.120
is created by the state.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.640
And when the state disappears,

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.000
then the collective disappears.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:53.720
Now, I think that when conservatives

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.880
of all stripes look at this kind of thinking,

01:19:58.440 --> 01:19:59.720
that there's the individuals

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.680
and then there's the state,

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.160
and there really isn't anything else.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.680
When they look at that,

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:08.840
they say even before you get to consequences,

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.040
it's a terrible theory

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.520
because when we try to understand

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:13.640
any field of inquiry,

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.880
any domain, any subject area,

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:17.160
when you try to understand it,

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.160
we try to come up with

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.960
a small number of concepts

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.080
and of relations among the concepts,

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:30.440
which is supposed to be able to explain,

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.720
to illuminate as much as possible

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.160
the important things

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.520
that are taking place in the domain.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.920
And conservatives look at this,

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.600
individuals and the state,

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.200
and they say you're missing

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.080
most of what's going on in politics,

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.080
also in personal human relations as well.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:51.800
But it just doesn't look

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.320
like a description of human beings.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.480
It looks like a completely artificial thing.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.360
And then conservatives say,

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.720
well, look, once you adopt

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:58.760
this artificial thing,

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.280
then the consequences are horrific

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.880
because you're not describing reality.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:05.560
So a conservative reality begins

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.680
with an empirical view

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.160
of what are human beings like.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.080
And the first thing you notice

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:13.960
about human beings,

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.320
or at least the first thing

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.000
I think conservatives notice,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.360
is that they're sticky,

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.400
is that they clump,

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.520
they turn into groups.

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.000
And you take any arbitrary collection

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
of human beings

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.280
and set them to a task,

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.040
or even just leave them alone.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.960
And they quickly form into groups,

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:33.080
and those groups are always

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.520
structured as hierarchies.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:35.720
This is this competition

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.840
within the hierarchy,

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:37.640
who's going to be the leader,

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.080
who's going to be number two.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.560
But everywhere you look

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:42.680
in human societies,

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:46.360
universally there are groups,

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.720
the groups compete,

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.720
and they're structured internally

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.360
as hierarchies,

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.280
and then there are internal competitions

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.720
for who leads the different groups.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.280
And when we think about

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:57.560
scientific explanation,

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.680
we allow that there are

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.560
different levels of explanation,

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.400
that a macroscopic object,

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.520
like a table,

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.960
it doesn't have properties

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.600
that can be directly derived

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.440
from the properties of the atoms,

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.160
or the molecules,

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.920
or the microfibers

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:13.960
that make up the table.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.440
And that's understood,

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.080
that there's what

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.720
academic philosophers call

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.760
emergent properties,

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.640
that when you get up

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.080
to the level of the table,

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.120
it has properties,

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.080
like that you can't

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.520
put your fist through it,

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.200
which you can't necessarily know

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.120
just by looking at the atoms alone.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.280
And I think conservatives say

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:33.240
the same thing is true

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.360
for political theory,

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.240
for social theory,

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:37.640
that looking at

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:39.240
an individual human being,

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:40.040
and thinking about

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:42.440
what does that individual human being need,

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.680
which Huron does very eloquently

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.400
in his writings.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:47.560
But that doesn't tell you

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.560
what the characteristics are

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.720
of this hierarchically

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.080
structured group.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.840
As soon as you have that,

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.440
it has its own qualities.

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.960
So an example,

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.080
the question of what holds

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.520
these groups together.

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:02.120
And we need to answer that question.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:05.320
I try to answer it by saying

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.920
there's such a thing as mutual loyalty.

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.160
Mutual loyalty is shorthand for

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.000
human beings.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.160
Individuals have the capacity

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.240
to include another individual

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.120
within their self,

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.000
within their conception of their self.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.680
When two people do it,

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.320
it creates a bond,

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.120
like a bond between two atoms

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:27.400
creates a molecule.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:27.960
That doesn't mean

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.480
that they lose their individuality.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:31.400
Within the group,

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:32.360
they may still continue

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.400
competing with one another.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:34.520
But that doesn't mean

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.560
that there isn't,

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.320
in reality, a bond.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.000
And that real bond

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.840
is the stuff of which

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:42.360
political events

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.760
and political history are made,

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.200
is the coming together,

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.480
the cohesion,

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:48.680
and the dissolution

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.920
of these bonded loyalty groups.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.640
That's the reality of politics.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.800
And so when I

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.400
hear these discussions

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.000
about individuals in the state,

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.080
I feel like we're missing

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.520
most of the reality.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.800
And in order to understand

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.840
the political reality,

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.360
we need to understand

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.680
what makes human beings

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:09.720
coherent to groups,

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:11.720
what makes them dissolve,

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.560
what makes the groups come apart

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:15.480
and end up creating civil wars

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.360
and that kind of thing.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.640
I think we also need to know

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.640
in practice,

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.520
rival groups do come together

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.560
and bond.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.920
I mean, basically,

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.800
when we think about

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.200
democratic society,

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.640
we're talking about

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:33.400
different groups.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.680
We can call them tribes,

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:35.240
or you can come up

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:35.960
with a different name.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.280
But different tribal groupings

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.560
with different views,

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:40.440
they come together

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.480
to form a nation.

01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.120
And they're able to do that,

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.360
even though often they hate each other,

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.280
like we were talking about

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.240
the American Revolution.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.000
And often they hate each other.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:51.800
And nevertheless,

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.080
they're able to come together.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:53.880
Why? How?

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.520
And that leads us into questions

01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.160
like how does honor,

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.200
the giving of honor

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.480
by one group to another,

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.040
how does that increase

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.440
the mutual loyalty

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.240
between groups

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.760
that are still competing

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:09.480
with one another?

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.560
All of these questions,

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.800
I think we have to answer them

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:14.440
in order to be able

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.640
to talk about politics.

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.640
And I think the reason,

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.400
the first reason why

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.760
one should approach politics

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:23.720
as a conservative

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.480
rather than as an individualist

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.200
is because it gives us

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.760
these theoretical tools

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.440
to be able to talk about reality,

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:31.080
which we don't have

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.440
as long as we keep

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.200
within the individualist framework.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.400
As you're talking,

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:36.840
the metaphor that's popping up

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.120
into my mind,

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.120
and this is also something

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.240
that bothers me

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:42.440
with theoretical physics.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:43.960
The metaphor is,

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.280
there's some sense in which

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.400
there's things called

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.680
theories of everything.

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:50.680
We try to describe

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:51.960
the basic laws of physics,

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.400
how they interact together.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.280
And once you do,

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.000
you have a sense

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.760
that you understand all of reality.

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.000
In a sense, you do.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.040
And that to me,

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.040
that to me is understanding

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.080
the individual,

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.840
like how the individual

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:05.960
behaves in this world.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.320
But then you're saying

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.840
that they're, hey, hey,

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:09.880
you're also forgetting

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.120
chemistry, biology,

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:12.920
how all of that

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.200
actually comes together,

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:14.920
the stickiness,

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.640
the stickiness of molecules

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.440
and how they build

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.320
different systems.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.520
And some systems

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.400
can kill each other.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.480
Some systems can flourish.

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:26.120
Some can make pancakes and bananas

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.880
and some can make poison

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.840
and all those kinds of things.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.200
And we need to be able to,

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:31.160
we need to consider

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.040
the full stack

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.240
of things that are constructed

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:38.840
from the fundamental basics.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.040
And I guess you're on,

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.000
you're saying that no,

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:45.800
you're just like

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:47.240
the theoretical physicist.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.920
It all starts at the bottom.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:51.000
Like if you need to preserve

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.920
the fundamentals of reality,

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:55.160
which is the individual,

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.760
like the basic atom

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.480
of human society

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.000
is the individual to you.

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.240
So yes, so the basic unit,

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.440
the basic moral unit,

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.960
the basic ethical unit

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.800
in society is the individual.

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.240
And yeah, of course we form groups.

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.880
And you can't understand history

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.080
unless you understand

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:13.880
group formation

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.160
and group motivation.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:17.160
And I have a view

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.120
about what kind of groups

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:18.840
should be formed.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.160
And politically,

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.520
from a political perspective,

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.800
voluntary ones,

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:25.960
ones in which we join

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:26.840
when we want to join

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.400
and we can leave

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.520
when we want to leave.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.720
And ones that help us

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.720
and clearly groups help us

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.120
pursue whatever it is

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.520
our goal is ultimately.

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:39.800
So in the pursuit of happiness,

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.320
there are lots of groups

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.360
that one wants to form,

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.280
whether it's marriage,

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.320
whether it's businesses,

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.400
whether it's sports teams,

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.600
whether it's lots of,

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.560
there are lots of different groups

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.200
one wants to form.

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.800
But the question is

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.960
what is the standard of well-being?

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.720
Is it the standard well-being

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.600
some algorithm

01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.480
that maximizes

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.840
the well-being of a group,

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.120
some utilitarian function?

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:07.240
Is it something

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.680
that's inherent in the group

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.840
that we can measure as goodness

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.440
and to help with the individuals within

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.480
as long as we can get that

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.640
the group to function well?

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.280
We don't really care

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.160
about where the individuals are.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.400
So to me, the goal of creating groups

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.160
is the well-being of the individual.

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.600
And that's why it needs to be voluntary

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:25.720
and that's why there has to be

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.240
a way out of those.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.680
Sometimes it's costly.

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:29.800
It's not a cheap out.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.840
That's why you should really think

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.160
about what groups you and this,

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:33.960
you know, on an issue

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.000
that's very controversial.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.840
Maybe we can discuss, maybe not.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.040
This is why to me,

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.560
immigration is so important, right?

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.880
Open immigration or free immigration

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:43.240
is because that's another group

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.360
that I would like people

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.800
to be able to voluntarily choose

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.480
both in and out.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:48.760
And I'd like to see people

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.680
be able to go and join

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.280
that group that, you know,

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.880
that they believe will allow

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:55.000
for the pursuit of happiness.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.120
But let me say that, you know,

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.840
that's a description of an ideal,

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.040
what I'm just saying, right?

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.400
I recognize that that's not

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.600
the reality in which we live.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.160
I recognize that that's not the reality

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.200
in which history, history, you know,

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.480
recognizing that such as

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.080
that the individual exists

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.360
in a sense philosophically

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.120
is a massive achievement, right?

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.200
You know, human beings,

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.480
however they evolved,

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.160
clearly we started out

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.080
in a tribal context

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.760
in which the individual didn't matter.

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.120
We followed the leader.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.960
The competition was for power,

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.160
power over the group

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.560
and dictates how the group should work.

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:33.240
You know, the history of human beings

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.080
is a history of gaining knowledge

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.520
and part of the knowledge is

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.080
the value of an individual.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.240
And you can see that in religion,

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.760
you can see that in philosophy,

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.000
you can see that through the evolution.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.200
And then, you know,

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.320
we evolved from tribes into nations

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.400
and then empires and conflicts

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.840
between nations and conflicts

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.560
between empires.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.480
And we tried a lot of different things,

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:55.960
if you will.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.560
I don't think we always did it on purpose,

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.440
but we kind of did different philosophies,

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:01.560
different sets of ideas

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.760
drove us towards different collectives,

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:05.960
different groupings

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.960
and different ways in which to structure.

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.360
And after, I don't know,

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.520
3000 years of kind of known history,

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.040
it's history before that,

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.240
but we don't know much about it,

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.920
3000 years of known history,

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.440
you can sit back and evaluate.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.360
And I think that's what

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.040
that's what is done in the Enlightenment.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.640
And you sit back

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:24.920
and suddenly we can do it today.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.840
We can sit back and evaluate

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.280
what promotes human flourishing

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.160
and what doesn't.

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:30.680
And what do we mean by human flourishing?

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:32.600
Who's flourishing?

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.600
Well, individual human beings.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.240
Now, since I don't believe in a zero-sum world

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.760
and the world is not zero-sum,

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.320
we can see that it's empirically possible

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:43.240
to show that the world is not a zero-sum game.

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.320
My flourishing doesn't come at your expense.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.360
So I can show that a system

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.400
that promotes my flourishing

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:50.920
will probably promote your flourishing as well

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.240
and promotes the general welfare in that sense,

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:57.160
because it promotes individuals flourishing.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:01.240
And we can look at all these examples

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:02.040
of how we evolved

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.160
and what leads to bloodshed

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:03.960
and what doesn't

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:06.440
and what promotes this ability

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.720
to flourish as an individual.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:08.840
Again, an achievement,

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.280
the idea of individual flourishing.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.440
And then we can think about

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:15.240
how to create a political system around that,

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:18.360
a political system that recognizes

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.080
and allows for the formation of groups,

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.640
but just under the principle of voluntary.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.720
So you can't be forced to join a group.

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.880
You can't be coerced into forming a group

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.360
other than the fact that you're born

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.400
in a particular place,

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.400
in a particular, you know, that in a sense.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:34.200
But that's not forced.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.840
There's a difference between metaphysics

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:37.880
and between choices.

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.000
So this is something that came up

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.840
in the debate that Yoram said

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.240
that not all human relations are voluntary.

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.280
And you kind of emphasize

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:48.040
that a lot of where we are is not voluntary.

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:49.080
We're grounded.

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.640
We're connected in so much.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.040
So how can a human be free

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.200
in the way you're describing,

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.560
individual be free

01:31:57.560 --> 01:32:01.960
if some part of who we are is not voluntary,

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.120
some part of who we are is other people?

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.360
Well, because what do we mean by freedom?

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.320
Freedom doesn't mean

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.520
and the negation of the laws of physics, right?

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.000
Freedom doesn't mean ignoring.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:16.600
Freedom means the ability

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.440
within the scope of what's available

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.400
for you to choose,

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:20.920
being able to choose those things.

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:25.080
So in a political context,

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:29.880
freedom means the absence of coercion.

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.560
So once you're an adult,

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:33.880
Yoram says you're born

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.280
into a particular religious context.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:36.760
Absolutely.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:37.640
But once you're an adult,

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.760
I think it's incumbent on you

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:40.840
to evaluate that religious context

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.840
and look at different religions

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.760
or non-religion or whatever

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:47.080
and choose your philosophy of life,

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.280
choose your values,

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.120
choose how you want to live your life.

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:50.920
That's the freedom.

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.560
The freedom is one system says

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.320
you're either cursed by the state

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.520
or cursed by the group

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:00.360
or cursed by society around you

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:01.480
to follow a particular path

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:06.040
or the expectation is,

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:06.920
the demand is,

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.320
the pressure is to conform

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.680
to a particular path.

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:12.280
And my view is no,

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.400
you should be in a position

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.920
to be able to choose your path.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.680
And that choice means

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:17.480
you look around,

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.040
you evaluate,

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.400
you evaluate based on history,

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.360
based on knowledge,

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.040
based on all of these things,

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.640
and you choose what that path would be.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:28.600
That's fundamentally what freedom means.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:30.520
Yes, you cannot choose your parents,

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:31.640
but of course not.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.840
Nobody would claim

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.960
that that's within the scope

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:34.680
of what is possible.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:39.400
I think the coercion freedom dichotomy,

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.200
these are too few concepts.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.320
Coercion and freedom,

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.680
it's too simplistic

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:45.640
to be able to describe

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:46.840
what we're actually dealing with.

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.520
The traditional Anglo conservative view

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:54.200
is that society has to be,

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:56.520
it has to be ordered,

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:57.800
it has to be disciplined.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.600
And there are two choices

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.240
for how it can be ordered.

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.880
One is that a people is,

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.680
by its own traditions,

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.040
you would say voluntarily,

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.120
but these are mostly inherited traditions.

01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.800
By its own traditions,

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.440
it is ordered.

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.480
For example, people just in general

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:22.280
will not go into somebody else's yard

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.040
because that's the custom here

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:25.800
is we don't go into somebody else's yard

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:27.160
without their permission.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.280
And so Fortescue,

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.160
we're talking about 500 years ago already.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.920
So Fortescue says

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.920
that the genius of the English people

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.560
is that our government can be mild

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:40.280
and apply very little coercion

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:42.680
because the people are so disciplined.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:44.440
Now when he says the people are so disciplined,

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.640
what he's saying is

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.800
is that our nation,

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.920
our tribes,

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.840
we have strong traditions

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.360
which channel people

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.640
through tools of being honored

01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:58.920
and dishonored.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.920
Now that's a reality

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.760
that exists in every society

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.360
and it's not captured

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.160
by your distinction

01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:07.080
between coercion and lack of coercion.

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:10.360
When I'm going to be dishonored

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:15.160
if I don't care for my aging mother,

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.440
I'm not being coerced

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.280
like the state comes and puts a gun to my head,

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.600
but I am being pressured

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.680
and given guidelines.

01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:23.960
But I'm saying that's wrong

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:25.640
and I'm saying that's dangerous

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.040
because that could easily be used

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.040
for bad traditions.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.080
I know, of course it is.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.680
Well, but what's the standard

01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.640
by which we evaluate

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.320
what a good tradition is a bad tradition.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:38.280
It's the English.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.800
You're getting to the standard too fast.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.280
Wait, wait.

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.200
You're getting to the standard too fast.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.600
First I want to know factually

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.840
is it true that all societies work like this

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.560
because if it's true

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:48.760
that all societies work like this

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.760
then saying we should be free from it

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.880
is just a fantasy.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.240
No, so A, I don't think

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:54.600
all societies work like this.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.920
I think much of what happened in America

01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.520
post-founding in the 19th century

01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.240
didn't work like that.

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.080
I think that's the genius of America

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.280
and I think what happened

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.160
during the 19th century

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.520
in the Industrial Revolution,

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:07.240
what happened in the 19th century

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:08.280
to some extent globally

01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.560
but certainly in the United States

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:10.760
didn't work that way.

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.880
It broke tradition.

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:14.200
I think all innovation breaks tradition

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:15.720
and I think that's what the genius

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.080
of this country is

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:20.280
and the post-enlightenment world is.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.080
I think pre that tradition

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:24.280
they work that way

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.560
and then the question is

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.680
do people understand why

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.400
they do what they do?

01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.080
That is, I don't want people doing

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.280
what I think is right

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.920
just because I think it's right

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.480
and I've created a society

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:41.960
in which somebody founded this country

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:42.600
in a particular way

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.480
so we're just going to follow.

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.360
I want people to understand

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.080
what they're doing.

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:45.880
So I want people to have

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:46.920
a respect for property

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.360
not because it's a tradition

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.880
but because they understand

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.120
the value of a respect for property.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.760
I want people not to murder one another

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.360
not because it's a commandment

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.480
that shall not murder

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.480
but because they have an understanding

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.160
of why murdering is bad

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:03.640
and wrong and bad for them

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.760
and bad for the kind of world

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:05.640
that they want to live in.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.440
And I think that's what we achieve

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:09.640
through enlightenment

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:11.080
through education

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.120
and where we don't treat people

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:17.160
just as a blob tribe

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.680
that just follows orders

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.120
but we now treat individuals

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:21.800
as capable of thinking for themselves

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:24.040
capable for discovering truth

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.200
capable of figuring out

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:27.400
their own values

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.600
and that's the big break between

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.640
and this is why

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.680
you know this is the break

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:34.760
I think that the declaration represents

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.520
the break between society

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:37.720
that is based on tradition

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.680
following commandments

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:39.640
following rules

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:41.240
because they are the rules

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.360
because they are the commandments

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.840
and a society where individuals

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.120
understand those rules

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.560
understand yes

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:48.680
it's now become a tradition

01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:50.840
let's say to respect the individual right

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.200
to respect property rights

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.400
but it's they're not following it

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.600
because it's a tradition

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:55.400
they're following it

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:56.600
because they understand

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:57.960
what it is about it

01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.880
that makes it good.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.040
So that's the world I think

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:03.640
that we were on the process

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.840
of evolving towards

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:07.080
and that is what got destroyed

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.200
in the 20th century

01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:10.760
and has certainly disappeared today

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.200
and I think that's a great tragedy

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.800
is that we're evolving to a place

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:14.840
where people understood

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:18.200
the values that represent

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:19.800
of course the danger with tradition

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.680
is I mean well agree right

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:25.640
it's yeah it's okay to kill the Jew right

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:27.720
or it's okay to steal people's property

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.240
if they're of a certain color

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.280
okay to enslave

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.800
those are all traditions

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.200
and yet once you stop and say

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.320
but what are they based on

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:37.000
what is this right

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.120
is this just based on some moral law

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:42.120
no it's not

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.400
there's something wrong here

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:44.600
we can't achieve happiness

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.120
and success if we follow these

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.400
you're talking about reason

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.200
and tradition

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.400
but I think I would love

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:50.760
to sort of linger on the

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.440
on the stickiness of humans

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.240
that you describe

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:55.320
so you kind of said

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.160
that it's primary the individuals

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.720
is primary and that was a great invention

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.560
but to me it's not at all obvious

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:02.920
that somehow

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:07.480
that the invention

01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:09.160
that humans have been practicing

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:11.400
for a very long time

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.360
of the stickiness

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.560
of community

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.440
of family

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.120
of love

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.400
it's that's not obvious to me

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.200
that's not also fundamental

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:25.800
to human flourishing

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.320
and should be celebrated

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.560
and protected

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.040
now the I suppose

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.880
the argument you're making is

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:35.640
when you start to let

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:39.400
the state define what the stickiness

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:40.600
how the stickiness looks

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.560
between humans

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:42.520
so you're really like

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.280
the voluntary aspect

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:46.200
but I just want to sort of

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.520
the observation is

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.560
humans seem to be pretty happy

01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.720
when they form communities

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:56.360
however you define that

01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:57.880
so romantic partnership

01:39:57.880 --> 01:39:58.440
family

01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.560
communities

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.520
some communities

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:01.000
people are

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:01.960
people are miserable

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:02.680
in other communities

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:03.960
so the nature of the community

01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:04.840
matters right

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:05.480
we know this

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.360
we know that

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.720
that some bondings

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.600
are not healthy

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:09.240
and not good

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.440
for the individuals involved

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.640
and they don't thrive

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:14.840
so I absolutely

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.800
I mean I'm a lover

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.360
not a fighter

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.040
right so I'm a huge believer in love

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.320
the whole philosophy

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.360
I think is a

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.960
is a love-based philosophy

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.080
I fight in order to love

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.120
so it's

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.080
love is at the core of all of this

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:29.960
and it's a love of life

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.120
it's a love of the world out there

01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:33.800
and it's a love of other people

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.640
because they represent a value to you

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.320
so the stickiness is there

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.480
it's you know my point is

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:42.520
A it should be chosen

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.600
it should be consciously chosen

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:45.480
and this is I'm

01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.280
put aside the state

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:47.800
forget the state for a minute

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:49.000
forget corrosion

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:49.640
forget all that

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.120
what I would encourage

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:53.320
individuals to do

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.360
and this is where

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.320
you know I'm

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.080
I'm not primarily a political

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.600
you know interested in politics

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:00.360
although I tend to talk

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.320
most about that

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.080
I'm primarily interested in human beings

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:03.880
and how they live

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.480
in a sense in morality

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:07.720
and what I would urge individuals to do

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.600
is to think about their relationships

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.480
to choose the best relationships possible

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.960
but to seek out great relationships

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.160
because other human beings

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.840
are an immense value to us

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:21.160
and you know

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:21.960
when I write

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:24.600
maybe you unquoted this or not

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:25.960
but I write that

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.960
you know about the trader principle in trading

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.200
you know it's easy

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.280
and obvious to think of it

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.880
as a materialistic kind of thing

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.840
you know I get

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:37.080
you know I do the choice this day

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.280
my wife does the choice the other day

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:39.240
we're trading

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.240
but trading is much more subtle than that

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:41.720
and much more

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.480
can be much more spiritual than that

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.960
it's about the trading in emotions

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.640
it's about the way

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.480
one sees each other

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.640
what one gets from one another

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:55.560
I think friendship is a form of trade

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:58.360
now I know that that seems to make it material

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.440
but I don't think it's of trade

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:01.480
as a material thing

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:04.040
but friendship is incredibly important in life

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:05.480
love is incredibly important in life

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.760
you know having a group of friends

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:10.040
is incredibly important in life

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.480
all of these are sticky and important

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:14.600
okay how can I try to be eloquent on this

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.920
so if you give people freedom

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:18.920
if you give people

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.040
politics yeah

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.000
well not politics

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:21.720
relations

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:22.280
relations

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:24.840
relationships

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.440
so this is interesting

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.960
because we have an interesting dynamic

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.560
going on here in terms of beliefs

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.440
they're differing

01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.440
and there's interesting overlaps

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.040
but there's a worry

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:37.320
if you look at human history

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:38.840
and you study the lessons of history

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.520
and you look at modern society

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.760
if you give people freedom

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.120
in terms of stickiness

01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.080
and human relations

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:45.560
and so on

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.680
like if you not give people freedom

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.280
emphasize freedom as the highest ideal

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.240
you start getting more tinder

01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:57.240
online dating

01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:58.520
the stickiness dissolves

01:42:58.520 --> 01:42:59.960
just like in chemistry

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:02.680
you start to have a gas versus a liquid

01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.440
right that that's the way

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.360
so you have to what you have to study

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.360
what actually happens

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.840
if you emphasize that

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.000
the stickiness

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.600
the bonds of humans

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.680
is holding you back

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:19.080
the exercise of voluntary choice

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:21.000
is the highest ideal

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.920
the danger of that

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.560
is for that to be implemented

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.000
or interpreted

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.120
in certain kinds of ways

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.360
by us flawed humans

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.160
that are not

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:32.280
I mean you could say

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:33.880
we're perfectly reasonable and rational

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:35.400
we can think through all of our decisions

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:36.360
but really

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:38.520
I mean especially when you're young

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:39.240
you get horny

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.040
you make decisions

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:42.440
that are suboptimal perhaps

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.040
so the the point is

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.560
you have to look at reality

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.160
of when you emphasize different things

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.840
so when you talk about

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:53.240
what is the ideal life

01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.000
what is the ideal relations

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:55.960
you have to also think like

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.240
what are you emphasizing

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:59.160
I think you both agree on what's important

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.880
that community can be important

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:03.480
that freedom is important

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.920
but what are you emphasizing

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.000
and you're really emphasizing the individual

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.080
and you're emphasizing

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:11.400
your arm you're emphasizing

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.320
more of the community

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:16.360
of the family

01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:17.800
of the stickiness of the nation

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:19.240
we will look

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:20.360
I don't want to deny

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.640
the place of the individual

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.400
I think that

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.680
that there really is

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:28.760
a very great change

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.200
in civilization

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.360
when the books of Moses

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:34.120
announce that

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:36.200
the individual is created

01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:37.320
in the image of God

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.640
that's a step that's

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.480
as far as we know

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.640
without precedent before that

01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:44.280
in history

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.240
and to a very large degree

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:49.240
I mean one of the kind of unspoken

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.160
things going on

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:51.800
is that that

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:54.280
Yaron and I really do agree

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:55.240
on all sorts of things

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.320
I think in part because

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.760
because we're both Jewish

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:01.320
and you did you just say

01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:03.960
Yaron is basically Moses yesterday

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.840
no I said he was channeling Moses

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:08.760
but that's still in my book

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:09.880
you know that's still pretty

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:10.280
impressive

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:11.000
that's a compliment

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:11.640
that's pretty

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:12.440
I took it to the point

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.520
for me that's a compliment

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.480
and we'll talk about this

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.760
a little bit just for the listener

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.600
just so they know

01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.760
Yaron amongst many things

01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:21.320
we'll talk about

01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:22.920
the virtue of nationalism

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:25.000
but you're also

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.360
a religious scholar of sorts

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.280
or at least leverage

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.760
the Bible for much

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:31.320
not much

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.360
but some of the wisdom

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:32.840
in your life

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:34.600
look the way that

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.360
Yaron looks at enlightenment

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:37.880
or maybe at Ayn Rand

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.520
that's the way that I see

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:42.760
the Hebrew scripture

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:43.720
and the tradition

01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.520
that comes from it

01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:46.840
it has the same kind of place

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:47.400
in my life

01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:48.680
and I just

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.200
I don't know how much

01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.280
we want to explore it

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.960
but I think that

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.960
the agreement that we do have

01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:00.280
about the positive value

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.840
of the creative individual

01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.040
the positive value

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:07.080
of the individual's desire

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:08.520
to improve the world

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:11.320
and in my book

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:13.320
that means including

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.920
his or her desire

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.920
to improve his family

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.680
his tribe

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.640
his congregation

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:20.200
his nation

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:22.360
but it still comes from

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:23.000
this kind of

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.160
for what Yaron calls selfishness

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.400
the desire to make things

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:28.280
better for yourself

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.680
in Hebrew Bible

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:31.640
and in Judaism

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:34.280
that just is a positive thing

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:35.880
of course it can be taken too far

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:37.960
but it just is positive

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.960
and it doesn't carry these kinds of

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.400
you know

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:42.600
you should turn the other cheek

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.800
you should give away your cloak

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:45.080
you should love your enemy

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:46.680
these kinds of Christian tropes

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.520
do not exist in Judaism

01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:49.480
and so it just

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.200
I like listening to Yaron's

01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.640
I do feel like he goes too far

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:54.840
on various things

01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.200
but I also hear

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:57.400
underneath that I can sort of

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.120
hear the Jewish current

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:01.240
and the resistance to

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:03.720
to things that

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:05.320
about Christianity

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.680
that Jews often find

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.880
Can I ask you a question there?

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:11.160
Can you make an argument

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.280
for turn the other cheek?

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:13.400
No

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:14.440
I tend to

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:16.040
I guess you would equate that

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:16.840
with altruism

01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:19.480
I tend to

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:20.600
Injustice

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.840
It's unjust to turn the other cheek

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:23.480
I agree

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:26.360
You don't love yourself

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.400
if you're turning the other cheek

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:29.000
it's a lack of love

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.040
lack of self-respect

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:31.480
Well let me push back on that

01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:32.040
because I'm a

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.760
I like turn the other cheek

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:36.520
especially on Twitter

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.960
I like block the offender on Twitter

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:47.880
So Twitter aside

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:48.840
is more like you're

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.920
you're investing in the long-term

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.800
version of yourself

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:54.920
versus the short-term

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.480
so that's the way I think about it

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.640
it's like the energy you put onto the world

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.640
the turning out the cheek philosophy

01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:04.040
allows you to walk through the fire gracefully

01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:06.040
in some sense

01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.280
I mean perhaps you would reframe that as not a

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.760
then that's not being altruistic or whatever

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:15.480
but there is something pragmatic

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:17.160
about that kind of approach to life

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:19.720
Disciplining yourself

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:22.120
so that you become a better version of yourself

01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:24.840
I mean not only do we agree

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:27.560
but I think every religious

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:28.920
and philosophical tradition

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.760
probably has a version of that

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:33.400
even Kant who we join together

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:35.000
in finding to be terrible

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.520
even Kant makes that distinction

01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:37.640
between the short-term interest

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:39.000
and the long-term interest

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.560
so I think that's universal

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.440
I don't know of anybody

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.200
who's really disagreeing about that

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:46.120
the thing that we were talking about

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:47.720
a couple of minutes ago

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:49.240
before we got onto this tangent

01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:53.240
is the relationship between the individual

01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.480
who is in the image of God

01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:00.200
and is of value as an individual

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.520
nevertheless there's this question about

01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:06.040
what is good for that person

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.440
and also what makes him happy

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.120
I'm not sure that those are exactly the same things

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:14.360
but they're both certainly relevant and important

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:18.200
and I feel like

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:20.200
I mean I think we're beginning to uncover

01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.720
this empirical disagreement

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.960
about what it is that's good for the individual

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.160
and what it is that makes them happy

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.160
and I'll go back to something I raised in the debate

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.440
which is this this theory of Durkheim

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.960
that now has been popularized by Jordan Peterson

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:46.920
but Durkheim argues that he's writing a book on suicide

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:47.960
he's trying to understand

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:50.040
what brings individuals to suicide

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:53.640
and he coins this term anomie, lack of law

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:58.520
and the argument is that individuals

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:02.200
basically are healthy and happy

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.520
when they find their place in a hierarchy

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.640
within a loyalty group

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.400
in a certain place in a hierarchy

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:11.640
they compete and struggle

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:13.160
in order to rise in the hierarchy

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:15.080
but they know where they are

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:16.200
they know who they are

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.400
the kids today like to say

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.480
they know what their identity is

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:22.360
because they associate themselves

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.840
their self-expansed to take on

01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:25.720
you know the leadership

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:26.680
the different layers

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:29.800
the past and the future of this particular hierarchy

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.800
and I completely agree with Yaron

01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:35.400
that some of these hierarchies are pernicious

01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:38.440
and oppressive and terrible

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:39.400
and some of them are better

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.840
what we might disagree about

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:47.000
is that you can find human beings

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.840
who are capable of becoming healthy and happy

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:52.760
off by themselves

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:55.720
without participating in this kind of structure

01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.400
the minute that you accept

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:01.240
if you accept that this is empirical reality

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.120
about human beings

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:04.360
it's an iron law

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.520
you can't do anything

01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:08.120
you can tell human beings

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:10.920
that they can be free of all constraints

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.480
all you want

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:13.880
and you can get them to do things

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:17.560
that as you say dissolve their place

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:19.320
that they can have contempt for hierarchies

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:21.640
they can say I'm not going to serve the man

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:22.920
I'm going to you know

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.920
I'm just going to burn them all down

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.640
you can get them to say all

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:29.080
get kids to say all of these things

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:31.160
you can get them either to be Marxists

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:34.360
who are actively trying to overthrow

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:36.200
and destroy the existing hierarchies

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.960
or you can make them some kind of liberal

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:39.000
where they basically pretend

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.440
the hierarchies don't exist

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:42.600
they just act like they're not there

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:44.760
in both cases

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.800
and it's not a coincidence

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:47.320
that that's what universities teach

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:49.880
is your choice is either Marxist revolution

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:52.200
or liberal ignoring of the hierarchies

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.680
in both cases

01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:56.520
what you've done is you've eliminated

01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:59.160
the possibility that the young person

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:03.320
will be able to find his or her place

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:05.400
in a way that allows them to grow

01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:08.120
and exercise their love

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.040
their drive their creativity

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:13.240
in order to advance something constructive

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:14.440
you've eliminated it

01:52:14.440 --> 01:52:16.600
and you've put the burden on them

01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.640
you know kind of a Nietzschean burden

01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:25.080
to just be the fountain of all values yourself

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.040
which you know maybe some people can do it

01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.360
but almost no one can do it

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.200
and I think that's empirically true

01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.960
and so I think by telling them

01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:36.280
about their freedom

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:37.560
rather than telling them about

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:40.440
about the need to join

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.560
into some traditionalist hierarchy

01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:45.000
that can be good and healthy for them

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:47.160
I think we're destroying them

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.000
I think we're destroying this generation

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.760
and the last one and the next

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:56.280
Yaron is the burden of freedom destroying mankind

01:52:57.400 --> 01:52:58.440
what freedom I mean

01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:00.920
how many people are indeed free

01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:02.920
look the problem is that

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:05.400
we were caught up on political concepts

01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:10.840
and we've we're moving into ethical issues

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:13.720
and I don't think it's right to tell people

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:16.200
you're free go do whatever the hell you want

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.480
just just use your emotions

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.320
you know just just go where you want to go

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:23.160
you know in the spur of the moment

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:24.040
think short term

01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:24.840
don't think long term

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:26.120
or don't think why think

01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:29.160
one has to provide moral guidance

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:32.280
and morality here is crucial

01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:33.480
and crucially important

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.000
and part of taking responsibility for your own life

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.720
is establishing a moral framework

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:41.160
for your life

01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:44.280
and what does it mean to live a good life

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:45.880
I mean that's much more important in a sense

01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.040
of a question and it is

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:51.320
it is my belief that people can do that

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.080
they can find and choose

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:56.280
the values necessary to achieve a good life

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.160
but they need guidance

01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:58.440
they need guidance

01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:00.360
this is why religion evolved in my view

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:01.480
because people need guidance

01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:03.400
so so so it says you know

01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:05.880
I had called religion a primitive form of philosophy

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.240
it was the original philosophy

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:09.480
that provided people with some guidance

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:11.320
about what to do and what not to do

01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:14.200
and secular philosophy is supposed to do the same

01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:15.400
and the problem is

01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:20.280
that I think religion and 99% of secular philosophy

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:23.320
give people bad advice about what to do

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.240
and therefore they do bad stuff

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:27.640
and and some of that sometimes

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:29.640
you know because

01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:31.640
when they do good stuff

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.800
it gets reinforced that we survive in spite of that

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:38.040
but ideas like Kant and Hegel and Marx and so on

01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:39.960
give young people awful advice

01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.400
about how to live and what to do

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.640
and as a consequence really bad stuff happens

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:45.640
the world in which we exist today

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:46.360
which we agree

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.880
there are a lot of pathologies to it

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:51.640
a lot of bad stuff going on

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:53.080
in my view is going the wrong way

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:57.240
in my view a product of a set of ideas

01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.800
on the one hand I think Christian ideas

01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:04.520
on the other hand I think secular philosophical ideas

01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.120
that have driven this country

01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:07.560
and the world more generally

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:09.400
in a really really bad direction

01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:12.680
and this is why what I do what I do

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:14.920
because I think at the core of it

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.200
the only way to change it

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:19.560
is not to impose a new set of ideas from the top

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:22.280
because I worry about who's going to be doing the imposition

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:25.080
plus I don't believe you can force people to be good

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:27.400
it's to challenge the ideas

01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:28.920
it's to question the ideas

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:31.960
it's to present an alternative view of morality

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:34.760
an alternative set of moral principles

01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:36.040
and alternative ultimately

01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.960
an alternative view of political principles

01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:39.960
but it has to start with morality

01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:40.840
if you don't

01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:43.000
and my morality centered on the individual

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.520
and what the individual should do with his life

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.520
in order to attain a good life

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:49.080
I believe that leads to happiness

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.200
but the good life that's why it's good

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:54.520
right the goal is survival

01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:55.960
and thriving and flourishing

01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:57.560
and happiness ultimately

01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:01.800
but politics is a servant of that in the end

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:03.480
it's not an end in itself

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:06.520
so the real issue is you know you asked before

01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:07.720
what is the value of relationship

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:09.560
there's an almost value in relationship

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:11.000
because we get values from other people

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.440
we don't produce all our values

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:14.520
we don't produce all our spiritual values

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.760
and we don't produce all our material values

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:20.440
other people on a massive benefit to us

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:21.960
because they produce values we can't

01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.040
there's a massive division of labor

01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.280
in terms of values not just in economics

01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:28.520
but also in philosophy and elsewhere

01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:29.560
it's why we have teachers

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:30.760
it's why we have moral teachers

01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:32.360
moral teachers are important

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.280
to help guide us towards a good life

01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:35.880
not all of us are philosophers

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.280
but what I do demand

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.400
if you all have individuals

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.920
this is where I put a burden on people

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:43.160
right understand what you're doing

01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:47.800
right you know don't embrace a moral teaching

01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:49.800
because it was tradition

01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:51.400
don't embrace a moral teaching

01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:52.840
because your parents embraced it

01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:54.360
don't embrace a moral teaching

01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:56.040
just because your teachers are teaching it

01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:59.000
challenge it think about it

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.640
embrace it because you embrace it

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:02.680
you might be wrong

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:04.360
you might embrace the wrong one

01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:06.120
but take moral responsibility

01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:07.960
take responsibility over your life

01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.160
by evaluating testing challenging

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:13.800
what you have received

01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:18.360
and choosing what you're going to pursue

01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.280
and I acknowledge empirically

01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:21.560
that most people don't do that

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:25.880
and this is why intellectual leadership

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:26.680
is so important

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:30.760
this is why you want the voices

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.840
in a culture to be good voices

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.120
so that those people

01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:35.320
who don't think for themselves

01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:37.160
land up being followers

01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:38.280
but they end up being followers

01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:39.480
of somebody good versus

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:40.520
followers of somebody bad

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:43.720
but for the thinkers in the world out there

01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:45.400
who I think are the people who count

01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:47.000
who the people who shape society

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.160
oh boy no no shape society

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:50.360
wait a minute not count

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.720
in a sense that you can dismiss

01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:52.520
the lives of others

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:54.360
and you know because I'm you know

01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:55.560
obviously I'm anti-corrosion

01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:56.200
and anti-violence

01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:57.240
they sound like Plato

01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:00.200
but yes I don't want to sound like Plato

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.040
but in a sense that they're the ones

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.720
who shape who land up shaping the world

01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:05.320
they're the ones who land up shaping

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:06.680
how there will be

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:08.920
I want those people to make choices

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.200
about their values

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:11.800
and not to just accept them

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:12.760
based on tradition

01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:13.640
or based the commandment

01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:16.680
or based on where they happen to grow up

01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:18.040
and in that sense again

01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.120
you know I do

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:22.440
and this is an interesting point

01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:23.880
where we disagree

01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:25.080
but I'm not exactly sure

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:26.280
what your own position is

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:27.800
I do believe in universal values

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.880
that is there are things that are good

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:31.160
and there are things that are evil

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.520
and I think we agree on that

01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:33.800
and there are systems

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:36.840
we agree that communism and fascism are evil

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.600
well I think we should be able to agree

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:39.240
that some things

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:40.920
some political systems are good

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.760
and maybe there's this middle ground

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.600
where we both think

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:46.840
that they're not particularly bad

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:47.800
but not particularly good

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:48.600
and you all might think

01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:50.280
they're better than I think they are

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:51.480
but if we can agree

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:52.840
and this is good

01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:54.360
and this is evil right

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:55.720
then the systems that tend

01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:57.000
towards the good are good

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.560
and the systems that tend towards the evil are evil

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:01.160
and but that's universal right

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:03.720
you know I look at places

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:05.320
like South Korea

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:05.800
Japan

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:07.720
Asia you know cultures

01:59:07.720 --> 01:59:08.840
that are very very different

01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:10.520
in many respects in the West

01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:11.640
and yet when they adopt

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:15.880
certain western ideas

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:17.640
about freedom

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:18.120
about liberty

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:19.000
about individualism

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.200
I mean the Japanese constitution

01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:21.720
because MacArthur forced it in there

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:23.000
has the pursuit of happiness

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:23.960
in the constitution

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:24.920
not because they chose it

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:26.120
because he put it in there

01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:28.760
but they to some extent adopted that

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.200
and they're successful

01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:32.600
they're successful places today

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:34.200
those societies in Asia

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:35.720
that didn't adopt these values

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:37.480
are not successful societies today

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:37.980
Yaron

01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:41.800
Japan has a birth rate of

01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:42.520
what is it

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:47.320
1.1 1.2 children per woman

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.280
I mean look

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.160
there are some things

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:53.480
there's some places

01:59:53.480 --> 01:59:55.000
where you give people freedom

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.680
this is also biblical

01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:58.440
right the idea that

01:59:58.440 --> 01:59:59.560
everyone did what's right

01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:00.280
in his own eyes

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.040
okay right this is a

02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:04.760
refrain in the book of judges

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:07.320
and the Bible is not

02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:08.840
an anti-freedom book

02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:10.360
I mean there's many many

02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:12.840
look no we're not

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:14.520
fine we'll get there

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:16.840
okay okay look

02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:18.200
just as an asterisk

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:19.560
I'm not asking you

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:20.280
because you know

02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:21.160
because the Bible is such

02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:22.120
a great authoritarian

02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:23.800
but it's not that at all

02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:26.200
my in my view

02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:28.120
if you want to know where

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:29.800
you know where this

02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:31.480
what you call the

02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:32.920
the sanctity of property

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:33.800
where does the sanctity

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:35.080
of property comes from

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:36.360
it comes from the Ten Commandments

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:38.520
it comes from Moses saying

02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:39.560
I haven't taken anything

02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:40.040
from anyone

02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:41.160
it comes from Samuel saying

02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:42.120
I haven't taken anything

02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:42.680
from anyone

02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:44.440
it's the condemnation of Ahav

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:45.560
of the unjust kings

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:46.680
who steal the property

02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:49.240
of their subjects

02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:50.360
so I'm not so

02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:52.440
property and freedom

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:55.000
I think there's great basis

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
for it in the Bible

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.480
but right now I'm focusing on

02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:01.000
on this other question

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.240
which is what happens

02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:04.120
when everyone does

02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:05.400
what's right in his own eyes

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:06.520
that's the book of judges

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:07.960
and that's that's this

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:10.680
civil war moral corruption

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:14.200
theft idolatry murder rape

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.560
I mean there's that

02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:16.440
that's what happens

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:17.240
when everyone everyone

02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:17.960
does whatever is right

02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:19.160
in his own eyes

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:20.440
well no it's what that

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:21.720
that's what it says in the text

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:23.000
I'm not okay so

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.480
when I look at you're right

02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:26.280
there are things

02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:28.280
that I think are objectively true

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.240
I think it's really hard

02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:30.680
to get people to agree

02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:31.400
agree to them

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:33.720
almost impossible

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:35.960
but when I look at a country

02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:38.840
which is is approaching

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:43.240
one birth per woman

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:44.920
in other words half of

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:46.200
the minimum necessary

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:47.720
for replacement

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:49.640
you can say whatever you want

02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:50.360
whatever you want

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:51.320
about immigration

02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:52.680
we can have that discussion

02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:53.800
but the point is

02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:56.840
that when your values

02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:57.640
are such

02:01:57.640 --> 02:01:59.480
that you're not even capable

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:01.640
of doing the most basic techniques

02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:02.840
that human beings need

02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:03.640
in order to be able

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:04.840
to propagate themselves

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.040
and their values

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:07.720
and the way they see things

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:09.800
then I look you're finished

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:10.840
you can't say that

02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.200
so if I implied

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:14.120
that Japan is an ideal society

02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:14.840
I take that back

02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:17.000
but no I just think

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:17.880
about Japan for a minute

02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:19.320
I just think we're in trouble

02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:20.440
and we're in trouble

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:22.520
give me a second

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:23.400
hold that hold you that

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:27.320
it's his show man

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:29.000
we enter into his hierarchy

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:29.960
that's it

02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:31.960
we should talk about hierarchy

02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:35.640
just to clarify

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:38.200
how do you explain

02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.320
the situation in Japan

02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.760
is it the decrease in value

02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:42.040
and family like some of them

02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:44.760
just expand on that

02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:46.040
how do you explain that situation

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:47.560
you're saying that

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:49.400
that society is in trouble

02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:50.440
in a certain way

02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.640
can you kind of describe

02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:53.240
the nature of that trouble

02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:57.320
I'm saying that when the individual

02:02:57.320 --> 02:03:00.280
is part of a social group

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:01.880
this can be a family

02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:03.000
a congregation

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:03.800
a community

02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:04.280
a tribe

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:04.840
a nation

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.960
when the individual feels

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:08.600
that the things

02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:09.320
that are happening

02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:10.280
to the society

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:11.720
are things that are happening

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:12.840
to him or to her

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:14.760
and I want to emphasize

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:16.920
this is not the standard view

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.200
of collectivism

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:18.760
that you know

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:21.560
that Mussolini will say

02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:22.840
the glory of the individual

02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:24.440
is in totally immersing himself

02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:27.080
in the organic whole

02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.120
that's not what I'm saying

02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:29.320
I'm saying that human beings

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:32.200
have and are both

02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:34.360
they enter into a society

02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:35.880
to which they are loyal

02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:38.600
and they compete with one another

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:41.560
in the terms

02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:43.240
that that society allows competition

02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:44.120
but also sometimes

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:45.160
by bending the rules

02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:45.960
and by shaping them

02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:47.400
and by changing them

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:51.400
what you see in many societies

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.560
certainly throughout the liberal west

02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:55.000
but also in countries

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:55.880
that have been affected

02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:56.760
by the liberal west

02:03:56.760 --> 02:03:58.120
by industrialization

02:03:58.120 --> 02:03:59.720
and ideas of individualism

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:03.160
what you see is a collapse

02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:05.560
of a willingness of the individual

02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:09.000
to look at what is needed

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.600
by the whole

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:13.480
and to make choices

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:16.360
that are as your own

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:17.240
would call them selfish

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:19.080
because the purpose of them

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.160
is self-expression

02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:22.200
competition

02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:23.080
self-assertion

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:24.360
moving up in the hierarchy

02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.760
achieving honor

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:29.400
or wealth

02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:31.560
in order to do those things

02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:34.200
but when you stop being able

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.360
to look at the framework

02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.640
of a particular society

02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.680
and identify with it

02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:42.600
you cease to understand

02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:43.880
what it is that you need to do

02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.040
not every single person

02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:47.880
but I'm talking about society-wide

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:49.080
so there are few individuals

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:50.040
who are just going to have

02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:51.080
a fantastic time

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.120
and live the kind of life

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:53.640
that you're on is describing

02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:55.320
and the great majority

02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:57.960
they stop being willing to take risks

02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.640
they stop being willing to get married

02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:01.240
they stop being willing to have children

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.160
they stop being willing to start companies

02:05:03.160 --> 02:05:04.200
they stop being willing

02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:05.320
to put themselves out

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:07.000
to do great things

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.240
because the guide rails

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:11.560
that told them what kinds of things

02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:13.640
and the social feedback

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:14.760
that honored them

02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:15.800
when they did things

02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:16.760
like getting married

02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:17.720
and having children

02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:18.840
they've been crushed

02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:20.200
and what have they been crushed by

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:23.320
they've been crushed by the false view

02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:24.760
that if you tell the individual

02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:27.160
be free make all your own decisions

02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.120
that they will then be free

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:29.240
and make all their own decisions

02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:29.880
they don't

02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:30.760
they just stop

02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:31.880
they stop being human

02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:34.200
that's powerful

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:35.960
so do you want to respond to that

02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:39.240
yes so I don't think anybody

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:39.880
should have children

02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:41.960
it's the goal

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:45.560
there's a good tweet

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:46.200
clip that out

02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:47.480
tweet clip that you can make

02:05:49.880 --> 02:05:50.600
I don't think anybody

02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:51.560
should have children

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:55.000
for the goal of perpetuating

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:55.880
their nation

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:58.360
or expanding their society

02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.280
or for some people

02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:02.920
I think they'd make horrible parents

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:03.960
if that was the goal

02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:05.480
the purpose of doing it

02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:07.800
I think people should have children

02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:09.000
because they want to embrace

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:09.720
that challenge

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:12.120
that beauty

02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:14.200
that experience

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:16.440
that amazing very very hard

02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:19.000
very very difficult experience in life

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.760
it's about being able

02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:21.800
to project a long term

02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:24.040
but also being able to enjoy

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:25.160
and love the creation

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:26.360
of another human being

02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:27.800
that process of creation

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.960
it is a beautiful self-interested thing

02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:30.520
and by the way

02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:31.720
not everybody should have children

02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:33.800
I think way too many people have children

02:06:34.520 --> 02:06:35.960
there's some awful parents out there

02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:38.200
that I wish would stop

02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:39.400
I mean there are

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:40.600
life is precious

02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:43.480
and life of suffering is sad

02:06:43.480 --> 02:06:45.080
it's sad to see people suffering

02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.840
a lot of people are born into situations

02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:48.840
and are born into parents

02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:51.000
that destroy the capacity

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.120
to ever live a good life

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:55.080
and that's a tragic and sad thing

02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:58.840
and so I don't measure

02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:01.000
the health of a society

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:03.480
in how many children they're having

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:05.000
or a health of a couple

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.440
whether they have children or not

02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:07.560
those are individual choices

02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:09.880
some people make a choice

02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:10.600
not to have children

02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:11.800
which is completely rational

02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:13.080
consistent with their values

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:15.720
now when you look at a society overall

02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:17.400
I do think having children

02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:18.360
and not having children

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:20.120
is a reflection of something

02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:21.080
I think it's a reflection

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:22.040
of a certain optimism

02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:22.840
about the future

02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:23.800
I think it's a reflection

02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:24.840
of thinking long term

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:26.040
versus short term

02:07:26.040 --> 02:07:27.320
I think a short term society

02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:28.120
doesn't have children

02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:29.400
people don't have children there

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.960
because children are long term investment

02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:34.840
they require real planning

02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:35.800
and real effort

02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:37.720
and real thinking about the long term

02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:39.000
but those are moral issues

02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:41.080
and again we're confusing

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:42.440
or mixing

02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.360
when I say Japan

02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:45.800
look how well Japan has done

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:47.000
I don't mean

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.360
the specific Japanese people

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:49.320
and how many kids they're having

02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:50.520
and what kind of life they're having

02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:53.080
in terms of these kind of particulars

02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:56.120
but think about the alternatives Japan faces

02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:57.160
if you look around

02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.800
the options that they face

02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:01.800
they tried empire

02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:04.040
they tried nationalistic empire

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:05.560
didn't turn out too well for them

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:07.480
or anybody who they interacted with

02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:09.960
they could have become North Korea

02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:11.880
we know how that turned out

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:12.520
we know what that is

02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:13.640
they could have been Cambodia

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:14.680
if you've ever been to Cambodia

02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:16.120
and seen the kind of poverty

02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:17.400
and yes maybe Cambodians

02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:18.200
have lots of children

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.800
but God I'd rather be in Japan any day

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:23.240
than have children

02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:24.280
in the kind of poverty

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.920
and horrific circumstances they have

02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:28.280
but in the context

02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:31.160
of the available regimes

02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:33.000
that were possible

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.040
post World War II

02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:35.560
for the Japanese to embrace

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:36.520
they embraced one

02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.360
that generally led to prosperity

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:39.640
to freedom

02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:41.480
to individuals pursuing values

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.680
not perfectly

02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:44.200
because they didn't implement

02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:45.800
the philosophical foundation

02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:46.760
the moral foundation

02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:48.680
that I would like them to have

02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:50.680
they're still being impacted

02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:52.440
by Kantian, Hegelian

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.800
whatever philosophy

02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:54.840
that's out there in the West

02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:57.320
that's destroying the better parts

02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:59.000
so you give people freedom

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.520
now what do they do with it

02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:02.440
and if they have a bad philosophy

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:03.880
they're going to do bad things

02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:04.920
with that freedom

02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:06.520
right you tell people

02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:08.440
to do whatever they choose to do

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.880
but if they have bad ideas

02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:12.200
they will choose to do bad things

02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:14.200
so it is true

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:15.720
that the primacy of morality

02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:17.240
and the primacy of philosophy

02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:19.160
has to be recognized

02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:21.400
it's not the primacy of politics

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:23.640
and indeed you don't get free societies

02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:26.680
unless you have some elements

02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:29.000
of decent philosophy

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.840
but you can get free societies

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:31.880
with a rotten philosophy

02:09:31.880 --> 02:09:33.320
but they don't stay free

02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:33.800
for very long

02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:34.520
I don't understand

02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:36.360
how can it be a decent philosophy

02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:39.480
if it doesn't care about posterity

02:09:39.480 --> 02:09:40.520
if it does

02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:42.200
if you're willing to say

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.920
I'm offering guidance

02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:46.600
I think you should live as a traitor

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:48.520
all relationships should be voluntary

02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.280
those are interesting things

02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:53.080
but the moment that it comes to posterity

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:53.880
to the future

02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:55.480
to there being a future

02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:57.080
let's say that there were a society

02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:57.960
that lived the way

02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:59.000
you know in general

02:09:59.000 --> 02:09:59.880
according to your view

02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:01.800
let's say there was such a society

02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:03.320
how can you not care

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.680
whether that society is capable

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:05.400
of passing it on

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:06.840
to the next generation or not

02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:07.800
but the way to pass it on

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:08.600
to the next generation

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:09.480
is through ideas

02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:11.560
and not through having children

02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.480
having children is an individual choice

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:14.680
that some people are going to make

02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:15.480
and some people are not

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:16.840
but the fundamental

02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:19.640
that preserves the good life

02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:20.680
what does that even mean

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.880
there's a sense of it

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:24.920
if every generation from now on

02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:26.520
your society

02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:27.960
that was good at a certain point

02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:29.800
has half as many people in it

02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:31.800
it's going to very quickly

02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:33.480
it's just going to be overrun

02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:34.840
overrun by whom

02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:36.040
what do you mean overrun by whom

02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:38.120
are we just totally ahistorical

02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:39.320
if you're the Spartans

02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:40.440
and you have all of these

02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:42.760
you know like like warrior values

02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:44.200
but you stop having children

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:45.160
you get overrun

02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:45.800
you get defeated

02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:46.520
well in the case of Sparta

02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:47.000
that's a good thing

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:47.720
not a bad thing

02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:48.440
but I get it

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.160
that's not my point

02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:51.240
you have to have the ability

02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:52.600
to have enough children

02:10:52.600 --> 02:10:54.280
to create enough wealth

02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:54.920
and enough power

02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:55.800
enough strength

02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:58.040
who makes these kind of conclusions

02:10:58.040 --> 02:10:59.720
the decisions about how many

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:01.080
you make it as an individual

02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:02.440
and you decide

02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:03.080
that you know

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.120
we're not talking about

02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:05.480
we're talking about

02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:06.840
what kind of intellectual

02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:08.920
cultural religious inheritance

02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.120
you give your children

02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:12.120
yes and those are the ideas

02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:13.240
that I give my children

02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:13.960
and those ideas

02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:15.000
are going to perpetuate

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:15.960
because they're good ideas

02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:16.840
if they're bad ideas

02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:17.960
they're not going to perpetuate

02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:18.360
they can be

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:20.680
they can't be good ideas

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:21.800
if they don't produce

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:22.920
future generations

02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:23.960
what are you talking about

02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:24.840
why would they not produce

02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:25.960
future generations

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:26.520
I mean as I said

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:27.640
look at every liberal

02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:29.160
every liberal society

02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:29.800
on earth

02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:30.840
but I'm not defending

02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.120
democratic collapse

02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:33.400
there's not a single

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:34.840
liberal society on earth today

02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:35.880
that I'm willing to defend

02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:37.560
but because they're not living

02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:38.760
by my philosophy

02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:40.680
they've not accepted my ideas

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:41.800
they have a semblance

02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:43.640
I have a semblance

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:45.400
of a political system

02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:46.280
that is a little bit

02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:47.560
like what I would like

02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:49.000
far from what I would ideal

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:49.720
I know all of this

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:50.440
certainly don't have

02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:51.560
a moral foundation

02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:52.440
I believe that people

02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:54.280
who have the right moral foundation

02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:55.000
most of them

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:55.640
not all of them

02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:57.240
but most of them will have children

02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:58.520
most of them will

02:11:58.520 --> 02:11:59.960
continue into the future

02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:00.920
most of them will fight

02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:01.960
for a future

02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:04.040
but not because

02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:05.000
they care what happens

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.040
in 200 years

02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:06.920
but because they care

02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:07.720
about their lifetime

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:09.080
and part of having fun

02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:11.000
and enjoying one's lifetime

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.440
is having kids

02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:15.080
is projecting into the future

02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:16.600
are you really going to tell me

02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:17.800
that people have children

02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:18.840
because it's fun

02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:19.400
they're fun

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:20.360
when they're four years old

02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:21.080
they're not fun

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:22.680
when they're when they're 15

02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:23.720
no when they're 15

02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.280
they're not fun

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:24.680
I agree with that

02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:25.880
no they're just not fun

02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:26.440
look you don't do this

02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:27.720
I'm learning so much today

02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:28.600
you don't

02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:30.120
you don't do this for fun

02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:31.560
marriage also

02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:32.360
you don't do for fun

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:33.400
there are times that are fun

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:33.960
and there are times

02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:34.760
that are not fun

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:37.480
fun is not exactly the right word

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:38.840
but you certainly do it for

02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:40.120
you do it for happiness

02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:41.800
you do it for fulfillment

02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:43.560
you do it as a challenge

02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:44.680
you do it for making

02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:47.720
making your life better

02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:49.240
for making your life interesting

02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:50.920
for making your life challenging

02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:51.800
for embracing

02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:54.600
part of it is fun

02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:55.960
part of it is hard work

02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:57.400
but you do it

02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:58.360
because it's

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.720
it makes your life a better life

02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:02.600
that's very interesting

02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:03.880
so empirically speaking

02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:07.000
if you dissolve the cultural backbone

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.040
where everybody comes up

02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:09.080
like the background

02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:11.000
the moral ideas

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.200
that everybody is raised with

02:13:12.200 --> 02:13:13.160
if you dissolve that

02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:14.280
and if you truly emphasize

02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:14.920
the individual

02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:18.040
I think Yoram is saying

02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.920
it's going to naturally lead

02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:22.520
to the solution of marriage

02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:23.960
and all these concepts

02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:24.680
so you're not

02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:25.880
so like everything

02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:26.920
well basically saying

02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:28.040
you're not going to choose

02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:29.400
some of these things

02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:29.960
you're not

02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:31.800
you're going to more and more

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:34.760
choose the short-term optimization

02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:36.680
versus the long-term optimization

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:38.600
beyond your own life

02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:39.800
like posterity

02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:41.880
so I don't think about posterity

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.160
I don't know what posterity means

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:44.200
right I can project

02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:45.240
into my children's life

02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:47.560
maybe when I have grandchildren

02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:48.360
to grandchildren

02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:49.240
but it ends there

02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:50.840
I can't project 300 years

02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:51.880
in the future

02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:53.240
it's ridiculous to try to think

02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:54.520
about 300 years into the future

02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:55.880
things change so much

02:13:56.840 --> 02:13:58.280
but that's the founding fathers

02:13:58.280 --> 02:13:59.880
that's the conservative founding fathers

02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:01.080
well no I don't think

02:14:01.080 --> 02:14:02.360
I think they set up a system

02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:03.080
I think the whole idea

02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:04.440
was to set up a system

02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.200
that was self-perpetuating

02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:09.720
that would if people lived up to it

02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:10.040
right?

02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:10.600
no no

02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:11.800
would perpetuate the self-interpretation

02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:13.880
no systems are self-perpetuating

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:15.000
things rise and fall

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:15.560
and it's the

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:16.920
they don't necessarily rise and fall

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:17.720
I don't believe in that

02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:19.080
let me speak to your heart for a second

02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:22.680
the great individuals

02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:25.080
in societies are the people

02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:26.760
who have seen the decline

02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:27.800
understood it

02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:29.480
and provided resources

02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:31.080
in order to redirect

02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:31.960
and bring it back up

02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:33.000
you can't agree to that?

02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:36.120
I don't see it that way at all

02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:39.160
yes I want people out there

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:40.280
to rebel against

02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:41.320
conventional morality

02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:42.520
I think conventional morality

02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:43.880
is destructive to their own lives

02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:45.880
and broadly to posterity

02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:47.400
because I think it's unsustainable

02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:47.880
it's not good

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:48.760
and this goes to

02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:50.280
I think conventional morality

02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:51.240
is Christian morality

02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:51.960
it's a morality

02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:53.240
that's been secularized

02:14:53.240 --> 02:14:54.360
through Christian lens

02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:55.560
and I think it's destructive

02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:57.160
but I don't want them to dump that

02:14:57.160 --> 02:14:58.680
and not replace it with something

02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:00.040
I want

02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:02.360
and I think it's necessary

02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:03.560
and essential for people

02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:04.920
to have a moral code

02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:06.680
and to have a moral code

02:15:07.480 --> 02:15:08.360
morality is

02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:09.960
a set of guidelines

02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.840
to live your life

02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:12.040
it is a set of values

02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:14.040
to guide you

02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:14.920
to help you identify

02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:15.560
what is good for you

02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:16.440
and what is bad for you

02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:17.160
here's the thing

02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:18.120
let me argue against you

02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:19.160
let me hold on a second

02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:20.600
you're saying

02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:23.320
central to this morality

02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:25.400
that people should have is reason

02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:26.120
yes

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:26.620
okay

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:28.120
you're not saying other things

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:29.400
you're basically saying

02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:31.320
reason will arrive

02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:32.440
a lot of things

02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:33.560
why are you so sure

02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:35.720
that reason is so important?

02:15:35.720 --> 02:15:37.000
there's nothing else

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:37.800
no hold on a second

02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:38.920
but like it seems like

02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:39.880
obvious to you

02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:41.240
so first of all

02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:43.240
humans have limited cognitive capacity

02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:44.680
so even to assume

02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:46.840
the reason can actually function that well

02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:48.360
from an artificial intelligence

02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:50.680
researcher perspective

02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:52.280
this seems

02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:53.560
there's a whole discussion about

02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:54.520
whether there is such a thing

02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:55.720
as artificial intelligence

02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:57.480
whether that is what it is

02:15:58.600 --> 02:15:59.640
but see here's the thing

02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:01.000
I mean you're very confident

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.040
about this particular thing

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:03.480
but not about other aspects

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:04.200
of human nature

02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.120
that seems to be obviously present

02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:06.680
so yes

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:10.680
human relations

02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:11.400
love

02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:12.680
connection between us

02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:14.840
so it's very possible to argue

02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:16.280
that all of the accomplishments

02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:17.720
of reason would not exist

02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:18.440
without the connection

02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:19.160
of other humans

02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:20.920
of course that's true

02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:22.200
it's not obvious though

02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:23.960
it's possible that reason

02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:26.600
is a property of the collective

02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:27.640
of multiple people

02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:28.920
interacting with each other

02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:30.520
when you look at the greatest inventions

02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:31.560
of human history

02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:32.840
some people tell that story

02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:34.280
by individual inventors

02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:36.280
you could argue that's true

02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:38.120
some people say that it's

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:39.800
it's a bunch of people

02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:41.000
in a room together

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.280
the idea is bubbling

02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:43.160
and if you're saying

02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:46.360
individual is primary

02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:47.800
and they have the full power

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.560
and the capacity to make choices

02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:51.880
I don't know if that's necessarily

02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:54.520
so there's a straw manning going on here

02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:55.880
yeah of my position right

02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:57.160
yep of course

02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:58.120
my favorite thing to do

02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:00.920
you don't do it

02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:02.040
and you do it more politely

02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:03.000
than anybody else I know

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:03.960
when you do it

02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:05.080
of course we all stand

02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:06.280
on the shoulders of giants

02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:07.800
of course invention

02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:09.720
and science is collaborative

02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:11.160
not always

02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:12.680
not 100 percent

02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:15.880
Newton stood on the shoulders of giants

02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:17.560
I don't know how collaborative he was

02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:18.840
he wasn't exactly known

02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:20.040
as a bubbling up

02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:22.680
and testing ideas out with other people

02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:24.760
but this is a metaphysical fact

02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:25.800
you can't eat for me

02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:28.200
there's no collective stomach

02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:29.080
you can't eat for me

02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:31.880
you know you can provide me with food

02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:33.240
but I need to do the eating

02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.200
you can't think for me

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.600
you can help stimulate my thought

02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:39.000
you can challenge my thinking

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.120
you can add to it

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:41.720
but in the end of the day

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:43.320
only I can either do my thinking

02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:44.200
or not do my thinking

02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:45.400
but I need to think

02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:47.880
but you can think all by yourself alone

02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:49.640
what does that mean all by yourself

02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:51.880
can I think on a desert island

02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:53.320
yes I can think on a desert island

02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:55.560
can I think as big

02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:57.000
and as broad

02:17:57.560 --> 02:17:59.480
and as deep as I can

02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:03.320
in Aristotle's Lyceum

02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:04.360
of course not

02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:05.320
I'm a much better thinker

02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:06.600
in Aristotle's Lyceum

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:09.320
or in any kind of situation like this

02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:10.680
where you're going to challenge me

02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:11.400
and I have to come back

02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:12.600
and I have to think deeply

02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.040
about what it is you said

02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:15.160
and why I'm not communicating

02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:15.880
very effectively

02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:17.960
and why you're not understanding me

02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:20.120
of course now you're causing me

02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:21.240
to think much more deeply

02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:22.200
and to challenge me

02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:23.640
but it's still true that I have to think

02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:25.880
and if I don't think for myself

02:18:25.880 --> 02:18:26.920
who's going to think for me

02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:32.120
so this is why I'm not a philosopher

02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:34.120
I'm certainly not an original thinker

02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:34.840
in that sense

02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:37.400
I recognize the fact

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:38.680
that there are geniuses

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:39.880
that are much smarter than me

02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:41.400
whether it's Aristotle, Ayn Rand

02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:43.240
or people that inspire me

02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:44.600
I study their work

02:18:44.600 --> 02:18:45.560
I try to understand it

02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:46.600
to the best of my ability

02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:49.240
but I don't take it as gospel

02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:50.040
I take it as

02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:53.080
this is something I need to figure out

02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:54.120
I need to learn it

02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:55.240
I need to understand it

02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:56.520
because it's good for my life

02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:57.880
it's important to me

02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:59.720
but I have to do the thinking

02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:00.760
it won't be mine

02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:02.520
it'll be behind my hands

02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:03.480
but it won't be mine

02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:04.840
unless I've done the thinking

02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:07.080
to integrate it into my soul

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:08.840
into my consciousness

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.040
into my mind

02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:11.240
but it's still true that

02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:12.680
I have to think for myself

02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:13.800
not on a desert island

02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:16.360
and I now regret

02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:17.560
ever using a desert island

02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.640
in the book as an example

02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:22.920
because we've achieved something

02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:25.160
there is progress

02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:26.360
removing progress

02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:27.800
once truth is taken

02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:29.320
clearly it was misunderstood

02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:32.040
I didn't make myself clear enough

02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:32.600
in the book

02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:33.800
in terms of what I meant

02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:38.280
but I do not advocate

02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:40.840
for thinking alone in a dark room

02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:42.280
not engaging with reality

02:19:42.280 --> 02:19:43.320
not studying history

02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:44.760
not knowing about the world

02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:45.800
or on a desert island

02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:46.360
not interacting with other people

02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:47.800
so you're a collectivist

02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:49.400
no I'm a traitor

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:51.640
so I enjoy what we're doing right now

02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:53.160
because you're challenging me

02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:54.600
you make me a better thinker

02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:56.360
it's interesting

02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:57.240
you know the fact that

02:19:57.960 --> 02:19:59.720
a lot of people are going to watch this

02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:01.160
plays into it as well

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:02.440
but I would probably

02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:03.640
enjoy engaging with you

02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:03.960
in conversation

02:20:03.960 --> 02:20:05.320
it's not even recording so

02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:06.360
yeah there you go

02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:08.280
I would enjoy engaging with you

02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:09.720
with your own in conversation

02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:11.400
even if it wasn't being recorded

02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:12.120
and even if it was

02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:14.280
because you know

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:15.160
that kind of conversation

02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:15.640
makes me better

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:17.080
there's some people who I wouldn't

02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:19.160
there's some people who make it worse

02:20:19.160 --> 02:20:20.520
right that you want to walk

02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:21.960
that you walk away from the conversation

02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:23.560
because they're harmful to you

02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:24.840
and this is where choice comes in

02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:27.080
I want to be able to choose

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.360
who I engage with

02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:29.800
I don't always have that choice

02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:31.560
because as a public intellectual

02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:32.520
you go in front of audiences

02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:34.440
you don't always choose who it is

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:35.560
but you want to choose

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:36.360
who you engage with

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:37.400
and who you don't

02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:38.600
you want to choose

02:20:38.600 --> 02:20:40.280
the forum in which you engage

02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:41.240
and how you engage

02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:43.000
and the standard for me is reason

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:43.800
there is no other standard

02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:45.400
so you asked a deep question

02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:46.120
to start off

02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:47.000
why reason right

02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:50.520
because that's where the values come from

02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:51.640
that's the only tool

02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:53.240
we have to discover truth

02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:55.400
yes you know reason is something that

02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:57.400
it doesn't guarantee truth

02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:58.600
it doesn't guarantee

02:20:58.600 --> 02:20:59.560
the world is right

02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:00.280
it's fallible

02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:01.880
but it's all we have

02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:03.000
it's the tool in which

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.240
we evaluate the world around us

02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:06.840
and we come to conclusions about it

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:09.000
there is there just isn't other tool

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.800
emotions are not tools of cognition

02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:16.120
consciousness is a tool

02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:17.880
emotion like love

02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:19.160
all of these things

02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:21.160
are ways to experience the world

02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:23.720
to say that reason is the best tool

02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:24.360
but there's a difference

02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:25.880
between experiencing the world

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:28.440
and evaluating the world

02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:29.560
in terms of what is truth

02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:30.200
or what is not

02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:31.800
as a scientist I appreciate

02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:32.680
the value of reason

02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:34.200
and emotions and love

02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:35.960
are consequences

02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:37.320
they're not primary

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:39.320
emotions are consequences

02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:40.520
of conclusions you've come to

02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:41.720
your emotions will change

02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:44.520
very quickly relatively speaking

02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:45.800
when your evaluations

02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:47.400
of a situation will change

02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:48.440
different people can see

02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:49.560
exactly the same scene

02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:51.480
and have completely different emotions

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:52.520
because they're bringing

02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:53.720
different value systems

02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:54.440
and they're bringing

02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:56.280
different thoughts to the process

02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:57.480
maybe love is primary

02:21:57.480 --> 02:21:58.040
but let me ask

02:21:58.840 --> 02:21:59.720
love is the same thing

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:01.080
you can fall out of love with somebody

02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:02.520
why because you learn something new

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:03.880
because you've discovered

02:22:03.880 --> 02:22:05.080
something new about the person

02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:05.800
now you don't love them

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:07.480
the wrong podcast to bring up love

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:08.920
we'll talk forever about it

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:11.400
so you're you wrote the book

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:12.760
the virtue of nationalism

02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:15.320
contrasting nation states

02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:17.000
with empires and with global governance

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.760
like united nations and so on

02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:22.440
so you argue that nationalism

02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:23.960
uniquely provides the quote

02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:25.560
the collective right

02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:27.880
of a free people to rule themselves

02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:30.120
so continuing our conversation

02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:33.320
why is this particular

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:35.160
collection of humans

02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:36.200
we call a nation

02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:39.160
a uniquely powerful way

02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:41.160
to preserve the freedom of the people

02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:42.600
to have people rule themselves

02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:45.240
before I say anything on the subject

02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:47.000
I should emphasize that

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.360
I'm not a rationalist

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.040
I'm an empiricist

02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:52.200
and I'm offering what

02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:56.200
what I think is a valid observation

02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:58.200
of human history

02:22:58.200 --> 02:23:00.120
I don't have some kind of deductive framework

02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:01.240
for proving that

02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:03.160
you know that the nation is the best

02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:04.280
and empirically

02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:05.240
we know something about

02:23:05.240 --> 02:23:07.240
the way systems of national states work

02:23:07.240 --> 02:23:08.520
and about the way empires work

02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:10.280
and the way tribal societies work

02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:12.600
what we don't know is

02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:16.200
is it possible to invent something else

02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:17.160
or I mean there's a lot of things

02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:18.520
we don't know here

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:20.440
so with the caveat

02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:22.840
that I'm making an empirical observation

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:24.120
the basic argument is

02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:27.160
human beings form collectives

02:23:27.160 --> 02:23:29.080
naturally loyalty groups

02:23:29.720 --> 02:23:31.880
and from most of human history

02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:32.680
and prehistory

02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:34.440
as far as we know

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:36.360
human beings lived in tribal societies

02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:37.960
tribal societies are societies

02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:40.440
in which there's

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:43.800
constant friction

02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:45.080
and constant warfare

02:23:45.720 --> 02:23:47.080
among very small groups

02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:49.000
among families and clans

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:51.400
and we reach a turning point

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:52.360
in human history

02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:55.000
with the invention of large scale agriculture

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
which allows the creation of vast wealth

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.840
it allows the establishment

02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:00.280
of standing armies

02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:01.400
instead of militias

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:03.560
Sargon of Akkad says

02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:06.200
I can pay 5,000 men

02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:07.640
to do nothing other

02:24:07.640 --> 02:24:09.240
than to drill in the arts of war

02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:10.120
and then I'm going to send them out

02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:11.960
to conquer the neighboring city states

02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:13.000
and there you have empire

02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:16.040
the Bible which is the source

02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:18.120
of our image

02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:19.640
our conception of a world

02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:21.720
of independent nations

02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:23.000
that are not constantly

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.600
trying to conquer one another

02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:26.520
the source of that is the Bible

02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:30.040
and the biblical world

02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:31.320
is one in which

02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:37.960
Israel and various other small nations

02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:41.720
are trying to fight for their independence

02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:43.800
against world empires

02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:45.800
against empires Babylonian

02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:47.320
Assyrian, Persian, Egyptian

02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:49.400
which aspire to rule the world

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:54.840
my claim is fundamentally twofold

02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:56.760
it's moral

02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:58.840
that whenever you conquer

02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.040
a foreign nation

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:00.760
you're murdering

02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:01.560
and you're stealing

02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:03.480
you're destroying

02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:04.440
as your own would say

02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:09.720
you're using force to cause people to submit

02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:14.280
there is something in the prophets

02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.120
that rebels against this

02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:19.000
ongoing atrocity and carnage

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:20.760
of trying to take over the whole world

02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:25.240
and there's a prudential

02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:26.280
practical argument

02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:29.640
which is that the world is governed best

02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:31.800
when there are multiple nations

02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:33.560
when they're free to experiment

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:34.760
and chart their own courses

02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:38.520
that means they have their own route to God

02:25:38.520 --> 02:25:41.240
they have their own moralities

02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:42.680
they have their own forms

02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:44.360
of economy and government

02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:46.440
and what tends to happen in history

02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:49.400
is that when something is successful

02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:50.600
when something looks like

02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:52.520
when people a different nation looks at

02:25:52.520 --> 02:25:53.800
and say why those people are

02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:54.600
they're flourishing

02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:55.800
they're succeeding

02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:58.040
then it's imitated

02:25:58.040 --> 02:25:59.560
and you know in the way that

02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.800
you know the Dutch invented the stock market

02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:03.160
and the English said look

02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:04.760
that makes them powerful

02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:06.680
so we'll adopt it

02:26:06.680 --> 02:26:09.000
so that there's endless examples of that

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:10.680
so that's the argument for it

02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:14.600
the argument is since we don't know

02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:17.320
a priori deductively

02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:20.040
from self-evident principles

02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:20.760
what is best

02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:22.840
it's best to have a world

02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:24.920
in which people are trying different things

02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:26.360
so a quick question

02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:27.880
because the word nationalism

02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:30.600
sometimes is presented in negative light

02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:34.040
in connection to the nationalism

02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:35.560
of Nazi Germany for example

02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:39.560
so you're looking empirically

02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:42.440
at a world of nations

02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:43.880
that respect each other

02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:45.320
I use the word nationalism

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:47.000
the way that I inherited it

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.440
in my tradition

02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:50.840
which is it's a principled standpoint

02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:52.840
that says that the world is governed best

02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:57.640
when many nations are able to be independent

02:26:57.640 --> 02:26:58.680
and chart their own course

02:26:58.680 --> 02:26:59.400
that's nationalism

02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:00.920
as far as the Nazis

02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:02.520
Hitler's an imperialist

02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:04.040
he hated nation states

02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:05.000
his whole theory

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:05.640
if you pick up

02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:07.640
I don't recommend doing this

02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:08.760
but if you do

02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:09.800
actually reading it right now

02:27:09.800 --> 02:27:10.360
Mein Kampf

02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:11.800
right if you do read Mein Kampf

02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:14.040
then you'll see that he says explicitly

02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:16.360
that the goal is for Germany to be

02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:18.840
the lord of the earth

02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:20.440
and mistress of the globe

02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:22.680
and he detests the idea

02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:24.360
of the independent nation state

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:26.920
because he sees it as weak and effete

02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:28.440
he might as well have said it's Jewish

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:29.320
so let me ask

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:31.080
from the individual perspective

02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:33.800
for nationalism

02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:35.480
what do you make of the value

02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:37.000
of the love of country?

02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:40.120
the reason I connect that

02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:42.680
so I personally

02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:44.920
what would you say

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:45.880
a patriot

02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:48.200
I love the love of country

02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:49.640
or I am susceptible

02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:53.000
or how should in a Randian way

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.920
I enjoy I in a self-interest

02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:58.120
good love is a good word

02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:00.520
but well I love a lot of things

02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:01.160
but I'm saying

02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:02.120
this particular love

02:28:02.120 --> 02:28:03.960
is a little bit contentious

02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:05.560
which is loving your country

02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:07.640
that's an interesting love

02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:08.600
that some people

02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:10.040
are a little uncomfortable with

02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:12.760
even especially when that love

02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:13.960
I grew up in the Soviet Union

02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:17.960
to say you just love the country

02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:19.960
it represents a certain thing to you

02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:20.840
and it's not you don't think

02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:21.800
like philosophically

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:23.480
like I was marching around

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:25.880
with with like marks under my arm

02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:26.680
or something like that

02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:29.720
it's just loving community

02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:33.080
at the level of nation

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:33.880
it's very interesting

02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:35.240
I don't know if that's an artifact

02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:35.960
of the past

02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:38.360
that we're going to have to strip away

02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:41.080
I don't know if I was just raised

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:42.280
in that kind of community

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:43.160
but I appreciate that

02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:46.680
I guess the thing I'm torn about

02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:49.000
is that love of country

02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:51.160
that I have in my heart

02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:52.440
that I now love America

02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:54.280
and I consider myself an American

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.520
that would have easily

02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:58.120
if I was born earlier

02:28:58.120 --> 02:28:59.480
been used by Stalin

02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:01.720
and I would have proudly died

02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:03.080
on the battlefield

02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:04.600
I would have proudly died

02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:07.240
if I was in Nazi Germany as a German

02:29:07.240 --> 02:29:09.720
and I would proudly die as an American

02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:11.000
are you sure about these things

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.080
yes that's interesting

02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:14.520
no I think about this a lot

02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:15.560
it's interesting to run

02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:17.480
a radical counterfactual

02:29:17.480 --> 02:29:18.680
and be sure of the answer

02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:19.800
I mean I'm not sure

02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:21.720
I mean but I think about this a lot

02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:22.760
because obviously

02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:24.680
I'm really interested in history

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:25.480
and I put myself

02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:27.240
this is the way I think

02:29:27.240 --> 02:29:28.680
about most situations

02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:29.560
as I empathize

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.640
I really try to do hard work

02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:33.160
of placing myself in that moment

02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:35.080
and thinking through it

02:29:35.080 --> 02:29:36.040
I'm just okay

02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:37.800
I just know myself psychologically

02:29:37.800 --> 02:29:40.600
what I'm susceptible to

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:43.000
that's a negative way to phrase it

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.600
but what I would love doing

02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:47.160
and so I'm just saying

02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:47.880
my question is

02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:50.520
is the love of nation

02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:55.240
a useful or a powerful moral

02:29:57.080 --> 02:29:58.360
sort of from a moral philosophy

02:29:58.360 --> 02:30:00.360
perspective a good thing

02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:01.800
I think it is a good thing

02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:02.760
but before we ask

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:03.720
whether it's a good thing

02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:05.400
I think it's worth asking

02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:06.360
whether there's any way

02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:07.160
to live without it

02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:09.720
the idea of national independence

02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:12.520
of a world or a continent

02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:14.200
which politically is governed

02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:16.600
by multiple independent national states

02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:19.000
that is a political theory

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:20.600
somebody came up with that

02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:22.440
you know in the bible or elsewhere

02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:24.920
someone came up with this idea

02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:25.560
and sold it

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:26.680
and a lot of people like it

02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:31.160
but the nation is not an invention

02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:34.040
every place in human history

02:30:34.040 --> 02:30:35.480
that we have any record of

02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:37.400
there are nations

02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:42.360
and so the fact of

02:30:43.320 --> 02:30:45.080
people creating families

02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:46.600
families creating an alliance

02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:50.520
of clans

02:30:50.520 --> 02:30:52.360
clans creating alliances of tribes

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:54.200
tribes creating alliances

02:30:54.200 --> 02:30:57.960
of an alliance that becomes the nation

02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:01.320
we see that everywhere in human history

02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:02.200
everywhere we look

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:06.520
and the love of a group of tribes

02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:07.960
that have come together

02:31:07.960 --> 02:31:09.960
in order to fight opponents

02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:11.000
that are trying to destroy

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:11.880
your way of life

02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:14.680
and steal your land

02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:17.400
and harm your women and children

02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:22.600
the love of the leadership

02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:23.960
that brings it together here

02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:28.600
this is a George Washington type figure

02:31:28.600 --> 02:31:30.680
or an Alfred the Great type figure

02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:33.640
or Saul the biblical Saul

02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:36.280
somebody who has the wisdom

02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:38.520
the daring to unite the tribes

02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:43.640
overcome their internal mutual

02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:45.240
hatreds and grievances

02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:48.120
and rally them around a set of ideas

02:31:48.120 --> 02:31:49.320
a language a tradition

02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:53.640
an identity as people say today

02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:56.120
that love is irradicable

02:31:56.120 --> 02:31:56.920
from human beings

02:31:56.920 --> 02:31:58.120
maybe we'll have brave new world

02:31:58.120 --> 02:31:59.000
people will take drugs

02:31:59.000 --> 02:31:59.880
in order to get rid of it

02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:01.880
the problem is that could be leveraged

02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:03.320
by authoritarian or

02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:05.000
yes but that's true of everything

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:05.800
it's like saying

02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:07.080
you know you can have children

02:32:07.080 --> 02:32:08.280
and you can teach them to be evil

02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:09.880
you can make a lot of money

02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:11.000
you can use it for evil

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:12.680
you can have a gun for self-defense

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:14.040
but you can use it for evil

02:32:14.040 --> 02:32:15.960
come on that's human

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:16.840
that's being human

02:32:16.840 --> 02:32:18.680
but you guys are making love

02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:20.520
this primary which I don't think it is

02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:21.080
there are lots of people

02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:22.360
how dare you your honor

02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:23.400
I know there are lots of people

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:24.120
in the world that they

02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:25.320
who don't love their nation

02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:27.240
because the nation is not worth loving

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:28.920
that is love is conditional

02:32:28.920 --> 02:32:30.280
it's not unconditional

02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:32.200
love is conditioned on the value

02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:33.240
that's presented to you

02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:36.040
so I lived through this experience

02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:36.680
in my own life

02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:39.400
I grew up in Israel

02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:43.240
at a time of everything

02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:45.960
was geared towards patriotism

02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:46.840
and the state

02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:50.360
I would say I was trained

02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:52.040
to when I saw a grenade

02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:52.760
to jump on it

02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:54.680
because that was you know

02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:57.000
every song and every story

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.680
and everything was about

02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:01.320
the state is everything

02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:02.200
and you should sacrifice

02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:04.360
and you know when they flag went up

02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:05.880
I got teary-eyed

02:33:06.760 --> 02:33:08.440
I bought into it completely

02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:11.240
and at some point I rejected that

02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:12.920
and I changed

02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:13.960
and I changed my alliance

02:33:13.960 --> 02:33:16.120
and I rejected my love of Israel

02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:17.400
it's not that I don't love it anymore

02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:19.080
but it's certainly not my top love

02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:19.720
and it's certainly

02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:20.600
I'm certainly not looking

02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:21.720
for the grenade to jump on

02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:22.840
and I'm volunteering to go

02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:23.720
fight the war there

02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:27.080
and I fell in love from a distance

02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:29.560
with the idea of America

02:33:30.120 --> 02:33:31.560
I love the idea of America

02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:33.000
more than I love America

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.360
right and I could see myself

02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:35.080
falling in love

02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:36.200
out of love with America

02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:37.400
given where it's heading

02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:39.000
right it's it's not automatic

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.840
it's it's it's conditioned on

02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:42.440
what it is that it represents

02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:43.400
and what it is

02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:44.680
what value it represents

02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:47.400
for me you know

02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:48.440
and and I think that's

02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:49.800
that's always the case with love

02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:51.720
you know it's not true

02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:53.640
that children have to love

02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:54.280
their parents

02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:56.440
that's the ideal

02:33:56.440 --> 02:33:57.320
and and hopefully

02:33:57.320 --> 02:33:58.520
most children love their parents

02:33:58.520 --> 02:33:59.160
because their parents

02:33:59.160 --> 02:34:00.920
but some children fall out of love

02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:01.480
with their parents

02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:02.440
because their parents

02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:03.560
don't deserve their love

02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:05.640
and the same with this

02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:06.840
is the same with the other way around

02:34:06.840 --> 02:34:07.960
I think I think parents

02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:09.080
are capable of not loving

02:34:09.080 --> 02:34:09.800
their children

02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:11.560
so it's it's love is

02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:12.520
is a conditional thing

02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:13.400
it's not automatic

02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:14.840
but but let me let me point out

02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:15.960
an agreement with

02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:16.680
let me say something about

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:17.160
an agreement

02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:17.960
you're trying to bribe me

02:34:17.960 --> 02:34:18.680
with an agreement

02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:22.280
to soften the blow right

02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:23.560
mostly I like to talk

02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:24.760
to your own about his ideas

02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:25.480
and I don't want to talk

02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:26.360
about Ayn Rand

02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:27.720
but I want to say something

02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:29.480
just just one one thing

02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:30.280
about Ayn Rand

02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:32.600
all my kids all my kids

02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:34.600
read Ayn Rand's books

02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:36.200
my father read The Fountainhead

02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:37.560
I don't know like I'm you know

02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:40.360
like we we know Ayn Rand

02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:43.640
and I'll tell you

02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:45.960
it is incredibly difficult

02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:46.680
reading for me

02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:48.040
it's it's it's painful

02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:49.080
it's painful to read

02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:50.600
why is it painful

02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:52.920
not because I disagree

02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:54.840
with the with with the view

02:34:54.840 --> 02:34:56.360
of of trading

02:34:56.360 --> 02:34:57.320
and business

02:34:57.320 --> 02:34:58.680
and the creativity of it

02:34:58.680 --> 02:34:59.560
and and you know

02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:00.840
and and Reardon Medal

02:35:00.840 --> 02:35:02.200
I mean I you know that stuff

02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:04.280
that stuff moves me

02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:05.640
and and and and and

02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:07.160
and I do admire it

02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:10.040
but to read you know

02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:12.280
a book that's a thousand pages long

02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:14.280
in which nobody

02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:16.680
nobody is having children

02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:19.160
nobody is having a stable marriage

02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:21.640
no one is running a

02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:23.400
an admirable government

02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:25.160
that's fighting for a just cause

02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:26.440
anywhere anywhere

02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:28.680
you're on I I feel

02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:30.600
I just I feel like like

02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:34.040
it's focusing on one aspect

02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:35.640
of what it is to be human

02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:36.680
and to flourish

02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:37.960
and that everything else

02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:39.160
is just erased

02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:40.200
and thrown out

02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:41.960
as though it's just not part of reality

02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:42.680
and I'm scared

02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:44.600
I'm scared of what happens

02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:46.120
to to to teenagers

02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:48.520
who hormonally are in any case

02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:50.440
know that that's the program

02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:52.440
to to to pull away

02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:53.480
from their parents

02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:54.600
and experiment with things

02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:56.520
that they're they're biologically

02:35:56.520 --> 02:35:58.440
programmed to do that

02:35:58.440 --> 02:35:59.800
and you give them a book

02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:01.240
which says look

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:03.000
you you don't

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:04.120
you don't have to have a family

02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:05.320
you don't have to raise children

02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:06.440
you don't have to have a country

02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:08.040
you don't have to fight for anything

02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:09.400
all you have to do

02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:11.480
is assert yourself in trade

02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:14.200
I I think it's destructive

02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:16.120
because it's not realistic

02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:17.320
it's just not real

02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:18.840
but I got none of that from Ayn Rand

02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:21.160
I got none of that from Ayn Rand

02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:23.240
you know the the the books

02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:24.200
were not about a family

02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:25.880
you could write a book

02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:27.880
in in Ayn Rand style about

02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:30.200
where people have a family

02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:32.600
but the goal the purpose

02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:33.400
it's a novel

02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:34.920
it's not it's a novel

02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:36.200
which is delimited

02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:37.320
with the particular story

02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:39.160
there's one family in Galt's Gulch

02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:40.680
and there's a little passage

02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:41.640
about raising children

02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:42.520
and the value of that

02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:44.920
because it's not core

02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:47.160
to what she is writing about

02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:48.520
but that doesn't exclude it

02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:49.800
I know when I read Ayn Rand

02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:51.400
I read Atlas Shrugged when I was 16

02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:52.840
and I read it over

02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:53.720
over the years

02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:54.840
several times more

02:36:54.840 --> 02:36:55.880
it never occurred to me

02:36:55.880 --> 02:36:57.160
oh Ayn Rand's anti-family

02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:58.040
I shouldn't have a family

02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:01.080
that thought never came into my mind

02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:02.520
I always wanted to have children

02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:03.960
I continue to want to have children

02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:06.600
I thought of it a little differently

02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:08.360
I thought of how I would find a partner

02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:09.320
a little bit differently

02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:10.200
I thought about

02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:11.960
what I would look for in a partner

02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:13.480
differently

02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:15.160
but not that I wouldn't want

02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:15.640
to get married

02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:17.320
one question I have is

02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:19.240
what effect has on society

02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:20.760
so outside of you

02:37:20.760 --> 02:37:21.960
so for example you mentioned

02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:23.080
love should be conditional

02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:23.880
I think well it is

02:37:23.880 --> 02:37:25.480
whether you like it or not it is

02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:26.840
you might pretend that it isn't

02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:27.800
but it's always conditional

02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:29.240
well let me try to say something

02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:30.760
and see if it makes any sense

02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:35.160
so could there be things that are true

02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:36.680
like love is conditional

02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:38.120
is always conditional

02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:40.040
that if you say it often

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
it has a negative effect on society

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:43.960
so for example

02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.800
I mean so maybe I'm just a romantic

02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:49.000
but good luck saying

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.320
love is conditional to a romantic partner

02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:53.000
I mean you could

02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:55.320
I would argue en masse

02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:57.880
that would deteriorate

02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:59.640
the quality of relationships

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.400
if you remind the partner

02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:07.160
of that truth that is universal

02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:08.680
like you have to the

02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:11.080
I mean okay maybe it's just me

02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:12.280
I'll just speak to myself

02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:13.320
it's like there's a certain

02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:15.800
romantic notion of unconditional love

02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:16.680
it's part of why

02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.800
you have so many destructive marriages

02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:20.920
it's part of why

02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:22.040
so you would say that's a problem

02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:23.880
yes it's a real problem

02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:27.240
because yes there is a

02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:29.480
you all talked about honoring your spouse

02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:31.000
and there's a real truth there

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.760
and I respect that

02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:35.240
yes you have to do certain things

02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:36.200
love is not

02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:37.000
you marry somebody

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:38.680
and there's a real attitude out there

02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:39.080
in the culture

02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:39.720
you marry somebody

02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:41.000
and okay now we're going to

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:42.280
we're just going to cruise

02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:42.760
it's just

02:38:42.760 --> 02:38:43.960
right Hollywood

02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:44.840
that's the Hollywood marriage

02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:46.040
you know marriage is work

02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:49.400
like all values it's work

02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:50.520
it's something you have to

02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:51.560
reignite every day

02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:52.040
you have to

02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:53.320
the challenges

02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:55.160
the real disagreements

02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:58.680
the things you fight about

02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:00.040
you disagree about

02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:01.320
and there's real

02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:02.520
if it's a value

02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:03.400
you work it out

02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:05.400
you struggle through it

02:39:06.840 --> 02:39:08.440
and sometimes you struggle through it

02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:09.720
and you come to a conclusion

02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:11.640
nah this is not going to work

02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:12.920
and you dissolve a marriage

02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:14.600
and I'm all for dissolving

02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:16.840
after really really fighting for it

02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:18.440
because if it's an important value

02:39:18.440 --> 02:39:20.440
and if you fell in love with this person

02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:21.320
for a reason

02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:23.240
then that's something worth fighting for

02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:25.160
I have a feeling that Hollywood goes the other way

02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:27.480
but it's not this cruising along

02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:29.000
and everything is easy

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.520
no human relationship is like that

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:31.320
not friendship

02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:31.880
not love

02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:34.200
not raising children

02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:35.240
not being a child

02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:38.360
they require work

02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:39.640
and they require thinking

02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:42.120
and they require creating the conditions

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:43.800
to thrive

02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:46.280
and that's the sense in which it's conditional

02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:47.560
you have to work at it

02:39:48.120 --> 02:39:52.520
and it's very easy

02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:54.200
not to do the work

02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:55.800
and it's very easy to drift away

02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:57.160
and I think most people don't do the work

02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:58.280
most people take it

02:39:58.280 --> 02:39:59.320
and generally in life

02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:01.960
the only place people seem to work

02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:02.600
is at work

02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:05.000
and then they take the rest of their life

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:05.960
as I'm going to cruise

02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:08.520
and yet every aspect of your life

02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:10.120
the art you choose

02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:11.400
the friends you choose

02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:12.520
the lovers you choose

02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:15.160
all require real thinking

02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:16.120
and real work

02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:18.280
to be successful at them

02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:21.560
none of them are just there

02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:24.280
because there is no such thing as just the intrinsic

02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:25.800
right I agree with all of that

02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:26.760
I was going to say before

02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:28.040
that the rabbis have this

02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:30.600
sort of shocking expression

02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:37.960
the pain of raising children

02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:41.720
I find when I speak to audiences

02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:43.080
about relationships

02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:45.480
I find that in general

02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:47.560
this is cross-cultural

02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:48.760
it's different countries

02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:50.440
different religious backgrounds

02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:51.560
that in general

02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:54.120
young people do not know

02:40:54.680 --> 02:40:57.320
that the only way to make a marriage work

02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:00.440
is through a lot of pain and overcoming

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:03.480
they don't know that raising children

02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:04.920
involves a great deal of pain

02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:07.640
they don't know that caring for

02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:09.480
and helping your parents

02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:10.760
approach the end of their lives

02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:13.080
causes a great deal of pain

02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:16.200
everything is kind of this sketchy

02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:17.480
you know very sketchy

02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:18.520
glimpsey kind of

02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:19.480
and I mentioned Hollywood

02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:23.880
just because everything is made to look easy

02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:25.720
except you know there's kind of a funny breakdown

02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:27.320
of something but then it you know

02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:28.680
maybe there's a divorce

02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:29.720
you know they shoot one another

02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:31.560
so then they should get divorced

02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:37.320
but the reality of how hard it is to do

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.880
and how heroic it is to do it

02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:42.840
and then overcome

02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:44.600
and then actually in the end

02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:47.240
achieve something create something

02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:48.360
that there was really

02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:50.920
it's almost it's almost not

02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:52.120
it's almost not discussed

02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:53.400
and so I look to me

02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.400
it's just not surprising that

02:41:56.920 --> 02:41:59.480
if there's no parallel to Ayn Rand

02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:02.440
about you know the heroic saving

02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:03.880
of a marriage that was on the rocks

02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:05.000
how does it actually happen?

02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:09.080
It's a good point you're making

02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:11.480
and but it's something just came to me

02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:12.600
that I've never thought of before

02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:13.800
so that's always good

02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:15.400
this is where conversation is good

02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:20.120
look take the Talmud in the Bible

02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:21.400
I can't remember how many years

02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:23.400
after the Bible the Talmud is written

02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:25.800
how many over how long of a period it's written

02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:27.640
how many people participating in writing it

02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.480
Ayn Rand was one individual

02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:31.960
she wrote a series of books on philosophy

02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:33.880
which I think are true

02:42:33.880 --> 02:42:35.480
and and but they're the beginning

02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:37.560
there's a lot of work to be done

02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:39.800
it's it to apply this

02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:42.840
so hopefully there will be one of her students

02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:44.200
who writes a book on relationships

02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:47.080
and there'll be a somebody

02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:48.840
who writes a book on on developing

02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:50.680
her political theory in greater detail

02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:52.200
and develop her ethics

02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:53.640
she's got like she's got

02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:55.080
she's got a few writings on ethics

02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:56.040
and it's in the novels

02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:58.360
but but there's a lot of work to be done

02:42:58.360 --> 02:42:59.080
fleshing it out

02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:00.120
what does it mean how do you

02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:03.000
so to say Ayn Rand didn't do everything

02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:04.680
is a truism

02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:05.560
she didn't do everything

02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:07.000
okay so what

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.880
but she laid this amazing philosophical foundation

02:43:09.880 --> 02:43:12.200
that allows us to take those principles

02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:16.040
and to apply them to all these realms of human life

02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:17.560
and she does it on a scope

02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:19.400
that few philosophers in human history have done

02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:20.040
because she does

02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:21.960
goes from metaphysics all the way to aesthetics

02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:23.240
hitting the key

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:24.520
and she's an original thinker

02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:25.720
on each one of those things

02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:28.120
and she might be right

02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:29.880
she might be wrong on certain aspects of it

02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:32.040
always happy to have a debate

02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:33.480
about where where she's wrong

02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:34.680
or where she's not

02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:36.440
but there's a lot of work to be done

02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:37.960
right it's not like

02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:40.200
and and if if if there were objectivists out there

02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:41.640
who presented as

02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:43.000
okay human knowledge is over

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:44.200
because Ayn Rand wrote these books

02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:45.240
that's absurd

02:43:45.240 --> 02:43:48.120
right this huge amount of work to be done

02:43:48.120 --> 02:43:49.960
in applying these particular ideas

02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:51.720
just like they was for any philosophy

02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:53.160
take these ideas

02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:54.920
and now apply them to all these realms

02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:56.360
in human experience

02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:58.200
that flesh it out and make it

02:43:58.200 --> 02:43:59.240
and one of the reasons

02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:01.400
I don't think objectivism is taken off

02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:03.720
is because there's all this work still to be done

02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:05.800
that allows it to be relatable

02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:08.120
to people in every aspect of them

02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:10.040
let me ask a hard question here

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:10.840
we've we've got

02:44:10.840 --> 02:44:11.240
we've taken

02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:12.760
can I say what I agreed with you on Mark?

02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:14.280
Sure sure this is good

02:44:14.280 --> 02:44:15.400
it's a bigger transition

02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:17.320
this is the clip

02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:19.000
this is what this is the clip

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.600
I mean I agree about nations

02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:22.920
so I don't like the term nationalism

02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:24.440
because I I fear

02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:25.800
what happens when you put an ism

02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:27.640
at the end of any word

02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:28.520
anything yes

02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:31.480
but the nation is is a good thing

02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:34.120
and having a diversity of nations

02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:35.400
in a sense is a good thing

02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:36.120
and in this sense

02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:37.240
in this sense

02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:38.760
I don't think one can come up

02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:40.920
so look I I said

02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:43.400
I hold that the ideal nation

02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:45.320
is a nation that protects individual rights

02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:47.160
how do you do that?

02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:49.160
what are the details?

02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:50.440
how do we define property rights

02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:51.800
exactly in an internet world?

02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:53.960
there's going to be disagreement

02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:56.360
rational reasonable disagreement

02:44:56.360 --> 02:44:56.920
they're going to be

02:44:57.640 --> 02:44:59.560
in my future

02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:00.760
in the 300 years from now

02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:03.000
in my ideas of one finally right

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:04.520
there will be multiple nations

02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:05.960
trying to apply the principle

02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:07.240
of applying individual rights

02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:08.680
and they'll do it differently

02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:10.200
one of their one of the benefits

02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:10.920
of federalism

02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:12.520
is that while you have

02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:13.720
a national government

02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:14.760
there are certain issues

02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:15.960
that you relegate to states

02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:17.720
and they can try different things

02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:18.760
and learn

02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:21.240
because there is a huge value

02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:23.320
in empirical knowledge comes there

02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:25.000
you can't just deduce it all

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:25.960
and figure it all out

02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:27.400
you have to experiment

02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:29.720
so I do I hate the idea

02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:31.640
of a one world one world government

02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:34.360
because experimentation is gone

02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:35.720
and if you make a mistake

02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:37.160
everybody suffers

02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:38.200
I like the idea

02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:39.560
and then I like the idea of people

02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:40.920
being able to choose

02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:42.440
where they live

02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:46.040
but this notion of experimentation

02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:47.000
I think is crucial

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:48.200
but you need a principle

02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:50.200
you need a principle

02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:51.720
so I don't like the idea of nations

02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:53.000
if all the nations are going to be

02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:54.760
bad right

02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:56.760
if all the nations are going to be horrible

02:45:56.760 --> 02:45:57.880
then I don't like it

02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:00.120
what I like is a variety of nations

02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:01.000
all practicing

02:46:01.720 --> 02:46:03.720
basically good ideas

02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:05.000
and then we try to figure out

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:06.760
okay what works better than other things

02:46:06.760 --> 02:46:08.600
and what is sustainable

02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:09.640
and what is not

02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:12.440
given how many difficult aspects

02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:14.440
of history and society

02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:15.160
we've talked about

02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:16.360
let me ask a hard question

02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:17.080
of both of you

02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:19.560
breeze up until now

02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:20.060
yeah

02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:23.560
what gives you hope

02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:24.600
about the future

02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:26.760
so we've been describing

02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:30.680
reasons to maybe not have hope

02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:32.840
what gives you hope

02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:34.120
when you look at the world

02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:35.960
what gives you hope

02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:37.320
that in 200 years

02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:38.200
and 300 years

02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:39.080
and 500 years

02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:41.640
like the founders look into the future

02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:45.320
that human civilization will be all right

02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:46.360
and more than that

02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:47.640
it would flourish

02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:48.600
two things for me

02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:50.680
one is history

02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:52.520
so in the very long run

02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:53.560
good ideas win out

02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:56.600
I think in the very long run

02:46:56.600 --> 02:46:57.880
you can go through a dark ages

02:46:57.880 --> 02:46:59.240
but you come out of a dark ages

02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:04.280
the good and the just

02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:06.120
does win in the end

02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:07.320
even if it is bloody

02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:08.040
and difficult

02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:09.800
and hard to get there

02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:11.560
so while I am quite pessimistic

02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:13.480
unfortunately about the short run

02:47:13.480 --> 02:47:14.840
I'm ultimately optimistic

02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:16.520
that in the long run

02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:17.640
good ideas win

02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:18.680
and they're justified

02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:20.680
and I think the fundamental

02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:22.280
behind that is

02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:25.400
I think is that

02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:26.680
I'm fundamentally positive

02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:27.640
about human nature

02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:29.080
I think human beings

02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:31.160
can think

02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:33.160
they're capable of reasoning

02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:36.280
they're capable of figuring out the truth

02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:38.440
they're capable of learning from experience

02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:39.880
they don't always do it

02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:41.480
it's an achievement to do it

02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:43.480
but over time they do

02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:47.320
and if you create the right circumstances

02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:48.040
they will

02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:49.560
and when things get bad enough

02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:51.880
they look for way out

02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:54.040
they look at maybe at history

02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:55.560
if the history is available to them

02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:01.080
maybe at just learning from what's around them

02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:03.000
to find better ways of doing things

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:04.760
and that reinforces itself

02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:09.000
but human beings are an amazing creature

02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:11.000
we're just amazing

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:12.520
in our capacity to be creative

02:48:12.520 --> 02:48:13.880
in our capacity to think

02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:15.160
in our capacity to love

02:48:15.160 --> 02:48:17.080
in our capacity to change our environment

02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:17.960
to fit our needs

02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:19.720
and to fit our requirements for survival

02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:21.320
and to learn

02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:22.360
and to grow

02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:23.480
and to progress

02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:27.720
and so again long term

02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:29.240
I think all that wins out

02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:30.040
short term

02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:31.320
in any point in history

02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:31.880
short term

02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:36.120
right now it doesn't look too good

02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:38.600
What about you?

02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:44.040
Well as usual I moved by what Euron says

02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:47.160
and I hear scripture

02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:51.640
and the source for Euron's hope

02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:55.880
is the book of Exodus

02:48:56.840 --> 02:48:59.640
which is the first place in human history

02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:03.160
where we are presented with the possibility

02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:05.960
that an enslaved people

02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:07.240
that's being persecuted

02:49:07.240 --> 02:49:07.800
and murdered

02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:09.800
and living under the worst possible regime

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:12.360
can free itself

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:14.360
and have a shot

02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:16.120
at a life of independence and worth

02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:20.280
and it's another inherited Jewish idea

02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:22.120
in the tradition

02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:26.120
the way that we express this

02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:29.720
is by saying that there is a God who judges

02:49:31.880 --> 02:49:33.480
the Israelites in Egypt

02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:36.520
were enslaved for hundreds of years

02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:38.040
according to the Exodus story

02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:39.640
hundreds of years before God wakes up

02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:42.040
and hears them

02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:43.640
and he doesn't do anything until

02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:47.640
Moses kills the oppressor

02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:49.560
and goes out into the desert

02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:53.720
so I think it's pretty realistic

02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:55.880
that there is a God

02:49:55.880 --> 02:49:57.480
that God judges and acts

02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:00.520
but probably often

02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:02.040
not for a very very long time

02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:04.280
and not until there's a human being

02:50:04.280 --> 02:50:05.880
who gets up and says enough

02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:07.960
I know that today people

02:50:07.960 --> 02:50:09.160
don't want to read the Bible

02:50:09.160 --> 02:50:11.000
they don't like reading the Bible

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.440
but I always hear in my ear

02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:17.320
this cry of the prophet Jeremiah

02:50:17.320 --> 02:50:21.320
who saw his nation destroyed

02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:23.400
and his people exiled

02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:25.080
and he says

02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:28.040
in God's name

02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:31.400
he says he's not my word like fire

02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:34.360
like the hammer that shatters rock

02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:36.120
a patishim and a petzela

02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:39.160
my word is like fire

02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:40.760
like the hammer that shatters rock

02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:42.760
and this is actually

02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:44.040
this is the traditional way

02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:44.760
of saying something

02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:45.960
like what Yaron is saying

02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:48.600
that it may take a long long time

02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:51.080
but there is a truth

02:50:51.080 --> 02:50:52.840
and it has its own strength

02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:54.760
and it will in the end

02:50:55.640 --> 02:50:58.360
shatter the things that are opposing it

02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:00.440
that's our traditional hope

02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:02.200
we grow up like that

02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:07.480
and you know so I do have hope

02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:08.520
I see the trends

02:51:08.520 --> 02:51:10.120
the trends are terrible right now

02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:14.600
and it's frightening and it's hard

02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:17.160
but we are terrible at seeing the future

02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:19.160
and it is very possible

02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:21.480
that an unexpected turn of events

02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:22.760
is going to appear

02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:25.080
you know maybe soon

02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:26.280
maybe much later

02:51:26.280 --> 02:51:30.200
and the possibility of a redemption

02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:32.860
is there.

02:51:32.860 --> 02:51:34.280
Let me ask

02:51:34.280 --> 02:51:35.960
given that long arc of history

02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:37.720
given that you do study the Bible

02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:42.440
what is the meaning of this whole thing

02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:43.640
what's the meaning of life

02:51:44.680 --> 02:51:45.720
Wow that's beautiful

02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:48.760
I think that the meaning of life is

02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:54.040
is in part what Yaron touches on

02:51:54.040 --> 02:51:55.640
when he says that

02:51:58.040 --> 02:51:59.080
that productive work

02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:01.400
labor creativity is at the heart

02:52:01.400 --> 02:52:02.600
of what it is to be human

02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:07.800
I just think that there are some more arenas

02:52:07.800 --> 02:52:09.960
and maybe we even agree with a lot of them

02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:11.560
and I on a lot of them

02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:15.960
to be human is to inherit a world

02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:17.480
which is imperfect

02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:20.040
terribly imperfect

02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:21.240
imperfect in many ways

02:52:21.880 --> 02:52:26.760
and God created it that way

02:52:26.760 --> 02:52:28.120
he created a world

02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:29.560
which is terribly lacking

02:52:30.520 --> 02:52:31.880
and he created us

02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:34.680
with the ability to stand up

02:52:34.680 --> 02:52:35.480
and to say

02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:38.520
I can change the direction of this

02:52:38.520 --> 02:52:39.560
I can do something

02:52:39.560 --> 02:52:40.920
to change the direction of this

02:52:40.920 --> 02:52:42.680
I can take the time

02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:44.600
and the abilities that are given to me

02:52:44.600 --> 02:52:45.960
to be a partner with God

02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:47.240
in creating the world

02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:50.440
it's not going to stay the way it was before me

02:52:50.440 --> 02:52:52.520
it'll be something different

02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:54.600
maybe a little bit

02:52:54.600 --> 02:52:55.320
maybe a lot

02:52:56.280 --> 02:52:59.080
but that is the heart

02:52:59.080 --> 02:52:59.880
that is the key

02:52:59.880 --> 02:53:02.040
that is the meaningful life

02:53:02.040 --> 02:53:03.800
is to be a partner with God

02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:05.400
in creating the world

02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:08.120
so that it is moving that much more

02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:09.320
in the right direction

02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:11.960
rather than the way we found

02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:14.200
so nudge even if a little bit

02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:15.480
the direction of the world

02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:18.680
well you're on

02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:21.080
you've actually been talking

02:53:21.080 --> 02:53:22.840
and you program about life quite a bit

02:53:24.520 --> 02:53:26.040
so let me ask the same question

02:53:26.680 --> 02:53:29.160
and I never tire you asking this question

02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:34.760
what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing

02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:36.280
I mean I don't believe in God

02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:38.200
so God doesn't play a role

02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:41.960
in my view of the meaning of life

02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:43.400
I think the meaning of life is to live

02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:46.520
I like to say to live with a capital L

02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:49.720
it's to embrace it

02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:52.600
and I agree with your arm in a sense

02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:54.040
we're born into a world

02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:55.080
and as human beings

02:53:55.880 --> 02:53:57.880
one of the things that makes us very different

02:53:57.880 --> 02:53:58.680
than other animals

02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:00.440
is our capacity to change that world

02:54:01.080 --> 02:54:02.440
we can actually go out there

02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:03.960
and change the world around us

02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:05.640
we can change it materially

02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:07.800
through production and through

02:54:07.800 --> 02:54:09.640
we can change it spiritually

02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:11.720
through changing the ideas of people

02:54:11.720 --> 02:54:13.400
we can change the direction

02:54:13.960 --> 02:54:15.480
to which humanity works

02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:18.760
we can create a little universe

02:54:19.960 --> 02:54:21.800
I think part of the joy of creating a family

02:54:21.800 --> 02:54:23.560
is to create a little universe

02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:26.360
we're creating a little world around us

02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:28.040
that's part of the joy

02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:29.960
and there is joy in family

02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:32.520
let's not make it all about difficulty and hard work

02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:33.800
I agree

02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:37.080
part of the idea of getting married

02:54:37.080 --> 02:54:38.840
is to create a little world

02:54:38.840 --> 02:54:40.520
in which you and your spouse

02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:41.480
are creating something

02:54:41.480 --> 02:54:42.760
that didn't exist before

02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:44.760
and building something

02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:45.800
building a universe

02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:46.760
but it's really to live

02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:49.480
I mean one of the things that I see

02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:52.120
and that saddens me is wasted lives

02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:55.640
it's people who just cruise through life

02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:59.320
they get born in a particular place

02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:00.280
they never challenge it

02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:01.160
they never question

02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:03.320
they just you know

02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:05.560
they live die and nothing really happened

02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:06.440
nothing really changed

02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:07.160
they didn't produce

02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:08.920
they didn't make anything of their life

02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:10.120
and produce here again

02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:11.800
again in the in the largest sense

02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:15.160
so to me it's it's an every aspect of life

02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:16.120
you know as you know

02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:17.080
because you've listened to my show

02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:17.640
I love arts

02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:18.760
I love aesthetics

02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:20.840
I love the experience of great arts

02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:23.480
you know I love relationships

02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:26.280
I you know I I love producing them

02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:27.960
you know I like business

02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:29.720
I like that that aspect of it

02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:32.680
and and I think I think people

02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:34.120
people are shallow

02:55:34.120 --> 02:55:36.120
in in so many parts of their lives

02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:37.000
which saddens me

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:38.120
I mean if we if we

02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:39.480
if you had eight billion people

02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:40.200
in this planet

02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:42.120
even if it never grew

02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:43.800
even if we just stayed at eight billion

02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:45.480
but the eight billion all lived

02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:47.480
fully wow

02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:49.960
I mean what an amazing place

02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:50.600
this would be

02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:51.720
what an amazing experience

02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:52.440
we would have

02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:54.120
so so to me that is

02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:55.640
the meaning is just make the most

02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:57.480
that you have a short period of time on earth

02:55:58.600 --> 02:55:59.320
and and that's it

02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:00.040
this is it

02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:01.080
and and live it

02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:02.280
experience it fully

02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:03.480
and and challenge yourself

02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:04.680
and push yourself

02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:07.080
and and let me just say something about optimism

02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:09.480
you know one source of hope for me

02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:11.320
in the world in which we live right now

02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:14.120
is that there are people who do that

02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:16.200
at least in certain realms

02:56:16.200 --> 02:56:17.640
of of their lives right

02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:18.840
and and I'm inspired

02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:21.480
and and I know a lot of people

02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:22.360
don't like me for this

02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:23.560
but I'm inspired for example

02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:24.360
by Silicon Valley

02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:26.280
in spite of all the the political disagreements

02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:27.640
I have with them and all of that

02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:28.840
I'm inspired by people

02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:30.840
inventing new technologies

02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:32.280
and building I'm inspired by

02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:33.480
by the people you talk to

02:56:33.480 --> 02:56:35.000
about artificial intelligence

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:36.760
and about about new ideas

02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:39.000
and about pushing the boundaries of science

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:40.520
those things are exciting

02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:42.280
and it's it's terrific to see a world

02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:44.120
that I think generally is in decline

02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:45.720
yet there are these pockets

02:56:45.720 --> 02:56:47.880
in which people are still creating

02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:49.560
new uh new ventures

02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:50.280
and new ideas

02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:50.840
and new things

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:52.920
that that inspires me

02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:53.640
and it gives me hope

02:56:53.640 --> 02:56:54.600
that that is not dead

02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:56.520
that in spite of the decay

02:56:56.520 --> 02:56:57.320
that's in our culture

02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:58.760
there's still pockets where

02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:01.080
that spirit of being human

02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:03.320
is still is still alive and well

02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:05.240

02:57:05.240 --> 02:57:07.000
yeah and they truly live

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:08.040
with the capital L

02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:11.080
and maybe I can do on a star

02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:13.640
maybe you can also put a little bit of love

02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:15.800

the only thing necessary

for the triumph of evil

02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:51.400
