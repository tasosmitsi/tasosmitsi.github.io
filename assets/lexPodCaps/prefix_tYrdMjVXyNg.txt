00:00.000 --> 00:01.700
Something has to happen with Iran.

00:01.700 --> 00:04.300
There has to be some diplomatic bilateral communication there.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.600
No, what has to happen is the containment of Iran.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.200
History moves in one direction.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.200
Right.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.200
Because of time?

00:10.200 --> 00:14.300
Communism, Nazism, all of that was a regression from what was happening at, for example,

00:14.300 --> 00:16.300
the beginning of the 19th century and the 20th century.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.700
In what way?

00:17.700 --> 00:20.000
Do you think that today Donald Trump knows that he lost the election?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Absolutely.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.300
So I don't.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.000
This is one of the areas where we get into this.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
I don't understand if there's like brain breaking happening or what's going on.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.500
I don't know what world we can ever live in where we say that Trump is less divisive

00:32.500 --> 00:33.900
for the country than Biden.

00:33.900 --> 00:38.100
Joe Biden literally used the Occupational Safety and Hazard Administration to try to

00:38.100 --> 00:40.900
cram down vax mandates on 80 million Americans.

00:40.900 --> 00:41.900
That's insane.

00:41.900 --> 00:42.900
What about supercalifragilisticexpialine?

00:42.900 --> 00:43.900
What about pneumo-ultra-microscopics?

00:43.900 --> 00:45.900
Yeah, or the science terms.

00:45.900 --> 00:46.900
Yeah, exactly.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.300
Or what about the 7,000 letter thing that's from part of biochemistry?

00:49.300 --> 00:53.700
I got my education in the Soviet Union, so we just did math.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.700
That's why you're a useful person.

00:54.700 --> 00:59.200
Does this body count matter?

00:59.200 --> 01:04.600
The following is a debate between Ben Shapiro and Destiny, each arguably representing the

01:04.600 --> 01:08.400
right and the left of American politics, respectively.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.880
They are two of the most influential and skilled political debaters in the world.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.800
This debate has been a long time coming, for many years.

01:16.800 --> 01:23.600
It's about 2.5 hours, and we could have easily gone from many more, and I'm sure we will.

01:24.100 --> 01:27.180
It is only round one.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.780
This is the Lex Freeman podcast.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.860
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:31.860 --> 01:35.900
And now, dear friends, here's Ben Shapiro and Destiny.

01:35.900 --> 01:38.500
Ben, you're a conservative.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.520
Destiny, you're a liberal.

01:40.520 --> 01:45.820
Can you each describe what key values underpin your philosophy on politics and maybe life

01:45.820 --> 01:48.900
in the context of this left-to-right political spectrum?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.700
You want to go first?

01:51.600 --> 01:57.400
I think that we have a huge country full of a lot of people, a lot of individual talents,

01:57.400 --> 02:02.280
capabilities, and I think that the goal of government, broadly speaking, should be to

02:02.280 --> 02:06.040
try to ensure that everybody's able to achieve as much as possible.

02:06.040 --> 02:10.480
So on a liberal level, that usually means some people might need a little bit of a boost

02:10.480 --> 02:12.800
when it comes to things like education.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.840
They might need a little bit of a boost when it comes to providing certain necessities

02:15.840 --> 02:20.600
like housing or food or clothing, but broadly speaking, I mean, I'm still a liberal, not

02:20.600 --> 02:21.600
a communist or a socialist.

02:21.600 --> 02:27.920
I don't believe in the total command economy, total communist takeover of all of the economy,

02:27.920 --> 02:31.580
but I think that, broadly speaking, the government should kick in and help people when they need

02:31.580 --> 02:32.580
it.

02:32.580 --> 02:35.000
And that government can and should be big?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.300
Not necessarily.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.900
I notice that when liberals talk about government, especially taxes, it seems like they talk

02:39.900 --> 02:43.740
about it for taxes' sake or bigness' sake.

02:43.740 --> 02:48.140
So people talk about taxes sometimes as like a punishment, like tax the rich.

02:48.160 --> 02:53.120
I think taxing the rich is fine insofar as it funds the programs that we want to fund,

02:53.120 --> 02:56.600
but Democrats have a really big problem demonizing success or wealth.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.120
And I don't think that's a bad thing.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.440
I don't think it's a bad thing to be wealthy, to be a billionaire or whatever, as long as

03:01.440 --> 03:03.240
we're funding what we need to fund.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.900
Ben, what do you think it means to be a conservative?

03:05.900 --> 03:08.000
What's the philosophy that underlies your political view?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.120
So first of all, I'm glad that Destiny you're already coming out as a Republican.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.120
That's exciting.

03:12.780 --> 03:19.860
We hold a lot in common in terms of the basic idea that people ought to have as much opportunity

03:19.860 --> 03:27.440
as possible and also insofar as the government should do the minimum amount necessary to

03:27.440 --> 03:32.780
interfere in people's lives in order to pursue certain functions, particularly at the local

03:32.780 --> 03:33.780
level.

03:33.780 --> 03:37.500
So a lot of governmental discussions on a pragmatic level end up being discussions about

03:37.500 --> 03:41.160
where government ought to be involved, but also at what level government ought to be

03:41.160 --> 03:42.880
involved.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.920
And I have an incredibly subsidiary view of government.

03:45.920 --> 03:52.280
I think that local governments, because you have higher levels of homogeneity and consent,

03:52.280 --> 03:54.160
are capable of doing more things.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.640
And as you abstract up the chain, it becomes more and more impractical and more and more

03:57.640 --> 04:00.240
divisive to do more things.

04:00.240 --> 04:06.160
In my view, government is basically there to preserve certain key liberties.

04:06.160 --> 04:12.140
Those key liberties pre-exist the government insofar as they are more important than what

04:12.140 --> 04:14.100
priorities the government has.

04:14.100 --> 04:20.020
The job of government is to maintain, for example, national defense, protection of property

04:20.020 --> 04:23.380
rights, protection of religious freedom.

04:23.380 --> 04:26.780
These are the key focuses of government as generally expressed in the Bill of Rights

04:26.780 --> 04:28.220
and the Constitution.

04:28.220 --> 04:31.420
And I agree with the general philosophy of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.500
Now that doesn't mean, by the way, that you can't do more on a governmental level, again,

04:34.520 --> 04:37.720
as you get closer to the ground, which, by the way, is also embedded in the Constitution.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.960
People forget the Constitution was originally applied to the federal government, not to

04:40.960 --> 04:42.840
local and state governments.

04:42.840 --> 04:46.440
But if I were going to define conservatism, it would actually be a little broader than

04:46.440 --> 04:49.320
that, because I think to understand how people interact with government, you have to go to

04:49.320 --> 04:51.080
kind of core values.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.440
And so for me, there are a couple of premises.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.000
One, human beings have a nature.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.320
That nature is neither good nor bad.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.120
We have aspects of goodness and we have aspects of badness.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.400
Human beings are sinful.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.940
We have temptations.

05:02.940 --> 05:07.040
And what that means is that we have to be careful not to incentivize the bad and that

05:07.040 --> 05:08.760
we should incentivize the good.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.520
Human beings do have agency and are capable of making decisions in the vast majority of

05:12.520 --> 05:17.360
circumstances and it is better for society if we act as though they do.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.520
Second, the basic idea of human nature.

05:20.520 --> 05:25.760
There is an idea, in my view, that all human beings have equal value before the law.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.000
I'm a religious person, so I'd say equal value before God, but I think that's also sort of

05:29.000 --> 05:32.640
a key tenet of Western civilization being non-religious or religious, that every individual

05:32.640 --> 05:36.820
has equivalent value in sort of cosmic terms.

05:36.820 --> 05:40.120
But that does not necessarily mean that every person is equally equipped to do everything

05:40.120 --> 05:41.120
equally well.

05:41.120 --> 05:45.180
And so it is not the job of government to rectify every imbalance of life.

05:45.180 --> 05:49.780
The quest for cosmic justice, as Thomas Sowell suggests, is something that government is

05:49.780 --> 05:54.880
generally incapable of doing and more often than not botches and makes things worse.

05:54.880 --> 06:00.260
So those are a few key tenets and that tends to materialize in a variety of ways.

06:00.260 --> 06:03.940
The easiest way to sum that up would be the traditional kind of three legs of the conservative

06:03.940 --> 06:07.380
stool, although now obviously there's a very fragmented conservative movement in the United

06:07.380 --> 06:12.820
States, would be a socially conservative view in which family is the chief institution of

06:12.820 --> 06:19.140
society, like the little platoons of society, as Edmund Burke suggested, in which free

06:19.140 --> 06:26.060
market and property rights are extraordinarily valuable and necessary because every individual

06:26.300 --> 06:33.300
has the ability to be creative with their property and to freely alienate that property.

06:33.860 --> 06:37.740
And finally, I tend toward a hawkish foreign policy that suggests that the world is not

06:37.740 --> 06:41.220
filled with wonderful people who all agree with us and think like us.

06:41.220 --> 06:46.300
And those people will pursue adversarial interests if we do not protect our own interests.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.820
Can I ask a question on that?

06:47.820 --> 06:48.820
I'm so curious.

06:48.820 --> 06:49.820
Okay.

06:49.820 --> 06:53.760
I'm excited for this conversation because I consider you to be really intelligent.

06:53.760 --> 06:57.600
But I feel like sometimes there are ways that conservatives talk about certain issues that

06:57.600 --> 07:01.080
seem to defy logic and reason, I guess.

07:01.080 --> 07:06.960
And I'm sure you feel the same way about progressives, but even some liberals for sure.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.260
Before I ask this question, it's going to relate to education.

07:09.260 --> 07:15.840
We can agree, broadly speaking, that statistics are real and that not everybody could do everything.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.520
So for a grounded example, my life was pretty bad.

07:18.520 --> 07:22.160
I got into streaming and I turned my life around and that was really cool, but I can't

07:22.200 --> 07:25.080
expect everybody to do what I did, right?

07:25.080 --> 07:27.800
Like everybody being able to join the NBA or to be like a streamer.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.800
Of course.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.800
Everybody has different qualities.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
Sure.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.800
Okay.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.880
So I used to be a lot more libertarian when I was 20, 21.

07:33.880 --> 07:38.360
And one of the things that dramatically changed kind of my view on government manipulation

07:38.360 --> 07:43.880
of things in the, I guess, in society came when it came time to deal with my son and

07:43.880 --> 07:45.480
the school that he went to.

07:45.480 --> 07:49.080
And one of the things that I noticed was when it came time to send my son to school, I could

07:49.080 --> 07:51.240
either do private education or I could do public.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.280
Personally, I did 12 years of Catholic private education.

07:54.280 --> 07:58.680
However, the public schools in Nebraska, depending on where you lived, were very, very, very

07:58.680 --> 07:59.680
good.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.320
And I opted for a certain district.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
I bought a house there.

08:02.320 --> 08:05.360
I moved there and then my son was able to go to those schools.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.000
And he's been going through those schools.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.240
And the difference of availability of like technology, like these kids are taking home

08:11.240 --> 08:16.200
iPads and like first grade, they've got like huge computer labs and everything.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.800
Do you think that there is some type of, I don't want to say injustice or unfairness

08:20.800 --> 08:24.760
because I'm not even looking at it that way, just pragmatically, that there might be children

08:24.760 --> 08:30.840
that are in certain schools that if they just had better funding or more access to technologies

08:30.840 --> 08:35.000
or things available to them, that those kids would become more productive members of society

08:35.000 --> 08:38.160
that would like a little bit of a help that they could actually achieve more and do better

08:38.160 --> 08:39.340
for all of society.

08:39.340 --> 08:43.280
So I think that on the list of priorities, when it comes to education, the availability

08:43.280 --> 08:45.760
of technology is actually fairly low on the list of priorities.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.760
Sure.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.000
The two things I've heard are food availability and I think air conditioning, I think are

08:50.000 --> 08:51.280
the two biggest ones that I hear about.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.280
Sure.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.040
I mean, the biggest thing in terms of education itself, not just the physical facilities that

08:55.040 --> 09:01.480
we're talking about, would actually be two parent, family, households, communities that

09:01.480 --> 09:05.160
have fathers in them, is actually the number one, Decisor, according to Roland Fryer and

09:05.160 --> 09:07.360
many studies done on this particular topic.

09:07.360 --> 09:12.840
And the idea that money alone, that investment of resources is the top priority in schooling

09:12.840 --> 09:16.640
is belied by the fact that LAUSD, which is where I went to school when I was younger,

09:16.640 --> 09:19.080
they pour an enormous amount of money into LAUSD.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.800
We're talking about tens of thousands of dollars very often per student, and it does

09:22.800 --> 09:25.880
not result in better schooling outcomes.

09:25.880 --> 09:31.000
And so when you say, if we could give every kid an iPad, would you give every kid an iPad?

09:31.000 --> 09:34.640
The question is not, if I had a replicator machine from Star Trek, would I give everybody

09:34.640 --> 09:35.640
an enormous amount of stuff?

09:35.640 --> 09:37.080
Sure, I would.

09:37.080 --> 09:41.800
Every resource is finite, every resource is limited, and you have to prioritize what are

09:41.800 --> 09:47.280
the outcomes that you seek in terms of the means with which you are seeking them.

09:47.280 --> 09:52.320
And so, again, I think that the question is, I quibble with the premise of the question,

09:52.320 --> 09:57.000
which is that, again, the chief injustice when it comes to education on the list of

09:57.000 --> 10:01.880
injustices is lack of availability to technology or that it's a funding problem.

10:01.880 --> 10:02.880
I just don't think that's the case.

10:02.880 --> 10:03.880
Sure.

10:03.880 --> 10:08.040
And I can half agree with you there, but I don't think any amount of changes in the schools

10:08.040 --> 10:10.240
will create two-parent households, right?

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
We can't bring a...

10:11.240 --> 10:12.240
I totally agree with you.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.240
So...

10:13.240 --> 10:16.080
That's why I think that the fundamental educational problem is not, in fact, a schooling problem.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.360
I think that it pre-exists that.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.360
Sure.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.360
But then I feel like we're...

10:19.360 --> 10:22.560
Now, I feel like this is kind of the conservative merry-go-round where it's like, what can we

10:22.560 --> 10:24.360
do to help with schools?

10:24.360 --> 10:27.720
So two of the things that I've seen, I think, that are usually brought up in research is,

10:27.720 --> 10:32.640
one is air conditioning, that children in hotter environments just don't learn as well.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.160
And then the second one is access to food.

10:34.160 --> 10:38.240
So kids that are given breakfast or lunch that's provided at school increases educational

10:38.240 --> 10:39.240
outcomes.

10:39.240 --> 10:43.400
Now, I agree that neither of these things might be determinative in, well, 20% of kids

10:43.960 --> 10:48.320
are graduating, 80% of kids are graduating, or these kids are all going with their GEDs

10:48.320 --> 10:51.320
into the workforce, and now these kids are all suddenly becoming engineers.

10:51.320 --> 10:55.600
But in terms of where we can help, do you think there should be some minimum threshold

10:55.600 --> 11:00.520
or minimum baseline of like, at the very least, every school should have a non-leaky gym?

11:00.520 --> 11:04.600
Or every school should have, if children can't afford lunch or breakfast, some sort of food

11:04.600 --> 11:05.600
provided?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.480
Or every school should have these baseline things?

11:07.480 --> 11:11.120
So again, I'm going to quibble at the premise of the question, because I think when it comes

11:11.120 --> 11:16.200
to, for example, food insecurity, school food programs, again, you can always pour

11:16.200 --> 11:19.160
money into any program and at the margins create change.

11:19.160 --> 11:22.920
I mean, there's no doubt that pouring money onto anything will create change in a marginal

11:22.920 --> 11:23.920
way.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.800
The question is, how large is the margin and how big is the movement?

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
Right?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.280
So the delta is what I'm looking at.

11:28.280 --> 11:33.360
And so I think that you're starting at a second order question, which is, what if we ignore

11:33.360 --> 11:37.880
what I would think are the big primary questions of education, namely, family structure, value

11:37.880 --> 11:42.120
of education at home, how much you have parents who are capable or willing to help with homework?

11:42.120 --> 11:45.160
What are the incentive structures we can set up for a society that actually facilitate

11:45.160 --> 11:46.160
that?

11:46.160 --> 11:49.080
How local communities take ownership of their schools is a big one, right?

11:49.080 --> 11:52.680
All of these issues we're ignoring in favor of, say, air conditioning or lunch programs.

11:52.680 --> 11:57.120
And so in a vacuum, if you say air conditioning and lunch programs, sounds great in a vacuum.

11:57.120 --> 12:02.000
In terms of prioritization of values and cost structure, are those the things that I think

12:02.000 --> 12:05.960
are going to move the needle in a major way in terms of public policy?

12:05.960 --> 12:06.960
I do not.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.360
And in fact, I think that many of them end up being disproportionate wastes of money.

12:11.360 --> 12:15.360
I've talked before pretty controversially about the fact that an enormous amount of

12:15.360 --> 12:19.600
school lunch programs are thrown out, like an enormous amount of that food ends up in

12:19.600 --> 12:20.680
the garbage can.

12:20.680 --> 12:21.840
Is there a better way to do that?

12:21.840 --> 12:24.380
If there is a better way to do it, then I'm perfectly willing to hear about that better

12:24.380 --> 12:25.380
way to do it.

12:25.380 --> 12:29.300
But it seems to me that one of the big flaws in the way that many people of the left approach

12:29.300 --> 12:32.520
government is what if we hit every now with a hammer?

12:32.520 --> 12:36.840
And my question is, what if the net isn't even the problem?

12:37.720 --> 12:41.000
What if there is a much bigger substructure problem that needs to be solved in order to

12:41.000 --> 12:45.080
if you're shifting deck chairs on the Titanic, sure, you can make the Titanic slightly more

12:45.080 --> 12:47.920
balanced because the deck chairs are slightly better oriented.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.920
But the real question is the water that's gaping into the Titanic, right?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.260
Yeah, and I agree with you 100%.

12:53.260 --> 12:57.240
But again, I feel like we're on the conservative merry-go-round then of never wanting to address

12:57.240 --> 12:58.240
that.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.240
That's not a conservative merry-go-round.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.240
I can give you 10 ways.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.240
Well, sure.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.240
But so like here would be the merry-go-round.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.440
I would say that like there is a minimum funding for schools that I think would help children.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.640
And then we go, well, the thing that would help them the most is two-parent households.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.680
And then I go, OK, well, two-parent households actually aren't the problem.

13:09.680 --> 13:13.600
The issue is access to things like birth controls that people don't have children early on.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.120
But the issue isn't actually birth control.

13:15.120 --> 13:18.880
The issue is actually you need a certain amount of money to move out early and to get married

13:18.880 --> 13:20.120
and then to have a two-parent household.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.920
So it's actually like economic opportunity.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.040
No, no, just two-parent households.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.040
That's it.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.040
Yeah, but like what are the precursors?

13:26.040 --> 13:27.040
Don't fuck people before you're married and have babies.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.040
Sure.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.040
Done.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.040
That's great.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.920
We can say that and try to fight against, you know, however many hundreds of thousands

13:31.920 --> 13:34.480
of years of human evolution, but people will have sex and people will make babies.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.840
And then they used to get married.

13:35.840 --> 13:39.200
The vast majority of people in this country with kids used to be married.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.240
The vast majority of people with kids in this country now are not married increasingly.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.240
That is obviously a societal change.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.240
Something changed.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.240
It wasn't human evolution.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.760
But a lot of those things in terms of resting on whether or not people get married have

13:49.760 --> 13:51.280
to do with financial decisions.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
Do you have the money?

13:52.280 --> 13:54.920
People are worse off now than they were 50, 60 years ago when the marriage rates were higher.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.960
People are delaying the start of their careers because education is becoming increasingly

13:57.960 --> 13:58.960
important.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.260
So in other words, people are richer now and they have more education now and yet they're

14:02.260 --> 14:05.200
having more babies out of wedlock now because they're richer and have more education.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.600
I'm saying that the one of the biggest indicators for whether or not somebody is willing to

14:08.600 --> 14:11.960
get married is how much money both people are making if they can move out of their household.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.880
People don't tend to want to get married at 22 when they've just finished college, when

14:14.880 --> 14:16.900
they don't have the money to move out and they can't afford a house because we have

14:16.900 --> 14:20.600
changed the moral status of marriage in the culture, meaning that everyone poor, rich

14:20.600 --> 14:22.720
and in between used to get married.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.240
That is, by the way, a huge percentage of marriages in the United States used to be

14:25.240 --> 14:28.120
what they would call shotgun marriages, meaning that somebody knocked somebody up and because

14:28.120 --> 14:31.320
they did not want the baby to be born outside of a two parent household, they would then

14:31.320 --> 14:32.320
get married.

14:32.320 --> 14:36.680
Do you think that shotgun marriages, though, are a way to bring back equilibrium to education?

14:36.680 --> 14:37.680
Yes.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.680
Yes.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.680
Absolutely.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.680
Yes, 100%.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.680
Do we think that-

14:41.680 --> 14:42.680
A child deserves a mother and a father.

14:42.680 --> 14:43.680
Sure.

14:43.680 --> 14:44.680
Because that is the basis for all of this, including education.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.680
Do we think that shotgun marriages are, well, let's say this, do we think that that's a reasonable

14:48.680 --> 14:50.360
direction that society would ever take?

14:50.360 --> 14:53.040
Or is this like it was the reasonable direction for nearly all of modern history?

14:53.040 --> 14:55.400
It was, but history moves in one direction, right?

14:55.400 --> 14:56.400
Why?

14:56.400 --> 14:57.400
Because of time?

14:57.400 --> 14:59.920
I mean, people don't think that, in what way is that?

14:59.920 --> 15:03.600
And I don't think we've ever like regressed social standards back to like, oh, well, let's

15:03.600 --> 15:06.400
go 100 years back and do things that, you know, used to exist before.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.400
That's weird.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.240
The entire left right now is arguing that we regressed social standards by rejecting

15:09.240 --> 15:11.320
Roe versus Wade, so that's obviously not true.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.240
The Roe versus Wade is not a social standard, it's a Supreme Court ruling, number one.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.800
Number two, if you read the actual majority of opinion on Roe v. Wade, we can see that

15:17.800 --> 15:22.160
socially we actually never made huge progress on how society viewed abortion.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.640
This has always been an incredibly divisive thing, right?

15:24.640 --> 15:28.320
Even that was, I think, part of Alito's writing on it was that things like gay marriage, for

15:28.560 --> 15:32.040
we've kind of moved past and it's not really as debated anymore, but abortion was never

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
a subtle topic.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.480
The notion in the arc of history constantly moves in one direction is belied by nearly

15:37.480 --> 15:39.480
all of the 20th century.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
What do we mean by that?

15:40.480 --> 15:45.240
I mean, I mean, women's rights, civil rights, barbarism, communism, Nazism, all of that

15:45.240 --> 15:48.760
was a regression from what was happening at, for example, the beginning of the 19th century

15:48.760 --> 15:49.760
in the 20th century.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.760
What, in what way?

15:50.760 --> 15:54.720
Nazism and communism were a regression from what was going on in 1905?

15:54.760 --> 15:58.960
Well, in terms of like communism being a regression, for instance, I'm not a communist, but like

15:58.960 --> 16:02.200
the industrialization of the Soviet Union happened under a communist society.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.200
The industrialization-

16:03.200 --> 16:04.200
Murder of tens of millions of people.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.200
It did.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.200
Yeah.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.200
I consider that a regression.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.640
A moral regression, which is what we are talking about now, moral regression.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.680
And you're suggesting that moral regression, I wouldn't term a return to traditional values

16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
in moral regression.

16:14.680 --> 16:15.680
You would.

16:15.680 --> 16:18.120
But your suggestion is that history only moves in one direction.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.920
And I'm suggesting that history does not only move in one direction, it tends to move actually

16:21.920 --> 16:22.920
back and forth.

16:22.920 --> 16:23.920
Sure.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.680
I think that the history moves in one direction.

16:25.680 --> 16:26.680
They're going to be wars.

16:26.680 --> 16:27.680
They're going to be times of peace.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.480
I think in general, we're more peaceful now than we have been in the past.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.920
But I think when we look at the way that people live their lives, I think that we tend to

16:33.920 --> 16:35.920
move in a certain direction socially.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.920
So when it comes to things like racism or when it comes to things like slavery or women's

16:38.920 --> 16:42.200
rights, I think that there are two huge things that probably aren't changing in the U.S.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.560
And one is access to contraception and one is women working jobs.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.200
I think that these two things are probably huge things that are moving us off of shotgun

16:49.200 --> 16:51.560
marriages or getting married very early on.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.200
Do you think that those two things are going to change fundamentally?

16:54.200 --> 16:58.560
First of all, what the data tend to show is that actually more highly educated people,

16:58.560 --> 17:00.560
as you were saying, tend to get married more.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.640
So the idea is that women getting an education somehow throws them off marriage.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.640
It's the opposite.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.560
But those women aren't getting shotgun marriages.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.560
Those women aren't having children.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.080
Yeah, but now you're shifting the topic.

17:11.080 --> 17:14.680
My topic was how to get more people married.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.560
And then you suggested that higher levels of education are delaying marriage and making

17:18.560 --> 17:19.560
it less probable.

17:19.560 --> 17:23.280
And what I'm telling you, because this is what the data suggests, is that actually

17:23.280 --> 17:28.080
as you raise up the the educational ladder, people tend to be married more than they are

17:28.080 --> 17:29.600
lower down on the educational ladder.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.560
If you're a high school graduate, you're less likely to be married than if you're a postdoc.

17:33.560 --> 17:34.560
I agree with you.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.640
But that's because one of the biggest precursors to getting married is having like a level

17:37.640 --> 17:38.640
of economic stability.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.240
So as people get more educated, they obtain this economic stability.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.280
And then they're in a more comfortable position to explore more serious relations.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.280
There's another confound there.

17:44.280 --> 17:48.680
I mean, the confound is that people in stable marriages tend to be the children of stable

17:48.720 --> 17:51.880
marriages. And there's only one way to break that cycle, which is to create a stable marriage.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.760
And that is something that is in everyone's hands.

17:53.920 --> 17:58.240
Again, this notion that it is somehow an unbreakable, unshatterable barrier to get married

17:58.240 --> 18:01.240
and have kids. I don't understand where this is coming from.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.920
Why is that such a why is that such a challenge?

18:02.920 --> 18:05.120
I don't think it's unbreakable or unshatterable.

18:05.120 --> 18:10.640
I was just the initial point was for school, if we can provide a minimum level of educational

18:10.640 --> 18:12.320
stuff for children, that'd probably be good.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.920
But when we retreat back to, well, it has to be the families that are fixed first.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.480
Fixing families is a multivariate problem.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.760
Listen, I am fine within my local community.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.960
We all vote. Again, I've suggested that there's a difference in local community and federal.

18:24.480 --> 18:28.560
I'm fine with my local community voting for school lunches or air conditioning or whatever

18:28.560 --> 18:32.320
it is that we all agree to do, because the more local you get, the more homogeneity you

18:32.320 --> 18:34.480
get in terms of interest and the more interest you have in your neighbors.

18:34.640 --> 18:38.000
All of that's fine. I'm part of a very, very solid community in our community.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.720
We give to each other. We have minimum standards of helping one another.

18:40.920 --> 18:45.600
Oh, that's wonderful. When it comes to the actual problem of education, what I object

18:45.600 --> 18:50.120
to in the political sphere, and this happens all the time, is everybody is arguing on top

18:50.120 --> 18:55.960
of the iceberg about how we can move the needle point five percentage point as opposed

18:55.960 --> 18:58.640
to the entire iceberg melting beneath them.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.640
And we just ignore that. We pretend that that's just, you know, sort of the natural consequence

19:01.640 --> 19:04.200
of thing. The arc of history suggests that people are never going to get married again.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.640
Well, I mean, actually, what the arc of history suggests, realistically speaking, is that

19:07.640 --> 19:10.000
the people who are not getting married are not going to be having kids.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.120
And what it also suggests, the people who are married are going to be having kids.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.160
And so the demographic profile actually over time is rather going to shift toward people

19:17.160 --> 19:18.360
who are having lots and lots of kids.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.120
I'm married. I have four kids.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.840
Everyone in my community is married.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.960
It's like minimum buy in my community is four kids.

19:24.280 --> 19:28.560
OK, and so what's happening actually in terms of demographics is that the people who are

19:28.560 --> 19:30.720
more religious and getting married are having more kids.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.760
And so if you're talking about the arc of history shifting toward me, I would suggest

19:33.760 --> 19:37.800
that actually demographically over time, long periods of time, not over one generation,

19:37.920 --> 19:41.080
over long periods of time, the only cure for low birthrate is going to be the people who

19:41.080 --> 19:42.120
get married and have lots of kids.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.760
Yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with any of that, but I'm just saying that again, on

19:46.760 --> 19:50.280
the Europe side, when I bring up the term merry-go-round, I think that there are good

19:50.280 --> 19:54.440
conversations to be had about people getting married because stable families produce

19:54.440 --> 19:56.880
stable children that are less likely to commit crime, that are more likely to go to school,

19:56.880 --> 19:58.480
that are more likely to be productive members of society, et cetera, et cetera.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.880
I'm not going to disagree with you on any of that.

19:59.880 --> 20:00.640
All of that is true.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.080
It's just frustrating that sometimes when you bring up any problem, all of it will circle

20:05.080 --> 20:08.960
back to other things that makes it seem like we can't make any progress in any area

20:08.960 --> 20:09.680
without, like, fixing.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.480
In what way? I mean, I literally just told you that on the local level, I'm fine with

20:12.480 --> 20:13.080
people voting for air conditioning.

20:13.080 --> 20:16.480
Yeah, but so, for instance, on the local level, so for school funding, school funding is

20:16.480 --> 20:18.800
done, I think, generally per district.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.640
So what do you do when you have poor districts that can't afford air conditioning for

20:21.640 --> 20:22.160
their schools?

20:23.120 --> 20:29.440
I mean, the idea there would be that presumably if the society, meaning the state and I

20:29.440 --> 20:31.920
generally don't mean the federal state, I mean, like the state of California, for

20:31.920 --> 20:34.840
example, decides that everybody ought to have air conditioning, people will vote for

20:34.840 --> 20:36.320
air conditioning, and that's perfectly legal.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.960
And I don't think there's anything morally objectionable about that, per se.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.880
I also don't think that that's going to heal anything remotely like the central

20:42.880 --> 20:46.720
problem. And I think that what tends to happen in terms of government is people love

20:46.720 --> 20:50.360
arguing about the problems that can be solved by opening a wallet and nobody likes to

20:50.360 --> 20:59.080
solve a problem by, you know, closing their sex life to one person, for example, or

20:59.080 --> 21:02.720
having kids within a stable religious community, like the things that actually build

21:02.760 --> 21:07.440
society. I'm fine with arguing about each of these policies and whether we apply them

21:07.440 --> 21:10.640
or not is a matter generally of pragmatism, not morality.

21:10.640 --> 21:14.440
It's a matter of incentive structures, not, per se, morality, because incentive

21:14.440 --> 21:16.640
structures do have moral underpinnings.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.080
There's such a thing as, you know, for example, if you're going to use a welfare

21:19.080 --> 21:22.240
program, you have to decide how effective it is to what crowd it applies, where the

21:22.240 --> 21:24.360
cutoffs are. Does it disincentivize work?

21:24.360 --> 21:27.400
Does it not? All of these are pragmatic concerns.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.560
But on a moral level, the generalized objection that I have to people on the left

21:31.560 --> 21:35.440
side of the aisle is that they like to focus in these conversations.

21:35.440 --> 21:39.800
Very often it feels as though it's a conversation with people who are drunk

21:39.800 --> 21:42.320
searching under the lamp for their keys.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.200
The problems they want to look at are the problems that are solved by government and

21:45.200 --> 21:47.640
then all the problems they don't want to look at, which are the actual giant

21:47.640 --> 21:50.960
monsters lurking in the dark and not particularly solvable by government, are

21:50.960 --> 21:53.760
the ones they want to ignore and assume are just the natural state of things.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.680
And I don't think that's correct.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.200
And I one billion percent agree.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.800
And then obviously my criticism for the conservative side is the exact opposite

21:58.800 --> 22:01.600
where where there are parts where government could remedy some issues.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.160
For instance, you know, children having sex with each other and producing other

22:05.160 --> 22:08.720
children out of wedlock. Like sometimes having afterschool programs is nice to

22:08.720 --> 22:11.040
prevent that. Like I didn't have time for these things when I was in school.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.080
I was doing football practice. I was doing cross-country practice.

22:13.080 --> 22:16.640
I went in early for a band. You know, I agree with you that sometimes people only

22:16.640 --> 22:19.560
focus on one end of the problem as a I hate to be that guy.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.640
But as somebody that have you ever watched The Wire?

22:21.960 --> 22:24.720
Sure. I'm not going to cite The Wire as real life example, but like obviously

22:24.720 --> 22:28.240
there's only so much you can do in a school when the children coming in are so

22:28.240 --> 22:31.200
beyond destroyed because of the family life and everything prior to them even

22:31.200 --> 22:32.880
getting to school that day. So I agree.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.000
Government is not like the solution to broken families.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.720
That would never be the case.

22:36.720 --> 22:41.280
And it's actually not the solution to education depending on the kind of

22:41.280 --> 22:43.480
solutions that you're talking about. Some solutions. Yes. Some solutions.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.240
No. Yeah. So the only thing I'm looking at is, as I said earlier, just like these

22:46.240 --> 22:48.560
minimum threshold things where it's like, where can government make?

22:48.560 --> 22:50.760
Because you mentioned marginal, which I think is a really good way to look at

22:50.760 --> 22:53.480
things. There are marginal costs and marginal utility to things where the

22:53.480 --> 22:57.440
first thousand dollars per student you spend might give you a huge return, but

22:57.440 --> 23:00.320
the extra 20,000 after, I think these are all pragmatic discussions.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.120
And actually, this is what we used to hash out in legislatures before they

23:03.120 --> 23:05.640
turned into platforms for people grandstanding. But yes, sure.

23:05.640 --> 23:09.640
OK, yeah. As we descend from the heavens of philosophical discussion of

23:09.640 --> 23:13.640
conservatism and liberalism, let's go to the pragmatic muck of politics.

23:14.760 --> 23:19.800
Trump versus Biden, between the two of them, who was in their first term

23:20.560 --> 23:25.120
the better president and thus who should win if the two of them are, in fact,

23:25.120 --> 23:28.000
our choices should win a second term in 2024.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.840
Ben. Sure.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.440
So in terms of actual job performance, you have to separate it into a few

23:35.440 --> 23:39.800
categories in terms of actual performance in foreign policy.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.920
I think Trump's foreign policy record is significantly better than Biden's the

23:42.920 --> 23:46.400
world being on fire right now, being a fairly good example of that.

23:47.040 --> 23:50.160
And we can get into each aspect of the world being on fire and where the

23:50.160 --> 23:53.120
incentive structures came from and how all of that happened in a moment when it

23:53.120 --> 23:56.400
comes to the economy. I think that Trump's economic record was better than

23:56.400 --> 23:58.000
Biden's. Doesn't mean he didn't overspend.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.200
He did. He wildly overspend.

24:00.200 --> 24:04.080
But he also had a very solid record of job creation.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.080
A huge percentage of the gains in the economy went to people on the lower end

24:08.080 --> 24:09.320
of the economic spectrum.

24:09.320 --> 24:13.960
Actually, the gross income to the average American was about six thousand

24:13.960 --> 24:17.680
dollars during his term. The unemployment rates were very, very low before

24:17.680 --> 24:20.720
covid. I think that you almost have to separate the Trump administration into

24:20.760 --> 24:23.440
sort of before covid and during covid because covid obviously is sort of a

24:23.440 --> 24:28.440
black swan event, the most signal change in politics in our lifetime.

24:28.840 --> 24:32.560
And so governance during covid is almost its own category, which we can discuss.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.920
But in terms of foreign policy, in terms of domestic policy, I think that Trump

24:35.920 --> 24:38.400
was significantly better than Biden has been.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.960
And that's on the upside for Trump.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.480
On the downside for Biden, obviously, you're talking 40-year highs in

24:42.480 --> 24:44.680
inflation. You're talking about savings being eaten away.

24:44.680 --> 24:48.000
You're talking about everything being 20 to 30 percent more expensive.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.880
You're talking about massive increases to the deficit, even at a rate that was

24:51.880 --> 24:55.720
unknown under Trump, the deficit under Trump raised by about a little under a

24:55.720 --> 24:57.600
trillion dollars every year up until 2020.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.840
Again, 2020 was covid year.

24:58.840 --> 25:01.040
So everybody decided that we're going to fire hose money at things.

25:01.680 --> 25:06.000
But then Joe Biden continued to fire hose money at things in 21, 22 and 23.

25:06.920 --> 25:10.240
That obviously is, in my opinion, bad economic policy.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.120
And then you get to the rhetoric and you get to the stuff that Donald Trump says.

25:14.280 --> 25:18.920
And as I've said before, my view is that on Donald Trump's epitaph, on his

25:18.920 --> 25:20.800
gravestone, it will say Donald Trump, he said a lot of shit.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.440
I think that Donald Trump does say a lot of things.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.720
I think that that is basically baked into the cake, which is why everyone who's

25:27.720 --> 25:31.320
bewildered by the polls is ignoring human nature, which is at the beginning,

25:31.400 --> 25:33.680
when you see something very shocking, it's very shocking.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.600
And then if you see it over and over and over and over for years on end, it is no

25:36.600 --> 25:38.960
longer shocking. It is just part of the background noise like tinnitus.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.080
It just becomes something that your brain adjusts for.

25:42.640 --> 25:45.160
And so do I like a lot of Donald Trump's rhetoric?

25:45.360 --> 25:46.640
No, and I never have.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.320
Do I think that that is just positive as to his presidency?

25:49.440 --> 25:50.640
No, I do not.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.080
When it comes to Biden, again, I think he's underperforming economically.

25:54.080 --> 25:57.280
I think that his foreign policy has been really a problem.

25:57.600 --> 26:01.040
Even the things I think he's done right are, I think, band-aids for things that he

26:01.040 --> 26:02.160
created by doing wrong.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.760
And when it comes to his his own rhetoric.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.040
You can argue that it's grading on a curve because Trump was coming in with such

26:10.040 --> 26:13.200
wild rhetoric that just a maintenance of that wild rhetoric doesn't really change

26:13.200 --> 26:15.080
again the baseline for Biden.

26:15.400 --> 26:19.360
He came in in the same way that Obama did on the sort of soaring rhetoric of

26:19.360 --> 26:21.560
American unity. I'm the president for all like Trump came in.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.520
He's like, listen, I'm the president for what I am.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.680
And I'm going to say the things I want to say, I'm beyond the toilet.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.720
I'm tweeting. We're like, OK, you know, that's what it is with Biden.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.600
He came in with I'm a president for all Americans.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.000
I'm trying to unify everybody.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.920
And that pretty quickly broke down into a lot of oppositional language

26:36.120 --> 26:39.440
about his political opponents in particular and attempt to lump in, for

26:39.440 --> 26:43.480
example, huge swaths of the conservative movement with the people

26:43.480 --> 26:47.400
who participated, for example, in January 6th or who are fans of January 6th.

26:48.120 --> 26:51.920
And, you know, the sort of lumping in of everybody into

26:51.920 --> 26:55.440
MAGA Republicans who wasn't personally signed on to an infrastructure bill with

26:55.440 --> 26:58.320
him. That sort of stuff, I think, has been truly terrible.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.040
I thought his Philadelphia speech was truly terrible.

27:00.400 --> 27:05.480
And again, I think that you do have the problem of he is no longer capable

27:05.480 --> 27:09.680
of certainly rhetorically unifying the country when every speech from him

27:09.680 --> 27:12.600
feels like watching Nick Malinda walk across a volcano on a tightrope.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.160
And it really is like you're just sort of waiting for him to follow.

27:16.160 --> 27:20.400
I mean, it's it's sad to say, I mean, the other day he was speaking for what was,

27:20.400 --> 27:22.640
in effect, his campaign kickoff.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.280
And this is in Valley Forge.

27:24.280 --> 27:28.440
And I mean, Jill rushed up there like off that off as soon as he was done.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.880
Jill rushed up there, you know, like she'd been shot out of a cannon

27:32.040 --> 27:33.360
to come and try and guide him away.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.200
So he didn't become the Shane Gillis Roomba.

27:35.440 --> 27:39.880
And, you know, that's not really, you know, let's put it this way.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.080
It does not quiet the soul to watch Joe Biden rhetorically.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.920
Again, that's a different problem than Trump's problem.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.480
But that's my analysis.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.400
This is one of the areas where we get into this.

27:49.400 --> 27:53.400
I don't understand if there's like brain breaking happening or what's going on.

27:53.400 --> 27:57.320
I don't know what world we can ever live in where we say that Trump is less

27:57.320 --> 27:59.200
divisive for the country than Biden.

27:59.360 --> 28:03.320
I think it is so patently obvious Trump is so divisive, like not only

28:03.680 --> 28:06.920
does Trump make an enemy out of every person in the opposition party,

28:06.920 --> 28:10.280
he makes an enemy out of his own party and every single person around him.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.200
Like we all watched him bully, you know, Jeff Sessions.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.120
We all watched him bully his own party on Twitter.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.880
We all watched like all of these people walk away from him.

28:18.360 --> 28:22.400
Even recently, I think his secretary of defense, Esper

28:22.640 --> 28:25.600
and John Kelly, the chief of staff were, you know, saying,

28:25.600 --> 28:27.800
I think Trump is a threat to democracy.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.160
You know, you've got all of his prior people that were around him,

28:30.160 --> 28:31.160
some of his closest allies.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.360
You've got Bill Barr that won't co-sign a single thing that he says.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.160
You've got all these people that he used to work with that all say

28:38.160 --> 28:39.840
Trump is a horrible, evil person.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.840
He is ineffective as a leader.

28:40.840 --> 28:41.920
He doesn't accomplish anything.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.160
And he didn't, you know, to say that Biden has failed at bipartisanship

28:45.160 --> 28:48.080
when, you know, we've gotten the CHIPS Act, we've gotten the IRA,

28:48.080 --> 28:51.240
we've gotten the ARP, we've gotten the bipartisan infrastructure bill.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.480
When we've gotten like all this major legislation that is working

28:53.480 --> 28:56.920
in this historically divided Congress, as opposed to Trump

28:56.920 --> 28:59.080
that got us tax cuts and deficit spending.

29:00.080 --> 29:03.640
I don't understand where we ever are in this world where Biden is somehow

29:04.440 --> 29:05.920
more divisive than Trump.

29:05.920 --> 29:09.240
Even the speeches that Ben is bringing up, they always bring up.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.640
I remember that one.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.280
I think we might have even done it on our episode, though.

29:12.280 --> 29:15.600
The one speech that Biden gave at one point that like the background is red

29:15.920 --> 29:17.360
and the Philly speech I referenced.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.960
Yeah. And they're like, oh, my God, it's over.

29:18.960 --> 29:19.840
This is the end.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.600
And then meanwhile, you got Donald Trump, you know, coming into office

29:22.600 --> 29:25.600
saying things like, if you burn the flag, you should have your citizenship revoked

29:25.840 --> 29:29.360
or talking about MSDNC, that I'm going to investigate

29:29.480 --> 29:32.880
every single one of these media organizations for corruptness.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.640
I'm going to open the libel and defamation laws.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.640
I'm going to take all of these guys to court.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.960
You've got this weird Project 2025 stuff where

29:40.240 --> 29:44.000
it's a John Paschal, I think, is talking about, you know, we're going to

29:44.120 --> 29:45.880
we're going to investigate all of these people

29:45.880 --> 29:48.240
and we're going to try to throw crimes at all these people.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.480
Trump is like the most divisive president I think we've ever had

29:51.480 --> 29:54.640
in at least in my lifetime of being

29:55.320 --> 29:56.400
an American citizen.

29:56.400 --> 29:59.240
And the rhetoric from him is just it's on a whole other level

29:59.240 --> 30:01.720
in terms of the demonization of political opponents.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.560
I mean, this is a guy that's known for giving his political opponents

30:04.560 --> 30:06.200
bad nicknames, right?

30:06.200 --> 30:09.480
Like that's what Trump does, you know, like it's funny.

30:09.480 --> 30:13.800
But even as a resident of Florida, if Florida had another natural disaster,

30:14.000 --> 30:15.880
do you think Trump would withhold aid?

30:15.880 --> 30:18.600
Because you had I think that was one of the few nice things

30:18.600 --> 30:20.920
that DeSantis actually said about Biden was like, hey, listen,

30:21.080 --> 30:24.200
you know, when the buildings collapsed and I think that was Miami Beach.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.320
That, you know, for the hurricane stuff, that Biden was there.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.960
He was saying, if you guys need aid, however many billions, you can have it.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.080
Meanwhile, Trump, I think, was threatening to withhold federal funding

30:33.080 --> 30:35.160
from blue states that wouldn't.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.040
I think it had to do with the National Guard stuff,

30:37.040 --> 30:38.600
the deployment of the National Guard, that they weren't like

30:38.600 --> 30:39.760
doing enough for the riots.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.400
And Trump was threatening to withhold aid from some of these blue states.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.360
Yeah, Trump is literally the most divisive person in the world.

30:47.360 --> 30:51.720
I don't see how on any metric he is ever succeeding in the divisive category.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.080
In terms of the economy, I do think it's funny that Republicans

30:55.080 --> 30:57.920
are very keen to say that, like, well, we can't really grade Trump,

30:57.920 --> 31:01.040
you know, post-COVID, because obviously COVID mess everything up, which is fair.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.760
But pre-COVID, what did Trump do?

31:03.760 --> 31:05.800
Yeah, he did. He did deficit spending tax cuts.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.840
He presided over historic low interest rates and an economy that was already

31:08.840 --> 31:11.880
like like blazing past the final years of Obama.

31:11.880 --> 31:14.720
We were posting all time highs in all the stock markets in 2013 onwards.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.640
You know, unemployment rates were falling now under Biden.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.840
Unemployment rates are even lower than they were under Trump.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.240
But it sucks that for Trump, we can say,

31:22.240 --> 31:24.040
well, we can't really hold him accountable for 2020.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.000
That was COVID.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.240
Well, all we have for Biden is post-COVID.

31:27.240 --> 31:30.120
We don't have any pre-COVID Biden, you know, economy.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.800
And it was the same thing for Obama, too, coming in right

31:31.800 --> 31:33.320
after the housing collapse as well.

31:33.320 --> 31:36.680
And it sucks that Republicans are able to walk out of office,

31:36.680 --> 31:40.600
you know, having burned the entire American society to the ground economically.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.600
And now we've got to try to evaluate, OK, well, what did Obama do

31:43.600 --> 31:46.760
during his first two to three to four years just trying to recover

31:46.760 --> 31:48.880
from where the housing crash left it?

31:49.040 --> 31:52.120
And then we look at Biden now, who's trying to recover from COVID.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.320
And now we're grading him on on a totally different scale

31:54.320 --> 31:55.640
than what Trump is being graded on.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.240
Yeah, that that sucks, I think.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.440
We comment on the foreign policy on the foreign policy.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.520
I'm going to be honest, I am a I am very liberal and very not progressive.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.720
I'll probably come off as more hawkish than others

32:09.200 --> 32:12.760
because I'm not a big fan of this, which also if I mean, if Ben agrees,

32:12.760 --> 32:16.840
like I think people like people like Trump are going to be the most

32:16.840 --> 32:18.640
dovish isolationist people ever.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.040
They don't want to do anything internationally.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.000
They just want to, you know, protect America, be at home,

32:23.000 --> 32:25.400
protect our economy, don't do anything internationally,

32:25.400 --> 32:28.000
which is why he was constantly undermining NATO and constantly,

32:28.000 --> 32:31.520
you know, attacking the European Union and, you know, cheering on the UK

32:31.520 --> 32:33.880
for Brexit away from the EU.

32:33.880 --> 32:37.520
I think that being said, I think that Biden is done a phenomenal job

32:38.120 --> 32:39.320
when it comes to foreign policy.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.760
I think that the coalition building was so important for Ukraine, Russia.

32:43.760 --> 32:47.200
And I'm so happy that he decided to go to our European allies

32:47.200 --> 32:49.920
and our NATO allies and try to build a coalition of people to help Ukraine

32:50.120 --> 32:53.920
so that that wasn't only the United States personally,

32:53.920 --> 32:55.480
especially after doing a whole bunch of research.

32:55.480 --> 32:58.720
I do tend to side with Israel over Palestine

32:58.720 --> 33:00.720
and a lot of the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.960
I'm glad that Biden, while remaining a staunch defender of Israel,

33:03.960 --> 33:07.080
is trying to rein in some of the more aggressive posturing

33:07.080 --> 33:09.360
towards the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

33:09.360 --> 33:12.160
I'm proud that Biden said, hey, listen, we're going to delay

33:12.160 --> 33:15.440
some of these attacks. Hey, listen, we are going to allow humanitarian aid here.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.680
Hey, listen, we are going to try to, you know, not kill as many

33:18.680 --> 33:21.680
Palestinian people down there while still signaling that he would be

33:21.680 --> 33:25.800
a staunch supporter of of Israel in the conflict,

33:25.800 --> 33:30.040
assuming the civilian casualties don't go too high for foreign policy.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.840
I mean, blemishes.

33:31.840 --> 33:36.560
I mean, the biggest one you can give to Biden is Afghanistan in the poll out there.

33:36.760 --> 33:40.800
But man, are we going to talk about, you know, the inspector general report

33:40.800 --> 33:42.840
that says that one of the biggest reasons why the Afghanistan

33:42.840 --> 33:45.360
plot was so disastrous was because of the Doha Accords,

33:45.600 --> 33:49.480
where Donald Trump headed talks that didn't even include the Afghanistan army.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.280
I mean, like these were disasters.

33:51.280 --> 33:55.400
Like when when Biden took office, we had twenty five hundred troops left in Afghanistan.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.240
Like, what was the options even afforded to Biden at that point?

33:59.240 --> 34:01.520
Obviously, you've got the abandonment of the Kurds in northern Syria,

34:01.520 --> 34:04.280
too, you know, for the Turkish armies to lay waste to.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.480
You talk about Iran and North Korea, although I'm not sure where

34:08.560 --> 34:10.640
that would land on those. But yeah, that's a broadly.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.400
That's a lot from both of you.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.840
You want to pick pick at something where you disagree with here?

34:14.840 --> 34:16.040
Well, I mean, there's a lot.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.560
So, I mean, it's I want to ask a few questions on each one of these.

34:20.040 --> 34:23.440
So let's let's talk about divisiveness for a second.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.600
So there's no one who can make the case that Donald Trump is not divisive.

34:26.640 --> 34:29.600
Yeah, of course. He's incredibly divisive.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.200
It's a given.

34:30.200 --> 34:34.600
Well, do you treat Biden's rhetoric with the same level of seriousness

34:34.600 --> 34:37.200
that you treat Trump's rhetoric or I should put that the other way around.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.320
Should we treat Trump's rhetoric with the same level of seriousness

34:40.320 --> 34:42.560
as Joe Biden or say Barack Obama's rhetoric?

34:43.520 --> 34:44.960
I'm going to try to be concise.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.680
Broadly speaking, especially in studying Israel, Palestine and you could rush up.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.120
I try not to take politicians at their word because sometimes

34:51.120 --> 34:52.360
they just say stuff to say stuff.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.400
I understand that.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.120
But broadly speaking, I'm going to look at the rhetoric and the actions

34:56.120 --> 34:57.680
and I am going to grade them the same.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.160
So, yes, I would hold Biden and Trump to the same.

35:00.200 --> 35:04.120
Right. So my feeling is in this one area where for clarification,

35:04.120 --> 35:07.680
we're going to have a division is that I, of course, don't treat Trump's rhetoric

35:07.680 --> 35:09.640
in the same way that I treat Biden's or Obama's.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.680
He's utterly uncalibrated and he says whatever he wants to at any given time.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.800
And it doesn't even match up with his policy very often.

35:14.800 --> 35:18.520
Can I ask you, like for our head of state, our chief executive,

35:18.800 --> 35:22.320
shouldn't rhetoric be arguably one of the most important things that he does?

35:22.400 --> 35:24.200
I mean, the answer would be yes.

35:24.200 --> 35:28.000
And now I've been given a choice between a person who I think in calibrated ways

35:28.000 --> 35:30.920
says things that are divisive and a person who in uncalibrated ways

35:31.280 --> 35:33.200
says things that are divisive.

35:33.200 --> 35:37.080
And so the evidence that Joe Biden is divisive is every poll taken

35:37.520 --> 35:40.320
since essentially August of 2021.

35:40.560 --> 35:45.000
He he is, by all available metrics, incredibly divisive.

35:45.200 --> 35:49.440
A huge percentage of Americans are deeply unhappy, not only with his performance,

35:49.440 --> 35:50.920
but don't believe he's a uniter.

35:50.920 --> 35:52.520
They're that's just the reality.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.600
And that may just be a reflection.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.040
I mean, honestly, we may be putting too much on Trump or Biden personally.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.880
It may just be that the American people themselves are rhetorically divided

35:58.880 --> 36:02.400
because of social media and social media can, in fact, be assessable.

36:02.680 --> 36:06.160
And one thing that I would ask you about that, though, is I agree,

36:06.160 --> 36:07.600
especially when you look at the favorability.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.960
But sometimes when I look at these polls, when you start to disaggregate them

36:10.960 --> 36:16.000
by party, I wonder if it's actually is Biden historically divisive or

36:16.560 --> 36:18.280
I'm trying to think of a really polite way to say this.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.680
The people that like Trump worship Trump.

36:20.760 --> 36:21.400
I don't know.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.200
I like one of the most prescient things that Trump could have probably ever said

36:24.200 --> 36:26.920
was that I could kill someone on Fifth Street and nobody would make animal.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.840
So is it really that Biden is strictly divisive or is it that every single

36:29.840 --> 36:31.760
Trump supporter will always say that Trump is great?

36:31.760 --> 36:35.200
And the reason I would say that Biden is, in fact, historically divisive

36:35.200 --> 36:38.320
is because Republicans felt much more strongly about Barack Obama

36:38.840 --> 36:40.480
than Joe Biden, actually.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.840
But they didn't feel as strongly about Trump as they did about like Romney

36:42.840 --> 36:44.720
or McCain, right? In what way?

36:44.720 --> 36:46.840
I mean, the allegiance to Trump.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.280
Oh, no, there's certainly more allegiance to Trump than it is to Romney or McCain,

36:49.280 --> 36:51.000
largely because Trump won in 2016.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.120
But beyond that, the the point that I'm making is that if you're looking

36:55.120 --> 36:58.560
at the stats in terms of divisiveness, Republicans always find

36:58.560 --> 36:59.680
the Democratic president divisive.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.600
The question is where the rest of the country is.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.680
And right now, there are a lot of Democrats who either don't agree

37:04.680 --> 37:06.440
with Biden or, you know, find divisive.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.160
There are a lot of independents who find him divisive.

37:08.160 --> 37:11.080
So when you're when we're comparing these things, I don't think they're leagues

37:11.080 --> 37:13.640
apart in terms of the divisive effect of what they say.

37:14.160 --> 37:17.240
Right. And I'm separating that off from like the inherent content of what they say.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.280
Obviously, what Trump says is more divisive just on like the raw level.

37:20.280 --> 37:23.840
I mean, if he's insulting people as opposed to Joe Biden doing MAGA Republicans,

37:24.080 --> 37:26.560
like if I were to just if I were an alien come down from space

37:26.560 --> 37:29.000
and look at these two statements, I'd say this one's more divisive than this one.

37:29.280 --> 37:31.920
But then there's the reality of being a human being in the world.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.320
And that is everyone has baked Donald Trump into the cake.

37:34.600 --> 37:40.120
And Joe Biden, again, started off with a patina of being non divisive

37:40.120 --> 37:41.800
and now has emerged as divisive.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.160
If you don't mind, I actually want to get to the foreign policy questions,

37:44.160 --> 37:45.720
because this one is actually slightly less interesting to me.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.160
Sure. Well, can I just one quick thing, I guess, like because we can say

37:49.160 --> 37:51.280
the reality of it and we can look at opinion polls.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.520
What if we look like legislative accomplishments like Biden is working

37:54.520 --> 37:56.240
on a 50, 50 divided Senate.

37:56.240 --> 37:59.520
Donald Trump had both House of Congress and the Supreme Court

37:59.720 --> 38:01.880
and got like no major legislation passed.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.240
Well, I mean, he did lose Congress in 2018.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.640
But sure. But prior to that, we got the we got the infrastructure bill,

38:08.640 --> 38:11.320
I think, in one year, which Trump promised for his entire presidency.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.320
He didn't get anywhere.

38:12.320 --> 38:15.360
I mean, yes, his Republican base was not in favor of mass spending

38:15.360 --> 38:17.000
on infrastructure and neither am I.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.960
So there's that. I think that's mostly a state and local.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.920
They were in favor of mass spending for tax cuts.

38:20.960 --> 38:21.800
That's not a spending.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.080
I mean, I mean, effectively, it is right.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.440
Effectively, it's not.

38:25.440 --> 38:28.760
Well, if you're cutting tax receipts, but you're not changing the level of spending

38:28.760 --> 38:30.600
like Biden did with the IRA.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.040
Again, we have we have a fundamental philosophical difference here.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.560
I think that when when the government takes my money, that is not

38:35.760 --> 38:39.560
that is not the government somehow being more fiscally responsible.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.280
And when the government allows me to keep my money,

38:41.280 --> 38:42.600
I don't see that as the government spending.

38:42.600 --> 38:45.080
I see that as my money and the government is taking less of it.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.960
That's great. But at the end of the day, the government is still going to be

38:46.960 --> 38:49.080
in a deficit spending and they're going to have to borrow money from the Treasury.

38:49.080 --> 38:49.960
Right. We have a spending problem.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.080
In other words, not a receipts problem is the case that I'm making.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.280
The problem with with Donald Trump is not that he lowered taxes.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.680
The United States has one of the most progressive tax systems on the planet.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.760
And in fact, if you wish to have a European style social welfare state,

38:59.760 --> 39:01.840
what you actually need is to tax the middle class to death.

39:02.160 --> 39:05.440
I mean, the reality is the top 20 percent of the American population

39:05.440 --> 39:08.680
pays literally all net taxes in the United States after after state

39:08.680 --> 39:09.800
benefits and all of us. Sure.

39:09.800 --> 39:13.000
So if you actually wanted to have the kind of social welfare state

39:13.000 --> 39:15.680
that many liberals seem to want to have, like Northern Europe, for example,

39:16.080 --> 39:18.920
you'd actually have to tax people who make 40, 50, 60 thousand dollars.

39:18.920 --> 39:20.080
And I don't want that. I agree with that.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.200
So how do you explain the lack of legislation?

39:22.200 --> 39:23.920
I mean, if he's like such a uniter.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.320
Because I think the Republican Party itself is quite divided.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.000
And I think that Trump's. But isn't that his job?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.040
He's the head of the Republican Party is the president,

39:30.040 --> 39:31.520
Republican president of the United States.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.680
I mean, again, I don't think that Joe Biden has passed

39:33.680 --> 39:35.920
wildly historic legislation.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.760
The infrastructure was the largest, like.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.960
So here's the problem. If you're a Republican,

39:39.960 --> 39:43.200
the only bills that you can get consensus on tend to be bills

39:43.200 --> 39:47.400
that either that that let's be real about this, that are tax cuts,

39:47.600 --> 39:51.640
because as you would, I think, agree with

39:52.160 --> 39:54.080
when it comes to polling data, Americans constantly say

39:54.080 --> 39:54.880
they want to cut the government.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.000
And then the minute you ask them which program, they have no idea

39:57.400 --> 39:58.040
what they're right. Exactly.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.520
And so trying to it's much harder to come up with a bill

40:00.680 --> 40:03.680
to cut things than it is to come up with a bill to add things,

40:03.680 --> 40:06.920
coming up, which is why spending was out of control under under Trump as well.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.000
But there are some Republicans who still don't want to spend on those things.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.840
Right. So inherently, the task that this goes back to the first question,

40:12.840 --> 40:15.520
the task that Republicans think government is there to do

40:15.520 --> 40:18.720
is different than the task that Democrats think that government is there to do.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.880
So the way that the very metric of success for a Democratic president

40:21.880 --> 40:25.120
versus a Republican president, namely, for example, pieces of legislation

40:25.160 --> 40:28.400
passed as a Republican, one of my goals is to pass nearly no legislation

40:28.400 --> 40:32.400
because I don't actually want the government involved in more areas of our life.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.520
I want to ask a couple of questions on the foreign policy.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.040
Sure. Yeah. OK, wait, real quick.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.600
So for instance, like Donald Trump wanted to punish China

40:38.600 --> 40:41.680
and he wanted to bring microprocessor manufacturing to the United States.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.160
Biden did that with legislation, with the Chips Act.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.160
You talk about like spending being out of control.

40:46.160 --> 40:47.560
And I mean, I can agree with that.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.280
I think anybody that looks at the numbers has to agree with that.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.800
But why not pass legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act,

40:52.320 --> 40:54.440
which is at least like spending neutral, right?

40:54.440 --> 40:56.320
Like, why are there not bills where Donald Trump could take?

40:56.320 --> 40:57.880
Well, I mean, first of all, I think that whenever the government

40:57.880 --> 41:00.360
says something is spending neutral, it rarely materializes that way.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.760
That is not going to be a spending neutral bill.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.960
Sure. But there's a difference between like at least they say

41:03.960 --> 41:06.480
it's spending neutral versus this is a five hundred billion dollar bill

41:06.480 --> 41:07.800
over like 10 years.

41:07.800 --> 41:11.320
Well, but again, I don't see a tax cut as a matter of spending neutrality.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.760
The big problem is they keep spending, not that they are allowing me

41:13.760 --> 41:15.560
to keep the money that I earned and they did not earn.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.840
But OK, so then just to understand.

41:16.840 --> 41:20.360
So if somebody just did massive like reductions in tax receipts,

41:20.360 --> 41:23.360
so tax cut after tax cut after tax cut, but they didn't change spending at all.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.080
You wouldn't consider that like an increase in deficit spending

41:26.080 --> 41:27.080
or out of control spending.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.880
You would just say they're just tax cuts.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.680
No, the opposite. I would consider it a wild.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.960
I would consider it a wild overspending.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.720
OK. Meaning then was it under Trump then when he did the tax spending,

41:36.720 --> 41:38.880
by the way, under under Biden is way worse than it was.

41:38.880 --> 41:41.440
Of course. But we're in post covid, right?

41:41.440 --> 41:42.640
Covid ended effectively.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.240
I mean, you live in Florida. Covid effectively ended

41:44.240 --> 41:46.240
in the state of Florida by the middle of 2021.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.600
Yeah. I mean, even if you're a vaccine fan, by like April, May of 2021,

41:49.600 --> 41:52.960
there was wide availability of vaccines, whether or not you like the vaccines.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.040
Yeah. And at that point, we were done.

41:55.040 --> 41:58.760
I agree. But like we're in a post, like how many trillions of dollars

41:58.760 --> 42:01.640
have been dumped in worldwide that are like leading to inflation, right?

42:01.640 --> 42:03.960
The inflation is like a worldwide issue right now

42:03.960 --> 42:05.680
because of the economy shutting down for a year or two.

42:05.680 --> 42:08.000
It's not like those effects are gone in one year, right?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.320
Covid might be gone, but the after effects of all the stimulus

42:10.320 --> 42:11.360
spending and the unemployment and everything else.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.960
The definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.480
So pouring more money on top of that makes for more inflation.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.640
That's what it does. Sure. I agree.

42:19.080 --> 42:21.720
But like there's also the definition of when do you deficit spend

42:21.720 --> 42:23.320
is when economies are headed for recessions, right?

42:23.320 --> 42:25.400
Rather than when economies are doing really well, like they were under Trump

42:25.400 --> 42:26.520
and he was deficit spending.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.400
Whereas Biden can at least make the argument that I should.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.200
I ought to be deficit spending because the economy is headed

42:30.200 --> 42:31.960
for potential. So here's the thing.

42:31.960 --> 42:34.240
I don't think that the economy is actually headed for recession.

42:34.600 --> 42:38.520
In fact, if you look at the economic statistics, it was no.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.920
OK, they're still saying that there's like a recession coming, right?

42:40.920 --> 42:43.440
But that was largely because of the after effects of inflation, meaning

42:43.440 --> 42:46.640
if you inflate the economy, what you're going to end up doing is bursting a bubble.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.440
And then when that bubble bursts, you'll get a recession.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.640
I mean, that was the basic idea, right?

42:50.040 --> 42:51.960
The question was whether you're going to get a soft landing.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.720
But if you actually look at, for example, the employment statistics

42:54.720 --> 42:57.080
or the economic growth statistics in the United States, what they look like

42:57.320 --> 42:59.120
under the last years, Obama and then Trump.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.160
I mean, this is what the chart looks like.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.800
It looks like this. And then it hits March of 2020.

43:02.800 --> 43:03.960
It goes like that. Yeah.

43:03.960 --> 43:06.320
And then by like September, it bounces back up, right?

43:06.320 --> 43:07.320
It's a V shaped recovery.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.120
And then it starts to peter out. Sure.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.040
And because of the American recovery plan, right, that Biden did as well.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.840
I mean, four million jobs.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.400
No, I'm not going to attribute it to that because the rates of growth

43:17.400 --> 43:21.000
in job growth from September, October, November were actually very similar

43:21.000 --> 43:24.120
to the rates of job growth after Joe Biden took office.

43:24.360 --> 43:25.920
What you see is actually kind of a straight line.

43:25.920 --> 43:28.160
I mean, what the chart looks like in any case.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.720
OK, so on the foreign policy stuff, this is getting abstruse,

43:30.720 --> 43:32.840
but on the foreign policy stuff.

43:33.480 --> 43:38.400
So the the questions that I have with regard to to Biden on foreign policy.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.880
Very, very simple question.

43:42.160 --> 43:45.440
Do you think that the situation in the Middle East is better now

43:45.440 --> 43:46.880
than it was under Donald Trump?

43:48.160 --> 43:49.160
Hmm.

43:50.800 --> 43:54.720
Probably, that's a hard one.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.160
The factors that I'm making right now are like, obviously,

43:59.160 --> 44:01.680
you've got the Israel-Palestinian war that's going on right now,

44:01.680 --> 44:04.600
which is kind of bad, but like broadly speaking, I'm not sure how much

44:04.600 --> 44:07.040
that affects the Middle East as much as like the collapse of Syria.

44:07.280 --> 44:10.880
Twenty thirteen Syrian civil war sent millions of immigrants

44:10.880 --> 44:14.440
throughout all of Europe, which was under which was under Obama

44:14.440 --> 44:15.480
and continued under Trump.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.120
Trump didn't do anything to alleviate any of the Syrian civil war.

44:19.640 --> 44:22.320
And why did Syria end up as a preserve of Russia again?

44:22.640 --> 44:24.440
How did Syria end up as a preserve of Russia?

44:24.440 --> 44:26.920
Yes. Why did it end up being essentially a client state of Russia?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.720
I know that Putin enjoys access to the ports down there.

44:31.400 --> 44:32.160
I don't know.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.080
I mean, the reason is because Barack Obama suggested

44:34.080 --> 44:36.640
there was a red line that would be drawn in the face of chemical weapons

44:36.640 --> 44:39.240
use, but rather than use chemical weapons in Syria.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.800
And Barack Obama was unwilling to then.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.920
Essentially create consequences for Syria

44:44.920 --> 44:46.480
in the form of any sort of Western strike.

44:46.480 --> 44:47.920
And so instead, he outsourced it to Russia.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.840
This is 2013, 2014. Sure.

44:49.840 --> 44:51.640
Do you think there might have been some hesitancy after, like,

44:51.640 --> 44:54.560
seeing how Libya ended up that maybe us like intervening.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.480
Who was president during Libya?

44:56.480 --> 44:59.200
Yeah, I mean, what does that have to do with anything, though?

44:59.200 --> 45:00.920
I mean, there might have been like a mistake learned.

45:00.920 --> 45:02.640
The point that I'm making is that actually the Middle East,

45:02.640 --> 45:05.800
I mean, just historically speaking, was historically good under Donald Trump.

45:05.960 --> 45:08.360
I mean, it's very difficult to make the case that either before

45:08.360 --> 45:10.480
or after Trump were better than during Donald Trump.

45:10.800 --> 45:14.160
I mean, the Syrian, I don't think that Trump contributed

45:14.160 --> 45:16.560
to the Syrian situation and improving much.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.440
I mean, he did wreck ISIS, which was in the.

45:19.440 --> 45:22.200
I mean, ISIS had been getting wrecked by the Kurds in Iraq,

45:22.200 --> 45:26.080
by every single person, by Assad's army, by Putin, by Turkey.

45:26.080 --> 45:28.240
Literally everybody was fighting against ISIS at that point.

45:28.960 --> 45:29.840
There's a spike in violence.

45:29.840 --> 45:30.800
And then the Trump.

45:30.800 --> 45:33.960
I mean, you get credit for when you're president, presumably.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.360
I mean, things got better with ISIS under Trump.

45:36.800 --> 45:37.680
I mean, yeah, they did.

45:37.680 --> 45:40.240
I mean, things got worse with ISIS under Obama.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.240
For sure. He called them the JV squad.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.800
And then they became not the JV squad.

45:43.800 --> 45:48.560
Yeah. But I don't know if ISIS is originating in Syria and Baghdad

45:48.560 --> 45:51.160
and all of the growth of that is necessarily Obama's fault.

45:51.200 --> 45:53.560
I know that we like to say that Obama created ISIS.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.400
I don't know if you say that, but I've heard that saying a lot.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.560
I think that's a little bit simplistic.

45:57.560 --> 46:00.560
I don't think that when I'm looking at like actions that presidents have taken,

46:00.560 --> 46:03.880
the biggest the biggest criticism I have for like Middle Eastern policy

46:03.880 --> 46:05.800
is I think the Doha Accords were a disaster.

46:05.800 --> 46:08.240
And I think that's like one of the biggest blemishes that we have right now.

46:08.400 --> 46:12.360
I would also argue that moving the embassy to Jerusalem was also kind of silly

46:12.840 --> 46:15.560
and arguably contributed to some of the conflict we see right now.

46:15.560 --> 46:18.800
No, I'll argue precisely the opposite, especially given the fact that

46:18.800 --> 46:21.560
after the movement of the embassy to Jerusalem, the Abraham Accords

46:21.560 --> 46:23.440
continued to sign and actually expand.

46:23.440 --> 46:26.880
And that if Donald Trump had been elected, I have no doubt in my mind

46:26.880 --> 46:29.440
that Saudi Arabia would now be a part of the Abraham Accords.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.640
In fact, that was basically pre-negotiated.

46:31.640 --> 46:34.880
And then when Joe Biden took office, Joe Biden took a very anti-Saudi

46:34.880 --> 46:37.080
stance on a wide variety of issues.

46:37.080 --> 46:40.160
The biggest single effect in the Middle East of Joe Biden's presidency.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.760
And again, I agree with you that not every foreign policy issue

46:42.760 --> 46:44.800
can be laid at the hands of a president.

46:44.800 --> 46:48.320
Joe Biden's main approach to the Middle East was very similar to the Obama approach,

46:48.320 --> 46:50.840
which is why the Middle East was chaotic under Obama and chaotic under Biden.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.440
And that was to alienate allies like Saudi Arabia and Israel

46:55.680 --> 47:00.560
and instead to try to make common cause or cut deals with Iran.

47:00.760 --> 47:02.840
What that did is incentivize terrorism from Iran.

47:02.840 --> 47:05.760
What we're watching in the Middle East is Iran attempting to use every one

47:05.760 --> 47:07.320
of its terror proxies in the Middle East.

47:07.320 --> 47:10.800
And it was specifically launched in an attempt to avoid what Biden

47:10.800 --> 47:13.960
actually was trying to do, which was good, which was after two years

47:13.960 --> 47:16.200
of failure with Saudi Arabia, tried to bring them into the Abraham Accords.

47:16.200 --> 47:18.920
Right. That was what was burgeoning at the end of at the end of last year.

47:19.120 --> 47:22.600
And Iran saw that and Iran decided that they were going to throw a grenade

47:22.600 --> 47:25.520
into the middle of those negotiations by essentially activating Hamas.

47:25.680 --> 47:27.680
Hamas activates, Hamas commits October 7th.

47:27.680 --> 47:30.360
Israel, as a sovereign nation state, has to respond to the murder

47:30.360 --> 47:33.360
of 1200 of its citizens and the taken kidnapping of 240.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.360
Israel has to do that not only to go after its own hostages

47:36.360 --> 47:39.120
and try to restore them, but also to reestablish military deterrence

47:39.120 --> 47:40.840
in the most violent region of the world.

47:40.840 --> 47:43.280
He's Bala gets active on Israel's northern border.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.160
He's Bala is an Iranian proxy.

47:45.160 --> 47:47.320
They get active on the northern border.

47:47.320 --> 47:49.720
The who these in Yemen get active.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.880
These are all the only reason all this is happening at the same time

47:51.880 --> 47:53.400
is because Iran is doing this. Right.

47:53.400 --> 47:56.040
But not just that, they are threatening global shipping.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.880
Sure. You're talking about the effects of global supply lines,

47:57.880 --> 48:01.040
which I totally agree had a major inflationary effect on the economy.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.240
Thanks to Covid.

48:02.240 --> 48:05.480
Right now, the cost of shipping is nearly double

48:05.600 --> 48:07.240
what it was just a few weeks ago.

48:07.240 --> 48:11.160
And that is because a ragtag group of who the barbarians are attacking

48:11.160 --> 48:13.720
international shipping and forcing everybody to stop using the Babel

48:13.720 --> 48:17.360
Mandem straight instead going around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.920
All of that is the result of the fact that Joe Biden reoriented

48:20.920 --> 48:24.720
the United States in the very early days in favor of a more pro-Iranian stance.

48:24.720 --> 48:27.560
He appointed Robert Mallet to negotiate the Iran deal, who, as it turns out,

48:27.560 --> 48:29.160
was using proxies.

48:29.160 --> 48:31.040
Many of his aides were actually taking money from Iran.

48:31.760 --> 48:33.320
The the the Biden administration,

48:33.320 --> 48:35.960
literally one of their first act was to delist the Houthis

48:35.960 --> 48:38.920
as a terror organization and sanctions against the Houthis.

48:39.560 --> 48:41.840
These are all moves that Biden made very early on.

48:41.840 --> 48:42.680
They were disastrous moves.

48:42.680 --> 48:45.440
But when it comes to domestic policy, I think he hasn't been nearly as

48:45.440 --> 48:47.160
damn domestic. Hold on. Let's go on a foreign.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.880
Sure. Sure. So just on a couple of Middle Eastern things.

48:48.880 --> 48:51.640
So one of the big things that threw the Middle East into disaster was

48:52.000 --> 48:55.440
what we all traumatized by it now was the Iraq invasion.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.680
I'm a Republican president. Sure. You agree with that, right?

48:57.680 --> 49:01.640
Sure. The deposition of Saddam Hussein and everything that followed after

49:01.800 --> 49:04.520
probably contributed more to the growth of ISIS and the destabilization

49:04.640 --> 49:06.560
of that entire region, probably more than anything else.

49:06.560 --> 49:10.040
I think that under prior to Bush, for Clinton, even at the beginning

49:10.040 --> 49:12.960
of Bush's presidency, we were on some kind of road to normalcy

49:13.360 --> 49:16.320
with Iran, which I think has to happen, whether we like them or not,

49:16.920 --> 49:20.600
until Bush, for whatever reason, decides to throw Iran into the axis of evil.

49:20.680 --> 49:23.400
And it means that we're on a road to normalcy with Iran in the 1990s.

49:23.560 --> 49:27.600
We do in the way that we are on a road to normalcy with Iran in the 1990s.

49:27.600 --> 49:31.480
My understanding is that, yeah, from the late 90s and prior to the axis of evil,

49:31.800 --> 49:34.680
labeling of Iran, that there was going to be some path forward

49:34.680 --> 49:36.680
to where we could start to normalize relationships with them.

49:36.680 --> 49:39.880
I find that very difficult to believe, and I don't see a lot of evidence.

49:39.880 --> 49:40.960
I mean, we can just disagree on that.

49:40.960 --> 49:42.200
OK, yeah, sure. We can disagree on that.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.920
But I know that the after effects, just a quick note,

49:45.040 --> 49:47.040
the after effect of the Iraq war that was the most devastating

49:47.040 --> 49:48.720
was the increase in power of Iran.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.400
I agree. Yeah, because of the destabilization in Iraq and Iraq

49:51.400 --> 49:55.720
not having a government there that was functional for at least a decade.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.040
And was, in fact, a Sunni government, right?

49:57.040 --> 49:58.520
Originally, it was a Sunni government.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.560
Disbanding the Sunni army was one of the worst things

50:00.560 --> 50:02.720
that the Bush administration did banning all the former Ba'ath parties.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.120
sectarian. Yeah, all horrible under Republican president.

50:05.840 --> 50:09.680
But disagree that the yeah, that that probably contributed more to ISIS,

50:09.960 --> 50:13.240
to the growth of power in Iran, maybe even to the destabilization of Syria,

50:13.320 --> 50:15.920
probably more than anything that Obama did.

50:15.920 --> 50:19.480
Also, the when we look at Iran funding people in the region,

50:19.480 --> 50:20.640
I don't disagree with that as well.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.640
I think Iran is the number one instigator of bad guy

50:22.640 --> 50:25.200
things right now in the Middle East. Iran, the IRGC.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.000
I supported when Donald Trump killed Soleimani.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.560
I think that was a great thing.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.520
I think that Iran is a major problem.

50:30.520 --> 50:35.480
However, I don't know if the path forward is constantly being a belligerent

50:35.480 --> 50:38.080
to Iran or trying to figure out some road to normalcy.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.560
I don't know if the collapse of Iran or the destruction of that country,

50:41.560 --> 50:45.640
considering how unpopular the idol even is there like the citizens of Iran.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.880
I don't think our big supporters of the government there.

50:47.880 --> 50:51.200
I feel like moving on a path where, you know, let's do our nuclear inspections.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.960
We had that Iranian nuclear deal that Trump pulled out of.

50:54.080 --> 50:55.280
Let's do the nuclear inspections.

50:55.280 --> 50:56.720
Make sure you're not on the way to nuclear weapons.

50:56.720 --> 50:57.800
Let's unfree some funds.

50:57.840 --> 51:00.640
Let's move in some direction where we get on a good term with you.

51:00.640 --> 51:03.840
I feel like that's the most important thing that needs to happen in the Middle East.

51:03.840 --> 51:07.400
As much as people like to look at the Abraham Accords, who cares if what was it?

51:07.400 --> 51:11.840
Bahrain, I think Oman, I think the UAE and Morocco.

51:11.840 --> 51:15.600
Yeah, like all of these people, even Saudi Arabia, already have like de facto

51:15.600 --> 51:17.480
normalization with Israel anyway. They're all trading.

51:17.480 --> 51:22.360
No, I mean, to pretend that anybody even 15 years ago would have been talking

51:22.360 --> 51:25.280
about normalization, Saudi Arabia and Israel is insane.

51:25.280 --> 51:27.640
They were already on that path.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.040
They had already been trading.

51:29.040 --> 51:32.840
They were already de facto trading partners with each other that they had already

51:32.840 --> 51:33.680
been collaborating.

51:33.680 --> 51:38.080
It's a wild claim that Israel and Saudi Arabia were going to normalize 15 years ago.

51:38.080 --> 51:42.520
15 years ago might have been a wild claim, but after Turkey, after Jordan,

51:42.520 --> 51:46.040
and then in the past like 20 years of like economic relations and ties with each other,

51:46.040 --> 51:49.360
all of the leadership in the Middle East, and you'll agree with this, look at Israel

51:49.360 --> 51:54.200
and they go, OK, well, we've got Palestinians who, you know, God bless them, do nothing.

51:54.440 --> 51:58.280
And then you've got Israel, which is on a on a region with no natural resources

51:58.280 --> 51:59.680
to somehow become like an economic giant.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.680
They're good to trade with their populations, educated.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.640
They, you know, have military power.

52:03.640 --> 52:06.320
All of the leadership in these Middle Eastern countries are wanting to be

52:06.320 --> 52:09.120
friendly with Israel and are engaging in trade de facto with Israel.

52:09.200 --> 52:12.960
And the idea that like the UAE and Bahrain were brought in to say like,

52:12.960 --> 52:14.560
oh, well, now we're going to officially say this.

52:14.560 --> 52:18.880
I just those were the first steps toward, obviously, the formation of a new Middle

52:18.880 --> 52:22.880
East in which economics would predominate over sectarian conflict.

52:22.960 --> 52:24.720
The chief obstacle to that is Iran.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.760
I agree the notion that that negotiations with the Ayatollah

52:27.760 --> 52:30.320
were going to be a solution to any of this is.

52:30.320 --> 52:33.480
But do we think absolutely benign are the is it the Abraham Accords

52:33.480 --> 52:36.160
that's convincing Saudi Arabia to take a stance against Iran?

52:37.040 --> 52:39.800
No, I mean, there are already fighting with each other, right?

52:40.080 --> 52:43.600
I don't think the Abraham Accords moved us any closer towards any type of real

52:43.600 --> 52:46.520
peace in the region, but what has to happen is something has to happen with Iran.

52:46.640 --> 52:49.160
There has to be some diplomatic bilateral communication there.

52:49.600 --> 52:52.160
No, what has to happen is the containment of Iran, which was what was in.

52:52.600 --> 52:55.680
Which was what was taking place with the increased normalization

52:55.680 --> 53:00.000
with the Sunni Arab world and Israel combined with significant economic sanctions.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.520
The notion that that there's this far fetched notion in foreign policy circles

53:05.520 --> 53:08.920
that diplomacy can sort of be wish cast out of thin air, that if you sit around a table

53:08.920 --> 53:10.800
that you can always come to an agreement with somebody.

53:10.800 --> 53:13.520
The Ayatollahs do not have common interests with the United States.

53:13.800 --> 53:17.680
They do not. And this idea that they are willing to take money in exchange for,

53:17.680 --> 53:21.640
for example, some sort of people, peaceful acquiescence to Israel's existence

53:21.640 --> 53:22.840
is obviously untrue.

53:22.840 --> 53:27.400
Hasn't that been the case, though, that you've had a region with tons

53:27.400 --> 53:28.720
of sectarian violence for a long time.

53:28.720 --> 53:31.760
And then finally, Turkey was like, you know what, this isn't worth it.

53:31.920 --> 53:33.320
The United States paid them a lot of money.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.200
They had conversations with Israel.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.480
You know what? The economy, the economic gain.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.360
Well, I mean, that's the same thing with Jordan.

53:39.360 --> 53:41.680
Same thing with the Turkish politics, but the

53:42.520 --> 53:45.720
but the situation in Turkey was actually quite warm between Israel and Turkey

53:45.720 --> 53:49.200
in the 90s when you had the the sort of

53:50.080 --> 53:52.800
secular Muslim regime in the 90s.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.440
But they signed an audit in place.

53:54.440 --> 53:59.440
And now Erdogan has joined in the fray and Erdogan is significantly more radical.

53:59.440 --> 54:02.600
Sure. I'm so sorry if I said to her again in Egypt.

54:02.600 --> 54:04.480
My bad. Yeah, right.

54:04.480 --> 54:07.000
So yeah, so in terms of like Egypt and Jordan, right.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.720
Were the first two you need.

54:08.720 --> 54:10.360
So here's the thing you need.

54:10.360 --> 54:12.840
Is it possible that you could theoretically come to a deal with Iran

54:12.840 --> 54:14.600
only with a new leadership group?

54:14.600 --> 54:17.080
OK, this is true for every peace agreement in the region.

54:17.080 --> 54:17.960
You could not.

54:17.960 --> 54:20.160
Israel could not have made peace with.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.240
Well, they made peace with Egypt.

54:21.240 --> 54:23.680
And Sadat was the leader for Yom Kippur, right?

54:23.680 --> 54:25.640
Did not make peace with Nasser, right?

54:25.640 --> 54:27.120
The point is that this is a different regime.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.320
You need a different regime.

54:28.320 --> 54:31.280
But I think the same regime that did the part of the Yom Kippur War

54:31.280 --> 54:33.640
was the same regime that negotiated peace with Israel.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.360
I mean, that's true.

54:35.360 --> 54:39.920
It is also true that that is a relationship that could be cultivated

54:39.920 --> 54:44.120
specifically because it was Sadat who made clear he was going to come to the table.

54:44.720 --> 54:46.840
Have the Iranians ever made clear that they would come to the table over,

54:46.840 --> 54:48.800
for example, the existence of the state of Israel?

54:48.800 --> 54:51.200
No, that is not a thing that's going to happen.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.440
But I think people probably felt the same.

54:53.440 --> 54:56.160
Every single one of the proxy, every one of them not only calls

54:56.160 --> 54:57.760
for the destruction of the state of Israel,

54:57.760 --> 54:59.920
they also call for the destruction of America.

54:59.920 --> 55:01.680
I mean, this is literally the Houthi slogan.

55:01.680 --> 55:02.640
They're busy hitting ships.

55:02.640 --> 55:05.920
And their slogan is literally Al Huakbar, death to America,

55:05.920 --> 55:07.600
death to the Jews, death to Israel.

55:07.600 --> 55:10.120
It doesn't fit on a bumper sticker, but it's not all that catchy.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.760
But that is, in fact, their slogan.

55:11.760 --> 55:15.360
The notion that the regime that propagates that is going to be

55:15.400 --> 55:18.240
approach with diplomacy is not only wrong.

55:18.400 --> 55:22.560
The problem is that it's easy to say the stakes of diplomacy are OK.

55:22.680 --> 55:23.640
So we try to talk, right?

55:23.640 --> 55:25.720
Jaw jaw is better than war war.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.480
Sure. The only problem is that in the Middle East,

55:29.040 --> 55:33.040
weakness is taken as a sign that aggression might be an appropriate response.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.320
That is how things work in the Middle East.

55:35.320 --> 55:38.120
And the fact that Barack, that Joe Biden, rather,

55:39.040 --> 55:42.560
came into office with an orientation toward continuing the Biden,

55:42.760 --> 55:46.440
the Obama policies in Iran has led to conflagrations,

55:46.440 --> 55:50.360
these sort of brushfires breaking out everywhere that Iran has borders

55:50.560 --> 55:53.520
with either the West or Israel or both. Right.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.920
Any place that's happening is leading to brushfires, because, again,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.880
the logic of violence in the Middle East is not quite the logic of violence

55:58.880 --> 56:00.440
in other places in the world.

56:00.440 --> 56:01.760
By the way, I think the logic of violence in the Middle East

56:01.760 --> 56:03.840
is actually closer to what most international politics looks like

56:03.840 --> 56:05.520
than we than we wish that it were.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.000
I mean, I think that's part of what's happening in Ukraine as well.

56:08.080 --> 56:10.720
So you think which brings me, by the way, here's my question about Ukraine.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.000
We'll just wait and then you can go for it.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
So you think that for Iran, right, a country that has been sanctioned

56:16.000 --> 56:18.760
for God knows how many years now, you think that for Iran,

56:18.760 --> 56:21.720
just continuing to sanction them and contain them is an effective way

56:22.040 --> 56:25.040
is more effective than trying to engage them in bilateral

56:25.040 --> 56:27.280
or multilateral peace talks? Yes, 100 percent.

56:27.560 --> 56:28.480
And the proof is in the pudding.

56:28.480 --> 56:30.480
Before we go to Ukraine, can I ask about Israel?

56:30.640 --> 56:33.000
So you're both mostly in agreement.

56:33.360 --> 56:35.280
But what is it? I don't know if I'd say that. OK.

56:35.280 --> 56:40.000
But as I'm learning, what is Israel doing right?

56:40.000 --> 56:45.680
What is Israel doing wrong in this very specific current war in Gaza?

56:47.480 --> 56:50.040
I mean, frankly, I think that what Israel's doing wrong is if I were Israel.

56:50.240 --> 56:53.800
OK, like, again, America's interests are not coincident with Israel's interests.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.320
If if I were an Israeli leader,

56:57.240 --> 57:00.960
I would have swiveled up and out and knocked the bleep out of Hezbollah early.

57:01.200 --> 57:02.280
What does that mean?

57:02.280 --> 57:03.760
So I would have I would.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.600
Yoav Galant, who is the defense minister of Israel, was encouraging Netanyahu,

57:06.600 --> 57:09.200
who is the prime minister, and the war cabinet, including Benny Gantz.

57:09.200 --> 57:10.880
So whenever people talk about the Netanyahu government,

57:10.880 --> 57:11.880
that's not what's in place right now.

57:11.880 --> 57:14.640
There's a unity war government in place that includes the political opposition.

57:15.200 --> 57:16.920
The reason I point that out is because there are a lot of people

57:16.920 --> 57:19.680
politically who will suggest that the actions Israel is currently taking

57:19.680 --> 57:22.920
are somehow the manifestation of a right wing government.

57:22.920 --> 57:25.160
Israel currently does not have a quote unquote right wing government.

57:25.160 --> 57:26.880
They have unity government that includes the opposition.

57:26.880 --> 57:29.880
In any case, Yoav Galant was urging in the very early days of the war

57:29.880 --> 57:32.320
that Israel should turn north and instead of hitting Hamas,

57:32.600 --> 57:35.200
they should actually take the opportunity to knock Hezbollah out

57:35.200 --> 57:37.880
because Hezbollah is significantly more dangerous to the existence

57:37.880 --> 57:39.280
of the state of Israel than Hamas.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.520
I actually agree with that.

57:40.520 --> 57:44.560
As far as what Israel has been doing wrong in the actual war.

57:45.400 --> 57:48.240
I mean, I think that.

57:48.240 --> 57:51.920
Again, from an American perspective, I think that Israel is doing pretty well

57:51.920 --> 57:52.880
from an Israeli perspective.

57:52.880 --> 57:55.800
If I were Israeli, I would actually want Israel to be less

57:56.800 --> 58:00.640
loose about sending its soldiers in on the ground level.

58:00.880 --> 58:02.840
So Israel is attempting to minimize civilian casualties,

58:02.840 --> 58:05.840
and the cost of that has been the highest military death toll

58:05.840 --> 58:08.320
that Israel has had since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

58:08.600 --> 58:11.400
I mean, I personally know through one degree of separation,

58:11.400 --> 58:13.080
three separate people have been killed in Gaza.

58:13.080 --> 58:15.280
And that's because they're going in door to door.

58:15.360 --> 58:18.720
It's because they're they're attempting to minimize civilian casualties.

58:19.040 --> 58:22.400
And they're losing a lot of guys in this particular in this particular war.

58:23.360 --> 58:25.920
You know, the the problem that Israel has had, historically speaking,

58:25.920 --> 58:29.160
is that Israel got very complacent about its own security situation.

58:29.160 --> 58:31.960
They believe the technology was going to somehow correct

58:31.960 --> 58:35.480
for the hatred on the other side of the wall that very OK.

58:35.480 --> 58:38.200
So our people have to live underground for two weeks at a time

58:38.200 --> 58:39.280
while some rockets fall.

58:39.280 --> 58:40.640
But at least it's not a war.

58:40.640 --> 58:45.200
And that complacence, you know, bred what happened on October 7th.

58:45.200 --> 58:49.160
So to me, what Israel did wrong was years and years and years

58:49.160 --> 58:53.040
of complacence and belief in an Oslo system that is at root a failure

58:53.280 --> 58:54.960
because you cannot make a peace agreement with people

58:54.960 --> 58:56.560
who do not want to make peace with you.

58:56.560 --> 58:58.240
So that's what I think Israel is doing wrong.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.280
I have a feeling there's going to be wide divergence on this point.

59:01.280 --> 59:03.680
Um, maybe.

59:03.680 --> 59:06.480
So in terms of broadly speaking,

59:06.960 --> 59:10.160
I generally oppose settlement expansion is a thing that Israel does incorrectly

59:10.160 --> 59:13.120
that I think is kind of like provocative to at least all the Palestinians

59:13.600 --> 59:17.720
in the West Bank and probably energizes hatred in the Gaza Strip for them as well.

59:17.720 --> 59:20.840
In terms of conducting, in terms of conducting warfare,

59:21.440 --> 59:25.200
the one thing that I always say to everybody, especially Americans,

59:25.200 --> 59:27.920
is you can't evaluate things from an American perspective.

59:27.920 --> 59:28.760
It's very stupid.

59:28.760 --> 59:30.520
Happened a lot with Ukraine, where people like, oh, well,

59:30.520 --> 59:33.400
didn't they work with the Nazis and like, weren't the Soviets the good guys?

59:33.400 --> 59:36.080
And it's like, well, in other parts of the world, it's not quite as simple.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.840
And I think the same is true for Israel, Palestine,

59:39.000 --> 59:42.120
that a lot of Americans will analyze the conflict as just being one

59:42.120 --> 59:44.800
between only Israel and Palestine, which it's not.

59:44.800 --> 59:47.480
It's a conflict between Israel and then Palestine, Hezbollah,

59:47.480 --> 59:50.520
the Houthis and Iran. Right now it is.

59:50.520 --> 59:53.320
I think that the however, one area where I break with Ben is,

59:53.320 --> 59:56.360
is I think that minimizing civilian casualties and everything is very,

59:56.360 --> 59:57.080
very, very important.

59:57.080 --> 59:59.160
I think on the Israeli side, I don't think it's important

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.080
so that the U.S. will stay with them, because I think the U.S.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.720
is probably going to stick with Israel as long as they don't do anything crazy.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.080
And I don't even think it matters for the international community.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.600
It doesn't definitely matter for the UN because Jesus Christ.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.120
However, I think it's really, really, really important that

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.680
I think that in the Middle East, broadly speaking,

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.800
I think that leadership, especially in the Gulf,

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.040
has gotten over the Palestinian issue.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.440
I think that leadership is kind of like they don't care as much anymore.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.920
But the populations still care quite a bit.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.600
And I think that the main issue that Israel could run into is

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.840
if the civilian death toll does climb too high and if they start to hit

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.840
this 40, 50, 60 thousand number of civilian casualties,

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.600
they run the risk of the civilian populations in the surrounding

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.400
Middle Eastern states becoming so antagonistic towards Israel

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:47.120
that they start to take steps back towards normalization in the region.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.520
So, for instance, I know that Bahrain, I think,

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.240
already pulled out their ambassador to Israel.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.480
My guess is going to be it's temporary.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:58.160
I know that on the on the public speaking side,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.320
you've got a lot of people condemning Israel for the attacks.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.600
And on the private side, you've got people telling Israel,

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.120
please kill all of Hamas, because this is untenable.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.360
Nobody wants to work in this situation.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.440
I don't know if this ended up being true or not.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.480
I'm guessing it didn't.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.400
But I saw on a couple of Twitter accounts, it was leaked that potentially Saudi

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.640
Arabia was considering installing a government in the West Bank that they would run.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.920
No, I mean, I think Israel would love nothing better than that.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.320
But that is for sure.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:23.480
One of the big problems in the Middle East

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:26.600
is literally no one wants to preside over the Palestinians.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.280
Yes, no one. So I think the Arab states, Israel, no one.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.120
So I think the issue and I think and I'm largely actually I'm very sympathetic

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.600
towards the Palestinians because I think that for since 48 and onwards,

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.640
I think that all of the Arab states super gassed them up on that.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.160
They wanted the Palestinians to fight because they wanted to fight with Israel.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.720
However, as time has gone on and they realize that it's kind of a lost cause,

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.440
states have started to drop out.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.120
So you're getting these bilateral peace treaties with Egypt and with Jordan.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.360
You're getting multilateral agreements like the Abraham Accords.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.520
And now the Palestinians are looking around and like, OK, well,

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.760
you guys told us to fight all this time.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:02.000
And now the only people that we have supporting us are Iranian proxies.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.920
So the Palestinians are in a very weird spot where they've like lost all their support.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:10.120
Yeah, I think that I think that Israel, what I would say to be,

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.320
quote unquote, critical of Israel is Israel needs to take strong steps

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.160
towards peace that probably involves them enduring some undue hardship.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.800
So not the October 7th attacks, because Jesus, that's way too much.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.200
But, you know, other types of, you know, attacks that they might have to deal with

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.760
that might cause some civilians to die that they don't come out over the top

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.680
with and and retaliate with if there's ever going to be peace in that region.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.080
However, another thing that I've always said is a huge problem

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:36.600
between Israel and Palestine is I think that both sides think

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.880
that if they continue to fight, it will be good for them.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.400
But the problem is one side is delusional.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.720
Israel, I think Israel wants to continue to fight

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:48.840
because they get justifications for the annexation of the Golan Heights.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.760
They get justifications for expansions, especially in area C

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.800
that I think they're probably going to try to annex soon.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.920
They get justifications for the increased military posturing

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.960
towards the Gaza Strip and the embargoes.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.440
And Israel is right that if the conflict continues, really,

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.720
the situation only improves for Israel over time.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.760
But the Palestinians also all believe that if they keep fighting,

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.560
they thought that since 2000 or Arafat that if they just keep fighting,

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.200
they'll get better gains, too.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200
But that's not the case.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.920
Is there a difference between Palestinian citizens

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.520
and the leadership when you say that?

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.960
I love all people.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.520
I love all people around the world.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.920
And I think that when we analyze issues, I think that we have to be very honest

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.480
with what the people on the ground think.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.960
And the idea that Hamas is just this one off thing

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:31.200
in the Gaza Strip is not only incorrect with the situation on the ground,

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.160
it's also incredibly ahistorical.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.400
And the idea that like the Palestinians in the West Bank,

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.480
of which I believe the most recent polling shows,

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.560
I want to say 75 to 80 percent support the October 7th attacks.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.240
Palestinians in general want to fight in violent conflict with Israel.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.480
That's not just the position of the government.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.720
That's not just people.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.360
There's a reason why Abbas doesn't want to do elections in the West Bank.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.480
And it's because the Palestinian people really do want to fight with Israel.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.920
But to combat that problem is like you have to get the UN on board.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.640
We've got to do an actual addressing of the Palestinian refugee problem,

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.640
which is handled like a joke right now.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.200
Iran has to be brought to the table in terms of negotiations.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.680
There has to be huge efforts made to economically revitalize these like Palestinian areas,

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.600
even though they're one of the highest recipients of aid in the world.

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.000
You have to do something about the embargo and the blockade in the Gaza Strip,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.960
which isn't just maintained by Israel, it's also maintained by Egypt.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.840
You should ask why.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.960
Yeah, there's a lot of things that have to happen to fix that problem.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.600
But the reality is, is I don't think Israel really wants to

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.080
because they get to continue their expansion into the West Bank.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.840
And I don't think anybody around the world really cares that much.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.760
So I will argue with that.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.240
The idea that Israel does not want to end the conflict

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.960
is belied by the history of what just happened with the Gaza Strip.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.560
So when we talk about settlements, for example,

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.240
Israel did have settlements inside the Gaza Strip.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.400
There were 8,000 Jews who were living inside the Gaza Strip in Gush Katif.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.320
Up until 2005, they withdrew all of those people.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.840
I mean, took them literally out of their homes.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:00.440
And the result was not the burgeoning of a better attitude

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.440
toward the state of Israel with regard to, for example,

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.920
the Palestinian population in Gaza.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.800
In fact, it was more radical in Gaza than it was in the West Bank.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.480
The result was obviously the election of Hamas,

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.560
the October 7th attacks in which, unfortunately,

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.760
many civilians took part in the October 7th attacks.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.080
There's video of people rushing who are civilians

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.200
and dressed in civilian clothing into Israeli villages.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:22.920
Always the same thing.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.120
That is 100% true, obviously.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.040
And when it comes to Area C and Israel's supposed deep

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.240
and abiding desire for territorial expansion in Area C.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.040
Area C, so for those who are not familiar with the Oslo course,

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.080
and again, this is getting very abstruse,

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:41.080
but the Oslo Accords are broken down into three areas of the West Bank.

01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.840
Area A is under full Palestinian control.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.640
That'd be like Jenin and Nablus, the major cities, for example.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.200
There's Area B, which is mixed Israeli-Palestinian control,

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:52.040
where Israel provides some level of military security and control.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:53.560
And then there's Area C.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.560
And Area C was like to be decided later.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.840
It was left up for possible concessions to the Palestinian authority

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:02.600
if the Oslo Accords had moved forward.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.120
Those are disputed territories.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.200
There is building taking place in Area C by both.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.320
Actually, no one talks about this, but by Palestinians as well as Israelis.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.800
And the question is whether, if Israel stopped building,

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.400
there have been many settlement frees in the past,

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.000
including some undertaken by Netanyahu.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.000
And it actually has not done one iota of good

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.680
in moving the ball forward in terms of actual negotiations.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.240
Again, the biggest problem is that the leadership

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.000
for Palestinians has spent every day since, really, 67.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.880
It's not even 48, because between 48 and 67,

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.000
Jordan was in charge of the West Bank,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.280
and Egypt was in charge of the Gaza Strip.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.120
And at no point did either of those powers say,

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.760
hey, maybe we ought to hand this over to an independent Palestinian state,

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:45.880
which was originally the division that was promoted by the UN Partition Plan in 47.

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:52.040
Because of that, the leadership post-67 and really starting in 64,

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.920
the Palestine Liberation Organization was founded in 64.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.880
And it called for the liberation of the land.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.080
In 64, they had the West Bank and they had the Gaza Strip.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.600
So they're talking about Tel Aviv.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.520
When it was founded in 64, the basic idea,

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.200
as indicated by that, was Israel will not exist.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.120
And that was a promise that's been made by pretty much every Palestinian leader in Arabic

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.200
to the people that they are talking to.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.760
Yasser Arafat, famously, would do this sort of thing.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.840
He'd speak in English and talk about how he wanted a two-state solution,

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.440
and then he'd go back to his own people and say,

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.320
this is a Trojan horse.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:29.880
If Israel could, if you think that Israeli parents want to send their kids at the age of 18

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:36.040
to go and monitor Jenin and Nablus and be in Hanunas, you're out of your mind.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.920
You're out of your mind.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.960
Israelis do not want that.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.920
In fact, Israelis didn't want that so much that they allowed rockets to fall in their cities

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.560
for full-on 18 years in order to avoid sending soldiers en masse back into the Gaza Strip.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.520
True, but I think Israel does want to continue to expand settlements into the West Bank, right?

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.480
They want to continue to build.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.800
They want to have all of Jerusalem, East Jerusalem as well.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.320
Well, I mean, East Jerusalem has already been annexed.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.640
So East Jerusalem is, according to Israel, a part of Israel.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.520
That's not a settlement.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.800
OK, so there's that.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.960
With regard to, you know, does Israel have an interest in expanding settlements in the West

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.600
Bank? Why would they not until there's a peace partner?

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.400
Sure, that's what I mean.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.040
But I'm saying as long as the conflict continues, like, because even when you talk about the-

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.920
No, but your suggestion is that they're incentivizing the conflict to continue so

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.720
they can grab more land.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.840
Well, let me be very clear.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.200
I don't think there's like a plan.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.040
So some people say, for instance, they'll take that one quote from Netanyahu and they'll try

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.720
to say that he was funding the people in the Gaza Strip by allowing Qatari money to come in,

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.600
even though he was actually speaking in opposition to Abbas allowing the Gaza Strip

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.080
to fall for Netanyahu to clear it out for him and they give it back, et cetera, et cetera.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.080
I'm not claiming those theories.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:32.680
I'm just saying that I think that Israel will take a relatively neutral stance

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.680
towards conflict enduring because as long as the conflict endures and as long as the

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:41.400
settlements can expand, I think that ultimately benefits Israel.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.960
I think there would be very- Let's put it this way.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.880
If suddenly there arose among the Palestinians a deep and abiding desire for peace,

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.480
approved by a vast majority of the population with serious security guarantees,

01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:55.480
I think you'd be very hard pressed to find Israelis who would not be willing

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.840
to at least consider that in return for not expanding bathrooms in Efrat.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.320
I would have agreed with you on October 6th. I think we're probably a year or two away from

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.240
that right now. No, but the point I'm making is that Israelis now realize that the entire peace

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.120
process was a sham, meaning the people who are on the other side of the table were using it as a

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:14.920
Trojan horse in the first place. The death of Oslo is not the death of Israeli hopefulness.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:19.160
It's the death of the illusion that on the other side of the table was anyone worth bargaining

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.520
with. That's what's happening and that's why you have this sort of insane disconnect right

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.720
now between the United States and the Israeli government. Again, it's a unity government.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.760
No one in Israel is talking about making concessions to the Palestinian authority

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.360
for a wide variety of reasons, including the fact that Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah continues to pay

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:35.640
actual families of terrorists who killed Jews. Sure, the Mark Fund, yeah.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.840
Right? Which is from the moderate West Bank.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:45.640
Right, exactly. So again, the taste in Israel for this is even the people who are the Chilonim,

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.600
right? Those are the most secular people in Israel, which was, by the way, the place that

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.880
was attacked on October 7th. I mean, what people should understand is that October 7th

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.880
was not an attack against settlements in the West Bank. It was an attack on peace villages

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:59.800
that were essentially disarmed and many of these people who were killed were peace activists who

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.600
were literally trying to work with people in Gaza to get them jobs. I mean, it's just mind-boggling.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.440
That's why you had this ground shift in Israel. The next 20 years in Israel is going to be about

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.680
security and economic development, period, end of story. Everything else goes second, third place.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:17.000
And I will say, I agree essentially with everything you're saying, not to loop back

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.360
on another topic, but this is one of the reasons then why I was so critical. I don't want to say

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.040
critical, but like kind of nonchalant about the Abraham Accords, because they didn't address

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.680
anything with the Palestinians whatsoever. They brought up countries that weren't super relevant

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.480
to the conflict. They didn't bring in Qatar, which is where a lot of the money and support

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.360
for the Gaza Strip comes from. They didn't involve Iran at all. They involved bilateral-

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.800
No, but it totally changed the mentality. And this is why, what I'm seeing right now, this is why,

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.560
listen, I think that Biden has done better than I certainly expected him to do in terms of support

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:44.760
for Israel. Obama was way less supportive of Israel than Biden by every metric. With that said,

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.800
the rhetoric that he's been using recently and the blanket I've been using recently about Israel

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:53.080
needs to make painful concessions for peace, re-centering this issue at the center of relations

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:59.960
in the Middle East is doomed to failure. The magic, magic is a strong word, the benefit of the

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:04.520
Abraham Accords was proof of what you're saying, which is true, which is that all of these

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.520
surrounding countries in reality have abandoned the idea that there is a centrality to the

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.360
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. That is not the central conflict in the Middle East. And by the

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.920
way, one of the reasons it's not the central conflict in the Middle East is because actually,

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.680
ironically, because of the rise of Iran. It's Sunni states that are largely signing up with

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.280
Israel because they're realizing they need some sort of counterweight to a burgeoning

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:30.360
nuclear power in Iran. Can we talk about Ukraine? Sure. You have a disagreement with what Destiny

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:38.040
said. My main problem with Biden's policy with regard to Ukraine is that he outsourced the end

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:45.240
goal of the war to Zelensky early on. Now, that might make sense if that goal were something that

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:50.200
he was willing to fund to the point of achievement, or if Zelensky could have achieved it on his own.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.800
But right now, and this has been true since pretty early on in the war as Henry Kissinger made,

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.400
pretty early on in the war it was very clear that, for example,

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:03.320
Crimea was going nowhere. The Russians had control of Crimea, barring the United States,

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.320
giving permission to fly F-16s over Crimea, nothing was going to change over there. The same

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:12.280
thing was true in most of the Donbas, in Luhansk and Donetsk. That was not going to change.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.600
Zelensky's stated goal, and you understand it, he's the leader of Ukraine, is that there was

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.000
a predation on his territory in 2014, and that the Russians sent their little green men across

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.040
the border and then they took all of these areas. So he, as leader of Ukraine, is saying,

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:28.280
okay, I want all of that back. Now, the reality is that the U.S.'s interests had largely been

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:33.320
achieved in the first few months of the war, meaning the revocation of the ability of Russia

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:39.400
to take Ukraine and just ingest it, and two, the devastation of Russia's military capability.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:44.040
Russia has just been wrecked. Their military is in serious straits because of the war in Ukraine.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.720
From an American perspective, I'm very much pro all of that. I think we have an interest

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.760
in Ukraine maintaining a buffer status against a territorially aggressive Russia. I think that

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.600
the United States does have an interest in degrading the Russian military to the extent

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.440
that it can't threaten the Baltic states or threaten Kazakhstan or other countries in the

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:07.240
region. The problem I have with Biden's strategy is, as always, I think that it's a muddle,

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:11.560
and I think muddles tend to end with misperceptions. War tends to break out

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.760
and maintain because of misperception. Misperception of the other side's strength,

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.880
the other side's intentions, and all of the rest. People misperceive what's going to happen. They

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.680
say, I'll cross that line and nothing will happen, right? This is what Putin thought.

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:25.160
He thought, I'll cross that line. They'll greet me as a liberator, and because the United States

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.680
just surrendered in Afghanistan, essentially, they won't do anything, and the West is fragmenting

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.720
because NATO is fragmenting and all the rest of this. Obviously, he was wrong on all of those

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:40.360
scores. The problem for Biden is that, as with virtually every war, no end line was set. It

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:43.800
became out recently. It was widely reported that actually there was a peace deal that was on the

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:48.520
table in the first few months that Putin was on board with that basically would have ceded

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.880
Luhansk and Donetsk and Crimea to Russia in return for solidification of those lines,

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.360
American and Western security guarantees to Ukraine. Ukraine wouldn't formally join NATO,

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.960
but there would be security guarantees to Ukraine. We're ending up there anyway. It's

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.880
just taking a lot more money and a lot more time to get there. Do you think Trump would have helped

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.200
push that peace? Yes, and I think that Biden actually did Zelensky a bit of a disservice

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.400
because Zelensky knows where this war is going to end, and it's not going to end with Luhansk and

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:17.720
Donetsk and Crimea in Ukrainian hands. It's just not going to, and he knows that. What actually,

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:25.320
in my opinion, Zelensky needed was for Joe Biden to be the person who foisted that deal upon him

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.480
so that he could then go back to his own people and say, listen, guys, I wanted all those things,

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:32.280
but the Americans weren't willing to allow me to have all those things.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.160
We did an amazing job. We did a heroic job in defending our own land. We devastated the

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:41.000
Russian military, even though no one expected us to, but we can't get back those things because

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
it's unrealistic to get back those things because America, basically, they're a big funder and

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.280
they're the ones who want the deal. Instead, what Biden said, and this was reported in The

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.440
Washington Post last year, the Biden administration said, we're going to fight for as long as it takes

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:57.800
with as much as it takes, and when they were asked until when, they said, whatever Zelensky says,

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:04.760
and that's not a policy. That's just a recipe for a frozen conflict with endless funding.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.040
Now, it may be that Putin has walked away from the table and that deal is no longer available.

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.480
If that deal is available right now, I certainly hope that's being pursued

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:17.400
behind closed doors. My main critique, again, of Biden is that when you outsource the end goal

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.240
to another country without stating what America's interest is, that's a problem.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:24.920
I also think that Biden did really quite a poor job of explaining what America's

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:30.680
realistic interests are. I don't like it when American leaders... It's weird for me to say this,

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.840
but I'm not a huge fan of the we're in it to protect democracy kind of rhetoric

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.520
because, frankly, we are allied with many, many countries that are not democracies,

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:45.400
and that's not actually how foreign policy works. We should, as an overall 30,000 foot goal,

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:52.360
advance democracy and rights where we can, but the reason that we were fighting in favor of

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.800
Ukraine, and when I say fighting, I mean giving them money and giving them weaponry, the reason

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:01.400
that we were doing that in favor of Ukraine is not because of Ukraine's long history of clean voting

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.560
and non-corruption. The reason that we were doing that is to counter Russian interests in the region.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:10.200
I mean, it was a pure, real politic play, and that real politic play is hard to deny no matter what

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:15.720
side of the aisle you're on. I think that what many Americans are reverting to is we have no

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.400
interest there, why are we spending money there and not spending money here, and that kind of

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.920
stuff. That argument can always be applied unless you actually articulate the reason why it is good

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:26.760
for Americans beyond simply the ideological for the United States to be involved in a thing.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:33.080
For example, I think right now, I think that what Biden just did, the United States as we speak,

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.360
is striking the Houthis. I think that that's a really, really good thing. I think that's a

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.120
necessary thing, and I think American people should understand why that is happening. It's

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:46.120
not because of, quote unquote, ideology. It is, I mean, on a very root level, but really it's because

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.520
you're screwing up the straits. I mean, you can't do that. You can't screw up free trade,

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.800
and Americans have an interest in not seeing all of our prices at the grocery store double and

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:59.800
triple because a bunch of ragtag pirates, akin to the Barbary pirates from 1800, are bothering

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.760
everyone. Ben said a lot there. Do you disagree with any aspect on the Ukraine side? A little bit,

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.240
yeah. I think on the macro, I agree. Maybe we get at the wheeze a little bit on some things.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:13.640
On the final thing that he said, though, I wish that Americans could have honest conversations

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.880
about foreign policy. I think that it would just be better for everybody. I don't know if it's

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:23.800
Red Scare after the Cold War, where it was literally the behemoths were fighting against

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.280
communism, and we felt like after 91, every single foreign policy decision needs to be able to be

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:34.280
explained in seven words. He's the bad guy, and that's it. I wish we had more honest

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:39.240
conversations about what our foreign policy interest is in a particular region because

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:43.800
I don't think most Americans honestly could even articulate why Israel would be an important ally

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.440
or why it's important to defend Ukraine against Russia or why should we care about Taiwan at all.

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:51.720
I don't know if most Americans could articulate anything there, even though they might have very

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:56.200
strong opinions about why we ought to be involved in certain conflicts. I do agree with that. I

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:02.280
wish we had more honest conversations about foreign policy. In terms of how Biden has handled

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:06.840
Ukraine, the things that I liked the most were, one, that he was very clear in the beginning about

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.600
what we wouldn't do. Biden's saying that we're not going to do, not a red light, no fly zones

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.720
over Ukraine. We're not going to be deploying troops on the ground in Ukraine. We're not going

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.280
to be doing anything that would have US soldiers and Russian soldiers crossing swords with each

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.280
other. That's not going to happen. I like that he made that very clear at the beginning. I like

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:30.200
that he coalition built between NATO and the EU to get people to send funds, training, soldiers,

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.640
airplanes, and everything to Ukraine. I thought those two things were really good. In terms of

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:39.800
basically writing Zelensky a blank check, I would like to hope that Biden and the entire United

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:45.000
States learned a lesson from Iraq and Afghanistan that open-ended missions with unlimited budgets

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.600
and no clear goal are the worst foreign policy decisions you can ever do. They've defined US

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:54.920
foreign policy for the past two or three decades, which is unfortunate, but seems to be the case.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:00.040
Um, my, my feeling would be, and this is just a feeling, I don't know if internal cables have

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:05.800
leaked that say otherwise, is the, uh, the Biden administration has probably always had a quiet

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.800
position of at some point there's going to be an off-ramp here. And I think even a month or two

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:14.040
ago, I think those talks were being leaked, that discussion had begun with Zelensky looking for an

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.120
off-ramp, but publicly, of course, the United States is never going to come out and say,

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.120
we are going to support you guys to fight as much as you want for three months. And then after that,

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.440
it's no more. Obviously that can't be the statement. It's always going to be that we're

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.640
going to support you in your fight against Russia. And we tried that under Obama with Afghanistan.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.880
It was terrible. Sure. Yeah. You can't escalate the troop levels to X, but only for six months.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.920
And then you can't, you just can't do that. It's always going to come off as we're going to support

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.800
you forever. And as long as it takes, and as long as you need whatever we have to do to defend

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:44.280
freedom and democracy in your country and any, any other statement would be absurd. So I can

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.920
understand why it feels like on a public level, a blank check and an indefinite time period was

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:52.920
granted to Zelensky, but I don't think that's going to be the case. I think I, again, I hope

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.520
we've learned our lessons in the Middle East about the forever wars, that this isn't going to be a

01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:00.920
forever funding to Ukraine to fight for as long as they want. I do disagree. I feel like we're

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:04.280
playing a little bit retrospectively saying that like, well, it's obvious that they're not going

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.640
to capture the Donbass. It's obvious that they're not going to capture Crimea. I agree for Crimea.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:12.040
That was incredibly obvious, but it was also really obvious that in two weeks Russia would own Kiev

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:16.840
and Ukraine was going to be Belarus 2.0. I think that even for a lot of military people

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:23.000
and analysts around the world, that that was an expectation or at least a significant probability.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.040
Nobody knew the phrase that's thrown around now is paper tiger, that Russia's military was as

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:32.360
ill-equipped as they were. So I can understand why, especially if you're Ukraine and if you've

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.720
repelled an invasion from one of the world's largest armies, why you might feel like, well,

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.760
fuck it, you know, let's fight for a few months, let's fight for a year, let's see what happens.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.680
And I can understand the United States supporting them, but I agree that there has to be some

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.200
reasonable off-ramp where we're not going to fight forever. I think the U.S. State Department has

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.960
already begun those conversations with Zelensky to look at what that off-ramp looks like.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:55.720
But yeah, I'm not too sure other than like explicitly stating publicly, like you can only

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.200
fight until this date. I don't really know what else I would change. I don't think the Biden

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.280
administration should have done that. I don't know what else they should have done.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.560
Do you think Biden should cut this deal on the funding? Meaning there's like 60,

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.440
there's this $105 billion deal that's been held up by debate between Republicans and Democrats

01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:15.880
over border, right? So basically it contains $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel,

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:20.200
another several billion dollars for Taiwanese defense against China, and then includes some

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.080
border funding and some border provisions. Republicans want the border funding and the

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:26.360
border provisions because we can get into the illegal immigration issue, but that's a pretty

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:30.440
serious issue. And Biden and Democrats have been unwilling to hold that up. And that seems to me

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.360
like just from, put aside Republican, Democrat, it seems like political malpractice, meaning there's

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:38.280
a widespread perception in the United States that the border is a disaster area. Joe Biden wants

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.880
these things. Many Republicans don't want these things. If he caves on the border stuff, he gets

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.640
all the things that he wants and he's going to be able to go back to the moderates in the country

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:48.760
and say, I did something about the border. It seems like such an obvious win. And if he caves

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.640
on the border stuff, you mean on the Ukraine stuff? Yes, because then he gets the whole package.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:55.640
Meaning he can go back to his own base and he can say, listen, guys, I wanted to be easy on

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:59.080
the border. The Republicans forced me to it, but we needed the Ukraine aid. We needed the Taiwanese.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.320
You're honestly, you're going to be more educated than me on this. I don't like,

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.960
or maybe, maybe I just don't know enough. I don't like the principle that when we negotiate things

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.200
in the United States, there's like 50 million hostages at all points in time for every single

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:16.360
thing. Like, oh boy, here comes the debt ceiling. What do the Republicans want? What do the Democrats

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:22.360
want? Oh boy, like here, you know, we can't fund our government. But I mean, obviously the argument

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.640
is going to be that if the Ukraine funding doesn't come in this bill and if Biden and his

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.920
administration feel like it's really important that unilaterally, or not unilaterally, but as a

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:34.680
single issue, it's not going to pass. So I would say that at this point, and I don't know what the

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.000
conversations look like between the Biden administration and Zelensky, I would say at

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.800
this point that it's probably fair to start making contingencies on the money that we give to Ukraine

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:47.960
that listen, like this conflict has, you know, waged on now, like now we need to start looking

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:52.200
for potential peace. We can't just write you an unlimited check. So I mean, if those strings are

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.720
attached, I'd be okay with it. But the broader question of like, is it okay to make this

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.320
particular piece of legislation with all this funding contingent on the Ukrainian funding?

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.520
I mean, that just seems to be the way the government works now, unfortunately.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:08.920
Quick pause, bathroom break. One of the big issues in this presidential election is going to be January

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:14.200
6th. It's in the news now, and I think it's going to get, become bigger and bigger and bigger. So

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:21.000
question for Destiny first. Did Donald Trump incite an insurrection on January 6th, 2021?

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.880
Absolutely. This is probably ignoring every other issue we've talked about,

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.480
of which I think there are plenty that I would say disqualified Trump from holding office.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.920
I think that the conduct and the behavior leading up to and including January 6th,

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:44.120
I think is wildly indefensible. I am excited to see them try to, yeah, the three to four stages

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:50.120
are the, the taking what I think any reasonable person would say knowingly false information

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:54.120
about elections being rigged or ballot boxes being stuffed or Ruby Freeman, you know, running

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:58.680
ballots three times in Georgia, taking that knowingly false information and trying to call

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.280
state secretaries and stuff to have them flip their electoral vote.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:11.000
That was horrible. The plot that Eastman hatched in order to have these like false

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.680
slates of electors where all seven states had citizens go in and falsely say that they were

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:22.760
the duly elected electors that could submit votes to Congress. That was insane. That happened.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:29.480
Asking or begging Pence to accept these false states of electors initially, and then just say,

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.000
you should just throw it out completely and throw it to the house delegation, which was

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.720
majority Republican. That was absolutely unbelievable. Then on the day of January 6th,

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:44.040
trying to capitalize on the violence by him, Giuliani and Eastman making phone calls to

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.800
senators and congressmen saying, well, don't you think maybe you guys should delay the vote a

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.680
little bit? You know, don't you think they're just really mad about the election? I think

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:56.680
you said to McCarthy, they're more upset than you. His utter dereliction of duty and not doing

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.160
anything to stop the rioting that happened on January 6th because he was too busy taking

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:05.320
advantage of it. I think all of these things are horrible. I look forward to seeing the

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:11.240
Jack Smith indictments play out in court, maybe even the Georgia Rico case. But yeah,

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.000
I think all of these things are unfathomable. I think when you look at the plot from start to

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.720
finish, clearly the goal the entire time was to circumvent the peaceful transfer of power. That

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:23.400
was the goal from start to finish, whether it was through false claims, whether it was through

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:27.160
illegal schemes, or whether it was through violence at the Capitol to delay the certification of the

01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:33.720
vote. So I'm glad you're excited. It's always fun. So there are two elements to incitement

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.520
of insurrection. One is incitement, the other is insurrection. So incitement has a legal standard,

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:42.360
so does insurrection. Neither of those standards are met. So if you're asking me,

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.960
morally speaking, did Donald Trump do the right thing between November 4th and January 6th?

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:50.440
I said, I will continue to say no, he did not. I think he was saying things that are false,

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.840
just factually false about his theories with regard to the election, about the election being

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.840
stolen, about fraud. This is all adjudicated in court. He did not even bring many of the claims

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.760
that he's brought publicly and all the rest of that. If we're talking about incitement of

01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.120
insurrection as a legal standard, it doesn't meet any of those standards. When it comes to incitement,

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:10.760
it has to be incitement to immediate lawless action. That's the standard for incitement.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:15.000
And I'm very meticulous in how I use this because I happen to speak publicly a lot,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.240
and that means there are lots of people who listen to me, which means some of those people

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:21.720
are probably crazy. And some of them may go and do a crazy thing. Did I incite them? The media

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:25.400
tends to use the word incitement very loosely with regard to this sort of stuff in the same way that

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.800
Bernie Sanders incited the congressional baseball shooting. He did not. Bernie Sanders has a lot of

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:34.920
things I disagree with. I think Bernie's a schmuck. Doesn't matter. He did not incite that. So saying

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:39.480
bad things is not the same thing as inciting violence. Inciting violence, the legal standard

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:43.960
in the United States is, I want you to go punch that guy in the face. That's inciting. With regard

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.200
to insurrection, typically in insurrection, and there are some descriptions in case law,

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.880
although none in statutory law as far as I'm aware, the typical description in case law

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:56.040
is the replacement of one legitimate government of the United States with another by violent means.

01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:02.120
The notion that Donald Trump coordinated any such insurrection is belied by the FBI itself. The FBI

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:07.320
put out a report in, I believe it was August of 2021, suggesting that there was no well coordinated

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.800
insurrectionist attempt coordinated by the White House. In fact, what you had was Donald Trump

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.200
thrashing around like that weird alien in the movie Life, I don't know if you ever saw it with

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.320
Jake Gyllenhaal, where he's like kind of thrashing up against this glass box, just an alien just

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:24.520
thrashing up against the glass box. That I think is more what you were seeing from November 4th to

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:31.640
January 6th. And then again, the claim that January 6th itself was an insurrection. So virtually,

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.280
I'm not aware that anyone was charged with actual insurrection. There were some people who were

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.880
charged with seditious conspiracy. There are insurrection statutes that do exist. No one was

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.200
charged under those particular statutes. There were some people who you could say

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:47.000
informally had insurrectionist ideas. Those would be the people who want to hang Nancy Pelosi or

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:54.440
kill Mike Pence. And those people are in jail right now. And the election was certified.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:57.640
Mike Pence presided over the certification. Mitch McConnell presided over the certification. Joe

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:02.760
Biden has been the president for the last three years. So Donald Trump, by the way, was still

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.600
president at that point. If he had actively wanted to do what other people who have actually launched

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:10.600
coups have done, he would have theoretically called the National Guard not to put down the riot,

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.720
but to actually depose the sitting government of the United States in the name of a specious

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:19.240
legal theory. He did not do that. He did not attempt that. Nobody working for him

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.240
did that. The most you can say, I think, about what everybody was doing is that,

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.480
you know, and I want to say everybody. We can talk about Trump because this is really about Trump.

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:32.840
He used a phrase that Trump was disseminating knowingly false information. The word that's

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:39.000
carrying a lot of weight there is the word knowingly. So knowingly implies a nowhere.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.520
Do I think the information he was disseminating was false? Yes. Do I think that Donald Trump has

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:47.080
unique capacity to convince himself of nearly anything that is to his own benefit? Absolutely.

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:51.080
And I think that that's actually what Donald Trump was doing there. And the evidence of that

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.200
is Donald Trump being a human and all of us watching him for the last several years.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.720
So, you know, the idea that that he knew it to be false, I'm not even sure those standards

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:03.480
apply in any like just assessing him as a human, which is really what we're being asked to do

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.960
because there's an intent element to this crime. Does Donald Trump, do you think that today Donald

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:14.120
Trump knows that he lost the election? Absolutely. So I, I don't actually. I think when we. So I'm

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.040
glad that you have the attorney background. When we are assessing mens rea, when we're looking at

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.040
certain criminal statutes where intent is required to reasonable person standard, right?

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:26.760
But a reasonable person have known that they were. No, it depends on the mens rea standard. So it's

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:31.400
not the same in every case. If you have to establish individual intent, then it's not

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.120
enough to say a reasonable person should have known. That would be enough for a negligent

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:37.800
statute. Usually when you're talking about reasonable people, person statutes, just legally

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.960
speaking, a reasonable person statute is should a reasonable person have known, that's when you get

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:45.560
to like manslaughter. You can't do a reasonable person standard on like first degree murder.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.840
So you have to establish actual motive in first degree murder. But for first degree murder,

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:53.640
you don't need the statement of I plan to kill this person or I intend to kill this person.

01:29:53.640 --> 01:30:00.840
We can prove that state of mind. So I feel like my feeling for Donald Trump was there were all

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.920
these people around him that he trusted to investigate election fraud. He trusted bar in

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:09.320
the DOJ. He asked Pence, his vice president to look into it. He asked his chief of staff,

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.640
he asked his legal counsel, so many people that ostensibly he trusts them if he's asking them to

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:17.560
look into it. And when all of them looked into it and reported back to him, no, we found nothing.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:22.280
What, unless we're going to literally make the concession that Trump might actually be a delusional

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:26.520
psycho man, at that point, should he not have realized like, well, okay, maybe that's nice

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.920
thing he should have realized the day of the election that he lost the election, but that's

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:33.880
not but that's not I'm saying that like at that point, should he not have known that for him to

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.760
go and propagate those claims that he'd asked all of the people he trusted to research and then for

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:43.720
him to take those claims to Michigan and to Georgia and then publicly and to try to convince people

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:46.600
to throw out the election, you don't think that you're doing the same thing you're reverting to

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.800
should a reasonable person have known? Yes, a reasonable person should have known did Donald

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:54.280
Trump know that's that's a different that's a different question. And so conflating those

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:57.240
two questions is going to get you into some message here. By the way, this is why Jack Smith

01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:01.240
charged the way Jack Smith charged. Yeah, which was I did not charge conspiracy. Jack Smith did

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:06.440
not charge insurrection. He did not charge seditious conspiracy, right? If he the reason

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:11.560
is because Jack Smith is a good lawyer, what he's doing is he's actually broadly, I would say,

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:17.320
pretty obviously expanding statutory coverage in weird areas in order to cover a thing that

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.520
doesn't quite fit into any of these legal categories. But the point that I'm making

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:23.400
is that Jack Smith is on my side of this. He doesn't think that he can actually establish

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:29.000
the intent necessary to convict under a seditious conspiracy or or an insurrection. I agree with

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.240
that. But I think a lot of the underlying facts, though, because he does bring up those calls to

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.160
Raffensperger in Georgia, he does bring up in the indictments that they were knowingly false

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.520
information. So it seems like that's going to be part of the case, maybe not to convict on any of

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.960
the four particular charges that he mentioned, but it seems like that's probably going to be part of

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:49.080
of what he's going to have to establish in court to convict Trump. So I want to look at the actual

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:53.240
text of the charges. So I'm sorry that I don't have the memorization. I believe one's a fraud

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:56.360
charge that generally does not apply to cases like this. Generally, the fraud charge is like

01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:00.200
you're trying to steal money from the government. It's been used pretty broadly in the past,

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:03.720
though it doesn't have to just be because Smith has done oral arguments in response to a lot of

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:07.240
the claims by Trump's lawyers. This was one of them. The infinite civil and criminal immunity

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:11.000
was another one of them where he cites past cases where these types of things, because I think it

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.440
was to defraud of civil rights, I think was the fourth charge. Right. So the defraud of civil

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:18.120
rights is usually somebody standing in the actual like voting house door and preventing you from

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:22.920
voting, not you have a specious legal theory that you espouse in court about whether those votes

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:28.200
should be thrown out. Sure. Although I don't like the when we say specious legal theory and novel

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:32.760
application, which I do agree some of these in some ways is novel. I don't think we've ever

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:37.320
also had a president try to do this before. It is a novel situation where somebody has resisted

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:41.960
the peaceful transfer of power in this clear way. Well, if you're talking about the legal cases,

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:47.320
I mean, that's not true. But Gore sued in 2000. I mean, so that so like comparable to Gore,

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:50.120
if this was comparable to Gore, they're not saying it's comparable to Gore. I'm saying that

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:56.760
if the idea is that espousing a legal theory in court amounts to de facto, some form of election

01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:03.320
denial or interference in some way that that can't that that's not as a general principle,

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:07.240
it's overinclusive. Sure, Gore wasn't trying to decertify the vote, though, for states,

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:10.200
right? They challenged their thing to the Supreme Court, they lost their case in the Supreme Court,

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.640
and then power transfer happened. Right. And Donald Trump had a bunch of legal challenges,

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.880
and then he had a rally, and then there was a riot, and then he left power.

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:22.200
Yeah, but but the Eastman theory of what Pence could do in Congress is a far cry away.

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:26.680
Truly shitty theory. I mean, make no mistake. But not just shitty. I think that if any Democrat had

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:31.000
done this, I think that I feel like we'd be looking at it in a far different lens,

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:36.600
as in we would be using terms like attempted coup, subversion of peaceful transfer of power.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.560
If, if a Democrat vice president had tried to essentially say that in

01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.840
Congress, they could throw away the vote. So I think what I want to get to here,

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:52.520
actually, so we can be more specific is why are these terms important? We agree on largely

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:57.960
speaking, what happened. I think the characterization of the term we are we, we keep kind of bouncing

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:01.640
around between two different different categories. And I want to make sure we can dump the legal

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.680
stuff. Okay, okay. So we're just looking at insight, because as you said, Jack, Jack Smith,

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.280
nobody's charging with incitement, right? I don't believe insurrection is a part of it. So we're

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.360
dumping legal I just in terms of like, a president that is trying to prevent the peaceful transfer

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:17.080
power. So we do call that a bloodless coup or a coup or whatever contemporaneous term you want to

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:23.080
use, right? So prevent the peaceful transfer of power with all means or using means that are

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:27.880
inappropriate, not quite the same thing using meaning appropriate or illegal. Okay. inappropriate

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:31.240
Okay, so illegal, I don't think so. I don't I don't think that these charges actually meet

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.920
the criteria for the for the various charges. And we can discuss each case if you want. Sure.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:41.320
Um, as far as inappropriate, sure, I think in terms of inappropriate stuff. I mean, inappropriate

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:44.360
seems not the word inappropriate, though, is because then conservatives are very quick to

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.720
say, well, sure, he was inappropriate, but everybody's inappropriate. I mean, I'll concede

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.680
that he's more appropriate than others. I just don't see most inappropriate. Sure. Okay. I mean,

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:57.080
that's important to me, though. Does that not bother you that, like, Donald Trump

01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:04.680
sought through legal and extra legal and, and Trump magical ways of trying to entrench his

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.040
power as president passed when he should have been able to? Is that not something that was

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:15.080
incredibly troublesome? I mean, the question to me is the bigger question that I think the Democrats

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.080
are trying to promote this election cycle, which is this means he is a threat to democracy sufficient

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:24.440
that if he were to win the election, there would not be another. But he tried to do that last time.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:28.840
Could he not try to do it next time? I mean, he could try to do whatever he wants, presumably,

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.760
and he would fail the same way that he did last time. Why do we think that? Because he failed.

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.480
Because he failed once, he could never succeed. Yes. Like, let's say hypothetically,

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:44.280
good Lord, save me. Let's say hypothetically, Giuliani was the next head of the Department of

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.640
Justice. Giuliani was the next attorney general. How would he be confirmed?

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:54.440
Well, I'm not entirely sure if because so much of the Republican Party, despite feeling like they

01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.880
don't support Trump when it comes time to actually back him in Congress. Also, I'd have to check

01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:01.960
whether he would be barred by criminal conviction from holding I don't know the answer to that.

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:06.040
Sure. Yeah. Well, yeah, we're this, especially the 14th Amendment. We're figuring out right now.

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:11.480
Yeah. But I mean, like, say, if not Giuliani, say if there are any other number of insane people

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.960
that Trump could theoretically put on his side of the government that wouldn't tell him no last

01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:20.040
next time, because there were a lot of people that rebuked him. There were Republicans and

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.800
in a lot of the states, right? Raffensperger is one of them. There were Republicans in his

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:29.480
own administration. You've got Rosen. Right. Got Barr. There was his own vice president. But like,

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.400
theoretically, next time, and I feel like last time going in, I'm going to do a little bit of

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:36.920
mind reading a macro. Maybe you can maybe I think that Trump kind of thought one, I don't think

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:40.920
Trump knows much at all about how the government works. I think we probably agree that. I think

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:45.000
Trump probably thought that if he had people that were like at least in his party and kind of camp,

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.040
that they'll basically do whatever needs to be done to give him what he wants and with no respect

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:55.240
for process. But now that he sees it, well, that's it's not enough to just have allies. I need people

01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:59.320
that are fiercely alleged to me. Would we not be worried that a guy that tried to essentially

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.400
steal the election for real wouldn't try to pick people that would be more amenable to his plans

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:06.520
in the next administration? I believe in the checks and balances of American government.

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.680
I believe they worked on January 6th. So if you're asking me, do I think that Trump has bad

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.840
intent or could have bad intent with that sort of stuff? Sure. Do I believe that the

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:22.680
guardrails held and will continue to hold? Also, sure. So you so if somebody was running and they

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:26.520
blatantly said like, I don't want to use the fascist word, but they said, like, I want to

01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:31.080
be an authoritarian, I'm going to abolish all elections, you would say, sure, he's saying that,

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.280
but like, I don't think he can actually do it. So it's okay, if he runs for president, you don't

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.480
care at all as long as you feel like the guardrails. I mean, I might prefer other candidates. But I

01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:41.800
think that also one of the things that you do is that politicians, again, this would be an

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:46.360
exceptional circumstance, but politicians constantly make promises about the things

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.400
that they are going to do and then don't fulfill. And we tend to take those out in the wash, meaning

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:54.360
that, you know, the if I promise that day one, as Donald Trump has pledged to do that he's going to

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:57.640
deport literally every illegal immigrant to the country, do I think he's actually going to do

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.960
that? I mean, I really highly doubt he didn't do it last time he was in office. That's just

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.200
there are many examples of this. I agree. Do I think here's my question, do you think the guardrails

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:11.000
are going to fail to hold? I'm not sure. Really? Yeah, because I think the issue is, is one,

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:16.200
when it's election time, Republicans are spineless in office. And I don't know how many congressmen

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.880
would support what he wants just because they want to win reelection or because I think it's

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:23.400
inevitable anyway. I mean, I think that one of the one of the things that happened in 2022 is

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:26.840
Democrats ran directly on this platform and a bunch of Republicans lost were running on this

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:31.320
platform. Literally every Secretary of State ran on the Donald Trump, we should deny elections

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.640
platform lost in every state. Sure, but other Republicans that have been in office is this.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:39.240
Sure. But I mean, like, look at what happened with like, Kinzinger, Kinzinger and Cheney,

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:44.200
right, who had were very like staunchly anti Trump. After j six, for that select committee,

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:49.000
right, Kinzinger didn't even run again. And Cheney lost her election by I think the widest margin

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.960
that anybody has ever lost an election ever. Like all of us politics were not born voted.

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:57.000
Yeah, I guess it's just it's a surprising position to me for if we're looking at like

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.040
principled stances of government, the idea that a man who has and I think we both agree on this

01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:06.920
that Donald Trump's, Donald Trump's only allegiance is to Donald Trump, right? We agree on that. The

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:09.400
only thing he cares about is Donald Trump. I don't see the only thing care about I think it's

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.600
certainly the largest thing. It's the largest thing he cares about, right? So you've got a man who

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:16.600
only cares about himself, welcome to politics. I mean, it's it may be more, but that's not even

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.960
it may be more with Trump, but it's certainly not unique to Trump. I think that the issue with Trump

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:24.760
too, though, is I think he's even a threat to the Republican Party, in which I think I think you

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:29.160
would mostly agree with me, maybe not overall, but on every individual point, Trump picks bad candidates,

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.920
he has no concern for the future of the Republican Party. Like, for instance, I think there is a

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.200
chance I don't think it'll happen because of the polling looks now. But if Trump didn't get the

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:39.720
nomination, I think Trump would say screw it and run as an independent because he thinks he can

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.280
win or whatever. Right? I doubt that he would do that. But theoretically possible. Yeah, again,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.320
Trump has he was really content to throw Georgia, the two runoff elections under the bus because

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:54.040
Ravensburg is a support him for the election. So what is all this in service of what's the what's

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:58.040
the generalized argument that you're making? Do you believe I'll go back to my question.

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:03.720
If Trump wins, there will be no more elections? Is that is that like what percentage on it? What

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.040
percentage do you think that that's a reality? If Donald Trump wins, I think there is a 100%

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:12.360
chance that he will try to prevent the peaceful transfer of power in terms of would he succeed?

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:15.240
I can guarantee you he will not do that. Why is that? Because he's in the second term and

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.120
he's no longer eligible and he will believe he won and he will leave. Yeah, but hasn't Donald

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:22.360
Trump himself joked about running for a third term? That's I think that having a third term,

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:27.640
what has Donald Trump not joked about? I mean, forgot I don't want Okay, hold on. If you want

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:30.360
to prevent if you want to prevent him from creating a revolution, you probably should

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.880
actually just appoint him president again. Here's another broad argument that I don't like in favor

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:37.400
of Trump. And this was brought up earlier in terms of like, we talked about like, not grading

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:40.760
presidents on a curve. But then earlier, we said we take Biden to read it. Oh, no, I totally great

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.280
from I know I 100% great presidents on a curve. Are you kidding? Oh, okay. I great pretty much

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:47.160
everybody. And I feel like I don't treat my seven year old the same way that I treat my nine year

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:50.840
old. Sure. But I don't like that. It feels like we're treating Donald Trump like a seven year old

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.080
or a nine year old. I think we should treat him like the president United States. I don't

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:56.600
think having a president that has taken like concrete steps to prevent the transfer of power,

01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.720
which he did with the electorate sham, which he did with pence, and what you did with trying

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:04.280
to capitalize on the j six violence, a president has taken concrete steps towards a cooing the

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:08.200
government essentially, I don't know why that guy, we'd say, well, you know, it's Trump, he does

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:12.920
Trump things, the guardrails held will probably hold next. So let me say we shouldn't. Do you mean

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:16.680
that he should be actually barred from office? I'm just talking about support for him. I don't

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:20.120
think Republicans should support should support Trump, you lose your incumbent advantage, the

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:23.960
guy's obviously self destructive, he's destructive, the political party itself, like,

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:29.560
you think he should be on the ballot? You think there's a case to be made to remove them from the

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:36.440
ballot? I think there's a case to be made. But man, the phrasing for as much as our governmental

01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.320
founding fathers, everybody else, you know, wrote nice amendments and wrote nice, the constitution,

01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:46.200
some of the phrasing is very, very, very bad. And the section three, the not requiring any type

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:50.760
of actual conviction. I don't have a strong feeling on it. I will say I'm very interested

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.440
in reading the majority opinion from the Supreme Court. I seriously doubt the Supreme Court is

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:58.120
going to uphold that states should be able to decide if they leave them off the ballot or not.

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:02.920
I think for the political future of the United States, it's probably not healthy that the leading

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.600
opposition candidate is now going to be barred from the ballot is probably not healthy for us.

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:10.760
Because because then what you're talking about threats to democracy, that would be a pretty

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:15.800
serious one applied across the board. It would be however, like that threat to democracy was earned

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.600
by Donald Trump and the conservatives that supported him. I think conservatives made a

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:23.080
dangerous gamble when they threw Trump into office. And now like all of the fallout from that is

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:27.080
something that we all as Americans have to deal with. I mean, I think that the the unprecedented

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:31.800
legal theory that a state can simply bar somebody from the ballot on the basis of in an informal way

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.040
believing that he is quote unquote, an insurrectionist is is pretty wild. I mean,

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:39.240
that's that that is pretty well, but there is an amendment in the Constitution, the 14th

01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:43.640
Amendment that says that if they have engaged in this, they shall not be or you shall I don't

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.840
remember the phrasing because it doesn't require conviction, but it's a self executing arguably

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.960
If we're getting into constitutional law, I mean, they're they're they're a number of

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:53.800
provisions that that suggests that this is number one not self executing minority opinions in the

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:58.360
in the Colorado Supreme Court case are pretty thorough. The the number one contention which

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:03.480
is that this is not self executing, because other elements are not self executing that ignores

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:07.160
subsequent actual law that that happened. I mean, the Congress passed a law, for example,

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.640
in 1872, defining who was an insurrectionist who is not an insurrectionist for purposes of elections.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:15.480
In 1994, Congress passed a law that specifically defined insurrection as a criminal activity so

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.880
that somebody could theoretically be convicted of insurrection and therefore ineligible to run for

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:25.240
office. It is unlike say the the the analogs that are used by the majority opinion like age.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:29.880
Obviously, this is not the same thing. We can all tell what somebody's age is by looking at

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:32.760
their birth certificate. I can't tell whether somebody is an insurrectionist without any

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.960
reference to a legal statute or definition of the term. I would also be careful with that because

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:40.200
remember one of Trump's first like big political actions was challenging Obama's birth certificate.

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:46.760
And I thought that was dumb at the time. I like that you both said 100% chance that Trump will

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:52.440
try to go for third term and 0% chance. He's done, man. Are you kidding? He would want to.

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.960
Trump's going to walk around hands up high and be like, I'm a two term president. I'm the only

01:43:55.960 --> 01:44:00.520
president since Grover Cleveland. But since Grover Cleveland, who served two non consecutive terms,

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.800
I kicked Joe Biden out of office and I kicked Hillary Clinton out of office. Dude would be like,

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.000
he'd be living large. You kidding? He doesn't want the presidency anymore after that. I just

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.520
think that the I think it's scary that like Donald Trump, it feels like for all of the

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:14.920
accusations that are made sometimes against Democrats, like Biden is ordering Garland to

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:19.240
investigate Donald Trump and blah, blah, blah. It seems like Donald Trump would actually do that

01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:25.880
with his DOJ would give them orders. He didn't. He didn't. Well, he kind of did though. Right. So

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:31.720
for instance, with Jeffrey Clark, Jeffrey Clark went to Rosen and Donahue and said, Hey, listen,

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.800
I need you guys to sign off on a letter that we're going to use essentially to bully states into

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.080
overturning their elections by saying we found significant election fraud. And part of that

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:42.600
threat was Jeffrey Clark saying, listen, if you're not going to do it, Rosen, you know,

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.520
Trump's going to fire you and just make me the acting attorney general. That was the threat that

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.520
he carried. And I think Trump repeated that threat in a meeting later on that was I only rebuked when

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.320
I think like half the White House staff said, if you do this, we're resigned. Okay. So that's a

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.600
slightly different topic because now you're getting into all the election shenanigans and all this.

01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:00.680
But I'm saying he threatened to fire his acting attorney general if he wouldn't carry the same

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.280
platform essentially, like if Trump could order his DOJ to do something, would he?

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:09.400
It's not beyond the pale for him, right? It's not beyond the pale for him to order them to do it.

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:11.960
And then it's not beyond the pale for them to reject him doing that, which is the story of his

01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:15.400
entire administration. Whereas Joe Biden orders his DOJ to do things and then they just do them.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:21.800
Well, I'm not we can get into specifics there. I just it is one of the big problems that I have

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.200
with I mean, for example, all the talk about Trump tyrant Trump executive power. I mean,

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:28.840
Joe Biden has used executive power in ways that far outstrip

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:33.080
every president has been stretching and stretching and stretching executive power.

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:37.960
Joe Biden is going like Joe Biden has gone well beyond anything Trump even remotely

01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.800
attempted to maintain via just pure executive power. And actually, Trump's use of executive

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:46.040
power is nowhere near even what Obama's was an ability to get border policy pass literally had

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:50.600
him using executive power to march the military down to the border to do border policy. I mean,

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:56.120
I mean, Joe Biden literally used the occupational safety and hazard administration to try to

01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:01.000
cram down vax mandates on 80 million Americans. That's insane. He literally said I cannot

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.400
relieve student loan debt and then tried to relieve hundreds of billions of dollars.

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:06.440
Yeah, but what happened to that?

01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:10.600
It got struck down by the Supreme Court. And then they still did it. They still did it.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:11.640
Biden brags about it.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:16.040
For for for what he for what he was able to for what he was able to relieve, which I think

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.680
were related to particular type student loan debt. But I'm just saying that like, well,

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:21.640
the guardrails are holding with Biden as much as they're holding with Trump. The only difference

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:25.400
is that once Biden, you know, exhausts his executive power, he's not running around like

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:31.080
lying to people or trying to extort people or trying to concoct insane schemes.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.400
Well, I mean, so here's the way I would think of this. Think of the guardrails holding as

01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:40.040
the filter. Okay, meaning like the the coffee is in the filter. Some of it's, you know, what you

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:42.520
want is going to get through and all the stuff that the guardrails prevent the other stuff

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.480
from getting through. Now the question becomes what liquid are you pouring into the filter?

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:49.800
Okay, meaning so if I'm if the filter exists, if the guardrails hold and if Donald Trump

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:53.320
can't steal elections, what's the policy that comes through the other end of the filter?

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:56.200
The policy I get from Donald Trump on the other end of the filter is a bunch of stuff that I like.

01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.600
The policy that I get from Joe Biden on the other end of the filter is a bunch of

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:03.720
bullshit I don't. So that's the basic calculation. Okay, so so then the idea is essentially that

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.440
Donald Trump's rhetoric is insane, but we don't care. Donald Trump would probably try to

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:11.800
steal an election if he could, but he probably won't be able to. He's not gonna do it again.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:17.160
I told you he's not. You don't you don't think he has any. Why not? Because he won't be eligible

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.600
to be on the ballot in. I mean, by the way, you want to talk about 14th Amendment? That's

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.080
where the 14th Amendment applies. Okay, that's where it actually applies. Meaning you cannot,

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.400
he is not qualified to be on the ballot in 2028 if he is the president of the United States.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.960
States can literally, in self-executing fashion, take him off the ballot. Just like he's past the

01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:38.120
age of 35. Once you have been president two times, you're no longer eligible to be president of the

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:43.000
United States. Then you actually have a strong location to keep him off the ballot. Why would

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.040
the 14th Amendment stop if he thought Vice President Pence could unilaterally decide the

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.560
outcome of the election? When he's not on the ballot? So now your theory is that he's gonna get

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.240
he's gonna get reelected. And then in 2028, he's not even gonna be on the ballot. And he's gonna

01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:59.720
direct his new vice president, Kerry Lake, to simply declare him president of the United States

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.960
when he has not been on a ballot. I don't know what the I don't know what the scheme would be.

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:07.480
I think we can kind of like laugh and say there's no scheme we could even concoct.

01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:12.520
But I think with the machine gun, he's gonna walk. I think the issue, though, is that like the idea

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:16.440
of electing another president that has tried to circumvent the peaceful transfer power using

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:20.760
extra legal means, and then pretending like we can't concoct a single scheme that he could try

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:26.840
to circumvent other legal processes to have a third term or to have a longer term or to install

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:30.440
who he wants as the next president. I just want to when a person has already shown you who they are,

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:34.440
and with every single person around him agrees with that, when every single person that's worked

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:39.480
with him save for the what Sidney Powell, Eastman and Giuliani, which I don't think even I don't

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:43.240
think anybody would want to throw their lot in with those three. It just seems wild to me that

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:46.520
we would say like, yeah, we're just gonna go ahead and trust this guy with another term of president,

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:49.960
but like he can't run for a third term. So it's fine when there's like 50 million other things.

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.200
And I'll make you the case that if you want him not to make election trouble,

01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.560
you should elect him president in the next election cycle, and then he will be ineligible.

01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:59.480
Okay. Well, I find that to be a wholly unconvincing argument.

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:08.280
Well, recently in the news, the presidents of Harvard, Penn and MIT failed to fully denounce

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:15.400
calls for genocide. And that rose questions about the influence of DEI programs at universities.

01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:21.960
And so maybe either looking at this or zooming out more broadly at identity politics at universities

01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:28.600
or identity politics, woke ism in our culture. How big of a threat is it to our culture to

01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:32.760
Western civilization? So obviously, I'm gonna say it's a huge threat. The reason that I think

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.440
there's a huge threat, I want to give a definition of woke ism because people are very often accused

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:40.200
of not using woke ism properly or believing that it's sort of a catch all phrase. I don't think

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:46.440
it's a catch all term. I think that woke ism has its roots in postmodernism, which essentially

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:54.440
suggests that every principle is a reflection of underlying structures of power. And that therefore,

01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:01.000
any inequality that emerges under such a system is a reflection, again, of that structure of power

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.760
that used to be applied in sort of Marxist ways, the suggestion being that economic inequality

01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:11.480
was the result of misallocation of power in the structure preserved by an upper crust of people

01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:15.800
who wanted to cram down exploitation on people that was sort of the Marxist version of postmodernism.

01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:20.200
And that got transmuted into sort of a racial version of postmodernism in which the systems

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:25.480
of the United States are white supremacist in orientation, and are perpetuated by a group of

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:31.560
people who are in fact, in favor of the preservation of white power and white supremacy. That is the

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:37.240
generalized theory of critical race theory, as proposed by, for example, Jean Stefanczyk and

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:43.960
Richard Delgado in their book on critical race theory. That has taken a softer form that we

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:50.280
refer to as DEI. The key in DEI is the E, meaning equity. So equity is a term that does not mean

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:55.400
equality. People mix it up. Equality is the idea that we all ought to have equal rights, that we

01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:00.600
all ought to be treated equally by the law. Equity is the idea that if there is an inequality that

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:04.600
emerges from any system, it is therefore due to discrimination. And the best way to tell whether

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:09.480
somebody has been victimized is by dint of their race. And we can tell whether you're a member of

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:15.240
an oppressed group or an oppressor group by the intersectional identity that you carry,

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:20.600
and by the nature of your group's success or failure, predominantly along economic and power

01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:26.280
lines in American life. This means that if one group is predominantly successful economically,

01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:30.920
they must be a member of the victimizing class. And the only corrective for that would be,

01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:36.280
as Ibram X. Kennedy likes to suggest, effectively anti-racist policies, racism in the service of

01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:42.200
destroying racism, that you're going to have to discriminate on the basis of race in order to

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:47.160
correct for discrimination that's baked into the system. That's incredibly dangerous. It leads to

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.240
a victim-victimizer narrative that is unhealthy for individuals and terrible for societies.

01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:57.640
It relieves people of individual responsibility, and it destroys the very notion of an objective

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:01.720
metric by which we can decide meritocracy. And meritocracy is the only system human beings

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:06.840
have ever devised that has positive externalities in literally any area of life. Every other

01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:12.920
distribution of wealth, power, done along other lines that is not having to do with merit has

01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:16.760
negative externalities. Every system having to do with merit has positive externalities because

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:20.360
presumably the most effective and useful people are going to succeed under those systems. That's

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:24.760
the very basis of a meritocracy. And those externalities of that mean that other people

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:29.480
benefit from the meritorious and excellent performance of those people. Maybe you'd be

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:33.800
good to get your comments. You're all stomping ground Harvard. Do you think the president of

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.040
Harvard should have been fired? I mean, I think she should have been fired out over the plagiarism

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:42.440
allegations. I think she should have been fired based on her performance just at that congressional

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:50.760
hearing. If the word black had been substituted for Jew in that statement by Elise Stefanik that

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:54.600
she was asking about or trans or literally any other any other minority in America,

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:58.680
maybe with the exception of Asian, then the answer would have been very different coming from cloudy

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:02.520
and gay. With that said, I don't think the firing of cloud and gay really accomplishes very much.

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:08.680
I mean, did she get what she deserved? Sure. Does that mean that the underlying DEI equity based

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:13.960
system has been in any way severely damaged? No, I think that this is a way for universities,

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:20.120
as truthful as McGillip Penn also, to basically throw somebody overboard as the sacrifice to

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.800
maintain the underlying system that continues to predominate at American universities where

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:28.440
they spend literally billions of dollars every year on DEI initiatives and diversity hires and

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:32.920
diversity administrators and all of this. I mean, one of the cost of education escalating

01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:37.640
is in the massive administrative function that is now undertaken by universities

01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:44.520
as opposed to TJing and cost of dorms and such. You guys probably agree on a lot of this, right?

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:51.960
Kind of, maybe, yeah. I don't know what makes things do this, but it feels like we can never

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:56.600
have a good thing and then have it end as a good thing. Things always get taken to their

01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:02.920
extreme and then we have to fight on those extremes. I would argue that back in my day,

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:07.480
we called it SJW, social justice warriors, before it became woke. It was like 2013 onwards,

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:12.360
whatever. There are aspects to wokeism that I think are good. I like the additional representation

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:15.880
that we have in media now. I like how as much as people complain about the internet and how it's

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.480
regulated, that there are way more groups that are represented on the internet, whether we're talking

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:25.160
the platform formerly known as Twitter or Facebook or whatever. I think in some ways,

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:30.040
or whether we're pushing women's achievements in school and in the wider workforce, I think that

01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:35.400
these are all good things. The issue that you run into is people don't ever have a stopping point

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:40.360
and I think people kind of get lost in this woke for woke sake thing where we start to see these

01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:47.160
very weird warping of these academic arguments that are used for really horrible things.

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:52.280
For instance, I think that you can talk about in the United States things like white supremacy

01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:57.000
or things like oppression or certain demographics, especially with Jim Crow laws and pre-Jim Crow.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.200
And you can even talk about effects from that. But then when you run into this weird world where

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:03.960
we've kind of warped these things so that not only is white supremacy still as present today

01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:08.040
as it ever has been, well actually, black people and other minorities can't even be racist. They

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:11.560
don't have the power to because we're going to use a different definition of racism and we can only

01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:15.160
talk about punching up as opposed to punching down. And then we're actually going to say it's

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:18.440
totally okay for these people to say or do whatever they want and it's never bad. But

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.800
white people who have always been the oppressors, even if you're a trailer park guy whose family's

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.320
addicted to meth, you have all this privilege, et cetera, et cetera. I think that you run into

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:29.400
these issues where it starts off as like a really good idea. And I would argue has achieved really

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:33.160
good things, especially in regards to like women's education, everything. And then it just gets so

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:37.240
academicized. There's a word there, academic, whatever, where you take something and you put

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:41.400
it into school too much. And then it comes out as some Frankenstein cancer baby of like horrible

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.560
things such that today when I'm reading stuff, and I know Ben is the same way, like if I even

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:49.720
hear somebody say the word like anti-racism, I'm probably ignoring every other thing you have to

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:54.120
say. If you utter the word like colonial anything, I'm probably going to say you probably don't have

01:55:54.120 --> 01:56:01.080
anything good to say. Yeah, a lot of it has just taken way too far. But you know what I will blame

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:05.240
on some of this is I will blame conservatives for some of this, because I think one issue that

01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:09.720
happens, and I think Ben might even agree with me here too, is I think there's two huge problems

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:14.120
that have happened in the United States, I think broadly speaking, is that one, we become more

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:18.360
different than we ever have been. And two, we become more similar than we ever have been.

01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:22.040
And when I say this, what I mean is that like we're splitting off into these groups and then these

01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:26.680
groups are enforcing this insane homogeneity between these two separate groups. And I think

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.080
one of these schisms has been conservatives' reluctancy to participate in things related to

01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:35.640
higher education. So for a long time, conservatives are saying like, oh, you know, the educational

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.760
institutions are against us, you know, Rush Limbaugh talks about how evil the colleges

01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:41.960
are and blah, blah, blah. And then what happens is as conservatives are less and less willing

01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:46.520
to engage in them. So then you get this scenario or this environment where everybody that's engaged

01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:54.200
in academia on the administrative side are fucking insane. They're like even more so too,

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:57.720
and I also want to draw a distinction between like the administrators and the faculty because

01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:01.400
oftentimes when you're reading story after story after story of like all of these insane admins

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:05.320
that are pushing further and further left, usually the faculty is fighting against it. A lot of the

01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:08.120
tenured professors, a lot of people in their departments are saying like, hold on, well,

01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.080
we actually don't agree with this. But I feel like because conservatives for so long have demonized

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:18.680
these institutions rather than like critically evaluated them and tried to like have like honest

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:22.680
critique and engagement that they've just like completely broken off. And when you only have a

01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:27.240
bunch of lefties or righties together, all they'll do is they're veer off like even more into their

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:31.080
insane directions. I feel like that's a big problem that we run into in the country to where

01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:34.680
conservatives have totally broken off some conversations broken away from where they

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:38.440
won't participate in them anymore. And then the people that you have left just run as far to the

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:41.800
left as possible. Certainly, when you look at certain institutions, I think that one of the

01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:45.800
things that people on both sides of the aisle are constantly looking at is, has the institution

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.360
suffered such capture that there is just no capacity to fix it? And when you talk about the

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:54.040
universities, I'm not going to blame conservatives for the failure of the universities because they

01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:59.000
haven't been present in major positions at universities since effectively the late 1960s.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:04.520
You can go read Shelby Steele's work on this where he talks about how, you know, he used to be he's

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:09.400
now a conservative black person. He was a liberal black person at the time. He was actually quite a

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:14.680
radical black activist at the time in the 60s. And he talks about walking into the office of

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:20.120
liberal administrators who are largely on his side with regard to civil rights. And being a radical,

01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:23.800
him claiming that the systems of the university were inherently broken, were inherently wrong,

01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:28.040
unfixable. And he talks about this very it's a very evocative episode where he's talking about

01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:33.320
how he's smoking. And as he's smoking, the ash is growing more and more. And the ash falls down

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:38.040
on this very expensive carpet. And the president of the university who's listening to him rant and

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:42.040
rave, he said, Shelby Steele says, I thought he was going to say something about this. I mean,

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.600
I was wrecking like a thousand dollar carpet in his office being a jackass. And instead,

01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:50.040
I could see him wilt inside. I could see him collapse. He didn't have the institutional

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:54.920
credibility or the intellect or sort of the spiritual strength to just say, listen,

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:58.440
I agree with you on some of these things, but you're acting like a jackass. And what you see

01:58:58.440 --> 01:59:03.240
in the late 1960s and early 1970s is in fact the collapse of these institutions to the point where

01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:07.320
by the time I was going to college, there was this radical disproportion between conservatives

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:10.360
and liberals. And the problem is that when it comes to a system like the universities,

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:14.360
basically have to separate the universities off into two separate categories. One is STEM,

01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:18.040
where the universities are still pretty damn good. American universities, when it comes to STEM,

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:22.440
are still leading universities in the world. Harvard's main creations these days are coming

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:27.480
from actual hard science fields. Then you have the liberal arts field in which you basically

01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:31.400
have a self perpetuating elite because that's actually how dissertations work. If you have

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:34.040
somebody who's very far to the left and you decide that you're going to write a dissertation on the

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:37.640
history of American gun rights, the chances that that is going to be approved by your dissertation

01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:41.080
advisor are much lower than if you happen to write something that tends to agree with the

01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:45.720
political positions of your dissertation advisor. Now, listen, I think there are open and tolerant

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:48.840
professors even in the liberal arts at these universities. I went to these universities,

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:51.960
I went to UCLA, I went to Harvard Law School. When I was at Harvard Law School, one of my favorite

01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:56.120
professors was Lani Guinier. Lani Guinier, they tried to appoint her, I believe, secretary of

01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:59.960
labor under Clinton, and she was too liberal and she got rejected. So she was like a full on

01:59:59.960 --> 02:00:03.480
communist. By the time I went there, she was great. We had debates every day. It was wonderful. She

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:07.880
used to write me recommendations for my legal jobs after we left. Randall Kennedy, I don't agree

02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:11.560
with him very much. Randall Kennedy was a terrific professor. There are some professors who are like

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:17.640
this. Unfortunately, there tends to be in these echo chambers more and more ideological conformity

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:22.520
that is rigorously enforced and it is by left on left. So for example, when I was at Harvard

02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:25.560
Law School, the president of the university was another president who ended up being ousted,

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:29.880
Larry Summers. Larry Summers had been the secretary of treasury under Bill Clinton and he made the

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:34.200
critical error of suggesting that perhaps the dearth of women in hard sciences in prestigious

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:38.760
positions was due to possibly two factors that people were refusing to talk about.

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:43.640
One was the possibility that women actually didn't want to be in hard sciences at nearly the rates

02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:49.640
that men do, which happens to be true. And two was the distribution of STEM IQ, which is something

02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:53.560
that you certainly were not allowed to talk about. The idea that the men's bell curve when it comes

02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:57.000
to IQ, particularly on STEM subjects, tends to be shallower than the women's bell curve. So when

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.200
you get to the very end of the bell curve, what you tend to see is a lot of really dumb guys and

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:03.560
a lot of really smart guys. And so when you're talking about the top universities, maybe that

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:07.960
has something to do with the disproportion. And he's trying to explain that to say that our systems

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:10.920
are not discriminating. If we end up with more men than women, maybe more men are applying and more

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:16.200
men are qualified. That's, that's why he was ousted for that by a left-wing faculty and,

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:21.320
and, you know, general alum network at, at Harvard University. There's a lot to blame

02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:24.440
conservatives for, for surrendering the playing field. I totally agree that conservatives should

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:28.200
not have surrendered the playing field in some institutions. Colleges were surrendered a lot

02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:32.440
earlier than 20 years ago. They were surrendered in the late 1960s, early 1970s. Yeah. So I think

02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:37.640
that a couple things. So one of the big issues that I have with kind of like this, I don't know

02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:43.160
if we call it error of Trumpism or populism is this total disregard for institutions and this

02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:46.600
disconnect from participation in the system. So it's one of the big things that I felt with

02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:49.960
progressives about who, who cares? Cause they're all 20 years old. They don't vote anyway. But

02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:54.760
it's another thing that I noticed with a lot of people that are Trump voters, Trump fans or

02:01:54.760 --> 02:02:00.360
whatever, is this idea where we say this institution is irrevocably destroyed. It's

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:05.320
irredeemable. It can't be saved. It can't, nothing that we do can, can fix it. And I think that what

02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:09.800
that leads people to doing is one, they disconnect further. And then two, there's a general

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:14.280
hopelessness when it comes to how society is like ran or structured such that you fall into that

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:18.360
populist brain rot of the only person that can save me is Donald Trump. I can't trust literally

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.920
anything. And I think that when you start driving people into that direction, all it does is it

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:27.160
further amplifies all the problems that you're complaining about. So that's one of the reasons

02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:30.360
why when we talk about like conservative participation, I want there to be more

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:34.120
conservatives that are trying to participate in academia. But I feel like the leading thought

02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.480
or the leading speaking out against it is basically saying it's a waste of time. It's

02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:41.480
completely lost. So I think that the alternative to that is that you are seeing on the right

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.080
a growth of, for example, alternative universities. Yeah, but that's the worst thing.

02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:49.080
No, I don't think so at all. I think competition is a great way of incentivizing some change on

02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:53.000
on behalf of universities that may have forgotten that there's an entire another side of the aisle

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.840
in the United States. No, no shot. I don't believe even I don't think even you think that.

02:02:56.840 --> 02:03:00.520
So first of all, first of all, let me make clear, I think the entire educational system at the upper

02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:03.240
levels, if you're not in STEM is a complete scam. I think it's a complete waste of money. I think

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:07.080
it's a complete waste of time. And I think that it's all it is, is a formalized, very expensive

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.720
sorting mechanism for people of IQ. That's all it is. People take an SAT, you go to a good school,

02:03:11.720 --> 02:03:16.600
you take four years of bullshit. I know I did it UCLA. And then we analyze based on your degree,

02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:20.680
where you should go to law school, I could have gone directly from high school to law school with

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:24.440
maybe one year of training and then done one year of law school and been done. Okay, the reality is

02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:29.160
that this is a giant scam. And this again, it's a bipartisan problem. But it's just a generalized

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:33.800
problem. We have, you want to talk about things that hurt the lower classes in the United States,

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.600
the bleeding of degrees up is so wild and crazy. There's so many jobs in the United States that

02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:41.960
should not require a college degree that we now require a college degree to do because there was

02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:46.520
this weird idea that came over Americans where they mistook correlation for causation. They would

02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:49.560
say, Oh, look, people who go to college are making more money than people who don't go to college.

02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:54.360
Therefore, everyone should go to college. Well, maybe the reason is because people who are going

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:58.680
to college were better qualified for particular jobs because on average, not all the time,

02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:02.280
but on average, a lot of those people were smarter and making more money because of that. And so all

02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:06.200
you've done is you've now created these additional layers of stratification. So a person who used to

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:09.400
be able to get a job with a college degree now has to have a postdoc degree in order to go get

02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:13.240
that degree. A person who used to be able to just graduate high school. Now it's the fact that you

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:17.000
got to go to JuCo and then you got to go to college or nobody's going to look at your resume. It's

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.320
really, really terrible for people who can't afford all of that. It's led to this massive increase in

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:26.680
educational cost that is inexplicable other than this particular sort of bleed up. And by the way,

02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:30.600
federal subsidies for higher education. Again, one of my problems with federal subsidies for

02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:35.080
higher education, I'd love for everyone to be able to go to college if qualified to do so. And if it

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.000
is productive. But one of the things I did when I went to law school is I took loans because a bank

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.760
said I was going to get my money back if I got a law degree from Harvard. But you know when you're

02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:46.040
not going to get your money back, if you're a bank, you're not going to lend to some dude who wants

02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:51.480
to major in art theory because is that a good bet? There's no collateral. If I give a loan for a

02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:55.000
house, I can go repossess the house. How do I repossess your garbage college degree from UCLA?

02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:00.920
There's no way to do that. So this is a broader conversation about education in general. I think

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:04.680
the educational system is cruising for a bruising. And I think all that's necessary for it to

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:10.200
completely collapse on the non-STEM side where you actually learn things is for people who employ

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:14.120
to simply say, give me your SAT score and I will hire you for an apprenticeship directly out of

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:17.960
high school. That it would cut out so much of the middleman. But as far as the general point that

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:24.200
you're making about institutions, I may disagree on the education and how far it's gone. In general,

02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:30.120
I agree with you. So in general, I agree. And I get to use my favorite longest word in the English

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:34.280
language here. I would consider myself in many cases an anti-disestablishmentarianist.

02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:37.880
Nice. You see that? I like to drop that. Because if you're an establishmentarian,

02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:42.280
that means you like establishmentarianism. Can you say that word, Dustin?

02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:44.600
That's the one we all learned growing up, anti-disestablishmentarianism.

02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:48.840
There you go. So he is also. And then some candidate group would say,

02:05:48.840 --> 02:05:51.720
what about supercalifragilisticexp? And then you're like, what about new ultramecroscopics?

02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:56.600
Yeah, or the science terms. Or what about the 7,000 letter thing that's from part of biochemistry?

02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:59.560
I got my education in the Soviet Union. So we just did math.

02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:03.320
That's why you're a useful person. Soviet Union math was that one plus one,

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:06.520
how to make that equal three? We know long words. And he streams on the internet.

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:13.720
And I talk for a living. So anyway, but the point is that I don't disagree that there is

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:17.720
a general populist tendency on all sides of the aisle to look at the institutions and then throw

02:06:17.720 --> 02:06:22.520
them overboard. I think that some of that is earned by people who are in positions of power

02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:27.320
at institutions who have completely undermined the faith and credibility of those institutions.

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:30.520
I think that you have to examine institution by institutions, which ones are salvageable

02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:33.880
and which ones are not. So I'm not a full anti-disestablishmentarianism.

02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:37.720
I'd be partially in that camp. There are certain institutions like higher education

02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:41.080
in the liberal arts that I think we may be better off without. And then there are certain

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:44.760
institutions, like say participation in American government, where when people talk about we need

02:06:44.760 --> 02:06:48.920
a revolution, like, no, we don't. That's not a thing. We need an evolution. We need change.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:55.000
We can use the system. But I think you have to look at it industry by industry,

02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:59.000
institution by institution. On that position of institutions,

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.440
do you think Biden or Trump would salvage you more?

02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:02.600
As far as the institutions? Yeah.

02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:05.720
I think the institutions in the United States at the governmental level are robust. I think the

02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:07.480
social institutions are fair. Yeah, but I'm just curious on your

02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:10.680
general view of institutions. Do you think Biden or Trump would salvage you more on how you view

02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:15.720
them? I think that in rhetoric, Biden would. And then I think that he would tear out the face of

02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:19.560
the institution and wear it around like a mask like Hannibal Lecter. Even though he resisted

02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:24.840
some people's calls to pack the court? Yes, because I think that his use of executive power

02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:29.240
was greater than that of Donald Trump. The power that he had, he used to greater effect

02:07:29.240 --> 02:07:32.200
than Donald Trump. Donald Trump, again, thrashed up against the sides of the box,

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:36.680
but could not get out of it. Okay. Just real quick, because that answer

02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:40.600
went a lot farther than the initial question. Yeah, just on the real quick thing, the reason why,

02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:43.960
again, my main problem that I feel like we have today in society is people are getting into their

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:47.720
own bubbles. The idea of having conservative schools and liberal schools seems like the saddest

02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:52.120
thing in the world to me. I would want conservatives and liberals going to school together because I

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:55.080
think these people need to interact with each other more, if for no other reason than to say

02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:59.880
that the other person is not an actual monstrous, horrible entity that wants to destroy the country.

02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:02.760
I think a classically liberal idea for many schools would not be a bad thing. I think it

02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:05.720
would be a good thing. You just wonder if that's salvageable. And if it's not salvageable,

02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:09.480
then the answer to that is to actually create alternative institutions. I feel like the biggest

02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:14.200
issue that we have is people are, they sort into these different like phantom worlds to where,

02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:17.080
even if you live in the same city, there are totally different worlds that exist between

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:19.880
liberals and conservatives. And I feel like one of the big barriers to people understanding the

02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:24.120
other side, sometimes it's just a little bit of information or a little bit of like firsthand

02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:29.880
experience. So in terms of information, I'm sure you saw, I don't know if this is a full-on study,

02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:33.320
but they were talking about how some huge percentage of students would change their

02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:37.720
mind on from the river to the sea. When you told them what the river was and what the sea was.

02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:41.240
Or when you said like, yeah, what does a one-state solution mean? A lot of them,

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:45.480
such that the numbers went from like 70% to like 30% in terms of like support would fall. And it

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:48.360
wasn't because you were doing a radical redefining their whole ideology. You're just giving them a

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:51.960
little bit more information. And then something that I've seen on a firsthand level is when I go

02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:55.400
and speak or do debates at universities, sometimes I'm in very, very, very conservative areas. Some

02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.080
of my fans are trans. Having like a trans person show up and talk to conservatives for a little

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:03.000
bit, not like in a speech, but just like in like a bar or setting, like a lot of them walk away

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.360
thinking like, oh, not every trans person is like this insane lunatic from Twitter that is

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.280
fucking an actual crazy person. And then for some of my fans, when they hang out with conservatives,

02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:12.840
like, oh, these guys are actually pretty friendly. I thought they would have all been homophobic,

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:15.800
racist, transphobic and evil, but they're not. They're just like normal people. I feel like we

02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:18.760
need more of that. I totally agree with that. Certainly. Yeah. And I feel like on our social

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:22.200
media platforms, on our algorithms, in our schools, I feel like we're sorting harder and harder and

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:27.160
harder. And any type of rhetoric that encourages the sorting is really bad and damaging. We need

02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:30.600
to like continue to mix up. And there's other things I want to talk about, but Alexis opening

02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:40.040
his mouth. Wow. As we approach the end, let us descend into the meme further and further.

02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:46.360
Ben, you're in a monogamous marriage. Destiny, you've been mostly in an open marriage until

02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:53.400
recently. How foundational is marriage, monogamous marriage to the United States of America? Can open

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:59.800
marriages work? Are they harmful to society? Ben? Marriages are the single most important thing that

02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:03.640
people can do in the United States because the things within your control are easier to control

02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:07.800
than things outside your control. People tend to think about big political change, obviously,

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.240
about things they can do to change the entire system. But the reality is the thing that you

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:15.480
can do that best changes society is to get married and have kids and raise your kids responsibly.

02:10:15.480 --> 02:10:19.240
That is the single best thing that you can do. Can an open marriage work? I mean, I think that

02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:23.880
it depends on your definition of work. So in my version of work, the answer is no, because what

02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:29.000
you actually need in order to facilitate the healthy growing of a child is a father and mother

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.040
who are committed to each other. All ideas about there being no emotional component to

02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.800
sexual activity are completely specious. That is true for men than it is for women,

02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:47.240
but it's not true for either. The idea of a full commitment to a human being with whom you

02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:52.280
genetically create children, which is typically how we've done it throughout human existence,

02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:56.440
is in fact the fundamental basis for any functional civilization. It allows for the

02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:00.360
transmission of culture and values. It allows for the transmission of beliefs and responsibility.

02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:05.480
It gives the great lie to both the communitarian lie and the

02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:11.560
atomistic individualist lie. The communitarian lie is that you belong to the giant community of man,

02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:16.680
which is not true because you have a family, and your allegiance should be and is, naturally,

02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:20.680
to the members of your family first. That's how we learn, and then we expound that out.

02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.000
It also is a lie to the notion that we are all atomistic individuals with no

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.160
responsibilities. We are born into a world of responsibilities. Everyone is born into a world

02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:34.840
of responsibilities and rules and roles, and those are good. If we do not actually socialize

02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:39.720
our children that way, there will be, number one, no children. Number two, there will be no healthy

02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:44.760
children. Number three, there will be not the foundation for either social fabric, which is

02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:51.560
the real glue that holds together society, or for a functional government. Yes, monogamous marriage.

02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.160
I'm a fan. 15 years married, four kids. Yes.

02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:55.960
Destiny, what do you think?

02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:58.600
I think that when we talk about relationships or marriage,

02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:01.560
I think something that's really important is we have to talk about whether or not children are

02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:06.440
being discussed or not. Because I think once you introduce the child aspect, I think the style or

02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.120
the type of relationship that you do is going to become way more important than whatever exists

02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:15.240
prior to that. I would agree, for instance, in terms of what Ben is saying, that there's probably

02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:20.280
going to be some structure that is ideal for the care and the raising of a child. I think that

02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:24.360
having a child gives you a much bigger buy-in to society, because now all of a sudden you care

02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:27.640
about a lot of things that you might not have before, because not only do you exist in society,

02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:31.000
you can't just run. Now you've got a child that exists there, and you've got to ensure that

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.480
everything functions smoothly, not just for you, but for that child as well.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:39.160
Arguably, although we're getting into weird places, I guess, in the world now,

02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:43.800
children are the primary conduit for where you transmit cultural values and everything.

02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:48.440
The one kind of weird thing that we're coming up against, that we have been coming up against

02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:54.120
now for some number of decades and will continue to, is as societies progress,

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:59.000
it seems like people are having less children, and I actually don't know 100% what the answer

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.360
is to that question. I do. Yeah, I'm sure you do. I mean, an implementable answer that works,

02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:08.920
that we know we can get everybody on board with. It seems like, for a large part of human history,

02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:13.240
having children, and it still is, having children is awesome, and children are cool,

02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:17.480
and children are magical and miraculous and all of this, but you didn't really have much competing

02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:21.560
for your attention to have a child, right? When you hit a certain age and you started working,

02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:26.120
especially if you're a woman, I mean, childbirth is kind of the next step, and then having a family

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:29.720
raising your children and then doing that is kind of the next step. Nowadays, especially with women

02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:33.080
being able to work, especially women having access to birth control, there's a lot available in the

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:37.160
world that's competing for the interest of people that could otherwise be having children, such that

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:40.520
we've almost flipped it, such that has been brought up earlier, like wealthy people tend

02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:44.440
to have less children than not wealthy people, or unless you're part of particular religious

02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:50.600
communities that push childbirth a lot. I don't know if I would say there exists a moral imperative

02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:54.760
on an individual to have children. I think that there's a lot of interesting arguments down that

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:58.520
path. I don't know if we're quite at the point yet where we need to say like, oh my God, we're

02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:02.760
running out of people. We need to have more kids. I don't think we're quite there yet, but we are

02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:07.160
seeing weird demographic trends that are having big impacts on how countries are playing out.

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:10.200
For instance, the fact that we have a disproportionately huge aging population

02:14:10.200 --> 02:14:13.080
that needs to be taken care of with medical expenses and everything, that vote in different

02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:16.680
ways than our younger population, and that when they die off, like the way that society is going

02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:21.000
to look is going to be a lot different. Yeah, I don't actually have a, I'm not entirely sure

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.160
what the future is going to look like in terms of pushing people to have kids when every single

02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:28.680
industrialized country, as they become more industrialized, have fewer and fewer and fewer

02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:33.800
children. Rapid fire questions. By the answer, my answer was? Go to church. Religion, yeah.

02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:39.560
Well, we could talk about religion, but that's not rapid fire at all. Let me ask,

02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:45.960
this is from the internet. Does body count matter? Jesus Christ. You're really bringing

02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:50.440
up the red pill stuff. Are you avoiding answering? I mean, it's totally, it depends on who you are.

02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:52.680
If you're somebody that doesn't care about it, it doesn't. If you're somebody that does care

02:14:52.680 --> 02:14:58.680
about it, yeah, it does, of course. Depends on the answer is yes. Okay. Should porn be banned? No.

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:08.920
If you could do it, yes. There is no benefit to pornography. It's a waste of time and

02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:13.400
destructive to the human soul. I can't believe I'm asking this question. Is OnlyFans empowering

02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:20.600
or destructive for women? Jesus, these are rapid fire? Yeah, just you can't. I mean,

02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:23.080
it's probably empowering for the ones that are making a lot of money off it. It probably feels

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:26.520
disempowering for others that feel affected by the cultural norms set by women that do OnlyFans.

02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:30.680
There's my rapid fire answer. It's destructive to even the ones who are making a lot of money,

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:35.400
because when you degrade yourself to being just a set of human body characteristics that other

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:41.880
people jack off to, it's bad for you and it's bad for them. Is rap music? Absolutely. Have you

02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:47.560
evolved on this? Have I evolved on this? So, again, I'm going to go to what's the definition

02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:51.960
of music. My original argument about rap was that music involves the following three elements,

02:15:51.960 --> 02:16:00.200
rhythm, melody, harmony. Rap typically involves maybe one of those. There may be a melody,

02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:06.440
maybe sometimes. So it depends on the kind of rap. With that said, I could be convinced on this

02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:12.440
issue, but listen, I'm a classical violinist. I mean, that's how I was raised. I listen to

02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:17.640
Beethoven and Brahms and Mozart, like in the car with my kids. So is it comparable? Is it in the

02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:21.400
same category as Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart? I have a very hard time sticking it in the same

02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:30.040
category as that. All right. You're both world-class debaters, even public intellectuals

02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.400
if I can say that. Jesus. I'm going real hard here. I know. You both care about the truth.

02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:43.880
What is your process of arriving at the truth? I think it's really important to everybody will

02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:47.720
say that they're objective and that they are nonpartisan. I think it's really important to

02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:54.920
have mental safeguards for bad opinions. So for instance, like a couple of things that I'll ask

02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:58.920
myself is for a particular debate that I'm having, like, can I argue convincingly both sides of the

02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:02.120
debate? If I can't, I won't bother having the debate because I realize that I'm probably too

02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:07.240
partisanly dug in if I can't even represent like an opposite argument here. Another question that

02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.280
you might ask yourself is like, well, what would it take to convince you out of a certain position?

02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:17.000
If you feel very strongly that Medicare for all is a good system by which to run the United

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.640
States healthcare, and somebody says, well, what would it take you to convince you otherwise? If

02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:22.120
you can't even fathom, like, well, what would it take to convince me otherwise? You're probably

02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:27.080
too dug into a position. So I think if you go through life saying like, well, I try my best to

02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:32.760
be unbiased, rather than saying, I try to best my best be aware of my biases, because the latter

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.600
is more realistic in the former is literally impossible unless you're a computer. Yeah. So

02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:42.280
I think having like actual mental practices that you engage in to try to counter some of the biases

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:45.560
that you have is more important than trying to pretend that you're free of all biases,

02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:50.600
and then consuming all your media from one source. Ben? So, I mean, I agree with a lot of that. I

02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:54.520
think that the easiest practical guide is read a bunch of different things from a bunch of different

02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:59.960
sources and where they cross is probably the set of facts. And then everything else is extrapolated

02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:05.560
opinion from different premises. That's the that's sort of the short story. So read the New York

02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:09.880
Times and Breitbart, and they're going to disagree on a lot. But if the core of the daily wire,

02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:13.880
certainly read the daily wire. If you read the daily wire, and you read the Washington Post,

02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:19.400
and there's a and there's a nexus of the same thing, then you can pretty well guarantee that

02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:23.560
at least, you know, if it's if we're all blind men feeling the elephant, at least if we're all

02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:26.280
feeling the trunk, we know that there's a trunk there, right? You may not know what the elephant

02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:32.360
is. And if you're feeling frisky, then watch Destiny as well. Thanks. You've talked about,

02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:38.600
you know, having a conversation debating Ben for a long time. What is your favorite thing about

02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:44.360
Ben Shapiro? My favorite thing about Ben Shapiro is, at least when we're in election season,

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:50.200
he's very critical of his own party. I appreciate that. That doesn't I feel like Ben generally

02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.600
tries to adhere more to the fact based arguments than other conservatives that I listen to,

02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:58.280
which is something that I appreciate because it's more fun to fight on kind of like the factual

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:02.360
grounds of discussing things like foreign policy or whatever, rather than people that only inhabit

02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:05.880
the idealistic or philosophical grounds because they don't want to learn about any of the facts.

02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:10.600
So I appreciate that. Ben, you've gotten a chance to talk to Destiny now. What do you like about the

02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:15.400
guy? A lot of the same sorts of things, but it's really fun to see how you do your process. That

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:19.320
is a cool thing. That is a cool thing. And it's a gift to the audience because honestly, doing what

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:23.400
we do, so much of what we do is sitting and reading and being behind closed doors and educating

02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:27.160
yourself and talking with people. But getting to watch you do it in real time is a really cool

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:30.680
window into how people think and how people learn. So that's a really neat thing. Well,

02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:34.440
gentlemen, this was incredible. It's an honor. Thank you for doing this today.

02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:35.560
Thanks a lot. Thanks for having me.

02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:41.160
Thanks for listening to this debate between Ben Shapiro and Destiny. To support this podcast,

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:51.400
Aristotle. The basis of a democratic state is liberty.

02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:55.400
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
