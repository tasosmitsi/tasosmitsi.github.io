WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
That's all that matters, that he got there,

00:02.200 --> 00:04.600
that he got to the place to act like a fighter,

00:04.600 --> 00:08.480
to do what we want him to do, to be ready to persevere,

00:08.480 --> 00:12.360
to go beyond the comfort level, to do another round.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.100
He didn't want to, Damn Right he didn't want to,

00:15.100 --> 00:17.280
but he knew we want him to,

00:17.280 --> 00:21.940
and he knew in order to pass the test, he had to do it.

00:21.940 --> 00:23.960
He goes, now it's gonna be your job

00:23.960 --> 00:26.700
to get him in the gym, make him mentally stronger,

00:26.700 --> 00:29.540
make him face things, and teach him how to slip punches.

00:29.540 --> 00:32.580
And create holes, and fill those freaking holes

00:32.580 --> 00:35.040
with devastating punches, this is the cause.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.260
With punches with bad intentions.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.820
The following is a conversation with Teddy Atlas,

00:43.820 --> 00:46.980
a legendary and at times controversial boxing trainer

00:46.980 --> 00:48.820
and commentator.

00:48.820 --> 00:51.100
When I was going to this conversation with Teddy,

00:51.100 --> 00:55.140
I was ready to talk boxing, styles, matches, techniques,

00:55.140 --> 00:58.220
tactics, and his analysis of individual fighters

00:58.260 --> 01:02.140
like Mike Tyson, Michael Moore, Klitschko's, Usyk,

01:02.140 --> 01:04.580
Bovetkin, Lomachenko, Triple G, Canelo,

01:04.580 --> 01:08.540
Muhammad Ali, Chagre, Leonard, Hagler, Duran, Floyd,

01:08.540 --> 01:10.620
and on and on and on.

01:10.620 --> 01:14.540
Like I said, I came ready to talk boxing,

01:14.540 --> 01:17.240
but I stayed for something even bigger.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.300
The Shakespearean human story of Teddy Atlas,

01:20.300 --> 01:23.660
Custamato, and Mike Tyson.

01:23.660 --> 01:27.680
It's a story about loyalty, betrayal, fear,

01:27.720 --> 01:29.160
and greatness.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.340
It's a story where nobody is perfect,

01:31.340 --> 01:33.680
and everybody is human.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.480
To summarize, in the early 80s,

01:35.480 --> 01:39.280
young trainer Teddy Atlas worked with his mentor,

01:39.280 --> 01:42.920
Custamato, in training the young boxing protege,

01:42.920 --> 01:46.640
now a boxing legend, Mike Tyson.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.720
Mike was a troubled youth, arrested over 40 times,

01:49.720 --> 01:53.120
and at age 15, he was sexually inappropriate

01:53.120 --> 01:55.720
with Teddy's 11-year-old niece.

01:55.720 --> 01:59.520
In response to this, Teddy put a .38 caliber handgun

01:59.520 --> 02:02.640
to Tyson's ear and told him to never touch his family again,

02:02.640 --> 02:05.720
or he would kill him if he did.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.420
For this, Custamato kicked Teddy out.

02:08.420 --> 02:09.720
Why?

02:09.720 --> 02:11.320
Well, that's complicated.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.040
In part, I think, to help minimize the chance

02:14.040 --> 02:17.280
of Mike Tyson, who Cust legally adopted,

02:17.280 --> 02:19.820
will be taken away by the state,

02:19.820 --> 02:21.720
and with him, the dream of developing

02:21.720 --> 02:24.680
one of the greatest boxers of all time.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.940
Of course, that summary doesn't capture

02:26.940 --> 02:28.640
the full complexity of human nature

02:28.640 --> 02:31.280
and human drama involved here.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.440
For that, you have to listen to this conversation,

02:34.440 --> 02:37.580
the things said and the things left unsaid,

02:37.580 --> 02:41.040
the pain in Teddy's voice, the contradictions of love

02:41.040 --> 02:43.580
and anger that permeate his stories

02:43.580 --> 02:45.140
and his philosophy on life.

02:46.140 --> 02:49.440
Like I said, I came to talk about boxing

02:49.440 --> 02:51.540
and stayed to talk about life.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.240
This conversation will stay with me for a long time.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.500
The people close to you, the people you trust,

03:00.500 --> 03:03.760
the people you love are everything.

03:03.760 --> 03:07.500
And if they betray you and break your heart, forgive them.

03:08.460 --> 03:10.900
Forgive yourself and try again.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.900
Happy holidays, everyone.

03:13.900 --> 03:14.800
I love you all.

03:21.120 --> 03:25.080
And now, dear friends, here's Teddy Atlas.

03:26.020 --> 03:27.680
You wrote in the book that your father

03:27.680 --> 03:29.820
had a big influence on your life.

03:29.820 --> 03:33.020
What lessons have you learned about life from your father?

03:33.960 --> 03:35.880
When he asked that question, you know,

03:36.880 --> 03:38.920
I remember Customato, when I was with him

03:38.920 --> 03:40.520
up in Gatsby for all those years,

03:40.520 --> 03:45.180
he used to say to me, Teddy, you learned through osmosis.

03:45.180 --> 03:49.680
I believe that's true to that, if I know what osmosis is,

03:50.680 --> 03:55.680
and I, but it sounds good, but I learned through osmosis

03:55.800 --> 03:59.680
with my father, he wasn't a big talker, he was,

03:59.680 --> 04:00.840
you know, he was a doer.

04:00.840 --> 04:05.680
And I, when you're around someone who lives a certain

04:05.680 --> 04:10.040
kind of life and does certain things, it penetrates.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.300
He was a doctor.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.680
He was, I'm gonna sound like an idiot right now

04:13.680 --> 04:18.280
because I'm being a son, but he was the greatest

04:18.280 --> 04:23.280
magnetistic doctor, I mean, if I say I ever knew,

04:23.600 --> 04:25.120
what's that mean, you know what I mean?

04:25.120 --> 04:27.520
Are you a doctor, you know what I mean?

04:27.520 --> 04:28.780
Like, what does that mean?

04:28.780 --> 04:31.560
But other people have told me this,

04:31.560 --> 04:33.160
like just legendary stories.

04:33.160 --> 04:34.920
He would do house calls and help people,

04:34.920 --> 04:36.580
and like you said, a lot of people have spoken

04:36.580 --> 04:38.640
about the impact he's had on their life.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.520
He built two hospitals, and he built a hospital

04:42.520 --> 04:45.140
before the Verrazato Bridge in New York,

04:45.140 --> 04:46.800
connecting Brooklyn to Staten Island,

04:46.800 --> 04:51.760
and he built it so people could get proper hospital care

04:51.760 --> 04:53.240
that couldn't afford it, period.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.600
And everybody looked at him as eccentric.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.240
Yeah, nice.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.920
Yeah, because he would literally sneak patients,

05:03.920 --> 05:05.640
not sneak them in, he was Dr. Atlas.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.160
He could do what he wanted to a certain extent,

05:07.160 --> 05:11.600
but he would bring patients in without administering,

05:11.600 --> 05:14.720
putting through administration, so there was no charge

05:14.760 --> 05:17.000
because they didn't have anything.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.160
They were street people.

05:19.120 --> 05:23.040
I remember being, my only way to be with my father

05:23.040 --> 05:26.200
was to go on house calls, or to go to the door.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.280
There's no, you know, and so I went on house calls with him.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.760
And he did house calls, by the way, too, he was 80,

05:31.760 --> 05:34.800
and treat us, I mean, it was better than like McDonald's,

05:34.800 --> 05:36.960
you know what I mean, I mean, the deal.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.320
You treat us, and you got medicine, you got everything.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.920
And, but he used to, right around the holidays,

05:44.920 --> 05:47.400
there was just certain things that I didn't understand,

05:47.400 --> 05:51.880
but I understood later, where we would just drive

05:51.880 --> 05:54.400
certain areas, and he just, all of a sudden,

05:54.400 --> 05:57.280
opened his door, and he would pick up things,

05:57.280 --> 06:00.960
and you know, I'm 10 years old, you know,

06:00.960 --> 06:04.160
move over, move over, you know, and.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.880
It's just you, him, and a homeless guy.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.720
A couple.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.560
Yeah, a couple.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.040
Yeah, whatever he could fit in, three, four, you know,

06:10.680 --> 06:11.520
whatever it was.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.360
That's a big heart.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.760
And then he took him to the hospital, dropped him off.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.400
So, you know, I would ask questions after it was all over,

06:16.400 --> 06:18.120
but I'd say, Dad, they're sick.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.880
He goes, well, not in a way,

06:20.880 --> 06:23.400
whether you put them in the hospital.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.080
So he said, yeah, and he tried to explain things to me.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.200
You know, he would try, he didn't talk much

06:28.200 --> 06:29.600
unless you asked him something.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.440
Yeah.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.800
That kind of works, and you know,

06:31.800 --> 06:33.520
don't talk unless someone asks you something.

06:33.520 --> 06:38.520
And he explained to me that, he said,

06:40.480 --> 06:42.120
I said, well, why are you putting them in the hospital?

06:42.120 --> 06:43.600
Then, you know, and of course,

06:43.600 --> 06:45.520
the sickness was they were alcoholics,

06:45.520 --> 06:50.240
but why are you putting, it wasn't an alcohol rehab,

06:50.240 --> 06:51.960
you know, so why are you putting,

06:51.960 --> 06:54.120
and it wasn't for the purpose to dry out.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.360
He wasn't trying to cure them.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.200
Yeah.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.520
Let's put that for before we anoint him for sainthood,

06:59.520 --> 07:01.200
you know, like by Teddy Atlas.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.560
So I was like, we finally get to the point.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
Why are you putting them in there?

07:04.560 --> 07:05.800
Yeah.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.760
Well, because it's the holidays.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.160
All right, why you put them in there?

07:12.080 --> 07:13.680
Well, the holidays, you know,

07:13.680 --> 07:16.200
are good for certain people and bad for others.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.600
And it was always before the holidays.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.680
It was before Christmas or whatever,

07:21.680 --> 07:24.240
and New Year's, whatever.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.600
And so I said, why?

07:27.920 --> 07:32.120
And he said, because they remind people,

07:32.120 --> 07:34.080
certain people, of what they don't have.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.840
Yeah.

07:35.840 --> 07:40.080
That other people enjoy the holidays

07:40.080 --> 07:42.960
because of what they have, family, you know, whatever.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.720
And it reminds them, their mind is that.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.560
That's pretty profound.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.760
Yeah, and then, I don't know if you remember,

07:50.760 --> 07:54.160
because he didn't use the word suicide, but I got it.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.280
Like he basically, I forget how he said it,

07:56.280 --> 07:58.200
but like, I just got it.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.920
I don't know how I got it, I don't know.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.600
But I just got it like, so they don't hurt themselves.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.440
Yeah.

08:03.880 --> 08:04.720
In every way.

08:04.720 --> 08:05.880
I don't think he ever articulated,

08:05.880 --> 08:09.600
I ever verbalized that, but yeah, they don't hurt themselves.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.800
And well, how does that work?

08:11.800 --> 08:15.760
Well, just basically, they're gonna be around people.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.840
They're not gonna be alone.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.400
They're gonna be around people, they're gonna get fed.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.120
They're gonna be warm, right?

08:20.120 --> 08:22.920
And it's gonna be for three days, two, three days, whatever.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.960
And basically, it's a bridge.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.360
So, and the funny thing is, a 10-year-old,

08:29.480 --> 08:33.480
I wanted to, I wanna be connected to him.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.680
So I enlisted myself in the job.

08:36.680 --> 08:40.680
When he used to drop them off,

08:40.680 --> 08:43.200
he would take them and get them in, right?

08:43.200 --> 08:48.200
And then the thing that I know, again, he didn't say none,

08:49.080 --> 08:51.200
but you notice things.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.120
And if you care enough,

08:54.120 --> 08:56.560
you don't notice nothing if you don't care.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.480
But if you care if it's important, you notice.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.040
And this guy was important to me.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.400
I just was, I didn't know what a hero was, no clue.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.200
I loved Mickey Mano, I loved Willie Mays,

09:07.200 --> 09:09.920
I loved Muhammad Ali.

09:11.680 --> 09:15.680
I never, ever connected him in my mind as heroes, never.

09:16.520 --> 09:21.280
My father, I didn't connect it that way, but he-

09:21.280 --> 09:22.120
Looking back now-

09:22.120 --> 09:25.240
Looking back, he was my first connection to a hero.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.080
The two of you ever talk about how much you love each other?

09:29.080 --> 09:29.920
The word love?

09:29.920 --> 09:33.240
One thing that was not allowed.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.600
The greatest memory I have, my father showing me love,

09:36.600 --> 09:39.600
was we were down in Florida at an airport,

09:39.600 --> 09:43.480
and we were, I was born in Miami,

09:43.480 --> 09:45.160
don't ask me, I was passing through,

09:45.160 --> 09:48.840
and that's my family is born in New York right now.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.600
And so I was supposed to go background, right?

09:51.640 --> 09:55.760
And I wanted to stay with my mother for whatever reason.

09:55.760 --> 10:00.760
And so he, you know, he, of course, conceded to it,

10:01.760 --> 10:05.600
and he's, okay, you know, whatever, and very quiet, very,

10:05.600 --> 10:09.840
and there's a man who never showed emotion to anyone.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.560
I mean, for the most, you know, really.

10:12.560 --> 10:17.000
All of a sudden, he just turned,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.320
kissed me on the forehead and left.

10:19.360 --> 10:23.880
And I was like, that's different.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.120
Yeah, you still remember that, huh?

10:26.120 --> 10:28.120
Yeah, like, that's weird.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.520
You lost them 30 years ago.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.880
How did that change you?

10:39.520 --> 10:41.440
It made me realize that some of the deals

10:41.440 --> 10:45.840
I used to make for God were unrealistic.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.360
When I was a kid, I used to make deals

10:47.400 --> 10:49.680
for God, let me die before my father.

10:54.840 --> 10:58.120
And then, you know, you get older, you have kids,

10:58.120 --> 11:01.480
you're blessed, why did you make that deal?

11:01.480 --> 11:02.320
You know what I mean?

11:02.320 --> 11:07.320
Like, thank you for not taking me up on it.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.720
Yeah.

11:08.720 --> 11:09.560
Thanks.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.400
Yeah.

11:13.000 --> 11:13.840
You know?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.800
Oh yeah, you miss him?

11:15.800 --> 11:20.080
I miss him in moments when I'd like to know what to do.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.760
And, you know, I remember when I would drive with him

11:25.760 --> 11:29.000
on the house calls, he didn't listen to music.

11:30.320 --> 11:34.560
He was a guy, he read books to his, when he got older,

11:34.560 --> 11:39.040
he read books to blood vessels broken in his eyes.

11:39.960 --> 11:44.960
He only read nonfiction books, science, he loved science,

11:45.560 --> 11:48.720
wars, generals.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.600
I mean, I cheated on a couple of book reports

11:51.600 --> 11:54.160
because I didn't do the reading of the book.

11:54.160 --> 11:57.200
The night before, I had a freaking book report

11:57.200 --> 11:58.280
to put in that.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.920
I got a book report to do on the War of Stalingrad.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.720
Really, the War of Stalingrad.

12:03.720 --> 12:08.200
And who the freak could tell you when you get an A?

12:08.200 --> 12:09.040
I got an A.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.080
I just wrote what he told me.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.640
He told me generals, he told me times,

12:13.640 --> 12:16.200
he told me strategy, he told me about the winter

12:16.200 --> 12:18.120
that came and destroyed the Germans

12:18.120 --> 12:23.120
and the Soviets were tougher than the Germans.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.840
And, you know, the Germans picked on the wrong opponent.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.640
I was already in the boxing business.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.080
I didn't even know it.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.720
I didn't even know it.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.560
Matchmaking, very important.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.360
They mismatched.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.520
They made a mistake with picking the opponent.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.280
And so when we would be driving in the car,

12:42.280 --> 12:45.440
my father would be in a trance.

12:46.760 --> 12:51.640
And dad, he wasn't ignoring me at all.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.160
He was just with his thoughts.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.400
He was wherever.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.560
He wasn't even here on the radio no more.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.040
I always wondered where he was.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.520
I did, so I asked him one day.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.160
And just, so we're driving, I said, I want to know.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.600
So I said, dad, what do you think

13:07.600 --> 13:11.240
when you're basically in this place

13:11.240 --> 13:15.400
that I know you're somewhere, where are you?

13:16.360 --> 13:17.800
What do you see?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.440
I actually said, what do you see?

13:20.560 --> 13:24.080
And he said to me, I see what could be.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.040
I see what could be.

13:28.040 --> 13:32.200
And I'm like, oh, all right.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.880
I gotta ask you, when did you discover boxing?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.200
When did you first fall in love with boxing?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.360
When it saved me.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.080
How did it save you?

13:43.080 --> 13:47.760
I was a stupid, violent kid that was angry.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.440
Not exactly know why he was angry.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.360
I'd fit in real good in today's society

13:55.360 --> 13:57.040
because there's a lot of angry kids out there

13:57.040 --> 13:59.520
that I don't think they know why they're angry.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.240
I was just out there getting fights

14:02.240 --> 14:05.480
and I got this stupid thing from that.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.680
Can you tell the story of how you got that?

14:07.680 --> 14:11.160
I was just running around doing stupid things, bad things.

14:12.040 --> 14:16.360
Some people physically, but I hurt my family.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.080
That's BS, you only hurt yourself.

14:22.080 --> 14:26.280
That's a good way of alibi-ing it.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.880
But at some point, the truth usually finds its way.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.760
I'd like it to look like I was just hurting myself,

14:35.760 --> 14:37.600
but I wasn't, obviously.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.040
So I was just out on the streets

14:41.880 --> 14:43.360
with kids that didn't grow up in the neighborhood I grew up.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.720
I grew up in a neighborhood where my father was a doctor

14:46.720 --> 14:48.880
and I walked down the street.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.640
The funny thing was down the hill

14:50.640 --> 14:53.680
was a very tough neighborhood called Stapleton.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.120
Most of the people down there on the corners

14:56.120 --> 14:57.720
wished they could get up to hell

14:57.720 --> 15:00.280
and I wished I could get down the hill.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.000
So I went down the hill and I hung out

15:03.000 --> 15:06.680
with all these friends that became lifelong friends.

15:11.520 --> 15:15.440
I gravitated to that because I figured it out later,

15:15.440 --> 15:17.960
a little bit, but I wanted a family.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.720
We were destroying a family.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.520
My father was a doctor, he didn't have time for nothing

15:23.520 --> 15:24.640
but being a doctor.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.520
I think when you're great at something,

15:27.520 --> 15:28.960
you sacrifice something too.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.720
When you're really great at something.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.760
So great that maybe God made you great

15:34.760 --> 15:37.480
and you're too great for your own good.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.920
And I don't know, it took me to these stupid,

15:41.120 --> 15:42.600
dangerous places.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.480
Dangerous for me but dangerous for other people too

15:44.480 --> 15:46.840
because I got to the point where I was doing robbies

15:46.840 --> 15:49.520
on the street, I was fighting everybody

15:49.520 --> 15:52.720
and you know what the most dangerous part about it was?

15:52.720 --> 15:56.040
And I came to this realization on my own, all by myself.

15:56.040 --> 16:00.960
I figured out, I was really as dangerous,

16:00.960 --> 16:04.160
these kids from the project, some of them, they got nothing.

16:04.160 --> 16:07.760
First of all, I learned you don't have to be poor

16:07.760 --> 16:08.600
to be poor.

16:09.480 --> 16:13.440
You don't have to be deprived of certain things

16:13.440 --> 16:14.560
to be deprived.

16:16.320 --> 16:21.320
And because you, at least to think you're deprived.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.280
And I was poor in a way that I didn't have

16:24.280 --> 16:27.000
the only thing I wanted to have, him.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
So here I am where I'm out there doing these things

16:33.400 --> 16:35.800
and what made me more, I was more dangerous

16:35.800 --> 16:37.440
than some of these psychopaths,

16:37.960 --> 16:39.520
well I was a psychopath too I guess,

16:39.520 --> 16:42.760
the way it was behaving, but some of these psychopaths

16:42.760 --> 16:47.760
that really had nothing, they obviously would kill you.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.800
I was dangerous almost in the same way

16:53.800 --> 16:55.640
but for a different reason.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.600
I know it's ridiculous what I'm about to tell you

16:57.600 --> 17:01.520
but I figured it out because I felt it.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.480
I thought I was on a righteous path.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.800
I thought I had a right.

17:04.800 --> 17:09.480
I thought I had a right because it was gonna get me

17:09.480 --> 17:10.520
my father back.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.200
Why, why?

17:13.200 --> 17:16.760
I mean you're a scientist, you couldn't figure this one out

17:16.760 --> 17:21.760
because all the people that had him were injured people,

17:22.200 --> 17:25.760
fractured people, screwed up people in some ways

17:25.760 --> 17:28.320
but hurt, damaged people.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.080
So if I get damaged, I get him.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.000
So I was on a crusade, really a righteous crusade

17:39.040 --> 17:41.880
where I thought it was okay.

17:41.880 --> 17:43.720
I had permission.

17:43.720 --> 17:48.720
I had permission to do these terrible things quite frankly

17:48.920 --> 17:53.920
and to fight everyone and then it came almost to a crash

17:58.000 --> 18:01.560
doing all that, winding up in Rikers Island like an idiot.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.360
Not understanding the damage I did to this poor man

18:05.360 --> 18:10.080
that he was a great doctor and he's gotta see his son

18:10.080 --> 18:12.440
and hear about, you know what I mean?

18:12.440 --> 18:17.440
Like, God, I was out on that day

18:18.600 --> 18:21.280
with the guys that I grew up with now,

18:21.280 --> 18:24.240
the guys from the projects as I described

18:24.240 --> 18:27.600
and I was with one of them who, he's dead now.

18:27.600 --> 18:32.600
So I was with him and we were in a neighborhood,

18:33.480 --> 18:35.800
the neighborhood we grew up in that I hung out in

18:35.800 --> 18:40.200
and he grew up in, Billy, he came from the project

18:40.200 --> 18:43.600
and we got into a thing where somebody comes off,

18:43.600 --> 18:46.200
we cut them off, jumped out to fight

18:47.520 --> 18:52.280
and it turned out there's like five or six of them

18:52.280 --> 18:53.480
and two of us.

18:54.160 --> 18:59.160
And we fought right on the side, right there,

19:00.840 --> 19:04.160
only about a block from where I used to hang out

19:04.160 --> 19:06.320
and maybe a block and a half

19:06.320 --> 19:09.240
and right in front of like a Spanish bodega

19:09.240 --> 19:12.520
and it really does happen in slow motion.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.920
I actually saw the guy, I was fighting the guys

19:14.920 --> 19:18.120
that I had to fight and then all of a sudden

19:18.120 --> 19:22.040
I was able to get one guy out of the way a little bit

19:22.040 --> 19:26.000
and I really, I noticed the guy go into his pocket

19:26.840 --> 19:30.680
and I knew why he was going in his pocket, you know?

19:30.680 --> 19:35.200
And when he came out of his pocket,

19:35.200 --> 19:36.800
I knew what it was right away, it was weird

19:36.800 --> 19:39.600
because in the neighborhood guys used to hang out,

19:39.600 --> 19:42.440
they were into this, you know, they get into fads

19:42.440 --> 19:45.120
like right on the streets and they were into,

19:45.120 --> 19:47.080
at that time they were into this cheap knife

19:47.080 --> 19:50.200
but it was, they thought it was, well, we thought it was cool.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.600
It was a 007 and the cool thing, whatever,

19:55.440 --> 19:58.440
was that you could flick it, you could learn

19:58.440 --> 19:59.800
and I learned how to flick, you know,

19:59.800 --> 20:02.960
but I never carried a knife but when my friends would have it

20:02.960 --> 20:05.640
I would just, you learn how you could flick it open,

20:05.640 --> 20:08.640
not a switchblade but flick it with your wrist

20:08.640 --> 20:12.360
and I was like, here I am in the middle of this freaking fight

20:12.360 --> 20:14.680
and all of a sudden, oh, it's a 007, you know?

20:14.680 --> 20:19.680
And so I'm like, you gotta make a decision

20:21.080 --> 20:26.080
and I gotta split, I can either not do nothing

20:27.080 --> 20:32.080
which didn't seem like a great, you know, a great option.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.720
I couldn't run away.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.560
Why not?

20:39.680 --> 20:41.280
Because you gotta live with yourself afterwards

20:41.280 --> 20:44.520
and that's more difficult to live with

20:44.520 --> 20:46.000
than whatever it is at that second

20:46.000 --> 20:47.160
because that don't go away.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.360
You couldn't live with yourself running away.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.880
It just don't go away.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.360
That thing, nothing to do with being brave.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.760
Nothing to do with being brave, really.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.960
It's got to do with just common sense in life

20:59.960 --> 21:04.680
that for me, whatever you're dealing with, it's over,

21:04.680 --> 21:08.720
it's done, like, okay, deal with it, good or bad, whatever

21:08.720 --> 21:13.640
but you do that, you know, that other thing, you can't.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.520
That never ends.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.840
This thing ends.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.320
The memory of you being, let's say, a coward

21:22.320 --> 21:24.800
in that moment, that never ends.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.680
The only thing I had at that point in my life

21:27.680 --> 21:31.120
in my stupid mind was a reputation

21:32.040 --> 21:35.040
that I would do, stand up to certain things.

21:37.040 --> 21:41.480
And that, for me, was worth something, whatever

21:41.480 --> 21:44.680
because I didn't feel any worth to anything else.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.600
That was the only thing I felt a connection of worth to.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.360
You stood your ground and you got cut.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.880
No, I made a decision.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.720
I stood my ground, but I actually, things do slow down.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.560
They do.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.880
And I actually said, it's a double seven,

21:57.880 --> 22:00.080
he's got to flick it, you know, I didn't say,

22:00.080 --> 22:01.720
but he's got to flick it.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.840
I got a split second, either, like I said,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.640
either I do nothing, whatever, or I get to him

22:06.640 --> 22:08.440
before he gets it flicked.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.840
I went to get to him before he got flicked.

22:10.840 --> 22:15.840
And just as I got close to him, I did him a favor.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.080
I walked right into a counterpunch

22:21.240 --> 22:24.360
because I cooperated with him.

22:24.360 --> 22:25.480
I went right to him.

22:25.480 --> 22:30.480
And just as I, he practiced more than I did

22:31.400 --> 22:34.000
with the double seven, apparently,

22:34.000 --> 22:37.720
because he was like, boom, boom, boom, boom.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.600
And anyway.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.520
What did you think?

22:42.520 --> 22:44.280
What did you think that happened?

22:44.320 --> 22:46.000
I was all slow motion.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.400
Did you think he might die?

22:49.640 --> 22:52.720
Yeah, well, not immediately.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.120
Took me a minute.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.160
I'm a slow learner.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.840
I put my hand up.

22:57.840 --> 22:58.680
Right, wouldn't you?

22:58.680 --> 22:59.720
I guess so.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.520
And it went into my face.

23:01.520 --> 23:02.600
And that was it.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.800
It was gooey.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.120
It was warm and gooey.

23:06.120 --> 23:11.080
And I was like, I don't know what this means,

23:11.080 --> 23:12.400
but I don't want to know.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.040
But I think I know.

23:14.040 --> 23:14.880
And.

23:21.520 --> 23:24.080
Did you think about your dad in that moment?

23:24.080 --> 23:26.240
No, you know, what I thought about him was

23:28.160 --> 23:30.800
you don't know who anyone is until they test it.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.240
And I learned that.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.600
Kuss used to tell me, but I learned it.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.360
He used to say, I remember one time,

23:37.360 --> 23:40.480
because I was a 17, 18 year old kid up there

23:40.480 --> 23:44.680
and thought I was whatever I thought I was.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.800
And he said, you got a lot of friends?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.880
And I said, yeah.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.120
Because I was on the street

23:50.120 --> 23:52.680
hanging out with a hundred kids at night sometimes

23:52.680 --> 23:53.520
on the street corner.

23:53.520 --> 23:56.760
So I was like, I don't know too many people

23:56.760 --> 23:59.280
that hung out with a hundred kids on the street

23:59.280 --> 24:02.120
on the corner on a Friday, Saturday night.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.320
And I was like, yeah, I got a lot of friends.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.120
He goes, really?

24:07.120 --> 24:08.440
Yeah, really?

24:08.480 --> 24:13.480
He said, how about if I told you, you might not have any?

24:14.480 --> 24:16.400
Most likely you don't have any.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.400
And he goes, and then he just started this thing.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.560
He said, everyone's got to be tested.

24:23.560 --> 24:27.160
You, me, everyone.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.880
Because you don't know about nobody until they're tested.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.360
He goes, you know nothing.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.600
Because you know nothing until you know.

24:34.600 --> 24:38.040
Until something happens to test if they were really a friend.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.360
And then he told me this story about a guy.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.960
A guy came to him and he was upset.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.320
Who are you upset about?

24:44.320 --> 24:49.320
He goes, I'm upset because I just lost a friend.

24:52.400 --> 24:56.080
After 20 years of friendship, we're not friends no more.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.680
So he looks at him and he goes,

24:58.800 --> 24:59.640
let me ask you a question.

24:59.640 --> 25:02.280
What made you think you were ever friends with him?

25:02.280 --> 25:03.440
Now the guy gets insulted.

25:03.440 --> 25:05.400
He goes, did you hear me?

25:05.400 --> 25:08.000
He goes, I just told you, 20 years.

25:08.960 --> 25:09.920
I've been friends with this guy.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.920
Why would you say that to me?

25:11.920 --> 25:15.080
He said, well, I'll say it again.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.200
What makes you think he was your friend?

25:17.200 --> 25:21.360
He goes, whatever happened in the 20 years

25:21.360 --> 25:23.160
other than chasing girls.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.360
Figured that one out fast.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.280
Chasing girls and drinking together.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.160
And whatever else you're doing out on the street.

25:32.160 --> 25:37.160
What ever gave you the inclination that he was a friend?

25:38.320 --> 25:42.840
He goes, whatever, when did he risk himself to be your friend?

25:42.840 --> 25:44.680
When was it dangerous to be your friend?

25:44.680 --> 25:45.920
When was the friendship tested?

25:45.920 --> 25:49.600
When was it uncomfortable to be your friend?

25:49.600 --> 25:50.720
And you know what the guy said?

25:50.720 --> 25:52.480
You can figure it out, you're a scientist.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.320
He said,

25:56.440 --> 25:58.560
he said, today.

26:00.760 --> 26:05.760
And today came for me and today, today, today, today

26:05.920 --> 26:09.400
today, kept coming for me, today.

26:09.400 --> 26:13.600
And that day my friend Billy had turned out

26:13.600 --> 26:16.720
while I was fighting these, whatever, five, six guys.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.160
And where was Billy?

26:18.160 --> 26:19.200
He was on the roof.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.600
He was on the roof.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.440
He was on the roof.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.360
He was my best friend.

26:27.640 --> 26:31.320
And so anyway, they take me to the hospital.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.720
And here's the thing with my father.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.440
But one thing Billy did do for me

26:35.440 --> 26:38.120
when he got off the roof, thank God,

26:38.120 --> 26:42.440
he did, he dragged me, dragged me into this bodega,

26:42.440 --> 26:45.800
laid me on the floor and started putting towels.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.960
And the towels, I vaguely remember this,

26:51.960 --> 26:54.000
they filled up with blood.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.080
I mean, completely like drenched,

26:56.080 --> 26:58.720
like you put them under a shower.

26:58.720 --> 27:03.720
And I heard the bodega owner screaming, screaming,

27:04.560 --> 27:07.240
like, ah, you know, whatever.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.880
And everyone's screaming and there's chaos.

27:09.880 --> 27:14.440
And I'm like, I don't know, I'm calm, weird.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.800
I'm like real calm.

27:16.960 --> 27:21.960
And I'm just in this place, things calm.

27:25.440 --> 27:29.960
And all of a sudden I hear Billy, he's screaming,

27:29.960 --> 27:32.840
call the ambulance, call the ambulance.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.760
And nobody's doing none, everyone's frozen.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.000
I'm starting to understand already.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.960
People get frozen in situations.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.760
People, the fear, fear, fear, fear, fear.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.640
Just paralyzes people.

27:48.640 --> 27:52.960
And I was going into a fear business.

27:52.960 --> 27:57.960
I was learning, I was getting a learning, early PhD.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.640
And he, yeah.

27:59.640 --> 28:04.480
And all of a sudden, genius, Billy, genius, really.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.760
Street kid.

28:06.760 --> 28:10.880
He jumps up on a freaking counter, jumps over the counter,

28:10.880 --> 28:14.320
grabs the phone, calls 911, says a cop's been shot,

28:15.360 --> 28:16.440
and forget about it.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.560
It was crazy.

28:18.560 --> 28:19.880
All I remember after that,

28:19.880 --> 28:21.280
I'll tell you a couple of things I remember.

28:21.280 --> 28:26.280
Lights being put onto a stretcher, bounced around,

28:27.440 --> 28:28.800
rushed.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.280
I felt everyone's anxiety, except mine.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.560
I had none.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.520
But I felt everyone's anxiety, everyone's fear.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.360
Like it was all around me.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.440
It was like, oh, this is interesting.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.000
It's kind of, I know that's stupid,

28:42.000 --> 28:45.080
but like, well, this is interesting.

28:45.080 --> 28:46.880
Wow, you really have an eye for fear.

28:46.880 --> 28:47.920
That's fascinating.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.680
You're really studying it.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.280
Well, I had no choice.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.440
I got introduced in a crash course.

28:53.440 --> 28:57.160
And they put me in ambulance.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.960
And this is what I remember to your point.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.920
I'm sorry it took so long to get to it.

29:00.920 --> 29:03.080
I am, although I'll probably do it again

29:03.080 --> 29:05.280
before this conversation's over.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.120
But I-

29:06.120 --> 29:06.960
It's all about the journey.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.720
Yeah, we'll get there.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.800
We'll get there, pops.

29:10.760 --> 29:14.400
So I hear the cops say, we might lose them.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.440
And I'm like laughing to myself.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.880
I'm not laughing because I'm not, again, I'm not John Wayne.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.400
John Wayne would have laughed.

29:22.400 --> 29:26.520
But I'm like, hey, lose.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.040
You guys are stupid.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.080
You know, I didn't say that.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.360
But I'm like, lose me?

29:32.200 --> 29:35.120
My father's the greatest doctor in the freaking world.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.640
There's nothing to worry about.

29:36.640 --> 29:41.640
You people are all uptight and whacked out here with fear.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.520
And there's nothing to worry about.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.160
Dr. Atlas is my father.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.600
So anyway, so they're taking me to the,

29:51.600 --> 29:53.240
and they said, well, we don't have time.

29:53.240 --> 29:55.200
I hear a couple of things I remember.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.640
Don't have time.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.920
Take them to, and they take me to

29:58.920 --> 30:00.800
U.S. Public Health Hospital.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.040
Marine Hospital was called at the time,

30:03.040 --> 30:04.720
but U.S. Public Health.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.000
And it's in Stapleton, so it's close.

30:07.000 --> 30:07.840
Thank God.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.560
So they're taking me and I hear them on the radio,

30:10.560 --> 30:13.680
you know, saying this stuff about,

30:13.680 --> 30:16.040
we gotta move, we gotta move.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.320
And I start talking.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.600
And they're telling me, don't talk.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.160
But I like to talk a lot, you know?

30:26.000 --> 30:29.240
So again, fear.

30:29.240 --> 30:33.040
There's no fear when a fear's been removed.

30:35.120 --> 30:37.760
It's the only time you're really free in life.

30:37.760 --> 30:42.600
And I know that sounds absurd, but really, it is.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.880
It's the only time you're really free in life.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.280
I was, when you're-

30:46.280 --> 30:47.400
Close to death?

30:47.400 --> 30:52.400
When you're devoid of things that normally hold you back,

30:52.960 --> 30:54.680
that normally influence you,

30:54.680 --> 30:59.080
in ways that are not of the influence

30:59.080 --> 31:01.360
that are always positive influence.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.720
Where you're in a pure place,

31:03.720 --> 31:06.640
where you're in a purely free place,

31:06.640 --> 31:09.960
from all inhibitions, from fear, from anxiety,

31:09.960 --> 31:13.840
from joy, joy can screw you up.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.600
And you're free from all these things,

31:16.600 --> 31:17.680
and I'm in this place.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.800
In the back of an ambulance, you're free.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.720
Yeah, I'm like, I said, just get me Dr. Atlas.

31:23.720 --> 31:25.920
And they say, we don't have time.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.760
No, no, no, no, no, you don't.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.240
You have to get Dr. Atlas.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.280
You have to get him.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.000
This was the, damn it, this was the,

31:34.000 --> 31:34.840
you know what I mean?

31:34.840 --> 31:36.240
I finally freaking hit the number,

31:36.240 --> 31:37.640
and I'm not getting paid.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.680
And then all of a sudden, I'm out.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.520
How many stitches?

31:40.520 --> 31:43.240
They, well, I think it was 400, 200 inside,

31:43.240 --> 31:45.080
200 outside, or whatever it was.

31:45.080 --> 31:45.920
A lot.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.920
Look, after 50, that number doesn't matter no more.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.760
I don't, whatever, 60, 70, 80, 90, whatever.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.360
You know, so I was fortunate.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.360
I was fortunate.

31:57.360 --> 32:00.000
And of course, I was fortunate they told me afterwards

32:00.000 --> 32:04.440
that I'd missed my jugular literally by like a centimeter.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.160
I mean, whatever.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.720
And so then we wouldn't be having

32:08.720 --> 32:10.640
this conversation, obviously.

32:10.640 --> 32:11.600
I'm glad you made it.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.720
Yeah, I'm kind of glad too.

32:13.760 --> 32:18.400
And it just missed my eye, which thank God.

32:18.400 --> 32:21.040
It's bad enough I have a scar matching me with a patch.

32:21.040 --> 32:25.400
I mean, it's enough that I got this freaking thing.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.520
And look, it goes all the way.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.360
You know what I mean?

32:29.360 --> 32:31.400
It's pretty long.

32:31.400 --> 32:36.400
And I don't know, I was out.

32:36.920 --> 32:41.920
And then somehow I sensed like they had the curtain closed.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.680
And it's amazing how vivid this is.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.680
And the curtains close and I see a shadow.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.440
I felt the presence.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.400
I did.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.800
And I felt him.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.280
He's a powerful guy.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.200
And I felt him.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.360
And I just see like a shadow.

33:00.360 --> 33:04.960
And all of a sudden the curtain gets pushed back.

33:04.960 --> 33:06.120
And I can't really see.

33:06.120 --> 33:11.120
It's dark and I'm out of it, but not completely out of it.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.440
And pushes the curtain back, comes in,

33:16.880 --> 33:21.120
and his hands, even though it's all bandaged, whatever,

33:21.120 --> 33:23.480
but his hand surveys.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.080
It felt safe.

33:30.080 --> 33:33.000
And it felt warm and safe.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.000
I was happy.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.840
And he got there.

33:37.840 --> 33:38.800
Did he say something?

33:38.800 --> 33:40.320
Yeah, yeah.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.240
Remember, I gave you a little bit of introduction

33:42.240 --> 33:43.080
to my father, right?

33:43.080 --> 33:44.320
You know him now a little bit, right?

33:44.320 --> 33:45.160
Yeah, yeah.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.200
What'd he say about the job?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.480
He just said, this is what he said.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.560
I remember to this day what he said.

33:50.560 --> 33:51.400
That I do remember.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.120
I don't know if it was six or five people,

33:53.120 --> 33:54.640
but this I do remember.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.040
Yeah.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.600
He said, they did a good job.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.600
You're gonna have a scar the rest of your life.

34:00.600 --> 34:01.440
And he left.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.280
Oh, man.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.560
They did a good job.

34:10.880 --> 34:14.240
You mentioned Custamato, legendary trainer.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.280
And you also mentioned,

34:15.280 --> 34:17.560
it turned out he really cared about you.

34:17.560 --> 34:21.520
In the book you write about a testimony he gave.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.360
I was hoping I could read it

34:24.360 --> 34:26.960
because it speaks to your character, it speaks to his.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.560
It's just powerful.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.440
The testimony goes, your honor,

34:31.440 --> 34:34.320
I realize you might not know much about me,

34:34.320 --> 34:36.880
but I spent my whole life developing young men.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.440
As a boxing manager, I trained two world champions,

34:39.480 --> 34:41.320
heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson

34:41.320 --> 34:44.200
and light heavyweight champion Jose Torres.

34:45.160 --> 34:48.160
I've also helped a lot of other young boys

34:48.160 --> 34:50.760
straighten out their lives and build character.

34:50.760 --> 34:54.560
I know things about Teddy Atlas this court doesn't know.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.840
Things you won't find on his arrest record.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.640
This boy has character.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.280
He has loyalty.

35:01.280 --> 35:04.360
He'll hurt himself before he'll let down a friend.

35:04.360 --> 35:08.360
These qualities are rare and they shouldn't be lost.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.560
He's made mistakes, we've all made mistakes,

35:11.560 --> 35:13.240
but I've come to know this boy.

35:13.240 --> 35:14.680
And if we lose him,

35:14.680 --> 35:18.240
we'll be losing someone who could help a lot of people.

35:18.240 --> 35:21.520
Please don't take this young boy's future away.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.480
It could be someone special.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.000
Let's not lose him, please.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.320
Those are powerful words from a powerful man.

35:31.320 --> 35:36.080
What have you learned about life from Mr. Custamato?

35:39.200 --> 35:43.720
He gave me a quote and he drilled into my head.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.480
I became his guy, you know.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.320
He loved me.

35:47.200 --> 35:48.040
I loved him.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.040
He said to me,

35:53.560 --> 35:58.240
Teddy, no matter what a man says,

35:58.240 --> 36:01.480
is what he does in the end that he intended to do all along.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.640
That's what I learned from Custamato.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.200
The rest of it is BS.

36:13.720 --> 36:18.000
A lot of people say things.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.880
You just have to give them a minute

36:19.880 --> 36:23.400
to let them show you eventually

36:25.440 --> 36:26.880
what they really meant by it.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.720
I always learned from him that

36:35.640 --> 36:36.840
everyone's afraid.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.160
Custamato's saying another great saying,

36:40.160 --> 36:42.160
you'll get a kick out of this.

36:42.160 --> 36:45.840
Anyone who's in a situation where fear should be prevalent,

36:45.840 --> 36:49.880
where fear is actually necessary to survive the situation,

36:49.880 --> 36:52.080
anyone who says that they're not afraid,

36:52.080 --> 36:53.880
they're one of two things.

36:53.880 --> 36:57.440
They're either a liar or they should go to a doctor

36:57.440 --> 36:59.480
to find out what the frick's wrong with them.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.240
He was right about that.

37:02.520 --> 37:06.320
We live in a taboo society where that word,

37:06.320 --> 37:09.600
to a certain extent, is taboo

37:09.600 --> 37:11.520
because it invokes weakness.

37:14.560 --> 37:21.560
We are just layers of what we saw and learned

37:21.560 --> 37:22.600
since we were kids.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.680
We all are.

37:23.680 --> 37:25.880
We're products of those layers.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.840
I learned that on my own, through some help.

37:29.320 --> 37:32.760
I learned that on my own, through some help.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.120
At the end of the day,

37:39.440 --> 37:44.440
fear, people will find their way of avoiding that term,

37:45.440 --> 37:47.400
so they use the word anxiety.

37:48.240 --> 37:53.240
They use the word butterflies, apprehension,

37:53.360 --> 37:58.360
apprehension, million different words.

37:58.880 --> 38:03.880
I find all those other words to be cousins of fear.

38:03.880 --> 38:07.920
And fear causes a lot of things in life.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.040
It causes a lot of problems,

38:10.040 --> 38:12.000
and it also solves a lot of problems.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.480
Without it, we couldn't be great.

38:15.880 --> 38:19.240
If we are great, if we ever have a chance to be great,

38:20.480 --> 38:22.560
or at least to aspire to be great.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.680
How does fear connect to greatness?

38:24.680 --> 38:27.520
That's a profound statement.

38:27.520 --> 38:31.400
Without fear, we wouldn't be able to be great.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.680
Yeah, you couldn't be great without fear

38:33.680 --> 38:38.680
because fear allows you to be brave.

38:40.240 --> 38:45.240
The most important word for me in this whole conversation,

38:45.240 --> 38:47.680
neighborhood, would be selfishness.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.720
It allows you to be, for a moment, less selfish.

38:52.880 --> 38:56.400
One of the things I learned, I guess, partly on my own.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.720
Everyone thinks my greatest teacher was Cuss.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.800
He was a great teacher, but mentor.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.440
My greatest teacher was my father, the one who never taught.

39:05.440 --> 39:10.440
And I realized one of the things to be better towards great

39:14.400 --> 39:19.400
is if you can submit less than we submit.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.360
See, one of the things that I'm afraid of,

39:22.360 --> 39:26.000
one of the things I was always quitting in my business,

39:26.000 --> 39:27.560
it's kind of not a good thing.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.280
Every business, I think.

39:31.240 --> 39:34.960
Yours is just more clear.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.040
Yeah, it hurts more.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.120
In the moment, at least.

39:42.120 --> 39:44.880
Yeah, in the moment, you're right, 100%,

39:44.880 --> 39:47.880
because something's hurt for a long time afterwards.

39:48.280 --> 39:51.840
And something like regret.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.200
Regret is the worst thing in the world

39:53.200 --> 39:55.280
because it's a solitary sentence.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.400
That's a powerful phrase.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.040
Regret is a solitary sentence.

40:02.040 --> 40:05.000
So, boy, you're full of good lines.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.520
It wasn't easy to accumulate them.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.200
It was a little bit hurtful.

40:17.640 --> 40:22.640
So submit less, because we submit every day.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.680
And if we can get to a place where we submit

40:24.680 --> 40:29.360
or compromise ourselves less, we'll get to a better place.

40:30.800 --> 40:35.800
Again, one of the words for me that attaches to things

40:36.440 --> 40:41.440
that wind up hurting you in life and have hurt me in life,

40:42.400 --> 40:47.400
one of those boogeymen words is the word of convenience.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.800
That's attached to everything.

40:49.800 --> 40:54.800
People disappoint you not because they wanna disappoint you

40:55.800 --> 40:57.560
or let you down or betray you

40:58.480 --> 41:00.360
because they wanna betray you.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.840
They do it because it's more convenient to do

41:03.840 --> 41:05.160
than the other thing.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.320
An old man once told me, he said to me,

41:12.440 --> 41:13.880
I was trying to rationalize something.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.720
I was trying to make someone an excuse for something.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.400
I was trying to make myself better than I was.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.880
I was trying to say it was okay.

41:21.880 --> 41:25.760
And he just looked at me, and he liked me.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.920
And he said, Teddy,

41:28.800 --> 41:31.560
there ain't no such thing as being a little pregnant.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.520
I was like, yeah.

41:36.520 --> 41:39.840
Because either you're pregnant or you're not pregnant.

41:39.920 --> 41:42.320
Either you're real or you're not real.

41:42.320 --> 41:46.200
Either you're truthful or you're not truthful.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.560
Either you're tough or you're not tough.

41:47.560 --> 41:52.560
Either you're committed or you're not committed.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.120
Either you're in or you're out.

41:56.400 --> 41:59.240
That applies to a lot of things, including loyalty.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.920
That's quite a statement.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.560
But the life level of humanity for me is loyalty.

42:05.560 --> 42:08.520
It's what goes through the veins of,

42:08.520 --> 42:11.160
everything has to have some veins in some form.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.440
And if humanity has veins,

42:13.440 --> 42:15.840
what runs through the veins of humanity

42:15.840 --> 42:19.040
instead of blood to keep it alive is loyalty.

42:19.040 --> 42:22.120
Without loyalty, we're dead.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.880
We're freaking, we're vessels.

42:23.880 --> 42:26.240
I never understood what a ghost ship was.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.320
You know what, as I got older,

42:27.320 --> 42:29.680
I know what a ghost ship is, it's people.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.720
It's people that are empty.

42:31.720 --> 42:32.800
They got no loyalty.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.800
Therefore, they got no humanity.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.200
Therefore, they got nothing.

42:39.120 --> 42:42.280
Therefore, freak them, freak them.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.720
Because, and you know why they don't have loyalty?

42:45.720 --> 42:46.840
Convenience.

42:46.840 --> 42:47.760
And you know why?

42:49.240 --> 42:52.960
Because it takes, it's hard to be loyal.

42:52.960 --> 42:54.960
It's actually hard.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.960
I'll be a son of a gun.

42:56.960 --> 42:59.640
You're telling me, yeah, it sounds great.

42:59.640 --> 43:01.920
Give it to me, give it to me, paint me with it.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.120
Yeah, it's great, yeah, I'm loyal.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.560
Yeah, yeah, this is good, I'm ready.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.840
I'm on that team, I'm ready.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.440
Put me in, coach, I'm ready.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.120
Okay, now, you have to,

43:13.200 --> 43:14.360
you're gonna have to get hurt here.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.480
What do you mean get hurt?

43:15.480 --> 43:17.280
Oh, it's gonna be painful.

43:17.280 --> 43:20.440
I mean, to be loyal, you're gonna be in danger

43:20.440 --> 43:23.160
because the person that you committed your loyalty to

43:23.160 --> 43:25.000
for a reason, because obviously,

43:25.000 --> 43:27.400
you did something in your life, whatever, whatever,

43:29.400 --> 43:31.000
you're actually gonna get hurt to be loyal to them.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.200
You're actually gonna, hold on a minute, wait,

43:33.200 --> 43:34.400
hold on a minute, coach.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.960
Hold on, call time, here.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.280
Let me think about this, coach.

43:42.280 --> 43:44.280
I might need more practice.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.760
I'm not ready for the game.

43:45.760 --> 43:47.600
I'm not ready to go in the game yet.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.280
Give me a little more practice, coach.

43:49.280 --> 43:53.680
And it hurts to be loyal, it freaking hurts.

43:53.680 --> 43:58.680
But with our loyalty, we're ghost ships.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.440
We got no strength, we got nothing.

44:03.280 --> 44:05.680
We got nothing.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.360
I agree with you in a deep fundamental sense,

44:08.360 --> 44:12.800
but there's a pain that comes with that.

44:12.800 --> 44:17.800
I have to ask you to introspect on this part of your life

44:18.800 --> 44:20.800
because of your value for loyalty.

44:22.080 --> 44:27.080
As people know, you and Kostomato trained young Mike Tyson.

44:27.320 --> 44:32.080
And the interaction there between the three of you

44:32.080 --> 44:34.400
led to the three of you parting ways.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.120
Given your value for loyalty,

44:37.120 --> 44:41.480
can you tell the full story of what led up to this?

44:42.520 --> 44:47.520
And maybe the pain you felt from that?

44:47.760 --> 44:51.160
The pain you felt from that?

44:59.080 --> 45:02.120
I guess it was the second time in my life I felt betrayed.

45:03.920 --> 45:08.920
The first time was when I was whatever, young, 17,

45:11.560 --> 45:13.080
and I got arrested.

45:13.600 --> 45:18.600
I was with all these older guys, tough guys, whatever,

45:19.960 --> 45:24.960
and supposedly, and the detective separated us,

45:25.640 --> 45:27.280
that's what they do.

45:27.280 --> 45:32.280
And they asked me who did whatever, who's gun,

45:32.280 --> 45:36.000
this, that, all that particular stuff,

45:36.000 --> 45:40.920
obviously what we did, and it was me.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.080
They said, you sure?

45:43.080 --> 45:44.960
You don't want to change that?

45:44.960 --> 45:47.280
Because your friends changed it.

45:47.280 --> 45:50.320
And these cops, they were nasty, but they were cops.

45:50.320 --> 45:53.880
They were the way, you're gonna wind up in Rikers with,

45:53.880 --> 45:55.600
and they're gonna be doing this to you.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.320
And I won't even say the things because then,

45:58.320 --> 46:00.840
why say them, figure it out.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.040
But they're trying to get what they're trying to get,

46:03.040 --> 46:05.480
and you want to change it?

46:07.080 --> 46:07.920
No.

46:08.920 --> 46:13.000
But I felt very betrayed, you know?

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
And especially when I was standing in the cell in Rikers,

46:19.040 --> 46:21.960
looking at the airplanes leave LaGuardia Airport,

46:21.960 --> 46:24.360
and then hoping I was on one.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.440
I was making like a deal with God that,

46:26.440 --> 46:29.880
let me be on one of those planes and let it crash.

46:29.880 --> 46:31.480
I'd take a shot.

46:31.480 --> 46:34.320
Was part of you proud that you didn't give up your friends?

46:34.400 --> 46:38.080
No, because I didn't understand what proud was.

46:38.080 --> 46:39.080
I didn't understand nothing.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.880
I just understood that-

46:40.880 --> 46:43.680
Rules are rules, you're just loyal and that's it.

46:43.680 --> 46:46.120
I didn't even know there was an option.

46:46.120 --> 46:48.760
I didn't think, I know the cops said you could do this,

46:48.760 --> 46:51.720
but there was no option.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.680
My father never had an option.

46:54.680 --> 46:59.560
But the betrayal, the private betrayal was like,

46:59.560 --> 47:04.560
and so when Cuss, we were partners, me and Cuss.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.240
Cuss was retired.

47:09.120 --> 47:10.600
This stupid kid goes up there,

47:10.600 --> 47:13.560
and all of a sudden I start training fighters.

47:13.560 --> 47:15.560
First I won the gloves, Cuss put me in the gloves.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.400
I won the gloves that I had injury, whatever.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.720
But bottom line is, I still want to fight.

47:19.720 --> 47:22.440
I want to turn pro, I want to fight, that was the plan.

47:22.440 --> 47:25.960
And Cuss had a different plan.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.240
Cuss was like, you can't.

47:29.880 --> 47:31.760
And he had to set up a little bit, whatever,

47:31.760 --> 47:33.080
without getting into it.

47:33.080 --> 47:35.000
Hey, he did me a favor.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.200
And I'd like to think he knew he was doing me a favor.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.040
And you know what?

47:38.040 --> 47:39.400
I do think he was.

47:39.400 --> 47:41.360
He was doing himself a little bit, one too.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.480
But he was doing it for the greater cause,

47:43.480 --> 47:47.760
because he believed in this thing of boxing.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.920
He believed that it changed lives.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.920
He believed that it was worthwhile.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.320
He believed that there was a power to it

47:54.320 --> 47:55.840
beyond the left hook.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.960
The big picture of boxing.

47:56.960 --> 47:57.800
Yeah.

47:57.800 --> 47:58.640
He believed in it.

47:58.680 --> 48:01.120
He believed that to be a champion,

48:01.120 --> 48:02.880
you had to be special, you had to be smart,

48:02.880 --> 48:03.920
you had to have character,

48:03.920 --> 48:06.800
that you had to be a better person.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.560
And that you couldn't make a champion

48:08.560 --> 48:10.520
if you didn't make him a better person first.

48:10.520 --> 48:15.520
And that this could strengthen people,

48:15.600 --> 48:17.440
the sport could strengthen people in those ways.

48:17.440 --> 48:21.160
So he was married to it.

48:21.160 --> 48:25.160
And he was old and he needed,

48:25.160 --> 48:26.920
there was no one in the gym.

48:26.920 --> 48:27.760
It was empty.

48:28.720 --> 48:31.960
And it was above a police station, which was crazy.

48:31.960 --> 48:36.080
And he needed an heir to the throne.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.720
He needed to pass it on to someone.

48:38.720 --> 48:40.400
And he saw something.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.760
And all of a sudden he saw that my career as a boxer

48:43.760 --> 48:47.240
was less important than having me become his heir

48:47.240 --> 48:50.240
to the throne and become his trainer, his man, his guy,

48:50.240 --> 48:53.760
to continue that we could do a lot more for him

48:53.760 --> 48:57.600
and for everyone, not just for him, but for everyone.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.080
It was more like to keep it going.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.680
Like it couldn't die.

49:01.680 --> 49:02.520
It couldn't die.

49:02.520 --> 49:04.840
And his cousin was afraid that it would die with him.

49:04.840 --> 49:06.200
And he committed his whole life to it.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.960
He didn't get married because of boxing.

49:07.960 --> 49:12.960
So he saw me as the little bit of the seed to plant

49:17.640 --> 49:22.640
for more things to grow before that plant died.

49:22.760 --> 49:26.760
And so he, all of a sudden he says, you can't fight.

49:26.760 --> 49:29.800
And I had people tell me that I could go

49:29.800 --> 49:31.480
somewhere else and fight.

49:31.480 --> 49:36.480
And I could, but I couldn't because I'd be disloyal.

49:36.720 --> 49:37.840
Loyalty is everything.

49:37.840 --> 49:40.000
Yeah, so I couldn't leave Cuss.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.320
And he kind of knew that.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.040
And so, I couldn't leave him.

49:44.040 --> 49:46.760
And he said, you have an ability to teach.

49:46.760 --> 49:48.960
He said, knowledge means nothing.

49:50.040 --> 49:51.600
He said, see these prokaryotes,

49:51.600 --> 49:55.880
he had prokaryotic, prokaryotic encyclopedias,

49:55.920 --> 49:57.960
the whole set in our library.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.320
He said, you see these?

49:59.320 --> 50:00.760
Yeah, I see them.

50:00.760 --> 50:04.040
All the knowledge of the world, whatever, is in these.

50:04.040 --> 50:05.040
All right.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.960
Means nothing if you don't have somebody

50:07.960 --> 50:10.360
to convey it to people.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.920
Otherwise it just sits on a bookshelf and looks good.

50:12.920 --> 50:14.680
He goes, you have the ability

50:14.680 --> 50:16.120
to convey knowledge to people.

50:16.120 --> 50:17.280
You're a teacher.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.320
You were born to be a teacher.

50:19.320 --> 50:22.680
You'd lessen yourself by only being a champion fighter

50:22.680 --> 50:25.000
because you'd only take care of one person.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.600
You could take care of all kinds of people.

50:27.600 --> 50:29.520
And you could do this and you could do that

50:29.520 --> 50:30.360
and you could do this.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.840
So, we go on this venture, took a minute

50:32.840 --> 50:34.880
because I didn't believe him at first.

50:34.880 --> 50:39.120
But finally, I am, I'm there, I'm training fighters.

50:40.280 --> 50:44.040
And then he gets me to buy in.

50:45.280 --> 50:49.320
And I was a teacher and I start teaching these kids

50:49.320 --> 50:51.320
and there's no one in the gym, it's dead.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.800
And all of a sudden there's 10 kids,

50:52.840 --> 50:57.840
15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, Catskill Boxing Club,

50:58.160 --> 51:00.200
which was never there.

51:00.200 --> 51:01.400
Now it's there.

51:01.400 --> 51:02.920
And I'm training fighters.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.240
I'm taking them down to South Bronx to get experience.

51:05.240 --> 51:07.400
One of his former fighters, Nelson Cuervas,

51:07.400 --> 51:08.480
down to South Bronx.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.120
I'm taking them down there to get smokers,

51:10.120 --> 51:11.960
to get fights when they're ready.

51:11.960 --> 51:13.400
I'm wearing out dungarees.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.720
I'm getting holes in my dungarees.

51:14.720 --> 51:17.200
I was fashionable before it was fashionable

51:17.200 --> 51:18.920
to have holes in my dungarees.

51:18.920 --> 51:20.920
I could have made a lot of money with that

51:20.960 --> 51:23.040
because I was on my knees with these little kids,

51:23.040 --> 51:26.560
nine years old, 10 years old, eight years old,

51:26.560 --> 51:30.000
12, 13, 14, all these kids.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.520
And I'm teaching them and I'm building a gym.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.400
And Cus only came once a week

51:34.400 --> 51:36.680
because he was semi-retired.

51:36.680 --> 51:39.040
And when he would come once a week,

51:39.040 --> 51:40.600
he knew he couldn't give me money,

51:40.600 --> 51:42.120
but he gave me more than money.

51:42.120 --> 51:43.240
He gave me praise.

51:44.800 --> 51:47.360
And he said, look what Atlas is doing.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.720
He's creating champions.

51:49.720 --> 51:54.280
And I was like, whoa, yeah, wow, I'm doing good.

51:54.280 --> 51:58.000
And then all of a sudden after four years of that,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.040
because I was up there seven years, eight years, eight years,

52:01.040 --> 52:03.520
after about three and a half, four years of that,

52:03.520 --> 52:06.280
we get a phone call that they get this kid in prison

52:06.280 --> 52:10.360
and try on prison from one of the guys that knew Cus,

52:10.360 --> 52:15.360
Matt Baranski, and there's a correctional officer

52:15.680 --> 52:18.200
named Bobby Stewart who used a box,

52:18.200 --> 52:20.920
and Cus had helped him out a little bit, a little bit.

52:20.920 --> 52:24.240
And they knew we had this gym now

52:24.240 --> 52:26.600
that was really starting to become something

52:26.600 --> 52:29.120
because we were winning tournaments and everything else.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.520
They're calling over, we got this kid, Mike Tyson,

52:31.520 --> 52:35.800
he's 12 years old, he's 190 pounds, he's a mess.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.840
But Bobby Stewart got involved with him,

52:39.080 --> 52:42.240
the former fighter, and he's taken a liking to it.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.360
And now where he didn't behave at all

52:44.360 --> 52:46.720
and he didn't listen to anyone, now he's listening

52:46.760 --> 52:48.120
because Bobby's got a carrot,

52:48.120 --> 52:50.160
and the carrot is his teacher boxing,

52:50.160 --> 52:52.560
and now he's at the point now

52:52.560 --> 52:55.480
where we want you to take a look, you and Teddy.

52:55.480 --> 52:57.120
All right, bring him down.

52:57.120 --> 53:00.080
What did you think when you first saw Mike Tyson?

53:00.080 --> 53:02.960
Well, I wanted to see his birth certificate

53:02.960 --> 53:06.760
because he's 190 pounds, 12 years old, and all solid.

53:06.760 --> 53:07.600
Yeah.

53:08.600 --> 53:09.440
Really?

53:09.440 --> 53:10.280
But yeah.

53:10.280 --> 53:14.280
Just physically, just as a physical specimen and big guy.

53:14.320 --> 53:19.320
Yeah, and listen, Cus was right, I was a teacher.

53:19.720 --> 53:20.920
He was right.

53:20.920 --> 53:23.080
And he was testing me even that day.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.320
He said, what do you think?

53:24.320 --> 53:26.720
So I said, well, we ain't gonna know nothing in the bag.

53:26.720 --> 53:27.880
Who the freak cares about that?

53:27.880 --> 53:29.840
He knocked the bag down.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.240
We gotta put him in with,

53:32.240 --> 53:33.560
we got no one to put him in that way.

53:33.560 --> 53:35.160
I didn't have anyone that way.

53:35.160 --> 53:36.360
We gotta test him.

53:36.360 --> 53:37.920
Everyone's gotta be tested.

53:37.920 --> 53:41.320
And so you gotta put him in, responsibly,

53:41.320 --> 53:43.240
but let's put him in, just responsibly,

53:43.240 --> 53:44.720
but let's put him in with Bobby Stewart,

53:44.720 --> 53:47.160
former pro fighter, had 14 pro fights.

53:47.160 --> 53:51.400
Smaller than Tyson, when he was fighting, he was 175,

53:51.400 --> 53:52.960
but still, he's 28 years old.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.760
Tyson's 12, come on.

53:54.760 --> 53:57.760
And he'll work with him, right?

53:57.760 --> 53:59.160
So we do, we put him on.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.480
Tyson, he recognized the moment.

54:01.480 --> 54:03.600
He understood this was an audition.

54:03.600 --> 54:04.960
This was a chance.

54:06.360 --> 54:09.280
This was that TV show, Change Your Life.

54:09.280 --> 54:13.040
And he understood that if he passed the audition,

54:13.840 --> 54:16.200
possibly change his life, he wasn't sure what.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.160
How could he be sure what, exactly?

54:18.160 --> 54:20.320
But it was better than what he had.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.680
And so he was on audition.

54:22.680 --> 54:25.200
He wanted, he innately understood

54:25.200 --> 54:27.840
what we would wanna see.

54:27.840 --> 54:32.320
Ferociousness, toughness, character,

54:32.320 --> 54:35.720
desire, you know, and of course, ability.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.200
Well, we saw the ability.

54:37.200 --> 54:40.880
Power, speed, but it was unbridled.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.120
It was untoward, it was raw.

54:43.120 --> 54:47.400
He didn't know really much at all, at all.

54:47.400 --> 54:50.200
But we saw that.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.680
But he wanted to show more.

54:51.680 --> 54:52.840
He knew that wasn't enough.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.160
Again, innate intelligence.

54:55.160 --> 54:59.520
He had to show desire, he had to show toughness.

54:59.520 --> 55:02.360
And so I was being responsible.

55:02.360 --> 55:03.760
After two rounds, that's enough.

55:03.760 --> 55:05.480
Normally, I don't put a guy into boxing

55:05.480 --> 55:07.440
until maybe four months, five months, six months,

55:07.440 --> 55:09.480
eight months, 10 months, it depends what it takes

55:09.520 --> 55:11.880
to learn on the floor before it's responsible

55:11.880 --> 55:15.040
to put him in a ring to actually take on

55:16.360 --> 55:20.320
incoming real live shows instead of blanks.

55:20.320 --> 55:24.040
And so normally, I wouldn't have him in.

55:24.040 --> 55:26.320
And I knew after today, he wouldn't be in the ring again

55:26.320 --> 55:27.160
if I trained him.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.200
I would teach him first,

55:28.200 --> 55:30.440
and then he'd get back in in a few months.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.840
But for this day, it was the only way.

55:34.960 --> 55:37.680
It's kinda like, I used to make this analogy,

55:37.680 --> 55:38.680
and Cuss loved it.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.480
He said, what's training a fighter?

55:40.480 --> 55:43.200
What do you look for in training a fighter, Teddy?

55:43.200 --> 55:46.160
He asked me these ridiculous questions just to test me.

55:46.160 --> 55:48.800
And I say, it's like going to Macy's window.

55:48.800 --> 55:49.640
He loved it.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.880
I said, it's like going to Macy's window on Christmas.

55:52.880 --> 55:54.480
He goes, what do you mean, Macy's window?

55:54.480 --> 55:56.400
Cuss was like, boom, boom, boom.

55:56.400 --> 55:57.600
So what do you mean, Macy's window?

55:57.600 --> 55:58.720
Oh, you go to Macy's window,

55:58.720 --> 56:00.600
and they got the window with everything you wanna see,

56:00.600 --> 56:03.800
everything in there, and it looks great, everything.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.640
And yeah, and then what?

56:05.640 --> 56:08.560
Well, then you ask what's in the warehouse,

56:09.440 --> 56:10.280
and they tell you nothing.

56:10.280 --> 56:13.360
And Cuss says, that's it.

56:14.280 --> 56:15.880
That's a trainer.

56:15.880 --> 56:18.080
And I wanted to see what was in the warehouse,

56:19.040 --> 56:21.120
because I saw what was in Macy's window.

56:21.120 --> 56:22.560
I saw the power, I saw the speed.

56:22.560 --> 56:25.560
So he goes two rounds, and he gets a bloody nose.

56:25.560 --> 56:29.000
Here's the weird thing, not weird, very telling.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.160
We knew what we were doing.

56:30.160 --> 56:31.840
Not bragging, but we knew what we were doing,

56:31.840 --> 56:34.920
because he got a bloody nose because he got hit.

56:35.880 --> 56:37.160
After that bloody nose,

56:37.160 --> 56:38.800
he never got another bloody nose.

56:38.800 --> 56:39.640
You know why?

56:39.640 --> 56:41.680
He didn't get hit, because he learned.

56:41.680 --> 56:44.640
He was still strong, but he was smarter now.

56:44.640 --> 56:47.680
Anyway, he goes two rounds, and I saw,

56:47.680 --> 56:48.720
and I'm being responsible,

56:48.720 --> 56:50.960
because if he goes more, it's not responsible.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.880
I saw what I needed to see.

56:52.880 --> 56:55.960
I saw speed, I saw power, I saw athleticism,

56:55.960 --> 56:58.000
and I saw, I didn't believe him.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.400
I thought he was lying to me.

56:59.400 --> 57:00.320
I'm just telling you.

57:00.320 --> 57:02.200
I thought he was lying, trying to act tough

57:02.200 --> 57:03.600
when he wasn't really feeling tough.

57:03.600 --> 57:04.800
It didn't matter.

57:05.680 --> 57:07.400
Cuss questioned me on it afterwards.

57:07.400 --> 57:08.520
What did you see?

57:08.520 --> 57:11.040
And when I said it, he goes, young master.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.320
Again, he wasn't paying me money,

57:13.320 --> 57:15.160
so he had to give me something, right?

57:15.160 --> 57:17.560
And that was better than, that was currency.

57:17.560 --> 57:19.440
Young master, I'm the young master.

57:19.440 --> 57:22.280
Whoa, young master, you know what I mean?

57:22.280 --> 57:25.600
I felt like that guy Kung Fu, like in the movie,

57:25.600 --> 57:27.480
like Kung Fu, grasshopper, when you're ready,

57:27.480 --> 57:29.960
when you can take this out of my hand, you can leave.

57:29.960 --> 57:30.800
And-

57:30.800 --> 57:31.640
That's powerful.

57:31.640 --> 57:32.480
Yeah, it was.

57:32.480 --> 57:33.720
It worked.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.960
And he did, and it worked.

57:36.960 --> 57:40.000
And so, but you know what?

57:40.000 --> 57:42.040
I didn't mind being worked.

57:42.040 --> 57:45.560
I kind of knew I was being shuffled a little bit.

57:45.560 --> 57:48.440
Well, you're making it sound a little bit negative,

57:48.440 --> 57:50.560
but it's also extremely positive.

57:50.560 --> 57:53.960
That's a teacher instilling wisdom into you

57:53.960 --> 57:56.640
that you carried forward and impacted a lot of people.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.960
Yeah, Cuss got the job done, but he did it his way.

57:59.960 --> 58:03.120
And he did it for a myriad of reasons,

58:03.680 --> 58:05.800
but at the end of the day, it was all good.

58:05.800 --> 58:10.800
And I just had to understand that eventually later on, but-

58:11.160 --> 58:12.000
And you do the same.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.960
You do things your way and carry some of him in you,

58:14.960 --> 58:15.960
some of your father in you.

58:15.960 --> 58:19.920
Yeah, that day, you know, that day was funny

58:19.920 --> 58:24.640
because when Cuss said, what did you see, Teddy, with him?

58:24.640 --> 58:26.240
After two rounds, I got up in the ring.

58:26.240 --> 58:27.800
I knew I was gonna train him.

58:27.800 --> 58:30.160
Obviously, we weren't gonna say no.

58:30.160 --> 58:32.880
And he still had about four months to serve,

58:33.680 --> 58:35.120
and we were gonna work it out.

58:35.120 --> 58:39.840
And when I got up on the ring apron, that's my gym.

58:39.840 --> 58:40.760
I'm the boss.

58:41.760 --> 58:43.760
You know, people later on in life call me a dictator.

58:43.760 --> 58:44.600
You know what I said?

58:44.600 --> 58:45.760
Yeah, you're right.

58:45.760 --> 58:48.920
I didn't deny people thought, you mean I'm right?

58:48.920 --> 58:50.120
Yeah, I'm a dictator.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.000
I'm a trainer.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.080
I'm the boss.

58:52.080 --> 58:53.200
I'm in charge.

58:53.200 --> 58:55.280
If I, you wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

58:55.280 --> 58:56.440
What the freak you need me for

58:56.440 --> 58:58.240
if I'm not freaking in charge?

58:58.240 --> 58:59.360
You idiot.

58:59.360 --> 59:00.720
Yeah, damn right.

59:01.320 --> 59:02.800
Well, what do you think?

59:02.800 --> 59:04.280
It's a shared responsibility?

59:04.280 --> 59:05.880
No, it's my responsibility.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.000
That's why you're here.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.200
Yeah, I am in charge.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.800
You shouldn't be here if you don't understand that.

59:11.800 --> 59:15.080
So I get up there and I know that I'm gonna be training him.

59:15.080 --> 59:17.000
I gotta show him who the boss is.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.480
You know, I'm being really frank about this.

59:19.480 --> 59:21.920
So I get up there and I say, that's it, out.

59:23.480 --> 59:25.400
No, no, you know, this is Tyson.

59:25.400 --> 59:26.240
No, let me go.

59:26.240 --> 59:27.320
I wanna do another round.

59:27.320 --> 59:28.440
I wanna do another one.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.440
I said out.

59:30.440 --> 59:31.880
Did you hear what I said?

59:31.880 --> 59:34.160
Because I knew that, you know, he was gonna test me.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.000
He was testing me.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.200
I said, I said, get out.

59:38.400 --> 59:39.400
Then he got out.

59:39.400 --> 59:40.600
But were you impressed with the fact

59:40.600 --> 59:42.120
that you wanna keep going or not?

59:42.120 --> 59:45.040
Yes, and I recognized what it really was.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.120
So Cus asked me, what was that?

59:47.120 --> 59:49.080
Cus wanted to know what the young master saw.

59:49.080 --> 59:50.400
So Cus said, what was that?

59:51.560 --> 59:56.160
I said it was, it was an act.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.000
He goes, you saw that?

59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.800
Did he really wanna go?

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.880
I said, no.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.280
I said, he didn't really wanna go.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.120
But he knew that we want him to go

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.960
and he made himself ready to go in order to satisfy.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.320
And that's just as good.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.760
And Cus said, damn right, it's just as good.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.760
All that matters was not how he got there,

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.840
but that he got there.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.000
That's all that matters, that he got there,

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.440
that he got to the place to act like a fighter,

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.520
to do what we want him to do,

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.400
to be ready to persevere, to go beyond the comfort level,

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.600
to do another round.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.320
He didn't want to, damn right he didn't want to.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.520
But he knew we want him to,

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:43.200
and he knew in order to pass the test, he had to do it.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.960
And he said, you're right.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.840
He goes, now it's gonna be your job to teach him

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.080
to make him a fighter that don't get bloody noses,

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:56.400
that don't get hit, and will get to that place

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.160
without being coerced to get there,

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.960
to get to that place on his own

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.520
instead of using the things that he had to use

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.560
to get to that place today.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.400
Those things are not going to be available one day

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.600
when you, and listen to this,

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.640
you talk about a man being prophetic,

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.120
Cus was pretty good,

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.200
you talk about man being on a job, on money, Lex,

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.560
he says, how do you think he finishes the sentence?

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.480
Because someday, because you're gonna have to make sure

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.040
that he learns these things,

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.560
because he'll be your first heavyweight champ.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.680
What did you just say?

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.840
He's 12 years old.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.760
He's been arrested 30 times.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:47.080
He's getting out of jail, out of juvenile detention, try on.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.520
He's a mess in a lot of ways.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.200
There's a lot of things we find out later,

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.440
a lot of problems, weaknesses.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.880
He goes, and that's part of your job.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.560
That'll be part of your job.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.840
But he really said that.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.960
And then he turned to him, he goes,

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.560
you wanna come live with us, young man?

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.560
You wanna be a fighter?

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.400
Yes.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.880
Even that, Cus said to me later,

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.720
what do you think about that?

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.560
I said, he ain't gonna be.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.400
The way he said yes.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.560
Yeah, the way he said yes.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.040
Yeah, yes, sir.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.680
He said, what do you think about that?

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.920
And we're talking, I said,

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.440
ain't gonna be that polite

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.640
in a little while down the road.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.840
Again, he knew that that's what he felt

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.680
that he needed to project himself as,

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.440
to present himself as, to get to where he wanna get to.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.720
He goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.960
Did you see what Cus was seeing

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.040
in terms of the heavyweight champion of the world?

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:42.880
No.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.840
Again, the easiest answer would be yes.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.880
Teddy's just, Teddy Allen's a genius.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.040
Wow, wow.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.640
Teddy's, wow, right?

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.480
No, no, no, no.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.520
But again, it was my job.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:59.520
And I just, my job, it was simple, simpler than Cus's.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.800
Cus knew too much.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.640
I knew nothing.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.640
I just knew, you know, rudiments of boxing,

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.040
I knew what it took to be a fighter

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.760
and how to execute it, the steps of executing it.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.320
So I took those steps.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.280
The rest of it, you get blurred by those other things.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.200
I wasn't blurred by those other things.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.980
It was just, get him in the gym,

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.740
make him mentally stronger, make him face things,

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.100
and teach him how to slip punches.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.740
And create holes and fill those freaking holes

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.660
with devastating punches, this is Cus.

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.220
And what are you gonna do?

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.940
I'm gonna teach him to fill holes

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.460
and fill them with punches with bad intentions.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.700
And that became the moniker.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.580
And Tyson would say that.

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.700
I'm telling punches with bad intentions.

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:46.540
Yes, you are.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.620
And, you know.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.180
How do you make him mentally tougher?

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.300
So that part of the job.

01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.980
You said don't get a bloody nose,

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.020
but the part of the job where it makes him mentally tougher.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.260
How do you do that?

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:01.060
Most important part of the job, to make him face things.

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.020
Make him face where he's lying to himself,

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.380
where he's submitting.

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:08.220
When we start this conversation with submission,

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:13.220
submit less, submit less, submit less every day, submit less.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.300
Cus only comes to the gym once in a while.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.940
And if I had him spawn, he would come,

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:20.340
because that was his project, that was the heavyweight.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.740
Now he came, you know, put life in Cus.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:25.220
Cus had life, he was losing a little life.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.380
But that made the light bulb bright again, it did.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.300
And it was great to see, I felt proud of that.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.860
I felt connected to that.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:35.180
And that's why when it all went bad,

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:38.660
and Cus took the side that the only side he could take,

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.220
the side of the next heavyweight champ in the world.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:46.220
But he left me, his partner, the young master.

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:50.300
And that was the second time I get betrayed.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:55.300
And I'm like, for a while I thought everything,

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.700
Cus taught me, said to me, I was a liar,

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:01.180
I didn't want to be any part of it anymore.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.620
Until I got a little more mature,

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.060
and I got a little past that,

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:09.060
where I was able to understand

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:16.820
that just because so many that you perceive this great

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:26.660
in every area is you find to be weak in certain areas,

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:33.500
doesn't mean that they can't still be what they want to you.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:37.300
It's something that,

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.940
it's something that can be understood or forgiven.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:44.940
It's hard, it's hard to get to that place

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.940
and forgive somebody in that kind of way

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.700
that I felt betrayed.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.820
Because Cus told me the most important thing was loyalty.

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.820
Cus told me he loved me because I was loyal.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:58.260
Cus told people that the reason that he went to court

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:00.780
was because I didn't give up anybody,

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.700
even though it meant putting me in the risk

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.700
of going to jail for 10 years.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.700
And Cus felt that he admired those traits.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:12.700
And so I assumed that he would show the same traits.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:16.020
And he took a deal.

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:18.540
He took a deal, he took a deal.

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:22.500
He signed the papers that those so-called friends of mine

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.780
signed, he took a deal to,

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:29.220
to have the future heavyweight champions to turn down

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:34.220
and to let me go, to sign the deal,

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:39.020
to let me take the weight.

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.580
For people who don't know,

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.700
Mike was inappropriate with a young girl

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.340
and you pulled the gun on him.

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.340
And he was like, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:51.340
And Mike was like, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.340
And he was like, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.480
He was inappropriate with the young girl

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.900
and you pulled the gun on him.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.260
I don't know if there is deeper things to say

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.180
about that situation.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:06.100
But why do you think Cus made the decision to cut you off

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.460
from both Mike Tyson and from Costamato?

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.180
Like to break that,

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.020
when he valued loyalty so.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:14.340
I served my purpose.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.760
I got him to the way he needed to get.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.140
Brought life back in the gym.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:23.220
If I wasn't in the gym at that particular time,

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.140
Tyson never would have been in the gym.

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.300
There would have been no gym to bring him to.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.000
When they called up and made that phone call

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.460
to bring him to the gym, there would have been no activity.

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.020
There would have been no boxing program.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:37.100
There would have been no trainer training him 24-7

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.540
the way I was, where a customer wasn't capable of doing that

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.300
at that point in his life.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.380
But then again, it's not poor Teddy.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.740
I get the benefit of a career.

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.020
I get the benefit of knowledge.

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:48.700
I get the benefit of a life.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.060
I get the benefit of learning,

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.680
of becoming hopefully a better person.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.740
I get the benefit of being betrayed again.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.740
But-

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:02.140
That's a hell of a statement right there.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.140
I don't know what the benefit of that is.

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.980
You can learn to forgive weakness.

01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:18.020
When you realize how easy it is to be weak,

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:24.580
and when you realize that,

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:25.420
somebody asked me,

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:29.340
how did you get to the point where you could forgive?

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:32.100
It's a pretty good question, pretty simple, pretty basic,

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.800
pretty important, right?

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.300
And I didn't understand I understood,

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.360
but I did understand immediately for me.

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:45.500
I said, how can I not forgive somebody?

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:49.540
It becomes easier to learn how to forgive

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.960
when you're still trying to forgive yourself,

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.960
when you're still in the process of trying

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:03.960
to forgive yourself for all your own inherent weaknesses

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.020
and betrayals of people like my father

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.740
in different ways that we forget very easily

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:14.800
because it's handy and it's a way of surviving.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:19.340
It's a lot easier to figure it out,

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:24.180
to rationalize it, to find forgiveness

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:28.040
when you realize that you still haven't figured out

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.820
completely how to forgive yourself.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.980
I'm still trying to figure that out.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:42.340
So that helped me figure out how to forgive CUSS

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.500
because to figure out how to forgive me,

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.940
I had to understood why I did these things,

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:49.820
where the weaknesses came from,

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.460
where the selfishness came from,

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.180
where the convenience came from,

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:58.060
that they really existed, but they didn't exist for malice.

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:04.980
They existed for me not being prepared to understand

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:09.980
that I could be stronger, to wanna be stronger.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:13.840
And then I looked at CUSS, he wanted to be stronger,

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:16.940
but he got to a point in life where he had been strong

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.620
for a lot of his life, he was strong with me,

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.920
he was strong with a lot of things in his life.

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.740
And does everyone deserve a passing life

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:30.980
where he got to a place where everything was in one basket,

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.580
the basket of boxing, he once told me

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.260
that he never got married

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:41.680
because it would have been selfish to a woman

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.620
to have gotten married when his whole life was boxing,

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.220
that he couldn't give to a kid, he couldn't give to her,

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:50.180
he couldn't, and then I thought about it,

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.220
he had no money really,

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:55.980
and Jim Jacobs and Bill Kayden took care of the bills,

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.140
so he didn't really need money that way,

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:02.260
but what was the payoff for that kind of life,

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:05.860
that kind of commitment, that kind of sacrifice?

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.740
Really, what was the payoff?

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.880
The payoff was to have champions,

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:16.020
to have a champion that would keep your name alive,

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.440
that word legacy, like what does it mean?

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.240
Sometimes it's just a word,

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.240
sometimes it's more than a word, it's a reprieve,

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.240
it's a pension plan, it's being given a pension

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.200
on your way out for the rest of your life,

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.560
for your life, wherever you're going,

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.280
you're going to wherever you're going for eternity,

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:46.040
it's the only thing that you take with you,

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.800
is what you left behind, and for Cuss,

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.540
it was all about leaving behind a mark,

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:56.360
a mark of champion, yeah it was attached to ego,

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.360
we all have it, yeah it was attached

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.760
to some selfishness and all,

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.560
but yeah it was also attached to wanting

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.700
to leave something great behind,

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.380
to know that you were part of it,

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.620
that you existed for a reason,

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.220
that you sacrificed for a reason,

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:20.080
and all that freaking pain I brought my father,

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.300
I was searching for something,

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.820
yeah I made it into a righteous search,

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:28.500
I made it into, I did, and I made it into,

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.500
it was okay because it was righteous,

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.500
but it still did damage, it still did damage,

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.380
it still hurt people, it still betrayed my father's trust,

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:45.860
and Cuss betrayed mine, but he didn't do it maliciously,

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.540
he did it out of, again,

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.600
my father came home, this is how I'm going to connect it,

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.820
my father came home from work one night at 12 o'clock

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:03.520
and I was waiting on him, and like I said,

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.820
I was over nine, 10 years old, and he got mad at me,

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.160
he goes, go to bed, what are you doing up?

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.060
I said, I'm waiting for you, waiting for you,

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:15.580
and he said, well go to bed, I said, no,

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:20.580
I, what were you doing, I said, I was at the hospital,

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.260
you were there, why were you there so late?

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.860
He answered me, he said, there was a patient,

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:32.340
there was a sick patient, I said, he must be better now,

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:35.260
because you're his doctor, because my father

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:38.780
could fix anything, and my father,

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:42.660
nothing got in the way of the truth, nothing, nothing,

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.580
even blowing his son's bubble,

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:49.120
matter of factly, he said to me,

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.940
no, he's not going to get better, he's going to die,

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.900
and so as a nine year old kid, you're a kid, you're selfish,

01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:03.940
not in a bad way, but you want what you,

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.980
and I said, I said two things, first I said,

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:15.300
how, how, you're his doctor, how, it can't be,

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.580
and then I said, I just said it almost angry,

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.180
then why were you there, like you should have

01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:24.820
been here with me, and you know what he said to me,

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:29.480
because you don't give up on life, go to bed,

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.120
and I finally connected the dots, this idiot,

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.640
that didn't graduate high school,

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.800
I finally connected the dots,

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.880
I was asking Custer to give up on life,

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.480
you know, you don't give up on life,

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.640
you don't give up on aspirations of life,

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.800
life is all forms of life, doesn't have to be

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.200
a physical form of it, it's life,

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.960
it's having a reason to be alive,

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.320
it's having a reason to have tomorrow,

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:09.280
and Custer's only reason to have tomorrow

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.000
was to have another heavyweight champ,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.520
and Teddy Atlas, even though we were together

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.600
all those years, and we were partners,

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.800
and we trained together, and we would,

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:20.920
we would, you know, the only thing we didn't do

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.880
was what they did in the Indian movies,

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.040
where they cut the finger and they became blood brothers,

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.160
that's the only thing we didn't do,

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.960
and I felt like we did that, without cutting,

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.400
and now here we are, and he freaking betrayed me,

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.040
and then all of a sudden I connected the dots,

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:45.040
I was like, he didn't betray me in that cold sense,

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.440
he didn't give up on life.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.520
Years later, Mike Tyson apologized to you,

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.520
what's meaningful to you about that,

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.080
how does that fit the story?

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.800
I wanna be the great, gracious guy right now,

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.800
say, oh, I'm so human, that, you know,

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.080
a man's man enough to say, sorry, that's it, we're good,

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:22.120
I wanna be really, that's the best presentation

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.720
of Teddy Atlas I could put out there, he's a good guy,

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.920
he forgives, he's a good guy, he's a stand-up guy,

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.760
and he's a good guy, I'm not sure.

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.920
If he truly did it for himself, that he really did it

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.800
because he felt that,

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.040
it was true, but if he's persuaded by other things,

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.040
he was in the middle, I know I'm taking it too deep,

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.600
I know it, but what am I gonna do?

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.320
He was in the middle of 12 steps with the, you know,

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.320
getting out of drugs, alcohol, 12 steps,

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.000
which is a commemorable thing, really, it is,

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.960
and he's taking the steps, and part of the steps

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.360
was to admit or to apologize to all people

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.200
you offended in life, okay,

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.680
but are you doing it for the 12 steps,

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.080
or are you doing it because you really, truly

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.680
have come to terms with believing what you did

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:32.320
was that hurtful to me, and that it matters to you

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.920
that it was that hurtful to me,

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:35.520
and that you were wrong in doing it,

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.240
did you do it for, and I know that's deep,

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.760
I know that I'm a freaking idiot,

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:44.280
you're a Teddy, freaking, you should be better than that,

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.120
he's better than you, yeah, maybe he is better than me,

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.920
maybe he is, really, seriously, maybe he is,

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:55.080
and I took it, he put his hand, I took it, we hugged,

01:17:55.080 --> 01:18:00.080
he said, I love you, yeah, yeah, but I wanna believe,

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.040
but what did Cuss tell me?

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.960
No matter what a man says, it's what he does in the end

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.360
that he intended to do all along,

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:16.600
so to this day, today, was it really genuine,

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.440
or was it reflexive of that moment for him

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:24.000
to get what he needed for that step,

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.560
or was it truly for what I needed,

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.640
that he really cared that what he did to me

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:37.080
caused me to do what I did,

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.880
because I did something that was pretty damn bad to him too,

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.360
is he able to deal with that,

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.960
and put that where it has to be put,

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:51.520
is he able to put that, or is it just,

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.720
he did something he had to do and maybe he's sorry he did it,

01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:00.720
I know, look, I appreciated that he,

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.040
I would have rather been in a private place.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:06.200
Yeah, so what people don't know,

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.320
you were in the middle of commentating a fight,

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.080
and he walked up behind you and he said he was sorry,

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.240
he shook your hand, gave you a hug,

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:15.800
I didn't know he said, I love you.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.600
Yeah, he's emotional, I get emotional a little bit too,

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.800
but he's emotional and he can be,

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.440
and he can be, I can see why people have a fascination

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.800
and a love affair with him right now,

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.320
because he was, because he was,

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.280
he was the meteor, the meteor that went across the sky,

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.000
that is, if they didn't see it,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.240
their parents told them about it,

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.520
there was a meteor that came across the sky one day,

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.320
and the meteor's walking around in the room now,

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.520
and that's the meteorite, and then it actually landed here,

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.240
and that's it right there,

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.160
and now he's come a long way,

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:58.160
and now he's more human and he's lovable and compassionate

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:04.840
and he cries, and I get the fascination,

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:07.000
I get the love affair, I get it,

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.960
because we're inherently, we're people that wanna forgive,

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.560
we're people that, we wanna be good,

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.920
and part of being good is to forgive people

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.440
and to show compassion to people,

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:21.880
and so, and when somebody's been damaged,

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.800
to acknowledge they've been damaged,

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.280
to acknowledge that you know they've been damaged

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.000
and you care about them being damaged,

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.720
and how do you show care?

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:36.720
Through admiration, in some ways, almost through adulation,

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.920
and he's getting adulation from people,

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:43.080
like, which is to an incredible level,

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.920
and it's because, it's a phenomena,

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.520
but I get it, I understand it,

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.240
and I don't know if he gets it,

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.520
I don't know if underneath all of this,

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.640
he's a complex guy, he's a sensitive guy,

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.080
I don't know, and I am too.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.920
One complex guy talking about another complex guy.

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:06.000
I don't know if underneath it all,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.680
where he's really truly at,

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.720
as far as that day that he said that to me.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.280
Is there part of you that's sorry to Mike,

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:17.480
for pulling the gun on him?

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:19.760
Yeah, and that's, listen, that's fair,

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.360
I know dimensions of human nature too well,

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.520
to not know that he still has to have certain,

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.680
because I have those strong feelings,

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.560
what, it's not fair for him to have them?

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.640
Damn right it's fair.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.760
Now, he could look at it if he was to be held

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.560
to his word that night, that he just acknowledges

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.920
that what happened he deserved,

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:48.520
because of what he, the position he put me in,

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.080
and he put himself in, what he did,

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:54.320
and I wouldn't change nothing.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.240
You don't regret pulling the gun on him?

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.280
I regret that I had to.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:04.680
Yeah, I regret very much that I had to,

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.880
that I regret very much.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.200
He crossed the line.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.720
I hated him for putting me in that position.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:16.720
That, you know, how dare he think that somebody's feelings

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.880
are that trivial?

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.880
That the way I would feel about myself,

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.040
and the way the girl would feel about herself,

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.640
when I was 11 years old at the time,

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.240
how she would feel about herself,

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.640
how dare he think it's that trivial that, you know,

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.760
that I shouldn't be ready to freaking,

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.360
to both die and kill for that.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.760
Why didn't Custamato see it in a deeper way,

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.520
and talk through it?

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.480
The word came back to me, but of course, what does it mean?

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.320
But the word came back to me that Cust said you were right,

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.440
but if he took the side of Teddy,

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:59.280
he would destroy potentially a great fighter.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.200
Why do you think that, okay,

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.040
if you were to try to understand the point he was making,

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.680
why is that true?

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.520
Isn't the part of greatness that you said

01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:11.840
is building the character of knowing what is right?

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:16.320
Cust was afraid to go there where he used to not be afraid,

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:21.000
because it's kind of like you're never afraid of going up.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.120
I get it, you know, when I train a fighter now,

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:26.680
if I come out every time and I train a fighter now,

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.520
I feel in camp like I'm,

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.960
I feel like I'm on death row every day,

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:38.240
that if every day I try to retrace my memory and say,

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.800
did I feel this way when I was younger?

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.560
I don't remember feeling this way.

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.440
I feel every day a dreadful feeling

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.840
that if I don't get this right, I betrayed everything.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.520
I betrayed the fighter's trust.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.200
I betrayed what I'm supposed to be.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.360
And then one day I tried to figure it out.

01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:56.680
Why do I feel this way?

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.040
It's so intense.

01:23:58.040 --> 01:23:59.360
I was in camp for two months,

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:03.440
training a guy for the world title a few years ago,

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.160
fighting the hardest puncher in the world at the time,

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:09.920
and Adonis Stevenson, and the fighter was Ukrainian.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.920
And I was brought in to train him for that fight,

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.640
and he trusted me and changed his whole style, trusted me.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:19.200
Oh my God, I went to bed every night like praying,

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:24.600
dread, waking up dread, my stomach down to here,

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.160
saying, what if I fail him?

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.520
What if everything that I told him was gonna happen

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.880
don't happen, what if I fail him?

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.600
What if he trusted me?

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.560
And I betrayed that trust.

01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:40.680
And the thing was, because was,

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.680
he used to be stronger than that.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.800
And then I tried to figure it out why I got this way

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.880
and why it was so dreadful to me

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.000
and why I felt like I was on death row every day

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.960
training a fighter, like, did I do enough?

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.800
Did I do right?

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.400
Well, will we accomplish what we,

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.560
will we accomplish what I promised we would accomplish?

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:02.960
Would I keep my word?

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.720
And then I started thinking, how did I become this weak?

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.840
How did I freaking become,

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.520
I was a pretty strong freaking guy.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.840
How did I become this weak?

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:13.520
And then finally I think I figured it out, you know why?

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:16.080
Because I was always working to get up.

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.080
Once I finally got up, now I was looking down.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.040
And I finally hit me.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.000
I said, I didn't wanna lose.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.920
I said, there was nothing to lose on my way up.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.360
Now all of a sudden there's something to lose

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.520
when you're up there and you're looking down.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.640
And that's where he was.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.240
And that's where Cuss was.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.280
Cuss was at the end of his rope.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.240
He accomplished two world champs, all this stuff, right?

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:41.320
Everything, and he did it right.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:44.720
Now all of a sudden, it wasn't about moving forward.

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.400
It was about not falling down.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.280
Holy cow.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.360
I was like, I got it, Cuss.

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.680
I got it.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.760
I got it.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.880
You didn't wanna fall down.

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.120
Oh my God.

01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:57.960
You didn't wanna fall.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.280
And he, this was his last chance.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.440
You don't give up on life.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:07.880
This was his last chance to live forever.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.280
To make everything he did worthwhile.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.120
To have the youngest have,

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.280
it wasn't just heavyweight champ.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.520
You gotta remember,

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.080
he was the youngest heavyweight champ ever.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.600
And to have that, it was okay to die now.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.600
And how's loyalty to someone named Teddy Atlas

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.600
gonna get in the way of that?

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.240
That's a tidal wave that there ain't no wall

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.520
that's been made high enough to stop that tidal wave.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.000
And now I'll stop myself.

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.480
Yeah, there is.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.720
But it would have to be an awful big one.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:48.680
And you know what?

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:50.840
Who are we to say that we could ever build

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.160
that wall that big?

01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.240
Who is any of it?

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.360
Who am I to say?

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.160
Do you think if you were to put yourself

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.560
in the shoes of Custom Auto,

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:03.720
can you see yourself having the big enough wall

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.080
or you would choose loyalty?

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:10.000
Now if I answer the way I feel,

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.320
then I'm making myself John Wayne again.

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.840
You don't have to answer that.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.360
I think loyalty is important.

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.520
No matter what a man says,

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:22.560
it's what he does in the end that he intends to do all along.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.000
I didn't make that up, Custod.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.200
And when this all went down,

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:34.160
those words came freaking echoing into my freaking ears.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:35.240
I didn't want them.

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.520
Cotton doesn't help.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.960
And they freaking kept coming into my ears.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:42.960
And what do you think?

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.120
Still an immature kid at the time.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.360
I was young.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.160
Still an immature kid at the time.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.520
What the freak do you think my response was?

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.120
You were full of...

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.480
But I got past that.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:59.920
Do you forgive Cust?

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.360
Have you found forgiveness?

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.200
Listen, I forgive him because

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.120
he gave me more than he took away from me.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.920
If I can, what kind of man am I

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.480
to if I can at least acknowledge that

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.720
and be grateful for that?

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.440
He gave me more than he took from me.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.320
And I'm grateful for that.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.280
I'm also grateful for what I gave him,

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.920
that I did give him something.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And at that point in his life,

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.320
you know,

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.520
a place to still have test tubes

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.160
and chemistry experiments.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:51.720
A laboratory where he could still create great fire.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.560
And I helped give him that.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.560
I was part of that lab and making sure that lab was there

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.480
and just that there was the existence of test tubes.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.480
And a place because you can't freaking do experiments

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:07.440
without test tubes.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.080
Now you're the scientist with the test tubes.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.280
Yeah, I guess so.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.160
And I just hope that...

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.400
What I said earlier is really

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.000
my thread through this whole thing

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.760
when you say, can you forgive Cust?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I'm still trying to forgive myself.

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:38.200
And if I can have hope that I can forgive myself,

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.360
I think that hope has to start

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.560
with the power to forgive someone else.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.560
How can I ever forgive myself for all my failings

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:54.760
and figure it out if I can't start and practice it

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:59.200
by forgiving someone else for some shortcomings?

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:06.160
And for me, that's the only sense of sometimes

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:11.080
a very hard thing to make sense of.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.560
That's my North Star.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:18.640
That's my compass.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.080
Cust used to make me laugh.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.720
You know, me and him did everything together.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.240
We drive and we get lost in the city.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:27.640
We get lost in a problem and he'd get all frustrated.

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.560
And he said, Atlas, you're a great trainer,

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:33.000
but you turn you around, you spin you around

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:33.960
and you're lost.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:36.520
And I said, me or we?

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.640
Because I was the only one who would argue with him.

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.000
And it was really funny sometimes.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.280
And I said, we or me?

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:45.040
You or we?

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:47.240
And he goes, I don't care.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.520
Cust, you're lost.

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:50.680
I'm lost.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.440
What are you talking about?

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.440
And then all of a sudden, Cust couldn't give in.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:55.880
He just couldn't admit.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:56.720
He couldn't give in.

01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.280
You know what he said to me?

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:01.680
All of a sudden he goes, when I was in the army,

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:03.760
if I had a compass, I could get out of the woods.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.120
I said, we're not in the woods.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:05.960
We're not in the army.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.800
We don't have a compass.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:11.800
Cust, Cust, don't argue with me.

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:17.240
One time we're driving, I want to get back to Catskill.

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.440
We just finished at the Bronx.

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.560
It's been a long day, you know,

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.480
visiting the Murderers Inc.'s houses and everything else

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.680
that he took me through for the 1800th time.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.880
And he would fall asleep.

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.120
You know, he was getting older.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.680
And he would just fall asleep in the car.

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.680
So what do you think?

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.120
I went a little faster, right?

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:42.760
Because before he went to sleep, he said, don't speed.

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:45.400
So I don't consider myself,

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.240
I try to be an honest guy and I try to be a freaking,

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:51.000
but yeah, you know.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.280
It was the five or six guys.

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.200
What did I say earlier?

01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.600
Try to do less submitting.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.440
Yeah.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:59.800
Really, in all faces, try to submit a little less.

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.480
Try to lie a little less today.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.280
A little less.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.400
Try to get stronger.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.840
Try to get a little better.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:11.680
So here we are and we're driving.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.240
And all of a sudden he's, what did I do?

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.400
80, 75, probably.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.240
Probably did.

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:19.960
You know, whatever.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.360
And all of a sudden he wakes up.

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.280
You were speeding.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.160
Oh, I lie.

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.000
No, I wasn't.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:31.000
Don't lie.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:32.920
I'm not lying.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:35.680
He lied again.

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.560
You were speeding.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.080
Now, come on.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.880
This guy, he's, you know what I mean?

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.680
He's unbelievable.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:47.360
So I got a freaking, you know, he's David Copperfield.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:48.920
I want to know the trick.

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.080
I want to know how he freaking,

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.560
he made this thing disappear.

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.160
So I said, what are you talking, how do you know?

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.080
He goes, because I timed you.

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:02.720
I looked at the post number and I'm like, what?

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:05.680
I looked at the post number on the side of the road

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.720
where we were, whatever mile,

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.280
and I never knew they even existed.

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.120
I look and I said, yeah, there's little numbers.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.800
You start timing and then fall asleep.

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.160
Yeah, he timed it.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.000
And he looked, he goes,

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.760
I couldn't have got from here to there

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.920
in that amount of time,

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:21.280
unless you were going 75 miles an hour.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.680
And I'm like, all right, I'm a smart man.

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.080
All right, I'm impressed.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:30.760
You know, don't try to get the mile per hour part right.

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.320
It's enough that you got me.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.040
That's enough.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:39.960
Yeah, I said, and I'm not going to do that no more.

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.360
And just, he helped me in crazy ways

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.280
where there would be times where I wanted to be,

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.640
you know, where you wanted to be whatever, right?

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.880
Convenient, weak, submit, right?

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.360
And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden,

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.400
in my mind, CUS was there with the stopwatch.

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:05.400
And I'd be like, you know, no,

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.800
you know, where I was about to say yes

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:13.120
to whatever that particular situation was.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.640
Somebody up there calling.

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.480
Hello?

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:21.680
Hello?

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.080
Yes, you're great.

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:25.920
Thank you.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.520
Just for the record, never had a phone call like this.

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.480
It's hotel security.

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:37.880
The question is, he asked me, is, are you okay, sir?

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:38.920
Are you okay?

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:39.760
Are we okay?

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:41.360
I think so.

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.280
I think so.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.240
So far, you know,

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.640
I can only go like so far.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.480
It's kind of like that old joke, you know,

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.760
where the guy jumps off the Empire State Building,

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.640
falling down, and he's going, you know,

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:56.440
80th floor, 70th floor, 60th floor, 50th,

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.120
and he gets past the 50th floor,

01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.280
and they're looking him out the window,

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.120
and he goes, how am I doing?

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.360
So far, so good.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.680
I don't know where it's going to end, but.

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.160
So Mike Dixon is considered by many

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.520
to be one of the great boxers,

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.520
one of the greatest boxers of all time,

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.040
heavyweight boxers.

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.920
What do you think on the positive side made him great?

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.680
I don't know if he was ever great.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.080
I know he was sensational.

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:29.680
I know he was the greatest mix of maybe speed and power ever.

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.600
I know he was one of the greatest punches

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.960
from either side of the plate, left or right.

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:36.840
There's been great punches with just the right hand,

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:41.720
like Ernie Shavers and Deontay Wilder and Max Bear.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.440
I don't know if there's ever been anyone

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.520
who could punch as good as he did on either side

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:48.960
with either hand, other than Joe Lewis and a few others.

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:51.920
I don't know if there's ever been such a combination

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.200
of speed and power to that pure level that he had,

01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:58.280
and it was a pure level.

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.640
I don't know if there was ever as good a fighter

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.840
as Tyson was where maybe one night he was great,

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.040
where he wasn't tested, but he might've been ready

01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:08.560
to be tested that one night against Michael Spinks

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.160
when he took him apart 90 seconds.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.200
I think I saw a great fighter that night.

01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.840
I don't think you can be great

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:22.840
unless you have all the requirements of being great.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.680
What does it take to be a great fighter, truly great?

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:36.240
To not rely on someone else's weakness to be strong.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.400
To be strong on your own.

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.880
Too often he relied on other people's weakness,

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.560
whether it's by being intimidated or whether it was,

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:50.320
because his talent was so much greater than theirs

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.680
that it was like putting a monster truck in there

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:56.520
with a Volkswagen, and the Volkswagen was gonna get crushed.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:59.400
No matter how much horsepower the Volkswagen

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.080
might've had under the hood and you put under the hood,

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.200
it was gonna get crushed.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.800
The monster truck was not gonna allow it to be a contest,

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:12.800
and to be able to find a way

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.840
when your talent wasn't enough.

01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:19.960
He didn't find a way when his talent wasn't enough.

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.200
I'm not making statements

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.840
if I'm not ready to put some evidence,

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:26.120
like if we were in a courtroom, Exhibit A,

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.560
when he fought Buster Douglas,

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:36.280
Buster Douglas matched his will

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:39.040
and didn't get intimidated, stood up to him.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.680
He didn't do what most people did.

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:44.360
He didn't submit even a little bit.

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.200
Not that night.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:48.640
He had in the past, but that night he didn't.

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:49.480
Why?

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:53.440
Because Buster had a secret weapon that night, his mother.

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.640
Buster's mother had died a few months previous.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.560
He loved his mother very much.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.840
Buster had always had talent, big heavyweight,

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:04.680
talented, could punch, technically solid.

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.640
It was all those things.

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:09.800
Always was, but he quit in fights.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.000
He did less than he should've done.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.720
He never lived up to his ability.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:16.080
He gave in, he submitted.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.720
He wasn't strong enough.

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:20.200
He never had a reason to be strong enough.

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.800
When his mother died, he had a reason.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.520
Nothing could hurt him as much as his mother dying hurt him,

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:27.640
Mike Tyson included.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:31.720
That night, Mike Tyson could not hurt him

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:34.640
as much as his mother had hurt him by dying.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.600
That night he had a reason to be strong for his mother.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.440
And he was strong.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.800
He was everything he was supposed to be, and more.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.120
And he stood up to Mike.

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.560
And Mike, for the first time, maybe ever,

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.560
was in a fight where he had to overcome something.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.920
Where he had to be more than talented,

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:56.520
more than a puncher, more than a guy with scintillating speed.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.320
And he wasn't.

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.800
And then that night got followed

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.560
by another night with Holyfield.

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.960
Holyfield wasn't as talented as him,

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:10.960
as big as a puncher, but Holyfield had the character.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:17.280
He was strong in ways that Tyson wasn't strong.

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:21.920
He was strong in a way where he could find a way.

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.200
He was willing to find a way.

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.240
He's willing to go to the cliff

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.560
to truly die before he's submitted.

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.080
A lot of stuff is just words.

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.800
They're gonna have to carry me out on the shield.

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.720
Yeah, sure, sure, okay.

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.840
Yeah, until it comes time to be carried out on the shield.

01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:43.320
Sometimes there's people that actually mean it.

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.600
You think Mike didn't have that?

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:51.680
Well, all right, let's just say arbitrarily,

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.560
I don't have his record from me.

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:55.080
Let's say he was 55 and five.

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.960
I know he had about five losses.

01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.240
All right, let's say he was 55 and five, right?

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.240
A lot of knockouts.

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:05.720
I have a saying, a fight's not a fight

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.480
until there's something to overcome.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:12.320
Until then, it's just an athletic exhibition, contest.

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.560
Yeah, who's a better athlete?

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:16.120
Who's got more quick twitch fibers?

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.880
Who's more developed?

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.320
Who's better at this?

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:21.640
Who's more developed in those physical areas?

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.880
But a fight is not a fight

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:25.640
until there's something to overcome.

01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:30.640
Okay, so if you go by my definition, not Webster's,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.920
my definition, which I think means something.

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:40.240
Mike Tyson was only in five fights in his life.

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:44.440
The five fights where there was something to overcome

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.040
and he didn't overcome it.

01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:51.280
Now I know people hate me for this, including Tyson.

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.080
I understand, hate me.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:56.080
Oh, you're a hater because you weren't with him.

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.880
You didn't make the money because this, because that,

01:40:57.880 --> 01:40:59.080
because you got betrayed.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.760
I think I'm better than that.

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:03.800
I hope I'm better than that.

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:05.880
I believe I'm better than that.

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.440
I'm not a hater.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.720
I've broadcast fights for 25 years on ESPN

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.480
where there was some people in the corner I did not like.

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:16.280
And if they did a good job, this guy's doing a great job.

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.000
And then there were guys that I liked

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.360
and I had friendship, but he messed up.

01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.960
And we weren't friends no more.

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:27.360
Friendship gotta be tested, remember that?

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.160
So we weren't friends no more.

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.200
But why did I do that?

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.960
Because it was my job.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.440
It was more important for me, when it's all over with,

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.360
the only thing you're left with is,

01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.320
I mean, we're gonna be dust, all of us, right?

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:49.160
The only thing we're left with is what carries on,

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.760
our reputation, you know, legacy, whatever that is.

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.560
But our reputation, that's all we're left with.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:00.000
And that's all our kids are left with.

01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:05.680
I want it to be as good as it can be.

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.360
I've always had an ability, I've done a lot of things wrong

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.720
and I've had a lot of lackings.

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:14.320
But the one strength I've had, if I had a strength,

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:20.320
is to understand somehow, to osmosis, I guess,

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:27.440
to learn the lesson that was important

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:33.120
is not what's in front of you for those five seconds,

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.520
for that moment in life.

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.600
It's what's left behind you when those five seconds are gone.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.000
Whatever it is that you're dealing with,

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.200
whatever that moment is, whatever it is,

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:51.760
that moment, what you do in that moment,

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:59.400
the action of that moment is gonna stay with you

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.880
and be you, it's gonna become you.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.640
What you face for that moment,

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:13.280
it's gone, it's gone in the air, in an instant.

01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.880
It's gone, it's done.

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:17.880
Whether you stand up there and you get shot in the head

01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:20.560
and the guy freaking blows your brains out

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.440
or you're freaking, you stand up here

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.440
or you're fighting a guy who's like a scary guy to fight,

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:31.120
but you fight him and you beat him or he beats you up.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:36.120
But how you deal with that moment

01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:38.720
is what matters.

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:47.720
Represent it yourself in that moment is all that matters.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:50.000
That's gonna live.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
What happened don't matter.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:54.720
It don't matter that you got shot in the head.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.480
I know that sounds absurd,

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.120
but if you believe that it was important to stand up

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:03.720
and take the chance to get shot in the freaking head

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.520
rather than to live like an empty vessel,

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.040
that's all that freaking matters.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.440
And somehow that got freaking wrapped

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.600
into this freaking head of mine.

01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.920
Like, that's what matters.

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:17.440
That's all that matters.

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.280
You know how many times I went and I did with things

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:23.600
whether it was with this one, with Tyson, with that,

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:24.560
I didn't wanna be there.

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:29.560
I was scared to death, but I was more scared.

01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.520
I was more scared.

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:32.560
Living with regret.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.880
How I would have felt.

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:34.720
Yeah.

01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:36.640
I don't wanna be in solitary confinement

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.960
the rest of my life with that freaking guy

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.280
in the cell next to me called regret.

01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:43.560
I don't freaking wanna be next to that guy.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.200
If I wanna freaking go down that road, I'll watch Papillon.

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:48.040
You know what I mean?

01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.120
And I'll get my fill from that.

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.760
But I don't wanna freaking live it.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.240
I'm afraid of what my children will think of me

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:59.000
if I fail in those areas.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.400
Why?

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.920
Because that's forever.

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:07.760
When I'm closing my eyes for the last time,

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.200
I don't wanna have that fear.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.360
I don't wanna have that fear.

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.680
You know, whether I'm going down there

01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:16.200
or whether I'm going up there.

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:21.200
You know, I laugh because I was around guys years ago

01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.680
that used to, when we talk about that, you know, ingest,

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:31.040
you know, and we get a kick out of this one guy

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.120
who'd been around the block a few times.

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:37.400
When he say, hey, Teddy, I ain't worried about that.

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:39.080
I got friends in both places.

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.600
That's a good line.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.600
And I thought it was good.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:51.600
Listen, Mike Tyson, you want me to say he was a great fighter?

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:53.680
Then you want me to betray what I really,

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.520
you know what I mean?

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:55.800
You want me to do that?

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.960
I ain't doing it for, listen,

01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:00.280
I could do it to be a bigger Teddy Atlas

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.000
and I know it would work for me.

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:05.640
I know it would do great promotional work for me.

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:08.840
I know it would make me more popular in certain areas.

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:09.760
I know it.

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:12.920
I'm not that dumb, not that dumb,

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:15.800
but I also know what else it would do to me.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:19.480
And I don't want it to do that to me.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.160
I think he was a great talent.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:23.080
I think maybe the night with Michael Spinks,

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:24.640
maybe the night with Mike,

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.840
maybe he could have been that fighter,

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.680
but he didn't never really get tested,

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.120
but he might've been ready no matter what

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:32.760
to be tested that night.

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:33.920
That's how good he was.

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:35.360
That's how, even though it was a guy

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.440
who used to be a light heavyweight, I get it,

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.120
but was still a guy who beat Larry Holmes,

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:41.640
who still had something left, Michael Spinks.

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:44.960
So, and a great puncher and an Olympic gold medalist,

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.960
but, and a special fighter,

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:49.360
one of the great light heavyweights of all time.

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:50.800
You know what Mike Tyson was?

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.400
He was a meteor.

01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.080
He was a meteor that struck across

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:57.880
and not too many meteors, and we still talk about him.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:01.280
And unlike Halley's comment, he came back

01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:04.160
and he's walking around,

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:08.520
and he has become greater after his career,

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.160
more loved, more beloved, more awed,

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.800
and he's been forgiven.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.800
He found the fountain of forgiveness.

01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:19.320
I don't know, I wish I could find that,

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.840
where he has been forgotten for all his shortcomings,

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.320
all the things that he may have done, may not have done.

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.240
We don't know, only him and God know.

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.440
But he's been forgiven of all that,

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:32.760
and he's been not only forgiven,

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.120
he's raised above it and above that,

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.640
and been brought above that.

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:41.680
He's been brought to the pyramids

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:48.520
of the greatest athletes in the world,

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.400
and in every way, in every way as a person,

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.960
as a fighter, as a historian, as a figure,

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:05.080
as a celebrity, I mean-

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.320
Even a philosopher.

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.760
Everything, so I will take it back.

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.080
All right, all you guys out there, you forgive me,

01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:16.240
he's the greatest of all time if you encapsulate all that.

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:19.080
If you encapsulate everything I just tried to describe

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.480
and explain, if you put that all,

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:24.280
he's the greatest of all time, yeah, he is.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.120
But he still might be 0-5 in a record of 55 fights.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:33.920
He might, in Teddy Atlas's book,

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:37.360
again, I got friends at both places,

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:40.920
so I was okay, wherever I go, I have company.

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:44.520
Somebody there will like me, despite me saying this.

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:47.160
He might be 0-5 because of five fights

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:49.480
where there was something to overcome,

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:51.640
which really defines a fight.

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.840
He came, he didn't find a way.

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:58.640
Let me ask Teddy Atlas to introspect

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:00.160
on the human nature here.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.680
As part of the complexities of your feelings

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:07.680
on this whole thing is that you know, to some degree,

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:10.440
that if you were coaching Mike Tyson,

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:13.160
he could be truly great throughout.

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.040
I know, I'm gonna cut you right off

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:16.760
because you asked a million dollar question,

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:20.040
I wish you didn't, but you did, you did.

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.760
Because that's why.

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:22.600
When do I get paid?

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.480
That's why you get paid.

01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.520
I get it, you took the words out of my mouth.

01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:28.280
That's why you are where you are.

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:31.720
And that's why I'm here.

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:34.320
The humility.

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.920
I'm gonna, again, full disclosure, it's important, right?

01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.080
I'm gonna cheat, I'm gonna take some of Cuss's wisdom,

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.520
all right, a little bit of mine.

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:51.040
Cuss told somebody that if Teddy Atlas got his way,

01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:53.520
he might have been a better person,

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:56.040
but we would have risked him not being a great fighter.

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:01.160
Now I believe, and I thought Cuss did,

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:03.960
and I think he did up to that point in his life,

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:06.360
that part of your strength of character

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:11.360
made you a great fighter, and truly a great fighter,

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.840
and part of the strength of character

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:17.480
and part of that battle to be a better person,

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.800
that fight, if you will, to be a better person,

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:23.040
to overcome the things, to be a better person.

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:26.440
Part of that fire you have to go through

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:27.680
to be a better person.

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.360
I really, truly bought into it, and I'm in for life.

01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:38.680
That is really the only way to be a great fighter.

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:43.680
And I don't think that's,

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:45.640
what Cuss meant.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.360
I thought he meant, I think he meant that

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:53.600
Cuss knew more than I did of what was about to come

01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:56.080
and what would come and what the world was,

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.440
how people would try to steal him,

01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:58.520
how people would take him,

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:01.280
how people would steal his guy.

01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:07.560
The last thing he had, really,

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:11.400
the thing that he lived for,

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.000
because he lived to have another heavyweight champ,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.200
the greatest fighter ever, Cuss,

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:17.960
and Cuss is mine, he could be.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:21.480
And I believe that Cuss knew that he

01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:26.560
he could put forward a guy that had the ability

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.360
to be the greatest fighter ever

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.560
without fully completing the mission

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:32.800
of what it takes to really be great,

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.400
but that he wouldn't be around to have to witness it,

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:40.680
and that he wouldn't,

01:51:42.800 --> 01:51:45.560
he was willing to, oh man, this is awful.

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:51.120
He's willing to concede that he might be dead

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:53.120
in order to have eternal life,

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:54.760
in order to have greatness,

01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:57.320
which Cuss does have greatness,

01:51:57.320 --> 01:51:59.880
and part of that greatness is attached to Tyson,

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:00.760
and he deserves it.

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:02.600
He deserves it, Cuss was a great man.

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:06.040
And I wouldn't be here partly without him.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.800
But that was part of the calculation.

01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:10.720
I know that's deep, but I know that's,

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:13.320
oh god, I hate myself right now.

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:22.680
But Cuss, he knew he was getting out free.

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.120
He knew he was gonna not have to be there.

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:27.960
He was getting off easy.

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:30.320
Oh, Teddy, how do you say someone's gonna be dead?

01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:31.680
They're getting off easy.

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:34.560
Well, I'll say it again in case you didn't hear me, all right?

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.040
He was gonna get off easy,

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:41.400
and not have to face where he came up short,

01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:43.360
because he did his job,

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:46.160
because he put forward the greatest fight of all time,

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:47.520
and you guys screwed it up.

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.080
And he knew that that might happen,

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.480
but you guys screwed it up.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:55.760
And whatever, that's your fault, that's on,

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:57.760
I tell you, Tyson would be mad at this,

01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:59.280
but that's on Tyson.

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:01.880
How can you say that, Teddy?

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.200
He loved me.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:05.040
I'm not saying he didn't love you,

01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:07.480
but he loved some other stuff, too.

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.160
And I don't know if Tyson could ever come

01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:11.600
to grips like with that,

01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:14.600
and it's not his job to,

01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:18.480
but it's my job not to hide from it.

01:53:18.480 --> 01:53:20.320
I know Cuss in Dimensions that other people

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.960
just only think they know.

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:23.800
Did Cuss know?

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.680
Did Cuss know this about himself?

01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:30.280
Did he reflect, did he introspect?

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.120
Well, he sent a message to me.

01:53:32.120 --> 01:53:34.200
Cuss sent a guy to me.

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:35.320
My wife was pregnant.

01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.440
We were living in an apartment in Catskill

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:38.520
on Corteskill Road.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.320
We went through all this,

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:44.560
and I was getting ready to move to Staten Island,

01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:47.920
and we still were there for a little while,

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:50.440
before we did, after all this went down.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:56.280
He sent a guy to me, to the house,

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.040
secret, whatever you want to call it,

01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.120
my wife, me.

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.880
So I listened to him.

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:06.880
Cuss said, if you leave, I'm a messenger,

01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.160
you know, whatever, if you leave.

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.360
This was in the aftermath of what,

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:16.400
the gun and the whole thing.

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.400
You gotta remember, Tyson was a ward of the state.

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.960
He was put in Cuss's custody.

01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:24.480
Cuss was looking to adopt him, for obvious reasons.

01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:26.600
So he had control, and he loved him.

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:30.560
How dare I say anything less?

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:31.400
I won't.

01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:33.640
But it made sense, too.

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.280
But he was a ward of the state, still.

01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:37.960
Do you know what that means?

01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:38.800
There's rules.

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.480
Means the state's still overlooking it.

01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:44.400
If he ain't living the right life,

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.840
you know, you gotta remember,

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:51.840
he came out of a jail, so reform school.

01:54:53.160 --> 01:54:54.440
But if he ain't living the right life,

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.480
he could be taken away from Cuss.

01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.880
What's not living the right life?

01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.480
Well, he wasn't in school no more,

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:00.880
they didn't know about it.

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:04.160
He had some things that were going on,

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:06.240
we won't get into that right now,

01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:08.480
in school and different things, whatever.

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:11.480
And he had his trainer put a gun to his head.

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.440
That ain't so good.

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.960
If a report came back to them that that happened,

01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:19.720
he would have been taken away from Cuss.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:21.160
That couldn't happen.

01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.000
Look, nobody knows this.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.320
I talk about it a little bit, but never probably,

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.360
because why would I?

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:29.720
I don't know, why am I doing it now?

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:32.360
I don't know, because, I don't know.

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:33.800
Because I am, because it's now.

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.200
Because it's now, maybe.

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:37.800
Maybe because it's now, I don't know.

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:42.800
So he sent this man that obviously we both knew,

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:46.160
and he said, here's the deal, Teddy.

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:51.280
No talk about this, wants it to disappear, basically.

01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:56.280
You leave, and he will give you 5% his word.

01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:57.160
Can you imagine?

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.320
He will give you 5% of Tyson's earnings

01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.680
for the rest of his career.

01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:06.600
And, but I don't regret it one bit,

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.840
because it wouldn't have happened anyway.

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:09.960
See, that's where I can be honest with my,

01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:12.240
people say, oh, stand up guy,

01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.640
because I told him to shove it where the, you know,

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:18.040
you know, in that place,

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:21.520
and tell Cuss to shove it in that freaking place.

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:22.520
You know, I was mad.

01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:25.560
Teddy, Teddy, don't get angry.

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:26.960
Don't get angry.

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:27.800
Are you out of here?

01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:28.640
Are you serious?

01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:29.960
Get out of here.

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.400
Tell him to go shove it over.

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:35.240
And, you know, my wife was like, huh.

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:39.280
But, and then people like, why didn't you take the deal?

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:40.600
It wasn't a deal.

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:45.600
It was an escape clause for Cuss.

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.600
It was an insurance policy that his, you know,

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.920
this kid wouldn't be taken away from.

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:54.560
And thank God he wasn't.

01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.240
But I wasn't gonna go and say nothing.

01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.280
They didn't have to worry about it.

01:56:57.280 --> 01:56:59.360
Cuss forgot who I was.

01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:02.280
Cuss forgot why he went to court for me.

01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:05.920
Because of those characteristics that he said he loved,

01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:08.920
and he noticed, and that he admired.

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.120
I didn't lose those characters.

01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:12.960
He forgot that that was me.

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:15.040
He forgot who he was talking to.

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.840
He didn't have to do that.

01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:20.440
How about, that's why I told him to shove it up his ass.

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:23.520
Not because of the other insult.

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:27.200
And then when people said to me, oh, you will stand up,

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.800
because it was around a little bit.

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:30.720
It was around in the circles.

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:32.880
And then when people, oh, stand up, Teddy.

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:35.560
He didn't care about the money.

01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:36.720
I said, stand up, Teddy.

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:38.280
What are you talking about?

01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:41.640
How about just realistic, Teddy?

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:43.680
How about I live in a real world

01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.360
that I was never gonna get that money?

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.200
So I'm standing up to something that I knew never existed.

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.640
So I ain't stand up.

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:51.760
Not in that way.

01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:53.360
I am in other ways, maybe.

01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:56.800
But don't put a medal on my chest for that.

01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:58.960
Because that never existed.

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:01.840
It was never meant to exist.

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:03.200
But he didn't even understand.

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:07.320
That was the one thing that really disappointed me in Cuss.

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:11.000
I was like, Cuss, you really allowed this to get to you.

01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:18.160
You allowed it to really fog up your thinking

01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:20.600
to the point where you're smarter than that.

01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:22.640
You're better than that.

01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:26.280
That you would actually think you got a freaking offer me

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:30.880
of freaking pieces of silver?

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:31.720
Yeah.

01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:32.960
You really think that?

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.800
That's what you, freak you!

01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:37.800
Like, all that you told me, that you love me

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:41.720
and that I was the young master and all this,

01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:44.120
and you think you were gonna buy me?

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:48.560
And I was gonna, and that was gonna keep me quiet?

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:49.880
How about I would keep quiet

01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.800
because I would always keep quiet?

01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:55.360
So he thought maybe you might betray him.

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.320
Isn't that interesting?

01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:58.160
Yeah.

01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.320
And why did he think that?

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:03.280
No, no, really.

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:04.240
Fear?

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:07.200
Yeah, but yeah, fear is at the essence of everything.

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:08.640
It's connected with everything.

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:11.000
Fear of losing what he was gonna lose.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.360
But it was more than fear.

01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:15.560
It was him not believing in the things

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:17.160
that he told me he believed in.

01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:20.200
He didn't even know that.

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:24.480
He believed in me because I was a stand-up guy,

01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:26.480
because I didn't sell myself,

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:30.000
because I didn't freaking turn evidence,

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.160
I didn't make a deal, I didn't do,

01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:33.600
and that's why he went to court,

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:36.520
that's why he stood up for me, and I appreciate it.

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.120
And that was what he lived by, and that was his,

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:41.360
those were the blocks of being a man.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.720
Oh, so much for those blocks.

01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:48.000
Well, it's like you said, loyalty.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.800
Like you said, loyalty requires,

01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:54.840
he would have had to take a risk

01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:58.160
on losing immortality that he would achieve

01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:01.880
by creating a great heavyweight champion.

02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:03.280
100%.

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:05.320
But the only way you ever find out

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:07.120
if somebody is really that.

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:07.960
It's hard.

02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:09.800
It's the test.

02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:10.680
And it was Cuss.

02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:12.760
This is Shakespearean, you know?

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:13.600
This story.

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:15.720
Cuss told me, Cuss said,

02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:18.080
and the tests come in different forms.

02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:20.800
I said, all right, Cuss.

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.960
This was his test.

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:25.280
And some people pass this test

02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:27.240
because they're able to pass that test,

02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:30.080
because it's not really a test, not for them,

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.840
because it doesn't speak to their weakness.

02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:35.760
But it's the test that speaks to the weakness.

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:37.000
That's the one.

02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.000
So this one, I get it.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.480
I get what it spoke to, Cuss.

02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.320
You know what?

02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.080
At the end of the day, I forgive you.

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:48.440
And I feel bad for you.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:53.240
I feel bad that you were put in that position

02:00:53.240 --> 02:00:55.280
after you lived your life that way

02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:58.120
and that you taught that

02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:01.040
and you preached that from the mountaintops,

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:02.800
that you had to be,

02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.680
that you had to be,

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.800
I'm not gonna use the word,

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:18.800
but that you had to fail yourself

02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:22.680
and that you had to somehow know that before you died.

02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:25.280
I just pray that you didn't know that

02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:26.360
and you still don't know that

02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:28.320
because you were great.

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.240
You were great.

02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:33.600
And you've given me some,

02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:43.360
you know, you've given me some to aspire towards.

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:48.880
To try to be less weak,

02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:51.000
try to be better

02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:58.440
and try to be as good as you want it to be.

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:02.040
I wish I can someday.

02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:06.560
More importantly, I wish I could make my father,

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:08.960
you know,

02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:10.800
feel,

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.960
just feel good up there.

02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:19.760
Your grandfather now.

02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.360
Yeah, for your grandchildren.

02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:25.280
What, if you can give them advice

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.320
on how to live a life they can be proud of.

02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:33.720
Just,

02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.520
do everything you can

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:44.800
to the best of your ability every day

02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.160
to like yourself.

02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:54.360
To give yourself a reason to actually say,

02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.200
I'd like to be friends with that guy.

02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.280
Is loyalty one of the reasons,

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:03.520
one of the things to aspire to?

02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:08.400
Loyalty is your chance.

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:11.080
To have a fulfilled life.

02:03:13.600 --> 02:03:17.440
Loyalty is your chance to have strength,

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:21.600
to have all the things you need to have a good life,

02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:22.640
to be a good parent,

02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:24.720
be a good husband,

02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:26.840
be a good grandfather.

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:29.480
Hopefully be a good role model.

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:32.440
Loyalty

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:34.640
is

02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:43.320
loyalty is if you can find something to drink,

02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.880
to take into your body,

02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:53.600
to make you prepared for life,

02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:55.640
to be all the things that you wanna be,

02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:59.080
to be strong enough to be those things.

02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.240
Loyalty would be the thing you would drink.

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.720
And when I say loyal,

02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:07.200
I mean unequivocally,

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:09.560
I mean unconditionally,

02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:12.480
not conveniently.

02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:13.840
Obviously you know that.

02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.240
If you could be loyal,

02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:18.960
you could be a good person.

02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:20.800
You could be a person that you would actually like

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:21.640
to be around

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:25.240
because you could be a person you could rely on.

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:28.720
And I think that's one of the greatest assets

02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:30.240
that a human being can have.

02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.200
And what do you do when you're betrayed?

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.440
How do you overcome that?

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.240
You think of what you learned from it.

02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:44.720
Use it as a roadmap

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:52.400
to remember and to think back of how you got there

02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:58.000
and how you got to the place where you got betrayed

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
and how that person got to that place.

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:03.240
Try to remember that in your own journey.

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:07.040
Has it for you made you cynical?

02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:09.920
Like how do you take the leap of trust

02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:14.920
towards people again and again after that?

02:05:14.920 --> 02:05:19.920
Just by remembering that I'm still trying to forgive myself

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:22.840
for the things that I came up short with.

02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:24.680
And if I haven't figured that out yet,

02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:30.840
it's probably okay to say,

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.360
they didn't figure it out yet.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.280
They didn't get it.

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:38.680
They didn't figure it out.

02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:40.120
And if I couldn't figure it out

02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:41.960
and I'm still trying to figure it out,

02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:49.040
maybe I could get over that initial stabbing

02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:53.320
of where it feels like it does feel kind of like a stabbing

02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:56.920
that you feel when you're betrayed initially

02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:01.920
and that you can only think of anger, revenge, hatred,

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:06.760
and those things, I'm not proud of that,

02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:11.400
but I felt all those things.

02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:13.760
And I still feel them sometimes.

02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:15.360
And then I go back and say,

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.760
hey, you're still working at forgiving yourself

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:19.360
for some things.

02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:20.720
Try to remember that kid.

02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:24.760
That means an important thing.

02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:28.680
Forgetfulness is pretty important too.

02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:32.240
And try to remember why we forget.

02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:35.560
Why do we forget?

02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:38.640
Because it wasn't something you felt proud of.

02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:43.960
You think about your death?

02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:45.000
Are you afraid of it?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.120
You know, it's funny you asked that.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:49.720
I never used to think about it.

02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:58.600
I know people in both places, you know.

02:06:58.600 --> 02:06:59.440
I know.

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.280
You got it covered.

02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:03.280
You're gonna be all right.

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:04.400
Don't forget that.

02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:06.000
I know people in both places.

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:10.160
Both neighborhoods.

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:27.480
I've been given credit for being brave

02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:29.280
in certain spots in life.

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:34.560
I hope I can be brave

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:36.800
when it comes time to leave life.

02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:40.520
I hope I can be.

02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:42.480
You know, and that's, you know,

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:46.280
that's as real and honest as you can be about it.

02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:48.080
I hope I can be.

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:50.520
You know, so far so good.

02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:53.880
You know, when I've had to be certain things

02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:56.640
that I was scared to freaking death,

02:07:58.400 --> 02:08:00.200
I found a way to be them.

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:02.000
For the most part.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.000
And so I figured when that day comes,

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:12.240
I'll figure that out too.

02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:13.560
It's gonna be another test.

02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:14.560
Maybe the last one.

02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:19.320
Teddy, it's a huge honor to talk to you.

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:20.400
It's my pleasure.

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:22.240
Thank you for being the human you are,

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:23.720
for being honest.

02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:28.000
Honest about the full range of human nature.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.520
And thank you for talking today.

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:30.400
Thank you.

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:34.640
Thank you for having me and thanks for listening.

02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:37.040

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:38.280

And now let me leave you with some words from Muhammad Ali.

02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:49.360
I hated every minute of training,

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:53.040
but I said, don't quit, suffer now,

02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.600
and live the rest of your life as a champion.

02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:57.840
Thank you for listening.

02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:59.920
I hope to see you next time.
