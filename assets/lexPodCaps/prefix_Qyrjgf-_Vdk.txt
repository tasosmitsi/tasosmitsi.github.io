00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
The following is a conversation with Sam Harris, his second time on the podcast.

00:04.800 --> 00:10.000
As I said two years ago when I first met and spoke with Sam, he's one of the most influential

00:10.000 --> 00:15.200
pioneering thinkers of our time, as the host of the Making Sense podcast, creator of the

00:15.200 --> 00:21.840
Waking Up app, and the author of many seminal books on human nature and the human mind,

00:21.840 --> 00:28.540
including The End of Faith, The More Landscape, Lying, Free Will, and Waking Up.

00:28.540 --> 00:34.860
In this conversation, besides our mutual fascination with AGI and free will, we do also go deep

00:34.860 --> 00:41.660
into controversial, challenging topics of Donald Trump, Hunter Biden, January 6th, vaccines,

00:41.660 --> 00:47.260
lab leak, Kanye West, and several key figures at the center of public discourse, including

00:47.260 --> 00:53.180
Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, both of whom have been friends of Sam and have become friends

00:53.180 --> 00:54.180
of mine.

00:54.740 --> 01:00.420
Somehow, an amazing life trajectory that I do not deserve in any way and in fact believe

01:00.420 --> 01:03.300
is probably a figment of my imagination.

01:04.500 --> 01:09.620
And if it's alright, please allow me to say a few words about this personal aspect of the conversation

01:09.620 --> 01:16.100
of discussing Joe, Elon, and others. What's been weighing heavy on my heart since the beginning of

01:16.100 --> 01:22.100
the pandemic, now three years ago, is that many people I look to for wisdom in public discourse

01:22.100 --> 01:27.300
stopped talking to each other as often, with respect, humility, and love, when the world needed

01:27.300 --> 01:33.620
those kinds of conversations the most. My hope is that they start talking again, they start being

01:33.620 --> 01:38.660
friends again, they start noticing the humanity that connects them that is much deeper than the

01:38.660 --> 01:45.620
disagreements that divide them. So, let me take this moment to say, with humility and honesty,

01:45.620 --> 01:52.820
why I look up to and am inspired by Joe, Elon, and Sam. I think Joe Rogan is important to the

01:52.820 --> 01:58.580
world as a voice of compassionate curiosity and open-mindedness to ideas both radical and

01:58.580 --> 02:03.940
mainstream, sometimes with humor, sometimes with brutal honesty, always pushing for more

02:03.940 --> 02:10.020
kindness in the world. I think Elon Musk is important to the world as an engineer, leader,

02:10.020 --> 02:14.740
entrepreneur, and human being who takes on the hardest problems that face humanity and

02:14.740 --> 02:20.100
refuses to accept the constraints of conventional thinking that made the solutions to these problems

02:20.100 --> 02:27.620
seem impossible. I think Sam Harris is important to the world as a fearless voice who fights for

02:27.620 --> 02:33.940
the pursuit of truth against growing forces of echo chambers and audience capture, taking unpopular

02:33.940 --> 02:41.220
perspectives and defending them with rigor and resilience. I both celebrate and criticize all

02:41.220 --> 02:47.060
three privately, and they criticize me, usually more effectively, for which I always learn a lot

02:47.060 --> 02:52.820
and always appreciate. Most importantly, there is respect and love for each other as human beings,

02:52.820 --> 02:57.700
the very thing that I think the world needs most now in a time of division and chaos.

02:58.660 --> 03:04.580
I will continue to try to mend divisions, to try to understand, not to ride, to turn the other

03:04.580 --> 03:10.820
cheek if needed, to return hate with love. Sometimes people criticize me for being naive,

03:11.460 --> 03:19.380
cheesy, simplistic, all of that. I know. I agree. But I really am speaking from the heart,

03:19.380 --> 03:25.620
and I'm trying. This world is too fucking beautiful not to try, in whatever way I know how.

03:26.820 --> 03:32.740
I love you all. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in

03:32.740 --> 03:40.580
the description. And now, dear friends, here's Sam Harris. What is more effective at making

03:40.580 --> 03:47.460
a net positive impact on the world, empathy or reason? It depends on what you mean by empathy.

03:47.460 --> 03:54.180
There are at least two kinds of empathy. There's the cognitive form, which is,

03:55.620 --> 04:01.780
I would argue, even a species of reason. It's just understanding another person's point of view.

04:01.780 --> 04:08.100
You understand why they're suffering or why they're happy. You have a theory of mind

04:08.900 --> 04:16.740
about another human being that is accurate, and so you can navigate in relationship to them

04:16.740 --> 04:22.420
more effectively. And then there's another layer entirely, not incompatible with that,

04:22.420 --> 04:27.700
but just distinct, which is what people often mean by empathy, which is more

04:27.700 --> 04:36.980
a kind of emotional contagion. You feel depressed, and I begin to feel depressed along with you,

04:36.980 --> 04:43.460
because it's contagious. We're so close, and I'm so concerned about you, and your problems become

04:43.460 --> 04:51.780
my problems, and it bleeds through. Now, I think both of those capacities are very important, but

04:52.740 --> 05:01.700
the emotional contagion piece, and this is not really my thesis. This is something I have more

05:01.700 --> 05:09.380
or less learned from Paul Bloom, the psychologist who wrote a book on this topic titled Against

05:09.380 --> 05:18.900
Empathy. The emotional social contagion piece is a bad guide rather often for ethical behavior

05:18.900 --> 05:24.820
and ethical intuitions. I'll give you the clear example of this, which is

05:27.460 --> 05:36.740
we find stories with a single identifiable protagonist who we can effortlessly empathize

05:36.740 --> 05:45.860
with far more compelling than data. This is the classic case of the little girl who falls down a

05:45.860 --> 05:53.940
well. This is somebody's daughter. You see the parents distraught on television. You hear her

05:53.940 --> 05:58.580
cries from the bottom of the well. The whole country stops. There was an example of this

05:59.620 --> 06:03.620
25 years ago, I think, where it was just wall-to-wall on CNN. This is just the perfect

06:03.620 --> 06:10.020
use of CNN. It was 72 hours, whatever it was, of continuous coverage of just extracting this

06:10.020 --> 06:16.900
girl from a well. We effortlessly pay attention to that. We care about it. We will donate money

06:16.900 --> 06:21.220
toward it. It marshals 100% of our compassion and altruistic impulse.

06:22.820 --> 06:27.300
Whereas if you hear that there's a genocide raging in some country you've never been to

06:27.300 --> 06:35.380
and never intended to go to, the numbers don't make a dent. We find the story boring. We'll

06:35.380 --> 06:44.020
change the channel in the face of a genocide. It could be 500,000 little girls have fallen

06:44.020 --> 06:52.020
down wells in that country and we still don't care. Many of us have come to believe that this

06:52.020 --> 06:58.180
is a bug rather than a feature of our moral psychology. Empathy plays an unhelpful role

06:58.180 --> 07:04.260
there. Ultimately, I think when we're making big decisions about what we should do and how to

07:04.260 --> 07:09.140
mitigate human suffering and what's worth valuing and how we should protect those values,

07:11.620 --> 07:15.620
I think reason is the better tool, but it's not that I would want to dispense with

07:15.620 --> 07:20.260
any part of empathy either. Well, there's a lot of dangers to go on there, but briefly to mention

07:20.260 --> 07:27.460
you've recently talked about effective altruism on your podcast. I think you mentioned some

07:27.460 --> 07:33.220
interesting statement. I'm going to horribly misquote you, but that you'd rather live in a

07:33.220 --> 07:37.460
world. It doesn't really make sense, but you'd rather live in a world where you care about

07:38.020 --> 07:43.780
maybe your daughter and son more than 100 people that live across the world, something like this.

07:44.420 --> 07:49.860
Where the calculus is not always perfect, but somehow it makes sense to live in a world where

07:49.860 --> 07:54.580
it's irrational in this way and yet empathetic in the way you've been discussing.

07:54.580 --> 07:59.220
Right. I'm not sure what the right answer is there or even whether there is one right answer. There

07:59.220 --> 08:07.060
could be multiple peaks on this part of the moral landscape. The opposition is between an ethic

08:07.060 --> 08:14.820
that's articulated by someone like the Dalai Lama or really any exponent of classic Buddhism

08:15.460 --> 08:22.420
would say that the ultimate enlightened ethic is true dispassion with respect to friends and

08:22.420 --> 08:30.420
strangers. The mind of the Buddha would be truly dispassionate. You would love and care about all

08:30.420 --> 08:40.020
people equally. By that light, it seems some kind of ethical failing or at least failure to fully

08:40.020 --> 08:48.260
actualize compassion in the limit or enlightened wisdom in the limit to care more or even much

08:48.260 --> 08:54.820
more about your kids than the kids of other people and to prioritize your energy in that

08:54.820 --> 08:58.660
way. You spend all this time trying to figure out how to keep your kids healthy and happy and

08:59.220 --> 09:06.420
you'll attend to their minutest concerns and however superficial. Again, there's a genocide

09:06.420 --> 09:14.020
raging in Sudan or wherever and it takes up less than 1% of your bandwidth. I'm not sure it would

09:14.020 --> 09:19.940
be a better world if everyone was running the Dalai Lama program there. I think some prioritization

09:19.940 --> 09:29.780
of one's nearest and dearest ethically might be optimal because we'll all be doing that

09:29.780 --> 09:39.220
and we'll all be doing that in a circumstance where we have certain norms and laws and other

09:39.220 --> 09:47.940
structures that force us to be dispassionate where that matters. When my daughter gets sick

09:47.940 --> 09:54.900
and I have to take her to a hospital, I really want her to get attention and I'm worried about

09:54.900 --> 09:59.540
her more than I'm worried about everyone else in the lobby but the truth is I actually don't want

09:59.540 --> 10:05.220
a totally corrupt hospital. I don't want a hospital that treats my daughter better than anyone else in

10:05.220 --> 10:10.660
the lobby because she's my daughter and I've bribed the guy at the door or the guy's a fan

10:10.660 --> 10:16.900
of my podcast or whatever the thing is. You don't want starkly corrupt, unfair situations

10:18.340 --> 10:26.340
and when you get pressed down the hierarchy of Maslow's needs individually and societally,

10:27.460 --> 10:32.580
a bunch of those variables change and they change for the worse understandably but yeah,

10:33.140 --> 10:41.380
when everyone's corrupt and you're in a state of collective emergency, you've got a lifeboat

10:41.380 --> 10:51.380
problem, you're scrambling to get into the lifeboat, then fairness and norms and the other

10:51.380 --> 10:59.700
vestiges of civilization begin to get stripped off. We can't reason from those emergencies to

10:59.780 --> 11:05.940
normal life. In normal life, we want justice, we want fairness, we're all better off for it

11:05.940 --> 11:12.660
even when the spotlight of our concern is focused on the people we know, the people who are friends,

11:12.660 --> 11:18.500
the people who are family, people we have good reason to care about. We still by default want

11:18.500 --> 11:24.980
a system that protects the interests of strangers too and we know that generally speaking, in game

11:24.980 --> 11:30.260
theoretic terms, we're all going to tend to be better off in a fair system than a corrupt one.

11:30.260 --> 11:37.940
One of the failure modes of empathy is our susceptibility to anecdotal data.

11:38.660 --> 11:45.380
Just a good story will get us to not think clearly but what about empathy in the context

11:45.380 --> 11:49.620
of just discussing ideas with other people and then there's a large number of people like in

11:49.620 --> 11:56.900
this country, red and blue, half the population believes certain things on immigration or on

11:57.860 --> 12:03.140
the response to the pandemic or any kind of controversial issue even if the election was

12:03.140 --> 12:11.460
fairly executed. Having an empathy for their worldview, trying to understand where they're

12:11.460 --> 12:16.820
coming from, not just in the explicit statement of their idea but the entirety of the roots

12:16.820 --> 12:21.860
from which their ideas stems, that kind of empathy while you're discussing ideas.

12:22.900 --> 12:29.140
In your pursuit of truth, having empathy for the perspective of a large number of other people

12:30.980 --> 12:33.700
versus raw mathematical reason.

12:33.700 --> 12:39.060
I think it's important but it only takes you so far. It doesn't get you to

12:39.140 --> 12:50.500
truth. Truth is not decided by democratic principles and certain people believe things

12:50.500 --> 12:55.540
for understandable reasons but those reasons are nonetheless bad reasons. They don't scale,

12:55.540 --> 13:00.980
they don't generalize, they're not reasons anyone should adopt for themselves or respect

13:01.620 --> 13:07.860
epistemologically and yet their circumstance is understandable and it's something you can care

13:07.860 --> 13:14.820
about. I think there's many examples of this that you might be thinking of but

13:16.340 --> 13:22.820
one that comes to mind is I've been super critical of Trump obviously and I've been

13:22.820 --> 13:30.580
super critical of certain people for endorsing him or not criticizing him when he really made

13:30.580 --> 13:37.460
it patently obvious who he was. If there had been any doubt initially, there was no doubt when we

13:37.460 --> 13:48.820
have a sitting president who's not agreeing to a peaceful transfer of power. I'm critical of all

13:48.820 --> 13:57.220
of that and yet the fact that many millions of Americans didn't see what was wrong with Trump

13:57.220 --> 14:05.460
or didn't see through his con, they bought into the idea that he was a brilliant businessman

14:05.460 --> 14:08.900
who might just be able to change things because he's so unconventional and so

14:09.860 --> 14:14.580
his heart is in the right place. He's really a man of the people even though he's gold-plated

14:15.220 --> 14:23.380
everything in his life. They bought the myth somehow largely because they had seen him on

14:23.380 --> 14:30.500
television for almost a decade and a half pretending to be this genius businessman

14:30.500 --> 14:37.700
who could get things done. It's understandable to me that many very frustrated people who have

14:37.700 --> 14:45.300
not had their hopes and dreams actualized, who have been the victims of globalism and

14:47.540 --> 14:57.460
many other current trends, it's understandable that they would be confused and not see the

14:57.460 --> 15:06.180
liability of electing a grossly incompetent morbidly narcissistic person into the presidency.

15:08.420 --> 15:12.340
Which is to say that I don't blame, there are many, many millions of people who I don't

15:12.340 --> 15:18.660
necessarily blame for the Trump phenomenon but I can nonetheless bemoan the phenomenon

15:18.660 --> 15:26.420
as indicative of a very bad state of affairs in our society. There's two levels to it. One is,

15:26.420 --> 15:30.980
I think you have to call a spade a spade when you're talking about how things actually work

15:30.980 --> 15:38.340
and what things are likely to happen or not but then you can recognize that people have very

15:38.340 --> 15:44.580
different life experiences and yeah, I think empathy and probably the better word for what I

15:45.380 --> 15:54.740
would hope to embody there is compassion. To really wish people well and to really wish

15:55.460 --> 16:00.580
strangers well, effortlessly wish them well, but to realize that there is no opposition between,

16:01.380 --> 16:05.860
at bottom there's no real opposition between selfishness and selflessness because

16:06.740 --> 16:13.860
wise selfishness really takes into account other people's happiness. Do you want to live

16:13.860 --> 16:20.180
in a society where you have everything but most other people have nothing or do you want to live

16:20.180 --> 16:26.020
in a society where you're surrounded by happy, creative, self-actualized people who are having

16:26.020 --> 16:30.980
their hopes and dreams realized? I think it's obvious that the second society is much better,

16:30.980 --> 16:40.260
however much you can guard your good luck. But what about having empathy for certain

16:40.260 --> 16:46.260
principles that people believe? For example, the pushback, the other perspective on this,

16:46.260 --> 16:51.220
because you said bought the myth of Trump as a great businessman. There could be a lot of people

16:51.220 --> 16:57.620
that are supporters of Trump who could say that Sam Harris bought the myth that we have this

16:57.620 --> 17:03.460
government of the people by the people that actually represents the people as opposed to

17:03.460 --> 17:09.380
a bunch of elites who are running a giant bureaucracy that is corrupt, that is feeding themselves

17:09.380 --> 17:13.460
and they're actually not representing the people and then here's this chaos agent,

17:14.100 --> 17:19.060
Trump, who speaks off the top of his head. Yeah, he's flawed in all this number of ways.

17:19.060 --> 17:25.940
He's a more comedian than he is a presidential type of figure and he's actually creating the

17:25.940 --> 17:31.140
kind of chaos that's going to shake up this bureaucracy, shake up the elites that are so

17:31.140 --> 17:36.100
uncomfortable because they don't want the world to know about the game they got running on everybody

17:36.100 --> 17:42.660
else. So that's the kind of perspective that they would take and say, yeah, there's these flaws that

17:42.660 --> 17:48.980
Trump has, but this is necessary. I agree with the first part. So I haven't bought the myth that

17:49.700 --> 17:56.740
it's a truly representative democracy in the way that we might idealize.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.460
On some level, I mean, this is a different conversation, but on some level, I'm not even

18:03.460 --> 18:12.260
sure how much I think it should be. I'm not sure we want in the end everyone's opinion

18:13.060 --> 18:17.780
given equal weight about just what we should do about anything and I include myself in that.

18:17.780 --> 18:22.740
I mean, there are many topics around which I don't deserve to have a strong opinion because

18:22.740 --> 18:27.300
I don't know what I'm talking about or what I would be talking about if I had a strong opinion.

18:30.340 --> 18:35.780
And I think we'll probably get to that, to some of those topics because I've declined to have

18:35.780 --> 18:39.060
certain conversations on my podcast just because I think I'm the wrong person to have that

18:39.060 --> 18:47.780
conversation. And I think it's important to see those bright lines in one's life and in the moment

18:47.780 --> 18:58.980
politically and ethically. So yeah, leave aside the viability of democracy. I'm under no illusions

18:59.780 --> 19:07.380
that all of our institutions are worth preserving precisely as they have been up until the moment,

19:07.380 --> 19:14.340
this great orange wrecking ball came swinging through our lives. But it was a very bad bet

19:14.340 --> 19:21.780
to elect someone who is grossly incompetent and worse than incompetent,

19:23.940 --> 19:31.860
genuinely malevolent in his selfishness. And this is something we know based on literally decades

19:31.860 --> 19:39.220
of him being in the public eye. He's not a public servant in any normal sense of that term.

19:40.340 --> 19:46.660
And he couldn't possibly give an honest or sane answer to the question you asked me about empathy

19:46.660 --> 19:56.420
and reason and what should guide us. I genuinely think he is missing some necessary moral and

19:56.420 --> 20:03.380
psychological tools. I can feel compassion for him as a human being because I think

20:04.100 --> 20:08.180
having those things is incredibly important and genuinely loving other people is incredibly

20:08.180 --> 20:13.060
important. And knowing what all that's about, that's really the good stuff in life and I

20:15.300 --> 20:21.540
think he's missing a lot of that. But I think we don't want to promote people to the highest

20:21.540 --> 20:31.220
positions of power in our society who are far outliers in pathological terms. We want them to

20:31.220 --> 20:38.820
be far outliers in the best case in wisdom and compassion and some of the topics you've brought

20:38.820 --> 20:47.620
up. We want someone to be deeply informed. We want someone to be unusually curious, unusually alert

20:47.620 --> 20:52.820
to how they may be wrong or getting things wrong consequentially. He's none of those things.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.300
Insofar as we're going to get normal mediocrities in that role, which I think

20:57.860 --> 21:02.820
is often the best we could expect, let's get normal mediocrities in that role, not

21:04.260 --> 21:14.980
once in a generation narcissists and frauds. We just take honesty as a single variable.

21:15.380 --> 21:23.060
I think it's possible that most politicians lie at least some of the time. I don't think that's a

21:23.060 --> 21:31.860
good thing. I think people should be generally honest even to a fault. Yes, there are certain

21:31.860 --> 21:37.060
circumstances where lying I think is necessary. It's kind of on a continuum of self-defense and

21:37.060 --> 21:43.300
violence. So if the Nazis come to your door and ask you if you've got Anne Frank in the attic,

21:43.300 --> 21:54.020
I think it's okay to lie to them. Arguably, there's never been a person that anyone could

21:54.020 --> 22:03.300
name in human history who's lied with that kind of velocity. He was just a blizzard of lies,

22:03.300 --> 22:15.460
great and small, to pointless and effective, but it says something

22:18.580 --> 22:23.540
fairly alarming about our society that a person of that character got promoted.

22:24.900 --> 22:29.380
Yes, I have compassion and concern for half of the society who didn't see it that way,

22:29.380 --> 22:36.420
and that's going to sound elitist and smug or something for anyone who's on that side listening

22:36.420 --> 22:44.020
to me, but it's genuine. I understand that I'm like one of the luckiest people in the world,

22:44.020 --> 22:48.580
and I barely have the bandwidth to pay attention to half the things I should pay attention to in

22:48.580 --> 22:53.700
order to have an opinion about half the things we're going to talk about. So how much less

22:53.700 --> 23:03.300
bandwidth is somebody who's working two jobs or a single mom who's raising multiple kids,

23:03.300 --> 23:10.020
even a single kid. It's unimaginable to me that people have the bandwidth to really track this

23:10.020 --> 23:15.140
stuff. And so then they jump on social media and they get inundated by misinformation and

23:15.700 --> 23:21.060
they see what their favorite influencer just said, and now they're worried about vaccines.

23:24.020 --> 23:28.820
We're living in an environment where the information space has become so corrupted,

23:29.620 --> 23:34.900
and we've built machines to further corrupt it. We've built a business model for the internet

23:34.900 --> 23:44.580
that further corrupts it. So it's chaos in informational terms, and I don't fault people

23:44.580 --> 23:56.420
for being confused and impatient and at their wits end. And yes, Trump was an enormous fuck you

23:56.420 --> 24:01.060
to the establishment, and that was understandable for many reasons.

24:01.060 --> 24:06.420
AC To me, Sam Harris, the great Sam Harris is somebody I've looked up to for a long time

24:07.460 --> 24:13.140
as a beacon of voice of reason. And there's this meme on the internet, and I would love you to

24:13.140 --> 24:19.700
steel man the case for it and against that Trump broke Sam Harris's brain. That there's something

24:20.420 --> 24:27.940
is disproportionately to the actual impact that Trump had on our society. He had an impact on the

24:29.220 --> 24:36.900
ability of balanced, calm, rational minds to see the world clearly, to think clearly,

24:37.540 --> 24:42.900
you being one of the beacons of that. Is there a degree to which he broke your brain?

24:43.140 --> 24:47.460
AC Otherwise known as Trump Derangement Syndrome,

24:48.180 --> 24:51.300
medical condition. AC Yeah, I think Trump Derangement

24:51.300 --> 24:58.740
Syndrome is a very clever meme because it just throws the problem back on the person who's

24:58.740 --> 25:05.460
criticizing Trump. But in truth, the true Trump Derangement Syndrome was not to have seen

25:06.260 --> 25:12.260
how dangerous and divisive it would be to promote someone like Trump to that position of power,

25:12.900 --> 25:25.140
and in the final moment, not to see how untenable it was to still support a sitting president who

25:25.140 --> 25:29.860
was not committing to a peaceful transfer of power. If that wasn't a bright line for you,

25:30.500 --> 25:38.260
you have been deranged by something because that was one minute to midnight for our democracy,

25:38.260 --> 25:48.180
as far as I'm concerned. And I think it really was but for the integrity of a few people that

25:48.180 --> 25:56.580
we didn't suffer some real constitutional crisis and real emergency after January 6. If Mike Pence

25:56.580 --> 26:03.940
had caved in and decided to not certify the election, literally you can count on two hands

26:03.940 --> 26:10.980
the number of people who held things together at that moment. It wasn't for want of trying

26:10.980 --> 26:21.940
on Trump's part that we didn't succumb to some real truly uncharted catastrophe with our democracy.

26:21.940 --> 26:28.580
So the fact that that didn't happen is not a sign that those of us who were worried that it was

26:29.460 --> 26:34.660
so close to happening were exaggerating the problem. You almost got run over by a car,

26:35.460 --> 26:41.140
but you didn't. The fact that you're adrenalized and you're thinking, boy, that was dangerous,

26:41.140 --> 26:47.860
I probably shouldn't wander in the middle of the street with my eyes closed. You weren't wrong

26:47.860 --> 26:55.380
to feel that you really had a problem and came very close to something truly terrible.

26:56.020 --> 27:00.580
So I think that's where we were and I think we shouldn't do that again. So the fact that he's

27:00.580 --> 27:05.620
still coming back around as potentially a viable candidate. I'm not spending much time thinking

27:05.620 --> 27:10.500
about it, frankly, because I'm waiting for the moment where it requires some thought.

27:13.860 --> 27:23.060
It took up, I don't know how many podcasts I devoted to the topic. It wasn't that many in

27:23.060 --> 27:29.700
the end against the number of podcasts I devoted to other topics, but there are people who look at

27:29.700 --> 27:39.620
Trump and just find him funny, entertaining, not especially threatening. It's just good fun to see

27:39.620 --> 27:47.220
somebody who's just not taking anything seriously and is just putting a stick in the wheel of

27:47.220 --> 27:54.180
business as usual again and again and again and again. They don't really see anything

27:54.820 --> 28:00.420
much at stake. It doesn't really matter if we don't support NATO. It doesn't really matter if

28:00.420 --> 28:07.380
he says he trusts Putin more than our intelligence services. It doesn't matter if he's on the one

28:07.380 --> 28:16.100
hand saying that he loves the leader of North Korea and on the other threatens to bomb them

28:16.100 --> 28:21.940
back to the stone age on Twitter. It all can be taken in the spirit of reality television.

28:21.940 --> 28:28.900
It's like this is the part of the movie that's just fun to watch. I understand that I can even

28:28.900 --> 28:36.020
inhabit that space for a few minutes at a time, but there's a deeper concern that we're in the

28:36.020 --> 28:41.140
process of entertaining ourselves to death, that we're just not taking things seriously.

28:41.700 --> 28:47.220
It's a problem I've had with several other people we might name who just appear to me to be

28:48.020 --> 28:55.300
goofing around at scale and they lack a kind of moral seriousness. They're touching big problems

28:55.300 --> 29:01.140
where lives hang in the balance, but they're just fucking around. I think there are really

29:01.140 --> 29:07.940
important problems that we have to get our heads straight around. It's not to say that

29:07.940 --> 29:14.500
institutions don't become corrupt. I think they do and I'm quite worried that both about the loss

29:14.500 --> 29:21.540
of trust in our institutions and the fact that trust has eroded for good reason, that they have

29:21.540 --> 29:28.340
become less trustworthy. They've become infected by political ideologies that are not truth tracking.

29:28.340 --> 29:36.020
I worry about all of that, but I just think we need institutions. We need to rebuild them.

29:36.020 --> 29:45.140
We need experts who are real experts. We need to value expertise over amateurish speculation

29:45.140 --> 29:50.820
and conspiracy thinking and bullshit. What kind of amateur speculation

29:50.820 --> 29:56.580
we're doing on this very podcast? I'm usually alert to the moments where I'm

29:57.620 --> 30:03.300
just guessing or where I actually feel like I'm talking from within my wheelhouse. I try to

30:03.300 --> 30:15.460
telegraph that a fair amount with people. It's different. You can invite someone onto your podcast

30:15.460 --> 30:23.540
who's an expert about something that you're not an expert about and then you, in the process of

30:23.540 --> 30:29.060
getting more informed yourself, your audience is getting more informed. You're asking smart questions

30:29.060 --> 30:34.580
and you might be pushing back at the margins, but you know that when push comes to shove on that

30:34.580 --> 30:42.340
topic, you really don't have a basis to have a strong opinion. If you were going to form a

30:43.300 --> 30:46.740
strong opinion that was this counter to the expert you have in front of you,

30:46.740 --> 30:50.980
it's going to be by deference to some other expert who you've brought in or who you've

30:50.980 --> 30:58.180
heard about or whose work you've read or whatever. There's a paradox to how we value authority

30:58.180 --> 31:03.300
in science that most people don't understand. I think we should at some point unravel that

31:03.300 --> 31:08.500
because it's the basis for a lot of public confusion and frankly, it's the basis for a

31:08.500 --> 31:17.140
lot of criticism I've received on these topics where people think that I'm against free speech

31:17.140 --> 31:23.860
or I'm an establishment shill or it's like I just think I'm a credentialist. I just think people

31:23.860 --> 31:30.020
with PhDs from Ivy League universities should run everything. It's not true, but there's a

31:30.020 --> 31:34.500
ton of confusion. There's a lot to cut through to get to daylight there because people are

31:36.980 --> 31:41.940
very confused about how we value authority in the service of rationality generally.

31:41.940 --> 31:46.820
You've talked about it, but it's just interesting the intensity of feeling you have. You've had this

31:47.780 --> 31:54.660
famous phrase about Hunter Biden and children in the basement. Can you just revisit this case?

31:56.660 --> 32:01.540
Let me give another perspective on the situation of January 6th and Trump in general.

32:03.140 --> 32:10.340
It's possible that January 6th and things of that nature revealed that our democracy is actually

32:10.340 --> 32:17.780
pretty fragile. Then Trump is not an ultra competent malevolent figure, but is simply

32:17.780 --> 32:24.740
a jokester. He just by creating the chaos revealed that it's all pretty fragile

32:24.740 --> 32:28.740
because you're a student of history and there's a lot of people like Vladimir Lenin,

32:28.740 --> 32:35.940
Hitler who are exceptionally competent at controlling power, at being executives and

32:35.940 --> 32:40.340
taking that power, controlling the generals, controlling all the figures involved,

32:40.340 --> 32:45.700
and certainly not tweeting, but working in the shadows behind the scenes to gain power.

32:46.420 --> 32:51.540
They did so extremely competently and that is how they were able to gain power.

32:51.540 --> 32:58.340
The pushback with Trump is he was doing none of that. He was creating what he's very good at,

32:58.340 --> 33:03.140
creating drama, sometimes for humor's sake, sometimes for drama's sake,

33:03.140 --> 33:10.340
and simply revealed that our democracy is fragile. He's not this once in a generation

33:10.340 --> 33:20.100
horrible figure, once in a generation narcissist. I don't think he's a truly scary, sinister,

33:21.700 --> 33:27.540
Putin-like or much less Hitler-like figure, not at all. He's not ideological. He doesn't care about

33:27.540 --> 33:38.420
anything beyond himself. He's much less scary than any really scary totalitarian.

33:40.420 --> 33:42.740
He's more brave new world than 1984.

33:42.740 --> 33:50.100
This is what Eric Weinstein never stops badgering me about, but he's still wrong, Eric.

33:52.900 --> 33:56.980
My analogy for Trump was that he's an evil Chauncey Gardner. I don't know if you remember

33:58.500 --> 34:05.300
the book or the film Being There with Peter Sellers. Peter Sellers is this gardener who

34:05.300 --> 34:11.300
really doesn't know anything, but he gets recognized as this wise man and he gets promoted to immense

34:11.300 --> 34:18.980
power in Washington because he's speaking in a semblance of wisdom. He's got these very simple

34:18.980 --> 34:24.020
aphorisms or what seem to be aphorisms. All he cares about is gardening. He's just talking

34:24.020 --> 34:29.300
about his garden all the time, but he'll say something, but in the spring, the new shoots

34:29.300 --> 34:35.540
will bloom and people read into that some kind of genius insight politically, and so he gets

34:35.540 --> 34:40.580
promoted and so that's the joke of the film. For me, Trump has always been someone like

34:40.580 --> 34:47.300
an evil Chauncey Gardner. It's not to say he's totally, yes, he has a certain kind of genius.

34:47.300 --> 34:53.620
He's got a genius for creating a spectacle around himself. He's got a genius for getting the eye of

34:53.620 --> 35:04.100
the media always coming back to him, but it's a kind of self-promotion that only works if you

35:04.100 --> 35:10.740
actually are truly shameless and don't care about having a reputation for anything that I or you

35:10.740 --> 35:17.060
would want to have a reputation for. It's like the pure pornography of attention and he just wants

35:17.060 --> 35:25.780
more of it. I think the truly depressing and genuinely scary thing was that we have a country

35:25.780 --> 35:33.220
that at least half of the country, given how broken our society is in many ways,

35:33.780 --> 35:41.460
we have a country that didn't see anything wrong with that, bringing someone who obviously doesn't

35:41.460 --> 35:47.620
know what he should know to be president and who's obviously not a good person. He obviously

35:47.620 --> 35:53.060
doesn't care about people, can't even pretend to care about people really in a credible way.

35:56.580 --> 36:03.140
If there's a silver lining to this, it's along the lines you just sketched, it shows us how

36:03.140 --> 36:10.980
vulnerable our system is to a truly brilliant and sinister figure. I think we are

36:12.420 --> 36:21.060
really dodged a bullet. Yes, someone far more competent and conniving and ideological could

36:21.060 --> 36:31.140
have exploited our system in a way that Trump didn't. If we plug those holes eventually,

36:32.340 --> 36:35.140
that would be a good thing and he would have done a good thing for our society.

36:36.020 --> 36:41.300
One of the things we realized, I think nobody knew, I certainly didn't know it and I didn't

36:41.300 --> 36:48.580
hear anyone talk about it, is how much our system relies on norms rather than laws.

36:48.580 --> 36:50.020
Yes, civility almost.

36:50.020 --> 36:58.740
Yeah, it's quite possible that he never did anything illegal, truly illegal. I think he

36:58.740 --> 37:03.860
probably did a few illegal things, but illegal such that he really should be thrown in jail for it.

37:06.100 --> 37:11.700
At least that remains to be seen. All of the chaos, all of the

37:14.900 --> 37:20.980
diminishment of our stature in the world, all of just the opportunity costs of spending years

37:20.980 --> 37:30.020
focused on nonsense, all of that was just norm violations. That was just all a matter of not

37:30.740 --> 37:34.260
saying the thing you should say, but that doesn't mean they're insignificant.

37:34.260 --> 37:41.860
It's not illegal for a sitting president to say, no, I'm not going to commit to a

37:41.860 --> 37:45.860
peaceful transfer of power. We'll wait and see whether I win. If I win,

37:48.500 --> 37:52.420
the election was valid. If I lose, it was fraudulent.

37:53.300 --> 38:00.660
Aren't those humorous perturbations to our system of civility such that we know what the limits are

38:00.660 --> 38:03.860
and now we start to think that and have these kinds of discussions?

38:04.260 --> 38:10.420
Wasn't a humorous perturbation because he did everything he could. Granted, he wasn't very

38:10.420 --> 38:17.700
competent, but he did everything he could to try to steal the election. The irony is he claimed to

38:17.700 --> 38:22.900
have an election stolen from him all the while doing everything he could to steal it, declaring

38:22.900 --> 38:29.620
it fraudulent in advance, trying to get the votes to not be counted as the evening wore on, knowing

38:29.620 --> 38:37.220
that they were going to be disproportionately Democrat votes because of the position he took

38:37.220 --> 38:46.900
on mail-in ballots. All of it was fairly calculated. The whole circus of the clown car that crashed

38:46.900 --> 38:53.540
into Four Seasons landscaping. You got Rudy Giuliani with his hair dye and you got Sidney Powell

38:53.540 --> 39:00.740
and all these grossly incompetent people lying as freely as they could breathe about election

39:00.740 --> 39:06.420
fraud. All of these things are getting thrown out by Republican, largely Republican election

39:06.420 --> 39:13.860
officials and Republican judges. It wasn't for want of trying that he didn't maintain his power

39:13.860 --> 39:18.820
in this country. He really tried to steal the presidency. He just was not competent and the

39:18.820 --> 39:24.580
people around him weren't competent. That's a good thing and it's worth not letting that happen

39:24.580 --> 39:29.220
again. But he wasn't competent, so he didn't do everything he could. Well, no, he did everything

39:29.220 --> 39:32.980
he could. He didn't do everything that could have been done by someone more competent.

39:34.660 --> 39:39.220
Right, but the tools you have as a president, you could do a lot of things. You can declare

39:39.220 --> 39:43.780
emergencies, especially during COVID. You could postpone the election. You can create military

39:43.780 --> 39:48.420
conflict. Any kind of reason to postpone the election. There's a lot of-

39:48.820 --> 39:52.820
But he tried to do things and he would have to have done those things through other people

39:52.820 --> 39:56.820
and there are people who refused to do those things. There are people who said they would

39:56.820 --> 40:06.100
quit. They would quit publicly. Again, there are multiple books written about the last hours of

40:06.100 --> 40:13.380
this presidency and the details are shocking in what he tried to do and tried to get others to do

40:13.380 --> 40:19.860
and it's awful. It's just awful that we were that close to something,

40:22.900 --> 40:28.820
to a true unraveling of our political process. It's the only time in our lifetime that anything

40:28.820 --> 40:37.140
like this has happened and it's deeply embarrassing on the world stage. It's just like we looked like

40:37.140 --> 40:46.900
a banana republic there for a while and we're the lone superpower. It's not good.

40:50.340 --> 40:55.060
The people who thought, well, we just need to shake things up and this is a great way to shake

40:55.060 --> 41:00.740
things up and having people storm our Capitol and smear shit on the walls, that's just more

41:00.740 --> 41:09.140
shaking things up. It's all just for the lulls. There's a nihilism and cynicism to all of that,

41:09.140 --> 41:13.860
which again, in certain people, it's understandable. Frankly, it's not understandable

41:13.860 --> 41:19.780
if you've got a billion dollars and you have a compound in Menlo Park or wherever. There are

41:19.780 --> 41:24.180
people who are cheerleading this stuff who shouldn't be cheerleading this stuff and who know that they

41:24.180 --> 41:28.980
can get on their Gulfstream and fly to their compound in New Zealand if everything goes to

41:28.980 --> 41:35.380
shit. There's a cynicism to all of that that I think we should be deeply critical of.

41:35.380 --> 41:42.020
What I'm trying to understand and analyze is not the behavior of this particular human being,

41:42.020 --> 41:50.340
but the effect it had in part on the division between people. To me, the degree, the meme

41:51.220 --> 41:57.460
of Sam Harris's brain being broken by Trump represents you're like the person I would look

41:57.460 --> 42:06.820
to to bridge the division. Well, I don't think there is something profitably to be said to

42:06.820 --> 42:14.100
someone who's truly captivated by the personality cult of Trumpism. There's nothing that I'm going

42:14.100 --> 42:19.300
to say to, there's no conversation I'm going to have with Candace Owens, say, about Trump

42:19.300 --> 42:22.820
that's going to converge on something reasonable. You don't think so?

42:22.820 --> 42:26.180
No, I haven't tried with Candace but I've tried with many people who

42:27.380 --> 42:33.860
are in that particular orbit. I've had conversations with people who won't admit

42:33.860 --> 42:40.420
that there's anything wrong with Trump, anything. I'd like to push for the empathy versus reason

42:40.420 --> 42:47.060
because when you operate in the space of reason, yes, but I think there's a lot of power in you

42:47.060 --> 42:52.020
showing, in you, Sam Harris, showing that you're willing to see the good qualities of Trump,

42:52.580 --> 42:56.500
publicly showing that. I think that's the way to win over the Candace Owens.

42:56.500 --> 43:01.300
But he has so few of them. He has fewer good qualities than virtually anyone I can name.

43:03.220 --> 43:07.940
He's funny. I'll grant you that he's funny. He's a good entertainer.

43:07.940 --> 43:11.380
There's others. Look at just policies and actual impacts he had.

43:11.380 --> 43:16.020
I've admitted that. No, no. I've admitted that many of his policies I agree with.

43:16.980 --> 43:24.740
Many, many of his policies. Probably more often than not, at least on balance, I agreed with his

43:24.740 --> 43:35.780
policy that we should take China seriously as an adversary. There's a lot of fine print to a lot

43:35.780 --> 43:41.060
of this because the way he talks about these things and many of his motives that are obvious

43:41.060 --> 43:47.620
are things that I don't support, but take immigration. I think it's obvious that we

43:47.620 --> 43:54.260
should have control of our borders. I don't see the argument for not having control of our borders.

43:54.260 --> 43:58.500
We should let in who we want to let in and we should keep out who we want to keep out

43:58.500 --> 44:04.100
and we should have a sane immigration policy. I didn't necessarily think it was a priority

44:04.100 --> 44:09.460
to build the wall, but I never criticized the impulse to build the wall because if

44:10.180 --> 44:13.940
tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are coming across that border and we are not in a

44:13.940 --> 44:21.140
position to know who's coming, that seems untenable to me. I can recognize that many people

44:21.140 --> 44:29.140
in our society are on balance, the victims of immigration. There is, in many cases,

44:29.140 --> 44:34.020
a zero-sum contest between the interests of actual citizens and the interests of immigrants.

44:34.980 --> 44:39.620
I think we should have control of our borders. We should have a sane and compassionate

44:39.620 --> 44:45.860
immigration policy. We should let in refugees. Trump on refugees was terrible.

44:49.700 --> 45:02.180
I would say 80% of the policy concerns people celebrated in him are concerns that I either share

45:02.900 --> 45:09.780
entirely or certainly sympathize with. That's not the issue. The issue is-

45:10.580 --> 45:12.820
A threat to democracy in some fundamental way.

45:12.820 --> 45:18.340
The issue is largely what you said it was. It's not so much the person, it's the effect on

45:18.340 --> 45:26.500
everything he touches. He has this superpower of deranging and destabilizing

45:27.140 --> 45:32.740
almost everything he touches and compromising the integrity of almost anyone who comes into his

45:32.740 --> 45:39.380
orbit. As you looked at these people who served as chief of staff or in various cabinet positions,

45:39.380 --> 45:46.820
people had real reputations for probity and level-headedness, whether you shared their

45:46.820 --> 45:53.380
politics or not. These were real people. Some of them were goofballs, but

45:53.380 --> 46:02.500
many people who just got totally trashed by proximity to him and then trashed by him when

46:02.500 --> 46:09.940
they finally parted company with him. Yeah, I mean, it's just people bent over backwards

46:09.940 --> 46:18.980
to accommodate his norm violations. It was bad for them and it was bad for our system.

46:19.220 --> 46:23.220
It was bad for them and it was bad for our system.

46:26.420 --> 46:35.300
None of that discounts the fact that we have a system that really needs a proper house cleaning.

46:35.300 --> 46:42.660
Yes, there are bad incentives and entrenched interests. I'm not a fan of the concept of

46:43.620 --> 46:50.660
the deep state because it's been so propagandized, but yes, there's something like that that is

46:51.860 --> 47:01.220
not flexible enough to respond intelligently to the needs of the moment. There's a lot of

47:01.220 --> 47:08.260
rethinking of government and of institutions in general that I think we should do, but we need

47:08.260 --> 47:14.740
smart, well-informed, well-intentioned people to do that job. The well-intentioned part is

47:15.860 --> 47:26.660
hugely important. Just give me someone who is not the most selfish person anyone has ever

47:27.220 --> 47:33.780
heard about in their lifetime. What we got with Trump was literally the one most selfish person

47:33.780 --> 47:39.140
I think anyone could name. Again, there's so much known about this man. That's the thing.

47:40.180 --> 47:47.940
It predates his presidency. We knew this guy 30 years ago. This is why, to come back to those

47:47.940 --> 47:53.300
inflammatory comments about Hunter Biden's laptop, the reason why I can say with confidence that I

47:53.300 --> 48:01.380
don't care what was on his laptop is that includes any evidence of corruption on the part of his

48:01.380 --> 48:08.100
father. Now, there's been precious little of that that's actually emerged. As far as I can tell,

48:08.660 --> 48:13.380
there's not a big story associated with that laptop as much as people bang on about a few emails,

48:14.100 --> 48:22.100
but even if there were just obvious corruption, like Joe Biden was at this meeting and he took

48:22.100 --> 48:30.900
this amount of money from this shady guy for bad reasons, given how visible the lives of these two

48:30.900 --> 48:35.700
men have been, given how much we know about Joe Biden and how much we know about Donald Trump and

48:35.700 --> 48:43.140
how they have lived in public for almost as long as I've been alive, both of them, the scale of

48:43.140 --> 48:50.340
corruption can't possibly balance out between the two of them. If you show me that Joe Biden has

48:50.340 --> 48:56.820
this secret life where he's driving a Bugatti and he's living like Andrew Tate and he's doing

48:56.820 --> 49:01.380
all these things I didn't know about, okay, then I'm going to start getting a sense that,

49:01.380 --> 49:06.740
all right, maybe this guy is way more corrupt than I realized. Maybe there is some deal in Ukraine

49:06.740 --> 49:12.100
or with China that is just like this guy is not who he seems, he's not the public servant he's

49:12.100 --> 49:18.020
been pretending to be, he's been on the take for decades and decades and he's as dirty as can be,

49:18.020 --> 49:24.020
he's all mobbed up and it's a nightmare and he can't be trusted. That's possible

49:24.900 --> 49:29.540
if you show me that his life is not at all what it seems, but on the assumption

49:29.540 --> 49:36.100
that having looked at this guy for literally decades and knowing that every journalist has

49:36.100 --> 49:43.220
looked at him for decades, just how many affairs is he having, just how many drugs is he doing,

49:43.220 --> 49:49.300
how many houses does he have, what are the obvious conflicts of interest?

49:50.180 --> 49:58.100
You hold that against what we know about Trump and the litany of indiscretions you can put on

49:58.100 --> 50:03.540
Trump's side that testify to his personal corruption, to testify to the fact that he

50:03.540 --> 50:09.060
has no ethical compass, there's simply no comparison. That's why I don't care about

50:09.060 --> 50:15.620
what's on the laptop. Now, if you tell me Trump is no longer running for president in 2024

50:15.700 --> 50:19.460
and we can put Trumpism behind us and now you're saying,

50:20.260 --> 50:25.460
listen, there's a lot of stuff on that laptop that makes Joe Biden look like a total asshole.

50:25.460 --> 50:32.740
Okay, I'm all ears. In 2020, it was a forced choice between a sitting president who wouldn't

50:32.740 --> 50:38.500
commit to a peaceful transfer of power and a guy who's obviously too old to be president,

50:38.980 --> 50:50.260
who has a crack addicted son who lost his laptop and I just knew that I was going to take Biden

50:50.260 --> 50:54.100
in spite of whatever litany of horrors was going to come tumbling out of that laptop.

50:54.100 --> 50:58.980
And that might involve sort of, so the actual quote is Hunter Biden literally could have had

50:58.980 --> 51:04.180
the corpses of children in the basement. There's a dark humor to it, right? Which is, I think you

51:04.260 --> 51:09.140
speak to, I would not have cared. There's nothing, it's Hunter Biden, it's not Joe Biden. Whatever

51:09.140 --> 51:13.620
the scope of Joe Biden's corruption is, it is infinitesimally compared to the corruption

51:13.620 --> 51:18.180
we know Trump was involved in. It's like a firefly to the sun is what you're speaking to.

51:18.180 --> 51:25.940
But let me make the case that you're really focused on the surface stuff, that it's possible

51:25.940 --> 51:32.740
to have corruption that masquerades in the thing we mentioned, which is civility. You can spend

51:32.740 --> 51:38.740
hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions towards the war in the Middle East, for example,

51:38.740 --> 51:43.300
something that you've changed your mind on in terms of the negative impact it has on the world.

51:43.940 --> 51:50.260
That, the military industrial complex, everybody's very nice, everybody's very civil,

51:50.260 --> 51:55.860
they're very upfront. Here's how we're spending the money. Yeah, it's sometimes somehow disappears

51:55.860 --> 52:00.660
in different places, but that's the way war is complicated. And everyone is very polite.

52:00.660 --> 52:07.060
There's no coke and strippers or whatever is on the laptop. It's very nice and polite.

52:07.060 --> 52:14.180
In the meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of civilians die of hate. Just an incredible

52:14.180 --> 52:18.100
amount of hate is created because people lose their family members, all that kind of stuff,

52:18.100 --> 52:25.220
but there's no strippers and coke on a laptop. Yeah, but it's not just superficial. It is

52:25.700 --> 52:35.460
when someone only wants wealth and power and fame. That is their objective function. They're like a

52:36.180 --> 52:44.900
robot that is calibrated just to those variables. And they don't care about the risks we run on any

52:44.900 --> 52:52.260
other front. They don't care about environmental risk, pandemic risk, nuclear proliferation risk,

52:52.900 --> 53:00.740
none of it. They're just tracking fame and money and whatever can personally

53:01.940 --> 53:06.660
redound to their self-interest along those lines. And they're not informed about the other risks

53:06.660 --> 53:12.580
we're running really. In Trump, you had a president who was repeatedly asking his generals,

53:12.580 --> 53:17.220
why couldn't we use our nuclear weapons? Why can't we have more of them? Why do I have fewer nuclear

53:17.220 --> 53:22.980
weapons than JFK? As though that were a sign of anything other than progress.

53:26.420 --> 53:32.660
And this is the guy who's got the button. Somebody's following him around with a bag

53:32.660 --> 53:45.300
waiting to take his order to launch. It's a risk we should never run. One thing Trump has going

53:45.300 --> 53:51.700
for him, I think, is that he doesn't drink or do drugs. People allegedly he does speed, but

53:53.060 --> 54:01.540
let's take him at his word. He's not deranging himself with pharmaceuticals at least, apart from

54:01.540 --> 54:08.020
Diet Coke. There's nothing wrong. Just for the record, let me push back on that. There's nothing

54:08.020 --> 54:12.020
wrong with Diet Coke. I've been consuming a very large amount. I occasionally have some myself.

54:12.820 --> 54:17.940
There's no scientific evidence that I observed the negatives of all those studies about aspartame

54:17.940 --> 54:25.700
and all that. No, I don't know. I hope you're right. Everything you said about the military

54:25.700 --> 54:32.740
industrial complex is true. We've been worrying about that on both sides of the aisle for a very

54:32.740 --> 54:47.540
long time. That phrase came from Eisenhower. So much of what ails us is a story of bad incentives.

54:49.540 --> 54:57.140
Bad incentives are so powerful that they corrupt even good people. How much more do they corrupt

54:57.140 --> 55:04.980
bad people? At minimum, you want reasonably good people, at least non-pathological people,

55:06.020 --> 55:13.380
in the system trying to navigate against the grain of bad incentives. Better still,

55:14.340 --> 55:21.380
all of us can get together and try to diagnose those incentives and change them. We will really

55:21.380 --> 55:27.460
succeed when we have a system of incentives where the good incentives are so strong

55:28.740 --> 55:34.980
that even bad people are effortlessly behaving as though they're good people because they're so

55:34.980 --> 55:42.420
successfully incentivized to behave that way. It's almost the inversion of our current situation.

55:42.420 --> 55:49.300
So yes, and you say I changed my mind about the war. Not quite. I was never

55:50.260 --> 55:55.460
a supporter of the war in Iraq. I was always worried that it was a distraction from the war

55:55.460 --> 55:59.940
in Afghanistan. I was a supporter of the war in Afghanistan, and I will admit in hindsight,

55:59.940 --> 56:09.700
that looks like at best a highly ambiguous and painful exercise, more likely a fool's errand.

56:10.020 --> 56:18.260
It did not turn out well. It wasn't for want of trying. I have not done a deep dive on

56:19.300 --> 56:23.940
all of the failures there, and maybe all of these failures are failures in principle.

56:23.940 --> 56:29.860
I mean, maybe that's not the kind of thing that can be done well by anybody, whatever our intentions.

56:31.540 --> 56:39.300
But yeah, the move to Iraq always seemed questionable to me. When we knew the problem,

56:39.380 --> 56:48.340
the immediate problem at that moment, Al-Qaeda was in Afghanistan and then bounced into Pakistan.

56:50.740 --> 56:56.980
Anyway, so yes, but my sense of the possibility of nation building,

56:57.540 --> 57:11.780
my sense of insofar as the neocon spirit of responsibility and idealism, that America was

57:11.780 --> 57:16.980
the kind of nation that should be functioning in this way as the world's cop, and we have to get

57:16.980 --> 57:25.780
in there and untangle some of these knots by force rather often because if we don't do it over there,

57:25.780 --> 57:30.660
we're going to have to do it over here kind of thing. Yeah, some of that has definitely

57:30.660 --> 57:36.500
changed for me in my thinking. There are obviously cultural reasons why it failed in Afghanistan,

57:36.500 --> 57:45.300
and if you can't change the culture, you're not going to force a change at gunpoint in the

57:45.300 --> 57:52.660
culture. It certainly seems that that's not going to happen, and it took us over 20 years apparently

57:52.660 --> 57:56.260
to realize that. That's one of the things you realize with the wars. There's not going to be

57:56.260 --> 58:01.860
a strong signal that things are not working if you just keep pouring money into a thing, a military

58:01.860 --> 58:07.700
effort. Well, also there are signs of it working too. You have all the stories of girls now going

58:07.700 --> 58:12.740
to school. The girls are getting battery acid thrown in their faces by religious maniacs,

58:12.740 --> 58:18.340
and then we come in there and we stop that, and now girls are getting educated, and that's all

58:18.340 --> 58:23.140
good, and our intentions are good there. We're on the right side of history there. Girls should be

58:23.140 --> 58:29.140
going to school. Malala Yousafzai should have the Nobel Prize, and she shouldn't have been shot in

58:29.140 --> 58:37.060
the face by the Taliban. We know what the right answers are there. The question is, what do you

58:37.060 --> 58:43.220
do when there are enough, in this particular case, religious maniacs who are willing to die and let

58:43.220 --> 58:49.540
their children die in defense of crazy ideas and moral norms that belong in the 7th century?

58:52.020 --> 58:55.220
It's a problem we couldn't solve, and we couldn't solve it even though we spent

58:56.260 --> 59:04.660
trillions of dollars to solve it. This reminded me of the thing that you and Jack Dorsey jokingly

59:04.660 --> 59:11.300
had for a while, the discussion about banning Donald Trump from Twitter, but does any of it

59:11.300 --> 59:19.860
bother you now that Twitter files came out? I mean, this has to do with the Hunter Biden laptop

59:19.860 --> 59:25.940
story. Does it bother you that there could be a collection of people that make decisions about

59:25.940 --> 59:34.100
who to ban and not, and that could be susceptible to bias and to ideological influence?

59:34.180 --> 59:41.780
Well, I think it always will be, or in the absence of perfect AI, it always will be.

59:41.780 --> 59:46.820
And this becomes relevant with AI as well, because there's some censorship on AI happening,

59:46.820 --> 59:48.500
and it's an interesting question there as well.

59:48.500 --> 59:54.100
I don't think Twitter is as important as people think it is. I used to think it was more important

59:54.100 --> 01:00:00.500
when I was on it, and now that I'm off of it, I think it's, I mean, first let me say it's just

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:08.980
an unambiguously good thing in my experience to lease your Twitter account. Even the good parts

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:17.220
of Twitter that I miss were bad in the aggregate, in the degree to which it was fragmenting my

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:25.620
attention, the degree to which my life was getting doled out to me in periods between those moments

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:33.540
where I checked Twitter and had my attention diverted. And I was not a crazy Twitter addict.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.780
I was probably a pretty normal user. I was not someone who was tweeting

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:46.260
multiple times a day or even every day. I think I probably averaged something like

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.660
one tweet a day, I think I averaged. But in reality, it would be like four tweets one day,

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:57.700
and then I wouldn't tweet for the better part of a week. But I was looking a lot because it was my

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:02.500
newsfeed. I was just following 200 very smart people, and I just wanted to see what they were

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:05.860
paying attention to. They would recommend articles, and I would read those articles.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.660
And then when I would read an article that I thought I should signal boost, I would tweet.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:16.900
And so all of that seemed good, and that's all separable from all of the odious bullshit that

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:25.060
came back at me largely in response to this Hunter Biden thing. But even the good stuff

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:35.940
has a downside, and it comes at just this point of your phone is this perpetual stimulus

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:44.500
which is intrinsically fragmenting of time and attention. And now my phone is much less

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:50.820
of a presence in my life. And it's not that I don't check Slack or check email. I use it to work,

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:58.980
but my sense of just what the world is and my sense of my place in the world, the sense of

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:08.420
where I exist as a person has changed a lot by deleting my Twitter account. And the things that

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:14.660
we all know this phenomenon. We say of someone, that person's too online. What does it mean to

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:23.060
be too online? And where do you draw that boundary? How do you know what constitutes being too online?

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:34.500
Well, in some sense, I think being on social media at all is to be too online. Given the kinds of

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:46.660
information it signal boosts, and given the impulse it kindles in each of us to reach out

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:54.980
to our audience in specific moments and in specific ways. There are lots of moments now

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:58.900
where I have an opinion about something, but there's nothing for me to do with that opinion.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:04.980
There's no Twitter. There are lots of things that I would have tweeted in the last months

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.060
that are not the kind of thing I'm going to do a podcast about. I'm not going to roll out 10

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:14.900
minutes on that topic on my podcast. I'm not going to take the time to really think about it.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.700
But had I been on Twitter, I would have reacted to this thing in the news or this thing that

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:23.300
somebody did. What do you do with that thought now?

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.460
I just let go of it. Chocolate ice cream is the most delicious thing ever.

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:33.700
It's usually not that sort of thing. But then you look at the kinds of problems people create

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:39.780
for themselves. You look at the life deranging and reputation destroying things that people do.

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:46.900
And I look at the analogous things that have happened to me, the things that have really

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:53.780
bent my life around professionally over the past decade. So much of it is Twitter.

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:59.780
Honestly, in my case, almost 100% of it was Twitter. The controversies I would get into,

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:05.300
the things I would think I would have to respond to. I would release a podcast on a certain topic.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:12.580
I would see some blowback on Twitter. It would give me the sense that there was some signal that

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:17.380
I really had to respond to. Now that I'm off Twitter, I recognize that most of that was just

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:22.020
totally specious. It was not something I had to respond to.

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:28.900
But yet I would then do a cycle of podcasts responding to that thing. Taking my foot out

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:35.060
of my mouth or taking someone else's foot out of my mouth. And it became this self-perpetuating

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:48.180
cycle. If you're having fun, great. If it's generative of useful information

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:53.460
and engagement professionally and psychologically, great.

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:03.060
There was some of that on Twitter. There were people who I connected with because one of us

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:07.060
DM'd the other on Twitter and it was hard to see how that was going to happen otherwise. But

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:15.860
it was largely just a machine for manufacturing unnecessary controversy.

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.660
Do you think it's possible to avoid the drug of that? Now that you've achieved this zen state,

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:26.020
is it possible for somebody like you to use it in a way that doesn't pull you into the whirlpool?

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.660
Anytime there's attacks, that's how I tried to use it.

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:37.460
Yeah, but it's not the way I wanted to use it. It's not the way it promises itself as a-

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.580
You wanted to have debate.

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:43.540
I wanted to actually communicate with people. I wanted to hear from the person because,

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:52.420
again, it's like being in Afghanistan. There are the potted cases where it's obviously good.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:58.020
It's like in Afghanistan, the girl who's getting an education, that's why we're here. That's

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:03.300
obviously good. I have those moments on Twitter where I'm hearing from a smart person who's

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:09.460
detected an error I made in my podcast or in a book, or they've just got some great idea about

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:15.140
something that I should spend time on. I would never have heard from this person in any other

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:20.020
format and now I'm actually in dialogue with them. It's fantastic. That's the promise of it,

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:29.060
to actually talk to people. I kept getting lured back into that. No, the same or sanity preserving

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:35.380
way of using it is just as a marketing channel. You just put your stuff out there and you don't

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:42.980
look at what's coming back at you. I'm on other social media platforms that I don't even touch.

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:48.180
My team posts stuff on Facebook and on Instagram. I never even see what's on there.

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:52.500
You don't think it's possible to see something and not let it affect your mind?

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:58.820
No, that's definitely possible. The question is, and I did that for vast stretches of time,

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:11.140
but then the promise of the platform is dialogue and feedback. If I know, for whatever reason,

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:19.460
I'm going to see 99 to 1 awful feedback, bad faith feedback, malicious feedback. Some of it's

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:24.500
probably even bots and I'm not even aware of who's a person, who's a bot, but I'm just going to stare

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:33.540
into this funhouse mirror of acrimony and dishonesty. The reason why I got off is

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:42.020
not because I couldn't recalibrate and find equanimity again with all the nastiness that

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:46.340
was coming back at me and not that I couldn't ignore it for vast stretches of time, but

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:53.700
I could see that I kept coming back to it, hoping that it would be something that I could use,

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:59.940
a real tool for communication, and I was noticing that it was insidiously changing

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:04.580
the way I felt about people, both people I know and people I don't know.

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:11.140
Mutual friends of ours who are behaving in certain ways on Twitter, which just seem insane to me,

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:17.060
and then that became a signal I felt like I had to take into account somehow. You're seeing people

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:25.060
at their worst, both friends and strangers, and I felt that as much as I could try to recalibrate

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:32.980
for it, I felt that I was losing touch with what was real information because people are performing,

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:37.460
people are faking, people are not themselves, or you're seeing people at their worst.

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:45.540
And so I felt like, all right, what's being advertised to me here on a, not just a daily

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:52.900
basis, an hourly basis, or an increment sometimes of multiple times an hour. I probably checked

01:08:52.900 --> 01:09:00.980
Twitter at minimum 10 times a day, and maybe I was checking it 100 times a day on some days,

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:03.620
where things were really active and I was really engaged with something.

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:19.140
What was being delivered into my brain there was subtly false information about how dishonest and

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:32.020
generally unethical, totally normal people are capable of being. It is a funhouse mirror.

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:38.340
I was seeing the most grotesque versions of people who I know. People who I know I could

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:43.940
sit down at dinner with and they would never behave this way, and yet they were coming at me

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:52.100
on Twitter. It was essentially turning ordinary people into sociopaths. People are just,

01:09:55.620 --> 01:10:00.980
there are analogies that many of us have made. One analogy is road rage. People behave in the

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:06.340
confines of a car in ways that they never would if they didn't have this metal box around them,

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:14.500
moving at speed. All of that becomes quite hilarious and obviously dysfunctional when

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.460
they actually have to stop at the light next to the person they just flipped off.

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.700
They didn't understand that the person coming out of that car next to them with cauliflower ear

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:28.660
is someone who they never would have rolled their eyes at in public because they would have taken

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.580
one look at this person and realized this is the last person you want to fight with.

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:38.340
That's one of the heartbreaking things is to see people who I know, who I admire, who I know are

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:49.940
friends be everything from snarky to downright mean derisive towards each other. It doesn't make any

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:56.580
sense. This is the only place where I've seen people I really admire who have had a calm head

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:01.460
about most things, like really be shitty to other people. It's probably the only place I've seen

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:07.780
that. I choose to maybe believe that that's not really them. There's something about the system.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:13.780
If you go paintballing, if you, Jordan Peterson, and go paintballing-

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:14.980
You're going to shoot your friends, yeah.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.860
Yeah, you're going to shoot your friends, but you kind of accept that that's kind of what you're

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:22.820
doing in this little game that you're playing, but it's sometimes hard to remind yourself of that.

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.820
Well, and I think I was guilty of that, definitely.

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:33.140
There's nothing, I don't think I ever did anything that I

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:40.580
really feel bad about, but yeah, it was always pushing me to the edge of snide-ness somehow,

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:50.820
and it's just not healthy. The reason why I deleted my Twitter account in the end was that

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:58.420
it was obviously making me a worse person. Is there some way to be on there where he's

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:03.860
not making you a worse person? I'm sure there is, but it's given the nature of the platform

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:09.380
and given what was coming back at me on it, the way to do that is just to basically

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:16.580
use it as a one-way channel of communication, just marketing. It's like, here's what I'm paying

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:21.380
attention to, look at it if you want to, and you just push it out, and then you don't look

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.780
at what's coming back at you. I put out a call for questions on Twitter, and then actually,

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:33.140
quite surprising, there's a lot of good, even if they're critical, they're being thoughtful,

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:37.860
which is nice. I used it that way too, and that was what kept me hooked. But then there's also

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:48.260
TouchBalls69 wrote a question. I can't imagine. One way to solve this is we've got to get rid of

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:53.060
anonymity for this. Let me ask the question. AskSamWhyHeSucks was the question.

01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:01.300
One reason why I sucked was Twitter, and I've since solved that problem. TouchBalls69

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:09.540
should be happy that I suck a little bit less now that I'm off Twitter. I don't have to hear

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:15.380
from TouchBalls69 on the regular. The fact that you have to see that,

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:22.980
it probably can have a negative effect, even in moderation, just to see that there is ... For me,

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:29.380
the negative effect is slightly losing faith in the underlying kindness of humanity.

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:34.100
That was for me, yeah. You can also just reason your way out of it, saying that this is anonymity,

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:40.500
and this is fun, and it's just the shit show of Twitter. It's okay, but it does mentally

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:49.700
affect you a little bit. I don't read too much into that kind of comment. That's just trolling.

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:56.340
I understand the fun the person is having on the other side of that.

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:57.540
Do you, though?

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:05.060
Well, I do. I don't behave that way, but I do. For all I know, that person could be 16 years old.

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.500
It could be also an alt account for Elon. I don't know.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:16.020
I'm pretty sure Elon would just tweet that under his own name at this point.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:24.580
You love each other. Speaking of which, now that Elon has taken over Twitter,

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.620
is there something that he could do to make this platform better?

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:35.460
This Twitter and just social media in general, but because of the aggressive nature of his

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:41.860
innovation that he's pushing, is there any way to make Twitter a pleasant place for Sam Harris?

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:44.900
Maybe.

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.100
Like in the next five years?

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.860
I don't know. I think I'm agnostic as to whether or not he or anyone could

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.060
make a social media platform that really was healthy.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:57.460
You were just observing yourself week by week, seeing the effect that has on your mind

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:01.940
and on how much you're actually learning and growing as a person, and it was negative.

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:07.860
Yeah. I'd also seen the negativity in other people's lives. He's not going to admit it,

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:16.980
but I think it's obviously negative for Elon. That was one of the things that when I was looking

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:21.940
into the funhouse mirror, I was also seeing the funhouse mirror on his side of Twitter,

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:27.860
and it was just even more exaggerated. When I was asking myself, why is he spending his time this

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:36.180
way, I then reflected on why was I spending my time this way to a lesser degree and at lesser

01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:49.700
scale and at lesser risk, frankly. It's not just Twitter. This is in part an internet phenomenon.

01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:59.060
It's like the whole Hunter Biden mess that you explored. I was on somebody's podcast,

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:04.420
but that was based on a clip taken from that podcast, which was highly misleading as to

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:11.380
the general shape of my remarks on that podcast. I had to then do my own podcast

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:17.860
untangling all of that and admitting that even in the full context, I was not speaking especially

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:23.780
well and didn't say exactly what I thought in a way that would have been recognizable to anyone,

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:31.780
even someone not functioning by a spirit of charity, but the clip was quite distinct from

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:38.260
the podcast itself. The reality is that we're living in an environment now where people are

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:47.220
so lazy and their attention is so fragmented that they only have time for clips. 99% of people

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:53.300
see a clip and will assume there's no relevant context I need to understand what happened in

01:16:53.300 --> 01:17:00.100
that clip. Obviously, the people who make those clips know that and they're doing it quite

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:04.100
maliciously. In this case, the person who made that clip and subsequent clips of other podcasts

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:11.700
was quite maliciously trying to engineer some reputational immolation for me.

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:21.220
And being signal-boosted by Elon and other prominent people who can't take the time

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:26.820
to watch anything other than a clip, even when it's their friend or someone who's ostensibly

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:32.260
their friend in that clip. So it's a total failure, an understandable failure of ethics

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:40.820
that everyone is so short on time and they're so lazy. And we now have these contexts in which

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:47.620
we react so quickly to things. Twitter is inviting an instantaneous reaction to this clip

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:58.180
that it's just too tempting to just say something and not know what you're even commenting on.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:05.380
Most of the people who saw that clip don't understand what I actually think about any

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:10.420
of these issues. And the irony is people are going to find clips from this conversation

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:13.700
that are just as misleading and they're going to export those and then people are going to

01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:21.700
be dunking on those clips. And we're all living and dying by clips now and it's dysfunctional.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:28.260
See, I think it's possible to create a platform. I think we will keep living on clips. But when

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:32.900
I saw that clip of you talking about children and so on, just knowing that you have a sense of humor,

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:39.380
we just went to a dark place in terms of humor. So I didn't even bother. And then I knew that

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:46.820
the way clips work is that people will use it for virality's sake. But giving a person benefit

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:53.220
of the doubt, that's not even the right term. It's not like I was really interpreting it

01:18:54.660 --> 01:19:03.300
in the context of knowing your past. I even give Trump the benefit of the doubt when I see a clip

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:08.020
of Trump. Because there are famous clips of Trump that are very misleading as to what he was saying

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:14.980
in context. And I've been honest about that. There were good people on both sides scandal

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:22.900
around his remarks after Charlottesville. The clip that got exported and got promoted by everyone

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:30.100
left of center, from Biden on down, the New York Times, CNN, there's nobody that I'm aware of

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:37.460
who has honestly apologized for what they did with that clip.

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:43.220
He did not say what he seemed to be saying in that clip about the Nazis at Charlottesville.

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:54.980
And I have always been very clear about that. Even people who I think should be marginalized

01:19:54.980 --> 01:20:03.300
and people who should be defenestrated because they really are terrible people who are doing

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:09.060
dangerous things and for bad reasons, I think we should be honest about what they actually

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:17.780
meant in context. And this goes to anyone else we might talk about who's more where the case is much

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:29.780
more confusing. I'm sure we're going to get to AI, but the prospect of being able to manufacture

01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:36.980
clips with AI and deep fakes where it's going to be hard for most people most of the time to

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:43.860
even figure out whether they're in the presence of something real, forget about being divorced

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:51.620
from context, there was no context. I mean, that's a misinformation apocalypse that is

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:58.180
we're right on the cusp of and it's terrifying. Or it could be just a new world like where Alice

01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:03.940
going to Wonderland where humor is the only thing we have and it will save us. Maybe in the end,

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:09.540
Trump's approach to social media was the right one after all, nothing is true and everything's absurd.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:15.060
No, but we can't live that way. People function on the basis of what they assume is true.

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:17.460
People have functioned.

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:24.340
To do anything. You have to know what you think is going to happen or you have to at least give a

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:30.500
probabilistic weighting over the future. Otherwise, you're going to be incapacitated.

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.780
People want certain things and they have to have a rational plan to get those

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:40.580
desires gratified. They don't want to die. They don't want their kids to die.

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:45.060
You tell them that there's a comet hurtling toward earth and they should get outside and look up.

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.660
They're going to do it and if it turns out it's misinformation,

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:56.820
it's going to matter because it comes down to what medicines do you give your children?

01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:04.580
We're going to be manufacturing fake journal articles. I'm sure someone's using chat GPT

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:18.980
for this as we speak. If it's not persuasive now to most people, honestly, I'll be amazed if it's

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:26.820
a year before we can actually create journal articles that would take a PhD to debunk

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:34.340
that are completely fake. There are people who are celebrating this kind of

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:41.940
coming cataclysm, but it's just there are the people who

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:47.140
don't have anything to lose who are celebrating it or just are so confused that they just don't

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:52.740
even know what's at stake. Then there are the few people who we could count on a few hands

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:57.380
who have managed to insulate themselves or at least imagine they've insulated themselves from

01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:03.460
the downside here enough that they're not implicated in the great unraveling we are

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:06.900
witnessing or could witness. The shaking up of what is true.

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.740
Actually, that returns us to experts. Do you think experts can save us?

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:16.420
Is there such thing as expertise and experts in something? How do you know if you've achieved it?

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:22.100
I think it's important to acknowledge upfront that there's something paradoxical about

01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:31.300
how we relate to authority, especially within science. I don't think that paradox is going away

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:36.180
and it doesn't have to be confusing. It's not truly a paradox. It's just like there are different

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:47.860
moments in time. It is true to say that within science or within rationality generally,

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:56.020
whenever you're having a fact-based discussion about anything, it is true to say that the truth

01:23:56.020 --> 01:24:04.020
or falsity of a statement does not even slightly depend on the credentials of the person making

01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:10.980
the statement. It doesn't matter if you're a Nobel Laureate, you can be wrong. The last sentence

01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:17.460
you spoke could be total bullshit. It's also possible for someone who's deeply uninformed

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:22.420
to be right about something or to be right for the wrong reasons or someone just gets lucky.

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:30.740
There are middling cases where you have a backyard astronomer who's got no credentials,

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:35.300
but he just loves astronomy and he's got a telescope and he spends a lot of time looking

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:42.020
at the night sky and he discovers a comet that no one else has seen, not even the professional

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:49.300
expert astronomers. I got to think that happens less and less now, but some version of that

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:53.940
keeps happening and it may always keep happening in every area of expertise.

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:06.260
It's true that truth is orthogonal to the reputational concerns we have among apes who

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:16.020
are talking about the truth, but it is also true that most of the time, real experts are much more

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:25.780
reliable than frauds or people who are not experts. Expertise really is a thing. When you're

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:32.020
flying an airplane in a storm, you don't want just randos come into the cockpit saying,

01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:37.540
listen, I've got a new idea about how we should tweak these controls. You want someone who's a

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:42.820
trained pilot and that training gave them something. It gave them a set of competences

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:50.020
and intuitions and they know what all those dials and switches do and I don't. I shouldn't

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:59.540
be flying that plane. When things really matter and putting this at 30,000 feet in a storm

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:10.180
sharpens this up, we want real experts to be in charge. We are at 30,000 feet a lot of the time

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:16.900
on a lot of issues. Whether they're public health issues, whether it's a geopolitical emergency

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:28.980
like Ukraine, climate change, just pick your topic. There are real problems and the clock

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:36.260
is rather often ticking and their solutions are non-obvious. Expertise is a thing and

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:47.940
deferring to experts much of the time makes a lot of sense. At minimum, it prevents spectacular

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:58.580
errors of incompetence and just foolhardiness, but even in the case where you're talking about someone

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:04.420
people like ourselves who are like, we're well-educated. We're not the worst possible

01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:10.180
candidates for the Dunning-Kruger effect. When we're going into a new area where we're not

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:15.940
experts, we're fairly alert to the possibility that it's not as simple as things seem at first

01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:22.580
and we don't know how our tools translate to this new area. We can be fairly circumspect,

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:29.300
but we're also, because we're well-educated and we're pretty quick studies, we can learn a lot

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:35.700
of things pretty fast and we can begin to play a language game that sounds fairly expert.

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:47.220
In that case, the invitation to do your own research is when times are good,

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:54.820
I view as an invitation to waste your time pointlessly when times are good. Now,

01:27:54.820 --> 01:28:02.660
the truth is times are not all that good and we have the ongoing public display of failures

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:08.260
of expertise. We have experts who are obviously corrupted by bad incentives. We've got experts

01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:14.660
who perversely won't admit they were wrong when they in fact are demonstrated to be wrong. We've

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:20.100
got institutions that have been captured by political ideology that's not truth tracking,

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:29.620
this whole woke encroachment into really every place, whether it's universities or science

01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:34.100
journals or government. That has been genuinely deranging.

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:42.580
There's a lot going on where experts and the very concept of expertise has seemed to discredit

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:46.660
itself, but the reality is that there is a massive difference when anything matters,

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:51.140
when there's anything to know about anything, there is a massive difference most of the time

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:57.060
between someone who has really done the work to understand that domain and someone who hasn't.

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:07.780
If I get sick or someone close to me gets sick, I have a PhD in neuroscience, so I can read a

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:15.220
medical journal article and understand a lot of it. I'm just fairly conversant with medical

01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:22.020
terminology and I understand its methods. I'm alert to the difference because in neuroscience,

01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:29.220
I've spent hours and hours in journal clubs analyzing the difference between good and bad

01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:35.380
studies. I'm alert to the difference between good and bad studies in medical journals. I understand

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:42.260
that bad studies can get published and experiments can be poorly designed.

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:46.740
I'm alert to all of those things, but when I get sick or when someone close to me gets sick,

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:53.540
I don't pretend to be a doctor. I've got no clinical experience. I don't go down the rabbit

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:59.460
hole on Google for days at a stretch trying to become a doctor, much less a specialist in

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:05.220
the domain of problem that has been visited upon me or my family. If someone close to me

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:13.300
gets cancer, I don't pretend to be an oncologist. I don't start reading in journals of oncology

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:26.820
and try to really get up to speed as an oncologist. One is a bad and very likely misleading

01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:39.140
use of my time. If I had a lot of runway, if I decided, okay, it's really important for me

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:44.100
to know everything I can. At this point, I know someone's going to get cancer. I may not go back

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:48.340
to school and become an oncologist, but what I want to do is I want to know everything I can

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:54.580
know about cancer. I'm going to take the next four years and spend most of my time on cancer. Okay,

01:30:54.580 --> 01:31:01.140
I could do that. I still think that's a waste of my time. I still think at the end of even

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:05.940
at the end of those four years, I'm not going to be the best person to form intuitions about

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:12.900
what to do in the face of the next cancer that I have to confront. I'm still going to want a

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:18.900
better oncologist than I've become to tell me what he or she would do if they were in my shoes or in

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:30.340
the shoes of my family member. I'm not advocating a blind trust and authority. If you get cancer

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:34.980
and you're talking to one oncologist and they're recommending some course of treatment, by all

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:40.980
means get a second opinion, get a third opinion. But it matters that those opinions are coming

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:49.860
from real experts and not from Robert Kennedy Jr. who's telling you that you got it because

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:57.140
you got a vaccine. We're swimming in a sea of misinformation where you've got people

01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:06.820
who are moving the opinions of millions of others who should not have an opinion on these topics.

01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:14.100
There is no scenario in which you should be getting your opinion about vaccine safety

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:21.620
or climate change or the war in Ukraine or anything else that we might want to talk about from

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:30.580
Candace Owens. She's not a relevant expert on any of those topics and what's more,

01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:38.980
she doesn't seem to care. She's living in a culture that has amplified that not caring

01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:45.620
into an effective business model. There's something very Trumpian about all that.

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:54.260
The problem is the culture, it's not these specific individuals. The paradox here is that

01:32:54.340 --> 01:33:03.860
expertise is a real thing and we defer to it a lot as a labor-saving device and just based on

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:10.740
the reality that it's very hard to be a polymath and specialization is a thing.

01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:14.900
There are people who specialize in a very narrow topic. They know more about that topic than the

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:21.460
next guy, no matter how smart that guy or gal is, and those differences matter. But it's also true

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:31.620
that when you're talking about facts, sometimes the best experts are wrong. The scientific consensus

01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:38.660
is wrong. You get a sea change in the thinking of a whole field because one person who's an outlier

01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:44.500
for whatever reason decides, okay, I'm going to prove this point, and they prove it.

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:52.180
So somebody like the doctor who believed that stomach ulcers were not due to stress but were

01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:59.860
due to H. pylori infections, so he just drank a vial of H. pylori bacteria and quickly got an

01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:05.700
ulcer and convinced the field that at minimum H. pylori infections were not due to stress.

01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:12.660
Convinced the field that at minimum H. pylori was involved in that process. Okay, so yes,

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:20.340
everyone was wrong. That doesn't disprove the reality of expertise. It doesn't disprove the

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:25.860
utility of relying on experts most of the time, especially in an emergency, especially when the

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:32.500
clock is ticking, especially when you're in this particular cockpit and you only have one chance

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:38.020
to land this plane, right? You want the real pilot at the controls.

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.780
But there's just a few things to say.

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:45.380
So one, you mentioned this example with cancer and doing your own research.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:51.380
There are several things that are different about our particular time in history. One,

01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:58.180
doing your own research has become more and more effective because you can read, the internet made

01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:03.300
information a lot more accessible. So you can read a lot of different meta-analyses.

01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:09.380
You can read blog posts that describe to you exactly the flaws in the different papers that

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:15.220
make up the meta-analyses. And you can read a lot of those blog posts that are conflicting with

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:20.100
each other and you can take that information in and in a short amount of time, you can start to make

01:35:22.660 --> 01:35:27.060
good faith interpretations. For example, I don't know, I don't want to overstate things, but

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:34.900
if you suffer from depression, for example, then you could go to an expert and a doctor that

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:40.180
prescribes you some medication, but you could also challenge some of those ideas and seeing like,

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:43.220
what are the different medications, what are the different side effects, what are the different

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:48.100
solutions to depression, all that kind of stuff. And I think depression is just a really difficult

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:55.140
problem. That's very, I don't want to, again, state incorrect things, but I think there's a

01:35:55.140 --> 01:36:01.060
lot of variability of what depression really means. So being introspective about the type

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:05.700
of depression you have and the different possible solutions you have, just doing your own research

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:12.020
as a first step before approaching a doctor or as you have multiple opinions could be very beneficial

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:16.420
in that case. Now that's depression, that's something that's been studied for a very long

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:25.220
time with a new pandemic that's affecting everybody. It's with the airplane equated to

01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:33.540
like 9-11 or something, like a new emergency just happened and everybody, every expert in the world

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:38.740
is publishing on it and talking about it. So doing your own research there could be

01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:45.300
exceptionally effective in asking questions. And then there's a difference between experts,

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:50.900
virologists, and it's actually a good question, who is exactly the expert in a pandemic?

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:58.500
There's the actual experts doing the research and publishing stuff, and then there's the

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:05.540
communicators of that expertise. And the question is, if the communicators are flawed,

01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:12.500
to a degree where doing your own research is actually the more effective way to figure out

01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:16.820
policies and solutions. Because you're not competing with the experts, you're competing

01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:21.940
with the communicators of expertise. That could be WHO, CDC in the case of the pandemic, or

01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:28.100
politicians, or political type of science figures like Anthony Fauci. There's a question there

01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:39.380
of the effectiveness of doing your own research in that context. And the competing forces there,

01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:44.020
incentives that you've mentioned, is you can become quite popular by being contrarian,

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:47.860
by saying everybody's lying to you, all the authorities are lying to you, all the institutions

01:37:47.860 --> 01:37:53.940
are lying to you. So those are the waters you're swimming in. But I think doing your own research

01:37:53.940 --> 01:38:01.140
in that kind of context could be quite effective. Let me be clear. I'm not saying you shouldn't do

01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:04.980
any research. I'm not saying that you shouldn't be informed about an issue. I'm not saying you

01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:11.060
shouldn't read articles on whatever the topic is. And yes, if I got cancer or someone close to me

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:16.500
got cancer, I probably would read more about cancer than I've read thus far about cancer.

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:26.740
And I've read some. So I'm not making a virtue of ignorance and a blind obedience to authority.

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:31.380
And again, I recognize that authorities can discredit themselves or they can be wrong.

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:38.340
They can be wrong even when there's no discredit. There's a lot we don't understand about the nature

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:49.860
of the world. But still this vast gulf between truly informed opinion and bullshit exists.

01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:59.700
It always exists. And conspiracy thinking is rather often, most of the time,

01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:05.780
a species of bullshit. But it's not always wrong. There are real conspiracies. And there really are

01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:17.540
just awful corruptions born of bad incentives within our scientific processes, within institutions.

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:24.740
And again, we've mentioned a lot of these things in passing. But what woke political ideology did

01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:30.740
to scientific communication during the pandemic was awful. And it was really corrosive of public

01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:37.620
trust, especially on the right, for understandable reasons. It was crazy, some of the things that

01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:43.540
were being said, and still is. And these cases are all different. You take depression. We just

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:50.100
don't know enough about depression for anyone to be that confident about anything. And there are

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:56.180
many different modalities in which to interact with it as a problem. So there's pharmaceuticals

01:39:56.180 --> 01:40:00.500
have whatever promise they have, but there's certainly reason to be concerned that they don't

01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:08.420
work well for everybody. And it's obvious they don't work well for everybody, but they do work

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:18.260
for some people. But again, depression is a multifactorial problem. And there are different

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:22.900
levels at which to influence it. And there are things like meditation. There are things like

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:30.180
just life changes. And one of the first things about depression is that when you're depressed,

01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:34.180
all of the things that would be good for you to do are precisely the things you don't want to do.

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:38.260
You don't have any energy to socialize. You don't want to get things done. You don't want to exercise.

01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:44.100
And all of those things, if you've got those up and running, they do make you feel better

01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:51.780
in the aggregate. But the reality is that there are clinical level depressions that are so bad

01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:58.980
that we just don't have good tools for them. And there's no life change someone's going to

01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:09.140
embrace that is going to be an obvious remedy for that. Pandemics are obviously a complicated

01:41:09.140 --> 01:41:16.740
problem, but I would consider it much simpler than depression in terms of what's on the menu

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:21.700
to be chosen among the various choices. It's less multifactorial.

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:26.180
The logic by which you would make those choices. Yeah. So it's like we have a virus. We have a new

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:33.460
virus. It's some version of bad. It's human transmissible. We're still catching up. We're

01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:36.100
catching up to every aspect of it. We don't know how it spreads.

01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:39.780
We don't know how effective masks are. Well, at a certain point, we knew it was

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:46.820
respiratory and whether it's spread by fomites. We were confused about a lot of things

01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:50.500
and we're still confused. It's been a moving target this whole time and it's been changing

01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:59.380
this whole time. And our responses to it have been we ramped up the vaccines as quickly as we could,

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:04.980
but too quick for some, not quick enough for others. We could have done human challenge

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:10.660
trials and got them out more quickly with better data. And I think that's something we should

01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:16.180
probably look at in the future because to my eye, that would make ethical sense to do challenge

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:24.740
trials. And so much of my concern about COVID, I mean, many people are confused about my concern

01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:31.860
about COVID. My concern about COVID has for much of the time not been narrowly focused on COVID

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:40.340
itself, how dangerous I perceive COVID to be as a illness. It has been for the longest time

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:48.340
even more a concern about our ability to respond to a truly scary pathogen next time.

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:58.580
Outside those initial months, give me the first six months to be quite worried about

01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:02.660
COVID and the unraveling of society. And the supply of toilet paper.

01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:07.620
You want to secure a steady supply of toilet paper. But beyond that initial period,

01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:12.900
when we had a sense of what we were dealing with and we had every hope that the vaccines

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:16.420
are actually going to work and we knew we were getting those vaccines in short order,

01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:23.140
and we knew just how dangerous the illness was and how dangerous it wasn't.

01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:30.500
And for years now, I've just been worrying about this as a failed dress rehearsal for

01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:35.540
something much worse. I think what we prove to ourselves at this moment in history is that

01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:39.700
we have built informational tools that we do not know how to use.

01:43:41.140 --> 01:43:47.140
And we have made ourselves, we've basically enrolled all of human society into a psychological

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:56.660
experiment that is deranging us and making it virtually impossible to solve coordination

01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:00.340
problems that we absolutely have to solve next time when things are worse.

01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:08.980
Do you understand who is at fault for the way this unraveled? The way we didn't seem to have

01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:16.020
the distrust in institutions and the institution of science that grew seemingly exponentially

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:22.340
or got revealed through this process. Who is at fault here and what's to fix?

01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:29.860
So much blame to go around, but so much of it is not a matter of bad people conspiring to do bad

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:38.980
things. It's a matter of incompetence and misaligned incentives and just ordinary,

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:44.420
plain vanilla dysfunction. But my problem was that people like you,

01:44:45.060 --> 01:44:50.900
people like Bret Weinstein, people that I look to for reasonable, difficult conversations on

01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:56.820
difficult topics have a little bit lost their mind, became emotional and dogmatic in style

01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:04.100
of conversation, perhaps not in the depth of actual ideas. But I tweet something of that nature,

01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:11.780
not about you, but just it feels like the pandemic made people really more emotional than before.

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:17.700
And then Kimbo Musk responded, something I think you probably would agree with. Maybe not.

01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:23.060
I think it was the combo of Trump and the pandemic. Trump triggered the far left to be way more active

01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:27.300
than they could have been without him. And then the pandemic handed big government,

01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.940
nanny state, lefties a huge platform on a silver platter, a one-two punch, and here we are.

01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:36.180
I would agree with some of that. I'm not sure how much to read into the nanny state

01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:43.300
concept, but- But yet basically got people on the far left really activated

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:49.060
and then gave control to, I don't know if you say nanny state, but just control to government

01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:55.460
that when executed poorly has created a complete distrust in government.

01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:00.580
My fear is that there was going to be that complete distrust anyway, given the nature of

01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:05.540
the information space, given the level of conspiracy thinking, given the gaming of

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:16.500
these tools by an anti-vax cult. There really is an anti-vax cult that just ramped up its energy

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:19.860
during this moment. But it's a small one.

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:26.980
It's not to say that every concern about vaccines is a species of, it was born of misinformation or

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:34.420
born of this cult, but there is a cult that is just, and the core of Trumpism is a cult.

01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:40.340
I mean, QAnon is a cult. And so there's a lot of lying and there's a lot of confusion.

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:50.180
It's almost impossible to exaggerate how confused some people are and how fully their

01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:54.500
lives are organized around that confusion. I mean, there are people who think that

01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:59.620
the world's being run by pedophile cannibals and that Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey and

01:46:59.620 --> 01:47:05.620
Michelle Obama are among those cannibals. I mean, adjacent to the pure crazy,

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:10.740
there's the semi-crazy, and adjacent to the semi-crazy, there's the grifting opportunist

01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:22.980
asshole. And the layers of bad faith are hard to fully diagnose. But the problem is,

01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:29.780
all of this is getting signal-boosted by an outrage machine that is preferentially spreading

01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:35.780
misinformation. It has a business model that is guaranteed that is preferentially sharing

01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:41.620
misinformation. Actually, just on a small tangent, how do you defend yourself against the claim that

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:44.980
you're a pedophile cannibal? It's difficult.

01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:49.940
Here's the case I would make, because I don't think you can use reason. I think you have to use

01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:52.660
empathy. You have to understand.

01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:57.300
But part of it, I mean, I find it very difficult to believe that anyone

01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:03.780
believes these things. I'm sure there's some number of people who are just pretending to

01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:09.140
believe these things, because it's just, again, this is sort of like the 4chanification of

01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:15.460
everything. It's just Pepe the Frog. None of this is what it seems. They're not signaling

01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:21.940
an alliance with white supremacy or neo-Nazism, but they're not doing it. They just don't fucking

01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:30.180
care. It's just cynicism overflowing its banks. It's just fun to wind up the normies. Look at all

01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:33.940
the normies who don't understand that a green frog is just a green frog, even when it isn't

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:41.860
just a green frog. It's just gumming up everyone's cognitive bandwidth with bullshit. I get that

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:49.300
that's fun if you're a teenager and you just want to vandalize our new sphere, but at a certain

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:58.740
point, we have to recognize that real questions of human welfare are in play. There are wars

01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:04.100
getting fought or not fought, and there's a pandemic raging, and there's medicine to take

01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:11.620
or not take. But to come back to this issue of COVID, I don't think I got so out of balance

01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:18.900
around COVID. I think people are quite confused about what I was concerned about. Yes, there was

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:24.180
a period where I was crazy because anyone who was taking it seriously was crazy because they had no

01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:30.580
idea what was going on. Yes, I was wiping down packages with alcohol wipes because

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:38.420
people thought it was transmissible by touch. When we realized that was no longer the case,

01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:45.300
I stopped doing that. Again, it was a moving target, and a lot of things we did in hindsight

01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:53.140
around masking and school closures looked fairly dysfunctional and unnecessary.

01:49:53.140 --> 01:50:00.260
I think the criticism that people would say about you talking about COVID, and maybe you can correct

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:10.660
me, but you were against skepticism of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. People who

01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:19.700
get nervous about the vaccine but don't fall into the usual anti-vax camp, which I think there was

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:28.340
a significant enough number, they're getting nervous. Especially after the war in Afghanistan

01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:33.940
and Iraq, I too was nervous about anything where a lot of money could be made.

01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:40.980
You just see how the people who are greedy, they come to the surface all of a sudden.

01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:46.180
A lot of them that run institutions are actually really good human beings. I know a lot of them,

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:51.220
but it's hard to know how those two combine together when there's hundreds of billions,

01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:59.620
trillions of dollars to be made. The sense was that you weren't open enough to the skepticism.

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:03.860
I understand that people have that sense. I'll tell you how I thought about it and think about it.

01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:08.580
One, again, it was a moving target. There was a point in the timeline where

01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:20.340
it was totally rational to expect that the vaccines were both working, both they were

01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:28.980
reasonably safe and that COVID was reasonably dangerous. The trade-off for basically everyone

01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:34.260
was it was rational to get vaccinated. Given the level of testing and how many people had been

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:40.820
vaccinated before you, given what we were seeing with COVID, that was a forced choice.

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:43.700
You're eventually going to get COVID and the question is, do you want to be vaccinated when

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:50.500
you do? There was a period where that forced choice was just obviously reasonable to get

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:57.620
vaccinated, especially because there was every reason to expect that while it wasn't a perfectly

01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:04.100
sterilizing vaccine, it was going to knock down transmission a lot and that matters. It wasn't

01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:10.340
just a personal choice. You were actually being a good citizen when you decided to run whatever

01:52:10.340 --> 01:52:16.420
risk you were going to run to get vaccinated because there are people in our society who

01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:20.740
actually can't get vaccinated. I know people who can't take any vaccines. They're so allergic.

01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:28.180
They, in their own person, seem to justify all of the fears of the anti-vax cult. They're the kind

01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:33.380
of person who Robert Kennedy Jr. can point to and say, see, vaccines will fucking kill you.

01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:39.860
Because of the experience and we're still, I know people who have kids who fit that description.

01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:49.380
We should all feel a civic responsibility to be vaccinated against egregiously awful and

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:55.700
transmissible diseases for which we have relatively safe vaccines to keep those

01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:59.300
sorts of people safe. There was a period of time when it was thought that the vaccine could stop

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:06.900
transmission. Yes. Again, all of this has begun to shift. I don't think it has shifted as much as

01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:13.620
Brett Weinstein thinks it's shifted, but yes, there are safety concerns around the mRNA vaccines,

01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:22.980
especially for young men. As far as I know, that's the purview of actual heightened concern.

01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:32.100
But also, there's now a lot of natural immunity out there. Basically, everyone who was going to

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:38.340
get vaccinated has gotten vaccinated. The virus has evolved to the point in this context where

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:49.300
it seems less dangerous. Again, I'm going more on the seemings than on research that I've done

01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:53.140
at this point, but I'm certainly less worried about getting COVID. I've had it once,

01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:58.740
I've been vaccinated. You ask me now, how do I feel about getting the next booster?

01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:05.380
I don't know that I'm going to get the next booster. I was somebody who was waiting in line

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:12.020
at four in the morning hoping to get some overflow vaccine when it was first available.

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:19.620
And at that point, given what we knew or given what I thought I knew based on the best sources

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:27.780
I could consult and based on anecdotes that were too vivid to ignore, both data and personal

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:34.500
experience, it was totally rational for me to want to get that vaccine as soon as I could.

01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:41.620
And now, I think it's totally rational for me to do a different kind of cost benefit analysis and

01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:48.740
wonder, listen, do I really need to get a booster? How many of these boosters am I going to get for

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:56.580
the rest of my life, really? And how safe is the mRNA vaccine for a man of my age? And do I need

01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:03.700
to be worried about myocarditis? All of that is completely rational to talk about now. My concern

01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:12.820
is that at every point along the way, I was the wrong person and Brett Weinstein was the wrong

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:18.100
person and there's many other people I could add to this list to have strong opinions about any of

01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:25.860
this stuff. I just disagree with that. I think, yes, in theory, I agree 100%, but I feel like experts

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:28.660
failed at communicating, not at doing- They did.

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:34.900
And I just feel like you and Brett Weinstein actually have the tools with the internet,

01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:41.460
given the engine you have in your brain of thinking for months at a time, deeply about the

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:46.980
problems that face our world, that you actually have the tools to do pretty good thinking here.

01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:53.060
But there would be deference to experts and pseudo-experts behind all of that.

01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:56.180
Well, the papers, you would stand on the shoulders of giants, but you can serve those

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:59.380
shoulders better than the giants themselves. Yeah, but I knew we were going to disagree

01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:06.340
about that. I saw his podcast where he brought on these experts who, many of them, had the right

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:13.620
credentials, but for a variety of reasons, they didn't pass the smell test for me. One larger

01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:19.700
problem, and this goes back to the problem of how we rely on authority in science, is that you can

01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:27.780
always find a PhD or an MD to champion any crackpot idea. It is amazing, but you could

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:33.620
find PhDs and MDs who would sit up there in front of Congress and say that they thought

01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:39.380
smoking was not addictive, or that it was not harmful. There was no direct link between

01:56:39.380 --> 01:56:42.260
smoking and lung cancer. You could always find those people.

01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:49.380
And some of the people Brett found were people who had obvious tells, to my point of view,

01:56:50.660 --> 01:57:01.060
to my eye. Some of the same people were on Rogan's podcast. And it's hard because if a person

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:06.980
does have the right credentials and they're not saying something floridly mistaken,

01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:14.100
and we're talking about something where there are genuine unknowns, like how much do we know

01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:19.460
about the safety of these vaccines? At that point, not a whole hell of a lot. We have no

01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:26.100
long-term data on mRNA vaccines. But to confidently say that millions of people are going to die

01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:32.420
because of these vaccines, and to confidently say that ivermectin is a panacea, ivermectin is the

01:57:32.420 --> 01:57:37.460
thing that prevents COVID. There was no good reason to say either of those things at that

01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:46.100
moment. Given that that's where Brett was, I felt like there was nothing to debate. We're both the

01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:50.500
wrong people to be getting into the weeds on this. We're both going to defer to our

01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:59.780
chosen experts. His experts look like crackpots to me, or at least the ones who are most vociferous

01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:06.500
on those edgiest points. And your experts seem like, what is the term, mass hysteria? I forgot the

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:15.780
term. No, but it's like with climate science. It's received as a canard in half our society now, but

01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:21.860
the claim that 97% of climate scientists agree that human-caused climate change is a thing.

01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:28.340
Do you go with the 97% most of the time, or do you go with the 3% most of the time?

01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:34.660
It's obvious you go with the 97% most of the time for anything that matters. It's not to say that

01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:42.180
the 3% are always wrong. Again, things get overturned. And yes, as you say, I've spent

01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:45.300
much more time worrying about this on my podcast than I've spent worrying about COVID.

01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:56.020
Our institutions have lost trust for good reason. It's an open question whether

01:58:56.020 --> 01:59:05.700
we can actually get things done with this level of transparency and pseudo transparency given our

01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:11.620
information ecosystems. Can we fight a war, really fight a war that we may have to fight,

01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:18.260
like the next Nazis? Can we fight that war when everyone with an iPhone is showing just how awful

01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:25.060
it is that little girls get blown up when we drop our bombs? Could we, as a society,

01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:33.140
do what we might have to do to actually get necessary things done when we're living in this

01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:38.900
panopticon of just everyone's a journalist, right? Everyone's a scientist. Everyone's an expert.

01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:45.940
Everyone's got direct contact with the facts or semblance of the facts. I don't know.

01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:50.260
I think yes. And I think voices like yours are exceptionally important. And I think there's

01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:56.020
certain signals you send in your ability to steal me on the other side in your empathy,

01:59:56.020 --> 02:00:02.100
essentially. So that's the fight. That's the mechanism by which you resist

02:00:05.380 --> 02:00:12.500
the dogmatism of this binary thinking. And then if you become a trusted person that's able to

02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:18.260
consider the other side, then people will listen to you as the aggregator, as the communicator of

02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:23.700
expertise. Because the virologists haven't been able to be good communicators. I still to this day

02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:33.460
don't really know what am I supposed to think about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines

02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:37.460
today? As it stands today, what are we supposed to think? What are we supposed to think about

02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:43.300
testing? What are we supposed to think about the effectiveness of masks or lockdowns? Where's the

02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:49.700
great communicators on this topic that consider all the other conspiracy theories, all the

02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:54.740
communication that's out there and actually aggregating it together and being able to

02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:59.860
say this is actually what's most likely the truth. And also some of that has to do with

02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:04.900
humility, epistemic humility, knowing that you can't really know for sure.

02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:11.540
Just like with depression, you can't really know for sure. I'm not seeing those communications

02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:17.140
being effectively done even still today. Well, the jury is still out on some of it.

02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:22.900
And again, it's a moving target. It's complicated. Some of it's a self-fulfilling

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:34.900
dynamic. In theory, a lockdown would work if we could only do it, but we can't really do it.

02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:38.100
And there's a lot of people who won't do it because they're convinced that this is the

02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:44.500
totalitarian boot finally on the neck of the good people who

02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:50.740
are always having their interests traduced by the elites.

02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:57.620
If you have enough people who think the lockdown for any reason in the face of any conceivable

02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:04.820
illness is just code for the new world order coming to fuck you over and take your guns.

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:11.460
Okay, you have a society that is now immune to reason because there are absolutely certain

02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:20.340
pathogens that we should lock down for next time. And it was completely rational in the beginning

02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:28.100
of this thing to attempt a lockdown. We never really locked down. To attempt some semblance

02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:34.100
of a lockdown just to, quote, bend the curve, to spare our healthcare system, given what we were

02:02:34.100 --> 02:02:39.780
seeing happening in Italy. That moment was not hard to navigate, at least in my view.

02:02:39.780 --> 02:02:45.460
It was obvious at the time. In retrospect, my views on that haven't changed, except for the

02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:53.620
fact that I recognize maybe it's just impossible, given the nature of people's response to that

02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:57.940
demand. We live in a society that's just not going to lock down.

02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:00.260
Unless the pandemic is much more deadly.

02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:05.380
Right. So that's a point I made, which was maliciously clipped out from some other podcast

02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:10.100
where someone's trying to make it look like I want to see children die. There's a pity more

02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:16.980
children didn't die from COVID. This is actually the same person who... And that's the other thing

02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:24.180
that got so poisoned here. It's like that person, this psychopath or effective psychopath who's

02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:27.380
creating these clips of me on podcasts. The second clip of me

02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:36.100
seeming to say that I wish more children died during COVID, but it was so clear in context what

02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:39.220
I was saying that even the clip betrayed the context, so it didn't actually work.

02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:44.500
This psycho, and again, I don't know whether he actually is a psychopath, but he's behaving like

02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:51.460
one because of the incentives of Twitter. This is somebody who Brett signal boosted as a very

02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:58.020
reliable source of information. He kept retweeting this guy at me, against me.

02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:08.180
At one glance, I knew how unreliable this guy was, but I think I'm not at all... One thing I

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:14.420
think I did wrong, one thing that I do regret, one thing I have not sorted out for myself is

02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:22.980
how to navigate the professional and personal pressure that gets

02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:30.180
applied at this moment where you have a friend or an acquaintance or someone you know

02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:38.820
who's behaving badly in public or behaving in a way that you think is bad in public.

02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:43.860
They have a public platform where they're influencing a lot of people

02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:48.260
and you have your own public platform where you're constantly getting asked to comment

02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:52.340
on what this friend or acquaintance or colleague is doing.

02:04:54.340 --> 02:05:01.060
I haven't known what I think is ethically right about the choices that seem forced

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:06.580
on us at moments like this. I've criticized you in public about your interview with Kanye.

02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:12.740
In that case, I reached out to you in private first and told you exactly what I thought,

02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:16.580
and then when I was going to get asked in public or when I was touching that topic on my

02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:20.580
podcast, I more or less said the same thing that I said to you in private.

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:29.220
That was how I navigated that moment. I did the same thing with Elon, at least at the beginning.

02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:39.220
We have maintained good vibes, which is not what I can say about Elon.

02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:45.540
But I disagree with you because good vibes in the moment, there's a deep core of good

02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:50.340
vibes that persist through time between you and Elon, and I would argue probably between

02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:55.540
some of the other folks you mentioned. I think with Brett, I failed to reach out in private

02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:04.740
to the degree that I should have. We had tried to set up a conversation in private that never

02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:12.100
happened. There was some communication, but it would have been much better for me to have made

02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:17.540
more of an effort in private than I did before it spilled out into public. I would say that's true

02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:21.380
with other people as well. What kind of interaction in private

02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:26.340
do you think you should have with Brett? Because my case would be beforehand and now still.

02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:34.260
The case I would like in this part of the criticism you sent my way, maybe it's useful

02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:39.300
to go to that direction. Actually, let's go to that direction because I think I disagree

02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:44.100
with your criticism as you stated publicly. You're talking about your review of Kanye.

02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:49.460
The thing you criticized me for is actually the right thing to do with Brett. You said Lex could

02:06:49.460 --> 02:06:55.380
have spoken with Kanye in such a way as to have produced a useful document. He didn't do that

02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:58.740
because he has a fairly naive philosophy about the power of love.

02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:03.380
Let's see if you can maintain that philosophy in the present.

02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:10.740
Let's go. No, it's beautiful. He seemed to think that if he just got through the minefield

02:07:10.740 --> 02:07:16.100
to the end of the conversation where the two of them still were feeling good about one another

02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:19.700
and they can hug it out, that would be by definition a success.

02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:27.140
So let me make the case for this power of love philosophy. First of all, I love you Sam,

02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:35.300
you're still an inspiration and somebody I deeply admire. To me, in the case of Kanye,

02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:43.220
it's not only that you get through the conversation and have hugs, it's that the

02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:48.580
display that you're willing to do that has power. So even if it doesn't end in hugging,

02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:57.940
the act of turning the other cheek itself communicates both to Kanye later and to the

02:07:57.940 --> 02:08:04.980
rest of the world that we should have empathy and compassion towards each other. There is power to

02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:10.980
that. Maybe that is naive, but I believe in the power of that. So it's not that I'm trying to

02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:17.300
convince Kanye that some of his ideas are wrong, but I'm trying to illustrate that just the act of

02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:26.020
listening and truly trying to understand the human being, that opens people's minds to actually

02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:30.580
questioning their own beliefs more. It takes them out of the dogmatism, deescalates the kind of

02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:36.580
dogmatism that I've been seeing. So in that sense, I would say the power of love

02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:43.700
is the philosophy you might apply to Brett because the right conversation you have in private

02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:50.980
is not about, hey, listen, the experts you're talking to, they seem credentialed, but they're

02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:55.380
not actually as credentialed as they are illustrating. They're not grounding their

02:08:55.380 --> 02:09:00.660
findings in actual meta-analyses in the papers and so on, making a strong case. What are you doing?

02:09:00.660 --> 02:09:05.460
This is going to get a lot of people in trouble. But instead just saying, being a friend in the

02:09:05.460 --> 02:09:14.500
dumbest of ways, being respectful, sending love their way, and just having a conversation outside

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:25.860
of all of this. Basically showing that removing the emotional attachment to this debate, even

02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:30.820
though you are very emotionally attached because in the case of COVID specifically, there is a very

02:09:30.820 --> 02:09:36.820
large number of lives at stake, but removing all of that and remembering that you have a friendship.

02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:43.060
Yeah. Well, so I think these are highly non-analogous cases, right? So your conversation

02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:51.460
with Kanye misfired from my point of view for a very different reason. It has to do with Kanye.

02:09:51.940 --> 02:10:02.900
Kanye, I've never met Kanye, so obviously I don't know him, but I think he's either obviously in the

02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:09.860
midst of a mental health crisis or he's a colossal asshole or both. I mean, actually those aren't

02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:15.300
mutually exclusive. So one of three possibilities, he's either mentally ill, he's an asshole,

02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:19.860
or he's mentally ill and an asshole. I think all three of those possibilities are possible

02:10:19.860 --> 02:10:25.700
for the both of us as well. No, I would argue none of those are likely for either of us, but

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:33.940
not to say we don't have our moments. So the reason not to talk to Kanye, I think you should

02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:40.100
have had the conversation you had with him in private. That's great. I've got no criticism

02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:48.100
of what you said had it been in private. I just thought you're not doing him a favor. If he's

02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:56.340
mentally ill, he's in the middle of a manic episode or I'm not a clinician, but I've heard

02:10:56.340 --> 02:11:03.060
it said of him that he is bipolar, you're not doing him a favor sticking a mic in front of him

02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:10.260
and letting him go off on the Jews or anything else. We know what he thought about the Jews.

02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:15.060
We know that there's not much illumination that's going to come from him on that topic.

02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:21.300
And if it is a symptom of his mental illness that he thinks these things, well then you're

02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:27.460
not doing him a favor making that even more public. If he's just an asshole and he's just

02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:34.100
an anti-Semite, an ordinary garden variety anti-Semite, well then there's also not much to

02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:40.580
say unless you're really going to dig in and kick the shit out of him in public. And I'm saying you

02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:46.420
can do that with love. That's the other thing here is that I don't agree that compassion and

02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:57.780
love always have this patient, embracing, acquiescent face. They don't always feel good

02:11:57.780 --> 02:12:04.500
to the recipient. There is a sword of wisdom that you can wield compassionately in moments

02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:09.060
like that where someone's full of shit and you just make it absolutely clear to them and to your

02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:14.340
audience that they're full of shit. And there's no hatred being communicated. In fact, you could

02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:19.860
just say, listen, I'm going to do everyone a favor right now and just take your foot out of your

02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:27.220
mouth. And the truth is, I just wouldn't have aired the conversation. I just don't think it

02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:33.860
was a document that had to get out there. This is not a signal you're likely to get from your

02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:38.260
audience. I get that many people in your audience thought, oh my God, that's awesome. You're talking

02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:42.900
to Kanye and you're doing it in Lex style where it's just love and you're not treating him like

02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:49.060
a pariah and you're holding this tension between he's this creative genius whose work we love

02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:55.220
and yet he's having this moment that's so painful and what a tightrope walk. And I get that maybe

02:12:55.220 --> 02:13:02.020
90% of your audience saw it that way. They're still wrong. And I still think that was on balance,

02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:05.300
not a good thing to put out into the world. You don't think it opens up the mind and heart

02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:10.820
of people that listen to that, just seeing a person. If it does, it's opening up in the wrong

02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:18.260
direction where just gale force nonsense is coming in. I think we should have an open mind

02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:24.100
and an open heart, but there's some clear things here that we have to keep in view.

02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:28.660
One is the mental illness component is its own thing. I don't pretend to understand what's going

02:13:28.660 --> 02:13:34.980
on with him. But insofar as that's the reason he's saying what he's saying, do not put this guy on

02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:39.700
camera and let no one see. Sorry, in that point, real quick, I had a bunch of conversation with

02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:46.900
him offline and I didn't get a sense of mental illness. That's why I chose to sit down. Mental

02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:54.580
illness is such a... But when he shows up in a gimp hood on Alex Jones' podcast, either that's

02:13:55.300 --> 02:14:01.860
more genius performance in his world or he's unraveling further. I wouldn't put that under

02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:09.140
mental illness. I think there's another conversation to be had about how we treat artists

02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:21.860
because they're weirdos. Taking words from Kanye as if he's like Christopher Hitchens

02:14:21.860 --> 02:14:30.740
or something like that, very eloquent, researched, written many books on history, on politics,

02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:36.660
on geopolitics, on psychology. Kanye didn't do any of that. He's an artist just spouting off.

02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:42.900
And so there's a different style of conversation and a different way to treat the words that are

02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:46.020
coming out of his mouth. Let's leave the mental illness aside. So if we're going to say that

02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:50.180
there's no reason to think he's mentally ill and this is just him being creative and brilliant and

02:14:50.180 --> 02:14:56.180
opinionated, well, then that falls into the asshole bucket for me. It's like then he's someone... And

02:14:56.180 --> 02:15:00.500
honestly, the most offensive thing about him in that interview from my point of view is not the

02:15:00.500 --> 02:15:05.460
anti-Semitism, which we can talk about because I think there are problems just letting him

02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:14.820
spread those memes as well. But the most offensive thing is just how delusionally egocentric he is

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:22.580
or was coming off in that interview and in others. He has an estimation of himself as this omnibus

02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:30.420
genius not only to rival Shakespeare, to exceed Shakespeare. He is the greatest mind that has

02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:35.380
ever walked among us. And he's more or less explicit on that point. And yet he manages to

02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:41.460
talk for hours without saying anything actually interesting or insightful or factually illuminating.

02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:48.500
So it's complete delusion of a very Trumpian sort. It's like when Trump says he's a genius

02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:53.060
who understands everything, but nobody takes him seriously. One wonders whether Trump takes

02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:59.140
himself seriously. Kanye seems to believe his own press. He actually thinks he's

02:16:00.660 --> 02:16:11.300
just a colossus. And he may be a great musician. It's certainly not my wheelhouse to compare him

02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:19.220
to any other musicians, but one thing that's patently obvious from your conversation is he's

02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:26.100
not who he thinks he is intellectually or ethically or in any other relevant way. And so when you

02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:33.700
couple that to the antisemitism he was spreading, which was genuinely noxious and ill-considered and

02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:40.980
has potential knock-on effects in the black community. There's an ambient level of

02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:45.700
antisemitism in the black community that is worth worrying about and talking about anyway.

02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:50.180
There's a bunch of guys playing the knockout game in Brooklyn just punching Orthodox Jews in the

02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:57.220
face. And I think letting Kanye air his antisemitism that publicly only raises

02:16:58.100 --> 02:17:00.020
the likelihood of that rather than diminishes it.

02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:04.420
I don't know. So let me say just a couple of things. So one, my belief at the time

02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:10.100
was it doesn't, it decreases it. Showing empathy while pushing back decreases the likelihood of

02:17:10.100 --> 02:17:16.340
that. It might on the surface look like it's increasing it, but that's simply because the

02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:22.100
antisemitism or the hatred in general is brought to the surface and that people talk about it.

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:27.060
But I should also say that you're one of the only people that wrote to me privately criticizing me

02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:33.620
and like out of the people I really respect and admire and that was really valuable that I had to

02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:39.460
painful because I had to think through it for a while. It still haunts me because

02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:46.900
the other kind of criticism I got a lot of people basically said things towards me

02:17:49.220 --> 02:17:50.820
based on who I am that they hate me.

02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:52.580
You mean antisemitic things?

02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:57.380
Yeah, antisemitic things. I just hate the word antisemitic. It's like racist.

02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:04.100
But here's the reality. So I'm someone, so I'm Jewish, although obviously not religious.

02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:12.660
I have never taken, I've been a student of the Holocaust obviously. I know a lot about that and

02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:20.980
there's reason to be a student of the Holocaust. But in my lifetime and in my experience, I have

02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:28.020
never taken antisemitism very seriously. I have not worried about it. I have not made a thing of

02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:34.020
it. I've done exactly one podcast on it. I had Barry Weiss on my podcast when her book came out

02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:46.900
but it really is a thing and it's something we have to keep an eye on societally because it's a

02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:55.460
unique kind of hatred. It's unique in that it's knit together with, it's not just ordinary racism,

02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:59.300
it's knit together with lots of conspiracy theories that never seem to die out.

02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:05.140
It can by turns equally animate the left and the right politically. It was so perverse about

02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:10.100
antisemitism, look in the American context, with the far right, with white supremacists,

02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:16.100
Jews aren't considered white. So they hate us in the same spirit in which they hate black people

02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:22.180
or brown people or anyone who's not white. But on the left, Jews are considered extra white.

02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:29.220
We're the extra beneficiaries of white privilege. And so we have to be very careful

02:19:29.380 --> 02:19:35.940
and in the black community, that is often the case. We're a minority that has thrived and it

02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:42.820
seems to stand as a counterpoint to all of the problems that other minorities suffer,

02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:48.820
in particular African-Americans in the American context. And yeah, Asians are now getting a

02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:55.780
little bit of this, like the model minority issue, but Jews have had this going on for

02:19:55.780 --> 02:20:02.580
centuries and millennia and it never seems to go away. And again, this is something that I've never

02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:12.100
focused on, but this has been at a slow boil for as long as we've been alive and there's no guarantee

02:20:12.100 --> 02:20:18.020
it can't suddenly become much, much uglier than we have any reason to expect it to become,

02:20:18.020 --> 02:20:24.420
even in our society. And so there's a special concern at moments like that where you have

02:20:25.060 --> 02:20:32.020
an immensely influential person in a community who already has a checkered history with respect

02:20:32.020 --> 02:20:38.180
to their own beliefs about the Jews and the conspiracies and all the rest. And he's just

02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:45.860
messaging, not especially fully opposed by you and anyone else who's given him the microphone

02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:53.140
at that moment to the world. And so that made my spidey sense tingle.

02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:59.460
Yeah, it's complicated. The stakes are very high. And as somebody who's been obviously family and

02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:03.700
also reading a lot about World War II and just this whole period, it was a very difficult

02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:12.580
conversation. But I believe in the power, especially given who I am of not always,

02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:18.660
but sometimes often turning the other cheek. Oh yeah. And again, things change

02:21:18.660 --> 02:21:30.100
when they're for public consumption. The cut for me that has just the use case I keep stumbling upon

02:21:30.100 --> 02:21:35.140
is the kinds of things that I will say on a podcast like this, or if I'm giving a public lecture,

02:21:36.020 --> 02:21:42.420
versus the kinds of things I will say at dinner with strangers or with friends. If you're in an

02:21:42.420 --> 02:21:46.580
elevator, if I'm in an elevator with strangers, I do not feel, and I hear someone say something

02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:56.500
stupid, I don't feel an intellectual responsibility to turn around in the confines of that space with

02:21:56.500 --> 02:22:00.980
them and say, listen, that thing you just said about X, Y, or Z is completely false and here's

02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:07.380
why. But if somebody says it in front of me on some public dais where I'm actually talking about

02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:12.020
ideas, that's when there's a different responsibility that comes online.

02:22:12.020 --> 02:22:14.900
The question is how you say it, how you say it.

02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:21.940
Or even whether you say anything. There are definitely moments to privilege civility or

02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:28.180
just to pick your battles. Sometimes it's just not worth it to get into it with somebody out in real

02:22:28.180 --> 02:22:36.020
life. I just believe in the power of empathy both in the elevator and when a bunch of people are

02:22:36.020 --> 02:22:44.020
listening, that when they see you willing to consider another human being's perspective,

02:22:45.540 --> 02:22:49.460
it just gives more power to your words after.

02:22:50.740 --> 02:23:00.180
Yeah, but until it doesn't. Because you can extend charity too far. It can be absolutely obvious

02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:07.140
what someone's motives really are and they're dissembling about that. Then you're taking at

02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:12.820
face value their representations, it begins to look like you're just being duped and you're not

02:23:12.820 --> 02:23:19.700
actually doing the work of putting pressure on a bad actor. Again, the mental illness component

02:23:19.700 --> 02:23:24.820
here makes it very difficult to think about what you should or shouldn't have said to Kanya.

02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:29.460
I think the topic of platforming is pretty interesting. What's your view on

02:23:30.420 --> 02:23:36.100
platforming controversial people? Let's start with the old, would you interview Hitler

02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:43.060
on your podcast and how would you talk to him? Oh, and follow-up question. Would you interview him

02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:53.860
in 1935, 41, and then like 45? Well, I think we have an uncanny valley problem with

02:23:54.580 --> 02:24:03.060
respect to this issue of whether or not to speak to bad people. If a person is sufficiently bad,

02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:08.100
if they're all the way out of the valley, then you can talk to them and it's just totally

02:24:08.100 --> 02:24:13.620
unproblematic to talk to them because you don't have to spend any time signaling to your audience

02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:16.500
that you don't agree with them. If you're interviewing Hitler, you don't have to say,

02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:20.980
listen, I just got to say before we start, I don't agree with the whole genocide thing.

02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:28.340
I just think you're killing mental patients in vans and all that. That was all bad. It's a bad

02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:35.940
look, Adolf. It can go without saying that you don't agree with this person and you're not

02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:44.980
platforming them to signal boost their views. If they're sufficiently evil, you can go into it

02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:51.700
very much as an anthropologist would. You just want to understand the nature of evil. You just

02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:59.380
want to understand this phenomenon. How is this person who they are? That strikes me as a

02:25:00.420 --> 02:25:08.100
intellectually interesting and morally necessary thing to do. Yes, I think you always interview

02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:11.140
Hitler. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:14.180
Well, once he's Hitler- But when do you know it?

02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:17.620
Once he's legitimately Hitler. But when do you know it? Is genocide

02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:22.580
really happening? It's like 42, 43? No, no. If you're on the cusp of it where

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:27.380
it's just he's someone who's gaining power and you don't want to help facilitate that,

02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:34.020
then there's a question of whether you can undermine him while pushing back against him

02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:38.500
in that interview. There are people I wouldn't talk to just because I don't want to give them

02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:45.300
oxygen and I don't think that in the context of my interviewing them, I'm going to be able to

02:25:45.300 --> 02:25:51.860
take the wind out of their sails at all. It's for whatever, either because an asymmetric advantage

02:25:51.860 --> 02:26:00.260
because I just know that they can do something within the span of an hour that I can't correct

02:26:00.260 --> 02:26:04.980
for. It's like they can light many small fires and it just takes too much time to put them out.

02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:08.420
That's more like on the topic of vaccines, for example, having a debate on the efficacy of

02:26:08.420 --> 02:26:13.540
vaccines. Yeah. It's not that I don't think sunlight is usually the best disinfectant. I

02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:22.740
think it is. Even these asymmetries aside, it is true that a person can always make a mess faster

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:27.380
than you can clean it up, but still there are debates worth having even given that limitation

02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:32.260
and they're the right people to have those specific debates. There are certain topics where

02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:39.220
I'll debate someone just because I'm the right person for the job and it doesn't matter how

02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:44.980
messy they're going to be. It's just worth it because I can make my points land at least

02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:50.340
to the right part of the audience. Some of it is just your own skill and competence and also

02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:54.740
interest in preparing correctly? Well, yeah, and the nature of the subject matter.

02:26:57.380 --> 02:27:00.980
There are other people who just by default I would say, well, there's no reason to give this

02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:08.020
guy a platform. There are also people who are so confabulatory that they're making such a mess

02:27:08.580 --> 02:27:15.940
with every sentence that insofar as you're even trying to interact with what they're saying,

02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:24.420
you're by definition going to fail and you're going to seem to fail to a sufficiently large

02:27:24.420 --> 02:27:29.540
uninformed audience where it's going to be a net negative for the cause of truth

02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:37.620
no matter how good you are. For instance, I think talking to Alex Jones on any topic for any reason

02:27:37.620 --> 02:27:46.260
is probably a bad idea because I just think he's neurologically wired to just utter a string of

02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:53.380
sentences. He'll get 20 sentences out each of which contains more lies than the last

02:27:54.260 --> 02:28:01.700
and there's not time enough in the world to run down and certainly not time enough in the span

02:28:01.700 --> 02:28:08.820
of a conversation to run down each of those leads to bedrock so as to falsify it. He'll just make

02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:20.260
shit up and then weave it in with half truths and micro truths that give some semblance of

02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:24.420
credibility to somebody out there, apparently millions of people out there,

02:28:26.100 --> 02:28:29.940
and there's just no way to untangle that in real time with him.

02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:36.420
I have noticed that you have an allergic reaction to confabulatorization.

02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:38.900
Yeah, confabulation.

02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:47.940
Confabulation, that if somebody says something a little micro untruth, it really stops your brain.

02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:51.460
Here I'm not talking about micro untruth, I'm just talking about making up things out of

02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:57.540
whole cloth. If someone says something like, well, what about, and then the thing they put

02:28:58.180 --> 02:29:06.260
at the end of that sentence is just a set of pseudo facts that you can't possibly authenticate

02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:11.700
or not in the span of that conversation, whether it's about UFOs or anything else,

02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:20.580
they will seem to make you look like an ignoramus when in fact everything they're saying is

02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:24.580
specious, whether they know it or not. There's some people who are just crazy,

02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:29.380
there's some people who are just bullshitting and they're not even tracking whether it's true,

02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:32.820
it just feels good, and then there's some people who are consciously lying about things.

02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:38.820
But don't you think there's just a kind of jazz masterpiece of untruth that you should be able to

02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:45.300
just wave off by saying like, well, none of that is backed up by any evidence, it's just almost like

02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:51.860
take it to the humor place. But the thing is, the place I'm familiar with doing this and not doing

02:29:51.860 --> 02:30:02.580
this is on specific conspiracies like 9-11 truth. Because of what 9-11 did to my

02:30:04.580 --> 02:30:11.780
intellectual life, it sent me down a path for the better part of a decade. I became a critic of

02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:18.260
religion. I don't know if I was ever going to be a critic of religion, but it happened to be in

02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:26.260
my wheelhouse because I spent so much time studying religion on my own. I was also very

02:30:26.260 --> 02:30:38.340
interested in the underlying spiritual concerns of every religion. I devoted more than a full

02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:44.820
decade of my life to just what is real here, what is possible, what is the nature of subjective

02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:51.380
reality and how does it relate to reality at large? Who was someone like Jesus or Buddha?

02:30:51.380 --> 02:31:00.100
And are these people frauds or are these just myths or is there really a continuum of insight

02:31:00.100 --> 02:31:06.900
to be had here that is interesting? So I spent a lot of time on that question through the full

02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:12.100
decade of my 20s. And that was launched in part by 9-11 truth? No, but then when 9-11 happened,

02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:19.380
I had spent all this time reading religious books, empathically understanding the motivations of

02:31:19.380 --> 02:31:26.180
religious people, knowing just how fully certain people believe what they say they believe. So

02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:30.740
I took religious convictions very seriously and then people started flying planes into our

02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:37.220
buildings. So I knew that there was something to be said about the core doctrines of Islam.

02:31:37.780 --> 02:31:48.100
Exactly. So that became my wheelhouse for a time, terrorism and jihadism and related topics.

02:31:48.740 --> 02:31:57.620
And so the 9-11 truth conspiracy thing kept getting aimed at me. And the question was,

02:31:57.620 --> 02:32:02.260
well, do I want to debate these people? Yeah. Alex Jones, perhaps.

02:32:02.260 --> 02:32:06.180
Yeah. So Alex Jones, I think was an early purveyor of it, although I don't think I knew who he was

02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:14.820
at that point. And privately, I had some very long debates with people who, one person in my

02:32:14.820 --> 02:32:20.500
family went way down that rabbit hole. And every six months or so, I'd literally write the two-hour

02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:29.540
email that would try to deprogram them, however ineffectually. And so I went back and forth for

02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:35.220
years on that topic in private with people, but I could see the structure of the conspiracy. I could

02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:47.380
see the nature of how impossible it was to play whack-a-mole sufficiently well so as to convince

02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:55.620
anyone of anything who was not seeing the problematic structure of that way of thinking.

02:32:55.620 --> 02:33:02.660
I mean, it's not actually a thesis. It's a proliferation of anomalies that you can't actually

02:33:02.660 --> 02:33:06.900
connect all the dots that are being pointed to. They don't connect in a coherent way. They're

02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:15.300
incompatible theses, and their incompatibility is not being acknowledged. But they're running

02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:21.540
this algorithm of things are never what they seem. There's always malicious conspirators doing things

02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:28.420
perfectly. We see evidence of human incompetence everywhere else. No one can tie their shoes

02:33:28.820 --> 02:33:36.580
expertly anywhere else. But over here, people are perfectly competent. They're perfectly

02:33:36.580 --> 02:33:43.220
concealing things. Thousands of people are collaborating inexplicably, incentivized by

02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:48.500
what? Who knows? They're collaborating to murder thousands of their neighbors, and no one is

02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:54.660
breathing a peep about it. No one's getting caught on camera. No one's breathe the word of it to a

02:33:54.660 --> 02:34:06.340
journalist. I've dealt with that style of thinking, and I know what it's like to be

02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:12.340
in the weeds of a conversation like that. The person will say, okay, well, but what do you

02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:20.660
make of the fact that all those F-16s were flown 800 miles out to sea on the morning of 9-11 doing

02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:27.460
an exercise that hadn't even been scheduled for that day. Now, all of these, I dimly recall some

02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:32.420
thesis of that kind, but I'm just making these things up now. That detail hadn't even been

02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:38.180
scheduled for that day. It was inexplicably run that day. How long would it take to track that

02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:48.420
down? The idea that this is anomalous. There was an F-16 exercise run, and it wasn't even supposed

02:34:48.420 --> 02:34:56.340
to be run that day. Someone like Alex Jones, their speech pattern is to pack as much of that

02:34:56.340 --> 02:35:03.700
stuff in as possible at the highest velocity that the person can speak, and unless you're knocking

02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:11.700
down each one of those things to that audience, you appear to just be uninformed. He didn't know

02:35:11.700 --> 02:35:17.380
about the F-16s. He doesn't know about Project Mockingbird. You haven't heard about Project

02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:22.180
Mockingbird. I just made up Project Mockingbird. I don't know what it is, but that's the kind of

02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:26.980
thing that comes out tumbling out in a conversation like that. That's the kind of thing, frankly,

02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:32.820
I was worried about in the COVID conversation, because not that someone like Brett would do it

02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:40.260
consciously, but someone like Brett is swimming in a sea of misinformation on social, living on

02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:48.500
Twitter, getting people sending the blog post and the study from the Philippines that showed that in

02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:58.900
this cohort, Ivermectin did X. To actually run anything to ground, you have to actually

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:07.780
do the work journalistically and scientifically and run it to ground. For some of these questions,

02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:14.900
you actually have to be a statistician to say, okay, they used the wrong statistics

02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:22.340
in this experiment. Now, yes, we could take all the time to do that, or we could at every stage

02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:30.740
along the way in a context where we have experts we can trust go with what 97% of the experts are

02:36:30.740 --> 02:36:36.580
saying about X, about the safety of mRNA, about the transmissibility of COVID, about whether to

02:36:36.580 --> 02:36:41.540
wear masks or not wear masks. I completely agree that that broke down

02:36:44.580 --> 02:36:57.140
unacceptably over the last few years. Social media and blogs and the efforts of podcasters and

02:36:57.140 --> 02:37:06.580
Substack writers were not just a response to that. I think it was a symptom of that and a

02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:17.780
cause of that. I think we're living in an environment where we have trained ourselves

02:37:17.780 --> 02:37:25.620
not to be able to agree about facts on any topic, no matter how urgent. What's flying in our sky?

02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:36.420
What's happening in Ukraine? Is Putin just denazifying Ukraine? There are people who

02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:44.580
we respect who are spending time down that particular rabbit hole. Maybe there are a

02:37:44.580 --> 02:37:52.020
lot of Nazis in Ukraine, and that's the real problem. Maybe Putin's not the bad actor here.

02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:58.260
How much time do I have to spend empathizing with Putin to the point of thinking, well,

02:37:58.260 --> 02:38:04.420
maybe Putin's got a point and it's like, what about the polonium and the nerve agents and

02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:11.940
the killing of journalists and the Navalny? I'm not paying so much attention to that because

02:38:11.940 --> 02:38:16.180
I'm following all these interesting people on Twitter and they give me some pro-Putin

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:22.740
material here. There are some Nazis in Ukraine. It's not like there are no Nazis in Ukraine.

02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:27.780
How am I going to weight these things? I think people are being driven crazy by Twitter.

02:38:28.500 --> 02:38:35.780
Yeah, but you're speaking to conspiracy theories that pollute everything. Every example you gave

02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:41.780
is a bad faith style of conversation. But it's not necessarily knowingly bad

02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:49.940
faith. The people who are worried about Ukrainian Nazis, they're some of the same people. They're

02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:57.700
the same people who are worried about ivermectin got suppressed. Ivermectin is really a panacea,

02:38:57.700 --> 02:39:01.300
but it got suppressed because no one could make billions on it.

02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:09.060
It's literally, in many cases, the same people and the same

02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:13.700
efforts to unearth those facts. You're saying it's very difficult

02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:19.380
to have conversations with those kinds of people. What about a conversation with Trump himself?

02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:25.700
Would you do a podcast with Trump? No, I don't think so. I don't think I'd be learning

02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:30.820
anything about him. With Hitler, and I'm not comparing Trump to Hitler.

02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:34.820
Clips guy, here's your chance. You got this one.

02:39:34.820 --> 02:39:42.020
With certain world historical figures, I would just feel like this is an opportunity to learn

02:39:42.020 --> 02:39:47.140
something that I'm not going to learn. I think Trump is among the most superficial people

02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:56.500
we have ever laid eyes on. He is in public view. I'm sure there's some distance between who he is

02:39:56.500 --> 02:40:00.820
in private and who he is in public, but it's not going to be the kind of distance that's going to

02:40:00.820 --> 02:40:13.860
blow my mind. For instance, I think Joe Rogan was very wise not to have Trump on his podcast.

02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:19.620
I think all he would have been doing is he would have put himself in a situation where he couldn't

02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:25.060
adequately contain the damage Trump was doing, and he was just going to make Trump seem cool to a

02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:34.740
whole new, potentially new cohort of his massive audience. They would have had a lot of laughs.

02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:46.340
Trump's funny. The entertainment value of things is so influential. There was that one debate

02:40:46.340 --> 02:40:56.100
where Trump got a massive laugh on his line, only Rosie O'Donnell. The truth is we're living

02:40:56.100 --> 02:41:03.620
in a political system where if you can get a big laugh during a political debate, you win. It doesn't

02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:09.060
matter who you are. It doesn't matter how uninformed you are. It doesn't matter that

02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:15.460
half the debate was about what the hell we should do about a threat of nuclear war or anything else.

02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:20.500
We're monkeys, and we like to laugh.

02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:24.660
Well, because you brought up Joe. He's somebody like you I look up to.

02:41:26.100 --> 02:41:32.340
I've learned a lot from him because I think who he is privately as a human being,

02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:40.020
also he's kind of the voice of curiosity to me. He inspired me that unending open-minded curiosity,

02:41:41.540 --> 02:41:48.340
much like you are the voice of reason. Joe had recently had a podcast with Jordan Peterson,

02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:52.420
and he brought you up saying they still have a hope for you.

02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:59.300
Any chance that you talk to Joe again and reinvigorate your friendship?

02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:04.100
Well, I reached out to him privately when I saw that.

02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:05.380
Did you use the power of love?

02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:09.860
Joe knows I love him and consider him a friend, so there's no issue there.

02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:19.380
He also knows I'll be happy to do his podcast when we get that together. I've got no policy

02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:27.140
of not talking to Joe or not doing his podcast. I think we got a little sideways along these same

02:42:27.140 --> 02:42:34.820
lines where we've talked about Brett and Ilan and other people. It was never, to that degree,

02:42:34.820 --> 02:42:44.260
with Joe because Joe is in a very different lane, and consciously so. Joe is a stand-up comic

02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:52.980
who is interested in everything, interviews the widest conceivable variety of people,

02:42:53.780 --> 02:42:58.820
and just lets his interests collide with their expertise or lack of expertise.

02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:04.180
Again, it's a super wide variety of people. He'll talk about anything,

02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:10.580
and he can always pull the rip cord saying, I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. I'm a comic.

02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:18.340
I'm stoned. We just drank too much. It's very entertaining. To my eye, it's all in good faith.

02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:21.300
I think Joe is an extraordinarily ethical, good person.

02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:23.780
Also doesn't use Twitter. Doesn't really use Twitter.

02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:28.900
Right. Yeah, yeah. The crucial difference though is that because he is

02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:37.540
an entertainer first. I'm not saying he's not smart and he doesn't understand things. What's

02:43:37.540 --> 02:43:42.980
potentially confusing is he's very smart, and he's also very informative. His full-time job

02:43:44.180 --> 02:43:47.460
when he's not doing stand-up or doing color commentary for the UFC,

02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:54.980
his full-time job is talking to lots of very smart people at great length. So he's created

02:43:54.980 --> 02:44:00.580
the Joe Rogan University for himself, and he's gotten a lot of information crammed into his head.

02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:07.940
So it's not that he's uninformed, but when he feels that he's uninformed or when it turns out

02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:12.820
he was wrong about something, he can always pull the rip cord and say, I'm just a comic.

02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:18.180
I'm just a comic. We were stoned. It was fun. Don't take medical advice from me.

02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:26.980
I don't play a doctor on the internet. I can't quite do that. You can't quite do that.

02:44:26.980 --> 02:44:30.340
We're in different lanes. I'm not saying you and I are in exactly the same lane, but

02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:35.300
for much of Joe's audience, I'm just this establishment shill just banging on about

02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:41.860
the universities and medical journals. It's not true, but that would be the perception.

02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:47.860
As a counterpoint to a lot of what's being said on Joe's podcast or certainly Brett's podcast on

02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:55.060
these topics, I can see how they would form that opinion. But in reality, if you listen to me long

02:44:55.060 --> 02:45:02.820
enough, you hear that I've said as much against the woke nonsense as anyone, even any lunatic

02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:10.260
on the right who can only keep that bright shining object in view. So there's nothing that

02:45:10.260 --> 02:45:14.500
Candace Owens has said about wokeness that I haven't said about wokeness in so far as

02:45:14.500 --> 02:45:23.060
she's speaking rationally about wokeness. But we have to be able to keep multiple things in view.

02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:28.740
If you could only look at the problem of wokeness and you couldn't acknowledge the problem of Trump

02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:34.900
and Trumpism and QAnon and the explosion of irrationality that was happening on the right

02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:41.060
and bigotry that was happening on the right, you were just disregarding half of

02:45:41.860 --> 02:45:48.580
the landscape. And many people took half of the problem in recent years. The last five years

02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:53.940
is a story of many people taking half of the problem and monetizing that half of the problem

02:45:53.940 --> 02:46:01.060
and getting captured by an audience that only wanted that half of the problem talked about

02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:11.860
in that way. And this is the larger issue of audience capture, which I'm sure is an ancient

02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:16.660
problem, but it's a very helpful phrase that I think comes to us courtesy of our mutual friend,

02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:25.940
Eric Weinstein. And audience capture is a thing. And I believe I've witnessed many casualties of it.

02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:32.180
And if there's anything I've been on guard against in my life professionally, it's been that. And

02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:38.660
when I noticed that I had a lot of people in my audience who didn't like my criticizing Trump,

02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:44.420
I really leaned into it. And when I noticed that a lot of the other cohort in my audience

02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:50.100
didn't like me criticizing the far left and wokeness, they thought I was exaggerating that

02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:56.820
problem, I leaned into it because I thought those parts of my audience were absolutely wrong and I

02:46:56.820 --> 02:47:03.060
didn't care about whether I was going to lose those parts of my audience. There are people who

02:47:03.060 --> 02:47:08.820
have created, knowingly or not, there are people who've created different incentives for themselves

02:47:09.380 --> 02:47:13.060
because of how they've monetized their podcasts and because of the kind of signal

02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:21.140
they've responded to in their audience. Brett would consider this a totally invidious

02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:29.380
ad hominem thing to say, but I really do worry that that's happened to Brett. I cannot explain

02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:36.420
with all the things in the universe to be interested in and of all the things he's

02:47:36.420 --> 02:47:40.980
competent to speak intelligently about, I don't know how you do a hundred podcasts in a row on

02:47:41.460 --> 02:47:48.100
COVID. It makes no sense. Do you think in part audience capture can explain that?

02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:56.980
I absolutely think it can. For example, do you feel pressure to not admit that you made a mistake on

02:47:56.980 --> 02:48:04.020
COVID or made a mistake on Trump? I'm not saying you feel that way, but do you feel this pressure?

02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:10.740
So you've attacked audience capture within the way you do stuff so you don't feel as much pressure

02:48:10.820 --> 02:48:16.580
from the audience, but within your own ego? Again, the people who think I'm wrong about

02:48:16.580 --> 02:48:23.860
any of these topics are going to think, okay, you're just not admitting that you're wrong,

02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:34.580
but now we're having a dispute about specific facts. There are things that I believed about

02:48:34.580 --> 02:48:41.220
COVID or might be true about COVID two years ago that I no longer believe or I'm not so worried

02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:54.020
about now and vice versa. Certain things have flipped upside down. Here's the cartoon version

02:48:54.020 --> 02:48:59.300
of it, but this is something I said probably 18 months ago and it's still true. When I saw what

02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:10.900
Brett was doing on COVID, let's call it two years ago, I said even if he's right, even if it turns

02:49:10.900 --> 02:49:18.740
out that ivermectin is a panacea and the mRNA vaccines kill millions of people, he's still

02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:27.460
wrong right now. His reasoning is still flawed right now. His facts still suck right now and his

02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:33.700
confidence is unjustified now. That was true then, that will always be true then.

02:49:36.420 --> 02:49:44.740
Not much has changed for me to revisit any of my time points along the way. Again, I will totally

02:49:44.740 --> 02:49:51.780
concede that if I had teenage boys and their schools were demanding that they be vaccinated

02:49:51.780 --> 02:49:59.940
with the mRNA vaccine, I would be powerfully annoyed. I wouldn't know what I was going to

02:49:59.940 --> 02:50:07.780
do and I would be doing more research about myocarditis and I'd be badgering our doctors

02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:13.380
and I would be worried that we have a medical system and a pharmaceutical system and a

02:50:13.380 --> 02:50:18.980
health care system and a public health system that's not incentivized to look at any of this

02:50:18.980 --> 02:50:25.540
in a fine-grained way and they just want one blanket admonition to the entire population,

02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:33.460
just take the shot, you idiots. I view that largely as a result, a panicked response

02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:40.420
to the misinformation explosion that happened and the populist resistance animated by misinformation

02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:46.500
that just made it impossible to get anyone to cooperate. Part of it is, again, a pendulum

02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:51.300
swing in the wrong direction. It's somewhat analogous to the woke response to Trump and

02:50:51.300 --> 02:50:56.740
the Trumpist response to woke. A lot of people have just gotten pushed around for bad reasons

02:50:57.380 --> 02:51:08.260
but understandable reasons. Yes, there are caveats. Things have changed about my view of COVID but

02:51:08.260 --> 02:51:15.220
the question is, if you roll back the clock 18 months, was I wrong to want to platform

02:51:17.460 --> 02:51:27.620
Eric Topol, a very well-respected cardiologist on this topic, or Nicholas Christakis to talk

02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:34.260
about the network effects of whether we should close schools? He's written a book on COVID,

02:51:34.260 --> 02:51:39.460
his network effects are his wheelhouse both as an M.D. and as a sociologist.

02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:51.220
There was a lot that we believed we knew about the efficacy of closing schools during the Spanish

02:51:51.220 --> 02:51:58.180
flu pandemic and others, but there's a lot we didn't know about COVID. We didn't know how

02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:04.420
negligible the effects would be on kids compared to older people.

02:52:04.420 --> 02:52:11.700
We really enjoyed your conversation with Eric Topol but also didn't. He's one of the great

02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:21.300
communicators in many ways on Twitter, distillation of the current data. I hope I'm not overstating

02:52:21.300 --> 02:52:29.460
it but there is a bit of an arrogance from him that I think could be explained by him being

02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:34.100
exhausted by being constantly attacked by conspiracy theorists like anti-vaxxers.

02:52:35.860 --> 02:52:42.020
To me, the same thing happens with people that start drifting to being right wing,

02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:47.620
is to get attacked so much by the left, they become almost irrational and arrogant in their

02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:55.620
beliefs. I felt your conversation with Eric Topol did not sufficiently empathize with people that

02:52:55.620 --> 02:53:02.580
have skepticism but also did not sufficiently communicate uncertainty we have. Many of the

02:53:02.580 --> 02:53:07.620
decisions you made, many of the things you were talking about were saying there's a lot of

02:53:07.620 --> 02:53:11.380
uncertainty but this is the best thing we could do now. Well, it was a forced choice. You're going

02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:18.660
to get COVID. Do you want to be vaccinated when you get it? That was always, in my view, an easy

02:53:18.660 --> 02:53:25.300
choice. Up until you start breaking apart the cohorts and you start saying, okay, wait a minute,

02:53:25.300 --> 02:53:34.260
there is this myocarditis issue in young men. Let's talk about that. Before that story emerged,

02:53:34.900 --> 02:53:44.420
it was just clear that if it's not knocking down transmission as much as we had hoped,

02:53:44.420 --> 02:53:55.140
it is still mitigating severe illness and death. I still believe that it is the current view

02:53:55.860 --> 02:54:02.660
of most people competent to analyze the data that we lost something like 300,000 people

02:54:02.660 --> 02:54:08.660
unnecessarily in the US because of vaccine hesitancy. But I think there's a way to

02:54:08.660 --> 02:54:14.100
communicate with humility about the uncertainty of things that would increase the vaccination rate.

02:54:14.100 --> 02:54:23.940
I do believe that it is rational and sometimes effective to signal impatience with certain

02:54:24.900 --> 02:54:29.700
bad ideas and certain conspiracy theories and certain forms of misinformation.

02:54:29.700 --> 02:54:34.420
Do you think so? I just think it makes you look like a douchebag most times.

02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:38.100
Well, certain people are persuadable. Certain people are not persuadable.

02:54:42.180 --> 02:54:48.580
It's the opportunity cost. Not everything can be given a patient hearing. You can't have a physics

02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:55.540
conference and then let people in to just trumpet their pet theories about the grand unified

02:54:55.540 --> 02:55:00.900
vision of physics when they're obviously crazy or they're obviously half crazy.

02:55:05.540 --> 02:55:10.100
You begin to get a sense for this when it is your wheelhouse, but there are people who

02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:21.060
declare their irrelevance to the conversation fairly quickly without knowing that they have done

02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:33.860
it. The truth is, I think I'm one of those people on the topic of COVID. It's never that I felt,

02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:38.500
listen, I know exactly what's going on here. I know these mRNA vaccines are safe.

02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:47.700
I know exactly how to run a lockdown. No, this is a situation where you want the actual pilots

02:55:47.700 --> 02:55:54.660
to fly the plane. We needed experts who we could trust. Insofar as our experts got captured by

02:55:56.500 --> 02:56:00.580
all manner of things, some of them got captured by Trump. Some of them were made to look ridiculous

02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:06.980
just standing next to Trump while he was bloviating about whatever. It's just going to

02:56:06.980 --> 02:56:11.860
go away. There's just 15 people in a cruise ship and it's just going to go away. There's going to

02:56:11.860 --> 02:56:17.540
be no problem. When he said, many of these doctors think I understand this better than them. They're

02:56:17.540 --> 02:56:22.500
just amazed at how I understand this. You've got doctors, real doctors, the heads of the CDC

02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:31.860
and NIH standing around just ashen-faced while he's talking. All of this was deeply

02:56:31.860 --> 02:56:37.220
corrupting of the public communication of science. Then again, I've banged on about the

02:56:38.020 --> 02:56:45.060
depredations of wokeness. The woke thing was a disaster. It still is a disaster, but it doesn't

02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:51.940
mean that... The thing is, there's a big difference between me and Brett in this case.

02:56:51.940 --> 02:56:57.380
I didn't do 100 podcasts on COVID. I did two podcasts on COVID. The measure of my concern

02:56:57.380 --> 02:57:03.620
about COVID can be measured in how many podcasts I did on it. Once we had a sense of how to live

02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:10.580
with COVID, I was just living with COVID. Okay, get vaxxed or don't get vaxxed. Wear a mask or

02:57:10.580 --> 02:57:14.020
don't wear a mask. Travel or don't travel. You've got a few things to decide, but

02:57:15.060 --> 02:57:21.540
my kids were stuck at home on iPads for too long. I didn't agree with that. It was obviously not

02:57:21.540 --> 02:57:28.340
functional. I criticized that on the margins, but there was not much to do about it. The thing I

02:57:28.340 --> 02:57:36.420
didn't do is make this my life and just browbeat people with one message or another. We need a

02:57:36.420 --> 02:57:41.380
public health regime where we can trust what competent people are saying to us about

02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:49.780
what medicines are safe to take. Even in the presence of that, craziness is going to

02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:54.260
proliferate given the tools we've built, but in the absence of that, it's going to proliferate for

02:57:54.260 --> 02:58:03.140
understandable reasons. It's not going to be good next time when orders of magnitude more dangerous

02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:12.100
hits us. Insofar as I think about this issue, I think much more about next time than this time.

02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:18.740
Before this COVID thing, you and Brett had some good conversations. I would say we're friends.

02:58:19.860 --> 02:58:24.980
What do you admire most about Brett outside of all the criticism we've had about this COVID topic?

02:58:25.380 --> 02:58:33.860
Well, I think Brett is very smart and he's a very ethical person who wants good things for the world.

02:58:33.860 --> 02:58:42.740
I have no reason to doubt that. The fact that we're crosswise on this issue does not mean that I

02:58:42.740 --> 02:58:50.740
think he's a bad person. The thing that worried me about what he was doing, and this was true of Joe

02:58:51.140 --> 02:58:56.340
and this was true of Elon, this is true of many other people, is that once you're messaging at

02:58:56.340 --> 02:59:04.580
scale to a vast audience, you incur a certain kind of responsibility not to get people killed.

02:59:04.580 --> 02:59:11.860
I did worry that, yeah, people were making decisions on the basis of the information

02:59:11.860 --> 02:59:17.940
that was getting shared there. That's why I think I was fairly circumspect. I just said,

02:59:17.940 --> 02:59:25.620
okay, give me the center of the fairway expert opinion at this time point and at this time point

02:59:25.620 --> 02:59:30.660
and at this time point, and then I'm out. I don't have any more to say about this.

02:59:30.660 --> 02:59:34.500
I'm not an expert on COVID. I'm not an expert on the safety of mRNA vaccines.

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:42.500
If something changes so as to become newsworthy, then maybe I'll do a podcast. I just did a podcast

02:59:42.500 --> 02:59:51.860
on the lab leak. I was never skeptical of the lab leak hypothesis. Brett was very early on saying,

02:59:51.860 --> 02:59:58.820
this is a lab leak at a point where my only position was, who cares if it's a lab leak?

03:00:00.420 --> 03:00:04.020
The thing we have to get straight is, what do we do given the nature of this pandemic?

03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:08.660
But also, we should say that you've actually stated that it is a possibility.

03:00:08.980 --> 03:00:10.740
You just said it doesn't quite matter.

03:00:12.260 --> 03:00:18.500
The time to figure that out... Now, I've actually had my podcast guest on this topic

03:00:18.500 --> 03:00:25.380
changed my view of this because one of the guests, Alina Chan, made the point that, no,

03:00:25.380 --> 03:00:31.620
actually the best time to figure out the origin of this is immediately because you lose touch

03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:35.540
with the evidence. I hadn't really been thinking about that. If you come back after a year,

03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:43.860
there are certain facts you might not be able to get in hand, but I've always felt that it didn't

03:00:43.860 --> 03:00:52.420
matter for two reasons. One is, we had the genome of the virus and we were very quickly

03:00:52.420 --> 03:00:56.180
immediately designing vaccines against that genome, and that's what we had to do. Then we

03:00:56.180 --> 03:01:02.900
had to figure out how to vaccinate and to mitigate and to develop treatments and all of that.

03:01:03.540 --> 03:01:13.300
So the origin story didn't matter. Generically speaking, either origin story was politically

03:01:13.300 --> 03:01:18.660
inflammatory and made the Chinese look bad, and the Chinese response to this looked bad,

03:01:18.660 --> 03:01:24.420
whatever the origin story. They're not cooperating. They're stopping their domestic flights,

03:01:24.420 --> 03:01:30.500
but letting their international flights go. They were bad actors and they should be treated as such

03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:38.260
regardless of the origin. I would argue that the wet market origin is even more politically

03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:43.540
invidious than the lab leak origin. Why do you think? Because lab leak, to my eye,

03:01:44.740 --> 03:01:50.180
the lab leak could happen to anyone. All these advanced countries are running these dangerous

03:01:50.180 --> 03:01:58.500
labs. That's a practice that we should be worried about in general. We know lab leaks are a problem.

03:01:58.500 --> 03:02:03.300
There have been multiple lab leaks of even worse things that haven't gotten out of hand in this

03:02:03.300 --> 03:02:13.540
way, but worse pathogens. We're wise to be worried about this, and on some level,

03:02:13.540 --> 03:02:19.780
it could happen to anyone. The wet market makes them look like barbarians living in another

03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:24.900
century. You've got to clean up those wet markets. What are you doing putting a bat on top of a

03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:32.900
pangolin, on top of a duck? Get your shit together. If anything, the wet market makes them look worse,

03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:39.700
in my view. Now, I'm sure what they actually did to conceal a lab leak, if it was a lab leak,

03:02:39.700 --> 03:02:44.260
all of that is going to look odious. Do you think we'll ever get to the bottom of that?

03:02:44.980 --> 03:02:53.780
One of the big negative, I would say, failures of Anthony Fauci and so on is to be transparent

03:02:53.780 --> 03:02:57.540
and clear and just a good communicator about gain and functional research. The dangers of that,

03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:07.300
why it's a useful way of research, but it's also dangerous. Just being transparent about that,

03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:12.740
as opposed to just coming off really shady. Of course, the conspiracy theorists and the politicians

03:03:12.740 --> 03:03:21.300
are not helping, but this just created a giant mess. I would agree. That exchange with Fauci

03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:30.340
and Rand Paul that went viral. Yeah, I would agree that Fauci looked like he was taking refuge

03:03:30.340 --> 03:03:38.500
in very lawyered language and not giving a straightforward account of what we do and why

03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:44.900
we do it. I think it looked shady, it played shady, and it probably was shady. I don't know

03:03:44.900 --> 03:03:51.140
how personally entangled he is with any of this, but yeah, the gain of function research is

03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:59.780
something that I think we're wise to be worried about. Insofar as I judge myself adequate to

03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:09.620
have an opinion on this, I think it should be banned. Probably a podcast I'll do if you or

03:04:09.620 --> 03:04:18.900
somebody else doesn't do it in the meantime. I would like a virologist to defend it against

03:04:18.900 --> 03:04:24.100
a virologist who would criticize it. Forget about just the gain of function research.

03:04:25.220 --> 03:04:30.180
I don't even understand virus hunting at this point. I don't even know why you need to go

03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:37.300
into a cave to find this next virus that could be circulating among bats that may jump zoonotically

03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:45.540
to us. Why do that when we can make, when we can sequence in a day and make vaccines in a weekend?

03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:48.500
What kind of head start do you think you're getting?

03:04:48.500 --> 03:04:51.300
That's a surprising new thing, how quickly you can develop a vaccine.

03:04:51.300 --> 03:04:51.800
Exactly.

03:04:54.180 --> 03:04:57.300
Yeah, that's really interesting, but the shadiness around lab leak.

03:04:58.260 --> 03:05:03.460
I think the point I didn't make about Brett's style of engaging in this issue is people are

03:05:03.460 --> 03:05:09.060
using the fact that he was early on lab leak to suggest that he was right about Ivermectin and

03:05:09.060 --> 03:05:20.020
about mRNA vaccines and all the rest. No, none of that connects. It was possible to be falsely

03:05:20.020 --> 03:05:23.620
confident. You shouldn't have been confident about lab. No one should have been confident

03:05:23.620 --> 03:05:29.220
about lab leak early, even if it turns out to be lab leak. It was always plausible. It was never

03:05:29.220 --> 03:05:36.100
definite. It still isn't definite. Zoonotic is also quite plausible. It certainly was super

03:05:36.100 --> 03:05:44.420
plausible then. Both are politically uncomfortable. Both at the time were inflammatory

03:05:44.980 --> 03:05:49.300
to be banging on about when we were trying to secure some kind of cooperation from the Chinese.

03:05:50.180 --> 03:05:55.220
There's a time for these things and it's possible to be right by accident.

03:05:55.700 --> 03:06:06.180
That's the thing. Your reasoning, the style of reasoning matters whether you're right or not,

03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:12.180
because your style of reasoning is dictating what you're going to do on the next topic.

03:06:15.220 --> 03:06:22.020
Sure, but this is this multivariate situation here. It's really difficult to know what's

03:06:22.020 --> 03:06:27.140
right on COVID given all the uncertainty, all the chaos, especially when you step outside the

03:06:27.140 --> 03:06:34.180
pure biology, virology of it and you start to get into policy. It's just trade-offs.

03:06:35.060 --> 03:06:43.860
Transmissibility of the virus. Just knowing if 65% of the population gets vaccinated,

03:06:43.860 --> 03:06:49.140
what effect would that have? Just even knowing those things, just modeling all those things.

03:06:49.140 --> 03:06:55.540
Given all the other incentives, I mean, Pfizer, I don't know what to think.

03:06:55.540 --> 03:07:00.180
You had the CEO of Pfizer on your podcast. Did you leave that conversation feeling like

03:07:00.980 --> 03:07:03.300
this is a person who is consciously

03:07:08.020 --> 03:07:17.540
reaping windfall profits on a dangerous vaccine and putting everyone at intolerable risk,

03:07:17.540 --> 03:07:24.660
or did you think this person was making a good faith attempt to save lives and had no

03:07:28.580 --> 03:07:35.860
taint of bad incentives or something? The thing I sensed and I felt in part

03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:41.940
it was a failure on my part, but I sensed that I was talking to a politician.

03:07:42.900 --> 03:07:47.140
And so it's not thinking of there was malevolence there or benevolence.

03:07:49.220 --> 03:07:54.100
He just had a job. He put on a suit and I was talking to a suit, not a human being.

03:07:54.980 --> 03:07:59.380
Now he said that his son was a big fan of the podcast, which is why he wanted to do it.

03:07:59.380 --> 03:08:05.220
So I thought I would be talking to a human being and I asked challenging questions what I thought

03:08:05.220 --> 03:08:11.460
the internet thinks otherwise. Every single question in that interview was a challenging

03:08:11.460 --> 03:08:18.660
one, but it wasn't grilling, which is what people seem to want to do with pharmaceutical companies.

03:08:18.660 --> 03:08:21.140
There's a deep distrust of pharmaceutical companies.

03:08:21.140 --> 03:08:26.740
What's the alternative? I totally get that windfall profits at a time of

03:08:27.620 --> 03:08:35.060
public health emergency looks bad. It is a bad look, right? But how do we reward

03:08:36.020 --> 03:08:43.300
and return capital to risk takers who will spend a billion dollars to design a new drug

03:08:43.300 --> 03:08:51.300
for a disease that maybe only harms a single digit percentage of the population? What do we

03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:56.180
want to encourage and who do we want to get rich? The person who cures cancer,

03:08:56.980 --> 03:09:03.140
do we want that person to get rich or not? We want the person who gave us the iPhone to get rich,

03:09:03.140 --> 03:09:07.620
but we don't want the person who cures cancer to get rich. What are we trying to do?

03:09:07.620 --> 03:09:11.860
I think it's a very gray area. So what we want is the person who declares that they have a cure

03:09:11.860 --> 03:09:19.380
for cancer to have authenticity and transparency. I think we're good now as a population smelling

03:09:19.380 --> 03:09:25.300
bullshit. There is something about the Pfizer CEO, for example, just CEOs of pharmaceutical companies

03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:32.980
in general, just because they're so lured up, so much marketing PR people that they are,

03:09:33.780 --> 03:09:40.500
you just smell bullshit. You're not talking to a real human. It just feels like none of it is

03:09:40.500 --> 03:09:48.100
transparent to us as a public. So like this whole talking point that Pfizer is only interested in

03:09:48.100 --> 03:09:53.860
helping people just doesn't ring true, even though it very well could be true. It's the same thing

03:09:53.860 --> 03:09:59.620
with Bill Gates, who seems to be at scale helping a huge amount of people in the world.

03:09:59.620 --> 03:10:03.940
And yet there's something about the way he delivers that message where people like,

03:10:05.060 --> 03:10:09.540
this seems suspicious. What's happening underneath this? There's certain kinds of

03:10:09.540 --> 03:10:16.420
communication styles that seem to be more, serve as better catalysts for conspiracy theories.

03:10:17.140 --> 03:10:20.740
And I'm not sure what that is because I don't think there's an alternative

03:10:21.460 --> 03:10:28.260
for capitalism in delivering drugs that help people. But also at the same time,

03:10:28.260 --> 03:10:32.980
there seems to need to be more transparency and plus like regulation that actually makes sense

03:10:32.980 --> 03:10:38.660
versus it seems like pharmaceutical companies are susceptible to corruption.

03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:47.940
Yeah, I worry about all that, but I also do think that most of the people going into those fields

03:10:47.940 --> 03:10:54.660
and most of the people going into government, they're non-psychopaths trying to get good things

03:10:54.660 --> 03:10:58.660
done and trying to solve hard problems. And they're not trying to get rich. I mean,

03:10:58.660 --> 03:11:08.180
many of the people are, it's like bad incentives or something. Again, I've uttered that phrase

03:11:08.180 --> 03:11:17.380
30 times on this podcast, but it's just almost everywhere it explains normal people creating

03:11:17.940 --> 03:11:27.300
terrible harm. It's not that there are that many bad people. And yes, it makes the truly bad people

03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:32.260
that much more remarkable and worth paying attention to. But the bad incentives and the

03:11:36.260 --> 03:11:43.300
power of bad ideas do much more harm because that's what gets good people running in the wrong

03:11:43.300 --> 03:11:51.220
direction or doing things that are clearly creating unnecessary suffering.

03:11:52.900 --> 03:11:56.660
You've had, and I hope still have, a friendship with Elon Musk,

03:11:57.540 --> 03:12:02.020
especially over the topic of AI. You have a lot of interesting ideas that you both share,

03:12:02.020 --> 03:12:08.340
concerns you both share. Well, let me first ask, what do you admire most about Elon?

03:12:08.340 --> 03:12:18.420
Well, I had a lot of fun with Elon. I like Elon a lot. I mean, Elon, I knew as a friend, I like

03:12:18.420 --> 03:12:28.740
a lot. And it's not going to surprise anyone. I mean, he's done and he's continuing to do

03:12:28.740 --> 03:12:38.260
amazing things. And I think if many of his aspirations are realized, the world will be

03:12:38.260 --> 03:12:43.460
a much better place. I think it's amazing to see what he's built and what he's attempted to

03:12:43.460 --> 03:12:47.460
build and what he may yet build. So with Tesla, with SpaceX, with-

03:12:47.460 --> 03:12:54.340
Yeah, I'm a fan of almost all of that. I mean, there are wrinkles to a lot of that, or some of

03:12:54.340 --> 03:13:00.580
that. All humans are full of wrinkles. There's something very Trumpian about how he's acting

03:13:00.580 --> 03:13:05.460
on Twitter. I mean, Twitter, I think Twitter, he thinks Twitter is great. He bought the place

03:13:05.460 --> 03:13:10.180
because he thinks it's so great. I think Twitter is driving him crazy. I think he's needlessly

03:13:10.180 --> 03:13:16.740
complicating his life and harming his reputation and creating a lot of noise and harming a lot of

03:13:16.740 --> 03:13:23.140
other people. I mean, so the thing that I objected to with him on Twitter is not that he bought it

03:13:23.140 --> 03:13:28.740
and made changes to it. I mean, that was not, again, I remain agnostic as to whether or not

03:13:28.740 --> 03:13:34.500
he can improve the platform. It was how he was personally behaving on Twitter, not just toward

03:13:34.500 --> 03:13:43.620
me, but toward the world. I think when you forward an article about Nancy Pelosi's husband being

03:13:43.620 --> 03:13:51.460
attacked, not as he was by some lunatic, but that it's just some gay trist gonerai, right?

03:13:51.460 --> 03:13:58.020
That's not what it seems. You link to a website that previously claimed that

03:13:58.820 --> 03:14:02.340
Hillary Clinton was dead and that a body double was campaigning in her place.

03:14:03.220 --> 03:14:08.420
That thing was exploding in Trumpistan as a conspiracy theory, right? It was having its

03:14:08.420 --> 03:14:14.660
effect. It matters that he was signal boosting it in front of 130 million people. So it is with

03:14:15.460 --> 03:14:21.380
saying that your former employee, Yoel Roth, is a pedophile, right? I mean,

03:14:21.380 --> 03:14:27.540
that has real consequences. It appeared to be complete bullshit and now this guy's getting

03:14:27.540 --> 03:14:34.660
inundated with death threats, right? All of that's totally predictable, right? So he's behaving quite

03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:41.700
recklessly and there's a long list of things like that that he's done on Twitter. It's not ethical.

03:14:41.700 --> 03:14:50.020
It's not good for him. It's not good for the world. It's not serious. It's a very adolescent

03:14:50.020 --> 03:14:57.540
relationship to real problems in our society. And so my problem with how he's behaved is that he's

03:14:58.820 --> 03:15:04.180
purported to touch real issues by turns, like, okay, do I give the satellites to Ukraine or not?

03:15:04.180 --> 03:15:11.540
Do I minimize their use of them or not? Should I publicly worry about World War III or not,

03:15:12.020 --> 03:15:20.180
right? He's doing this shit on Twitter, right? And at the same moment, he's doing these other very

03:15:21.300 --> 03:15:27.140
impulsive, ill-considered things and he's not showing any willingness to really clean up the

03:15:27.140 --> 03:15:34.180
mess he makes. He brings Kanye on knowing he's an anti-Semite who's got mental health problems

03:15:34.180 --> 03:15:38.500
and then kicks him off for a swastika, which I probably wouldn't have kicked him off for a

03:15:38.500 --> 03:15:45.300
swastika. Can you really kick people off for swastikas? Is that something that you get banned?

03:15:46.340 --> 03:15:51.540
Are you a free speech absolutist if you can't let a swastika show up? I'm not even sure that's an

03:15:51.540 --> 03:15:56.660
enforceable terms of service, right? There are moments to use swastikas that are not conveying

03:15:56.660 --> 03:15:59.460
hate and not raising the risk of violence. Clip that.

03:16:01.620 --> 03:16:07.060
But so much of what he's doing, again, scale matters. He's doing this in front of 130 million

03:16:07.060 --> 03:16:10.660
people. That's very different than a million people and that's very different than 100,000

03:16:10.660 --> 03:16:18.580
people. And so when I went off the tracks with Elon, he was doing this about COVID and again,

03:16:18.580 --> 03:16:26.260
this was a situation where I tried to privately mitigate a friend's behavior and it didn't work

03:16:26.260 --> 03:16:32.580
out very well. Did you try to correct him sort of highlighting things he might be wrong on?

03:16:32.740 --> 03:16:38.500
Or did you use the Lex Powell love method? I should write like a pamphlet for Sam Harris.

03:16:38.500 --> 03:16:43.380
Well, no, but it was totally coming from a place of love because I was concerned about his

03:16:43.380 --> 03:16:48.580
reputation. There was a twofold concern. I could see what was happening with the tweet.

03:16:49.620 --> 03:16:56.020
He'd had this original tweet that was, I think was panic over COVID is dumb or something like

03:16:56.020 --> 03:17:02.260
that. This is early March, 2020. Oh, super early days.

03:17:02.260 --> 03:17:07.780
Super early. When nobody knew anything, but we saw what was happening in Italy. It was totally

03:17:07.780 --> 03:17:12.260
kicking off. God, that was a wild time. That's when the toilet paper-

03:17:12.260 --> 03:17:18.340
It was totally wild. But that became the most influential tweet on Twitter for that week. It

03:17:18.340 --> 03:17:23.300
had more engagement than any other tweet, more than any crazy thing Trump was tweeting. It went off,

03:17:23.300 --> 03:17:33.220
off. Again, it was just a nuclear bomb of information. I could see that people were

03:17:33.220 --> 03:17:39.380
responding to it like, wait a minute. Here's this genius technologist who must have inside

03:17:39.380 --> 03:17:44.740
information about everything. Surely he knows something that is not on the surface about this

03:17:44.740 --> 03:17:51.300
pandemic. They were reading into it a lot of information that I knew wasn't there.

03:17:52.180 --> 03:17:57.620
At the time, I didn't think he had any reason to be suggesting that. I think he was just

03:17:57.620 --> 03:18:03.700
firing off a tweet. I reached out to him in private. Because it was a private

03:18:05.460 --> 03:18:11.380
text conversation, I won't talk about the details, but I'm just saying that's a case.

03:18:12.340 --> 03:18:17.780
Among the many cases of friends who have public platforms and who did something that I thought was

03:18:17.780 --> 03:18:23.860
dangerous and ill-considered, this was a case where I reached out in private and tried to

03:18:26.420 --> 03:18:33.140
help, genuinely help, because I thought it was harmful in every sense.

03:18:33.860 --> 03:18:38.900
Because it was being misinterpreted. You can say that panic over anything is dumb, fine,

03:18:38.900 --> 03:18:45.780
but this was not how this was landing. This was non-issue conspiracy. There's going to be no

03:18:45.780 --> 03:18:50.420
COVID in the US. It's going to peter out. It's just going to become a cold. That's how this was

03:18:50.420 --> 03:18:55.140
getting received. Whereas at that moment, it was absolutely obvious how big a deal this was going

03:18:55.140 --> 03:18:59.540
to be, or that it was going to at minimum going to be a big deal. I don't know if it was obvious,

03:18:59.540 --> 03:19:04.260
but it was obvious there was a significant probability that it could be a big deal.

03:19:04.260 --> 03:19:10.260
I remember in March, it wasn't unclear how big, because there were still stories of it. It's

03:19:10.260 --> 03:19:14.740
probably going to the big concern, the hospitals might overfill, but it's going to die out in two

03:19:14.740 --> 03:19:19.620
months or something. There was no way we weren't going to have

03:19:21.060 --> 03:19:29.300
tens of thousands of deaths at a minimum at that point. It was totally rational to be worried

03:19:29.300 --> 03:19:33.940
about hundreds of thousands. When Nicholas Christakis came on my podcast very early,

03:19:34.660 --> 03:19:39.140
he predicted quite confidently that we would have about a million people dead in the US.

03:19:39.700 --> 03:19:46.660
And that didn't seem, it was, I think appropriately hedged, but it was still, it was just like,

03:19:46.660 --> 03:19:56.820
okay, we're just kind of riding this exponential and it'd be very surprising not to have

03:19:56.820 --> 03:20:00.100
that order of magnitude and not something much less.

03:20:00.740 --> 03:20:08.260
And so anyway, I mean, again, to close the story on Elon,

03:20:10.740 --> 03:20:18.420
I could see how this was being received and I tried to get him to walk that back. And then

03:20:20.180 --> 03:20:28.980
we had a fairly long and detailed exchange on this issue. So that intervention didn't

03:20:29.940 --> 03:20:37.860
work. And it was not done, I was not an asshole. I was just concerned for him, for the world,

03:20:42.980 --> 03:20:48.500
and then there are other relationships where I didn't take the, but again, that's an example

03:20:48.500 --> 03:20:52.980
where taking the time didn't work privately. There are other relations where I thought,

03:20:52.980 --> 03:20:56.900
okay, this is just going to be more trouble than it's worth. And I just ignored it. And

03:20:57.540 --> 03:21:04.260
there's a lot of that. And again, I'm not comfortable with how this is all netted out

03:21:04.260 --> 03:21:10.900
because I don't know if, frankly, I'm not comfortable with how much time in this

03:21:10.900 --> 03:21:15.300
conversation we've spent talking about these specific people. Like what good is it

03:21:16.100 --> 03:21:21.700
for me to talk about Elon or Brett or anything? I think there's a lot of good because those

03:21:21.700 --> 03:21:31.300
friendships, listen, as a fan, these are the conversations I loved, love as a fan,

03:21:31.300 --> 03:21:36.900
and it feels like COVID has robbed the world of these conversations because you were exchanging

03:21:36.900 --> 03:21:41.220
back and forth on Twitter, but that's not what I mean by conversations, like long-form discussions,

03:21:41.220 --> 03:21:44.980
like a debate about COVID, like a normal debate.

03:21:44.980 --> 03:21:49.380
But there's no, there is no, Elon and I shouldn't be debating COVID.

03:21:49.380 --> 03:21:53.940
You should be. Here's the thing with humility, like basically saying, we don't really know,

03:21:53.940 --> 03:21:59.700
like the Rogan method. We're just a bunch of idiots. Like one is an engineer, you're a

03:21:59.700 --> 03:22:04.900
neuroscientist, but like it just kind of, okay, here's the evidence and be like normal people.

03:22:04.900 --> 03:22:09.700
That's what everybody was doing. The whole world was like trying to figure out what the hell, what-

03:22:09.700 --> 03:22:14.740
Yeah, but the issue was that at that, so at the moment I had this collision with Elon,

03:22:14.740 --> 03:22:21.380
and certain things were not debatable. It was just, it was absolutely clear where this was

03:22:21.380 --> 03:22:26.260
going. It wasn't clear how far it was going to go or how quickly we would mitigate it, but

03:22:26.900 --> 03:22:29.220
it was absolutely clear that it was going to be an issue.

03:22:31.380 --> 03:22:36.900
The train had come off the tracks in Italy. We knew we weren't going to seal our borders.

03:22:37.860 --> 03:22:44.580
There were already people who, there are already cases known to many of us personally in the US

03:22:44.580 --> 03:22:54.100
at that point. And he was operating by a very different logic that I couldn't engage with.

03:22:54.100 --> 03:22:59.380
Sure, but that logic represents a part of the population. And there's a lot of interesting

03:22:59.380 --> 03:23:03.940
topics that have a lot of uncertainty around them, like the effectiveness of masks, like-

03:23:04.420 --> 03:23:09.140
No, but where things broke down was not at the point of, oh, there's a lot to talk about,

03:23:09.140 --> 03:23:14.660
a lot to debate, this is all very interesting, and who knows what's what. It broke down very early at

03:23:15.620 --> 03:23:23.940
this is, there's nothing to talk about here. Either there's a water bottle on the table

03:23:23.940 --> 03:23:30.420
or there isn't, right? Well, technically there's only one-fourth of a water bottle.

03:23:31.380 --> 03:23:35.700
So what defines a water bottle? Is it the water inside the water bottle or is it the water bottle?

03:23:35.700 --> 03:23:38.260
What I'm giving you as an example of is worth a conversation.

03:23:38.980 --> 03:23:47.460
This is difficult because we had an exchange in private and I want to honor not exposing

03:23:47.460 --> 03:23:56.340
the details of it, but the details convinced me that there was not a follow-up conversation

03:23:56.340 --> 03:24:04.020
on that topic. On this topic. That said, I hope and I hope to be part of helping that happen that

03:24:04.020 --> 03:24:08.820
the friendship is rekindled because one of the topics I care a lot about, artificial intelligence,

03:24:10.340 --> 03:24:13.620
you've had great public and private conversations about this topic.

03:24:14.420 --> 03:24:21.460
Yeah, and Elon was very formative in my taking that issue seriously. He and I went to that initial

03:24:22.340 --> 03:24:27.300
conference in Puerto Rico together and it was only because he was going and I found out about

03:24:27.300 --> 03:24:34.820
it through him and I just wrote his coattails to it that I got dropped in that side of the pool

03:24:36.020 --> 03:24:40.900
to hear about these concerns at that point. It would be interesting to hear how has your

03:24:42.100 --> 03:24:51.140
concern evolved with the coming out of Chad GPT and these new large language models that are fine

03:24:51.140 --> 03:24:57.700
tuned with reinforcement learning and seemingly to be able to do some incredible human-like things.

03:24:57.700 --> 03:25:02.980
There's two questions. One, how is your concern in terms of AGI and super intelligence evolved

03:25:02.980 --> 03:25:08.500
and how impressed are you with Chad GPT as a student of the human mind and mind in general?

03:25:10.020 --> 03:25:18.020
Well, my concern about AGI is unchanged. I've spoken about it a bunch on my podcast,

03:25:18.020 --> 03:25:25.540
but I did a TED talk in 2016, which was the summary of what that conference and

03:25:27.220 --> 03:25:32.180
various conversations I had after that did to my brain on this topic.

03:25:33.620 --> 03:25:40.020
Basically, that once super intelligence is achieved, there's a takeoff. It becomes

03:25:40.020 --> 03:25:46.020
exponentially smarter and in a matter of time, they're just we're ants and they're gods.

03:25:46.580 --> 03:25:52.500
Well, yeah, unless we find some way of permanently tethering

03:25:54.180 --> 03:26:04.100
a super intelligent self-improving AI to our value system. I don't believe anyone has figured out how

03:26:04.100 --> 03:26:07.380
to do that or whether that's even possible in principle. I know people like Stuart Russell,

03:26:07.380 --> 03:26:12.900
who I just had on my podcast. Oh, really? Have you released it yet?

03:26:12.900 --> 03:26:16.900
Haven't released it yet. He's been on previous podcasts, but we just recorded this week.

03:26:17.460 --> 03:26:21.460
Because you haven't done an AI podcast in a while, so it's great. He's a good person

03:26:21.460 --> 03:26:28.100
to talk about alignment with. Stuart has been probably more than anyone

03:26:28.100 --> 03:26:31.940
my guru on this topic. You're reading his book and doing, I think I've done

03:26:32.580 --> 03:26:35.540
two podcasts with him at this point. I think it's called The Control

03:26:35.540 --> 03:26:38.980
Problem or something like that. His book is human compatible.

03:26:39.060 --> 03:26:41.300
Human compatible. He talks about the control problem.

03:26:43.940 --> 03:26:50.500
I just think the idea that we can define a value function in advance that permanently tethers

03:26:51.220 --> 03:27:01.940
a self-improving super intelligent AI to our values as we continue to discover them, refine them,

03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:09.300
extrapolate them in an open-ended way. I think that's a tall order and I think there are many

03:27:09.300 --> 03:27:14.900
more ways. There must be many more ways of designing super intelligence that is not aligned

03:27:14.900 --> 03:27:20.660
in that way and is not ever approximating our values in that way. Stuart's idea to

03:27:21.860 --> 03:27:27.620
put it in a very simple way is that he thinks you don't want to specify the value function

03:27:27.620 --> 03:27:33.060
up front. You don't want to imagine you could ever write the code in such a way as to admit

03:27:33.060 --> 03:27:42.740
of no loophole. You want to make the AI uncertain as to what human values are and perpetually

03:27:42.740 --> 03:27:49.220
uncertain and always trying to ameliorate that uncertainty by hewing more and more closely to

03:27:49.220 --> 03:27:55.620
what our professed values are. It's always interested in saying, oh, no, no, that's not

03:27:55.620 --> 03:28:00.180
what we want. That's not what we intend. Stop doing that. No matter how smart it gets,

03:28:00.180 --> 03:28:06.180
all it wants to do is more perfectly approximate human values. I think there are a lot of problems

03:28:06.180 --> 03:28:10.180
with that at a high level. I'm not a computer scientist, so I'm sure there are many problems

03:28:10.180 --> 03:28:15.620
at a low level that I don't understand. How to force a human into the loop always,

03:28:15.620 --> 03:28:22.820
no matter what. There's that and what humans get a vote and what do humans value and

03:28:23.380 --> 03:28:28.340
what is the difference between what we say we value and our revealed preferences?

03:28:31.060 --> 03:28:37.300
If you were a super intelligent AI that could look at humanity now, I think you could be

03:28:37.300 --> 03:28:44.100
forgiven for concluding that what we value is driving ourselves crazy with Twitter and

03:28:44.100 --> 03:28:51.940
living perpetually on the brink of nuclear war and just watching hot girls in yoga pants on TikTok

03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:54.660
again and again and again. And you're saying that is not?

03:28:55.460 --> 03:29:01.540
This is all revealed preference and it's what is an AI to make of that and what should it optimize?

03:29:04.100 --> 03:29:10.500
This is also Stuart's observation that one of the insidious things about the YouTube algorithm is

03:29:10.500 --> 03:29:18.740
it's not that it just caters to our preferences. It actually begins to change us in ways so as to

03:29:18.740 --> 03:29:25.540
make us more predictable. It finds ways to make us a better reporter of our preferences

03:29:26.340 --> 03:29:32.020
and to trim our preferences down so that it can further train to that signal.

03:29:33.140 --> 03:29:40.900
The main concern is that most of the people in the field seem not to be taking intelligence

03:29:40.900 --> 03:29:47.540
seriously. As they design more and more intelligent machines and as they profess

03:29:47.540 --> 03:29:57.220
to want to design true AGI, again, they're not spending the time that Stuart is spending

03:29:57.220 --> 03:30:02.580
trying to figure out how to do this safely above all. They're just assuming that these

03:30:03.780 --> 03:30:08.420
problems are going to solve themselves as we make that final stride into the end zone

03:30:08.420 --> 03:30:19.220
or they're saying very Pollyannaish things like an AI would never form a motive to harm human. Why

03:30:19.220 --> 03:30:26.020
would it ever form a motive to be malicious toward humanity unless we put that motive in there?

03:30:26.820 --> 03:30:30.020
That's not the concern. The concern is that in the presence of

03:30:30.980 --> 03:30:39.380
of vast disparities in competence and certainly in a condition where the machines are improving

03:30:39.380 --> 03:30:45.460
themselves or improving their own code, they could be developing instrumental goals

03:30:46.420 --> 03:30:53.220
that are antithetical to our wellbeing without any intent to harm us. It's analogous to what we do to

03:30:53.220 --> 03:30:59.460
to every other species on earth. You and I don't consciously form the intention

03:31:00.340 --> 03:31:06.820
to harm insects on a daily basis, but there are many things we could intend to do that would,

03:31:06.820 --> 03:31:12.820
in fact, harm insects because you decide to repave your driveway or whatever you're doing.

03:31:13.460 --> 03:31:19.540
You're just not taking the interest of insects into account because they're so far beneath you

03:31:20.180 --> 03:31:26.580
in terms of your cognitive horizons. The real challenge here is that

03:31:28.340 --> 03:31:34.260
if you believe that intelligence scales up on a continuum toward heights that

03:31:35.540 --> 03:31:39.460
we can only dimly imagine, and I think there's every reason to believe that. There's no reason

03:31:39.460 --> 03:31:48.100
to believe that we're near the summit of intelligence. Maybe there are some forms

03:31:48.100 --> 03:31:55.300
of intelligence for which this is not true, but for many relevant forms, like the top 100 things

03:31:55.300 --> 03:31:59.780
we care about cognitively, I think there's every reason to believe that many of those things,

03:31:59.780 --> 03:32:06.100
most of those things, are a lot like chess or Go, where once the machines get better than we are,

03:32:06.100 --> 03:32:09.300
they're going to stay better than we are, although I don't know if you caught the

03:32:09.300 --> 03:32:12.100
recent thing with Go where this guy actually came out of Stewart's lab.

03:32:12.100 --> 03:32:13.140
One. Yeah.

03:32:13.140 --> 03:32:17.060
Yeah. One time a human beat a machine in Go.

03:32:17.780 --> 03:32:24.020
They found a hack for that. Anyway, ultimately, there's going to be no looking back. Then the

03:32:24.020 --> 03:32:33.780
question is, what do we do in relationship to these systems that are more competent than we

03:32:33.780 --> 03:32:41.300
are in every relevant respect? Because it will be a relationship. The people who think we're just

03:32:41.300 --> 03:32:47.380
going to figure this all out without thinking about it in advance, the solutions are just going

03:32:47.380 --> 03:32:58.180
to find themselves seem not to be taking the prospect of really creating autonomous super

03:32:58.180 --> 03:33:06.340
intelligence seriously. What does that mean? It's every bit as independent and ungovernable,

03:33:06.340 --> 03:33:11.620
ultimately, as us having created. Just imagine if we created a race of people

03:33:12.180 --> 03:33:16.900
that were 10 times smarter than all of us. How would we live with those people? They're

03:33:16.900 --> 03:33:21.460
10 times smarter than us. They begin to talk about things we don't understand. They begin

03:33:21.460 --> 03:33:26.660
to want things we don't understand. They begin to view us as obstacles to them. They're solving

03:33:26.660 --> 03:33:33.060
those problems or gratifying those desires. We become the chickens or the monkeys in their

03:33:33.060 --> 03:33:43.860
presence. I think that it's but for some amazing solution of the sort that Stewart is imagining,

03:33:43.860 --> 03:33:49.300
that we could somehow anchor their reward function permanently, no matter how intelligent scales.

03:33:49.860 --> 03:34:00.820
I think it's really worth worrying about this. I do buy the sci-fi notion that this is an

03:34:00.820 --> 03:34:06.740
existential risk if we don't do it well. I worry that we don't notice it. I'm deeply

03:34:06.740 --> 03:34:13.700
impressed with Chad GPT and I'm worried that it will become super intelligent. These language

03:34:13.700 --> 03:34:16.900
models will become super intelligent because they're basically trained in the collective

03:34:16.900 --> 03:34:21.780
intelligence of the human species. Then it will start controlling our behavior if they're

03:34:21.780 --> 03:34:29.220
integrated into our algorithms, the recommender systems. Then we just won't notice that there's

03:34:29.860 --> 03:34:33.140
a super intelligent system that's controlling our behavior.

03:34:33.940 --> 03:34:40.260
Well, I think that's true even far before super intelligence, even before general intelligence.

03:34:40.260 --> 03:34:49.780
I think just the narrow intelligence of these algorithms and of what something like Chad GPT

03:34:50.340 --> 03:35:05.140
can do. I mean, it's just far short of it developing its own goals that are at cross

03:35:05.140 --> 03:35:12.420
purposes with ours. Just the unintended consequences of using it in the ways we're

03:35:12.420 --> 03:35:17.700
going to be incentivized to use it and the money to be made from scaling this thing

03:35:18.420 --> 03:35:25.220
and what it does to our information space and our sense of just being able to get to ground truth

03:35:27.060 --> 03:35:36.740
on any facts. Yeah, it's super scary. Do you think it's a giant leap in terms of development

03:35:36.740 --> 03:35:46.740
towards AGI, Chad GPT, or is this just an impressive little toolbox? When do you think

03:35:46.740 --> 03:35:51.540
the singularity is coming? Or is it to you it doesn't matter if it's eventually?

03:35:51.540 --> 03:35:56.820
I have no intuitions on that front apart from the fact that if we continue to make progress,

03:35:56.820 --> 03:36:03.060
it will come. You just have to assume we continue to make progress. There's only two assumptions.

03:36:03.060 --> 03:36:08.820
You have to assume substrate independence. There's no reason why this can't be done in

03:36:08.820 --> 03:36:16.820
silico. We can build arbitrarily intelligent machines. There's nothing magical about having

03:36:17.540 --> 03:36:23.380
this done in the wetware of our own brains. I think that is true and I think that's scientifically

03:36:23.380 --> 03:36:28.420
parsimonious to think that that's true. Then you just have to assume we're going to keep

03:36:28.420 --> 03:36:31.940
making progress. It doesn't have to be any special rate of progress. It doesn't have to be Moore's

03:36:31.940 --> 03:36:38.980
law. We just keep going. At a certain point, we're going to be in relationship to minds.

03:36:40.020 --> 03:36:46.580
Leaving consciousness aside, I don't have any reason to believe that they'll necessarily

03:36:46.580 --> 03:36:52.500
be conscious by virtue of being super intelligent and that's its own interesting ethical question.

03:36:52.500 --> 03:37:02.500
But leaving consciousness aside, they're going to be more competent than we are and then that's

03:37:02.500 --> 03:37:11.060
like the aliens have landed. That's an encounter with, again, leaving aside the possibility that

03:37:11.060 --> 03:37:19.780
something like Stuart's path is actually available to us. But it is hard to picture

03:37:20.100 --> 03:37:27.060
if what we mean by intelligence, all things considered, and it's truly general, if that

03:37:27.060 --> 03:37:42.260
scales and begins to build upon itself how you maintain that perfect slavish devotion

03:37:42.900 --> 03:37:45.060
until the end of time in those systems.

03:37:45.060 --> 03:37:53.540
The tether to humans. I think my gut says that tether is not, there's a lot of ways to do it.

03:37:54.500 --> 03:37:57.300
It's not this increasingly impossible problem.

03:38:01.140 --> 03:38:05.780
As you know, I'm not a computer scientist. I have no intuitions about algorithmically

03:38:05.780 --> 03:38:08.420
how you would approach that and what's possible.

03:38:08.420 --> 03:38:14.340
My main intuition is maybe deeply flawed, but the main intuition is based on the fact that most of

03:38:14.340 --> 03:38:21.060
the learning is currently happening on human knowledge. Even Chad GPT is just trained on

03:38:21.060 --> 03:38:28.820
human data. I don't see where the takeoff happens where you completely go above human wisdom.

03:38:29.460 --> 03:38:35.380
The current impressive aspect of Chad GPT is that's using collective intelligence of all of us.

03:38:36.740 --> 03:38:40.980
From what I glean, again, from people who know much more about this than I do,

03:38:41.620 --> 03:38:48.420
I think we have reason to be skeptical that these techniques of deep learning

03:38:49.300 --> 03:38:56.260
are actually going to be sufficient to push us into AGI. They're not generalizing in the

03:38:56.260 --> 03:39:03.860
way they need to. They're certainly not learning like human children. There's brittle and strange

03:39:03.860 --> 03:39:14.260
ways. It's not to say that the human path is the only path. We might learn better lessons by

03:39:14.260 --> 03:39:22.660
ignoring the way brains work, but we know that they don't generalize and use abstraction the

03:39:22.660 --> 03:39:28.660
way we do. They have strange holes in their competence.

03:39:28.820 --> 03:39:35.140
The size of the holes is shrinking every time. The intuition starts to slowly fall apart.

03:39:36.340 --> 03:39:41.060
The intuition is like, surely it can't be this simple to achieve superintelligence,

03:39:42.340 --> 03:39:48.580
but it's becoming simpler and simpler. The progress is quite incredible. I've been extremely

03:39:48.580 --> 03:39:52.900
impressed with Chad GPT and the new models, and there's a lot of financial incentive to make

03:39:52.900 --> 03:39:58.180
progress in this regard. We're going to be living through some very interesting times.

03:39:58.660 --> 03:40:06.180
In raising a question that I'm going to be talking to you, a lot of people brought up

03:40:06.180 --> 03:40:11.380
this topic, probably because Eric Weinstein talked to Joe Rogan recently and said that he and you

03:40:11.380 --> 03:40:17.620
were contacted by folks about UFOs. Can you clarify the nature of this contact?

03:40:20.580 --> 03:40:25.220
I've got very little to say on this. He has much more to say. I think he went down

03:40:26.020 --> 03:40:33.140
this rabbit hole further than I did, which wouldn't surprise anyone. He's got much more

03:40:33.140 --> 03:40:37.220
of a taste for this sort of thing than I do, but I think we were contacted by the same person.

03:40:38.260 --> 03:40:42.900
It wasn't clear to me who this person was or how this person got my cell phone number.

03:40:47.380 --> 03:40:51.460
It didn't seem like we were getting punked. The person seemed credible to me.

03:40:52.180 --> 03:40:54.980
And they were talking to you about the release of different videos on UFOs.

03:40:54.980 --> 03:40:59.940
Yeah. This is when there was a flurry of activity around this. There was a big New Yorker

03:41:00.500 --> 03:41:08.500
article on UFOs, and there was rumors of congressional hearings, I think, coming,

03:41:10.180 --> 03:41:13.540
and there were the videos that were being debunked or not.

03:41:16.420 --> 03:41:20.820
This person contacted both of us, I think, around the same time. I think he might have contacted

03:41:20.820 --> 03:41:24.820
Rogan or other... Eric is just the only person I've spoken to about it, I think,

03:41:26.740 --> 03:41:37.780
who I know was contacted. What happened is the person kept writing a check that he didn't

03:41:37.780 --> 03:41:44.980
cash. He kept saying, okay, next week, I understand this is sounding spooky and you have no reason to

03:41:44.980 --> 03:41:50.660
really trust me, but next week, I'm going to put you on a Zoom call with people who you will

03:41:50.660 --> 03:41:57.060
recognize and they're going to be former heads of the CIA and people who just... Within five

03:41:57.060 --> 03:42:02.980
seconds of being on the Zoom call, you'll know this is not a hoax. I said, great, just let me know,

03:42:02.980 --> 03:42:11.540
send me the Zoom link. That happened maybe three times. There was just one phone conversation and

03:42:11.540 --> 03:42:20.500
then it was just texts, just a bunch of texts. I think Eric spent more time with this person

03:42:20.500 --> 03:42:23.940
and I haven't spoken to him about it. I know he spoke about it publicly, but

03:42:27.700 --> 03:42:32.740
it's not that my bullshit detector ever really went off in a big way. It's just the thing never

03:42:32.740 --> 03:42:37.860
happened and so I lost interest. You made a comment, which is interesting,

03:42:39.380 --> 03:42:44.900
which I really appreciate, that you ran the thought experiment of saying, okay, maybe we do have

03:42:45.380 --> 03:42:53.220
alien spacecraft or just the thought experiment the aliens did visit and then this very nihilistic,

03:42:53.220 --> 03:42:59.380
sad thought that it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't affect your life. Can you explain that?

03:42:59.940 --> 03:43:06.100
Well, no, I think many people noticed this. This was a sign of how crazy

03:43:06.820 --> 03:43:12.180
the news cycle was at that point. We had COVID and we had Trump and I forget when the UFO thing

03:43:12.180 --> 03:43:18.740
was really kicking off, but it just seemed like no one had the bandwidth to even be interested in

03:43:18.740 --> 03:43:27.860
this. I was amazed to notice in myself that I wasn't more interested in figuring out what was

03:43:27.860 --> 03:43:37.220
going on and I considered, okay, wait a minute. If this is true, this is the biggest story in

03:43:37.220 --> 03:43:43.060
anyone's lifetime. Contact with alien intelligence is by definition the biggest

03:43:43.060 --> 03:43:52.100
story in anyone's lifetime in human history. Why isn't this just totally captivating?

03:43:53.140 --> 03:43:57.460
Not only was it not totally captivating, it was just barely rising to the level of

03:43:58.420 --> 03:44:08.820
my being able to pay attention to it. I view that, one, as to some degree an understandable

03:44:08.820 --> 03:44:15.460
defense mechanism against the bogus claims that have been made about this kind of thing in the

03:44:15.460 --> 03:44:23.780
past. The general sense is probably bullshit or it probably has some explanation that is purely

03:44:23.780 --> 03:44:31.060
terrestrial and not surprising. There is somebody who, what's his name? Is it Mick West? I forget.

03:44:31.060 --> 03:44:33.620
Is it a YouTuber? Yeah. He debunks stuff.

03:44:33.620 --> 03:44:40.900
Yeah. I have since seen some of those videos. This is going back still at least a year,

03:44:40.900 --> 03:44:46.980
but some of those videos seem like fairly credible debunkings of some of the optical evidence.

03:44:46.980 --> 03:44:55.300
I'm surprised we haven't seen more of that. There was a fairly credulous 60 minutes piece

03:44:55.300 --> 03:44:59.540
that came out around that time looking at some of that video. It was the very video that he

03:44:59.540 --> 03:45:07.300
was debunking on YouTube. His video only had 50,000 views on it or whatever. But again,

03:45:07.300 --> 03:45:11.300
it seemed like a fairly credible debunking. I haven't seen debunkings of his debunkings.

03:45:11.380 --> 03:45:17.700
But I think there is, but he's basically saying that there is possible explanations for it.

03:45:18.340 --> 03:45:22.580
Usually in these kinds of contexts, if there's a possible explanation, even if it seems unlikely,

03:45:23.620 --> 03:45:28.820
it's going to be more likely than an alien civilization visiting us.

03:45:28.820 --> 03:45:32.100
Yeah. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence principle,

03:45:32.100 --> 03:45:36.740
which I think is generally true. Well, with aliens, I think generally,

03:45:37.460 --> 03:45:42.180
I think there should be some humility about what they would look like when they show up.

03:45:42.180 --> 03:45:45.860
I tend to think they're already here. The amazing thing about this AI conversation,

03:45:45.860 --> 03:45:50.340
though, is that we're talking about a circumstance where we would be designing

03:45:51.060 --> 03:45:57.940
the aliens and there's every reason to believe that eventually this is going to happen. I'm not

03:45:57.940 --> 03:46:03.460
at all skeptical about the coming reality of the aliens and we're going to build them.

03:46:03.460 --> 03:46:07.220
Now, here's the thing. Does this apply to when super intelligence shows up?

03:46:08.100 --> 03:46:13.060
Will this be trending on Twitter for a day and then we'll go on to complain about

03:46:14.020 --> 03:46:20.420
something Sam Harris once again said on his podcast next day? You tend to trend on Twitter,

03:46:20.420 --> 03:46:22.580
even though you're not on Twitter, which is great.

03:46:22.580 --> 03:46:28.260
Yeah. I haven't noticed. I did notice when I was on.

03:46:28.260 --> 03:46:35.620
But you have this concern about AGI, basically the same kind of thing

03:46:35.620 --> 03:46:38.580
that we would just look the other way. Is there something about this time where

03:46:39.380 --> 03:46:43.780
even like World War Three, which has been throwing it on very casually,

03:46:44.420 --> 03:46:48.740
concerningly so even that the new cycle wipes that away?

03:46:48.740 --> 03:46:51.140
Yeah. Well, I think we have this

03:46:51.620 --> 03:47:05.940
general problem that we can't make certain information, even unequivocally certain

03:47:05.940 --> 03:47:16.100
information emotionally salient. We respond quite readily to certain things. As we talked about,

03:47:16.100 --> 03:47:22.980
we respond to the little girl who fell down a well. That gets 100% of our emotional resources.

03:47:23.940 --> 03:47:32.180
But the abstract probability of nuclear war, even a high probability, even an intolerable

03:47:32.180 --> 03:47:42.260
probability, even if we put it at 30%, it's just like that's a Russian roulette with a gun with

03:47:42.260 --> 03:47:47.140
three chambers. It's aimed at the heads, not only your head, but your kid's head and everyone's

03:47:47.140 --> 03:47:56.900
kid's head. It's just 24 hours a day. This pre-Ukraine, I think the people who have made

03:47:56.900 --> 03:48:03.780
it their business professionally to think about the risk of nuclear war and to mitigate it,

03:48:03.780 --> 03:48:12.500
people like Graham Allison or William Perry. I think they were putting the ongoing risk,

03:48:13.220 --> 03:48:20.580
the risk that we're going to have a proper nuclear war at some point in the next generation,

03:48:21.940 --> 03:48:27.460
people were putting it at something like 50%. They were living with this sword of Damocles

03:48:27.460 --> 03:48:34.180
over our heads. Now, you might wonder whether anyone can have reliable intuitions about the

03:48:34.180 --> 03:48:40.740
probability of that kind of thing, but the status quo is truly alarming. We've got

03:48:42.420 --> 03:48:49.780
ICBMs on, leave aside smaller exchanges and tactical nukes and how we could have a world war

03:48:50.580 --> 03:48:54.420
based on incremental changes. We've got

03:48:57.300 --> 03:49:04.500
the biggest bombs aimed at the biggest cities in both directions and it's old technology

03:49:06.660 --> 03:49:15.460
and it's vulnerable to some lunatic deciding to launch or misreading bad data. We know we've

03:49:15.460 --> 03:49:27.060
been saved from nuclear war I think at least twice by Soviet submarine commanders deciding,

03:49:27.060 --> 03:49:34.340
I'm not going to pass this up the chain of command. This is almost certainly an error

03:49:34.340 --> 03:49:43.620
and it turns out it was an error. In that particular case, he saw, I think it was five

03:49:44.580 --> 03:49:51.220
what seemed like five missiles launched from the US to Russia and he reasoned if America was going

03:49:51.220 --> 03:49:57.140
to engage in a first strike, they'd launch more than five missiles. This has to be fictional

03:49:57.140 --> 03:50:04.260
and then he waited long enough to decide that it was fictional. The probability of a nuclear war

03:50:04.500 --> 03:50:11.540
happening by mistake or some other species of inadvertence, misunderstanding,

03:50:13.300 --> 03:50:20.660
technical malfunction, that's intolerable. Forget about the intentional use of it by

03:50:21.300 --> 03:50:29.540
people who are driven crazy by some ideology. And more and more technologies are enabled

03:50:29.540 --> 03:50:35.780
at a scale of destruction. And misinformation plays into this picture in a way that is

03:50:36.580 --> 03:50:44.580
especially scary. Once you can get a deep fake of any current president of the United States

03:50:44.580 --> 03:50:51.220
claiming to have launched a first strike and just send that everywhere.

03:50:51.220 --> 03:50:54.900
But that could change the nature of truth and then that might change the

03:50:55.860 --> 03:51:01.860
the engine we have for skepticism. It sharpened it. The more you have deep

03:51:01.860 --> 03:51:06.820
fakes. Yeah, and we might have AI and digital watermarks that help us. Maybe we'll

03:51:07.460 --> 03:51:15.780
not trust any information that hasn't come through specific channels. In my world,

03:51:15.780 --> 03:51:27.940
I no longer feel the need to respond to anything other than what I put out in my channels of

03:51:27.940 --> 03:51:34.340
information. There's so many people who have clipped stuff of me that shows the opposite

03:51:34.340 --> 03:51:38.820
of what I was actually saying in context. The people who have re-edited my podcast audio to

03:51:38.820 --> 03:51:45.300
make it seem like I said the opposite of what I was saying. Unless I put it out, you can't be sure

03:51:45.300 --> 03:51:55.300
that I actually said it. But I don't know what it's like to live like that for all forms of

03:51:55.300 --> 03:52:05.380
information. Strangely, I think it may require a greater siloing of information in the end.

03:52:08.580 --> 03:52:13.140
We're living through this Wild West period where everyone's got a newsletter and everyone's got a

03:52:13.140 --> 03:52:18.420
blog and everyone's got an opinion, but once you can fake everything. There might be a greater

03:52:18.420 --> 03:52:24.500
value for expertise for experts, but a more rigorous system for identifying who the experts

03:52:24.500 --> 03:52:31.220
are. Yeah, or just knowing that it's going to be an arms race to authenticate information.

03:52:32.820 --> 03:52:38.900
You can never trust a photograph unless it has been vetted by Getty Images,

03:52:39.700 --> 03:52:45.860
because only Getty Images has the resources to authenticate the provenance of that photograph

03:52:45.860 --> 03:52:52.260
and a test that hasn't been meddled with by AI. Again, I don't even know if that's technically

03:52:52.260 --> 03:53:00.580
possible. Maybe whatever the tools available for this will be commodified and the cost will

03:53:00.580 --> 03:53:04.740
be driven to zero so quickly that everyone will be able to do it. It could be like encryption.

03:53:05.620 --> 03:53:10.820
And it would be proven and tested most effectively first, of course, as always in porn,

03:53:11.860 --> 03:53:15.060
which is where most of human innovation technology happens first.

03:53:17.060 --> 03:53:20.340
Well, I have to ask because Ron Howard, the director, asked us on Twitter,

03:53:21.140 --> 03:53:24.740
since we're talking about the threat of nuclear war and otherwise,

03:53:24.740 --> 03:53:29.460
he asked, I'd be interested in both your expectations for human society if when we move

03:53:29.460 --> 03:53:35.620
beyond Mars. Will those societies be industrial-based? How will it be governed? How

03:53:35.620 --> 03:53:41.940
will criminal infractions be dealt with? When you read or watch sci-fi, what comes closest to

03:53:41.940 --> 03:53:48.100
sounding logical? Do you think about our society beyond Earth if we colonize Mars, if we colonize

03:53:48.100 --> 03:53:55.780
space? Yeah, well, I think I have a pretty humbling picture of that because we're still going to be

03:53:55.780 --> 03:54:02.500
the apes that we are. So when you imagine colonizing Mars, you have to imagine a first

03:54:02.500 --> 03:54:06.020
fistfight on Mars. You have to imagine a first murder on Mars.

03:54:06.020 --> 03:54:11.460
Or also infidelity. Yeah, extramarital affairs on Mars. So it's going to get

03:54:13.460 --> 03:54:19.780
really homely and boring really fast, I think. It's like only the spacesuits or the other

03:54:19.780 --> 03:54:26.820
other exigencies of just living in that atmosphere or lack thereof will limit

03:54:27.780 --> 03:54:31.620
how badly we can behave on Mars. But do you think most of the interaction

03:54:31.620 --> 03:54:38.740
will be still in meat space versus digital? Do you think we're living through a transformation

03:54:38.740 --> 03:54:43.460
of a kind where we're going to be doing more and more interaction than digital space?

03:54:44.740 --> 03:54:49.540
Everything we've been complaining about Twitter, is it possible that Twitter's just the early days

03:54:49.540 --> 03:54:55.380
of a broken system that's actually giving birth to a better working system that's ultimately digital?

03:54:56.900 --> 03:55:05.460
I think we're going to experience a pendulum swing back into the real world. I think many

03:55:05.460 --> 03:55:12.580
of us are experiencing that now anyway. Just wanting to have face-to-face encounters and

03:55:12.580 --> 03:55:18.340
spend less time on our phones and less time online. I think maybe everyone isn't going in

03:55:18.340 --> 03:55:27.220
that direction, but I do notice it myself. Once I got off Twitter, then I noticed the people who

03:55:27.220 --> 03:55:35.700
were never on Twitter. I have a lot of friends who are never on Twitter, and they actually

03:55:35.700 --> 03:55:40.820
never understood what I was doing on Twitter. It wasn't that they were seeing it and then

03:55:41.780 --> 03:55:48.500
reacting to it, they just didn't know. It's like I'm not on Reddit either,

03:55:48.500 --> 03:55:52.660
but I don't spend any time thinking about not being on Reddit. I'm just not on Reddit.

03:55:53.940 --> 03:55:56.980
Do you think the pursuit of human happiness is better achieved,

03:55:56.980 --> 03:56:00.500
more effectively achieved outside of Twitter world?

03:56:02.260 --> 03:56:08.980
Well, I think all we have is our attention in the end. We just have to notice what these various

03:56:08.980 --> 03:56:19.220
tools are doing to it. It became very clear to me that it was an unrewarding use of my attention.

03:56:19.220 --> 03:56:23.780
Now, it's not to say there isn't some digital platform that's conceivable that would be

03:56:24.740 --> 03:56:38.260
useful and rewarding, but yeah, our life is doled out to us in moments. We're continually

03:56:38.260 --> 03:56:46.820
solving this riddle of what is going to suffice to make this moment engaging and meaningful and

03:56:47.940 --> 03:56:55.620
aligned with who I want to be now and how I want the future to look. We have this tension between

03:56:56.420 --> 03:57:04.660
being in the present and becoming in the future. It's a seeming paradox. Again,

03:57:04.660 --> 03:57:10.900
it's not really a paradox, but I do think the ground truth for personal well-being

03:57:11.940 --> 03:57:18.740
is to find a mode of being where you can pay attention to the present moment,

03:57:18.740 --> 03:57:23.540
and this is meditation by another name. You can pay attention to the present moment

03:57:24.100 --> 03:57:32.660
with sufficient gravity that you recognize that just consciousness itself in the present moment,

03:57:32.660 --> 03:57:39.620
no matter what's happening, is already a circumstance of freedom and contentment

03:57:39.620 --> 03:57:46.340
and tranquility. You can be happy now before anything happens, before this next desire

03:57:46.340 --> 03:57:51.700
gets gratified, before this next problem gets solved. There's this ground truth that you're

03:57:51.700 --> 03:57:59.060
free, that consciousness is free and open and unencumbered by really any problem until you get

03:57:59.060 --> 03:58:03.700
lost in thought about all the problems that may yet be real for you.

03:58:03.700 --> 03:58:09.620
So the ability to catch and observe consciousness, that in itself is a source of happiness.

03:58:09.620 --> 03:58:16.180
Without being lost in thought. This happens haphazardly for people who don't meditate

03:58:16.180 --> 03:58:20.820
because they find something in their life that's so captivating, it's so pleasurable,

03:58:20.820 --> 03:58:26.820
it's so thrilling. It can even be scary, but it can be even being scared is captivating.

03:58:27.220 --> 03:58:35.300
It gets their attention, whatever it is. Sebastian Younger wrote a great book about

03:58:36.100 --> 03:58:41.860
people's experience in war here. Strangely, it can be the best experience anyone's ever had

03:58:41.860 --> 03:58:47.780
because everything, it's like only the moment matters. The bullet is whizzing by your head.

03:58:47.780 --> 03:58:54.020
You're not thinking about your 401k or that thing that you didn't say last week to the person you

03:58:54.020 --> 03:58:57.300
shouldn't have been talking about. You're not thinking about Twitter. It's like you're just

03:58:58.340 --> 03:59:03.940
fully immersed in the present moment. Meditation is the only way.

03:59:05.620 --> 03:59:10.100
That word can mean many things to many people, but what I mean by meditation is simply the discovery

03:59:10.100 --> 03:59:18.900
that there is a way to engage the present moment directly, regardless of what's happening. You

03:59:18.900 --> 03:59:22.580
don't need to be in a war, you don't need to be having sex, you don't need to be on drugs,

03:59:22.580 --> 03:59:28.420
you don't need to be surfing. It doesn't have to be a peak experience. It can be completely ordinary,

03:59:28.420 --> 03:59:36.420
but you can recognize that in some basic sense, there's only this and everything else is something

03:59:36.420 --> 03:59:40.340
you're thinking. You're thinking about the past, you're thinking about the future,

03:59:40.340 --> 03:59:46.180
and thoughts themselves have no substance. It's fundamentally mysterious that any thought

03:59:47.140 --> 03:59:54.180
ever really commandeers your sense of who you are and makes you anxious or afraid or angry

03:59:54.180 --> 04:00:00.420
or whatever it is. The more you discover that, the half-life of all these negative emotions that

04:00:00.420 --> 04:00:10.180
blow all of us around get much, much shorter. The anger that would have kept you angry for

04:00:10.180 --> 04:00:17.860
hours or days lasts four seconds because the moment it arises, you recognize it and you can

04:00:17.860 --> 04:00:22.980
get off it. At minimum, you can decide whether it's useful to stay angry at that moment.

04:00:24.020 --> 04:00:27.700
Obviously, it usually isn't. The illusion of free will is one of those thoughts.

04:00:28.260 --> 04:00:34.660
Yeah, it's all just happening. Even the mindful and meditative response to this is just happening.

04:00:34.980 --> 04:00:40.420
It's just like even the moments where you recognize or not recognize is just happening.

04:00:42.660 --> 04:00:47.700
This does open up a degree of freedom for a person, but it's not a freedom that gives any

04:00:47.700 --> 04:00:53.060
motivation to the notion of free will. It's just a new way of being in the world.

04:00:53.060 --> 04:00:57.140
Is there a difference between intellectually knowing free will is an illusion and

04:00:57.860 --> 04:01:02.340
really experiencing it? What's the longest you've been able to experience?

04:01:03.140 --> 04:01:05.540
The escape, the illusion of free will?

04:01:06.340 --> 04:01:13.460
Well, it's always obvious to me when I pay attention. Whenever I'm mindful,

04:01:14.500 --> 04:01:19.940
the term of jargon in the Buddhist and increasingly outside the Buddhist context

04:01:19.940 --> 04:01:24.980
is mindfulness. There are different levels of mindfulness and there's different

04:01:24.980 --> 04:01:31.620
different degrees of insight into this. But yes, what I'm calling evidence of lack of

04:01:31.620 --> 04:01:37.940
free will and lack of the self, I've got two sides of the same coin. There's a sense of being

04:01:39.140 --> 04:01:45.380
a subject in the middle of experience to whom all experience refers, a sense of I, a sense of me.

04:01:47.620 --> 04:01:52.820
That's almost everybody's starting point when they start to meditate. That's almost always the place

04:01:52.820 --> 04:01:57.860
people live most of their lives from. I do think that gets interrupted in ways they get

04:01:57.860 --> 04:02:02.820
unrecognized. I think people are constantly losing the sense of I. They're losing the sense of subject

04:02:02.820 --> 04:02:11.300
to object distance, but they're not recognizing it. Meditation is the mode in which you can

04:02:11.300 --> 04:02:16.500
recognize. You can both consciously precipitate it. You can look for the self and fail to find it and

04:02:17.140 --> 04:02:23.140
then recognize its absence. That's just the flip side of the coin of free will.

04:02:24.740 --> 04:02:30.980
The feeling of having free will is what it feels like to feel like a self who's thinking his

04:02:30.980 --> 04:02:37.540
thoughts and doing his actions and intending his intentions. The man in the middle of the boat

04:02:37.540 --> 04:02:45.140
who's rowing, that's the false starting point. When you find that there's no one in the middle

04:02:45.140 --> 04:02:50.820
of the boat or in fact, there's no boat. There's just the river. There's just the flow of experience

04:02:51.940 --> 04:02:55.860
and there's no center to it and there's no place from which you would control it.

04:02:55.860 --> 04:03:00.420
Again, even when you're doing things, this does not negate the difference between voluntary and

04:03:00.420 --> 04:03:07.300
involuntary behavior. It's like I can voluntarily reach for this, but when I'm paying attention,

04:03:07.300 --> 04:03:13.540
I'm aware that everything is just happening. The intention to move is just arising.

04:03:15.300 --> 04:03:24.260
I'm in no position to know why it didn't arise a moment before or a moment later or 50% stronger

04:03:24.260 --> 04:03:30.580
or weaker or so as to be ineffective or to be doubly effective where I lurched for it versus

04:03:30.580 --> 04:03:40.580
I move slow. I can never run the counterfactuals. All of this opens the door to an

04:03:40.580 --> 04:03:47.780
even more disconcerting picture along the same lines, which subsumes this conversation about

04:03:47.780 --> 04:03:58.740
free will and it's the question of whether anything is ever possible. This is a question

04:03:58.740 --> 04:04:04.420
I haven't thought a lot about it, but it's been a few years. I've been kicking this question around.

04:04:04.420 --> 04:04:16.660
I mean, what if only the actual is possible? We live with this feeling of possibility. We

04:04:16.660 --> 04:04:29.060
live with the sense that I have two daughters. I could have had a third child. What does it mean

04:04:29.060 --> 04:04:32.820
to say that I could have had a third child? You don't have kids, I don't think.

04:04:33.700 --> 04:04:36.980
Not that I know of. The possibility might be there.

04:04:37.860 --> 04:04:47.540
What do we mean when we say you could have had a child or you might have a child in the future?

04:04:49.460 --> 04:04:57.380
What is the relationship between possibility and actuality and reality? Is there a reality in which

04:04:57.380 --> 04:05:09.300
non-actual things are nonetheless real? We have other categories of non-concrete things. We have

04:05:09.300 --> 04:05:17.780
things that don't have spatial temporal dimension, but they nonetheless exist, like the integers,

04:05:18.420 --> 04:05:26.980
numbers. There's an abstract reality to numbers and it's philosophically interesting to think

04:05:26.980 --> 04:05:36.580
about these things. In some sense, they're real and they're not merely invented by us. They're

04:05:36.580 --> 04:05:41.780
discovered because they have structure that we can't impose upon them. They're not fictional

04:05:41.780 --> 04:05:48.980
characters. Hamlet and Superman also exist in some sense, but they exist at the level of our own

04:05:49.940 --> 04:05:56.340
fiction and abstraction. They're true and false statements you can make about Hamlet.

04:05:56.340 --> 04:06:02.260
They're true and false statements you can make about Superman because the fictional worlds we've

04:06:02.260 --> 04:06:07.860
created have a certain kind of structure, but it's all abstract. It's all abstractable from

04:06:07.860 --> 04:06:12.660
any of its concrete instantiations. It's not just in the comic books and just in the movies.

04:06:12.660 --> 04:06:21.700
It's in our ongoing ideas about these characters, but natural numbers or the integers don't

04:06:22.020 --> 04:06:27.220
function quite that way. They're similar, but they also have a structure that's purely a matter

04:06:27.220 --> 04:06:33.620
of discovery. You can't just make up whether numbers are prime. If you give me two integers

04:06:34.820 --> 04:06:40.100
of a certain size, you mentioned two enormous integers. If I were to say,

04:06:40.100 --> 04:06:46.660
okay, well, between those two integers, they're exactly 11 prime numbers. That's a very specific

04:06:47.460 --> 04:06:51.700
claim about which I can be right or wrong, whether or not anyone knows I'm right or wrong.

04:06:52.740 --> 04:06:58.900
There's a domain of facts there, but it's an abstract reality that relates in some way that's

04:06:58.900 --> 04:07:03.940
philosophically interesting, metaphysically interesting to what we call real reality,

04:07:04.580 --> 04:07:13.220
the spatial temporal order, the physics of things. But possibility, at least in my view,

04:07:13.220 --> 04:07:20.500
occupies a different space. Again, my thoughts on this are pretty incoherent. I think I need to

04:07:20.500 --> 04:07:26.500
talk to a philosopher of physics and or a physicist about how this may interact with

04:07:26.500 --> 04:07:28.740
things like the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

04:07:28.740 --> 04:07:36.020
That's an interesting way. Exactly. I wonder if discoveries in physics like further proof

04:07:36.020 --> 04:07:39.780
or more concrete proof that many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics has some

04:07:40.420 --> 04:07:43.780
validity if that completely starts to change things.

04:07:43.780 --> 04:07:53.940
But that's just more actuality. If I took that seriously, that's a case of, and truth is,

04:07:53.940 --> 04:07:59.540
that happens even if the many worlds interpretation isn't true, but we just imagine we have a

04:07:59.540 --> 04:08:06.020
physically infinite universe. The implication of infinity is such that things will begin to

04:08:06.020 --> 04:08:13.300
repeat themselves the farther you go in space. If you just head out in one direction, eventually

04:08:13.300 --> 04:08:17.380
you're going to meet two people just like us having a conversation just like this,

04:08:17.380 --> 04:08:23.380
and you're going to meet them an infinite number of times in every infinite variety of permutations

04:08:23.380 --> 04:08:28.740
slightly different from this conversation. Infinity is just so big that our intuitions

04:08:28.740 --> 04:08:35.700
of probability completely break down. But what I'm suggesting is maybe probability isn't a thing.

04:08:36.260 --> 04:08:43.780
Maybe there's only actuality. Maybe there's only what happens, and at every point along the way,

04:08:44.740 --> 04:08:49.140
our notion of what could have happened or what might have happened is just that. It's just a

04:08:49.140 --> 04:08:53.860
thought about what could have happened or might have happened. So it's a fundamentally different

04:08:53.860 --> 04:09:00.340
thing. If you can imagine a thing that doesn't make it real, because that's where that possibility

04:09:00.340 --> 04:09:06.660
exists is in your imagination. Right? Yeah. And possibility itself is a kind of spooky idea

04:09:06.660 --> 04:09:12.020
because it too has a sort of structure. Right? So if I'm going to say,

04:09:17.860 --> 04:09:21.620
you could have had a daughter last year.

04:09:21.620 --> 04:09:33.540
So we're saying that's possible, but not actual. Right? That is a claim. There are things that

04:09:34.980 --> 04:09:41.300
are true and not true about that daughter. Right? It has a kind of structure. I feel like there's a

04:09:41.300 --> 04:09:48.100
lot of fog around the possibility. It feels like almost like a useful narrative.

04:09:48.340 --> 04:09:57.860
What does it mean? If we say, I just did that, but it's conceivable that I wouldn't have done that.

04:09:57.860 --> 04:10:02.660
It's possible that I just threw this cap, but I might not have done that.

04:10:02.660 --> 04:10:07.860
So you're taking it very temporally close to the original, what would appear as a decision?

04:10:08.660 --> 04:10:13.620
Whenever we're saying something is possible, but not actual. Right? This thing just happened,

04:10:14.420 --> 04:10:18.820
but it's possible that it wouldn't have happened or that it would have happened differently.

04:10:20.500 --> 04:10:27.460
In what does that possibility consist? Where is that? For that to be real,

04:10:28.020 --> 04:10:35.300
for the possibility to be real, what claim are we making about the universe?

04:10:35.300 --> 04:10:39.860
Well, isn't that an extension of the idea that free will is an illusion? That all we have is

04:10:39.860 --> 04:10:44.580
sexuality, that the possibility is an illusion. Right. Yeah. I'm just extending it beyond human

04:10:44.580 --> 04:10:50.660
action. This goes to the physics of things. This is just everything. We're always telling

04:10:50.660 --> 04:10:56.260
ourselves a story that includes possibility. Possibility is really compelling for some reason.

04:10:58.100 --> 04:11:08.900
Well, yeah. This could sound just academic, but every backward looking regret or disappointment

04:11:09.540 --> 04:11:16.340
and every forward looking worry is completely dependent on this notion of possibility.

04:11:17.300 --> 04:11:21.060
Every regret is based on the sense that I could have done something else,

04:11:21.060 --> 04:11:26.260
something else could have happened. Every disposition to worry about the future

04:11:27.380 --> 04:11:31.620
is based on the feeling that there's this range of possibilities. It could go either way.

04:11:32.580 --> 04:11:40.260
And whether or not there's such a thing as possibility, I'm convinced that worry is almost

04:11:40.260 --> 04:11:47.780
never psychologically appropriate because the reality is in any given moment, either you can

04:11:47.780 --> 04:11:51.780
do something to solve the problem you're worried about or not. So if you can do something, just do

04:11:51.780 --> 04:11:58.820
it. And if you can't, your worrying is just causing you to suffer twice over. You're going to get the

04:11:58.820 --> 04:12:03.700
medical procedure next week anyway. How much time between now and next week do you want to spend

04:12:03.700 --> 04:12:09.460
worrying about it? The worry doesn't accomplish anything. How much do physicists think about

04:12:09.460 --> 04:12:15.140
possibility? Well, they think about it in terms of probability more often, but probability just

04:12:15.140 --> 04:12:22.020
describes, and again, this is a place where I might be out of my depth and need to talk to

04:12:22.100 --> 04:12:32.180
somebody to debunk this. But probably it seems just describes a pattern of actuality that we've

04:12:32.180 --> 04:12:38.100
observed. There are certain things we observe and those are the actual things that have happened.

04:12:38.740 --> 04:12:44.180
And we have this additional story about probability. We have the frequency with

04:12:44.180 --> 04:12:53.460
which things have happened in the past. I can flip a fair coin and I know in the abstract

04:12:53.460 --> 04:13:00.740
that I have a belief that in the limit, those flips, those tosses should converge on 50% heads

04:13:00.740 --> 04:13:07.540
and 50% tails. I have a story as to why it's not going to be exactly 50% within any arbitrary

04:13:07.540 --> 04:13:18.180
timeframe. But in reality, all we ever have are the observed tosses. And then we have an

04:13:18.180 --> 04:13:24.820
additional story that, oh, it came up heads, but it could have come up tails. Why do we think that

04:13:26.260 --> 04:13:34.260
about that last toss? And what are we claiming is true about the physics of things

04:13:34.260 --> 04:13:41.380
if we say it could have been otherwise? I think we're claiming that probability is true,

04:13:42.660 --> 04:13:49.300
that it allows us to have a nice model about the world. It gives us hope about the world.

04:13:49.300 --> 04:13:55.700
Yeah. It seems that possibility has to be somewhere to be effective. It's a little bit like

04:13:55.700 --> 04:14:00.020
what's happening with the laws of nature. There's something metaphysically interesting about the

04:14:00.020 --> 04:14:07.540
laws of nature too. The laws of nature impose their work on the world. We see their evidence,

04:14:08.580 --> 04:14:15.220
but they're not reducible to any specific set of instances. There's some structure there,

04:14:16.100 --> 04:14:22.580
but the structure isn't just a matter of the actual things. We have the actual billiard balls

04:14:22.580 --> 04:14:27.380
that are banging into each other. All of that actuality can be explained by what actual things

04:14:27.380 --> 04:14:32.820
are actually doing. But then we have this notion that in addition to that, we have the laws of

04:14:32.820 --> 04:14:39.380
nature that are explaining this act. But how are the laws of nature an additional thing in addition

04:14:39.380 --> 04:14:44.100
to just the actual things that actually affect causally? And if they are an additional thing,

04:14:45.140 --> 04:14:50.100
how are they effective if they're not among the actual things that are just actually banging

04:14:50.100 --> 04:14:57.220
around? I see. Possibly has to be hiding somewhere for the laws of nature to be

04:14:57.220 --> 04:15:03.700
possible. For anything to be possible, it has to be. It's a closet somewhere, I'm sure,

04:15:03.700 --> 04:15:06.500
where all the possibility goes. It has to be attached to something.

04:15:08.660 --> 04:15:13.300
You don't think Many Worlds is that? Because Many Worlds still exists.

04:15:14.100 --> 04:15:21.700
We're in this strand of that multiverse. Still, you have just the local instance of what is actual.

04:15:22.260 --> 04:15:26.020
And then if it proliferates elsewhere where you can't be affected by it,

04:15:26.100 --> 04:15:29.060
Many Worlds says you can't really connect with the other.

04:15:30.820 --> 04:15:37.060
So Many Worlds is just a statement of basically everything that can happen happens somewhere.

04:15:40.500 --> 04:15:47.060
Maybe that's not an entirely kosher formulation of it, but it seems pretty close. But there's

04:15:47.060 --> 04:15:56.980
whatever happens. In fact, relativistically, Einstein's original notion of a block universe

04:15:57.780 --> 04:16:01.620
seems to suggest this. It's been a while since I've been in a conversation with a physicist where

04:16:01.620 --> 04:16:05.460
I've gotten a chance to ask about the standing of this concept in physics currently. I don't hear

04:16:05.460 --> 04:16:13.300
it discussed much, but the idea of a block universe is that space-time exists as a totality

04:16:14.100 --> 04:16:20.260
and our sense that we are traveling through space-time where there's a real difference

04:16:20.260 --> 04:16:29.300
between the past and the future, that that's an illusion of just the weird slice we're taking of

04:16:29.300 --> 04:16:36.580
this larger object. But on some level, it's like you're reading a novel. The last page of the novel

04:16:36.580 --> 04:16:43.060
exists just as much as the first page when you're in the middle of it. And if we're

04:16:43.060 --> 04:16:49.620
living in anything like that, then there's no such thing as possibility. It would seem there's

04:16:49.620 --> 04:16:58.340
just what is actual. So as a matter of our experience moment to moment, I think it's

04:16:58.340 --> 04:17:05.780
totally compatible with that being true, that there is only what is actual. And that sounds

04:17:06.420 --> 04:17:11.140
to the naive ear, that sounds like it would be depressing and disempowering and confining,

04:17:11.780 --> 04:17:18.660
but it's anything but. It's actually a circumstance of pure discovery. You have no idea

04:17:19.300 --> 04:17:24.020
what's going to happen next. You don't know who you're going to be tomorrow. You're only by

04:17:24.020 --> 04:17:29.780
tendency seeming to resemble yourself from yesterday. There's way more freedom in all of

04:17:29.780 --> 04:17:39.300
that than it seems true to many people. And yet the basic insight is that you're not

04:17:41.380 --> 04:17:45.700
in the real freedom is the recognition that you're not in control of anything.

04:17:46.260 --> 04:17:50.420
Everything is just happening, including your thoughts and intentions and moves.

04:17:50.420 --> 04:17:54.100
So life is a process of continuous discovery.

04:17:54.100 --> 04:18:02.100
You're part of the universe. You are just this. I mean, it's the miracle that the universe is

04:18:02.100 --> 04:18:08.580
illuminated to itself as itself, where you sit, and you're continually discovering

04:18:09.460 --> 04:18:14.980
what your life is. And then you have this layer at which you're telling yourself a story

04:18:15.780 --> 04:18:20.340
that you already know what your life is, and you know exactly who you should be and what's

04:18:21.540 --> 04:18:26.180
about to happen, or you're struggling to form a confident opinion about all of that.

04:18:26.180 --> 04:18:32.260
And yet there is this fundamental mystery to everything, even the most familiar experience.

04:18:33.060 --> 04:18:37.620
We're all NPCs in a most marvelous video game.

04:18:38.980 --> 04:18:44.020
Maybe, although my sense of gaming does not run as deep as to know what I'm committing to there.

04:18:44.740 --> 04:18:45.940
It's a non-playing character.

04:18:45.940 --> 04:18:50.740
You're more of a Mario Kart guy.

04:18:51.780 --> 04:18:56.980
I was an original video gamer, but it's been a long time since I was there for Pong.

04:18:57.860 --> 04:19:00.900
I remember when I saw the first Pong in a restaurant in,

04:19:02.420 --> 04:19:06.020
I think it was like Benny Hanna's or something. They had a Pong table.

04:19:06.020 --> 04:19:08.020
And that was an amazing moment.

04:19:08.900 --> 04:19:14.660
You, Sam Harris, might live from Pong to the invention and deployment of a super intelligent

04:19:15.460 --> 04:19:15.860
system.

04:19:15.860 --> 04:19:18.980
Yeah. Well, that happened fast if it happens anytime in my lifetime.

04:19:19.780 --> 04:19:25.540
From Pong to AGI, what kind of things do you do purely for fun that others might consider

04:19:25.540 --> 04:19:26.340
a waste of time?

04:19:27.940 --> 04:19:29.140
Purely for fun.

04:19:30.660 --> 04:19:34.260
Because meditation doesn't count because most people would say that's not a waste of time.

04:19:34.820 --> 04:19:36.340
Is there something like Pong?

04:19:38.020 --> 04:19:40.260
That's a deeply embarrassing thing you would never admit.

04:19:42.740 --> 04:19:47.140
I don't think, well, I mean, once or twice a year, I will play a round of golf,

04:19:47.140 --> 04:19:48.900
which many people would find embarrassing.

04:19:49.700 --> 04:19:52.500
They might even find my play embarrassing, but it's fun.

04:19:52.500 --> 04:19:53.860
Do you find it embarrassing?

04:19:53.860 --> 04:19:59.140
No. Golf just takes way too much time, so I can only squander a certain amount of time on it.

04:19:59.140 --> 04:20:01.220
I do love it. It's a lot of fun.

04:20:01.220 --> 04:20:05.780
Well, you have no control over your actual performance. You're ever discovering.

04:20:07.220 --> 04:20:12.020
I have control over my mediocre performance, but I don't have enough control as to make it

04:20:12.020 --> 04:20:17.700
really good. But happily, I'm in the perfect spot because I don't invest enough time in it

04:20:17.700 --> 04:20:20.340
to care how I play, so I just have fun when I play.

04:20:20.340 --> 04:20:23.860
Well, I hope there'll be a day where you play around golf with

04:20:23.860 --> 04:20:27.380
the former president, Donald Trump, and I would love to be.

04:20:27.380 --> 04:20:30.420
I would bet on him if we played golf. I'm sure he's a better golfer.

04:20:31.860 --> 04:20:35.940
Amidst the chaos of human civilization in modern times, as we've talked about,

04:20:35.940 --> 04:20:42.580
what gives you hope about this world in the coming year, in the coming decade,

04:20:42.580 --> 04:20:47.700
in the coming hundred years, maybe a thousand years? What's the source of hope for you?

04:20:50.420 --> 04:20:57.940
Well, it comes back to a few of the things we've talked about. I think I'm hopeful. I know that

04:20:57.940 --> 04:21:06.340
most people are good and are mostly converging on the same core values. It's like we're not

04:21:06.340 --> 04:21:15.620
surrounded by psychopaths. The thing that finally convinced me to get off Twitter was

04:21:16.260 --> 04:21:21.540
how different life was seeming through the lens of Twitter. I just got the sense that there's

04:21:21.540 --> 04:21:26.820
way more psychopaths or effective psychopaths than I realized, and then I thought, okay,

04:21:27.620 --> 04:21:33.460
this isn't real. This is either a strange context in which actually decent people are behaving like

04:21:33.460 --> 04:21:41.940
psychopaths or it's a bot army or something that I don't have to take seriously. So yeah,

04:21:41.940 --> 04:21:52.020
I just think most people, if we can get the incentives right, I think there's no reason

04:21:52.020 --> 04:22:02.740
why we can't really thrive collectively. There's enough wealth to go around. There's no effective

04:22:02.740 --> 04:22:08.500
limit within the limits of what's physically possible, but we're nowhere near the limit

04:22:09.460 --> 04:22:20.020
on abundance. Forget about going to Mars, on this one rock. We could make this place incredibly

04:22:20.020 --> 04:22:36.500
beautiful and stable if we just did enough work to solve some rather longstanding political problems.

04:22:36.580 --> 04:22:41.940
The problem of incentives. To you, the basic characteristics of human nature are such that

04:22:42.500 --> 04:22:47.300
we'll be okay if the incentives are okay. We'll do pretty good.

04:22:48.260 --> 04:22:52.420
I'm worried about the asymmetries that it's easier to break things than to fix them. It's easier to

04:22:55.460 --> 04:23:03.460
light a fire than to put it out. I do worry that as technology gets more and more powerful,

04:23:03.460 --> 04:23:09.940
it becomes easier for the minority who wants to screw things up to effectively screw things up

04:23:09.940 --> 04:23:19.780
for everybody. A thousand years ago, it was simply impossible for one person to derange the lives of

04:23:20.340 --> 04:23:27.220
millions, much less billions. Now that's getting to be possible. On the assumption that we're

04:23:27.220 --> 04:23:36.900
always going to have a sufficient number of crazy individuals or malevolent individuals,

04:23:39.780 --> 04:23:46.500
we have to figure out that asymmetry somehow. There's some cautious exploration of emergent

04:23:46.500 --> 04:23:53.940
technology that we need to get our heads screwed on straight about. So gain-of-function research.

04:23:54.260 --> 04:24:01.220
How much do we want to democratize all the relevant technologies there? You really want

04:24:01.220 --> 04:24:08.340
to give everyone the ability to order nucleotides in the mail and give them the blueprints for

04:24:08.340 --> 04:24:14.180
viruses online because you're a free speech absolutist and you think all PDFs need to be

04:24:14.180 --> 04:24:27.380
exportable everywhere. Many people are confused about my take on free speech because I've come

04:24:27.380 --> 04:24:35.780
down on the unpopular side of some of these questions. My overriding concern is that in

04:24:35.780 --> 04:24:41.780
many cases, I'm worried about the free speech of individual businesses or individual platforms or

04:24:41.780 --> 04:24:47.300
individual media people to decide that they don't want to be associated with certain things.

04:24:48.180 --> 04:24:52.820
If you own Twitter, I think you should be able to kick off the Nazi you don't want to be associated

04:24:52.820 --> 04:24:59.060
with because it's your platform, you own it. That's your free speech. That's the side of my

04:24:59.060 --> 04:25:05.860
free speech concern for Twitter. It's not that every Nazi has the right to algorithmic speech

04:25:05.860 --> 04:25:11.700
on Twitter. I think if you own Twitter, whether it's just Elon or in the world where it was

04:25:11.700 --> 04:25:16.980
in Elon, just the people who own Twitter and the board and the shareholders and the employees,

04:25:18.020 --> 04:25:24.100
these people should be free to decide what they want to promote or not. I view them as publishers

04:25:25.220 --> 04:25:33.300
more than as platforms in the end and that has other implications. But I do worry about

04:25:33.300 --> 04:25:40.500
this problem of misinformation and algorithmically and otherwise supercharged misinformation.

04:25:41.700 --> 04:25:50.980
And I do think we're at a bottleneck now. I guess it could be the hubris of every present

04:25:50.980 --> 04:25:56.260
generation to think that their moment is especially important. But I do think with

04:25:57.060 --> 04:26:01.860
the emergence of these technologies, we're some kind of bottleneck where we really have to

04:26:02.420 --> 04:26:07.220
figure out how to get this right. And if we do get this right, if we figure out how to not drive

04:26:07.220 --> 04:26:13.300
ourselves crazy by giving people access to all possible information and misinformation at all

04:26:13.300 --> 04:26:22.820
times, I think, yeah, there's no limit to how happily we could collaborate with billions of

04:26:22.820 --> 04:26:30.020
creative, fulfilled people. It's just- And trillions of robots, some of them sex

04:26:30.020 --> 04:26:34.100
robots, but that's another topic. Robots that are running the right algorithm,

04:26:34.100 --> 04:26:37.780
whatever that algorithm is. Whatever you need in your life to make you happy.

04:26:40.260 --> 04:26:44.340
The first time we talked is one of the huge honors of my life. I've been a fan of yours

04:26:44.340 --> 04:26:50.580
for a long time. The few times you were respectful but critical to me means the world. And thank you

04:26:50.580 --> 04:26:56.660
so much for helping me and caring enough and caring enough about the world and for everything

04:26:56.660 --> 04:27:02.820
you do. But I should say that the few of us that try to put love in the world on Twitter miss you

04:27:02.820 --> 04:27:10.740
on Twitter. Well, enjoy yourselves. Don't break anything, kids. Have a good party without me.

04:27:10.740 --> 04:27:13.860
Thanks so much. I'm very happy to do this. Thanks for the invitation.

04:27:13.860 --> 04:27:14.900
Thank you. Great to see you again.

04:27:15.860 --> 04:27:19.860
