In terms of your mistakes, society tells you don't make them, because we will judge you,

00:06.000 --> 00:10.960
and we will look down on you. And I think the really successful people realize that actually

00:10.960 --> 00:17.520
know it's the cycle time of mistakes that gets you to success. Because your error rate will

00:17.520 --> 00:22.880
diminish the more mistakes that you make, you observe them, you figure out where it's coming

00:22.880 --> 00:27.440
from. Is it a psychological thing? Is it a, you know, cognitive thing? And then you fix it.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.680
The following is a conversation with Chamath Palahapitiya, a venture capitalist and engineer,

00:35.680 --> 00:43.520
founder and CEO of Social Capital, previously an early senior executive at Facebook, and is the

00:43.520 --> 00:50.960
co-host of the All In Podcast, a podcast that I highly recommend for the wisdom and the camaraderie

00:50.960 --> 00:58.400
of the four co-hosts, also known as besties. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it,

00:58.400 --> 01:04.560
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Chamath Palahapitiya.

01:05.680 --> 01:11.600
You grew up in a dysfunctional household on welfare. You've talked about this before. What

01:11.600 --> 01:15.600
were for you personally, psychologically, some difficult moments in your childhood?

01:16.480 --> 01:21.520
I'll answer that question in a slightly different way, which is that I think when you grow up

01:22.480 --> 01:28.480
in a household that's defined by physical abuse and psychological abuse,

01:29.760 --> 01:35.760
you're hypervigilant all the time. And so it's actually easier for me to point to moments where

01:36.800 --> 01:43.120
I was happy or I felt compassion or I felt safe. Otherwise, every moment,

01:43.120 --> 01:47.520
I'll give you a couple of examples. Like, you know, I was thinking about this a while ago.

01:47.520 --> 01:53.360
There was a tree outside of my apartment where we lived when I was growing up,

01:54.960 --> 02:01.680
and my father sometimes would make me go outside to take the tree branch that he would hit me with.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.480
And so you can imagine if you're a 10, 11-year-old kid and you have to deal with that,

02:06.480 --> 02:13.120
what do you do? Well, a hypervigilant child learns how to basically estimate the strength

02:13.120 --> 02:22.720
of these branches. How far can he go before it breaks? You have to estimate his anger

02:22.720 --> 02:28.960
and estimate the effective strength of branches and bring back something because I remember these

02:28.960 --> 02:33.600
moments where if it was, he would look at it and then he would make me go out again and get it,

02:33.600 --> 02:42.000
get a different one. Or there was a certain belt that he wore that had this kind of belt buckle

02:42.000 --> 02:48.480
that stuck out. And you just wanted to make sure that if that was the thing that you were going to

02:48.480 --> 02:55.440
get hit by, that it wasn't the buckle facing out because that really hurt. And so you became hyper

02:55.440 --> 03:01.920
aware of which part of the buckle was facing out versus facing in in those moments. And there are

03:01.920 --> 03:07.280
like hundreds of these little examples, which essentially I would say the through line is that

03:07.280 --> 03:13.040
you're just so on edge, right? And you walk into this house and you're just basically trying to

03:13.040 --> 03:20.160
get to the point where you leave the house. And so in that microcosm of growing up,

03:21.120 --> 03:26.480
any moment that's not like that is seared in my memory in a way that I just can't

03:27.760 --> 03:34.000
describe to a person. I'll give you an example. I volunteered when I was in grade five or six,

03:34.000 --> 03:40.080
I can't remember which it was, in the kindergarten of my school. And I would just go and the teacher

03:40.080 --> 03:48.000
would ask you to clean things up. And at the end of that grade five year, she took me and two other

03:48.000 --> 03:56.880
kids to Dairy Queen. And I'd never gone to a restaurant, literally, because we didn't have

03:56.880 --> 04:02.960
the money. And I remember the first time I tasted this Dairy Queen meal, it was like a hamburger,

04:02.960 --> 04:11.760
fries, a Coke and a blizzard. And I was like, what is this? And I felt so special, you know,

04:11.760 --> 04:16.400
because you're getting something that most people would take for granted. Oh, it's a Sunday or it's

04:16.400 --> 04:21.920
you know, or I'm really busy. Let me go take my kid to to fast food. I think that, you know, until

04:21.920 --> 04:28.880
I left high school, I think and this is not just specific to me, but a lot of other people, it's

04:28.880 --> 04:37.120
you're in this hypervigilant loop punctuated with these incredibly visceral moments of compassion

04:37.120 --> 04:45.680
by other people. You know, a different example, we had such a strict budget and we didn't have a car.

04:46.880 --> 04:52.560
And so, you know, I was responsible with my mom to always go shopping. And so I learned very early

04:52.560 --> 04:57.920
on how to, you know, look for coupons, how to buy things that were on sale or special.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.720
And we had a very basic diet because you have to budget this thing really precisely.

05:03.840 --> 05:10.720
But the end of every year where I lived, there was a large grocery chain called Loblaws.

05:11.680 --> 05:19.280
And Loblaws would discount a cheesecake from $7.99 to $4.99.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.800
And my parents would buy that once a year. And we probably did that six or seven times.

05:27.920 --> 05:33.760
And you can't imagine how special we felt. Myself, my two sisters, we would sit there,

05:33.760 --> 05:38.000
we would watch the, you know, the New Year's Eve celebration on TV. We would

05:38.000 --> 05:42.400
cut this cheesecake into, you know, five pieces. It felt like everything.

05:44.320 --> 05:50.720
So that's sort of how, you know, my existence when I was at that age is,

05:51.440 --> 05:53.520
for better or for worse, that's how I remember it.

05:54.240 --> 05:59.600
The hypervigilance loop, is that still with you today? What are the echoes of that that's

05:59.600 --> 06:02.800
still with you today, the good and the bad? If you put yourself

06:02.800 --> 06:18.000
in the mind of a young child, the thing that that does to you is at a very core basic level,

06:18.000 --> 06:24.720
it says you're worthless, right? Because if you can step outside of that and you think about any

06:24.720 --> 06:31.360
child in the world, they don't deserve to go through that. And at some point, by the way,

06:31.360 --> 06:35.520
I should tell you, like, I don't blame my parents anymore. It was a process to get there,

06:35.520 --> 06:42.240
but I feel like they did the best they could. And they suffered their own issues and enormous

06:42.240 --> 06:48.480
pressures and stresses. And so, you know, I've really, for the most part, forgiven them.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.920
How did you, sorry to interrupt, let go of that blame?

06:53.120 --> 06:59.200
That was a really long process where, for I would say the first 35 years of my life,

07:00.160 --> 07:08.480
I compartmentalized and I avoided all of those memories. And I sought external validation,

07:09.440 --> 07:13.600
right? Going back to this self-worth idea, if you're taught as a child that you're worthless,

07:13.600 --> 07:17.840
because why would somebody do these things to you? It's not because you're worth something,

07:17.840 --> 07:24.000
you think to yourself very viscerally, you're worth nothing. And so then you go out and you seek

07:24.000 --> 07:28.800
external validation. Maybe you try to go and get into a great college, you try to get a good job.

07:29.360 --> 07:35.680
You try to make a lot of money. You try to demonstrate in superficial ways with the car

07:35.680 --> 07:42.080
you drive or the clothes you wear, that you deserve people to care about you, to try to make up for

07:42.080 --> 07:48.640
that really deep hole. But at some point, it doesn't get filled in. And so you have a choice.

07:49.520 --> 07:54.160
And so for me, what happened was in the course of a six-month period, I lost my best friend

07:54.160 --> 08:02.080
and I lost my father. And it was really like the dam broke loose because the compartmentalization

08:02.080 --> 08:07.360
stopped working because the reminder of why I was compartmentalizing was gone.

08:08.720 --> 08:13.840
And so I had to go through this period of disharmony to really understand

08:13.840 --> 08:23.520
and steal man his perspective. And can you imagine trying to do that, to go through all

08:23.520 --> 08:30.000
of the things where you have to now look at it from his perspective and find compassion and empathy

08:30.800 --> 08:36.400
for what he went through? And then I shift the focus to my mom and I said,

08:36.960 --> 08:41.920
well, you were not the victim actually, you were somewhat complicit as well because

08:41.920 --> 08:45.200
you were of sound mind and body and you were in the room when it happened.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.240
So then I had to go through that process with her and steal man her perspective.

08:51.680 --> 08:56.720
At the end of it, I never justified what they did, but I've been able to forgive what they did.

08:58.080 --> 09:03.920
I think they did the best they could. And at the end of the day, they did the most important thing,

09:03.920 --> 09:10.160
which is they gave me and my sisters a shot by emigrating, by giving up everything,

09:10.160 --> 09:17.280
by staying in Canada and doing whatever it took between the two of them to sort of claw and scrape

09:17.280 --> 09:23.120
together enough money to live so that my sisters and I could have a shot. And I'm very thankful for

09:23.120 --> 09:28.800
them. Could they have done better? Obviously, but I'm okay with what has taken place. But it's been

09:28.800 --> 09:34.720
a long process of that steal manning so that you can develop some empathy and compassion and forgive.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.200
Do you think if you talk to your dad,

09:39.680 --> 09:43.680
shortly after he died and you went through that process or today, you'll be able to

09:44.400 --> 09:48.160
have the same strength to forgive him?

09:51.920 --> 09:58.160
I think it would be a very complicated journey. I think I've learned to be incredibly

09:59.120 --> 10:04.480
open about what has happened and all of the mistakes I've made.

10:06.560 --> 10:13.120
I think it would require him to be pretty radically honest about confirming

10:14.400 --> 10:19.440
what I think he went through, because otherwise it just wouldn't work. Otherwise, I would say,

10:19.440 --> 10:25.360
let's keep things where they are, which is I did the work with people that have helped me,

10:25.360 --> 10:32.000
obviously. But it's better for him to just kind of hopefully he's looking from some place and he's

10:32.000 --> 10:38.240
thinking it was worth it. I think he deserves to think that all of this. Because I think the

10:38.240 --> 10:43.440
immigrant challenge, or not even the immigrant challenge, the lower middle class challenge,

10:43.440 --> 10:47.920
anybody who really wants better for their kids and doesn't have a good toolkit to give it to them,

10:48.320 --> 10:56.160
some of them just they choke up on the bat. They just get so agitated about this idea that all this

10:56.160 --> 11:02.560
sacrifice will not be worth it, that it spills out in really unproductive ways. And I would put him

11:02.560 --> 11:10.080
in that category. And their self-evaluation, introspection, they have tunnel vision, so they're

11:10.800 --> 11:19.520
not able to often see the damage they did. I know, like yourself, a few successful people that

11:20.160 --> 11:26.080
had very difficult relationships with their dad. And when you take the perspective of the dad,

11:27.040 --> 11:31.840
they're completely in denial about any of it. So if you actually have a conversation,

11:31.840 --> 11:38.160
there would not be a deep honesty there. And I think that's maybe in part the way of life.

11:39.120 --> 11:48.640
Yeah. And I remember pretty distinctly after I left and in my middle 30s, where by all measure,

11:48.640 --> 11:55.440
I had roughly become reasonably successful. And my dad didn't particularly care about that,

11:55.440 --> 12:02.400
which was so odd because I had to confront the fact that whether it was a title or money or

12:02.400 --> 12:07.040
press clippings, he never really cared. He moved on to a different set of goals,

12:07.120 --> 12:14.080
which was more about my character and being a good person to my family and really preparing

12:14.080 --> 12:21.200
me to lead our family when he wasn't there. And that bothered me because I thought I got

12:21.200 --> 12:27.120
to the finish line and I thought there was going to be a medal, meaning like, I can tell you, Lex,

12:27.120 --> 12:33.120
he never told me that he loved me. I'm not sure if that's normal or not. It was my normality.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.960
And I thought there's going to be something, some gold star, which never appeared.

12:38.640 --> 12:42.960
And so that's like a hard thing to kind of confront because you're like, well,

12:42.960 --> 12:50.000
now what is this? What is this all about? Was this all just kind of a ruse? But then I realized,

12:50.000 --> 12:56.480
well, hold on a second. There were these moments where in his way, again, putting yourself in his

12:56.480 --> 13:02.720
shoes, I think he was trying to say he was sorry. He would hold my hand, you know, and he would

13:02.720 --> 13:06.640
interlock the fingers, which I felt is that's a really intimate way of holding somebody's hand,

13:06.640 --> 13:12.480
I think. So I remember those things. So, you know, these are the things that are just etched in,

13:12.480 --> 13:19.600
at least in my mind. And at the end of it, you know, I think I've done a decent job in

13:19.600 --> 13:23.840
repairing my relationship with him, even though, you know, it was posthumous.

13:24.480 --> 13:30.720
It does make me wonder in which way you and I, we might be broken and not see it,

13:31.280 --> 13:35.120
and might be hurting others and not see it. Well, I think that when you

13:35.920 --> 13:39.360
grew up in those kinds of environments, and they're all different kinds of this kind of

13:39.360 --> 13:47.360
dysfunction. But if what you get from that is that you're not worthwhile, you're not you're less than

13:47.440 --> 13:54.720
many, many other people. When you enter adulthood, or, you know, semi adulthood in your early 20s,

13:55.680 --> 14:02.080
you will be in a cycle where you are hurting other people. You may not know it. Hopefully,

14:02.080 --> 14:06.400
you find somebody who holds you accountable and tells you and loves you enough through that.

14:08.160 --> 14:12.720
But you are going to take all of that disharmony in your childhood and you're going to inject that

14:12.720 --> 14:17.840
disharmony into whether it's your professional relationships, or your personal relationships,

14:17.840 --> 14:23.280
or both, until you get to some form of rock bottom and you start to repair.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.840
And I think there's a lot of people that resonate with that because they have each suffered their

14:29.840 --> 14:36.880
own things that at some point in their lives have told them that they're less than. And then they

14:36.880 --> 14:44.640
go and cope. And when you cope, eventually those coping mechanisms escalate. And at some point,

14:44.640 --> 14:48.880
it'll be unhealthy, either for you, but oftentimes it's for the people around you.

14:49.760 --> 14:58.000
Well, from those humble beginnings, you are now a billionaire. How has money changed your life,

14:58.000 --> 15:04.560
or maybe the landscape of experience in your life? Does it buy happiness?

15:05.200 --> 15:12.240
It doesn't buy happiness, but it buys you a level of comfort for you to really amplify what

15:12.240 --> 15:18.320
happiness is. I kind of think about it in the following way. Let's just say that there's a

15:18.320 --> 15:25.600
hundred things on a table. And the table says, find happiness here. And there are different prices.

15:27.760 --> 15:33.120
The way that the world works is that many of these experiences are cordoned off,

15:33.120 --> 15:40.720
a little bit behind a velvet rope, where you think that there's more happiness as the prices

15:40.720 --> 15:45.520
of things escalate. If you live in an apartment, you admire the person with the house.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.960
If you live in a house, you admire the person with the bigger house.

15:50.400 --> 15:59.520
That person admires the person with an island. Some person drives their car, admires the person

15:59.520 --> 16:03.360
who flies, who admires the person who flies business class, who admires the person who flies

16:03.360 --> 16:10.960
first to private. There's all of these escalations on this table. And most people get to the first

16:10.960 --> 16:19.200
five or six. And so they just naturally assume that items seven through a hundred is really

16:19.200 --> 16:26.800
where happiness is found. And just to tell you the finish line, I've tried a hundred and back,

16:26.800 --> 16:35.280
and I've tried two more hundred to it. And happiness isn't there. But it does give you

16:35.280 --> 16:39.920
a level of comfort. I read a study, and I don't know if it's true or not, but it said that

16:41.120 --> 16:48.960
the absolute maximal link between money and happiness is around $50 million.

16:51.280 --> 16:56.480
And it was just a social studies kind of thing that I think one of the Ivy Leagues put out.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.920
And underneath it, the way that they explained it was because you could have a home,

16:59.920 --> 17:04.080
you could have all kinds of the creature comforts, you could take care of your family.

17:05.280 --> 17:11.120
And then you were left to ponder what it is that you really want. I think the challenge for most

17:11.120 --> 17:18.720
people is to realize that this escalating arms race of more things will solve your problems

17:19.440 --> 17:26.800
is not true. More and better is not the solution. It's this idea that

17:28.800 --> 17:35.200
you are on a very precise journey that's unique to yourself. You are playing a game

17:36.080 --> 17:40.240
of which only you are the player. Everybody else is an interloper,

17:41.840 --> 17:47.440
and you have a responsibility to design the gameplay. And I think a lot of people don't

17:47.440 --> 17:51.840
realize that, because if they did, I think they would make a lot of different decisions about how

17:51.840 --> 17:59.120
they live their life. And I still do the same thing. I mean revert to basically running around

17:59.120 --> 18:06.080
asking other people, what will make you like me more? What will make me more popular in your eyes?

18:06.080 --> 18:12.480
And I try to do it, and it never works. It is just a complete dead end.

18:12.880 --> 18:19.280
Is there negative aspects to money? Like, for example, it becoming harder to find people you

18:19.280 --> 18:26.240
can trust. I think the most negative aspect is that it amplifies a 360 degree view of your

18:26.240 --> 18:34.480
personality. Because there are a lot of people and society tells you that more money is actually

18:34.480 --> 18:40.080
better. You are a better person somehow. And you're factually more worthwhile than some other people

18:40.080 --> 18:46.160
that have less money. That's also a lie. But when you're given that kind of attention,

18:46.160 --> 18:52.080
it's very easy for you to become a caricature of yourself. That's probably the single worst

18:52.080 --> 18:56.560
thing that happens to you. But I say it in the opposite way. I think all I've ever seen

18:56.560 --> 19:03.360
in Silicon Valley as an example is that when somebody gets a hold of a lot of money,

19:03.360 --> 19:08.480
it tends to cause them to become exactly who they were meant to be. They're either a kind person,

19:08.480 --> 19:15.040
they're either a curious person, they're either a jerk, they're either cheap. They can use all

19:15.040 --> 19:20.400
kinds of masks, but now that there's no expectations and society gives you a get out of jail free card,

19:20.400 --> 19:23.760
you start to behave the way that's most comfortable to you. So you see somebody's

19:23.760 --> 19:29.040
innate personality. That's a really interesting thing to observe because then you can very quickly

19:29.040 --> 19:34.560
bucket sort where do you want to spend time and who is really additive to your gameplay

19:34.560 --> 19:38.160
and who is really a negative detractor to your gameplay.

19:38.160 --> 19:45.840
You're an investor, but you're also a kind of philosopher. You analyze the world in all

19:45.840 --> 19:53.600
these different perspectives on all in podcasts, on Twitter, everywhere. Do you worry that money

19:55.120 --> 20:03.280
puts you out of touch from being able to truly empathize with the experience of the general

20:03.280 --> 20:08.320
population, which in part, first of all, on a human level that could be limiting,

20:08.320 --> 20:12.080
but also as an analyst of human civilization that could be limiting?

20:13.600 --> 20:18.960
I think it definitely can for a lot of people because it's an abstraction for you to stop caring.

20:20.560 --> 20:27.600
I also think the other thing is that you can very quickly, especially in today's world,

20:28.320 --> 20:33.440
become the scapegoat. Just to use a Gerardian, like René Gerard, if you think about mimetic

20:33.440 --> 20:40.880
theory in a nutshell, we're all competing for these very scarce resources that we are told

20:40.880 --> 20:47.920
is worthwhile. If you view the world through that Gerardian lens, what are we really doing?

20:47.920 --> 20:53.760
We are all fighting for scarce resources, whether that's Twitter followers, money,

20:53.760 --> 20:58.880
acclaim, notoriety, and we all compete with each other. In that competition,

21:00.560 --> 21:06.640
Gerard writes, the only way you escape that loop is by scapegoating something or somebody.

21:07.920 --> 21:12.560
I think we are in that loop right now where just the fact of being successful

21:12.560 --> 21:18.560
is a thing that one should scapegoat to end all of this tension that we have in the world.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.840
I think that it's a little misguided because I don't think it solves the fundamental problem.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.680
We can talk about what the solution to some of these problems are, but

21:29.200 --> 21:35.120
that's, I think, the loop that we're all living. If you become a caricature and you feed yourself

21:35.120 --> 21:41.680
into it, you're not doing anything to really advance things. Your nickname is The Dictator.

21:41.680 --> 21:45.920
How did you get the nickname? We're talking about the corrupting nature of money.

21:45.920 --> 21:52.880
That came from poker. In a poker game, when you sit down, it's chaos, especially in our home game,

21:52.880 --> 21:57.840
there's a ton of big egos, there's people always watching, rail-birding the game,

21:57.840 --> 22:04.640
all kinds of interesting folks. In that, somebody needs to establish hygiene and rules,

22:05.520 --> 22:10.000
and I really care about the integrity of the game. It would just require somebody to just say,

22:10.000 --> 22:16.800
okay, enough. Then people were just like, okay, stop dictating. That's where that came from.

22:16.800 --> 22:22.320
So who to you, speaking of which, is the greatest poker player of all time, and why is it Phil

22:22.320 --> 22:28.000
Helmuth? Exactly. Helmuth probably knew this question was coming. Here's what I'll say. I

22:28.000 --> 22:34.240
think Helmuth is the antidote to computers more than any other player playing today.

22:35.040 --> 22:42.720
And when you see him in a heads-up situation, so I think he's played 9 or 10 heads-up tournaments

22:42.720 --> 22:49.280
in a row, and he's played basically 10 of the top 20 people so far, and he's beaten all but one of

22:49.280 --> 23:02.640
them. When you're playing heads-up, 1 v 1, that is the most GTO understandable spot, meaning game

23:02.640 --> 23:08.240
theory optimal position. That's where computers can give you an enormous edge. The minute you add

23:08.240 --> 23:15.120
even a third player, the value of computers and the value of their recommendations basically falls

23:15.120 --> 23:20.960
off a cliff. So one way to think about it is Helmuth is forced to play against people that

23:20.960 --> 23:28.320
are essentially trained like AIs. And so to be able to beat 8 out of 9 of them means that you

23:28.320 --> 23:34.880
are playing so orthogonally to what is considered game theory optimal, and you're overlaying human

23:34.880 --> 23:40.160
reasoning. The judgment to say, well, in this spot, I should do X, but I'm going to do Y.

23:40.160 --> 23:45.680
It's not dissimilar in chess like what makes Magnus Carlsen so good. Sometimes he takes these

23:45.680 --> 23:52.320
weird lines. He'll sacrifice positions. He'll overplay certain positions or certain bishops

23:52.320 --> 23:57.520
versus knights and all of these spots that are very confusing. And what it does is it throws

23:57.520 --> 24:01.600
people off their game. I think he just won a recent online tournament, and it's like by move 6,

24:02.880 --> 24:09.680
there is no GTO move for his opponent to make because it's out of the rule book. Maybe he read

24:09.680 --> 24:14.160
some game. I read the quote. It was like, he probably read some game in some bar in Russia

24:14.160 --> 24:20.160
in 1954, memorized it, and all of a sudden by 6 moves in, the computer AI is worthless.

24:20.160 --> 24:28.240
So that's what makes Helmuth great. There is one person that I think is superior,

24:30.160 --> 24:33.920
and I think it's what Daniel also said, and I would echo that because I played Phil as well,

24:33.920 --> 24:48.400
but Phil Ivey is the most well-rounded, cold-blooded, bloodthirsty animal. He sees

24:48.400 --> 24:52.560
into your soul, Lex, in a way where you're just like, oh my God, stop looking at me.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.480
Have you ever played him?

24:54.480 --> 24:59.280
Yeah. Yeah, we've played. We've played, and he crushes the games. Crushes the games.

24:59.280 --> 25:06.240
So what does feeling crushed mean and feel like in poker? Is it like that you just can't read at

25:06.240 --> 25:11.840
all, you're being constantly pressured, you feel off balance, you try to bluff, and the person

25:11.840 --> 25:16.720
reads you perfectly, that kind of stuff? This is a really, really excellent question

25:16.720 --> 25:21.600
because I think this has parallels to a bunch of other things. Okay, let's just use poker as a

25:21.600 --> 25:30.480
microcosm to explain a bunch of other systems or games. Maybe it's running a company or investing,

25:30.480 --> 25:35.280
okay? So let's use those three examples, but we use poker to explain it. What does success look

25:35.280 --> 25:41.360
like? Well, success looks like you have positive expected value, right? In poker, the simple way

25:41.360 --> 25:47.280
to summarize that is your opponent, let's just say you and I are playing, are going to make a

25:47.280 --> 25:52.160
bunch of mistakes. There's a bunch of it that's going to be absolutely perfect, and then there's

25:52.160 --> 25:57.440
a few spots where you make mistakes. And then there's a bunch of places in the poker game where

25:57.440 --> 26:06.800
I play perfectly, and I make a few mistakes. Basically, your mistakes minus my mistakes is

26:06.800 --> 26:13.920
the edge, right? That's how poker works. If I make fewer mistakes than you make,

26:13.920 --> 26:18.320
I will make money and I will win. That is the objective of the game. Translate that into

26:18.320 --> 26:24.560
business. You're running a company, you have a team of employees, you have a pool of human capital

26:24.560 --> 26:30.880
that's capable of being productive in the world and creating something, but you are going to make

26:30.880 --> 26:38.000
mistakes in making that. Maybe it doesn't completely fit the market. Maybe it's mispriced.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.480
Maybe it actually doesn't require all of the people that you need so the margins are wrong.

26:43.600 --> 26:48.000
And then there's the competitive set of all the other alternatives that customer has.

26:49.440 --> 26:55.840
Their mistakes minus your mistakes is the expected value of Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.

26:56.480 --> 27:02.720
Okay, now take investing. Every time you buy something, somebody else on the other side is

27:02.720 --> 27:10.880
selling it to you. Is that their mistake? We don't know yet. But their mistakes minus your mistakes

27:12.000 --> 27:15.200
is how you make a lot of money over long periods of time as an investor.

27:16.080 --> 27:19.760
Somebody sold you Google at $40 a share. You bought it and you kept it.

27:20.720 --> 27:26.400
Huge mistake on their part. Minimum mistakes on your part. The difference of that is the money

27:26.400 --> 27:31.520
that you made. So life can be summarized in many ways in that way. So the question is,

27:32.400 --> 27:37.680
what can you do about other people's mistakes? And the answer is nothing. That is somebody else's

27:37.680 --> 27:43.440
game. You can try to influence them. You could try to subvert them. Maybe you plant a spy inside

27:43.440 --> 27:48.240
of that other person's company to sabotage them. I guess there are things at the edges that you can

27:48.320 --> 27:54.800
do. But my firm belief is that life success really boils down to how do you control

27:55.760 --> 28:01.760
your mistakes? Now this is a bit counterintuitive. The way you control your mistakes is by making a

28:01.760 --> 28:10.240
lot of mistakes. So taking risks is somehow a way to minimize the number of mistakes.

28:10.240 --> 28:15.520
Let's just say you want to find love. You want to find somebody deeply connected with.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.040
Yeah. Do you do that by not going out on dates?

28:21.040 --> 28:23.600
Yes. Sorry. Sorry.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.760
You're the only person that thinks that's the answer to that question.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.040
No, I'm joking. I'm joking.

28:27.040 --> 28:31.040
No, but you know what I mean? You have to date people. You have to open yourself up. You have

28:31.040 --> 28:38.160
to be authentic. You give yourself a chance to get hurt. But you're a good person. So you know

28:38.160 --> 28:43.840
what happens when you get hurt? That is actually their mistake. And if you are inauthentic,

28:43.840 --> 28:48.880
that's your mistake. That's a controllable thing in you. You can tell them the truth,

28:48.880 --> 28:55.440
who you are, and say here's my pluses and minuses. My point is there are very few things in life

28:56.240 --> 29:03.840
that you can't break down, I think, into that very simple idea. And in terms of your mistakes,

29:03.840 --> 29:09.120
society tells you don't make them because we will judge you and we will look down on you.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.040
And I think the really successful people realize that actually know

29:13.840 --> 29:20.320
it's the cycle time of mistakes that gets you to success. Because your error rate will diminish

29:20.320 --> 29:25.040
the more mistakes that you make, you observe them, you figure out where it's coming from.

29:25.040 --> 29:29.360
Is it a psychological thing? Is it a cognitive thing? And then you fix it.

29:30.000 --> 29:38.000
So the implied thing there is that there's in business and investing in poker and dating

29:38.000 --> 29:44.160
in life is that there's this platonic GTO game theory optimal thing out there.

29:44.160 --> 29:48.800
And so when you say mistakes, you're always comparing to that optimal path you could have

29:48.800 --> 29:54.480
taken. I think slightly different. I would say mistake is maybe a bad proxy, but it's the best

29:54.480 --> 30:00.720
proxy I have for learning. But I'm using the language of what society tells you. Sure.

30:00.720 --> 30:05.600
Got it. Society tells you that when you try something and it doesn't work, it's a mistake.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.680
So I just use that word because it's the word that resonates most with most people.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.720
Got it. The real thing that it is, is learning.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.880
Yeah. It's like in neural networks, it's lost.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.640
It's a neural network, it's lost. Exactly.

30:17.520 --> 30:22.080
Yeah. All right. So you're using the mistake that is most, the word that is most understandable,

30:22.640 --> 30:28.480
especially by the way people experience it. I guess most of life is a sequence of mistakes.

30:28.480 --> 30:33.600
The problem is when you use the word mistake and you think about mistakes, it actually has a

30:34.000 --> 30:40.800
counterproductive effect of you becoming conservative and just being risk averse.

30:41.600 --> 30:49.920
So if you flip it and say, try to maximize the number of successes, somehow that leads you to

30:49.920 --> 30:57.920
take more risk. Mistake scares people. I think mistakes scare people because

30:58.560 --> 31:05.280
society likes these very simplified boundaries of who is winning and who is losing,

31:06.080 --> 31:13.200
and they want to reward people who make traditional choices and succeed.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.240
But the thing is, what's so

31:19.200 --> 31:25.760
corrosive about that is that they're actually not even being put in a position to actually

31:25.760 --> 31:31.200
make a quote unquote mistake and fail. So if you look at getting into an elite school,

31:32.640 --> 31:37.840
society rewards you for being in the Ivy Leagues in a way that, in my opinion,

31:37.840 --> 31:41.360
incorrectly, doesn't reward you for being in a non-Ivy League school.

31:42.240 --> 31:47.280
There's a certain level of status and presumption of intellect and capability that comes with being

31:47.280 --> 31:54.480
there. But that system doesn't really have a counterfactual because it's not as if you both

31:54.480 --> 32:00.800
go to MIT and Ohio State. Then we can see two versions of Lex Fridman so that we can figure

32:00.800 --> 32:08.560
out that the jig is up and there is no difference. Instead, it reinforces this idea that there is no

32:09.280 --> 32:12.800
truth-seeking function. There is no way to actually make this thing whole.

32:14.560 --> 32:18.960
It tells you, you have to get in here, and if you don't, your life is over. You've made a huge

32:18.960 --> 32:26.080
mistake or you've failed completely. And so you have to find different unique ways of dismantling

32:26.080 --> 32:34.480
this. This is why part of what I realized where I got very lucky is I had no friends in high school.

32:35.280 --> 32:41.120
I had a few cohort of acquaintances. But part of being so hypervigilant when I grew up

32:41.680 --> 32:48.720
was I was so ashamed of that world that I had to live in, I didn't want to bring anyone into it.

32:48.720 --> 32:56.400
I could not see myself that anybody would accept me. But the thing with that is that I had no

32:56.400 --> 33:02.400
definition of what expectations should be. So they were not guided by the people around me.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.080
And so I would escape to define my expectations.

33:06.080 --> 33:13.600
That's interesting. But you didn't feel like your dad didn't put you in a prison of expectation?

33:14.480 --> 33:20.320
Because if you don't have a friend, so the flip side of that, you don't have any other signals.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.720
It's very easy to believe when you're in a cult.

33:23.840 --> 33:32.960
Well, he was angry. He pushed me. He used me as a mechanism to alleviate his own frustration.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.560
And this may sound very crazy, but he also believed in me.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.560
And so that's what created this weird duality where I was always confused.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.720
You could be somebody great. He believed that you could be somebody truly special.

33:46.720 --> 33:51.360
He did. I didn't believe him because I couldn't reconcile

33:51.360 --> 33:58.720
them the other half of the day, those behaviors. But what it allowed me to do was I escaped

33:59.520 --> 34:06.320
in my mind and I found these archetypes around me that were saviors to me.

34:07.280 --> 34:14.160
So I grew up in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I grew up right at the point where the telecom boom was

34:14.160 --> 34:19.680
happening. Companies like Nortel and Newbridge Networks and Mitel, Bell Northern Research,

34:19.680 --> 34:26.080
these were all built in the suburbs of Ottawa. And so there were these larger than life figures,

34:26.080 --> 34:31.440
entrepreneurs, Terry Matthews, Michael Copeland. And so I thought, I'm going to be like them.

34:32.400 --> 34:36.240
I would read Forbes magazine. I would read Fortune magazine. I would look at the rich

34:36.240 --> 34:42.320
people on that list and say, I would be like them, not knowing that maybe that's not who

34:42.320 --> 34:49.760
you wanted it to be. But it was a lifeline. And it kept my mind relatively whole because I could

34:49.760 --> 34:57.120
direct my ambition in a direction. And so why that's so important just circling back to this is

34:57.120 --> 35:00.160
I didn't have a group of friends who were like, I'm going to go to community college.

35:01.440 --> 35:05.200
I didn't have a group of friends that said, well, the goal is just to go to university,

35:05.200 --> 35:11.520
get a simple job, and join the public service, have a good life. And so because I had no

35:11.520 --> 35:16.480
expectations and I was so afraid to venture out of my own house, I never saw what middle-class

35:16.480 --> 35:21.840
life was like. And so I never aspired to it. Now, if I was close to it, I probably would have aspired

35:21.840 --> 35:29.280
to it because my parents in their best year made 32,000 Canadian together. And if you're trying to

35:29.280 --> 35:34.640
raise a family of five people on $32,000, it's a complicated job. And most of the time, they were

35:34.640 --> 35:40.400
probably making 20 something thousand. And I was working since I was 14. So I knew that our station

35:40.400 --> 35:47.120
in life was not the destination. We had to get out. But because I didn't have an obvious place,

35:47.120 --> 35:51.680
it's not like I had a best friend whose house I was going to and I saw some normal functional home.

35:53.280 --> 35:56.800
If I had had that in this weird way, I would have aspired to that.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.520
What was the worst job you had to do?

36:00.160 --> 36:07.600
The best job, but the worst job was I worked at Burger King when I was 14 years old. And I would

36:07.600 --> 36:15.520
do the closing shift. And that was from like 6 p.m. till about 2 in the morning. And in Ontario,

36:15.520 --> 36:20.880
where I lived, Ottawa borders Quebec. In Ontario, the drinking age is 19. You can see where I'm

36:20.880 --> 36:26.320
going with this. The drinking age in Quebec is 18. And that year made all the difference to all

36:26.320 --> 36:31.840
these kids. And so they would go get completely drunk. They would come back. They would come to

36:31.840 --> 36:35.360
the Burger King. You would see all these kids you went to high school with. Can you imagine

36:35.360 --> 36:42.720
how mortifying it is? You're working there in this getup. And they would light that place on fire,

36:43.360 --> 36:49.360
vomit everywhere, puking, pooing, peeing. And when the thing shuts down at one o'clock,

36:49.440 --> 36:57.040
you know, you got to clean that all up. All of it. Changing the garbage, taking it out. It was

36:59.040 --> 37:04.800
a grind. And it really teaches you, okay, I do not want this job.

37:06.800 --> 37:07.760
I don't want it.

37:07.760 --> 37:11.920
But it's funny that that didn't push you towards the stability and the security of the middle class

37:13.040 --> 37:13.680
like life.

37:13.680 --> 37:17.920
I didn't have any good examples of that. I didn't have those around me. I was so ashamed.

37:18.880 --> 37:23.440
I could have never built a relationship where I could have seen those interactions to want that.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.560
And so my desires were framed by these two random rich people that lived in my town who I'd never

37:28.560 --> 37:32.560
met and what I read in magazines about people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.

37:35.440 --> 37:41.680
You were an early senior executive at Facebook during a period of a lot of scaling in the company

37:41.680 --> 37:46.080
history. I mean, it's actually a fascinating period of human history in terms of technology.

37:46.960 --> 37:53.440
Well, in terms of human civilization, honestly. What did you learn from that

37:54.720 --> 37:58.800
time about what it takes to build and scale a successful tech company?

37:58.800 --> 38:03.760
A company that has almost immeasurable impact on the world.

38:06.240 --> 38:11.920
That was an incredible moment in time because everything was so new. To your point, even how

38:11.920 --> 38:16.240
the standards of Web 2.0 at that time were being defined, we were defining them.

38:17.360 --> 38:25.040
I think if you search in the patent library, there's a bunch of these patents that me and

38:25.040 --> 38:31.520
Zach have for random things like cookies or cross-site JavaScript, all these crazy things

38:31.520 --> 38:39.360
that are just these duh kind of ideas in 2023. We had to invent our way around. How do websites

38:39.360 --> 38:43.760
communicate with each other? How do we build in the cloud versus in a data center? How do

38:43.760 --> 38:49.440
we actually have high-performance systems? You mentioned data science, the term and the idea.

38:49.440 --> 38:53.920
We invented this. I invented this thing called data scientist because we had a PhD from Google

38:53.920 --> 39:00.720
that refused to join because he got a job offer that says data analyst. He said call him a

39:00.720 --> 39:04.800
scientist because he was a PhD in particle physics. He was a scientist. I said, great,

39:04.800 --> 39:08.800
you're a scientist here. That launched a discipline. That launched a discipline.

39:08.800 --> 39:17.360
A term arose by any other name. Sometimes words like this can launch entire fields.

39:20.320 --> 39:25.520
I guess at that time you didn't anticipate the impact of machine learning on the entirety of

39:25.520 --> 39:30.640
this whole process because you need machine learning to have both ads and recommender

39:31.200 --> 39:33.760
systems to have the feed for the social networks.

39:33.760 --> 39:38.960
Exactly right. The first real scaled version of machine learning, not AI, but machine learning,

39:38.960 --> 39:42.800
was this thing that Facebook introduced called PYMK, which is people you may know.

39:43.520 --> 39:47.920
The simple idea was that can we initiate a viral mechanic inside the application?

39:48.880 --> 39:56.160
Where you log in, we grab your credentials, we go to your email inbox, we harvest your address book,

39:57.120 --> 40:01.680
we do a compare, we make some guesses, and we start to present to other people that you may

40:01.680 --> 40:06.400
actually know that may not be in your address book. Really simple, a couple joins of some tables,

40:06.400 --> 40:12.400
whatever. It started to just go crazy and the number of people that you were creating this

40:12.400 --> 40:19.360
density and entropy inside this social graph with what was some really simple basic math.

40:20.240 --> 40:25.440
That was eye-opening for us. What it led us down this path of is really understanding

40:25.520 --> 40:31.280
the power of all this machine learning. That infused itself into News Feed and how

40:31.280 --> 40:35.520
the content that you saw could be tailored to who you were and the type of person that you were.

40:36.480 --> 40:42.560
There was a moment in time that all of this stuff was so new. How did you translate the app to

40:42.560 --> 40:45.440
multiple languages? How do you launch the company in all of these countries?

40:46.240 --> 40:53.040
How much of it is just kind of stumbling into things using your best first principles gut

40:53.040 --> 40:59.600
thinking? How much is it like 5, 10, 15, 20-year vision? How much was thinking about the future

41:00.560 --> 41:06.240
of the internet and the metaverse and the humanity and all that kind of stuff?

41:06.240 --> 41:11.040
Because the News Feed sounds trivial, but that changes everything.

41:11.040 --> 41:14.240
Well, you have to remember News Feed

41:14.240 --> 41:21.920
was named and we had this thing where we would just name things what they were.

41:23.040 --> 41:27.920
At the time, all of these other companies, and if you go back into the way back machine,

41:27.920 --> 41:36.320
you can see this, people would invent an MP3 player and they would come up with some crazy name,

41:36.320 --> 41:39.280
or they would invent a software product and come up with a crazy name.

41:40.160 --> 41:46.880
It sounded like the pharma industry. Blokasmab, tag your best friends.

41:47.600 --> 41:52.560
You think, what is this? This makes no sense. This was Zuck's thing. He was like,

41:52.560 --> 41:55.120
well, this is a feed of news, so we're going to call it News Feed.

41:55.920 --> 41:59.200
This is where you tag your photos, so we're going to call that photo tagging.

41:59.680 --> 42:07.440
I mean, literally pretty obvious stuff. The way that those things came about, though,

42:07.440 --> 42:12.320
was very experimentally. This is where I think it's really important for people to understand.

42:12.320 --> 42:20.160
I think Bezos explains this the best. There's a tendency after things work to create a narrative

42:20.160 --> 42:26.720
fallacy because it feeds your ego and you want to have been the person that saw it coming.

42:28.720 --> 42:35.920
I think it's much more honest to say we were very good probabilistic thinkers

42:36.000 --> 42:41.520
that tried to learn as quickly as possible, meaning to make as many mistakes as possible.

42:42.240 --> 42:46.080
I mean, if you look at this very famous placard that Facebook had from back in the day,

42:46.080 --> 42:52.400
what did it say? It said, move fast and break things. In societal language, that's saying

42:52.400 --> 42:56.880
make mistakes as quickly as you can because the minute you break something, you don't do that

42:56.880 --> 43:03.280
by design. It's not a feature. Theoretically, it's a bug, but he understood that and we embraced

43:04.240 --> 43:09.760
that idea. I used to run this meeting once a week where the whole goal was I want to see that

43:09.760 --> 43:15.280
there was a thousand experiments that were run and show me them all from the dumbest to the most

43:15.280 --> 43:21.440
impactful. We would go through that loop and what did it train people? Not that you got celebrated

43:21.440 --> 43:28.720
for the right answer, but you got celebrated for trying. I ran 12 experiments, 12 failed,

43:28.720 --> 43:33.760
and we'd be like, you're the best. Can I just take a small tangent on that?

43:33.760 --> 43:42.240
Move fast and break things has become like a catchphrase of the thing that embodies the

43:42.240 --> 43:49.680
toxic culture of Silicon Valley in today's discourse, which confuses me. Of course,

43:49.680 --> 43:54.720
words and phrases get captured and so on. It becomes very reductive. That's a very

43:54.720 --> 44:00.640
loaded set of words that together can be many years later. People can view very reductive.

44:00.640 --> 44:07.520
Can you steel man each side of that? Pro, move fast and break things, and against.

44:07.520 --> 44:12.800
Yeah, absolutely. I think the pro of move fast and break things is saying the following.

44:13.600 --> 44:18.560
There's a space of things we know and a massive space of things we don't know.

44:19.520 --> 44:25.600
And there's a rate of growth of the things we know, but the rate of growth of the things we

44:25.600 --> 44:32.400
don't know is actually we have to assume growing faster. So the most important thing is to move

44:32.400 --> 44:38.880
into the space of the things we don't know as quickly as possible. And so in order to acquire

44:38.880 --> 44:46.640
knowledge, we're going to assume that the failure mode is the nominal state. And so we just need to

44:46.720 --> 44:51.840
move as quickly as we can, break as many things as possible, which means things are breaking in

44:51.840 --> 44:59.040
code, do the root cause analysis, figure out how to make things better, and then rapidly move into

44:59.040 --> 45:06.080
the space. And he or she who moves fastest into that space will win. It doesn't imply carelessness,

45:06.080 --> 45:15.360
right? It doesn't imply moving fast without also aggressively picking up the lessons from

45:15.360 --> 45:20.080
the mistakes you make. Well, again, that's steelmaning the pro, which is it's a thoughtful

45:23.280 --> 45:30.480
movement around velocity and acquisition of knowledge. Now let's deal with the con case.

45:32.880 --> 45:40.800
When these systems become big enough, there is no more room to experiment in an open-ended way

45:41.440 --> 45:46.480
because the implications have broad societal impacts that are not clear upfront.

45:48.080 --> 45:55.440
So let's take a different, less controversial example. If we said Lipitor worked well for

45:56.080 --> 46:01.280
all people except South Asians, and there's a specific immunoresponse that we can iterate to,

46:02.480 --> 46:06.880
and if we move quickly enough, we can run 10,000 experiments and we think the answer is in that

46:06.880 --> 46:12.880
space. Well, the problem is that those 10,000 experiments may kill 10 million people,

46:14.080 --> 46:21.600
so you have to move methodically. When that drug was experimental and it wasn't being given to

46:21.600 --> 46:26.160
500 million people in the world, moving fast made sense because you could have a pig model,

46:26.160 --> 46:31.120
a mouse model, a monkey model, you could figure out toxicity, but we picked all that low-hanging

46:31.120 --> 46:39.200
fruit. And so now these small iterations have huge impacts that need to be measured and implemented.

46:40.400 --> 46:45.280
Different example is like, you know, if you work at Boeing and you have an implementation that gives

46:45.280 --> 46:52.160
you a 2% efficiency by reshaping the wing or adding winglets, there needs to be a methodical

46:52.160 --> 46:59.440
move slow, be right process because mistakes when they compound, when it's already implemented and

46:59.440 --> 47:04.480
at scale have huge externalities that are impossible to measure until after the fact,

47:04.480 --> 47:11.120
and you see this in the 737 max. So that's how one would steel man the con case, which is that

47:11.120 --> 47:19.840
when an industry becomes critical, you got to slow down. This makes me sad because some industries

47:19.840 --> 47:26.960
like Twitter and Facebook are a good example. They achieve scale very quickly before really

47:26.960 --> 47:35.360
exploring the big area of things to learn. So you basically pick one low-hanging fruit

47:36.240 --> 47:40.320
and that became your huge success. And now you're sitting there with that stupid fruit.

47:40.320 --> 47:48.640
Completely. Well, so as an example, if I was running Facebook for a day,

47:49.600 --> 47:56.160
you know, the big opportunity in my opinion was really not the metaverse, but it was actually

47:56.160 --> 48:04.240
getting the closest that anybody could get to AGI. And if I had to steel man that product case,

48:04.240 --> 48:07.440
here's how I would have pitched it to the board and to Zuck. I would have said, listen,

48:08.080 --> 48:12.960
there are three and a half billion people monthly using this thing. If we think about

48:12.960 --> 48:17.840
human intelligence very reductively, we would say that there is a large portion of it, which

48:17.840 --> 48:24.560
is cognitive, and then there's a large portion of it, which is emotional. We have the best ability

48:24.560 --> 48:30.240
to build a multimodal model that basically takes all of these massive inputs together

48:30.240 --> 48:34.320
to try to intuit how a system would react to all kinds of stimuli.

48:35.920 --> 48:39.840
That to me would have been a profound leap forward for humanity.

48:39.840 --> 48:45.920
Can you dig into that a little bit more? So in terms of, now this is a board meeting,

48:45.920 --> 48:50.960
how would that make Facebook money? I think that you have all of these

48:51.920 --> 49:02.320
systems over time that we don't know could benefit from some layer of reasoning to make it better.

49:04.320 --> 49:10.800
What does Spotify look like when instead of just a very simple recommendation engine,

49:11.440 --> 49:17.360
it actually understands your emotional context and your mood and can move you to a body of music

49:17.360 --> 49:23.680
that you would like? What does it look like if your television, instead of having to go and

49:23.680 --> 49:31.280
channel surf 50,000 shows on a horrible UI, instead just has a sense of what you're into

49:31.280 --> 49:39.440
and shows it to you? What does it mean when you get in your car and it actually drives you to a place

49:39.440 --> 49:44.000
because you should actually eat there even though you don't know it? These are all random things

49:44.000 --> 49:51.200
that make no sense a priori, but it starts to make the person or the provider of that service

49:52.400 --> 49:57.280
the critical reasoning layer for all these everyday products that today would look very

49:57.280 --> 50:01.600
flat without that reasoning. I think you license that and you make a lot of money.

50:01.600 --> 50:07.520
So in many ways, instead of becoming more of the pixels that you see, you become more of the bare

50:07.520 --> 50:13.760
metal that actually creates that experience. And if you look at the companies that are

50:13.760 --> 50:19.280
multi-decade legacy kinds of businesses, the thing that they have done is quietly and

50:19.280 --> 50:25.040
surreptitiously move down the stack. You never move up the stack to survive. You need to move

50:25.040 --> 50:30.240
down the stack. So if you take that OSI reference stack, these layers, how you build an app from the

50:30.240 --> 50:36.640
physical layer to the transport layer all the way up to the app layer, you can map from the 1980s

50:36.640 --> 50:41.120
all the big companies that have been created, right? All the way from Fairchild Semiconductor

50:41.120 --> 50:49.680
and NatSemi to Intel to Cisco to 3Com, Oracle, Netscape at one point, all the way up to the

50:49.680 --> 50:54.160
Googles and the Facebooks of the world. But if you look at where all the lock-in happened,

50:55.520 --> 50:59.680
it's by companies like Apple who used to make software saying, I'm going to get one close.

50:59.680 --> 51:04.640
I'm going to make the bare metal and I'm going to become the platform. Or Google, same thing. I'm

51:04.640 --> 51:09.280
going to create this dominant platform and I'm going to create a substrate that organizes all

51:09.280 --> 51:15.520
this information. That's just omnipresent and everywhere. So the key is if you are lucky enough

51:15.520 --> 51:21.920
to be one of these apps that are in front of people, you better start digging quickly

51:22.560 --> 51:28.000
and moving your way down and get out of the way and disappear. But by disappearing,

51:28.080 --> 51:33.360
you will become much, much bigger and it's impossible to usurp you.

51:33.360 --> 51:41.280
Yeah, I 100% agree with you. That's why you're so smart. This is the depersonalization and

51:42.560 --> 51:48.640
the algorithms that enable depersonalization almost like an operating system layer. So pushing away

51:48.640 --> 51:53.760
from the interface and the actual system that does the personalization. I think the challenges

51:53.760 --> 51:59.360
there, there's obviously technical challenges, but there's also societal challenges that

52:01.760 --> 52:06.160
it's like in a relationship. If you have an intimate algorithmic connection with

52:06.160 --> 52:12.400
individual humans, you can do both good and bad. And so there's risks that you're taking.

52:13.840 --> 52:19.040
So if you're making a lot of money now as Twitter and Facebook with ads, surface layer ads,

52:19.840 --> 52:27.280
what is the incentive to take the risk of guiding people more? Because you can hurt people,

52:27.280 --> 52:35.120
you can piss off people. There's a cost to forming a more intimate relationship with the users

52:36.000 --> 52:39.200
in the short term, I think. You said a really, really key thing,

52:40.880 --> 52:46.720
which was a really great emotional instinctive reaction, which is when I said the AGI thing,

52:46.720 --> 52:51.680
you said, well, how would you ever make money from that? That is the key. The presumption is

52:51.680 --> 52:56.080
that this thing would not be an important thing at the beginning. And I think what that allows

52:56.080 --> 53:01.760
you to do if you were Twitter or Google or Apple or Facebook, anybody, Microsoft, embarking on

53:01.760 --> 53:08.160
building something like this, is that you can actually have it off the critical path. And you

53:08.160 --> 53:14.480
can experiment with this for years if that's what it takes to find a version one that is special

53:14.480 --> 53:20.640
enough, where it's worth showcasing. And so in many ways, you get the free option. You're going

53:20.640 --> 53:25.840
to be spending any of these companies will be spending tens of billions of dollars in OpEx and

53:25.840 --> 53:33.840
CapEx every year and all kinds of stuff. It is not a thing that money actually makes more likely to

53:33.840 --> 53:39.760
succeed. In fact, you actually don't need to give these kinds of things a lot of money at all,

53:39.760 --> 53:46.880
because starting in 2023, right now, you know, you have the two most important tectonic shifts

53:46.880 --> 53:51.040
that have ever happened in our lifetime in technology. They're not talked about,

53:51.040 --> 53:56.240
but these things allow AGI, I think, to emerge over the next 10 or 15 years where it wasn't

53:56.240 --> 54:01.760
possible for the first thing is that the marginal cost of energy is zero, not going to pay for

54:01.760 --> 54:06.240
anything anymore. Right. And we can double click into why that why that is. And the second is the

54:06.240 --> 54:11.920
marginal cost of compute is zero. And so when you when you take the multiplication or, you know,

54:11.920 --> 54:16.320
if you want to get really fancy mathematically, the convolution of these two things together,

54:16.320 --> 54:23.600
it's going to change everything. So think about what a billion dollars gets today,

54:23.600 --> 54:29.680
and we can use open AI as an example. A billion dollars gets open AI, a handful of functional

54:29.680 --> 54:39.360
models, and a pretty fast iterative loop. Right. But imagine what open AI had to overcome. They had

54:39.360 --> 54:44.080
to overcome a compute challenge, they had to strip together a whole bunch of GPUs, they had to build

54:44.080 --> 54:49.360
all kinds of scaffolding software, they had to find data center support, that consumes all kinds

54:49.360 --> 54:55.280
of money. So that billion dollars didn't go that far. So it's a testament to how clever that open

54:55.280 --> 55:00.720
AI team is. But in four years from now, when energy costs zero, and basically GPUs are like,

55:00.720 --> 55:05.040
you know, they're falling off a truck, and you can use them for effectively for free.

55:06.560 --> 55:11.680
Now all of a sudden, a billion dollars gives you some amount of teraflops of compute, that is

55:11.680 --> 55:17.520
probably the total number of teraflops available today in the world. Like that's how gargantuan

55:18.160 --> 55:23.440
this move is when you take these two variables to zero. There's like a million things to ask,

55:23.440 --> 55:28.240
I almost don't want to get distracted by the marginal cost of energy going to zero,

55:28.240 --> 55:30.880
because I have no idea what you're talking about. That is fascinating.

55:30.880 --> 55:31.920
Can I give you the 30 seconds? Sure.

55:33.520 --> 55:37.600
So if you look inside of the two most progressive states, the three most progressive states, New

55:37.600 --> 55:42.400
York, California, and Massachusetts, a lot of left leaning folks, a lot of people who believe

55:42.400 --> 55:47.440
in climate science and climate change, the energy costs in those three states are the worst they are

55:47.520 --> 55:54.800
in the entire country. And energy is compounding at three to 4% per annum. So every decade to 15

55:54.800 --> 56:00.320
years, energy costs in these states double. In some cases, and in some months, our energy costs

56:00.320 --> 56:11.520
are increasing by 11% a month. But the ability to actually generate energy is now effectively zero.

56:11.520 --> 56:17.040
The cost per kilowatt hour to put a solar panel on your roof and a battery wall inside your garage,

56:17.040 --> 56:22.000
it's the cheapest it's ever been. These things are the most efficient they've ever been.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.880
And so to acquire energy from the sun and store it for your use later on,

56:26.880 --> 56:31.520
literally is a zero cost proposition. How do you explain the gap between the cost going?

56:31.520 --> 56:36.960
Great question. So this is the other side of regulatory capture, right? You know, we all

56:36.960 --> 56:42.320
fight to build monopolies. While there are monopolies hiding in plain sight, the utilities

56:42.320 --> 56:48.800
are a perfect example. There are 100 million homes in America. There are about 1700 utilities

56:48.800 --> 56:55.520
in America. So they have captive markets. But in return for that captive market, the law says,

56:55.520 --> 57:00.880
need to invest a certain amount per year in upgrading that power line, in changing out that

57:00.880 --> 57:07.440
turbine, in making sure you transition from coal to wind or whatever. Just as an example,

57:08.400 --> 57:13.120
upgrading power lines in the United States over the next decade is a $2 trillion proposition.

57:13.920 --> 57:20.480
These 1700 organizations have to spend, I think it's a quarter of a trillion dollars a year

57:21.840 --> 57:26.800
just to change the power lines. That is why even though it costs nothing to make energy,

57:27.440 --> 57:30.240
you are paying double every five every seven or eight years.

57:31.280 --> 57:35.040
It's capex and opex of a very brittle old infrastructure. It's like you

57:35.600 --> 57:39.440
trying to build an app and being forced to build your own data center. And you say,

57:39.440 --> 57:43.920
but wait, I just want to write to AWS. I just want to use GCP. I just want to move on.

57:44.720 --> 57:49.920
All that complexity is solved for me. And some law says, no, you can't, you got to use it. So

57:49.920 --> 57:54.960
that's what consumers are dealing with, but it's also what industrial and manufacturing organizations,

57:54.960 --> 58:00.720
it's what we all deal with. So how do we get rid ourselves of this old infrastructure that we're

58:00.720 --> 58:06.240
paying for? So the thing that's happening today, which I think is, this is why I think it's the

58:06.240 --> 58:13.280
most important trend right now in the world, is that a hundred million homeowners are each

58:13.280 --> 58:17.680
going to become their own little power plant and compete with these 1700 utilities.

58:19.680 --> 58:21.280
That is a great- In the United States or globally?

58:21.280 --> 58:24.880
No, just deal with the United States for a second, because I think it's easier to see here.

58:25.520 --> 58:29.840
A hundred million homes, solar panel on the roof. And by the way, just to make it clear,

58:29.840 --> 58:34.720
the sun doesn't need to shine. These panels now work where you have these UV bands that can

58:34.720 --> 58:39.680
actually extrapolate beyond the visible spectrum. So they're usable in all weather conditions.

58:40.480 --> 58:47.280
And a simple system can support you collecting enough power to not just run your functional

58:47.280 --> 58:53.680
day-to-day life, but then to contribute what's left over back into the grid for Google's data

58:53.680 --> 59:00.400
center or Facebook's data center, where you get a small check. The cost is going to zero.

59:00.400 --> 59:06.480
How obvious is this to people? You're making this up. Okay. So, because this is a pretty profound

59:06.480 --> 59:12.960
prediction, if the cost is indeed go to zero, that, I mean, the compute, the cost of compute

59:12.960 --> 59:16.080
going to zero, I can- So the cost of compute going to zero is-

59:16.080 --> 59:19.840
Can kind of understand, but the energy seems like a radical prediction of yours.

59:20.480 --> 59:25.280
Well, it's just naturally what's happening, right? Now, let me give you a different way

59:25.280 --> 59:31.440
of explaining this. If you look at any system, there's a really important thing that happens.

59:31.440 --> 59:36.080
It's what Clay Christensen calls crossing the chasm. If you explained it numerically,

59:36.080 --> 59:39.920
here's how I would explain it to you, Lex. If you introduce a disruptive product,

59:40.960 --> 59:46.320
typically what happens is the first three to 5% of people are these zealous believers,

59:46.320 --> 59:52.480
and they ignore all the logical reasons why this product doesn't make any sense,

59:53.600 --> 59:58.080
because they believe in the proposition of the future and they buy it. The problem is at 5%.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:04.560
If you want a product to get to mass market, you have one of two choices, which is you either

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:10.800
bring the cost down low enough or the feature set becomes so compelling that even at a high

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:17.360
price point. An example of the latter is the iPhone. The iPhone today, the 14 iPhone, costs

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.920
more than the original iPhone. It's probably doubled in price over the last 14 or 15 years,

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.600
but we view it as an essential element of what we need in our daily lives.

01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.360
It turns out that battery EVs and solar panels are an example of the former,

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:39.360
because people like President Biden with all of these subsidies have now introduced so much

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:46.400
money for people to just do this, where it is a money-making proposition for 100 million homes.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:53.920
What you're seeing as a result are all of these companies who want to get in front of that trend.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.920
Why? Because they want to own the relationship with 100 million homeowners. They want to manage

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:06.560
the power infrastructure, Amazon, Home Depot, Lowe's. Just name the company. If you do that

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:13.520
and you control that relationship, Amazon will probably say, if you're a member of Prime,

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:18.880
we'll stick the panels on your house for free. We'll do all the work for you

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:24.720
for free. It's just a feature of being a member of Prime. We'll manage all that energy for you.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:31.280
It makes so much sense. It is mathematically accretive for Amazon to do that. It's not accretive

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:38.080
for the existing energy industry because they get blown up. It's extremely accretive for peace

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.520
and prosperity. If you think the number of wars we fight over natural resources, take them all

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:50.160
off the table if we don't need energy from abroad, there's no reason to fight. You'd have to find a

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.600
reason to fight. Meaning, sorry, there'd be a moral reason to fight, but the last number of wars that

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.920
we fought were not as much rooted in morality as they were rooted in-

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:07.200
Yeah, it feels like they were very much rooted in conflict over resources, energy specifically.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.760
And then, sorry, just the last thing I want to say, I keep interrupting, apologies, but

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:17.520
the chips, what people want to say is that now that we're at two and three nanometer scale

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:24.560
for typical transistor fab, we're done. Forget about transistor density, forget about Moore's

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.920
Law, it's over. And I would just say, no, look at teraflops. And really, teraflops is the

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.120
combination of CPUs, but much, much less important, and really is the combination of ASICs, so

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:42.160
application-specific ICs and GPUs. And so you put the two together, I mean, if I gave you a billion

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:48.960
dollars five years from now, the amount of damage you could do, damage in good way, in terms of

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.440
building racks and racks of GPUs, the kind of models that you could build, the training sets

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:59.520
and the data that you could consume to solve a problem, it's enough to do something really

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.240
powerful, whereas today it's not yet quite enough. So there's this really interesting idea that you

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:10.640
talk about in terms of Facebook and Twitter that's connected to this, that if you were running

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:20.080
Twitter or Facebook, that you would move them all to AWS, so you would have somebody else to compute

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:26.560
the infrastructure. It probably, if you could explain that reasoning, means that you believe

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:31.360
in this idea of energy going to zero, compute going to zero, so let people that are optimizing that

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:39.520
do the best job. And I think that's a, you know, the initially in the early 2000s and the beginning

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:46.400
of the 2010s, if you were big enough scale, I'm sorry, everybody was building their own stuff,

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:53.840
then between 2010 through 2020, really the idea was everybody should be on AWS except the biggest

01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:01.680
of the biggest folks. I think in the 2020s and 30s, I think the answer is actually everybody

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:08.720
should be in these public clouds. And the reason is the engineering velocity of the guts. So,

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.680
you know, take a simple example, which is, you know, we have not seen a massive iteration in

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:18.640
database design until Snowflake, right? I think maybe Postgres was like the last big turn of the

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:26.480
dial. Why is that? I don't exactly know, except that everybody that's on AWS and everybody that's

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:34.640
on GCP and Azure gets to now benefit from $100-plus billion of aggregate market cap,

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:42.320
rapidly iterating, making mistakes, fixing, solving, learning, and that is a

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:50.160
best-in-class industry now, right? Then there's going to be all these AI layers around analytics

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:56.320
so that app companies can make better decisions. All of these things will allow you to build more

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.880
nimble organizations because you'll have this federated model of development.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.680
I'll take these things off the shelf. Maybe I'll roll my own stitching over here

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:12.240
because the thing that where you make money is still for most people and how the apps provision

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:17.680
and experience to a user. And everybody else can make a lot of money just servicing that.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:23.840
So they work in a really, they play well together in the sandbox. So in the future,

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.800
everybody just should be there. It doesn't make sense for anybody, I don't think, because,

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.520
if you were to roll your own data centers, for example, like Google for a long time

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.160
had these massive leaps where they had GFS and Bigtable. Those are really good in the

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:45.360
2000s and 2010s. And this is not to throw shade at Google. It's very hard for whatever exists

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:51.920
that is the progeny of GFS and Bigtable to be anywhere near as good as $100 billion industries

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:57.520
attempt to build that stack. And you're putting your organization under enormous pressure to

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:03.840
be that good. I guess the implied risk taken there is that you could become the next AWS,

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:11.680
like Tesla doing some of the compute in-house. I guess the bet there is that you can become

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:20.800
the next AWS for the new wave of computation if that level, if that kind of computation is

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:26.240
different. So if it's machine learning, I don't know if anyone's won that battle yet,

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.520
which is machine learning centric. Well, I think that software has a very powerful property

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:37.840
in that there's a lot of things that can happen asynchronously so that real-time

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:43.040
inference can be actually really lightweight code deployment. And that's why I think you

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:49.360
can have a very federated ecosystem inside of all of these places. Tesla is very different

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:55.040
because in order to build the best car, it's kind of like trying to build the best iPhone,

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.720
which is that you need to control it all the way down to the bare metal in order to do it well.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.680
And that's just not possible if you're trying to be a systems integrator,

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.320
which is what everybody other than this modern generation of car companies

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:14.160
have been. And they've done a very good job of that, but it won't be the experience that

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:20.320
allows you to win in the next 20 years. So let's linger on the social media thing.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:28.160
So you said if you ran Facebook for a day, let's extend that. If you were to build a new

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:35.280
social network today, how would you fix Twitter? How would you fix social media?

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:42.400
If you want to answer a different question, is if you were Elon Musk, somebody you know,

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.800
and you were taking over Twitter, what would you fix?

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:51.360
I thought about this a little bit. First of all, let me give you a backdrop. I wouldn't actually

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:56.960
build a social media company at all. And the answer is the reasoning is the following.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:03.440
I really tend to believe, as you probably got in a sense, of sort of patterns and probabilities.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:11.120
And if you said to me each month, probabilistically answer where are we going in apps

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:17.760
and social experiences, what I would say is, Lex, we spent the first decade building platforms

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.960
and getting them to scale. And if you want to think about it again, back to sort of this poker

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.960
analogy, others mistakes minus your mistakes is the value. Well, the value that was captured

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.840
was trillions of dollars, essentially to Apple and to Google. And they did that by basically

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:44.480
attracting billions of monthly active users to their platform. Then this next wave were the apps,

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.800
Facebook, QQ, Tencent, TikTok, Twitter, Snapchat, that whole panoply of apps.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:00.320
And interestingly, they were in many ways an atomized version of the platforms, right? They

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.920
sat on top of them. They were an ecosystem participant, but the value they created was

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:12.640
the same. Trillions of dollars of enterprise value, billions of monthly active users.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.080
Well, there's an interesting phenomenon that's kind of hiding in plain sight,

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:25.680
which is that the next most obvious atomic unit are content creators. Now, let me give you two

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:31.920
examples. Lex Fridman, this random crazy guy, Mr. Beast, you know, Jimmy Donaldson,

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:37.920
just the two of you alone, add it up, okay? And you guys are going to approach in the next five

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.320
years a billion people. The only thing that you guys haven't figured out yet is how to capture

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.760
trillions of dollars of value. Now, maybe you don't want to, and maybe that's not your stated

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.160
mission. Right, right. But let's just look at Mr. Beast alone because he is trying to do exactly

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.160
that probably. Yeah. And I think Jimmy is going to build an enormous business. But if you take

01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:00.640
Jimmy and all of the other content creators, right, you guys are atomizing what the apps have

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:07.680
done. You're providing your own curated news feeds. You're providing your own curated communities.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:12.560
You're allowed, you let people move in and out of these things in a very lightweight way,

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:17.520
and value is accruing to you. So the honest answer to your question is I would focus on the content

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.160
creator side of things because I believe that's where the puck is going. That's a much more

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:28.400
important shift in how we all consume information and content and are entertained.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.560
It's through brands like you. Individual people that we can humanize and understand

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:38.560
are the filter. But aren't you just arguing against the point you made earlier,

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.920
which is what you would recommend is the investment in the AGI, the depersonalization?

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:48.880
Because they could still be a participant. In that end state, if that happens,

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:55.120
you have the option value of being an enabler of that, right? You can help improve what they do.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:11:01.040
Again, you can be this bare metal service provider where you can be a tax, right? You

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.520
can participate in everything that you do, every question that's asked, every comment that's curated.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:11.680
If you could have more intelligence as you provide a service to your fans and your audience,

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.440
you would probably pay a small percentage of that revenue. I suspect all content creators would.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.200
It's that stack of services that is like a smart human being. It's like, how do you help produce

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:28.080
this information? You would pay a producer for that. Maybe you would. Back to your question,

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.280
what would I do? I think that you have to move into that world pretty aggressively.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:39.840
I think that right now you first have to solve what is broken inside of these social networks.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:44.720
I don't think it's a technical problem. Just to put it out there, I don't think it's

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:52.240
a... It's one where there are these nefarious organizations. That happens. Brigading XYZ,

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:58.080
that happens. But the real problem is a psychological one that we're dealing with,

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:09.280
which is people through a whole set of situations have lost belief in themselves.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:19.520
And I think that that comes up as this very virulent form of rejection that they tried to

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:23.600
put into these social networks. So if you look inside of comments on anything, like you could

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:31.120
have a person that says on Twitter, I saved this dog from a fiery building, and there would be

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:38.400
negative commenters. And you're like, well, again, put yourself in their shoes. How do I steel man

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.720
their case? I do this all the time. I get people throw shade at me. I'm like, okay, let me steel

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.560
man their point of view. And the best that I can come up with is I'm working really hard over here.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:54.160
I'm trying. I played by all the rules that were told to me. I've played well. I played fairly.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:00.960
And I am not being rewarded in a system of value that you recognize. And that is making me mad.

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:08.000
And now I need to cope and I need to vent. So back in the day, my dad used to drink. He would

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.160
make me go get things to hit me with. Today, you go to Twitter, you spot off, you try to deal with

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.800
the latent anger that you feel. So a social network has to be designed, in my opinion,

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.400
to solve that psychological corner case, because it is what makes a network unusable.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:31.360
To get real density, you have to find a way of moving away from that toxicity because it

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.640
ruins a product experience. You could have the best pixels in the world. But if people are

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:41.920
virulently spitting into their keyboards, other people are just going to say, you know what,

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:49.360
I'm done with this. It doesn't make me feel good. So the social network has to have a social cost.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.160
You can do it in a couple ways. One is where you have real world identity. So then there's a cost

01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:01.680
to being virulent. And there's a cost to being caustic. A second way is to actually just overlay

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:07.440
an economic framework so that there's a more pertinent economic value that you assign to

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.360
basically spouting off. And the more you want to spend, the more you can say.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:17.280
And I think both have a lot of value. I don't know what the right answer is. I tend to like the

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:23.280
latter. I think real world identity shuts down a lot of debate because there's still too much,

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:30.400
there's a sensation that there'll be some retribution. So I think there's more free

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:35.840
speech over there, but it cannot be costless. Because in that there's a level of toxicity

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:41.040
that just makes these products unusable. A third option, and by the way, all these

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:47.040
can work together. If we look at this, what you call the corner case, which is hilarious,

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:57.920
what I would call the human condition, which is, you know, that anger is rooted with the challenges

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:10.160
of life. And what about having an algorithm that shows you what you see, that's personalized to

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:18.160
you and helps you maximize your personal growth in the long term, such that you're challenging

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:25.600
yourself, you're improving, you're learning. There's just enough of criticism to keep you on

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:31.920
your toes, but just enough of like the dopamine rush to keep you entertained and finding that

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.640
balance for each individual person. You just described an AGI of a very empathetic,

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:43.280
well-rounded friend. Yes, exactly. And then you can throw that person, even anonymous,

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.840
into a pool of discourse and they would be better. I think you're absolutely right.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.680
That's a very, very, very elegant way of stating it. You're absolutely right. But like you said,

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:59.840
the AGI might be a few years away, so that's a huge investment. My gut feeling is this thing

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:06.480
we're calling AGI is actually not that difficult to build technically, but it requires a certain

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:13.280
culture and it requires certain risks to be taken. I think you could reductively boil down

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:23.760
the human intellect into cognition and emotion. Depending on who you are and depending on the

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:30.080
moment, they're weighted very differently, obviously. Cognition is so easily done by computers

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.480
that we should assume that that's a solved problem. Our differentiation is the reasoning

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.600
part. It's the emotional overlay. It's the empathy. It's the ability to steal man the opposite person's

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:48.400
case and feel why that person, you can forgive them without excusing what they did, as an example.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:56.480
That is a very difficult thing, I think, to capture in software, but I think it's a matter of when,

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:06.080
not if. If done crudely, it takes a form of censorship, just banning people off the platform.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:13.360
Let me ask you some tricky questions. Do you think Trump should have been removed from Twitter?

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:13.600
No.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:20.160
What's the pro case? I'm having fun here. Can you steal man each side?

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:29.280
Yeah. Let's steal man to get him off the platform. Here we have a guy who

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:43.520
is virulent in all ways. He promotes confrontation. He lacks decorum. He incites the fervent believers

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:49.680
of his cause to act up and push the boundaries, bordering on and potentially even including

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:57.920
breaking the law. He does not observe the social norms of a society that keep us while functioning,

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.360
including an orderly transition of power. If he is left in a moment where he feels trapped

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.280
and cornered, he could behave in ways that will confuse the people that believe in him

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:17.760
to act in ways that they so regret that it could bring our democracy to an end

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:24.320
or create so much damage or create a wound that's so deep, it will take years of conflict and years

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:31.280
of confrontation to heal it. We need to remove him and we need to do it now. It's been too long.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:38.640
We've let it go on too long. The other side of the argument would be he was a duly elected person

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:48.560
whose views have been run over for way too long and he uses the ability to say extreme things

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:57.440
in order to showcase how corrupt these systems have become and how insular these organizations

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:03.440
are in protecting their own class. If you really want to prevent class warfare and if you really

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:08.640
want to keep the American dream alive for everybody, we need to show that the First

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:14.960
Amendment, the Constitution, the Second Amendment, all of this infrastructure is actually bigger than

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:21.600
any partisan view no matter how bad it is and that people will make their own decisions.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:30.400
There are a lot of people that can see past the words he uses and focus on the substance of what

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:36.720
he's trying to get across and more generally agree than disagree. When you silence that voice,

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:43.760
what you're effectively saying is this is a rigged game and all of those things that we were told

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.440
were not true are actually true. If you were to look at the crude algorithms of Twitter,

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.240
of course, I don't have any insider knowledge, but I could imagine that they saw,

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:03.120
let's say there's a metric that measures how negative the experience is of the platform

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:09.920
and they probably saw in several ways. You could look at this, but the presence of Donald Trump on

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:17.040
the platform was consistently increasing how shitty people are feeling short term and long term

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:20.880
because they're probably yelling at each other, having worse and worse and worse experience.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:25.760
If you even do a survey of how do you feel about using this platform over the last week,

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:32.480
they would say horrible relative to maybe a year ago when Donald Trump was not actively tweeting

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:39.360
or so on. Here you're sitting at Twitter and saying, okay, I know everyone's talking about

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:43.600
speech and all that kind of stuff, but I want to build a platform where the users are happy

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:50.000
and they're becoming more and more unhappy. How do I solve this happiness problem? Well, let's

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.400
ban the sources of the unhappiness. Now, we can't just say you're a source of unhappiness,

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:07.840
we'll ban you. Let's wait until that source say something that we can claim breaks our rules,

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.440
like incites violence or so on. That would work if you could measure

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.040
your construct of happiness properly. The problem is I think what Twitter looked at were active

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:22.000
commenters and got it confused for overall system happiness because for every piece of content

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.800
that's created on the internet of the hundred people that consume it, maybe one or two people

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:34.400
comment on it. By over-amplifying that signal and assuming that it was the plurality of people,

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:39.760
that's where they actually made a huge blunder because there was no scientific method, I think,

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:46.640
to get to the answer of deplatforming him. It did expose this idea that it's a bit of a rigged game

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:54.480
and that there are these deep biases that some of these organizations have to opinions that

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:57.200
are counter to theirs and to their orthodox view of the world.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:04.560
So, in general, you lean towards keeping, first of all, presidents on the platform, but also

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.280
controversial voices?

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:10.720
All the time. I think it's really important to keep them there.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:17.520
Let me ask you a tricky one in the recent news that's become especially relevant for me. What

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:24.000
do you think about if you've been paying attention to Kanye West, a recent controversial outburst on

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:34.160
social media about Jews, black people, racism in general, slavery, holocaust, all of these topics

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:41.680
that he touched on in different ways, on different platforms, including Twitter? What do you do with

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:48.960
that? What do you do with that from a platform perspective? What do you do from a human perspective?

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:54.720
What do you do with that from a platform perspective? What do you do from a humanity

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.000
perspective of how to add love to the world?

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.600
Should we take both sides of that?

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:02.240
Sure.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:09.280
Option one is he is completely out of line and option two is he's not. Just to simplify.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:09.680
Sure. Right.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:21.680
So the path one is he's an incredibly important tastemaker in the world that defines the belief

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:31.760
system for a lot of people. And there just is no room for any form of racism or bias or anti-Semitism

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:38.160
in today's day and age, particularly by people whose words and comments will be amplified around

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:44.720
the world. We've already paid a large price for that. And then the expectation of success

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:49.680
is some amount of societal decorum that keeps moving the ball forward.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:59.120
The other side would say life, I think, goes from harmony to disharmony to repair.

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:06.400
And anybody who has gone through a very complicated divorce will tell you that

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:13.120
in that moment, your life is extremely disharmonious and you are struggling to cope.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:22.320
And because he is famous, we are seeing a person really struggling in a moment

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:29.840
that may need help. And we owe it to him, not for what he said, because that stuff isn't

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:36.480
excusable, but we owe it to him to help him in a way, and particularly his friends.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:43.520
And if he has real friends, hopefully what they see is that what I see on the outside looking in

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.600
is a person that is clearly struggling.

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:53.360
Can I ask you like a human question? And I know it's outside looking in, but

01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.400
there's several questions I want to ask. So one is about the pain of going through a divorce

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:05.120
and having kids and all that kind of stuff. And two, when you're rich and powerful

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.560
and famous, I don't know, maybe you can enlighten me to which is the most

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.880
corruptive. But how do you know who are the friends to trust?

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:24.800
So a lot of the world is calling Kanye insane, or like has mental illness, all that kind of stuff.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.600
And so how do you have friends close to you that say something like that message,

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:38.960
but from a place of love and where they actually care for you as opposed to trying to get you to

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:45.600
shut up? The reason I ask all those questions, I think, if you care about the guy, how do you help

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:53.680
him? Right. I've been through a divorce. It's gut wrenching. The most horrible part is having

01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:01.600
to tell your kids. I can't even describe to you how proud I am of and how resilient these three

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.880
beautiful little creatures were when my ex-wife and I had to sit them down and talk through it.

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:16.640
Talk through it. And for that thing, I'll be just so protective of them and so proud of them.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:24.480
It's hard. Now, I don't know that that's what he went through, but it doesn't matter. In that

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.560
moment, there's no fame, there's no money, there's nothing. There's just the raw intimacy of a nuclear

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:35.840
family breaking up in that there is a death, and it's the death of that idea. And that is

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:41.440
extremely, extremely profound in its impact, especially in your children.

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:49.200
It is really hard. Really hard. Could you have seen yourself in the way you see the world

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:56.560
being clouded during, especially at first, to where you would make poor decisions outside of

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:05.280
that nuclear family? So poor business decisions, poor tweeting decisions, poor writing decisions.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:11.680
If I had to boil down a lot of those, what I would say is that there are moments in my life,

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:19.760
Lex, where I have felt meaningfully less than. And in those moments, the loop that I would fall into

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:25.920
is I would look to cope and be seen by other people. So I would throw away all of the work

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:32.320
I was doing around my own internal validation, and I would try to say something or do something

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:39.440
that would get the attention of others. And oftentimes, when that loop was unproductive,

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:48.080
it's because those things had really crappy consequences. So I went through that as well.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:55.440
So I had to go through this disharmonious phase in my life and then to repair it. I had the benefit

01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:05.200
of meeting someone and building a relationship block by block where there was just enormous

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:15.680
accountability, where my partner Nat has just incredible empathy but accountability.

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:21.680
And so she can put herself in my shoes sometimes when I'm a really tough person to be around,

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.640
but then she doesn't let me off the hook. She can forgive me, but it doesn't make

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:33.040
what I may have said or whatever excusable. And that's been really healthy for me,

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:40.480
and it's helped me repair my relationships, be a better parent, be a better friend to my ex-wife

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:46.160
who's a beautiful woman who I love deeply and will always love her. And it took me a few years

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:51.440
to see that, that it was just a chapter that had come to an end, but she's an incredible mother

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:55.920
and an incredible businesswoman. And I'm so thankful that I've had two incredible women

01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:03.280
in my life. That's like a blessing. But it's hard to find a person that has that,

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:08.080
a lot of stuff you said is pretty profound, but having that person who has empathy and

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:15.840
accountability. So basically that's ultimately what great friendship is, which is people that

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.800
love you, have empathy for you, but can also call you out on your bullshit.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:25.280
She's a LeBron James-like figure. And the reason I say that is I've seen and met so many people,

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.760
I've seen the distribution on the scale of friendship and empathy.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:32.480
She's the LeBron James of friendship.

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:37.200
She's a goat. Well, what's so funny is like, you know, we have a dinner around poker,

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.240
and it's taken on a life of its own, mostly because of her, because these guys look to her.

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:52.400
And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Her registers are already full. She's doing all kinds of crap with

01:29:52.400 --> 01:30:04.160
me. But it's a very innate skill. But it's not just an emotional thing, meaning she's the person

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:10.000
that I make all my decisions with. These decisions we're making together as a team. I've never

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.040
understood that. You know, there's that African proverb, like, go fast, go alone, go far, go

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:23.440
together. And since I was born, I was by myself. And I had to cope. And I didn't have a good toolkit

01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:28.560
to use into the world. And in these last five or six years, she's helped me. And at first,

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:34.480
my toolkit was literally like sticks, you know? And then I found a way to, you know,

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:38.800
she helped me sharpen a little rock, and that became a little knife, but even that was crap.

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:44.000
And then she showed me fire, and then I forged a knife. And that's what it feels like, where now

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:52.640
this toolkit is like most average people. And I feel humble to be average, because I was down

01:30:52.640 --> 01:31:01.200
here on the ground. So it's made all these things more reasonable. So I see what comes from having

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:06.560
deep, profound friendships and love to help you through these critical moments. I have another

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:15.040
friend who I would say just completely unabashedly loves me, this guy Rob Goldberg. He doesn't hold

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:18.400
me accountable that much, which I love. Like I could say, I killed a homeless person. He's like,

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:23.360
ah, they probably deserved it, you know? Whereas Nat would be like, that was not good, what you

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:29.680
just did. But I have both. I mean, I have Nat every day. You know, Rob, I don't talk to that often,

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:38.160
but to have two people, I had zero. I think most people unfortunately have zero. So I think like

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:46.080
what he needs is somebody to just listen. You don't have to put a label on these things.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:52.720
And you just have to try to guide in these very unique moments where you can just de-escalate

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:59.040
what is going on in your mind. And I suspect what's going on in his mind, again, to play

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:04.800
armchair quarterback, I don't know, is that he is in a moment where he just feels lower than low.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:13.440
And we all do it. We've all had these moments where we don't know how to get attention. And if you

01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:17.760
didn't grow up in a healthy environment, you may go through a negative way to get attention.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:22.640
And it's not to excuse it, but it's to understand it.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:33.680
That's so profound, the feeling less than, and at those low points, going externally to find it,

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:40.800
and maybe creating conflict and scandal to get that attention.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:47.200
The way that my doctor explained it to me is you have to think about your self-worth

01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:55.600
like a knot. It's inside of a very complicated set of knots. Some people don't have these knots,

01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:00.400
it's just presented to you on a platter. But for some of us, because of the way we grow up,

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:06.480
it's covered in all these knots. So the whole goal is to loosen those knots.

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:14.000
And it happens slowly, it happens unpredictably, and it takes a long time. And so while you're

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:18.080
doing that, you are going to have moments where when you feel less than, you're not prepared

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:22.000
to look inside and say, actually, here's how I feel about myself. It's pretty cool. I'm happy

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:31.520
with where I'm at. I have to ask on the topic of friendship, you do an amazing podcast called

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:36.560
All In Podcast. People should stop listening to this and go listen to that. You just did your

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:46.880
100th episode. It's one of my favorite podcasts. It's incredible for the technical and the human

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:53.200
psychological wisdom that you guys constantly give in the way you analyze the world, but also

01:33:53.200 --> 01:34:03.600
just the chemistry between you. There's a tension and there's camaraderie that's all laid out on the

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:10.240
table. So I don't know the two Davids that well, but I have met Jason. What do you love about him?

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.920
I mean, I'll give you a little psychological breakdown of all three of these guys.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.420
Sure.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.360
Just my opinion.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:17.600
Yeah.

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.320
And I love you guys.

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.560
Would they agree with your psychological breakdown?

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:30.000
I don't know. I think that what I would say about J. Cal is he is unbelievably loyal

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:41.440
to no end. And he's like any of those movies which are about the mafia or whatever, where

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.800
like something bad's going wrong and you need somebody to show up, that's J. Cal.

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:51.520
So if you killed the said proverbial homeless person, he would be right there to help you.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:57.680
He's the one that he'll defend you in every way, shape or form, even if it doesn't make sense in

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.760
that moment. He doesn't see that as an action of whether it'll solve the problem. He sees that as

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.240
an act of devotion to you, your friend. And that's an incredible gift that he gives us.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.800
The other side of it is that J. Cal needs to learn how to trust that other people love him

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:22.800
back as much as he loves us. And that's where he makes mistakes because he assumes that he's

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:27.520
not as lovable as the rest of us. But he's infinitely more lovable than he understands.

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:35.360
You have to see Lex. He is unbelievably funny. I cannot tell you how funny this guy is.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:37.840
Next level funny.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:38.880
His timing.

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:39.520
Timing.

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:39.920
Everything.

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:46.880
Charm. The care he takes. So he is as lovable but he doesn't believe himself to be. And that

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.560
manifests itself in areas that drive us all crazy from time to time.

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:55.120
Which makes it for a very pleasant listening experience. Okay, so what about the other two

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:59.680
Davids? David Sacks and David Friedberg. David Sacks is the one that I would say I have the

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:06.240
most emotional connection with. He and I can go a year without talking. And then we'll talk for

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:11.840
four hours straight. And then we know where we are. And we have this ability to pick up and have a

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.480
level of intimacy with each other. And I think that's just because I've known David for so long

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:24.000
now that I find really comforting. And then Friedberg is this person who I think similar to me

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:30.160
had a very turbulent upbringing. Has fought through it to build an incredible life for himself.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:36.160
And I have this enormous respect for his journey. I don't particularly care about his outcomes to

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:43.200
be honest. But I just have, I look at that guy and I think he did it. And so if I didn't do it,

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:55.680
I would be glad that he did it, if it makes any sense. And you can see that he feels like his

01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:07.760
entire responsibility is really around his kids. And to give a better counterfactual. And sometimes

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.840
I think he gets that right and wrong. But he's a very special human being that way.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:18.720
On that show, the two of you have a very, from a geopolitics perspective,

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:25.200
I don't know, there's just a very effective way to think deeply about the world,

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:28.560
the big picture of the world. He's a very systems level thinker,

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.400
which I really, really like. Yeah. Absolutely.

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:40.240
Very systems level. And he's very rooted in a broad body of knowledge, which I have a

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:46.960
tremendous respect for. He brings all these things in. Sachs is incredible because he has this

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:52.480
unbelievable understanding of things, but it has a core nucleus. So Friedberg can just basically

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:57.200
abstract a whole bunch of systems and talk about it. I tend to be more like that, where I try to

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:03.920
find it to be more of a puzzle. Sachs is more like anchored in a philosophical and historical

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:10.000
context as the answer. And he starts there, but he gets to these profound understandings of systems

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:19.360
as well. On the podcast, In Life, you guys hold to your opinion pretty strong. What's the secret

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:25.360
to being able to argue passionately with friends? So hold your position, but also not murder each

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:31.680
other, which you guys seem to come close to. I think it's like strong opinions, weakly held.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:39.520
Wait, is that a haiku? Can you explain that, please?

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:46.160
Yeah. Look, today, you and I, we steel man the two sides of three different things.

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:53.440
Yeah. Now you could be confused and think, I believe in those things. I believe that it's

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.680
important to be able to intellectually traverse there, whether I believe in it or not, and steel

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:03.760
man, not scum. But we intro those things by saying, let us steel man this position.

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.000
Sometimes you guys skip the- You're right. We edit those things out,

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.720
and sometimes we'll sit on either sides and we'll just bat things back and forth just to see

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:18.960
what the other person thinks. So that's how, as fans, we should listen to that sometimes.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.240
Because you hold a strong opinion sometimes. For example, the cost of energy going to zero

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:36.640
is that- What's the degree of certainty on that? Is this like you really taking a prediction of

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:44.080
how the world will unroll, and if it does, this will benefit a huge amount of companies and people

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:50.960
that will believe that idea. So you spend a few days, a few weeks with that idea.

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:59.600
I've been spending two years with that idea, and that idea has manifested into many pages and pages

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:07.120
of more and more branches of a tree. But it started with that idea. So if you think about

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.880
this tree, this logical tree that I built, I would consider it more of a mosaic. And at the base or

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:17.680
root, however you want to talk about it, is this idea, the incremental cost of energy goes to zero.

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:23.680
How does it manifest? And so I talked about one traversal, which is the competition of households

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:30.320
versus utilities. But if even some of that comes to pass, we're going to see a bunch of other

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:35.280
implications from a regulatory and technology perspective. If some of those come to pass-

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:45.280
So I've tried to think this six, seven, eight hops forward, and I have some- To use a chess analogy,

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:51.040
I have a bunch of short lines, which I think can work. And I've started to test those by making

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:57.200
investments, tens of millions over here to a hundred millions over there. But it's a distribution

01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:03.520
based on how probabilistic I think these outcomes are and how downside protected I can be and how

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:09.120
much I will learn, how many mistakes I can make, et cetera. And then very quickly over the next

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:13.520
two years, some of those things will happen or not happen, and I will rapidly re-underwrite.

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.520
And I'll rewrite that tree, and then I'll get some more data, I'll make some more investments,

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:25.440
and I'll rapidly re-underwrite. So in order for me to get to this tree, maybe you can ask,

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:31.200
how did I get there? It was a complete accident. The way that it happened was I have a friend of

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:34.720
mine who works at a great organization called Fortress, his name is Drew McKnight, and he

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.000
called me one day and he said, hey, I'm doing a deal, will you anchor it? We're going public.

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:45.040
And it's a rare earth mining company. And I said, Drew, I'm going to get tarred and feathered in

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.600
Silicon Valley for backing a mining company. And he said, just talk to the guy and learn.

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:54.880
And the guy, Jim Latinsky, blew me away. He's like, here's what it means for energy,

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.680
and here's what it means for the supply chain, and here's what it means for the United States

01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:05.120
versus China. But lax, I did that deal and then I did seven others. And that deal made money,

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:13.360
the seven others. But I learned, I made enough mistakes where the net of it was I got to a thesis

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:19.040
that I believed in, I could see it. And I was like, okay, I paid the price, I acquired the learning,

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:24.640
I made my mistakes, I know where I am at, and this is step one. And then I learned a little

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:30.240
bit more, I made some more investments. And that's how I do the job. The minute that you

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:35.440
try to wait for perfection in order to make a bet either on yourself or a company,

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:43.680
a girlfriend, whatever, it's too late. So if we just linger on that tree, it seems like a lot

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:51.520
of geopolitics, a lot of international military even conflict is around energy. So how does your

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:57.440
thinking about energy connect to what you see happening in the next 10, 20 years? Maybe you

01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:04.640
can look at the war in Ukraine, or relationship with China and other places through this lens of

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:10.800
energy. What's the hopeful, what's the cynical trajectory that the world might take through

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:14.720
with this drive towards zero energy, zero cost energy?

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.920
So the United States was in a period of energy surplus until the last few years,

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:23.520
some number of years in Trump and I think some number of now the current administration with

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:31.040
President Biden. But we know what it means to basically have more than enough energy

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.840
to fund our own domestic manufacturing and living standards.

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:42.240
And I think that by being able to generate this energy from the sun, that is very capex efficient,

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:50.880
that is very climate efficient, gives us a huge tailwind. The second thing is that we are now

01:43:50.880 --> 01:43:57.840
in a world in a regime for many years to come of non-zero interest rates. And it may interest you

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:08.720
to know that really the last time that we had long dated wars supported at low interest rates

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.040
was World War II, where I think the average interest rate was like 1.07% in the 10 year.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:20.720
And every other war tends to have these very quick open and closes, because these long protracted

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.640
fights get very difficult to finance when rates are non-zero. So just as an example,

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.440
even starting in 2023, so the practical example today in the United States is President Biden's

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:38.400
budget is about 1.5 trillion for next year. That's not including the entitlement spending,

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:42.960
meaning Medicare, Social Security. So the stuff that he wants to spend that he has

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:49.760
discretion over is about 1.582 trillion is the exact number. Next year, our interest payments

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:56.000
are going to be $455 billion. That's 29% of every budget dollar is going to pay interest.

01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:05.040
So you have these two worlds coming together, right Lex? If you have us hurtling forward

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:11.680
to being able to generate our own energy and the economic peril that comes with trying to underwrite

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.960
several trillion dollars for war, which we can't afford to pay when rates are at 5%,

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:23.520
means that despite all the bluster, the probabilistic distribution of us engaging

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:31.920
in war with Russia and Ukraine seems relatively low. The override would obviously be a moral

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.880
reason to do it that may or may not come if there's some nuclear proliferation.

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.240
But now you have to steel man the other side of the equation, which is well, what were to happen

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.960
if you were sitting there and you were Putin? Let's steel man setting off a tactical nuke

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:56.880
someplace. Okay, I'm getting calls every other day from my two largest energy buyers, India and

01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:06.880
China, telling me slow my roll. I have the entire world looking to find the final excuse to turn me

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:13.520
off and unplug me from the entire world economy. The only morally reprehensible thing that's left

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:17.760
in my arsenal that could do all of these things together would be to set off a tactical nuke.

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.680
I would be the only person since World War II to have done that.

01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:33.040
I mean, it seems like it's a really, really, really big step to take. And so I think that

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.120
X of the clamoring for war that the military industrial complex wants us to buy into,

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:45.200
do. The financial reasons to do it and the natural resources needs to do it

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:53.440
are making it very unlikely. That is not just true for us. I think it's also true for Europe.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:47:00.800
I think the European economy is going to roll over. I see a very hard landing for them,

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.200
which means that if the economy slows down, there's going to be less need for energy.

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:12.320
And so it starts to become a thing where a negotiated settlement is actually the win-win

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:17.840
for everybody. But none of this would be possible without zero interest rates.

01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:20.880
In a world of zero interest rates, we would be in war.

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:30.960
So you believe in the financial forces and pressures overpowering the human ones.

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:34.240
I really do believe in the human ones. Even in international war.

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.280
More so there. I think the invisible hand, and by the invisible hand for the audience,

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:45.520
I think really what it means is the financial complex and really the central bank complex

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:51.920
and the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy is a very convoluted and complicated

01:47:52.480 --> 01:48:00.960
set of things. But if we had zero interest rates, we would be probably in the middle of it now.

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:09.280
See, there's a complexity to this game at the international level where some nations are

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:18.800
authoritarian and there's significant corruption. And so that adds, from a game theoretic optimal

01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:23.760
perspective, the invisible hand is operating in the mud.

01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.000
Preventing war. The person that is the most important figure in the world right now is

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.120
Jerome Powell. He is probably doing more to prevent war than anybody else.

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.480
He keeps ratcheting rates. It's just impossible. It's a mathematical impossibility for the United

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.000
States unless there is such a cataclysmic moral transgression by Russia. So there is tail risk

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:49.680
that it is possible where we say, forget it. All bets are off. We're going back to zero rates,

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:54.240
issue a hundred year bond. We're going to finance a war machine. There is a small risk of that.

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:58.720
But I think the majority of outcomes is more of a negotiated settlement.

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:05.360
So what's the motivation of Putin to invade Ukraine in the first place? If financial

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:15.920
forces are the most powerful forces, why did it happen? Because it seems like there's other

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:25.120
forces at play of maintaining superpower status on the world stage. It seems like geopolitics

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:29.760
doesn't happen just with the invisible hand in consideration.

01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.600
I agree with that. I can't beg to know, to be honest. I don't know. But he did it.

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:43.040
I think it's easier for me to guess the outcome from here. It would have been impossible for me

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:49.920
to really understand. It is what got him to this place. But it seems like there's an end game here

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:57.520
and there's not much playability. I feel like I'm on unsteady ground because

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:01.760
there's been so many experts at every stage of this that have been wrong.

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:09.120
Well, there are no experts. There are no experts, Lex.

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.720
I understand this. Well, let's dig into that because we just said Phil Hellmuth is the

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:21.440
greatest poker player of all time. He has an opinion. They would be mistaken.

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:28.720
Ivy has an opinion as well on how to play all these games. Meaning an opinion means here's the

01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.440
lines I take, here are the decisions I make. I live and die by those and if I'm right, I win.

01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:37.360
If I'm wrong, I lose. I've made more mistakes than my opponent.

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:43.600
I thought you said there's an optimal. So aren't there people that have a deeper

01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:51.040
understanding, a higher likelihood of being able to describe and know the optimal set of actions here

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:59.040
at every layer? There may be a theoretically set of optimal decisions, but you can't play your life

01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:05.680
against a computer. Meaning the minute that you face an opponent

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:08.800
and that person takes you off that optimal path, you have to adjust.

01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:13.120
Yeah. Like what happens if a tactical nuke?

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:20.400
It would be really bad. I think the world is resilient enough. I think the Ukrainians are

01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:25.280
resilient enough to overcome it. It would be really bad. It's just an incredibly sad moment

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:31.040
in human history. But do you wonder what US does? Is there any understanding? Do you think people

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:37.040
inside the United States understand? Not the regular citizens, but people in the military?

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.960
Do you think Joe Biden understands? I think Joe Biden does understand.

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.880
You think they have a clear plan? I think that there are

01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.120
few reasons to let the gerontocracy rule, but this is one of the reasons where I think they

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:57.200
are better adept than other people. Folks that were around during the Bay of Pigs,

01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:03.440
folks that hopefully have studied that and studied nuclear de-escalation will have a

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:12.320
better playbook than I do. My suspicion is that there is an emergency break glass plan.

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:20.720
I think before military intervention or anything else, I think that there are an enormous number of

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:28.720
financial sanctions that you can do to just completely cripple Russia that they haven't

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:35.360
undertaken yet. If you couple that with an economic system in Europe that is less and

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:42.880
less in need of energy because it is going into a recession, it makes it easier for them to be

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:50.000
able to walk away while the US ships a bunch of LNG over there. I don't know the game theory on

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:58.160
all of this, but- Does it make you nervous or are we just being temperamental? It feels like the

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:07.440
world hangs in a balance. It feels like, at least from my naive perspective, I thought

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:13.200
we were getting to a place where surely human civilization can't destroy itself. Here's a

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:19.600
presentation of what looks like a hot war where multiple parties involved in escalation towards

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:26.960
a world war is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. It's not. I would really, really hope

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:32.560
that he is spending time with his two young twins.

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:40.320
Well, this is part of what I- I really hope he's spending time with his kids.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:48.720
Agreed, but not kids, not just kids, but friends. I'm not sure that he may not have friends, but

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:54.320
it's very hard for anybody to look at their kids and not think about protecting the future.

01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:02.640
Well, partially because of the pandemic, but partially because of the nature of power,

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.440
it feels like you're surrounded by people who you can't trust more and more. I do think the

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:13.680
pandemic had an effect on that too, the isolating effect. A lot of people were not their best selves

01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:19.600
during the pandemic. From a super heavy topic, let me go back to the space where you're one

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:25.920
of the most successful people in the world. How to build companies, how to find good companies,

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:31.280
what it takes to find good companies, what it takes to build good companies. What advice do

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:36.320
you have for someone who wants to build the next super successful startup in the tech space

01:54:36.960 --> 01:54:42.960
and have a chance to be impactful like Facebook, Apple? I think that's the key word. If

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.280
your precondition is to start something successful, you've already failed

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:51.280
because now you're playing somebody else's game. What success means is not clear.

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.440
You're walking into the woods. It's murky. It's dark. It's wet. It's raining. There's all

01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:03.680
these animals about. There's no comfort there. So you better really like hiking.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:12.640
And there's no short way to shortcut that. So isn't it obvious what success is? Like,

01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:19.280
success is scale. So it's not what it is. No, I think that there's a very brittle basic

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:30.480
definition of success that's outside in, but that's not what it is. I know people that are

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:40.400
much, much, much richer than I am, and they are just so completely broken. And I think to myself,

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:46.800
the only difference between you and me is outsiders' perception of your wealth versus mine.

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:53.040
But the happiness and the joy that I have in the simple, basic routines of my life

01:55:53.840 --> 01:56:02.160
give me enormous joy. And so I feel successful. No matter what anybody says about my success

01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:10.240
or lack of success, there are people that live normal lives, that have good jobs, that have good

01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:16.080
families. You know, I've had this, like, idealic sense. Like, I see it on TikTok all the time,

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.200
so I know it exists. These neighborhoods where there's like a cul-de-sac and these beautiful

01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:27.600
homes and these kids are biking around. And every time I see that, Lex, I immediately flashback

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:33.680
to what I didn't have. And I think that's success. Look at how happy those kids are.

01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:39.280
So no, there is no one definition. And so if people are starting out to try to make

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:42.960
a million dollars, a hundred million dollars, a billion dollars, you're going to fail.

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:49.040
There's a definition of personal success, but there's also some level of,

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:54.080
that's different from person to person, but there's also some level of

01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:01.360
the responsibility you have if there's a mission to have a positive impact on the world.

01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:04.160
So I'm not sure that Elon is happy.

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:08.080
No. In fact, I think if you focus on trying to have an impact on the world,

01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:09.760
I think you're going to end up deeply unhappy.

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:14.560
Does that matter? Why does your own personal happiness matter?

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:19.760
It may happen as a byproduct, but I think that you should strive to find your own

01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:25.840
personal happiness and then measure how that manifests as it relates to society and to other

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:31.920
people. But if the answer to those questions is zero, that doesn't make you less of a person.

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:36.480
No, a hundred percent. But then the other way, is there times when you need to sacrifice your own

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:41.760
personal happiness for a bigger thing that you've created.

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:47.280
Yeah. If you're in a position to do it, I think some folks are tested. Elon is probably the best

01:57:47.280 --> 01:58:01.040
example. And it must be really, really hard to be him. Really hard. I have enormous levels of

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:07.360
empathy and care for him. I really love him as a person because I just see

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:16.080
that it's not that fun. And he has these ways of being human that in his position,

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:21.840
I just think are so dear that I just hope he never loses them. Just a simple example,

01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:28.240
like two days ago, I don't know why, but I went on Twitter and I saw the perfume thing.

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.400
So I'm like, ah, fuck it. I'm just going to go buy some perfume. So I bought his perfume,

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:37.200
the burnt hair thing. And I emailed him the receipt and I'm like, all right, you got me for

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:43.520
a bottle. And he responded in like eight seconds and it was just a smiley face or whatever. Just

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:49.680
deeply normal things that you do amongst people that are just... So nobody sees that. You know

01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:55.440
what I mean? But he deserves for that stuff to be seen because the rest of his life is so brutally

01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:02.160
hard. He's just a normal guy that is just caught in this ultra mega vortex.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:11.440
Why do you think there's so few Elon's? It's an extremely lonely set of trade-offs

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:18.640
because to your point, if you get tested... So if you think about it again probabilistically,

01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:23.760
there's 8 billion people in the world. Maybe 50 of them get put in a position where they

01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:28.320
are building something of such colossal importance that they even have this choice.

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:35.200
And then of that 50, maybe 10 of them are put in a moment where they actually have to make a trade

01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:39.200
off. You're not going to be able to see your family. I'm making this up. You're not going to

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:43.120
be able to see your family. You're going to have to basically move into your factory. You're going

01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:48.880
to have to sleep on the floor. But here's the outcome, energy independence and resource abundance

01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:56.240
and a massive peace dividend. And then he says to himself, I don't know that he did because I've

01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:01.680
never had this... Yeah, you know what? That's worth it. And then you look at your kids and you're like,

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:07.120
I'm making this decision. I don't know how to explain that to you. You want to be in that

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:11.760
position? There's no amount of money where I would want to be in that position. So that takes an

02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:18.000
enormous fortitude and a moral compass that he has. And that's what I think people need to appreciate

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.960
about that guy. It's also on the first number you said, it's confusing that there's 50 people

02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:30.000
or 10 people that are put in the position to have that level of impact. It's unclear that

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:34.880
that has to be that way. It seems like there could be much more. There should be. There's definitely

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:42.400
people with the potential. But think about his journey. His mom had to leave a very

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.800
complicated environment, moved to Canada, moved to Toronto, a small apartment just north of Bay

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:53.600
and Bloor, if you've ever been to Toronto. I remember talking to her about this apartment.

02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:57.760
It's so crazy because I used to live around the corner from that place and raise these three kids

02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:03.120
and just have to... So how many people are going to start with those boundary conditions

02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:12.640
and really grind it out? It's just very few people in the end that will have the resiliency

02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:21.920
to stick it through where you don't give into the self-doubt. And so it's just a really hard

02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:26.480
set of boundary conditions where you can have 50 or 100 of these people. That's why they need to be

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:37.040
really appreciated. Yeah. Well, that's true for all humans that follow the threat of their passion

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:40.560
and do something beautiful in this world. That could be on a small scale or a big scale.

02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:47.280
Appreciation, that's a gift you give to the other person, but also a gift to yourself.

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:54.720
Somehow it becomes like this contagious thing. You are so right. My brain just lit up because

02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:03.360
yesterday I went to an investor day of my friend of mine, describe Brad Gerstner. And on the one

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:10.000
very reductive world, Brad and I are theoretically competitors, but we're not. He makes his own set

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.480
of decisions. I make my own set of decisions. We're both trying to do our own view of what

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:21.600
is good work in the world, but he's been profoundly successful. And it was really the first moment of

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:28.400
my adult life where I could sit in a moment like that and really be appreciative of his success

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:36.000
and not feel less than. And so a little selfishly for me, but mostly for him as well, I was so proud

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:41.040
to be in the room. That's my friend. That guy plays poker with me every Thursday. He is crushing it.

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:51.520
That's awesome. And it's a really amazing feeling. I mean, to linger on the trade-offs,

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.920
the complicated trade-offs with all of this, what's your take on work-life balance

02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:08.320
in a company that's trying to do big things? I think that you have to have some very, very strict

02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:15.600
boundaries, but otherwise I think balance is kind of dumb. It will make you limited.

02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:20.880
I think you need to immerse yourself in the problem, but you need to define that immersion

02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:29.680
with boundaries. So if you ask me, what does my process look like? It's monotonous and regimented,

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:36.000
but it's all the time except when it's not. And that's also monotonous and regimented.

02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:44.000
And I think that makes me very good at my craft because it gives me what I need

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:49.760
to stay connected to the problem without feeling resentful about the problem.

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:58.160
Which part? The monotonous all-in nature of it, or when you say hard boundaries, essentially

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.240
go all out until you stop and you don't stop often. I'm in a little bit of a quandary right now

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:12.480
because I'm trying to redefine my goals. And you're catching me in a moment where

02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:18.800
I have, even in these last few years of evolution, I think I've made some good progress,

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:26.000
but in one very specific way, I'm still very reptilian and I'm trying to let go.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:32.480
Which way is that exactly? In my business, it really gets reduced to what is your annual rate

02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:38.080
of compounding. That's my demarcation. Steph Curry and LeBron James, Michael Jordan, it's

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:46.560
how many points did you average, not just in a season, but over your career? And in their case,

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:53.440
to really be the greatest of all time, it's points, rebounds, assists, steals. There's all kinds of

02:04:53.440 --> 02:05:02.560
measures to be in that pantheon of being really, really good at your craft. And in my business,

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:08.320
it's very reductive. It's how well have you compounded. And if you look at all the heroes

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:20.560
that I have put on a pedestal in my mind, they've compounded at above 30% for a very long time,

02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:30.400
as have I. But now I feel like I really need to let go because I think I know how to do the basics

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:38.080
of my job. And if I had to summarize an investing challenge or investing, I think really when you

02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:43.040
first start out investing, you're a momentum person. You saw it in GameStop, just a bunch of

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:50.720
people aping each other. And then it goes from momentum to you start to think about cash flows,

02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:56.480
how much profit is this person going to make, whatever. So that's the evolution. This is the

02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:03.040
basic thing. This is a reasonably sophisticated way. Then a much smaller group of people think

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:09.440
about it in terms of macro geopolitics. But then a very finite few crack this special code,

02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:13.600
which is there's a philosophy, and it's the philosophy that creates the system.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:20.240
And I'm scratching at that furiously, but I cannot break through and I haven't broken

02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:25.280
through. And I know that in order to break through, I got to let go. So this is the journey

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:32.640
that I'm in as in my in my professional life. So it is an all consuming thing. But I'm always

02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:38.000
home for dinner. You know, we have very prescribed moments where we take vacation, the weekends,

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.960
you know, like if I can tell you about my week, if you're curious, but it's like,

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:47.440
I would love I would love to know your week. It's since it's regimented and monotonous.

02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:57.280
I woke up I wake up at 645. Get the kids go downstairs. We all have some form of,

02:06:57.280 --> 02:07:03.440
you know, not super healthy breakfast, I make a latte, I've become in and the latte is like,

02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:08.720
I have a machine, I measure the beans, you know, I make sure that the timer is such where I have

02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:13.920
to pull it for a certain specific ratio, you know, just so you know, 20 grams, I got to pull 30 grams

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:19.280
with the water and I got you know, I got to do it in 30 seconds, etc. So you're a coffee snob.

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:24.640
It helps me stay in rhythm. Sure. Before I used to have another machine, I just pushed a button.

02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:29.360
But then I would push the button religiously in the exact same way. You know what I mean?

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:37.120
Can I say actually, on on that topic, you know, the morning with kids can be a pretty stressful

02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:44.080
thing. Are you able to find sort of happiness? Is that also that morning is a source of happiness?

02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:54.960
It's great. My kids are lovely. They're maniacs. I just see, you know, and maybe I don't,

02:07:54.960 --> 02:08:00.400
I've never asked for your breakfast, but I'll just put my words. I see all of the things in moments

02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:10.080
where there was no compassion given to me. And so I just give them a ton of love and compassion.

02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:16.400
I have an infinite patience for my children, not for other kids. Yes, of course. So anyway,

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:26.080
so we have a breakfast thing. And then I go upstairs and I go, I change and I work out from

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:34.400
8 to 9. And that's like the first 15 minutes, I walk up on a steep incline, you know, 12 to 14%,

02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:42.000
you know, three and a half to four miles per hour walk. And then, you know, Monday's a push day,

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:51.440
Tuesday's front of the legs, Wednesday's pull, Thursday's back of the legs, 8 to 9. Monday,

02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:55.760
I always start, I talk to my therapist from 9 to 10. So as soon as I finish working out,

02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:05.120
I get on the phone and I talk to him. And it helps me lock in for the week. And I'm just

02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:10.480
talking about the past. And it's just helping me. The recent past?

02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:14.720
Usually, sometimes the recent past, but usually it's about the past past,

02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.800
something that I remember when I was a kid. Because that's the work about just loosening

02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:29.360
those knots, you know? So I put in that hour of work, respect that hour, then I'm in the office.

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:38.000
And then it's like, you know, I go until 12, 15, 12, 30, go home, have lunch, like a proper like,

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.520
go home, sit down, have lunch with Nat, talk, she leaves her work. And we talk, how are we doing?

02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:48.560
You know, just check in. Our youngest daughter will be there because she's one and she's making

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:54.800
a mess. And then I'll have another coffee. That's it, my limit for the day.

02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:55.760
Oh, no more caffeine.

02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.280
That's it. And then I go back to the office and I'll be there till six, seven sometimes.

02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:06.080
And I do that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,

02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:11.680
Friday, I'm allowed to have meetings. Wednesday, nothing, it's all reading, must be,

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:17.280
unless it's a complete emergency. It has to be kind of a full reading. And reading is a bunch of

02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:19.920
blogs, YouTube videos.

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:23.040
So no trying not to do any talking.

02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.040
No talking. It's like being in silence, being present, thinking about things.

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.240
By the way, how do you take notes? Do you have a sketch?

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.760
I have a pad and I write stuff down. Sometimes I go to my phone. I'm a little all over the place.

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:41.120
Sometimes I do Google Docs. I don't have, this is one thing I need to get better at actually.

02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:45.840
But typically what happens is I actually do a lot of thinking in my mind.

02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:51.920
And I'm sort of filing a lot of stuff away. And then it all spills out and then I have to write.

02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:56.560
And then that gives me a body of work that I can evaluate and think about.

02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:01.760
And then I usually put it away. And a lot of the time it goes nowhere.

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:05.440
But every now and then I come back to it and it just unlocks two or three things and I have a

02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:10.720
sense of how else I'm thinking about things. And then Friday at the end of the day, Nat and I

02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:16.960
talk to a couples therapist and that's about checking out properly. So it's like, okay,

02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:23.920
now it's like focusing. The weekend is family, being present, being aware.

02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:29.600
And if there's email, obviously. If I have to do meetings from time to time,

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:32.640
no problem. But there's boundaries.

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:40.240
Checking out properly. Oh man, that is so powerful. Just like officially transitioning.

02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:48.000
Yeah. So these are really important boundaries so that I can be immersed.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.080
And what that means is like, look, on a Saturday afternoon, on a random day,

02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:58.480
she'll be like, where's your mouth? And I'll be up in my room. And I've found a podcast talking

02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:04.720
about Desus, which is like ductal cancer in situ. Because I've been fascinated about breast cancer

02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:09.360
surgeries for a while and learning about that. And she's like, what are you doing? I'm like,

02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:13.680
listening to podcasts about Desus. And she's like, what's that? And I'm like,

02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:20.720
you know, ductal cancer in situ. And she's like, okay. And so I have time to continue to just

02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:26.560
constantly learning, learning, putting stuff in my memory banks to organize into something.

02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:33.600
And that's a week. But then in these fixed moments of time, phone down, everything down,

02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:39.120
we go on vacation, we go on a boat, we go to whatever where it's just us and the kids.

02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:44.400
Is there a structure when you're at work? Is there a structure to your day in terms of meetings,

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:47.840
in terms of South Side of Wednesday? You know, because you're-

02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:54.720
Have to keep meetings to less than 30 minutes. Have to. And oftentimes meetings can be as short

02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:59.760
as like 10 or 15 minutes, because then I'm just like, okay. Because I'm trying to reinforce

02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:08.080
that it's very rare that we all have something really important to say. And so the ritual that

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:13.920
becomes really valuable to get scale is not the ritual of meetings, but the ritual of respecting

02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:19.680
the collective time of the unit. And so it's like, you know what, folks, I'm going to assume that

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:24.240
you guys are also tackling really important projects. You also want to have good boundaries

02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:28.400
in this immersion, go back to your kids and have dinner with them every night. It's not just for

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:32.560
me, it's for you. So how about this? Why don't you go and do your work? This meeting didn't need to

02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:38.160
be 30 minutes, it could be five. And the rest of the time is yours. And it's weird because when

02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:43.840
people join that system at Social Capital, they just, it's like FaceTime and it's like, let me

02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:49.040
make sure and let me talk a lot. It's like, yeah, say anything. I respect the person that says

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:53.440
nothing for two years and the first thing that they say is not obvious. That person is immensely

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:58.320
more valuable than the person that tries to talk all the time. What have you learned from your- So

02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:03.360
after Facebook, you started Social Capital or what is now called Social Capital. What have you

02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:11.200
learned from all the successful investing you've done there? About investing or about life?

02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.080
Yeah.

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:13.280
Or about running a team?

02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:17.920
I'm very loathe to give advice because I think so much of it is situational, but

02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:24.880
my observation is that starting a business is really hard, any kind of business. And most people

02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:32.400
don't know what they're doing. And as a result, we make enormous mistakes. But I would summarize

02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.880
this, and this may be a little heterodoxical, I think there are only three kinds of mistakes.

02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:42.240
Because if we go back to what we said before, in the business, it's just learning. You're exploring

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:47.920
the dark space to get to the answer faster than other people. And those, the mistakes that you

02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:57.840
make are three, or the three kinds of decisions, let's say. You'll hire somebody, and they're

02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:05.200
really, really, really average, but they're a really good person. You'll hire somebody,

02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:12.960
and they really weren't candid with who they are. And their real personality and their morality

02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:20.000
and their ethics only expose them over a long period of time. And then you hire somebody,

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:28.400
and they're not that good, morally, but they're highly performant.

02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:36.800
What do you do with those three things? And I think successful companies have figured out

02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:44.400
how to answer those three things, because those are the things that, in my opinion,

02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:48.400
determine success and failure. So basically hiring, and you just identified

02:15:49.040 --> 02:15:53.760
three failure cases for hiring. But very different failure cases and very complicated ones, right?

02:15:53.760 --> 02:16:00.640
Like the highly performant person who's not that great as a human being, do you keep them around?

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:04.640
Well, a lot of people would err towards keeping that person around. What is the right answer? I

02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:11.280
don't know. It's the context of the situation. And the second one is also very tricky. What about

02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:14.640
if they really turned out that they were just not candid with who they are, and it took you a long

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:18.400
time to figure out who you were? These are all mistakes of the senior person that's running this

02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:26.560
organization. I think if you can learn to manage those situations well, those are the real edge

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:31.840
cases where you can make mistakes that are fatal to a company. That's what I've learned over 11

02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:39.760
and a half years, honestly. Otherwise, the business of investing, I feel that it's a secret.

02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:48.000
And if you are willing to just keep chipping away, you'll peel back enough of these. Layers will come

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.560
off and you'll see it. The scales will come off and you'll eventually see it. I really struggle

02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:57.360
with, maybe you can be my therapist for a little bit, with that first case which you originally

02:16:57.360 --> 02:17:04.640
mentioned, because I love people. I see the good in people. I really struggle with just a mediocre

02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:09.200
performing person who's a good human being. That's a tough one.

02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:16.400
I'll let you off the hook. I think those are incredibly important and useful people. I think

02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:23.280
that if a company is like a body, they are like cartilage. Can you replace cartilage? Yeah. But

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:28.400
would you if you didn't have to? No. Okay. Can I play devil's advocate?

02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:36.720
Yeah. Those folks, because of their goodness, make it okay to be mediocre.

02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:45.120
They create a culture where, well, what's important in life, which is something I agree

02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:50.320
in my personal life, is to be good to each other, to be friendly, to be good vibes,

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:55.280
all that kind of stuff. When I was at Google, just the good atmosphere, everyone's playing,

02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:05.840
it's fun. Fun, right? But to me, when I put on my hat of having a mission and a goal,

02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:16.240
what I love to see is the superstars that shine in some way, do something incredible. I want

02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:25.120
everyone to also admire those superstars, and perhaps not just for the productivity

02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:31.440
sake or performing or successful company sake, but because that, too, is an incredible thing

02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:36.720
that humans are able to accomplish, which is shine. I hear you, but that's not a decision you make,

02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:42.640
meaning you get lucky when you have those people in your company. That's not the hard part for you.

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:46.640
The hard part is figuring out what to do with one, two, and three. Keep,

02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:52.480
demote, promote, fire. What do you do? This is why it's all about those three buckets.

02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:58.240
I personally believe that folks in that bucket one, as long as those folks aren't more than

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:05.360
50% to 60% of a company, are good, and they can be managed as long as they are one to two degrees

02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:10.880
away from one of those people that you just mentioned. Because it's easy, then, to drag

02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:16.160
the entire company down if they're too far away from the LeBron James, because you don't know

02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:22.240
what LeBron James looks and feels and smells. So you need that tactile sense of what excellence

02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:27.280
looks like in front of you. A great example is if you just go on YouTube and you search these clips

02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:36.560
of how Kobe Bryant's teammates described, not Kobe, but how their own behavior, not performance,

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:39.920
because there was a bunch of average people that Kobe played with his whole career,

02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:47.360
but their behavior changed by being somewhat closer to him. And I think that's an important

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:53.280
psychological thing to note for how you can do reasonably good team construction. If you're

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:58.320
lucky enough to find those generational talents, you have to find a composition of a team that

02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:06.560
keeps them roughly close to enough of the org. That way, that group of people can continue to

02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:11.840
add value, and then you'll have courage to fire these next two groups of people. And I think the

02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:16.480
answer is to fire those two groups of people, because no matter how good you are, that stuff

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:22.960
just injects poison into a living organism, and that living organism will die when exposed to poison.

02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:28.480
So you've invested in a lot of companies. You've looked at a lot of companies. What do you think

02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:34.480
makes for a good leader? So we talked about building a team, but a good leader for a company. What

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:45.360
are the qualities? When I first meet people, I never ask to see a resume. And when I'm meeting

02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:52.400
a company CEO for the first time, I couldn't care less about the business, in fact. And I try to

02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:59.280
take the time to let them reveal themselves. Now, in this environment, I'm doing most of the talking,

02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:02.320
but if this were the other way around and you were ever raising capital and you said,

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:06.880
Schmoth, I'd be interested in you looking at this business, I'd probably say eight to ten words

02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:14.400
for hours. I'd just listen. Prod. I throw things out, prod, and I let you meander. And in you

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:21.120
meandering, I'm trying to build a sense of who this person is. Once I have a rough sense of that,

02:21:21.120 --> 02:21:28.000
which is not necessarily right, but it's a starting point, then I can go and understand why

02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:34.880
this idea makes sense in this moment. And what I'm really trying to do is just kind of unpack,

02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:41.280
where are the biases that may make you fail? And then we go back to you.

02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:47.520
The thing that Silicon Valley has the benefit of, though, is that they don't have to do any of this

02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:53.920
stuff if there's momentum, because then the rule book goes out the window and people clamor to

02:21:53.920 --> 02:22:00.720
invest. So one of the things that I do, and this is again back to this pugilism that I inflict on

02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:08.080
myself, is I have these two things that I look at. Thing number one is I have a table that says,

02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:13.200
how much should we make from all of our best investments? How much should we lose from all

02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:19.600
of our worst investments? What is the ratio of winners to losers over 11 years? And in our case,

02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:29.280
it's 23 to 1 on billions of dollars. So you can see a lot of signal. But what that allows me to do

02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:38.400
is really say, wait a minute. We cannot violate these rules around how much money we're willing

02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:45.520
to commit in an errant personality. The second is I ask myself, of all the other top VCs in

02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:52.800
Silicon Valley, name them all, what's our correlation? Meaning, when I do a deal,

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:57.040
how often does anybody from Sequoia, Excel, Benchmark, Kleiner, you name it,

02:22:57.840 --> 02:23:04.640
do it at the same time or after, and vice versa? And then I look at the data to see how much they

02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:11.040
do it amongst themselves. What's a good sign? I'm at zero, as virtually close to zero as possible.

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:14.800
And that's a good thing. Well, it's not a good thing when the

02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:21.840
markets are way, way up because it creates an enormous amount of momentum. So I have to make

02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:29.120
money the hard way because I'm trafficking in things that are highly uncorrelated to the

02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:34.720
gestalt of Silicon Valley, which can be a lonely business. But it's really valuable in moments

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:40.640
where markets get crushed because correlation is the first thing that causes massive destruction

02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:47.680
of capital, massive. Because one person all of a sudden with one blow up in one company, boom,

02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:54.720
the contagion hits everybody except the person that was not. And so now those are like more

02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:59.600
sophisticated elements of risk management, which is again, this pugilism that I inflict on mine.

02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:04.400
Nobody asks me to do that. Nobody actually at some level when the markets are up really care.

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:09.360
But when markets are sideways or when markets are down, I think that that allows me to feel

02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:16.720
proud of our process. But that requires you to think a lot outside of the box. It's lonely

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:23.040
because you're taking risks also your public personality. So you say stuff that if it's wrong,

02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:29.440
you get yelled at for constantly for being. I mean, your mistakes aren't private.

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:35.840
No. And that's something that has been a really, really healthy moment of growth.

02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:42.400
It's like an athlete. You know, if you really want to be a winner, you got to hit the shot

02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:49.440
in front of the fans. And if you miss it, you have to be willing to take the responsibility

02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:55.680
of the fact that you bricked it. And over time, hopefully, there's a body of work that says you've

02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.960
generally hit more than you've missed. But if you look at even the best shooters, what are they 52%?

02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:07.840
So these are razor thin margins at the end of the day, which is really so then what can you control?

02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:13.760
I can't control the defense. I can't control what they throw at me. I can just control my

02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:17.040
preparation and whether I'm in the best position to launch a reasonable shot.

02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:23.120
You said that the world's first trillionaire will be somebody in climate change in the past.

02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:29.840
Let's update that. What's today as we stand here today, what sector will the world's first

02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:32.720
trillionaire come from? Yeah, I think it's energy transition.

02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:37.360
So energy. So the things we've been talking about. Yeah. Really? So isn't it? Okay. Well,

02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:41.920
I think the way that I think about- So this is a single individual. Sorry to interrupt. You see

02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:48.160
their ability to actually build a company that makes a huge amount of money as opposed to this

02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:52.960
distributed idea that you've been talking about. Yeah, I'll give you my philosophy on wealth.

02:25:52.960 --> 02:26:03.200
Most of it is not you. An enormous amount of it is the genetic distribution of being born in the

02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:07.440
right place and blah, blah, blah, irrespective of the boundary conditions of how you were born

02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:13.200
or where you were raised. So at the end of the day, you and I ended up in the United States.

02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:21.360
It's a huge benefit to us. Second is the benefit of our age. It's much better and much more likely

02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:28.560
to be successful as a 46-year-old in 2023 than a 26-year-old in 2023. Because in my case,

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:34.800
I have demographics working for me. For the 26-year-old, he or she has demographics

02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:38.720
working slightly against them. Can you explain that a little bit? What are the demographics here?

02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:46.640
In the case of me, the distribution of population in America looks like a pyramid.

02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:54.480
And in that pyramid, I'm wedged in between these two massive population cohorts, the boomers and

02:26:54.480 --> 02:27:01.360
then these Gen Z and millennials. And that's a very advantageous position. It's not dissimilar

02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:07.200
to the position that Buffett was where he was packaged in between boomers beneath him and the

02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:13.600
silent generation above him. And being in between two massive population cohorts turns out to be

02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:19.520
extremely advantageous because when the cohort above you transitions power and capital and all

02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:24.480
of this stuff, you're the next person that likely gets handed it. So we have a disproportionate

02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:31.280
likelihood to be, you know, we are lucky to be older than younger. So that's an advantage.

02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:36.320
And then the other advantage that has nothing to do with me is that I stumbled into technology.

02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:39.920
I got a degree in electrical engineering and I ended up coming to Silicon Valley.

02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:44.320
And it turned out that in that moment, it was such a transformational wind of change

02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:54.720
that was at my back, right? So the wealth that one creates is a huge part of those variables.

02:27:55.280 --> 02:28:01.360
And then the last variable is your direct contributions in that moment. And the reason why

02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:11.680
that can create extreme wealth is because when those things come together at the right moment,

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:15.680
it's like a chemical reaction. I mean, it's just crazy. So

02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:23.040
that was sort of part number one of what I wanted to say. The second thing is when you look then

02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:27.440
inside of these systems where you have all these tailwinds, right? So in tech,

02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:33.440
I think I benefit from these three big tailwinds. If you build a company or are part of a company

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:41.040
or a part of a movement, your economic participation tends to be a direct byproduct

02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.560
of the actual value that that thing creates in the world.

02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:57.280
And the thing that that creates in the world will be bigger if it is not just an economic system,

02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.800
but it's like a philosophical system. It changes the way that governance happens. It changes the

02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:08.080
way that people think about all kinds of other things about their lives. So there's a reason,

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:15.120
I think, why database companies are worth X, social companies are worth Y, but the military

02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:22.880
industrial complex is worth as much. And I think there is a reason why that if you, for example,

02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:29.840
were to go off and build some newfangled source of energy that's clean and hyperabundant and safe,

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:36.480
that what you're really going to displace or reshape is trillions and trillions of dollars

02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:42.160
of worldwide GDP. So the global GDP is I call it 85 trillion, right? It's going at two to three

02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:49.280
percent a year. So in the next 10 years, we'll be dealing with $100 trillion of GDP, right? Somebody

02:29:49.280 --> 02:30:00.320
who develops clean energy in 2035 will probably shift 10% of that around, $10 trillion. A company

02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:08.640
can easily capture 30% of a market, $3 trillion. A human being can typically own a third of one

02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:14.640
of these companies, $1 trillion. So you can kind of get to this answer where it's like, it's going

02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:21.280
to happen in our lifetime. But you have to, I think, find these systems that are so gargantuan

02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:28.000
and they exist today. It's more bounded because price discovery takes longer. In an existing thing,

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:31.760
it's more unbounded because you know what it is. You know the tentacles that energy reaches,

02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:38.000
right? Of that $80 trillion of worldwide GDP, I bet you if you added up all the energy companies,

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.800
but then you added up all of manufacturing, you know, if you added up all of transport,

02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:48.480
you'd probably get to like 60 of the 80. Do you have an idea of which energy,

02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:55.360
which alternate energy, sustainable energy is the most promising? Well, I think that we

02:30:57.680 --> 02:31:03.680
have to do a better job of exploring what I call the suburbs of the periodic table.

02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:09.840
So, you know, we're really good in Seattle, you know, the upper Northwest. Yes. You know,

02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:15.200
we're kind of good in Portland, but we're non-existent in San Diego and we have zero

02:31:15.200 --> 02:31:23.440
plan for North Carolina through Florida. Is that a fancy way of saying nuclear should be part of

02:31:23.440 --> 02:31:30.160
the discussion? I think nuclear, I think room temperature semiconductors, I'm not convinced

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:34.800
right now that the existing set of nuclear solutions will do a good job of scaling beyond

02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:39.520
bench scale. I think there is a lot of complicated technical problems that make it work at a bench

02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:44.320
scale level, even partially, but the energy equation is going to be very difficult to

02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:50.560
overcome in the absence of some leaps in material science. Have you seen any leaps? Is there promising

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:55.520
stuff like you're seeing a cutting edge from a company perspective? Yeah. I would say not yet,

02:31:56.400 --> 02:32:02.720
but the precursor, yes. I have been spending a fair amount of time, so talking about like a new

02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:11.040
framework that's in my mind is around these room temp superconductors. And so I've been kind of

02:32:11.040 --> 02:32:17.280
bumbling around in that forest for about a year. I haven't really put together

02:32:18.080 --> 02:32:23.920
any meaningful perspectives, but again, talking about like trafficking in companies and investments

02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:29.600
that are very lonely, but they allow me to generate returns that are relatively unique

02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:33.520
and independent. That's an area where I don't see anybody else when I'm there.

02:32:33.520 --> 02:32:40.880
I'll give you another area. We, I think, are about to unleash in a world of zero energy and

02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:50.240
zero compute costs, computational biology will replace white chemistry. And when you do that,

02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:56.560
you will be able to iterate on tools that will be able to solve a lot of human disease.

02:32:57.520 --> 02:33:03.360
I think if you look at the head of the top 400 most recurring rare diseases,

02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:11.600
I think half the number, 200, is specific point mutation as just the mis-methylation between C

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:17.440
and T. I mean, that's like, whoa, wait, you're telling me in billions of lines of code. I

02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:21.920
forgot a semicolon right there. That's causing this whole thing to miscompile. So I just gotta

02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:27.760
go in there and boop, and it's all done. That's a crazy idea. That was a C++ C throwback for

02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:29.840
people that don't know what I said. There's two people who are clapping.

02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:33.680
Two people there. Everybody else is like, what? This is not a pipe. What are you talking about?

02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:39.600
Makes perfect sense. Couldn't that be a source of a huge,

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:43.760
the computational biology unlocks? I mean, obviously medicine is begging for-

02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:48.080
The thing with energy though is that the groundwork is well laid.

02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:55.280
Yeah. And talking about the upper bound is well-defined. The upper bound in medicine

02:33:55.280 --> 02:34:00.800
is not well-defined because it is not the sum total of the market cap of the pharma industries.

02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:03.360
It is actually the sum total of the value of human life.

02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:08.080
And that's an extremely ethical and moral question.

02:34:08.720 --> 02:34:15.120
Isn't there a special interest that are resisting moving, making progress on the energy side?

02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:19.200
So like governments and how do you break through that? I mean,

02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:20.880
you have to acknowledge the reality of that, right?

02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:24.560
I think it's less governments. In fact, like I said, I think President Biden has done

02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:27.920
a really incredible job. Well, Chuck Schumer really has done a really incredible job because,

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:34.720
so just to give you the math on this, right? Like back to this, so 3% of everything is of a market

02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:40.560
or zealots. But when you get past 5%, things tend to just go nuclear to 50, 60%.

02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:49.280
The way that they wrote this last bill, the cost, I'll just use the cars as an example. The cost of

02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:57.200
an average car is 22,500. The cost of the cheapest battery car is 30,000. And lo and behold, there's

02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:02.880
a $7,500 credit. And it's like to think the invisible hand didn't know that that math was

02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:08.400
right I think is kind of a little bit malarkey. And so the battery EV car is going to be the

02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:14.480
same price as the thing and it's going to go to 40, 50%. So we're already at this tipping point,

02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:20.480
so we're kind of ready to go. In these other markets, it's a little bit more complicated

02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:25.120
because there's a lot of infrastructure that needs to get built. So the gene editing thing,

02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:33.920
as an example, we have to build a tool chain that looks more like code that you can write to.

02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:40.800
Facebook has written in I think PHP originally, which I'm still a big fan of. Sometimes you have

02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:47.440
to use the ugly solution and make it look good versus trying to come up with a good solution,

02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:54.160
which will be too late. Let me ask you, you consider a run for governor of California,

02:35:54.160 --> 02:36:00.000
then decided against it. What went into each of these decisions? And broadly,

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:08.560
I just have maybe a selfish question about Silicon Valley. Is it over as a world leader

02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:17.760
for new tech companies as this beacon of promise of young minds stepping in and creating something

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:21.520
that changes the world? I don't know if those two questions are connected.

02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:28.000
So it's not over, but I think it's definitely we're in a challenging moment

02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:39.360
because... So back to that analogy of the demographics. If you bucket it, forget our

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:48.000
relative successes, but there's a bunch of us in this mid-50s to mid-30s cohort of people that have

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:55.400
now been around for 20 years, 15 years to 25 years that have done stuff. From Andreessen to

02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:02.760
Zuck to Jack Dorsey, et cetera, Elon, whatever, maybe you throw me in the mix, David Sachs,

02:37:02.760 --> 02:37:11.800
whatever. None of us have done a really good job of becoming a statesman or a stateswoman

02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:19.480
and really showing a broad empathy and awareness for the broader systems.

02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:24.600
So if Silicon Valley is to survive as a system, we need to know that we've transitioned from

02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.320
move fast and break things to get to the right answer and take your time, if that's what it

02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:35.480
means. And so we have to be a participant of the system. And I believe that. And I think that it's

02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:42.600
important to not be a dilettante and not be thumbing your face to Washington or not push

02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:47.640
the boundaries and say, you know, we'll deal with it after the fact, but to work with folks

02:37:47.880 --> 02:37:52.840
but to work with folks that are trying to do the best, again, steel man their point of view.

02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:59.800
Work with them, potentially run for office. So potentially like be, you know, understand the

02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:07.720
system. It makes me sad that there's no tech people or not many tech people in Congress and

02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:12.520
certainly not in the presidential level, not many governors or senators.

02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:17.640
Well, I think that we also have roughly, you know, our rules will never allow some of the

02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:21.560
best and brightest folks to run for president because of just the rules against it. But, you

02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:27.240
know, if- Oh, you mean- I mean, look, I think David Sacks would be an incredible presidential

02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:31.160
candidate. Now, I also think he'd be a great governor. No, he was born in South Africa.

02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:34.440
You know, I think he'd be a great governor. I think he'd be a great

02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:39.800
secretary of state. I mean, he'd be great at whatever he wanted to do. You know,

02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:46.280
Friedberg, you know, wasn't born here. So there's a lot of people that could contribute

02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:51.320
at different levels. And I hope that, by the way, the other thing I like about the pod is like,

02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:56.120
I also think it helps normalize tech a little bit because you just see like normal people

02:38:56.120 --> 02:39:02.520
dealing with normal situations. And I think that that's good. You know, it is a really normative

02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:07.560
place. It's not the caricature that it's made out to be, but there is a small virulent strain of

02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:12.680
people that make it caricature-like. Well, that's in one direction. What do you think about the whole

02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:21.080
culture of, I don't know if better terms, but woke activism? So sort of activism,

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:26.120
which in some context is a powerful and important thing, but infiltrating companies.

02:39:26.120 --> 02:39:30.840
I'll answer this in the context of Rene Girard. So like he says that people tend to copy each other.

02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:35.240
And then when they're copying each other, they're really what they're fighting, what they're doing

02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:41.800
is they're fighting over some scarce resource. And then you find a way to organize against,

02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:47.000
you know, the group of you against a person or a thing that you think is the actual cause of all

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.800
of this conflict, and you try to expel them. The thing that wokeism doesn't understand

02:39:52.920 --> 02:40:00.360
is that unless that person is truly to blame, the cycle just continues. And, you know, that was a

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:06.280
that was a framework that he developed that, you know, he's really conclusively proven to be true,

02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:13.480
and it's observable in humanity and life. So these movements, I think, the extreme left

02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:20.680
and the extreme right are trying to interpret a way to allow people to compete for some scarce

02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:27.800
resource. But I also think that in all of that, what they don't realize is that they can scapegoat

02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:33.240
whoever they want. But it's not going to work because the the bulwark of people in the middle

02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:40.040
realize that it's just not true. Yeah, they realize but they're still because in leadership

02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:46.360
positions, there's still momentum and they still scapegoat and they continue. And it seems to hurt

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.720
the actual well, it was much more successful in fairness, though, if you have to graph the

02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:57.480
effectiveness of that function, it's decaying rapidly. It's the least effective it's ever been.

02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:02.680
You're absolutely right. Being canceled five years ago was a huge deal. Today, I think it was

02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:08.040
Jordan Peterson on your podcast. He said, I've been canceled. And it was amazing. He said 38

02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:12.920
times or 40. He said some number, which was a ginormous number, a that he kept account of it

02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:17.400
and B was able to classify it. I'm like, what classifier is going on in his mind, where he's

02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:22.040
like, that's an attempt to cancel me, but this one is not. But my point is, well, it's clearly not

02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:26.920
working. And so the guy is still there. And the guy is, you know, putting his view out into the

02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:32.840
world. And so it's not what not to judge whether what he says is right or wrong. It's just to

02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:37.960
observe that this mechanism of mechanism of action is now weakened. But it's weakened because it's

02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:43.400
not the thing that people think is really to blame. Yeah, you've been canceled on a small

02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:48.440
scale a few times. So it's not sure didn't feel small. Actually wasn't small. I'm trying to

02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:56.200
minimize. Did that did that psychologically hurt you? Yeah, it was tough. I mean,

02:41:56.200 --> 02:42:01.160
in the moment, you don't know what's going on. But I would like to thank a certain CEO

02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:11.080
of a certain well known company. And he sent me basically like a step by step manual.

02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:23.320
No, no. And, and he was right. You know, the storm passed and life went on. Is it I don't know if you

02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:31.080
can share the list of steps, but is the fundamental core ideas that just life goes on? The core

02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:39.560
fundamental idea is like, you need to be willing and able to apologize for what is in your control,

02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:46.120
but not for other people's mistakes. Your mistakes, yes. And if you feel like there's something,

02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:53.560
then you should take accountability of that. But to apologize for somebody else for something that

02:42:53.560 --> 02:43:00.040
they want to hear isn't going to solve anything. Yeah, there's something about apologies. If you

02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:05.640
do them, they should be authentic to what you actually want to say versus what somebody else

02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:11.320
wants to hear. Otherwise, it doesn't ring true. Yeah, and people can see through that.

02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:15.480
And people can see through it. And also, what people see through is not just the fact that,

02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:19.640
you know, your apology was somewhat hollow, but also that this entire majority of people

02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.480
now walked away. The mob was like, okay, thanks. Yeah. And then people are like,

02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:29.240
oh, so you didn't care at all. This was like, and so then it reflects more poorly on them.

02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:36.280
Yeah. I know you said you don't like to give advice, but what advice would you give to a

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:43.160
young person? You've lived an incredible life from very humble beginnings, difficult childhood,

02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:46.040
and you're one of the most successful people in the world. So what advice,

02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:53.080
I mean, a lot of people look to you for inspiration. Kids in high school or early college,

02:43:53.080 --> 02:44:02.280
they're not doing good, or are trying to figure out basically what to do when they have complete

02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:05.480
doubt in themselves. What advice would you give them?

02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:18.440
It is really important that if somebody that you respect, and I'm going to just for the purpose

02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:24.360
of this, put myself in that bucket, and if you're listening to this, I wish somebody had told this

02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:36.360
to me. We are all equal, and you will fight this demon inside you that says you are less than

02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:41.880
a lot of other people for reasons that will be hard to see until you're much, much older.

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:51.960
And so you have to find either a set of people far, far away, like what I did, or one or two

02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:59.400
people really, really close to you, or maybe it's both that will remind you in key moments of your

02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:09.800
life that that is true. Otherwise, you will give in to that beast. And it's not the end of the world,

02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:15.640
and you'll recover from it. I've made a lot of mistakes, but it requires a lot of energy,

02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:23.080
and sometimes it's just easier to just stop and give up. So I think that if you're starting out

02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:26.920
in the world, if you've been lucky to have a wonderful life and you had wonderful parents,

02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:31.240
man, you should go and give them a huge hug because they did you such a service that

02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:37.000
most folks don't do to most kids, unfortunately. And it's not the fault of these parents,

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:43.160
it's not the fault of these parents, but it's just tough. Life is tough. So give them a kiss,

02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:48.360
and then figure out a way where you can just do work that validates you and where you feel

02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:52.920
like you're developing some kind of mastery. Who cares what anybody else thinks about it?

02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:56.520
Just do it because it feels good. Do it because you like to get good at something.

02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:03.960
But if you're not one of those lucky people, you can believe in your friends or you can just

02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:10.280
believe in me. I'm telling you, preserve optionality. How you do that is by regulating

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:19.000
your reactions to things. And your reactions are going to be largely guided in moments where

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.400
you think that you are not the same as everybody else, and specifically that you are less than

02:46:23.400 --> 02:46:30.680
those people and you're not. So just save this part of this podcast and just play it on a loop

02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:38.440
if you need to. But that is my biggest learning, is I am equal. I'm the same as all these other

02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:43.560
people. And you can imagine what that means to me to go out in the world, to see people and think,

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:48.760
okay, I'm the same as this person. I'm as good as them. And you could imagine what you're probably

02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:53.640
thinking of what I'm thinking is not that thing. You're probably thinking, man, this guy, yeah,

02:46:54.040 --> 02:47:00.280
I'm so much better. No, I am fighting this thing all the time.

02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:07.880
Well, I've also met a bunch of folks who I think is a counter reaction to that. Once they become

02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:14.680
successful, they start developing a philosophy that they are better, or even some people are

02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:20.520
better than others, which I understand, you know, there's LeBron James versus other people and so

02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:26.120
on. But I always really resisted that thought because I feel like it's a slippery slope.

02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:30.920
They're not better. They have mastery in a thing that they've fallen in love with.

02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:32.200
Yeah.

02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:37.960
I'm trying to develop mastery in a thing that I love. You know, I love investing. It's like

02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:44.440
solving puzzles. And I love that. I love trying to develop mastery in poker. I really love that.

02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:49.080
I'm learning how to be apparent to a teenager because I finally have one.

02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:55.960
It's all new stuff to me and I'm learning. That's what it's all about.

02:47:57.160 --> 02:48:01.320
Yeah. So you don't want to think you're lesser than and you don't want to think you're better

02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:04.360
than because those both lead you astray.

02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:10.200
I've never thought I was better than. I manifested better than because I was trying

02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:15.880
to compensate for feeling less than. My goal is just to feel like everybody else feels on the

02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:18.120
presumption that everybody had like a normal life.

02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:22.440
Given your nickname is The Dictator, do you trust yourself with power?

02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:26.440
If the world gave you absolute power for a month?

02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:34.600
No. No, because I think that I'm still riddled with bias. I don't deserve that position.

02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:42.760
And I would not want that weight on my shoulders. I had a spot actually where it was a very

02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:51.560
important and big poker game. And it was a spot where I was in the pot and it was a really large

02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:58.600
pot. It was like a million dollar pot. And I had to make a ruling and the ruling was in my favor.

02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:07.880
And I was just beside myself. I don't play. I play for the challenge. I like to get pushed

02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:14.120
to the limit of my capabilities. I want to see, can I think at the same level of these folks?

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.360
Because these guys are all experts. They're all pros. And I get enormous joy from that challenge.

02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:28.520
And I like to win, but I like to win just a small amount. You know what I mean? And then I never

02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:35.000
wanted to win in that way. But because it was my game, I had to make this call on a million

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:40.840
dollar pot and I wanted to just shoot myself. I just was like, this is gross and disgusting.

02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:48.920
And he was a complete gentleman, which made it even worse. So I do not want absolute power.

02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:52.920
Well, those are the people you do want to have power is the ones that don't want it,

02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:59.560
which is a weird system to have. Because then you in that kind of system, don't get the leaders

02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:05.400
that you should have. Because the ones that want power aren't the ones that should have power.

02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:10.120
It's a weird, weird system. What do you think? Let me sneak this question in there. What do

02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:17.800
you think is the meaning of life? Why are we here? You have to look up at the stars

02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:27.480
and think about the big why question. I think that it's a chance to just enjoy the ride.

02:50:27.480 --> 02:50:34.440
I don't think it really like, I don't believe in this idea of legacy that much.

02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:42.040
I think it's a real trap. So do you think you'll be forgotten by history? I hope so.

02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:46.920
I really, really hope so. Because if you think about it, there are two or three people that

02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:50.600
are remembered for positive things. And everybody else, it's all negative things.

02:50:51.160 --> 02:50:56.600
And the likelihood that you'll be remembered for a positive thing is harder and harder and harder.

02:50:56.600 --> 02:51:02.360
And so the surface area of being remembered is negative. And then the second, what will it matter?

02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:14.360
I'll be gone. I really just want to have fun, do my thing, learn, get better. But I want to reward

02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:22.600
myself by feeling like, wow, that was awesome. I've told this story many times. And I have put,

02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:30.200
again, my own narrative fallacy on top of this. But Steve Jobs' sister wrote this obit in the

02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:34.840
New York Times when he died. And she ends it by saying his last words were, oh, wow, oh, wow,

02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:40.520
oh, wow. That seems like an awesome way to die. You're surrounded by your friends and family.

02:51:40.520 --> 02:51:45.720
Not the fact that he died, obviously. But in a moment where what I read into it was your family

02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:52.440
was there. Maybe you thought about all the cool shit that you were able to do.

02:51:54.360 --> 02:52:00.200
And then you just started the simulation all over again. And so just on the off chance

02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:04.760
that that's true, I don't want to take this thing too seriously. You know what I mean?

02:52:04.760 --> 02:52:12.040
Just enjoy it. So you're not afraid of the end? No. Get in tomorrow. Get in right now.

02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:17.560
So every day you can go and you're happy. You're happy with the things you've done.

02:52:17.560 --> 02:52:21.320
Yeah. There are obviously things I want to do that I haven't done.

02:52:24.200 --> 02:52:29.400
But there are no gaping things. I've really, really, really been in love.

02:52:31.800 --> 02:52:38.600
Total gift. There have been moments where I've really, really felt like everybody else.

02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:45.640
There have been moments where I've had deep, deep, deep joy and connection with my children.

02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:50.040
There are moments where I've had incredible giggling fun with my friends.

02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:55.400
There's moments where I've been able to enjoy really incredible experiences, wine, food,

02:52:55.400 --> 02:53:01.960
all that stuff. Great. I mean, what more do you want? I could keep asking for more,

02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:09.560
but I would just be a really crappy human being at some point. You know what I mean? It's enough.

02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:17.640
It's enough. It's enough. This life is pretty beautiful if you allow yourself to see it.

02:53:17.640 --> 02:53:23.960
It's really great. And it's better than it's ever been for most of us, actually.

02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:25.880
Yeah. It's pretty nice.

02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:33.720
All of the millennials and Gen Zs, you're about to get a boatload of money from your parents.

02:53:36.120 --> 02:53:41.480
You better figure out how to be happy before you get that money.

02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:47.640
Because otherwise, you will be miserable.

02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:53.480
Get a lot of Dairy Queen. No, that only worked the first time.

02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:59.000
Two times in grade five and grade six. My God, that next year, Lex, I worked my ass off.

02:53:59.880 --> 02:54:03.880
But I could never bring myself to ask her. And then she did it. And I was like,

02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:07.080
man, this woman's a Miss Bruni. This woman's a gem.

02:54:07.080 --> 02:54:11.880
Yeah. But the third time, it faded. Isn't that the sad thing about life?

02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:21.320
The finiteness of it, the scarcity of it. Without that, ice cream wouldn't be so damn delicious.

02:54:21.320 --> 02:54:25.800
Chamath, you're an incredible human. I definitely recommend that people listen to you on all

02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:31.640
platforms. We're very lucky to be able to get your wisdom. I agree with,

02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:36.280
I've talked a lot about you with Andre Karpathy, who's somebody I really respect.

02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:42.440
And he just loves the shit out of you in how deeply you understand the world.

02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:43.160
That's a huge honor.

02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:44.200
He's an incredible human being.

02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:44.600
So that's-

02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:49.480
On a different, yeah, speaking of semicolons, there's some human beings that understand

02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:54.680
everything at the very low level and at the very high level. And those people are also

02:54:56.520 --> 02:55:02.440
very rare. So it's a huge honor and also a huge honor that you would be so kind to me,

02:55:02.440 --> 02:55:09.640
just like in subtle ways offline, that you would make me feel like I'm worthwhile.

02:55:09.640 --> 02:55:16.920
Can I just say something as just a layman listener? What you do, just so I could give

02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:26.280
you my version, is that you take things and people, so ideas and people, that are mostly

02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:37.000
behind a rope, and you demystify it. And what that does for all of us is it makes me feel like

02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:43.560
I can be a part of that. And that's a really inspiring thing, because you're not giving

02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:48.840
advice, you're not telling us how to solve the problem, but you're allowing it to be understood

02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:56.200
in a way that's really accessible. And then you're intellectually curious in ways that

02:55:57.080 --> 02:56:01.160
some of us would never expect that we were, and then you kind of end up in this rabbit hole.

02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:05.400
And then you have the courage to go and talk to people that are really all over the map.

02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:14.440
For example, when I saw your Jordan Peterson example, you went there, you talked about

02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:19.320
Nazism, and I was just like, man, this is a complicated argument these guys are going to

02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:26.600
tackle. It's really, really impressive. So I have an enormous amount of respect for what you do. I

02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:32.680
think it's very hard to do what you do so consistently. And so I look at you as somebody

02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:39.080
I respect, because it just shows somebody who's immersed in something and who's

02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:42.600
very special. So thank you for including me in this.

02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:46.680
I'm going to play that clip to myself privately over and over, just when I feel

02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:52.360
low and self-critical about myself. Thank you so much, brother. This is incredible.

02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:52.860
Thanks, man.

02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:58.920
Thank you for listening to this conversation with Chamath Palahapitiya. To support this podcast,

please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:10.440
Jonathan Swift. A wise person should have money in their head, but not in their heart.

02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:14.600
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
