WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
It wasn't just a one-on-one and it could be Steve

00:02.080 --> 00:05.800
against the team going, we need glass instead of plastic

00:05.800 --> 00:10.000
on the front face of the iPhone and we're going to do this.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
And we're like, God, you know, and so we did it.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details

00:17.000 --> 00:19.480
but he could see in our minds that we're like,

00:19.480 --> 00:22.040
yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,

00:22.040 --> 00:24.080
but man, it's really putting us at risk

00:24.080 --> 00:26.040
and we laid out the risks for him.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.320
And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.200
The following is a conversation with Tony Fidel,

00:32.200 --> 00:36.040
engineer and designer, co-creator of the iPod,

00:36.040 --> 00:39.440
the iPhone, and the Nest Thermostat.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.240
And he's the author of the new book, Build,

00:42.240 --> 00:46.240
an unorthodox guide to making things worth making.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.080
More than almost any human ever,

00:49.080 --> 00:51.960
he knows what it takes to create technology ideas,

00:51.960 --> 00:56.280
designs, products, and companies that revolutionize life

00:56.280 --> 00:59.120
for huge numbers of people in the world.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.880
So it truly is an honor and pleasure

01:01.880 --> 01:03.720
to sit down with Tony for a time

01:03.720 --> 01:06.480
and look back at one heck of an amazing life.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.520
This is the Lex Reuben podcast.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.680
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:11.680 --> 01:13.000
in the description.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.040
And now, dear friends, here's Tony Fidel.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.280
When did you first fall in love with computers

01:21.280 --> 01:23.560
or let's say computer engineering and design?

01:23.560 --> 01:28.560
I first fell in love with computers and programming

01:29.560 --> 01:34.440
was in a summer school class in fifth grade

01:34.440 --> 01:36.560
in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.600
It was a simple basic programming class,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.120
but the basic programming class

01:42.120 --> 01:44.680
was not like you might think it was.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.080
It was bubble cards.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.880
So literally it was the cards, the stack of cards,

01:50.880 --> 01:53.080
and you would use a number two pencil

01:53.080 --> 01:55.920
and you would put in your program line by line

01:55.920 --> 01:57.920
and you'd have to make sure it was perfectly stacked

01:57.920 --> 01:59.320
and no errors and what have you.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.920
And you would take that set of cards

02:00.920 --> 02:04.600
and you'd put it on this reader and it would go off

02:04.600 --> 02:08.480
to an IBM microcomputer somewhere in the,

02:08.480 --> 02:09.720
back then the cloud.

02:12.120 --> 02:15.520
And then you would sit on a Texas Instruments

02:15.520 --> 02:18.640
paper terminal and it would just,

02:18.640 --> 02:20.960
literally I was just, I could write things

02:20.960 --> 02:23.640
and I could program this machine to do stuff.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.840
And it was nowhere near sexy.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.520
There was no graphics, right?

02:27.520 --> 02:31.120
Oregon Trail was all in text, right?

02:31.120 --> 02:34.040
The cards were so cumbersome that if you got one thing wrong

02:34.040 --> 02:37.880
or out of order or a disaster or you dropped one card,

02:37.880 --> 02:39.520
it would all fall apart.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.080
So just doing that print F or what was it?

02:44.080 --> 02:45.440
I can't even remember what it was.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.920
It was what the basic commands were.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.800
Oh, so when you say basic, you mean basic programming?

02:50.800 --> 02:52.120
Programming language.

02:52.120 --> 02:52.960
Basic programming.

02:52.960 --> 02:57.520
So you're writing basic programming language on paper.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.560
On paper.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.080
And you're calling it programming though.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.200
It's called programming.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.160
Yeah, you're programming this computer in a remote location

03:05.160 --> 03:06.240
and it came back.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.720
So it was truly cloud computing in a way.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.320
It was really terminal based computing.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.080
And the input and the program are separate.

03:14.080 --> 03:17.040
So the input to the program or they can go together.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.400
Like, or there's no input to the program.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.360
It just runs and it gives you output.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.040
Yeah, it goes in and it says ready

03:25.040 --> 03:27.760
and then you can say run and then it would run.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.040
But to program it, you didn't type it

03:30.040 --> 03:31.520
because it was a printer terminal.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.840
You would make the stack of cards

03:32.840 --> 03:35.800
and that would get it into the computer's memory.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.000
Okay, so where was the magic?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.720
The magic was that you could create,

03:40.720 --> 03:42.360
you had a language and you could create

03:42.360 --> 03:43.800
what you wanted to create, right?

03:43.800 --> 03:46.120
You could create a world or what have you

03:46.120 --> 03:47.640
and have this interaction.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.080
And you could compute things, you could do numbers.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.000
I was playing Oregon Trail, right?

03:54.000 --> 03:54.840
So you're less like-

03:54.840 --> 03:56.760
So you can play video games.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.080
Wow, video.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.240
You could play text games

04:01.240 --> 04:03.440
and then imagine them in your brain, right?

04:04.600 --> 04:08.120
Oregon Trail, there's this meme I saw recently.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.840
If you want to feel bad about yourself as a programmer,

04:11.840 --> 04:16.440
realize that one person wrote Railroad Tycoon.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.800
I think that's the name of the game.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.240
It's this cool little builder game.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.840
One person wrote it in assembly.

04:22.840 --> 04:27.840
So like from scratch and for people who don't know,

04:29.360 --> 04:31.640
it kind of looks like a SimCity type game.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.080
It's a city builder, but obviously centered on railroads

04:35.080 --> 04:36.960
and there's a nice graphics of three dimension

04:36.960 --> 04:38.040
and all that kind of stuff.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.000
All the things, all the rich, colorful things

04:41.000 --> 04:43.840
you would imagine for a three dimensional video game

04:43.840 --> 04:45.360
all written in assembly,

04:45.360 --> 04:48.800
meaning the lowest level code next to binary,

04:48.800 --> 04:50.160
which is fascinating.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.560
And you had to notice the magic

04:53.560 --> 04:55.720
at that low level at that time.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.200
You didn't have all the graphics.

04:57.200 --> 05:02.120
You didn't have all the APIs and all the sample codes,

05:02.120 --> 05:04.480
no stack overflow, no internet, none of that.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.400
You just had to know registers.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.280
You had to know the op codes

05:08.280 --> 05:10.280
and you had to imagine the world in your brain

05:10.520 --> 05:12.200
with the memory structures and everything.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.320
There's no visualization.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.480
You visualized it all yourself, right?

05:15.480 --> 05:16.600
And so that was magic.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.080
But then the next part of the magic

05:18.080 --> 05:20.400
of where I got hooked even further

05:20.400 --> 05:22.520
was like I'm doing these little things.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.560
And then electronic arts came out for the Apple II.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.320
So I got an Apple II and electronic arts came out

05:28.320 --> 05:30.000
and I was programming and doing basic

05:30.000 --> 05:31.840
and making my own games.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.440
But then there were two games that really blew my mind.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.120
One was pinball construction set

05:38.040 --> 05:40.840
and the other one was music construction set.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.120
And these were both places

05:42.120 --> 05:44.000
where I could create pinball games

05:44.000 --> 05:46.240
and I could create musical scores

05:46.240 --> 05:49.320
because I love music and I could then play them, right?

05:49.320 --> 05:51.840
And so when you had that, you were like,

05:51.840 --> 05:54.360
oh, this is something very different.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.240
So I could create myself,

05:56.240 --> 05:58.600
but then there was others that create tools

05:58.600 --> 06:01.160
so you could create at a visual level.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.760
And then you would read the backstories

06:02.760 --> 06:04.720
because electronics arts back in the day,

06:04.760 --> 06:07.760
it was one programmer who would program those things,

06:07.760 --> 06:08.760
you know, each of those things.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.200
And you could read their backstories.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.240
It was literally like a musician or someone else.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.560
Like you could read Rick Rubin's like, here's the thing.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.800
They tell you all that stuff.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.800
And there was one guy who wrote music construction set.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.360
He wrote it all in assembly and he was 16 years old.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.200
Wow.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.920
And I was probably 12 or 13 at the time.

06:28.920 --> 06:33.040
And I went, oh my, if he was able to do this

06:33.040 --> 06:34.720
and had published, right?

06:34.720 --> 06:37.640
And this amazing tool was created.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.760
I'm like, what could I do?

06:38.760 --> 06:41.600
And so then it just kept building off of that.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.520
But really it was those seminal things,

06:43.520 --> 06:45.760
first the introduction and then the, you know,

06:45.760 --> 06:48.480
the power through programming and turning these things

06:48.480 --> 06:50.680
into what you wanted to turn it into.

06:50.680 --> 06:54.440
And you didn't have to be 40, 50 years old and have,

06:54.440 --> 06:55.440
you know, PhDs.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.680
And then I was like, okay, this is really cool.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.040
I wish we did that with programmers

07:01.040 --> 07:02.560
where we treated them like artists.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.280
We would know the backstory these days, today.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.560
What we do, not just programmers, engineers.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.000
Engineers, designers.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.360
Yeah, like all the things about a product

07:11.360 --> 07:14.400
that I think we love are the little details.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.960
And there's probably a human being behind

07:16.960 --> 07:20.840
each of those details that had their little inkling

07:20.840 --> 07:22.440
of genius that they put in.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.000
And I wish we knew those stories.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.680
That's always sad to me when I,

07:25.680 --> 07:28.080
because obviously I love engineering

07:28.080 --> 07:31.040
and I interact with companies and they, you know,

07:31.080 --> 07:33.160
autonomous vehicle is something I'm really interested about.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.760
And I see that companies generally,

07:35.760 --> 07:37.120
and we'll probably talk about this,

07:37.120 --> 07:39.480
but they seem to want to hide their engineers.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.760
Like engineers hold the secrets.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.640
Like the great secret.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.080
We do not speak of the great secret.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.600
But then the result of that is you don't get

07:50.600 --> 07:52.360
to hear their stories.

07:52.360 --> 07:56.200
The passion that is there behind the engineers.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.120
Like, and also the genius, the little,

07:59.120 --> 08:00.520
there's a difference between the stuff

08:00.520 --> 08:03.800
that's patented, like the kernel of the idea

08:03.800 --> 08:06.600
and the beautiful sort of side effects of the idea.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.240
And I wish companies revealed the beautiful side effects

08:09.240 --> 08:13.440
a little bit more, but sorry for the distraction.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.760
So what, you mentioned Apple II.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.680
What was the first computer you fell in love with?

08:18.680 --> 08:21.400
Like the product, the thing before you

08:21.400 --> 08:23.640
that was a personal computer?

08:23.640 --> 08:25.200
It was the Apple II.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.960
So the Apple II was something I was just lusting over.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.400
You know, it was, I think it was at the time

08:31.400 --> 08:33.960
it was the, you know, the person of the year.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.080
Maybe it was that year.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.960
I don't remember what, but.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.840
Well, Apple II was the person of the year?

08:38.840 --> 08:41.680
Yeah, for Time Magazine back in, I don't remember when,

08:41.680 --> 08:42.960
but it was around that same time.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.640
I was so young, but I had, there was the Apple II

08:46.640 --> 08:49.040
and I didn't know what it was, but I knew about tools.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.760
Cause my grandfather taught me all about tools

08:50.760 --> 08:53.800
and creating things, right?

08:53.800 --> 08:56.480
And I saw this thing and I had the, you know,

08:56.480 --> 08:59.200
that IBM experience, that terminal experience.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.560
And I'm like, oh, I could have that at home, right?

09:01.560 --> 09:03.080
And so I need to have that at home.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.880
And the only thing that was really talked about

09:04.880 --> 09:06.960
in our circles was the Apple II.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.880
And I was just like, that's it.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.240
So I went, jumped up and down.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.600
It was very expensive.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.440
I have to have this.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.480
My parents were like, what?

09:14.480 --> 09:19.240
You know, it was $2,500 back then in the 1981.

09:19.240 --> 09:20.960
It was like crazy, right?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.000
So I was like, I'm gonna make as much money

09:23.000 --> 09:23.920
as I can this summer.

09:23.960 --> 09:25.280
And my grandfather said,

09:25.280 --> 09:27.640
cause he helped me learn all about tools

09:27.640 --> 09:29.160
and build things together.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.840
I will match whatever you make

09:30.840 --> 09:32.240
so you can get this computer.

09:32.240 --> 09:36.680
So I worked very, very hard as a caddy, golf caddy.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.680
Cadding actually for the, you know, the families in,

09:39.680 --> 09:44.000
you know, at the country clubs in the town where we lived

09:44.000 --> 09:45.480
and did whatever I could.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.440
And that end of that summer was got my Apple II.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.280
And you couldn't tear it away from me.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.680
It was my friend.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.760
It was everything.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.680
From a product perspective,

09:54.680 --> 09:57.000
what do you remember that was brilliant?

09:58.360 --> 10:01.160
The design choices, the ideas behind it,

10:01.160 --> 10:02.800
or is it just that it exists?

10:02.800 --> 10:05.200
Or that very idea of a personal computer

10:05.200 --> 10:07.200
is the brilliant design choice?

10:07.200 --> 10:10.080
Yeah, it was that I could actually have this kind of tool

10:10.080 --> 10:12.960
in my house and I could use it anytime I wanted.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.320
I could program it anyways.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.720
There was no, you know, there was no internet connection.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.840
There was no, it was all just you.

10:18.840 --> 10:22.680
You either loaded software that you got from someone, right?

10:23.560 --> 10:24.400
Or you created it yourself.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.760
And then there was the whole other thing

10:25.760 --> 10:28.400
which was started happening, which we were doing.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.360
And this was kind of like MP3 and stuff.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.200
We were sharing software, right?

10:32.200 --> 10:34.240
So you built this community of sharing software.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.720
You would go and pirate.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.760
That was what it was called, pirate all this software.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.440
You never use it all, but it was just that fun thing of like,

10:40.440 --> 10:42.720
I'm gonna get all this other stuff and then tear it apart

10:42.720 --> 10:45.640
and do disassembly on it and see behind the scenes.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.560
So you really had a sense this was your world

10:48.560 --> 10:50.240
and you owned it, right?

10:50.240 --> 10:52.560
And you could like literally go into every register.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.200
We didn't have all those security layers like we do now.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.600
You could really touch bits and you could poke bits

10:57.600 --> 10:59.240
and you could make this light turn on.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.800
And the geek assignment just lit up.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.280
Now it's so abstract.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.640
People don't even understand.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.120
Usually some programs don't even understand memory.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.800
They just think it's unlimited, right?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.720
Yeah, and security.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.120
It's like now there's all this security that you should have

11:16.120 --> 11:19.200
but it's like the adults all showed up to the party

11:19.200 --> 11:20.880
and now you can't have all the fun.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.200
It's like, no, no.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.400
This was the thing where if the power went out,

11:26.400 --> 11:27.600
you lost your whole program.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.960
You might've worked a whole day on it.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.760
And if you didn't press save at every other line

11:31.760 --> 11:33.360
and you were to save, save, save,

11:33.360 --> 11:36.520
and it would like grr, the disk drive or the tape drive.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.640
Every single step was contemplated

11:41.640 --> 11:45.280
because if you didn't, you lost maybe a ton of work.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.520
So a lot of the magic was in the software.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.960
The fact that you could have software,

11:48.960 --> 11:51.840
the fact that you could share software

11:51.840 --> 11:53.880
in the community around the software.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.520
It wasn't necessarily the hardware.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.800
Well, that was the first step.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.840
The second step around the hardware

11:58.840 --> 12:01.240
was I got things like the mocking board,

12:01.240 --> 12:03.400
which the mocking board paired with the music

12:03.400 --> 12:05.880
instruction set, you could now generate all kinds of tones

12:05.880 --> 12:09.120
and notes and it was a synthesizer in the Apple II.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.040
So you would plug in this card and you go,

12:11.040 --> 12:12.080
oh my God, look at this.

12:12.080 --> 12:15.560
And it would, you could start generating cool sounds.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.960
You're like, it was a Moog, you know,

12:17.960 --> 12:20.320
like a Moog in a way, early Moog.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.760
What year are we talking about?

12:21.760 --> 12:25.840
This is 82, I think, 81, 82.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.520
And I bet you can make all the kind of synthetic sounds

12:28.520 --> 12:30.280
that are very cool in the 80s.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.680
Yeah, the eight bit, you know, chip tunes, right?

12:32.680 --> 12:34.320
Chip tune, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.000
And then, you know, when you wanted to add a joystick,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.280
you had to pull a chip out and you had to like plug

12:40.280 --> 12:42.560
in a dip socket to put in a joystick.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.960
And then I was like, oh, and then I had to get more memory.

12:44.960 --> 12:45.880
How do we do that?

12:45.880 --> 12:47.400
And I wanted to speed up product.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.960
So then that turned into a company, actually, from that.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.680
But it was in a hardware software, no one at that.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.960
But it was all about, you know,

12:55.960 --> 12:57.440
modifying this thing in every way.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.200
First was software and then you started gaining confidence

13:00.200 --> 13:01.920
and then I got a little bit more money and stuff

13:01.920 --> 13:03.400
and then you could get into the hardware

13:03.400 --> 13:05.160
and, you know, wire things.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.280
And then the Apple II came with all the schematics, right?

13:09.280 --> 13:12.560
So in the back, in the early Apple IIs,

13:12.560 --> 13:14.920
you could open up and all the schematics were there.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.080
You purchased the Apple II and the schematics come with it.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.600
Yeah, it came with it.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.400
That's an interesting choice.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.080
That's an interesting choice from a company perspective.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.600
Right, it was like a real maker kind of thing.

13:27.600 --> 13:32.600
Right, I wonder what they, so that was intentional.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.160
Like this is- Absolutely intentional.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.320
This is for the cutting edge folks too,

13:37.320 --> 13:38.160
or especially for the cutting edge.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.360
It was only the cutting edge, it was geeks for geeks.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.920
So we were like, oh, how did they make it?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.480
And then we got to learn through that.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.320
Apple I did the same thing, right?

13:46.320 --> 13:48.640
It just, Apple II became more packaged up

13:48.640 --> 13:52.040
and had, you know, a little bit better software, right?

13:52.040 --> 13:55.280
Came with basic and then, you know, so it was really,

13:55.280 --> 13:58.640
it was what we might think of as a raspberry pie today

13:58.640 --> 14:01.840
or something like that, but not with so much software.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.920
It was literally, and all the chips were out there

14:03.920 --> 14:06.080
so you could inspect the buses and the, right?

14:06.080 --> 14:08.320
Cause everything was just broken out.

14:08.320 --> 14:13.320
So I guess that's the idea behind stable big projects

14:13.800 --> 14:15.840
and open source, like on GitHub,

14:15.840 --> 14:20.480
that you have the schematics there and it's kind of a product,

14:20.480 --> 14:23.600
but I wonder why more companies don't do that kind of thing.

14:23.600 --> 14:28.600
Like we're going to release this to a small set of people,

14:29.080 --> 14:33.840
self-selected perhaps, that are kind of the makers,

14:33.840 --> 14:38.600
the cutting edge folks, the builders, the at home engineers.

14:38.600 --> 14:42.040
Like in some way what Tesla is doing

14:42.040 --> 14:45.840
with the beta for the full self-driving

14:45.840 --> 14:47.480
is kind of like that.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.960
It's like selecting a group of people,

14:48.960 --> 14:51.640
but that has to do more with you,

14:51.640 --> 14:53.120
how safe of a driver you are

14:53.120 --> 14:55.400
versus how much of a tinkerer you are

14:55.400 --> 14:56.840
because you don't get to tinker.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.960
I wonder, is that a crazy idea to do

14:59.960 --> 15:01.960
for really cutting edge technologies?

15:01.960 --> 15:05.480
Especially you're interested in like hardware stuff.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.840
Is that crazy?

15:06.840 --> 15:10.200
Why don't more companies do that kind of thing you think?

15:10.400 --> 15:13.560
I think back then it was about a community

15:13.560 --> 15:15.760
and serving that community of builders.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.120
Now this is about people who want to get the experience

15:19.120 --> 15:20.760
and want it really simple and easy.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.400
And they're like, and so there's the audience

15:24.400 --> 15:26.160
or they believe the audience is small

15:26.160 --> 15:27.720
who would value those other things

15:27.720 --> 15:29.080
that we're just talking about.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.960
But if we look at things like Raspberry Pi

15:30.960 --> 15:33.720
and all of these other little boards, right?

15:33.720 --> 15:36.880
There's a whole world more than I've seen.

15:37.160 --> 15:40.520
It's amazing what you can do now with these little kits

15:40.520 --> 15:43.000
and the software that's created.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.200
And so there's a whole nother,

15:45.200 --> 15:47.560
I think another batch of makers and builders

15:47.560 --> 15:49.120
that are coming up through the ranks.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.680
And if we look at YouTube channels and stuff, right?

15:51.680 --> 15:53.280
They take these little boards, they hack them,

15:53.280 --> 15:56.680
then they print out parts on their 3D printer,

15:56.680 --> 15:59.520
assemble them and they create robots and what have you.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.920
So I think it's happening.

16:01.920 --> 16:06.920
It's just not as raw as it used to be.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.880
But it's there and it's really expanding around the world.

16:11.880 --> 16:13.320
And that's really nice to see

16:13.320 --> 16:17.640
because it's a whole new generation who are empowered.

16:17.640 --> 16:21.240
I think there's a semi-dormant genius amongst millions.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.600
So like Raspberry Pi is revealing that a little bit.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.120
It's probably, I wouldn't be surprised

16:26.120 --> 16:28.320
if it's several million Raspberry Pis

16:28.320 --> 16:30.040
that have been sold and shipped.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.640
I think more than that.

16:32.360 --> 16:36.400
And it's kind of this quiet storm of genius,

16:36.400 --> 16:37.600
brewing of engineers.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.040
We don't get to hear it because they're not organized.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.280
I mean, we get to hear it through inklings here and there.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.760
Like I said, YouTube, there's little communities

16:44.760 --> 16:45.720
that are local and so on.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.200
But if they were organized,

16:49.880 --> 16:51.800
if a leader would emerge, no.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.040
Okay, so when did you first start to dream

16:55.040 --> 16:58.600
about building your own things,

16:58.600 --> 17:01.360
designing your own products,

17:01.360 --> 17:05.160
designing your own systems and software and hardware?

17:05.160 --> 17:09.120
Well, in high school, there was a company

17:09.120 --> 17:12.360
that a friend of mine founded

17:12.360 --> 17:13.600
and I was the second employee.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.720
It was called Quality Computers.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.800
And it was a mail order.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.440
Mail order, because there's no e-commerce then.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.800
There was no internet again.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.600
You either mailed in your little coupon

17:23.600 --> 17:25.320
and you said, this is what I wanted to order.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.840
Or you wrote in to get a catalog and delivered to you.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.840
Turnaround time and this stuff was like,

17:30.920 --> 17:32.600
from the time you wanted, the time you bought it

17:32.600 --> 17:34.560
was maybe eight to 12 weeks.

17:34.560 --> 17:37.440
That was just the normal way of getting things.

17:37.440 --> 17:42.440
So Quality Computers was a mail order for Apple II

17:42.480 --> 17:46.600
and it was software and all kinds of accessories.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.680
So hardware accessories.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.680
So hardware, plug-in cards, joysticks, all this stuff.

17:50.680 --> 17:55.680
And what we noticed was there were accelerator cutters

17:55.920 --> 17:57.640
or memory cards.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.680
And to be able to use those cards,

18:00.680 --> 18:03.800
you had to actually go and change the software you used

18:03.800 --> 18:05.480
to access this new memory.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.000
So you literally have to go and you took the program

18:08.000 --> 18:09.360
that you had, let's say it was Apple Works,

18:09.360 --> 18:11.320
which was like an early Microsoft office

18:11.320 --> 18:12.560
or something like that.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.920
And you had to literally change the code

18:15.920 --> 18:18.080
and you would install all these patches

18:18.080 --> 18:20.400
to then take advantage of the hardware.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.600
So what we started creating was software on top of it

18:23.600 --> 18:27.800
to do the automatic installation of all of these patches.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.560
So we made it much easier to take new hardware

18:31.400 --> 18:33.360
and the existing software you have

18:33.360 --> 18:35.360
and expand it into this new world.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.520
So it was creating tools

18:36.520 --> 18:38.280
and that really great customer support.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.960
And we started getting a lot of orders

18:40.960 --> 18:43.560
because we had the software make it easier to install

18:43.560 --> 18:45.480
to give them the superpower.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.120
And at the same time,

18:49.040 --> 18:50.800
they would be able to change their software

18:50.800 --> 18:53.160
and have a new world that wasn't existing

18:53.160 --> 18:56.440
from the companies that were creating the initial products.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.000
And so it was more of that.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.720
And then that happened with hard drives.

19:00.720 --> 19:04.600
So I wrote a hard drive optimizer for the Apple II

19:04.600 --> 19:07.400
to like read, because you could get really fragmented.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.840
So I wrote that piece of software

19:08.840 --> 19:10.080
and we sold that through the company

19:10.080 --> 19:12.960
along with the hard drives that we sold from third parties.

19:12.960 --> 19:17.200
So that all happened in 12th grade,

19:17.200 --> 19:18.680
freshman year of college.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.160
You wrote a hard drive optimizer in 12th grade

19:23.160 --> 19:24.560
for the Apple II.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.720
Between 12th and freshman year.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.440
What programming language, do you remember?

19:28.440 --> 19:29.280
Is that assembly?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.120
Is this, what is it?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.080
There were certain inner loops were assembly

19:32.080 --> 19:35.280
and other loops actually there were really early Pascal,

19:35.280 --> 19:39.560
no, CC compilers.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.440
What was the motivation behind these?

19:41.440 --> 19:43.800
Is it to make people's lives easier?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.680
Is it to create a thing, experience

19:45.680 --> 19:47.800
that is simpler and simpler and simpler,

19:47.800 --> 19:50.440
thereby more accessible to a larger number of people?

19:50.440 --> 19:52.960
Like what, or did you just like to tinker?

19:52.960 --> 19:54.440
No, no, no, it was two things really.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.480
Because one, we wanted to sell more hardware

19:56.480 --> 19:57.640
and software, right?

19:57.640 --> 19:59.920
So it was like, oh, make it easier for the user.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.080
And then the other thing was,

20:01.080 --> 20:03.760
because I was also manning the customer support line,

20:04.760 --> 20:06.600
people would call in and go, this doesn't work.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.120
And I'm like, oh, I gotta go fix the hardware and software.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.880
Or I gotta fix the software to make the hardware

20:10.880 --> 20:12.440
and the installation process better.

20:12.440 --> 20:16.000
So my whole world was out of box experience

20:16.000 --> 20:18.520
from when I was in high school.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.640
Because I had to man the customer support line,

20:20.640 --> 20:23.000
pack the boxes and write some of the code

20:23.000 --> 20:23.840
while we were doing,

20:23.840 --> 20:26.200
while Joe, Joe Gleason was the founder

20:26.200 --> 20:29.440
of Quality Computers, he was off doing the mark,

20:29.440 --> 20:32.360
the ads, placing the ads for the mail order,

20:32.360 --> 20:35.080
making sure we were running the credit cards, right?

20:35.080 --> 20:35.920
Yeah.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.360
It was two of us and then it turned into a third.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.000
And then we hired another person from high school

20:40.000 --> 20:41.760
to like pack boxes so I could stay

20:41.760 --> 20:44.560
on the customer support line or doing the software, right?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.160
And it was all in his parents' basement.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.000
Yeah.

20:47.000 --> 20:47.840
Right?

20:47.840 --> 20:50.320
As you were scaling exponentially.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.160
Scaling, right?

20:51.160 --> 20:52.000
Yeah.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.840
Exactly, bootstrapping.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.400
So we'll jump around a little bit,

20:54.400 --> 20:56.480
but what were the, you said you love music.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.720
What were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod

20:59.720 --> 21:01.120
if we jump forward?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.800
And how far back do those ideas stretch?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.560
If you look at the history of technology,

21:11.280 --> 21:14.600
there's, I mean, not just the product,

21:14.600 --> 21:17.960
but the idea is truly revolutionary.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.240
Maybe it's time has come,

21:21.240 --> 21:25.760
but just if you look at the arc of history,

21:25.760 --> 21:29.600
sort of music is so fundamental to who we are

21:29.600 --> 21:30.440
as a humanity.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.280
Right.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.160
And to be able to put that in your pocket,

21:34.160 --> 21:36.560
make it truly portable is fascinating

21:36.560 --> 21:40.200
in a way that's truly portable.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.040
So it's digital as opposed to sort of like a Walkman

21:44.040 --> 21:45.160
or something like that.

21:45.160 --> 21:49.760
So what were the ideas that gave birth to the iPod?

21:50.200 --> 21:53.040
I was in love with music since I was a kid.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.760
Just loved music from, I think, second grade

21:55.760 --> 21:58.160
when I got my first albums and stuff like that.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.680
What kind of music are we talking about?

21:59.680 --> 22:04.000
So this was Led Zeppelin,

22:04.000 --> 22:08.080
this was the Stones, Hendrix, Aerosmith,

22:10.680 --> 22:14.120
Cheap Trick, Styx, Ted Nugent,

22:14.120 --> 22:19.120
just the real American, and British rock and roll, right?

22:19.200 --> 22:20.640
There's a bunch of people listening right now.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.160
Who, Ted, who's that?

22:22.160 --> 22:23.000
Who's that?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.080
Led Zeppelin, what is that?

22:24.080 --> 22:24.920
Is that okay?

22:24.920 --> 22:25.760
Oh yeah.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.600
Yeah.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.960
Um.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.480
It drove my parents crazy.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.320
Yeah.

22:30.320 --> 22:31.720
Just blasted loud.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.960
Loud, just raw.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.160
And this was second, third grade, fourth grade,

22:35.160 --> 22:36.200
I just fell in love.

22:36.200 --> 22:40.600
And then we moved back to Detroit

22:40.600 --> 22:43.080
and I love listening to the radio station

22:43.080 --> 22:45.040
because there was all kinds of crazy music

22:45.040 --> 22:47.440
because you'd have an amalgam of rock

22:47.440 --> 22:48.800
and then funk and R&B.

22:49.480 --> 22:50.400
And I loved to listen at night,

22:50.400 --> 22:51.760
so I had a clock radio.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.720
But if I had the clock radio on,

22:54.720 --> 22:56.600
everyone, parents would go,

22:56.600 --> 22:58.840
go to sleep, stop that, turn that stuff off.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.360
So I hacked the clock radio

23:00.360 --> 23:02.320
and put a headphone jack in it.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.760
Nice.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.840
Right, so I said, oh they're like,

23:05.840 --> 23:07.160
okay.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.240
And then I could listen to it all night

23:09.240 --> 23:10.440
and no one could hear me, right?

23:10.440 --> 23:12.320
And I could just sit there and, you know.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.920
Just huddling around the radio.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.760
Groove out.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.800
Just listening to Zeppelin.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.600
There we're to heaven.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.840
What would you say is the greatest classic rock song

23:21.840 --> 23:23.080
of all time?

23:23.080 --> 23:25.560
Greatest classic rock song of all time?

23:25.560 --> 23:26.560
Well, pops into mind.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.760
Well, no, you know what?

23:27.760 --> 23:29.600
I mean, this has to be objectively number one.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.440
That's really hard, dude.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.280
This is so hard.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.120
No, you have to.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.640
This is a serious journalistic interview.

23:34.640 --> 23:35.920
You're not going to back down

23:35.920 --> 23:37.040
from these kinds of questions.

23:37.040 --> 23:37.920
Oh my God.

23:37.920 --> 23:38.760
No, I don't know.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.600
It's a challenge.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.880
Yeah, it's hard to pick.

23:40.880 --> 23:45.680
But to me, Stairway to Heaven is a safe fall.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.880
It's like, it's so often considered

23:47.880 --> 23:49.680
to be one of the greatest songs of all time

23:49.680 --> 23:51.720
that you almost don't want to pick it.

23:51.720 --> 23:52.560
Right, exactly.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.480
But you've returned to it time and time again.

23:54.480 --> 23:58.160
And it's like, yeah, this is something pretty special.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.760
This is a rock opera of sorts.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.200
Well, the rock opera that really blew me away

24:03.200 --> 24:04.760
and still continues to blow me away

24:04.760 --> 24:07.280
is all of Dark Side of the Moon.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.520
Like that.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.040
I love Zeppelin.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.160
I can't say which one's better.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.920
But Dark Side of the Moon for me was,

24:13.920 --> 24:16.840
it was a, you know, audio experience, right?

24:16.840 --> 24:18.240
The whole thing from soup to nuts,

24:18.240 --> 24:21.360
plus all the synthesizers, all of those things.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.800
Okay, so back to the iPod.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.560
So that's, from the early age, you loved music.

24:26.560 --> 24:27.560
Loved it.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.400
Absolutely loved it.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.520
And, you know, always was just around it

24:30.520 --> 24:33.080
and always, I just, it was always playing.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.360
You know, I played it so loud

24:36.360 --> 24:39.680
that I actually hurt the earring in my right ear.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.680
And I still suffer from that today.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.960
And then-

24:42.960 --> 24:43.800
No regrets.

24:43.800 --> 24:44.920
No regrets whatsoever.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.520
Going to concerts in downtown Detroit

24:47.520 --> 24:48.360
and all the crazy stuff.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.680
So moving forward.

24:50.960 --> 24:55.000
So in college, I was a DJ.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.680
So I would DJ and hang out and play all the tunes I love

24:58.680 --> 25:01.080
and whatever for the crowd.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.680
And then I continued to do that in Silicon Valley

25:03.680 --> 25:06.800
when I moved right after school.

25:06.800 --> 25:10.240
And so I was be lugging all of these CDs around with me.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.360
A thousand CDs to write.

25:13.320 --> 25:16.760
And at the same time, and so those were heavy.

25:16.760 --> 25:20.320
And at the same time I was doing the Phillips Nino and Velo.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.960
Those are Windows CE based mobile computing products.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.000
Nino was the first device

25:28.000 --> 25:30.440
to actually put Audible books on tape.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.440
So I worked with Audible, we met in a conference

25:33.440 --> 25:35.120
and they were like, we don't want to do hardware.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.160
We just want to do content.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.880
I was like, well, we have this device.

25:37.880 --> 25:39.560
Let's get it together.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.080
And we got Audible on that.

25:41.120 --> 25:46.120
And this was in 96 or seven, first Audible books.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.440
And it was, I was, oh my God, that's audio.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.400
Well, what if we put music on it, right?

25:52.400 --> 25:56.200
And so, and the memory was very small at the time, right?

25:56.200 --> 25:57.840
There was almost no flash.

25:57.840 --> 25:58.680
It was all DRAM.

25:58.680 --> 26:03.120
When you did Audible, you stored it in DRAM, right?

26:03.120 --> 26:04.800
Which is okay probably,

26:04.800 --> 26:09.800
because how much books do you need is the idea.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.000
By the way, brilliant, I mean, just putting books.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.680
I know it's probably not the sexiest of things,

26:15.680 --> 26:20.680
but putting books on a mobile device is a brilliant step.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.400
I don't know, sometimes you can't measure

26:25.400 --> 26:29.160
how much human progress occurred because of an invention.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.120
Like there's the sexy big products, but you never know.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.400
Like Wikipedia is one of those things

26:34.400 --> 26:36.720
that doesn't get enough, I think,

26:36.720 --> 26:39.760
credit for the transformational effects it has.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.840
It's not seen as the sexiest of products,

26:42.840 --> 26:43.840
but maybe it is.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.800
When you look at human history,

26:45.800 --> 26:49.360
Wikipedia arguably is one of the big things

26:49.360 --> 26:53.400
that basically unlocked human knowledge.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.400
Human knowledge, and human editing,

26:55.400 --> 27:00.120
and just the human nature of building something together.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.200
Yeah, so it's fascinating.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.680
Sometimes you can't measure those things,

27:03.680 --> 27:05.560
maybe until many, many decades later.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.120
Anyway, sorry, so that was in the Nino,

27:08.400 --> 27:10.640
that was there, and then there was Audible,

27:10.640 --> 27:14.000
they put books, why not put music?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.640
And I'm carrying around the music for the DJ gigs,

27:16.640 --> 27:19.440
and you're like, wait a second, two and two together, right?

27:19.440 --> 27:23.160
Like, let's get rid of this, and so, and then MP3 show up.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.040
The actual, like, encoded?

27:25.040 --> 27:29.280
The format, MP3 showed up around 97, 98.

27:29.280 --> 27:33.240
So MP3 is compressed so you can have,

27:34.120 --> 27:35.840
like the storage is reduced significantly.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.600
Right, so you could go from a large, full, full,

27:39.600 --> 27:44.520
lossless digital track into something

27:44.520 --> 27:47.760
that can be stored in four to eight megabytes,

27:47.760 --> 27:49.160
something like that for the audio.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.320
Now, that's a reduced quality,

27:51.320 --> 27:54.200
but you could get it down there, and you're like, oh, okay.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.520
And now, if we have enough flash or DRAM,

27:56.520 --> 28:00.480
we can put 10, 15, what have you, all in that same memory,

28:00.480 --> 28:02.840
and it starts to replicate a CD,

28:02.840 --> 28:05.080
and then ultimately, if you put it on a hard drive,

28:05.080 --> 28:07.760
you could start to put thousands of songs.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.440
Yeah, that's also another brilliant invention.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.880
People don't realize, I think people would be surprised

28:13.880 --> 28:17.760
how big, in terms of storage, raw audio is,

28:17.760 --> 28:20.560
and the fact that you can compress it, like,

28:22.760 --> 28:24.040
I don't know what the compression is,

28:24.040 --> 28:26.840
but it's like 10X, it's a very significant compression,

28:26.840 --> 28:29.720
and still, it sounds almost lossless.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.720
Much to the chagrin of Neil Young,

28:31.720 --> 28:33.880
who does not like that.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.440
But even Neil Young, even the stuff he talks about

28:37.440 --> 28:40.760
is still tiny files relative to the raw.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.720
So he wants us to increase it just a little bit more,

28:43.720 --> 28:46.880
a little bit more, but it's still, that's an invention.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.440
That's a thing that unlocks your ability

28:49.440 --> 28:52.400
to carry around a device like a Nino and listen to music,

28:52.400 --> 28:53.920
because without that, there's no way

28:53.920 --> 28:56.320
you can carry it on a gigantic hard drive.

28:56.320 --> 29:00.840
Right, exactly, and so then that, so it was MP3s,

29:01.320 --> 29:05.840
and my hatred of carrying around all this heavy stuff

29:05.840 --> 29:09.280
that then spawned, you know, fuse,

29:09.280 --> 29:13.160
and then ultimately, you know, became a lot of that,

29:13.160 --> 29:15.680
the ideas and things of that nature were,

29:15.680 --> 29:19.080
and my passions were born into then the iPod.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.520
You know, it was too, Apple needed something,

29:21.520 --> 29:23.120
and I wanted to fix something,

29:23.120 --> 29:25.720
and it all kinda, you know, came together

29:25.720 --> 29:27.200
at this right place, right time,

29:27.200 --> 29:29.080
plus the right technology came at this.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.440
It was just like, the stars aligned.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.520
So how did it come to life?

29:33.520 --> 29:38.520
The details of the stars aligning with the actual design,

29:39.280 --> 29:42.920
the actual engineering of getting a device to be small,

29:42.920 --> 29:47.920
the storage, you know, the interface, how it looks,

29:49.160 --> 29:51.440
the storage, the details of the software,

29:51.440 --> 29:52.520
all that kinda stuff.

29:52.520 --> 29:57.080
What are some interesting memories from that design process?

29:57.080 --> 30:02.080
What are some wisdoms you can impart from that process?

30:03.280 --> 30:05.800
Well, you know, how long do you wanna go?

30:05.800 --> 30:08.520
Cause I have, I can go deep, so.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.400
Let's go at least 20 hours.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.240
Let's go.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.080
Okay, 20 hours.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.880
This is one of the lengthy documentaries.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.000
We're gonna turn it into episodic, you know,

30:17.000 --> 30:17.840
binge listening.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.160
On Netflix, yeah, Game of Thrones.

30:20.160 --> 30:23.120
So let's just start with, you know,

30:23.120 --> 30:24.720
after I was asked to be a consultant

30:24.720 --> 30:26.400
to put this thing together.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.640
So I already had knowledge of, you know,

30:28.640 --> 30:31.080
the space and the technology and all that stuff.

30:31.080 --> 30:34.720
But I had to very quickly, and a lot of the suppliers,

30:34.720 --> 30:36.120
because of what I was doing at Fuse,

30:36.120 --> 30:37.320
trying to create that thing.

30:37.320 --> 30:42.320
So as a contractor, I was like, okay,

30:42.440 --> 30:43.680
what is the first thing you need to do?

30:43.680 --> 30:48.560
So after I showed a, you know, different architectures

30:48.560 --> 30:51.520
and what three different products could be to Steve

30:51.520 --> 30:54.720
about options for storage options, battery options,

30:54.720 --> 30:56.280
form factor options,

30:57.160 --> 30:58.000
there was three options.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.040
And as I was, was I told, given very good advice,

31:02.040 --> 31:04.560
give to the, the two options you really do not like,

31:04.560 --> 31:06.560
but there are options and give the best option last.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.520
Cause Steve will shut, you know, shoot all those down

31:08.520 --> 31:10.480
and give the best option last.

31:10.480 --> 31:11.880
And then you could talk about that.

31:11.880 --> 31:16.880
And so that was the one that had a 1.8 inch hard drive

31:18.800 --> 31:20.920
and a small screen.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.680
Like the screen, you know it,

31:23.680 --> 31:26.840
and the original iPod, classic iPod.

31:26.840 --> 31:31.680
And then I had enough of the idea of the three or four

31:31.680 --> 31:36.680
different CPUs and processor suppliers and kind of systems

31:37.080 --> 31:39.120
that were out there that I had gone and found

31:39.120 --> 31:42.520
and put together on power supplies, you know,

31:42.520 --> 31:45.440
disk drive interfaces, firewire interface, all that stuff.

31:45.440 --> 31:49.200
So I put together all of those schematics or, you know,

31:49.200 --> 31:50.680
block diagrams, they weren't schematics yet,

31:50.680 --> 31:52.000
cause it was just me.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.720
And coming up with a bill of materials,

31:54.720 --> 31:56.280
coming up with what it could look like,

31:56.280 --> 31:58.280
what would be the input output,

31:58.280 --> 32:01.560
how we could make a better headphone jack.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.760
That was also on there.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.160
Screen suppliers, tearing apart calculators.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.360
So got all calculators and all kinds of electronics

32:09.360 --> 32:14.360
to get the right size, different sizes of small LCDs.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.360
So I got all kinds of different battery types.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.280
I got different types of, you know,

32:19.320 --> 32:22.360
different battery sizes, double A's, triple A's,

32:22.360 --> 32:24.240
working through all the different,

32:24.240 --> 32:26.160
and there was lithium ion, nickel metal hydrate.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.840
So I took all the battery types.

32:27.840 --> 32:31.880
I took all of the memory types, processing types,

32:31.880 --> 32:36.880
LCD types, and connectivity and all that stuff,

32:38.200 --> 32:40.120
not wireless, but wired,

32:40.120 --> 32:43.960
and laid out these things as Lego blocks.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.240
So literally had all of these things as just,

32:46.240 --> 32:48.840
and so it made them so I could like, you know,

32:49.320 --> 32:50.240
put them together and figure out

32:50.240 --> 32:52.880
what the compact form factor would be.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.320
Oh, like how do we shove them together?

32:55.320 --> 32:57.360
What's the smallest possible box you can get?

32:57.360 --> 33:01.200
So the questions was on storage, so the hard drive,

33:01.200 --> 33:06.000
batteries, double A, triple A, screens,

33:06.000 --> 33:07.760
so screen size, and then for that,

33:07.760 --> 33:09.960
you're tearing apart calculators.

33:09.960 --> 33:11.640
Calculators, digital cameras, whatever,

33:11.640 --> 33:13.080
and getting little things, right?

33:13.080 --> 33:14.760
So you can make it physical, right?

33:14.760 --> 33:17.040
If you can make the intangible tangible,

33:17.440 --> 33:19.200
and so I can say, look, we can make this,

33:19.200 --> 33:21.560
and I brought this whole bag of goods,

33:21.560 --> 33:23.560
and it's like, ch-ch-ch, right?

33:23.560 --> 33:25.200
And like, here's this, here's this.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.960
This is why double A's won't work,

33:26.960 --> 33:28.520
and because it makes it too fat and everything.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.320
So just educate everybody through,

33:30.320 --> 33:32.360
here's the parts that we can use.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.000
It's a not sheet of paper, it's physical.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.320
You're playing in the physical space.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.680
Oh, I would go back and forth.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.760
So truth be told,

33:38.760 --> 33:40.960
because there weren't a good enough graphical tools

33:40.960 --> 33:45.960
on the Mac, I was using a PC with Vizio and some 3D tools,

33:46.320 --> 33:47.920
and I was doing 3D design.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.760
At the same time, I was taking all these physical parts

33:50.760 --> 33:52.160
and going, okay, what feels right?

33:52.160 --> 33:55.360
So because you have to go from the details,

33:55.360 --> 33:56.200
and then the rough,

33:56.200 --> 33:58.280
and you go back and forth, and you iterate, right?

33:58.280 --> 34:00.200
And so it was just a lot of fun,

34:00.200 --> 34:03.080
and then it ultimately ended up with a styrofoam model

34:03.080 --> 34:05.320
and printouts that came from Vizio

34:05.320 --> 34:07.000
that I glued together

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
and put my grandfather's fishing weights in,

34:09.000 --> 34:11.640
because I also modeled the weights, right?

34:11.640 --> 34:13.800
So I said, oh, this is this many ounces,

34:13.800 --> 34:15.600
this is this many ounces in grams,

34:16.240 --> 34:17.080
and then I went and got all that

34:17.080 --> 34:21.280
and weighted these styrofoam models

34:21.280 --> 34:23.440
to then match that so when you picked it up,

34:23.440 --> 34:25.520
it felt more or less form factor right,

34:25.520 --> 34:27.680
and it also, you felt how much,

34:27.680 --> 34:29.640
you know, was it gonna be dense enough?

34:29.640 --> 34:34.120
Is it gonna feel solid and rigid in your hand, right?

34:34.120 --> 34:36.040
Why does it need to feel rigid?

34:36.040 --> 34:37.720
Because it has to feel substantial.

34:37.720 --> 34:41.600
It has to feel like I have a bar of gold in my hand, right?

34:41.600 --> 34:43.440
You know, maybe you know this,

34:43.440 --> 34:45.520
when you open and close a car door,

34:46.440 --> 34:47.280
you know that thunk and you go bam,

34:47.280 --> 34:49.320
and you go, that feels solid, that feels real,

34:49.320 --> 34:52.320
and then you get this tinny car that's like ding,

34:52.320 --> 34:54.440
and you're like, does this feel safe?

34:54.440 --> 34:55.960
Does this feel like a value?

34:55.960 --> 34:58.320
And so when you have a device like that

34:58.320 --> 35:00.960
and you wanna make sure that there's not too much air in it,

35:00.960 --> 35:04.760
that you distributed the density of the masses

35:04.760 --> 35:07.480
in the right way, so it feels like it's the right thing.

35:07.480 --> 35:12.480
So you have to model battery life, costs, you know,

35:13.000 --> 35:16.080
mass, sizes of different things,

35:16.080 --> 35:17.360
and then you have to also think about

35:17.360 --> 35:19.040
what the UI is gonna look like, right?

35:19.040 --> 35:21.120
So you have all of these constraints you're working,

35:21.120 --> 35:22.520
variables you're working with,

35:22.520 --> 35:24.240
and you have to kind of, you know,

35:24.240 --> 35:26.280
you can't get the perfect of everything.

35:26.280 --> 35:29.200
What's the best, you know, local maximum

35:29.200 --> 35:31.280
of all of these components that come together

35:31.280 --> 35:32.400
to provide an experience?

35:32.400 --> 35:34.240
Local maximums, it's always trade-offs.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.720
What about buttons?

35:35.720 --> 35:37.840
Buttons, oh, there was also the buttons too, right?

35:37.840 --> 35:39.520
Oh, by the way, a lot of these battles

35:39.520 --> 35:41.880
fought inside your mind, or is it with other people?

35:41.880 --> 35:44.840
Is it with Steve, is it lower, like what?

35:44.840 --> 35:46.080
This was all independent.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.520
This was me before being able to present to Steve,

35:48.520 --> 35:50.960
because I had to feel really confident

35:50.960 --> 35:53.920
that if I was gonna put this in front of him,

35:53.920 --> 35:55.240
that it could be made, right?

35:55.240 --> 35:56.960
So I had to convince myself

35:56.960 --> 35:58.560
and go work through all the details,

35:58.560 --> 36:01.320
through like the very, very rough mechanical design,

36:01.320 --> 36:03.760
electrical design, software things,

36:03.760 --> 36:05.240
because I didn't wanna present something

36:05.240 --> 36:06.960
that was gonna be fictional, right?

36:06.960 --> 36:10.160
My credibility would be like trashed, right?

36:10.200 --> 36:12.040
So you mentioned convince yourself,

36:13.160 --> 36:15.680
you're painting this beautiful picture

36:15.680 --> 36:19.680
of a driven engineer, designer, futurist.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.880
How much doubt were you plagued by through that?

36:24.880 --> 36:26.360
Like this is even doable,

36:26.360 --> 36:29.920
because it's not obvious that this is even doable.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.080
Like to do this at scale, to do this kind of thing,

36:33.080 --> 36:36.080
to make it sexy, to shovel the screen,

36:36.760 --> 36:39.760
the batteries, the storage, to make the interface,

36:39.760 --> 36:42.320
the hardware and the software interface work, all of that.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.240
I mean, I don't know, I would be overwhelmed

36:44.240 --> 36:47.240
by the doubt of that, because so many things have to work,

36:47.240 --> 36:48.600
plus the supply chain.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.400
Like at that point, I wasn't getting into

36:50.400 --> 36:52.120
any of those details or anything.

36:52.120 --> 36:55.760
There's the basic stuff that you have to put together.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.280
And then you have to,

36:57.280 --> 36:58.880
through my learnings at General Magic

36:58.880 --> 37:00.160
and my learnings at Phillips,

37:00.160 --> 37:03.560
and delivering multiple large-scale,

37:03.560 --> 37:07.920
delivering multiple large-scale programs in manufacturing,

37:07.920 --> 37:09.160
you kind of get a rule of thumb

37:09.160 --> 37:11.320
and you know what to focus on at the beginning

37:11.320 --> 37:13.480
and what not to worry about over time.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.840
Like when I was early in my career,

37:14.840 --> 37:16.920
I worried about everything on the engineering details,

37:16.920 --> 37:19.760
so much so that I would be a nervous wreck.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.680
Sooner or later, you learn how to filter out

37:21.680 --> 37:23.640
and figure out what to prioritize.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.320
And so 10 years later,

37:25.320 --> 37:28.500
I was able to do a much better job of filtering out

37:28.500 --> 37:31.720
the things of like, we'll get to that in weeks to come.

37:31.720 --> 37:36.080
But right now, we got to solve the very important things,

37:36.080 --> 37:39.280
which is, could this actually be something real

37:39.280 --> 37:42.720
and that you could deliver enough battery life, right?

37:42.720 --> 37:46.900
Enough of an interface of the right cost, right?

37:46.900 --> 37:49.080
And the right price point.

37:49.080 --> 37:51.640
So you were sitting on a track record

37:51.640 --> 37:54.500
of successes and failures in your own mind,

37:54.500 --> 37:59.360
where you had sort of already a confidence, a calmness,

38:00.120 --> 38:03.600
but still, was there a doubt that you can get this done?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.240
Always, always.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.520
How hard is it to achieve a sort of a confidence

38:08.520 --> 38:10.360
to a level where you can present it to Steve

38:10.360 --> 38:12.400
and actually believe that this is doable?

38:13.520 --> 38:15.400
Like what, do you remember when you felt-

38:15.400 --> 38:16.240
Yeah, that moment?

38:16.240 --> 38:17.060
Yeah.

38:17.060 --> 38:19.640
I think it was after I triple checked,

38:19.640 --> 38:22.560
I couldn't bring anyone in, right?

38:22.560 --> 38:24.520
I couldn't let anyone in on this.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.000
So it was just me.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.680
Are they gonna trample on it, that kind of thing?

38:27.680 --> 38:28.520
Why?

38:29.520 --> 38:31.240
When I mean bring anyone in on this,

38:31.240 --> 38:33.800
one, it was a highly confidential program inside of Apple.

38:33.800 --> 38:36.520
There was like four people who knew about it, right?

38:36.520 --> 38:38.240
And so I couldn't bring anyone from Apple

38:38.240 --> 38:40.060
because I was a contractor.

38:40.060 --> 38:42.120
I couldn't bring anyone else from the outside world.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.480
I'm working for Apple and I'm under this crazy NDA, right?

38:45.480 --> 38:46.560
In this contract.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.740
So it was just, so I'm doing this.

38:50.740 --> 38:51.640
Oh, and at the same time,

38:51.640 --> 38:54.160
I'm also buying every competitive product, MP3 player

38:54.160 --> 38:55.920
and tearing them all apart, right?

38:55.920 --> 38:58.160
Tore them all apart and looking at them

38:58.800 --> 39:00.120
and trying to learn from those as well.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.360
So it was all of this stuff in six weeks.

39:02.360 --> 39:05.400
So I didn't sleep, right?

39:05.400 --> 39:06.440
Yeah, yeah.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.720
But I was like, because I was trying to make this,

39:09.720 --> 39:12.760
I was envisioning this since the Nino, right?

39:12.760 --> 39:15.280
And I was like, oh my God, right?

39:15.280 --> 39:17.200
But there was another doubt that I had

39:17.200 --> 39:19.560
and it wasn't just, could you make the product?

39:19.560 --> 39:24.560
But could Apple actually have the balls to make it?

39:25.200 --> 39:27.340
Because Apple was not the same company.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.500
That you know it today, in 2001.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.800
Really, it was cautious, conservative, careful?

39:34.800 --> 39:36.320
It was barely break even.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.160
It was worth four or five billion dollar company.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.080
Oh, so the guts required there

39:41.080 --> 39:43.040
is not necessarily in the innovation.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.240
It's like, this is gonna cost a lot of money

39:45.240 --> 39:47.120
and we're gonna potentially lose all of it

39:47.120 --> 39:49.640
because it'll be a flop.

39:49.640 --> 39:53.000
Well, there's not just that, but there was only the Mac.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.720
And the Mac wasn't doing very well.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.600
There was less, it was about a 1%

39:57.600 --> 40:01.120
only in the US market share for the Mac, right?

40:01.120 --> 40:02.760
The company was in debt.

40:02.760 --> 40:07.680
Bill Gates had to give him a loan, right?

40:07.680 --> 40:09.880
Michael Dell at the time was saying,

40:09.880 --> 40:11.560
shut down the company and give the money

40:11.560 --> 40:13.080
back to the shareholders.

40:13.960 --> 40:17.440
So this is not the company that people go,

40:17.440 --> 40:18.960
oh my God, the iPhone came out.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.680
It's a very different level of confidence

40:20.680 --> 40:24.360
and financial situation that the company was in

40:24.360 --> 40:25.600
versus the iPod.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.640
So given that, what was the conversation

40:27.640 --> 40:29.440
when you finally presented to Steve?

40:31.440 --> 40:33.200
What was that conversation like?

40:34.280 --> 40:37.920
The conversation was, well, we went through it,

40:37.920 --> 40:40.840
the presentation and all that stuff happened.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.480
And he was just like, and he never,

40:43.480 --> 40:45.560
he would flip through it real quick,

40:45.560 --> 40:47.240
throw the presentation aside and said,

40:47.240 --> 40:49.760
okay, let's talk about this, right?

40:49.760 --> 40:51.400
And so we went through it all.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.680
And one was a big conversation about Sony.

40:56.800 --> 41:00.400
And Sony was the number one in all audio categories,

41:00.400 --> 41:03.880
home, portable, in the world, okay?

41:05.080 --> 41:07.440
I had been already gone through 10 years of failure

41:07.440 --> 41:08.280
and I was like, wait a second,

41:08.280 --> 41:09.960
how are we gonna compete with Sony?

41:11.360 --> 41:14.280
And I was always worried that Sony was gonna come out

41:14.280 --> 41:16.080
with whatever it was that they were gonna come out with,

41:16.080 --> 41:20.640
their MP3 player, and that was it, game over, right?

41:20.840 --> 41:23.280
And so I was like, Steve,

41:23.280 --> 41:26.200
and this is why it took me four weeks

41:26.200 --> 41:27.920
to finally sign on to join Apple

41:27.920 --> 41:32.040
after he green-lighted the iPod program in that meeting,

41:32.040 --> 41:35.160
was because I had built other things in the past

41:35.160 --> 41:36.800
at Philips, the Nino and Vilo,

41:36.800 --> 41:38.800
but they didn't know how to sell it or market it.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.400
They didn't know how to retail it, right?

41:41.400 --> 41:42.840
So I was like, we could build this.

41:42.840 --> 41:45.120
And I was like, Steve, I'm pretty sure I can build this.

41:45.120 --> 41:49.040
I've done this before, but how are we gonna sell it?

41:49.080 --> 41:51.320
You have all your marketing dollars on the Mac.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.200
And he looked at me and he goes,

41:54.200 --> 41:56.960
you build this with a team, and our team,

41:56.960 --> 41:59.600
and Apple, and businesses, and me, right?

41:59.600 --> 42:03.040
And I dedicate that we will make sure

42:03.040 --> 42:05.600
that at least two quarters of all marketing dollars

42:05.600 --> 42:08.960
will only go to this product and nothing else.

42:08.960 --> 42:09.800
Wow.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.280
Mac was the lifeblood of all revenue of the company.

42:14.280 --> 42:17.080
So Steve saw something special here.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.440
Exactly.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.880
And he said, I'm going to commit all the marketing dollars

42:20.880 --> 42:22.560
if you can deliver the experience

42:22.560 --> 42:24.400
that we're all talking about.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.160
If we can do that, and that was Jeff Robin as well,

42:26.160 --> 42:29.600
because iPod would have never happened without iTunes.

42:29.600 --> 42:31.280
People don't understand, that was a bundle.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.720
You couldn't do one without the other and vice versa.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.760
So Jeff and I, if Jeff and you can present

42:36.760 --> 42:40.840
and bring that experience to life,

42:40.840 --> 42:42.640
I will put all the marketing dollars behind it.

42:42.640 --> 42:47.120
When did the marriage of iPod and iTunes sort of,

42:48.360 --> 42:53.240
what was that birth of ideas that made up iTunes?

42:53.240 --> 42:56.240
iTunes existed before the iPod, okay?

42:56.240 --> 42:58.560
And so Jeff Robin had his company,

42:58.560 --> 43:00.840
oh man, I can't remember the name of it, but it was bought.

43:00.840 --> 43:04.520
He was making a MP3 player app for the Mac.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.200
Steve saw it because there was MP3 player apps

43:08.200 --> 43:10.600
like Winamp and other things that were on the PC,

43:10.640 --> 43:11.960
it was a real player.

43:11.960 --> 43:15.320
And Steve saw that going on and saw that Jeff

43:15.320 --> 43:17.880
and his small team had this,

43:17.880 --> 43:19.800
I can't remember, sound something.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.040
Anyways, he bought that and that became the basis of iTunes

43:23.040 --> 43:24.920
and then Jeff ran all of iTunes.

43:24.920 --> 43:28.000
And so what happened specifically there was

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
they were starting to hook up

43:29.000 --> 43:31.400
to all these third party MP3 players,

43:31.400 --> 43:34.640
because there's a lot of Korean, the MP man,

43:34.640 --> 43:36.840
like Walkman, but MP man, all these,

43:36.840 --> 43:38.360
and they were trying to hook them up.

43:38.400 --> 43:41.240
And they were like, these are horrible experiences.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.440
And through that, and they said,

43:43.440 --> 43:46.600
iTunes was something that was gonna help grow the Mac base

43:46.600 --> 43:49.480
because we were trying to get more people on the Mac.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.600
So this program would be a great new thing

43:51.600 --> 43:53.120
you could add to the Mac.

43:53.120 --> 43:54.680
And there was also internet connectivity

43:54.680 --> 43:56.040
at the time for the iMac.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.760
And so they did that.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.200
And then they're trying to do these hookups.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.320
They weren't going well.

44:01.320 --> 44:04.600
And that's when they said, we need to build our own.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.200
Or Steve said, we need to build our own

44:06.200 --> 44:08.080
since these are such horrible experiences.

44:08.720 --> 44:11.360
And so people don't wanna just burn CDs from iTunes.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.760
We need to get that music on the go.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.600
But in an Apple fashion, that's when I was called

44:17.560 --> 44:20.840
to come in to do that, the iPod thing.

44:20.840 --> 44:23.840
After the six weeks, then he already envisioned,

44:23.840 --> 44:25.160
I'm sure he had it envisioned

44:25.160 --> 44:27.560
because they were trying to do this thing.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.240
Okay, now that's it.

44:29.240 --> 44:33.240
iTunes, it wasn't called iPod yet.

44:33.240 --> 44:34.680
What would become the iPod?

44:34.680 --> 44:37.280
That is gonna be the thing that then propels Apple

44:37.280 --> 44:38.120
to do that thing because you're gonna bring

44:38.120 --> 44:40.400
all these music lovers in that are gonna need

44:40.400 --> 44:45.400
their next generation or Sony Walkman version 2.0.

44:46.880 --> 44:51.720
So when you look at, again, apologies to linger on iPod,

44:51.720 --> 44:56.560
but it's one of the great inventions in tech history.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.800
What wisdom do you draw from that whole process

45:00.800 --> 45:03.680
about spotting an idea?

45:03.720 --> 45:07.200
This is something you talk about in your book, Build.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.520
How do you know that an idea is brilliant?

45:11.520 --> 45:12.840
At which stage?

45:12.840 --> 45:14.680
When did you know it was a good idea?

45:16.360 --> 45:21.360
And maybe is there some phase shifts?

45:22.040 --> 45:25.160
First, you complete out, then maybe,

45:25.160 --> 45:27.200
and then maybe it becomes more than a hmm

45:27.200 --> 45:29.960
and becomes a little more confident, that kind of stuff.

45:29.960 --> 45:34.040
And also wisdom about who to talk to

45:35.680 --> 45:37.920
so they don't trample the idea in the early stages,

45:37.920 --> 45:38.760
that kind of stuff.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.280
Any thoughts about this?

45:40.280 --> 45:42.640
We could go on, again, how long do you wanna go?

45:42.640 --> 45:47.320
20, this is a Netflix series, I told you, multi-season.

45:47.320 --> 45:50.480
So a lot of lessons learned over those years

45:50.480 --> 45:55.480
of failure and success, but the first thing it starts with,

45:55.880 --> 45:58.720
there's a whole chapter called Great Ideas Chase You,

45:58.760 --> 46:00.760
and so kind of goes into in Build,

46:00.760 --> 46:03.120
and it goes through kind of chapter and verse

46:03.120 --> 46:07.480
about all of those, how Nest became into being.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.920
But let's talk about it specifically for iPod, right?

46:10.920 --> 46:13.600
So for me, I always had pain,

46:13.600 --> 46:16.760
the pain of carrying these CDs everywhere, right?

46:16.760 --> 46:19.800
And I had the joy of music, right?

46:19.800 --> 46:21.200
If you could say, all of a sudden,

46:21.200 --> 46:24.200
I could get the music I love all the time

46:24.200 --> 46:25.880
in a portable package,

46:25.880 --> 46:28.120
and I can have all the music I love all the time,

46:28.120 --> 46:30.600
I was solving a pain, which was,

46:30.600 --> 46:31.840
for me, it was thousands of CDs,

46:31.840 --> 46:34.960
other people might be 10 or 15 CDs, right?

46:34.960 --> 46:38.880
And then I can have the joy of all this music uninterrupted.

46:38.880 --> 46:43.200
That was taking the pain, making a painkiller for it,

46:43.200 --> 46:45.360
and then at the end was a superpower,

46:45.360 --> 46:47.160
an emotional superpower that said,

46:47.160 --> 46:50.560
oh my, this is something different.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.360
So when you can actually focus on a pain,

46:53.360 --> 46:57.400
not, and get a painkiller for it, not a vitamin,

46:57.400 --> 46:59.320
so the difference between a painkiller and a vitamin

46:59.320 --> 47:00.160
is very clear.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.880
One, you need, I gotta get rid of this pain.

47:02.880 --> 47:05.360
A vitamin, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't,

47:05.360 --> 47:06.840
maybe somebody needs it, maybe not,

47:06.840 --> 47:08.960
it's all marketing story, right?

47:08.960 --> 47:11.600
So you start with the pain, give them a painkiller,

47:11.600 --> 47:13.820
and hopefully, if you can do it in the right way,

47:13.820 --> 47:17.420
you give them a superpower, an emotional superpower.

47:17.420 --> 47:21.580
That is always, and that's the way to know

47:21.580 --> 47:23.720
that you're hitting on something that's really powerful.

47:23.720 --> 47:25.520
The pain and the joy.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.960
Exactly.

47:26.960 --> 47:30.360
Are you always aware of the pain?

47:31.360 --> 47:34.320
So it seems like a lot of great products,

47:34.320 --> 47:36.320
it's like we do a lot of painful things

47:36.320 --> 47:40.000
and we just kind of assume that's the way

47:40.000 --> 47:40.840
it's supposed to be.

47:40.840 --> 47:42.620
Like with much autonomous vehicles,

47:42.620 --> 47:45.560
we'll all assume we're supposed to be driving.

47:45.560 --> 47:46.620
Right.

47:46.620 --> 47:50.480
And it doesn't, you don't think of it as a pain.

47:50.480 --> 47:51.380
Right.

47:51.380 --> 47:53.720
Well, you've habituated it away.

47:53.720 --> 47:54.560
Yeah.

47:54.560 --> 47:55.380
You've habituated it away.

47:55.380 --> 47:58.860
For me, when I go to other places,

47:58.860 --> 48:01.060
living in Bali or living in Paris or whatever,

48:01.060 --> 48:05.100
and I'm not driving, I'm walking or I'm using a scooter

48:05.100 --> 48:06.820
or what have you, different thing.

48:06.820 --> 48:10.220
And you go, oh my God, when you left that environment,

48:10.220 --> 48:12.340
because everyone else is driving all the time,

48:12.340 --> 48:13.580
you're like, that's what you do.

48:13.580 --> 48:15.620
And you find out there's other ways of living

48:15.620 --> 48:16.660
and there's freedom.

48:16.660 --> 48:19.060
When you get rid of that, you're like, oh my God,

48:19.060 --> 48:21.780
I didn't know that this was so much better.

48:21.780 --> 48:24.740
So there's something in the book that's called out,

48:25.020 --> 48:27.500
and I deemed it the virus of doubt.

48:27.500 --> 48:31.020
And what the virus of doubt is, is when there's pain

48:31.020 --> 48:33.220
and it's been habituated away,

48:33.220 --> 48:35.900
you use the right marketing messages

48:35.900 --> 48:39.520
to bring people back to that initial experience they had

48:39.520 --> 48:42.240
or the initial experience that they had of that pain.

48:42.240 --> 48:45.580
Do you remember when the first time you did blah

48:45.580 --> 48:48.980
and it felt like this, right?

48:48.980 --> 48:53.480
And then you reawaken that habituated pain.

48:54.480 --> 48:56.960
And people, and it becomes visceral,

48:56.960 --> 49:01.120
and then they're like, oh, yes, I hate that.

49:01.120 --> 49:04.000
And then you go, now I have the painkiller

49:04.000 --> 49:05.760
and the joy for you.

49:05.760 --> 49:08.000
That's when it all comes together and it goes.

49:10.560 --> 49:14.720
Let me, on the pain and the joy that's brilliantly put,

49:14.720 --> 49:19.720
you mentioned selling and marketing, right?

49:19.720 --> 49:21.180
Marketing dollars.

49:21.180 --> 49:25.260
So I have a love-hate relationship with marketing,

49:26.980 --> 49:30.940
like with a lot of things that require artistic genius.

49:30.940 --> 49:34.100
To me, the best marketing, I suppose,

49:34.100 --> 49:37.460
is the product itself and then word of mouth.

49:37.460 --> 49:40.420
So like create a thing that people love.

49:40.420 --> 49:41.940
Oh, absolutely, that's fundamental.

49:41.940 --> 49:46.580
Yeah, so any other marketing requires genius

49:46.580 --> 49:48.500
to be any extra thing.

49:48.500 --> 49:53.500
Because to me, I don't, yeah, maybe you can,

49:54.620 --> 49:59.620
by way of question, I'm just speaking off the top of my head

49:59.700 --> 50:03.700
as a consumer, what is great marketing?

50:03.700 --> 50:07.140
What does it take to reveal the pain

50:07.140 --> 50:08.300
and the joy of a thing?

50:08.300 --> 50:11.860
Okay, it all starts at the beginning.

50:11.860 --> 50:13.820
And let me give you, I'm gonna give you a couple

50:13.820 --> 50:15.900
of different ways of looking at it, okay?

50:15.900 --> 50:18.500
And again, we're gonna, it might go a little long here.

50:18.500 --> 50:22.260
So just stay tuned in.

50:22.260 --> 50:23.100
So the first thing is-

50:23.100 --> 50:23.940
Start at the beginning.

50:23.940 --> 50:26.060
Let's start at the beginning.

50:26.060 --> 50:29.380
In the early part of my career, like General Magic

50:29.380 --> 50:31.200
and Phillips and what have you,

50:33.620 --> 50:36.420
and especially when I was a teenager,

50:36.420 --> 50:39.920
when I was making my own chips and stuff like that,

50:39.920 --> 50:44.140
I really worried about just putting cool things together.

50:44.140 --> 50:46.580
I'm like that, when I put those two cool things together

50:46.580 --> 50:48.900
as an engineer, you go, that's cool.

50:48.900 --> 50:50.500
And then I would talk to some of the other friends

50:50.500 --> 50:53.140
who might be geeks too, and they go, yeah, that's cool.

50:54.220 --> 50:57.060
Because we knew the bits, so we put them together

50:57.060 --> 50:58.260
and that's a new way of doing it.

50:58.260 --> 51:02.860
And you're like, wow, that's all what.

51:02.860 --> 51:03.960
It's not why.

51:04.860 --> 51:06.380
Why are you doing this?

51:06.380 --> 51:08.640
We know what we're doing, but we don't know why

51:08.640 --> 51:10.340
we're doing it, because we're not articulating it

51:10.340 --> 51:12.180
for ourselves, because it's just something

51:12.180 --> 51:13.580
we're like putting it together and like, yeah,

51:13.580 --> 51:17.100
that's cool, because we think we're solving

51:17.100 --> 51:19.700
some problem we have, but we're not really articulating it.

51:19.700 --> 51:21.820
So what normally happens, and this happens

51:21.820 --> 51:24.940
because we invest in so many companies around the world,

51:24.940 --> 51:26.980
you have these brilliant engineers, designers,

51:26.980 --> 51:31.540
scientists, researchers, they put together these what's.

51:32.620 --> 51:35.780
And then they develop it, develop it, develop it,

51:35.780 --> 51:38.180
and then at the end, they call in marketing

51:38.180 --> 51:40.660
and say, now tell a story about this

51:40.660 --> 51:42.940
and let's get it out to the world, okay?

51:43.940 --> 51:46.380
What happens then is marketing is like,

51:46.380 --> 51:48.300
well, why do people need this?

51:48.300 --> 51:50.340
Tell us why people need it.

51:50.340 --> 51:53.540
And so they create a story around this product,

51:54.420 --> 51:57.740
but the product was born out of what, it's not why's.

51:57.740 --> 52:00.700
And so marketing starts telling a story

52:00.700 --> 52:03.500
and it turns out to be a fictional story usually.

52:03.500 --> 52:06.180
They say, oh, this is going to do these things.

52:06.180 --> 52:07.940
The product comes and is delivered

52:07.940 --> 52:10.100
and it falls flat on its face,

52:10.100 --> 52:12.940
because the marketing doesn't match the product

52:12.980 --> 52:14.540
because they weren't both created

52:14.540 --> 52:17.980
at the beginning together, right?

52:17.980 --> 52:19.780
There are what's when you create a product,

52:19.780 --> 52:21.420
but there's a lot more why's,

52:21.420 --> 52:23.740
and the why's help inform the what's,

52:23.740 --> 52:27.060
and the why's also inform the marketing.

52:27.060 --> 52:31.300
So that's what you mean deeply,

52:31.300 --> 52:32.700
we should start at the beginning.

52:32.700 --> 52:35.660
So the designer should be also the marketer,

52:35.660 --> 52:37.980
the engineer should be the marketer.

52:37.980 --> 52:40.580
Exactly, stop impressing the geek next to you.

52:40.580 --> 52:42.580
What is the superpower you're bringing

52:43.180 --> 52:48.180
or the pain you're killing for the end customer, right?

52:48.180 --> 52:50.100
Now let's contrast that.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.180
Think about a movie.

52:53.180 --> 52:55.020
A movie starts with a treatment.

52:55.020 --> 52:56.980
It has an audience, it says the audience,

52:56.980 --> 52:59.300
here's the characters, here's the storyline, the plot,

52:59.300 --> 53:02.820
here's the arc of the story, right?

53:02.820 --> 53:04.740
It pulls that all out.

53:04.740 --> 53:07.300
Then there's a script that's written.

53:07.300 --> 53:09.660
And that script is then produced

53:09.660 --> 53:11.180
and then you add all the flourishes

53:11.180 --> 53:14.740
somewhat having music and graphics and what have you, right?

53:14.740 --> 53:15.820
And then it comes out

53:15.820 --> 53:17.260
and then there's the marketing of the movie

53:17.260 --> 53:19.660
and that story was created at the beginning.

53:19.660 --> 53:22.780
What you need to do if you're gonna do a great product

53:22.780 --> 53:24.940
is create that treatment for your product.

53:24.940 --> 53:26.980
And I call that the press release.

53:26.980 --> 53:30.500
Do the press release, like the treatment,

53:30.500 --> 53:31.620
who's the audience?

53:31.620 --> 53:33.260
What features do you have?

53:33.260 --> 53:35.060
What pains are you solving for people?

53:35.060 --> 53:37.780
Have the virus of doubt there to remind them

53:37.780 --> 53:40.020
what pains they have and why you're solving them.

53:40.020 --> 53:41.780
The price, all of those things.

53:41.780 --> 53:46.620
And you use that as the bar, the measuring stick

53:46.620 --> 53:48.500
for what you do during development.

53:48.500 --> 53:52.580
Because what happens that along the route, you know this,

53:52.580 --> 53:55.380
oh, we're not gonna be able to get that feature done on time.

53:55.380 --> 53:58.500
Throw that one overboard, we have to hit the date.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.980
Oh, we're not sure this product's right yet.

54:00.980 --> 54:05.300
Add another feature, add another feature creep, right?

54:05.300 --> 54:06.460
If you don't have that story,

54:06.460 --> 54:08.460
you know you're gonna tell at the beginning,

54:08.500 --> 54:11.340
you don't have that bar, right?

54:11.340 --> 54:13.740
And then at the end, you don't know when you're done

54:13.740 --> 54:14.580
if you don't have that source.

54:14.580 --> 54:16.940
So you can actually look at that press release.

54:16.940 --> 54:21.900
You know, you change it over time, that draft.

54:21.900 --> 54:24.860
But then when you're done, you know the what's and the why's.

54:24.860 --> 54:26.900
You have all the things, have the audience and everything.

54:26.900 --> 54:29.500
And then you can give that to marketing and say,

54:29.500 --> 54:32.100
well, and marketing's been along the way, let's be clear.

54:32.100 --> 54:33.940
But then everybody's in sync.

54:33.940 --> 54:37.300
And that's when you can tell a cohesive non-fictional story

54:37.740 --> 54:39.620
and the product delivers on that story

54:39.620 --> 54:42.020
or hopefully over delivers on that story.

54:42.020 --> 54:46.540
So in the drafting from the beginning to the end

54:46.540 --> 54:47.780
of the press release,

54:47.780 --> 54:49.860
what does a successful team look like?

54:49.860 --> 54:51.540
Who's part of the draft?

54:51.540 --> 54:53.580
Is it engineers, designers?

54:53.580 --> 54:57.820
What's the purpose of a marketing department in a company?

54:57.820 --> 55:02.460
Small, let's say small company, but more than two people.

55:02.460 --> 55:06.940
So from where does the why come from?

55:06.940 --> 55:08.820
Should it always come from the designer

55:08.820 --> 55:12.380
or should there be a marketing person that steps in

55:12.380 --> 55:13.700
and asks the question?

55:13.700 --> 55:16.180
So I'll just keep asking random questions.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.100
I know these are great questions.

55:18.100 --> 55:20.100
So, cause you're just like, I'm like,

55:20.100 --> 55:22.220
I can't wait to tell you the answer.

55:22.220 --> 55:23.820
So it's in the book as well,

55:23.820 --> 55:25.820
but you have to separate out

55:25.820 --> 55:27.820
the various functions of marketing.

55:28.900 --> 55:30.900
When, that's what I thought I was like,

55:30.900 --> 55:32.860
marketing's marketing, you know, when I was,

55:32.860 --> 55:34.460
and it's really not.

55:34.460 --> 55:35.660
There's so many disciplines,

55:35.660 --> 55:38.100
just like in engineering, mechanical, electrical,

55:38.100 --> 55:40.220
software, and even software, it's, you know,

55:40.220 --> 55:43.740
are your cloud services, firmware, applications.

55:43.740 --> 55:47.140
Marketing has that much diversity as well, okay?

55:47.140 --> 55:48.940
And you have to honor that.

55:48.940 --> 55:53.420
And so there is marketing communications like PR,

55:53.420 --> 55:54.740
press, press.

55:54.740 --> 55:57.980
There is social marketing.

55:57.980 --> 56:01.020
There is a marketing creative, right?

56:01.020 --> 56:02.840
There's marketing activation.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.560
But there's another thing that also comes out

56:06.560 --> 56:10.480
and people confuse it with marketing,

56:10.480 --> 56:14.200
which is called product marketing or product management.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.560
And product management or product marketing

56:16.560 --> 56:18.160
is the voice of the customer.

56:19.600 --> 56:22.080
They're the person who sits there

56:22.080 --> 56:24.520
and listens to what's going on in the competition,

56:24.520 --> 56:27.560
in the marketplace, understanding the needs

56:27.560 --> 56:29.200
and those pains of the customer.

56:29.200 --> 56:32.400
And they're representing them in every single meeting.

56:32.400 --> 56:35.680
So things don't get off track, right?

56:35.680 --> 56:39.080
So that, and they're creating the messages,

56:39.080 --> 56:40.120
not the marketing.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.440
What happens is there's messages

56:41.440 --> 56:42.640
that product marketing creates.

56:42.640 --> 56:44.040
Like those are the deep messages,

56:44.040 --> 56:48.840
like we need to save 20% of energy, let's say, right?

56:48.840 --> 56:50.960
And then marketing turns that into something

56:50.960 --> 56:53.040
that's with creative and everything

56:53.040 --> 56:54.300
and brings that message across.

56:54.300 --> 56:55.200
Maybe it doesn't say that,

56:55.200 --> 56:58.200
but it comes maybe visually or some other way.

56:58.200 --> 57:00.640
So product management does that

57:00.640 --> 57:05.520
and holds that press release along the route

57:05.520 --> 57:07.680
and making sure that we're tracking.

57:07.680 --> 57:09.440
And then also marketing is tracking

57:09.440 --> 57:10.280
with that press release

57:10.280 --> 57:12.840
to make sure they're not telling a fictional story, right?

57:12.840 --> 57:15.920
Cause they can also add extra adjectives or something.

57:15.920 --> 57:17.440
And then the product can't deliver that.

57:17.440 --> 57:18.840
It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

57:18.840 --> 57:19.680
Keeps everybody-

57:19.680 --> 57:22.120
It has to be grounded to the press release, to the raws.

57:22.120 --> 57:24.120
Right, to the customer needs, right?

57:24.120 --> 57:25.980
Cause they're always representing the customer.

57:25.980 --> 57:28.740
So you have to have a product manager.

57:28.740 --> 57:31.060
Typically that's the founder, right?

57:31.060 --> 57:32.260
In the beginning.

57:32.260 --> 57:36.480
And then over time you hire a product management team

57:36.480 --> 57:40.260
to then really watch over this the whole way.

57:40.260 --> 57:42.720
And they are talking to customer support.

57:42.720 --> 57:43.700
They're talking to engineering.

57:43.700 --> 57:45.180
They're talking to design.

57:45.180 --> 57:47.660
They're talking to sales and marketing.

57:47.660 --> 57:50.580
And they are always in the mix.

57:50.580 --> 57:52.540
And it's the hardest thing to hire for.

57:53.060 --> 57:55.620
Yeah, so they have this very important job

57:55.620 --> 57:58.940
of developing and maintaining the why.

57:58.940 --> 57:59.820
Exactly.

57:59.820 --> 58:01.660
Why is it the hardest to hire for?

58:01.660 --> 58:03.540
Because you have to understand.

58:03.540 --> 58:05.120
First, nobody reports to you.

58:07.180 --> 58:10.540
So you're alone and you have to build great ties

58:10.540 --> 58:13.740
with all of these different functions.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.900
You have to understand what they do,

58:15.900 --> 58:17.660
be empathetic with what they do.

58:17.660 --> 58:21.960
And you have to project the customer's empathy

58:22.480 --> 58:25.320
for the customer to them and tell them why

58:25.320 --> 58:28.720
and why this customer needs this, why this doesn't work.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.280
And so that they learn more.

58:30.280 --> 58:31.120
They're not just doing,

58:31.120 --> 58:33.840
but they learn about the customer's point of view

58:33.840 --> 58:36.360
and sit in there and stand in their shoes

58:36.360 --> 58:38.160
to be able to then make better decisions

58:38.160 --> 58:41.120
on the engineering details or the operational details,

58:41.120 --> 58:42.600
customer support details.

58:42.600 --> 58:47.280
So they understand that if they're not the customer

58:47.280 --> 58:48.440
that it's intended for,

58:48.440 --> 58:51.580
they start to live through their eyes

58:51.580 --> 58:53.820
and see through their eyes of that customer

58:53.820 --> 58:55.140
so they make better decisions.

58:55.140 --> 58:59.500
And there's probably fascinating and beautiful tensions

58:59.500 --> 59:03.540
between that and sort of the engineers.

59:03.540 --> 59:04.580
Oh, that's cool.

59:04.580 --> 59:08.220
Sort of the developing the what.

59:08.220 --> 59:09.060
Exactly.

59:09.060 --> 59:11.860
And which makes it an extra hard job, I'm sure.

59:11.860 --> 59:12.700
Exactly.

59:12.700 --> 59:15.780
Can I ask a sort of a little bit of a personal question?

59:15.780 --> 59:19.020
One subfield of marketing, you mentioned comms and PR.

59:22.420 --> 59:23.460
How do I ask that?

59:23.460 --> 59:26.140
I can hear your struggle in your thigh.

59:27.900 --> 59:32.900
Why or do the comms and PR folks sometimes

59:36.420 --> 59:41.420
kill the heart and soul of the magic that makes a company?

59:42.460 --> 59:45.100
Or is that wrong to say?

59:45.100 --> 59:46.720
Give me an example.

59:46.720 --> 59:48.980
I will say the spirit of the example,

59:48.980 --> 59:53.980
which is it feels like often the jobs of communications

59:55.860 --> 59:57.660
is to provide caution.

59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.300
It almost works together with legal to say.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.140
A shield.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:06.540
Yeah, we probably should not say this.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.180
Let's be careful, let's be careful.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:14.180
Now that makes sense, except in this modern world,

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.180
authenticity is extremely valuable.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:25.020
And revealing the beauty that is in the engineering,

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.980
the beauty of the ideas, the chaos of the ideas,

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.420
I think requires throwing caution to the wind

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.740
to some degree.

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.580
I agree.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:40.580
And I just find that, boy, I mean, it's really,

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.020
so to push back on myself,

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.420
I think it's an extremely difficult job

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.500
because people will hold you responsible

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:51.500
if you're doing communications when you take risks,

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.820
and especially when they fail.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:57.540
So it's a difficult job,

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.580
so I understand why people become cautious,

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:03.540
but to me, communications is about taking big risks

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:06.100
and throwing caution to the wind at its best

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:11.100
because your job is to communicate in the long term,

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.020
communicate the genius, the joy,

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.740
the genius of the product.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:23.180
And that sometimes is a tension with caution.

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.740
Sorry, so because I've gotten the chance to meet

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.620
a lot of very interesting people

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.300
and interesting engineering teams and so on,

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.340
I look at what they're doing

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.780
and I look at what's being communicated.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:37.700
And it's just, there's a mismatch

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.140
because the communication is a lot more boring.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.140
It's like there's something very,

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.940
like just straight up boring

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.820
about the way they're communicating because of caution.

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:54.740
Okay, you have just teed me up for another diatribe, okay?

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.140
I'm gonna get on my podium here.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:01:58.980
Yes, please.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.140
It all comes out of the leader.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.180
If the leader doesn't know how to storytell

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.500
or the leader doesn't know how to do bold storytelling,

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:14.100
then you get even more conservatism

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.100
from the PR and communications folks

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.260
because they're always, so if you have a,

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:23.620
not a bold leader, they're always going to be a filter, right?

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.620
They're always gonna try to smooth things out

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.380
and take off the rough edges and try,

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.420
so they're gonna be even more,

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.260
if you have a conservative messaging leader,

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.860
you're gonna have an even more conservative

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.260
communications department.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.100
Why?

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.820
Because they wanna keep their jobs, okay?

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.100
It's really simple.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.020
They gotta keep their jobs.

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:44.420
If they say one wrong thing, it could be the end of it.

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.740
So if you have very conservative leader,

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:48.900
they're going to be even more conservative.

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:50.980
If you have a bold leader, they will be,

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:54.220
oh, they'll always take a little more conservative bet,

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:56.420
but you're still gonna have bold communications.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.660
Yeah, that's brilliant.

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:00.180
Okay, so it starts with the leader.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:05.180
Now, that said, when you think about the messages

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.260
and the joy and revealing things, right?

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:18.540
Many of these leaders don't tell great stories.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.340
So what we do at FutureShape, our investment firm,

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.340
is we take those scientists,

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:25.780
and the great minds and everything,

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:28.180
and what do we surround them with?

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.500
Marketing and communication people and storytellers

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:36.020
to give them the confidence to tell a much broader story

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.060
about the impacts of what they're creating

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:42.220
and how big the global change can be

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.300
with those technologies, because usually they don't,

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.620
those leaders who created those technologies,

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.460
they don't really know how to communicate really well,

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.740
and they don't feel very comfortable in how they speak.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.340
Yeah, so it's interesting,

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:57.820
because stories, and I'm a huge fan of stories.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.660
Have you ever read the book Story by Robert McKee?

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.660
You should read this, and this is what I read when I was 26.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.700
Story by Robert McKee,

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:12.500
and it's a book all about the ways to do script writing,

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.700
the prototypical types of scripts, drama, comedy,

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.580
and how it's been shown over millennia,

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.740
how these stories are done.

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:26.060
It's a fascinating thing, and it gives you an insight to,

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:30.020
and it's written for obviously Hollywood and movies

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.220
and things like that, but it's incredibly useful

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.700
for what we do as designers and engineers

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.980
and technology, piano leaders.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:41.260
There's some aspect in this modern day where,

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.660
this podcast and so on,

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.300
what I love is the humans behind the story too.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.660
So some part of the story is the human beings.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:54.420
So humor, drama,

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.420
heartbreak, hope.

01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.260
Emotions.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.580
Emotions.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.100
That's not just about painting a beautiful story

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.580
that's flawless.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.780
It's-

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:06.660
Vulnerability.

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:11.660
Yep, it's being a dreamer, over-promising,

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:16.260
and then failing, so changing your mind,

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.580
realizing just the whole of it,

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.540
and then also being, depending of course

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:26.020
where your personality is, embracing the full richness

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.620
and the complexity of the personality of the leader

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.300
or the different people involved.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:31.980
I mean, that's all part of it.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.740
You can't just present this beautiful,

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.860
always pleasant-ville view of a product.

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:42.860
There has to be this humanity that's part of it,

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.940
the full rollercoaster of the humanity,

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.460
which I think has been very difficult

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.620
for companies to embrace.

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.500
I'm not sure why.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.780
Maybe it's just an old-school way of doing things

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.820
that people think that we present the facade,

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.900
and we generate the story and we tell the story

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.780
as opposed to sort of-

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.540
Well, we learn, especially in the technical world,

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.380
we present the story as it's faster, it's smaller,

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.660
it's longer battery life, it's bits and numbers

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.540
and metrics.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.380
That resonates, sure, with other geeks.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.700
What resonates with the planet?

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.540
It's all emotions, right?

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.220
And if you can bring a great emotional story,

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.780
but with a great rational story at the same time,

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:36.260
why you should do this, and it's like,

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:39.540
oh my God, you bring that superpower, that joy,

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.340
then it all hangs.

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.020
And there's personal drama too, like-

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.060
The human.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.100
Right?

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.860
Here's the pain I had, remember that thing.

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:53.860
And just, you're obviously this extremely well-known

01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:02.500
human being that's behind a lot of these great inventions

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.900
of the technology world, but you're also just a human being.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:09.420
You have clearly a distinct personality

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.860
that comes through, like your eyes light up,

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.900
just the way you communicate is you.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.980
Thank you.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.700
Some people are more stoic, some people are,

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:23.020
like Elon is all over the place, the chaos.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:27.740
Steve Jobs, there's a very, I mean, it's hard to put

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.460
into words, I can be poetic and so on,

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:32.860
but there's a very distinct, comes on stage,

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.220
that personality is right there.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:37.220
That's not just a product, that's something else too.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.060
Correct.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.180
And you have to reveal that a little bit,

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.140
and allow people to reveal that a little bit,

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.900
and just let them be themselves.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:50.900
Well, look, why do I think your podcast is so amazing?

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.100
Because you are yourself.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.620
You talk about yourself, you bring your emotions into it,

01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:00.540
and you don't modulate it, you're you, right?

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:04.020
It comes through, it's true, it feels right.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.580
You are you, you dress the way you wanna dress,

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.660
you say, this is me, and this is all of me,

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.580
and you become vulnerable, right?

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.060
It's much easier to do a podcast like that,

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:17.340
than run a very large company, where a lot of people

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.820
would feel the pain if you make,

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:23.660
if you say something stupid, so it's much more easy

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.420
to be afraid, and be careful, so,

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.820
but nevertheless, the same applies.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:35.300
Authenticity and risk taking is the only way,

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:39.580
unfortunately, to be successful in the long term.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.540
Let me, just because we're jumping all over the place,

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:46.380
I just link on the iPod, one of the great designs,

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.820
broadly speaking, in the word design, of all time,

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:53.700
what does it take to design a great product?

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.660
If you look, we could jump around, we could look at Nest,

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.620
we could look at iPod, we could look at iPhone,

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.620
and many of the great things you design,

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:07.620
but just looking at that one transformational thing,

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:13.260
what can you say about what it takes to do a great design,

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.260
or maybe what makes a great design?

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.940
Well, we talked about, you know, a painkiller,

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:26.340
and we talked about the, we talked about that, you know,

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:30.180
joy that comes from it, but then there's the,

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:33.220
behind the scenes, there's the team,

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.340
there's everyone who brings it to life,

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.900
brings that story to life.

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:41.820
If you have a great story, and you know the why,

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:44.220
then you can communicate it to those people

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:46.020
who are working on it,

01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:49.060
and then they bring their own thing into it, right?

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.180
It becomes emotional for them too.

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.380
It's not just a job, it's a mission.

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:58.420
And so, many of the details that are born

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:01.980
out of these early prototypes,

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.820
these things that you still haven't given full form to,

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:08.860
there may be 80% done, or maybe even 60% done,

01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.700
but you can see enough in there.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.740
Then, you take those great ideas,

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.980
and you give the whys to the team,

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.540
and so that they feel it, they can understand it,

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.620
then they bring their best and their ideas to the table,

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.620
and then you can select from those,

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:27.700
and you can then start to, you know,

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.820
it could be just a pixel change,

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:32.380
it could be a slight change on how you do the audio

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:35.820
for the feedback, or maybe a curve on the mechanics,

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.180
or something like that, of how it feels,

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.860
because everybody brings themselves trying to,

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:41.700
you know, feel this thing.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.700
They're not just doing something

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.460
that someone told them to do.

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.180
If you can instill that mission, and that why into that team,

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:52.500
it doesn't have to be big, you get, I feel, a 10X.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.620
Everyone comes together in a special way,

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.740
and the magic is created.

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.660
You put the love into it,

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.660
the customer feels the love on the other side.

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:07.660
So the making the team,

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:11.740
like taking them in onto the vision, onto the why,

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.180
now they feel the, all the little details we think of,

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:21.180
the original iPod, and all the many generations after,

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:25.900
all those little details are in them,

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:29.660
is the emotion of the engineers and the designers, that.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.620
It's their baby.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:34.180
Working, nights, struggling, this isn't right.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.100
Like you said, changing little pixels here and there,

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:42.100
changing the shape of things, changing the feel of things,

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:47.100
like the materials, the, I don't know,

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.540
just everything on the software, the packaging.

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.540
The words on the packaging.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:52.380
Just everything.

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.900
The words on the website.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.260
And always jumping from the very specific detail problem

01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:00.220
to the big picture, how the thing feels, the overall.

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.620
Always jumping back and forth.

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.940
What does it look like to the customer?

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:07.700
How are we gonna implement it in the most efficient way?

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.340
Because a lot of the stuff you don't know

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:12.500
is some of that stuff is hacked in.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.620
Maybe hacked in at the end.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.060
It may not be the most beautiful architecture

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:17.980
that a geek would look at and go,

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:19.780
oh my God, that's so beautiful.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.420
Because we can look at and visualize

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.500
this incredible software stack or hardware stack.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.700
Some of it could just be hacked in.

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.300
You make it better over time.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:30.620
But it was that brilliant thing and we gotta get that in

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.260
because that's the way you do it now

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.220
and we'll make it more efficient later.

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:38.620
Maybe this is a good moment to draw a distinction

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.260
between design and engineering

01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.540
and does such a distinction even exist?

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.460
Are these distinct disciplines or no?

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.900
I don't think they're distinct.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:50.020
I think they're different types of design.

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:54.980
I think there's always this idea of this,

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:58.420
oh, on the mount designer and it all comes down

01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.740
and it all flows down like some magic.

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.380
There are electrical designers, there's AI designers,

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.780
there is data scientist designers.

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.620
Everybody has design and there's a chapter in the book

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.460
all about that actually.

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.060
That it's not just you go to the mount

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.540
and it comes down and you're enlightened.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.740
It's each person brings their form of design

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.060
and their craft.

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.140
Because if they're really good,

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:25.460
they're artists in their own right.

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.740
They're not just engineers.

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.700
They're not just designing, they're artists.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.580
They're empathetic.

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:30.940
They really wanna bring their best.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:32.500
A lot of the best engineers I have

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.780
are not the technical or that I've worked with

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:38.220
are not the technical gotta get it exactly right.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:39.060
They're the artists.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.140
They came from music or they came from other things

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.420
and they see that.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:47.020
When you work with very rigid engineers,

01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:49.460
this is the way, the only way, la, la, la.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.380
Those are not the engineers I wanna work with.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:54.740
They're all like a bit artists at heart.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.580
Right.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:59.060
They understand the practicalness.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.260
They don't have to have the rigidity of

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:03.660
this is the way it's done.

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:04.940
Like, mm-mm.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.180
Where if you're building something new,

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:10.420
all new and revolutionary, none of us are experts at it.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.820
And if you come with that expert mindset,

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:15.420
just tell me and I can give you a story.

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:18.940
I should probably give you that story about that.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.220
If you come with the expert and I'm the expert,

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.780
when you're doing something no one's ever done before,

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.500
I don't want you on the team

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.660
because we all are learning about something

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.820
that has never been in existence before.

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.500
And we have to bring that level of vulnerability

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:37.700
and openness to new ideas and new ways of doing things

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.540
throughout the team.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.940
So you want people that are able to have like

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.220
beginner's mind or whatever.

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.060
Beginner's mind.

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.420
Don't come in as an expert.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.340
What's the story?

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.180
Okay, there's a story.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.020
You know a lot?

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:49.860
Okay, all right.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.680
No, I can tell it for sure.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.920
So you asked what were these risks on the early iPod

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.720
and there was a few big risks.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.920
Like one, and this doesn't go in the story,

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:03.960
but like putting rotating media in your pocket

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.160
and it could drop at any time.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.040
What happens there and you can damage

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.040
because the heads and the hard drive media are so close.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.280
It smacks, it's dead, right?

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.680
So that was one big one, like holy shit, right?

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:17.520
So that was something we,

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.360
and we had to design special tests and everything

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.040
and special software on that.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.560
But then there was another one which was at the early days,

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.760
the way the first generations of iPods,

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:31.760
I had to hack the IDE interface to the hard drives.

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.320
So I was like, okay, what we're gonna use

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.960
is we're gonna use this chip for hard drive,

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.000
to make a hard drive, you had to have a chip

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.840
that did firewire to a hard drive, okay?

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.760
And then that would become a portable hard drive.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.680
Well, then we had the MP3 player

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.360
and the user interface and everything.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.480
So there was times when it was just this hard drive

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.440
and there was times when it was a MP3 player.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.640
And I had to hot switch between

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.920
what the hard drive thinks it was talking to, right?

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.560
So designed this thing, tore it apart, done all this stuff.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.120
And I was like, you know, maybe I'm gonna screw up IDE

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:13.040
and there's something, there's some holes I'm gonna see.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:15.440
So I go, who's the expert at Apple

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.440
who understands IDE and everything?

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.200
So this person comes over,

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.560
the mass storage specialist comes over

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.000
and I put on the whiteboard and say,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:25.920
here's how we're gonna do this thing

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.200
and here's the commands and this is how it hot switches

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.720
and everything, he's like, that's never gonna work.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720
Yeah.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.560
I was like, what?

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.920
It goes, never gonna work.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.160
I said, well, let me go over here

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.280
and show you this right here.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.800
I have it prototyped and it's been working for days.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.080
I just wanna see if you're gonna find any holes

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.000
in the thing. Right.

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.720
And he just stormed out of the room and never even.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.840
Yeah. Right.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:47.880
That's hilarious.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.800
I've had a lot of experience like this with experts.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.280
Like for example, this ridiculous room.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.240
I had a person and there's many people like this

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:03.240
that I showed them, here's the situation, you know.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.000
For acoustics or something? For acoustics, yeah.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.040
They're like, no, no, no, no, this is horrible.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:11.760
This is not gonna work.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:15.880
The reflection, the curtains are not gonna stop.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.480
There's a bunch of terminology they're telling me.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.040
It's a similar kind of situation as the idea,

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.440
which I was like, no, listen,

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.640
I just need to see is there major issues

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.240
and they're like a low hanging fruit that are fixable

01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.160
and major holes I should be aware of.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.720
Not like, let's.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.600
$100,000 to upgrade.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.360
To upgrade for what exact purpose?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.400
What, not why?

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:40.440
Yeah, exactly.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.800
Exactly, the why.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.200
The focusing on the story, on the content, on the,

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.800
the why, the why, the why.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.960
And that actually I've experienced that unfortunately

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.560
in the artistic realms too,

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:56.360
which is like photography and videography, cinematography.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.680
It's interesting, I talk to photographers

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.040
that are quote unquote experts.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:05.040
And it's always about, so much of the focus is on

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.040
the equipment, the equipment behind

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.560
the sensors and the lighting.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:15.320
And it's like, all right, all right.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.240
But what about, what about the feeling

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:26.160
of the story you create visually?

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.920
The difference between a movie that's really well told

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.040
and it doesn't have all the effects and everything

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.200
versus maybe some of the superhero movies

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.200
we see all the time, which is good luck if there's a story,

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.360
but man, there's a lot of action and CGI.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.560
Well, that's right.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:47.560
And there's also value to those CGI, superhero.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.680
Can tell a better story,

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:51.880
but you have to have a good story to begin with.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.080
Sure, exactly.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.600
But if you're focused on the story,

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.400
I guess you need to start with a story.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.840
You need to start the story.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.600
And if you bring in experts,

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.600
they can often be detrimental, I guess, to the why.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.040
They're too good at doing the what.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.520
Well, you can bring in experts for why.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.800
There's lots of experts for why.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.440
Too many times we get experts for what.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.280
Yes.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.160
And then they only focus on the what.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.640
And so they come with the specs and feeds

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:24.080
and the numbers and all the other stuff.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.920
But what you're really asking for is I need somebody

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.040
about the why and understanding what we're trying

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:32.520
to get done here and fitting the what's into that why, right?

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.560
That's why I do think that one of the qualities

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:40.920
that I really enjoy for people to work with is humility

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.160
for a particular problem when you approach it.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.560
Basically, I don't know how to solve this,

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.080
but we're going to figure it out as opposed to,

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.640
oh, I've solved this thing many, many times before.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.520
I know exactly what to do.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.800
Humility before the chaos.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:59.280
So having an open mind that this is going to require

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.800
a totally new way of doing things

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.640
is a really nice quality to see.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.360
You're one of the fascinating humans in the history

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.640
of Silicon Valley.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.440
Steve is another one of those.

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.880
So those two humans came together for a time

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.240
to work together.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.880
What was it like working with Steve Jobs?

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:22.520
What aspect of his behavior and personality,

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.480
let's say, brought out the best in you?

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.360
Pushing you.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.620
Really pushing you.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.620
Relentless on the details.

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.900
Challenging you for the right reasons.

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.020
It wasn't bullying.

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:36.420
It wasn't demeaning.

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.140
He would critique the work, not judge the person,

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:41.380
at least not in front of them,

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.460
or inside of a, you know, in front of a group

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.860
or anything like that.

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.900
I know it was really that attention to detail.

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:50.340
And he, when he would make a decision, you know,

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:52.740
there are, when you make the first version of anything,

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:53.940
something revolutionary,

01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:56.540
there are a lot of opinion-based decisions.

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.700
And there's only one or two people,

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.620
three people who hold those opinion-based decisions

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.060
and what they should be.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:06.580
And when you have those opinions

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:09.900
and you're trying to work with the team

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:13.740
to implement those decisions,

01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:16.900
you have to really tell the why of those decisions.

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:19.900
Just don't go do it, but why it's there.

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:23.800
So you can feel part of that decision.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.100
You can understand what were the trade-offs

01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:31.140
of the different other answers to that opinion, right?

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:35.260
And say, this is the reason why we picked the route we picked

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:36.700
because it's this for the customer

01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.820
or this for the whole overall story, what have you,

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.980
so that you felt really good

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.700
because a lot of times most people

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:44.340
want a data-driven decision.

01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:48.160
But with V1s, you don't get data, right?

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.060
Maybe in a B2B you could a little bit

01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:51.340
because you can talk to customers,

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.900
but you can't do that with a consumer product.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:57.100
V1 version one, B2B, business to business

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.300
versus what's the alternative?

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:01.180
Business to consumer, V1.

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:03.820
Okay, we're just defining some terms.

01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:06.380
Yes, sure, absolutely.

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:09.740
And when you say data-driven decisions versus what?

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.220
Opinion-based decisions.

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:14.500
So like gut, you have to use, you don't have any...

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.860
You can't fall back on any data or any previous history

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:23.020
to kind of inform you of what's going on, right?

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:27.740
And so if you look at most companies who are paralyzed

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.780
and cannot make new innovations and new products,

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:33.540
it's because they're trying to turn,

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.080
and this is what I saw at Phillips,

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:37.380
they're trying to turn opinion-based decisions

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.760
into data-driven decisions so they don't lose their jobs.

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:43.940
So if you look at management consulting,

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.220
management consulting is all about

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.480
taking those opinion-based decisions,

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.000
giving them to someone else to turn into data

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.880
that comes back to them and says,

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.680
they can blame the management consultants

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.680
when something goes wrong, as opposed to it wasn't me, right?

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.160
When you need to have to tell that story,

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:06.040
you have to understand that, especially with V1,

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:09.680
you need to be able to articulate

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.240
those opinion-based decisions, and you need to own them.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.480
And if you fail with some of them, you didn't get it right,

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:21.800
you then own them and fix them and move on, right?

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.000
Version one of the iPod wasn't perfect.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.960
Version one of the iPhone wasn't perfect.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.380
We got a lot of opinion-based decisions wrong.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.000
But as you go through it, because you got more data,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.960
because V2, you had data on those original opinions,

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.480
and then you were able to then modulate off of that, right?

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.800
And you'll still have new opinions

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.600
because those are differentiators

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.120
that we call differentiators, the things that, you know,

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:48.240
move the product forward in its evolution.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.840
But at the revolution stage,

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.560
opinions, opinions, opinions, no data.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.600
And so you have this discussion, you and Steve,

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.720
and the whole team. In the stage,

01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:01.220
and the whole team with opinions.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.320
And there, you have to be harsh.

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:08.120
I wouldn't say harsh,

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.320
but you have to be very determined, right?

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.240
You know, there are two real opinion-based decisions

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.280
that happened on the iPhone.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.000
One was the keyboard.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.700
Should we have a hardware keyboard,

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.400
or should we have a virtual keyboard?

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.640
The BlackBerry was the number one

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.840
productivity messaging device of its time.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.200
It was called a CrackBerry for a reason,

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.840
because people loved it because it had,

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.640
it was easy to type and, you know,

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.880
they could get their work done.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.860
But when you're saying, we're going to move from that,

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:38.720
everyone's talking about that in the market,

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.320
and you say, we're going to move to a virtual keyboard,

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:44.760
and it's not going to work as well as the hardware keyboard,

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.920
that's an opinion-based decision, right?

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.520
Because the data is telling you,

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.440
all the best sales are over here.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.160
God, that takes guts.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.760
It takes guts, but you have to look at it

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.200
from a different point of view.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.360
And this is how I learned to come to understand this,

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.200
because I had been building, you know,

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:03.880
virtual keyboards before, and I knew, you know,

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.560
the goodness and the badness in them, right?

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.180
But he was like, look, those are productivity devices.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:12.860
We're making, ours is born out of an entertainment device

01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:14.860
and productivity, right?

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:16.980
We need to show full screen videos.

01:25:16.980 --> 01:25:19.980
We are going to have apps, not apps, but our apps,

01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:22.340
the Apple apps, because there were no app store yet,

01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:23.460
are going to take over the whole screen.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.460
You want a full screen web browser.

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:27.660
You don't want one that's like half of the device

01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:28.580
is just a keyboard.

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:30.540
Maybe you don't need that keyboard in every instance.

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:32.380
So we want that part of the screen to change

01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.700
based on the tool you may need at the time.

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.900
And maybe it's just full view, right?

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.100
So you have to go and understand

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.620
it's a different type of device just because that's that.

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:42.220
And it's successful for that reason,

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.920
the crackberry for the keyboard.

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:46.100
That's not the only thing you're going to do with this device

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:47.940
because people only did messaging

01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:49.740
and maybe a few phone calls, right?

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.900
This was going to be so much more.

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:53.420
It was going to be an entertainment web browsing device.

01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.580
So you wanted those tools to go away,

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:58.780
but it wouldn't be as good as the hardware keyboard.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.740
So that's an opinion.

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.880
Let me give you another opinion based decision

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.740
that got turned around before it shipped.

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:07.300
Steve said, no SIM slot.

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:08.460
I don't want any slots.

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.440
We're going to make it very pure.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:13.140
Johnny was like, of course, no slots.

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:13.980
Johnny, yeah.

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:18.620
And we all looked around and go, that doesn't work.

01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.460
You can't do that.

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.300
Well, why does Verizon?

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.460
And then he would always, and this was the magic of Steve,

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.060
like when you said, no, that doesn't work,

01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:27.140
he'd go, well, why does Verizon not have any SIM slots?

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:27.980
Right?

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:29.860
They showed that you can do a mobile phone with those limbs.

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:32.420
You're like, okay, here we go.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.460
And so a few days later, we come back with, you know,

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:39.540
and so product marketing, voice to the customer,

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.500
engineering, we all come back with all the data

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.900
showing how many data networks

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:49.540
and mobile networks required SIM cards versus did not

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:50.600
and what the trends were.

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:54.860
And so we showed the data and that killed the,

01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.980
or excuse me, brought back the SIM slot

01:26:56.980 --> 01:26:59.300
on the original iPhone because we're like,

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:01.560
because he was just like,

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.460
we're going to tell AT&T to not use a SIM, right?

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.900
We're going to just tell them to do it differently, right?

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:08.580
But we were like, if we want this thing

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:09.580
to go anywhere around the world,

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.260
you want to put that friction in.

01:27:11.260 --> 01:27:12.940
People are going to move from place to place.

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.460
You know, they have different SIMs

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:16.100
because of the prices and all that stuff.

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.820
We had to show all of that data.

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:20.980
And then that opinion-based decision got turned

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.820
into a data-driven decision

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:25.500
and the SIM slot obviously showed up.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:29.860
So those are two very, at the very same time, right?

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:33.620
Opinion can hold and so can data overrule opinion

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:36.180
when data does exist for a V1.

01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.620
But at the end of the day,

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.540
you don't know what the right answer is.

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:45.540
So doing no SIM card slot

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.760
may have been the right decision.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.760
We won't know because maybe if that was the decision,

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.160
then like many times throughout Apple's history,

01:27:56.160 --> 01:28:01.160
you basically changed the tide of how technology is done.

01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:02.180
Absolutely.

01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:03.580
You never know.

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.180
Apple started Wi-Fi.

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:06.020
People don't understand.

01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:06.860
Wi-Fi came out of there.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:08.780
There was no Wi-Fi in 2001.

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.420
Apple started Wi-Fi.

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.580
And then everyone else got on board.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.220
If you look at now where we're going,

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.580
we're going to phones without SIM slots

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.940
because we have eSIMs, right?

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:21.380
And now the SIM slots becoming legacy, legacy.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:23.100
It's a legacy port.

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:25.300
That legacy port will probably be gone by

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:28.500
six, maybe 10 years.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:29.500
They'll be gone.

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.460
I'm pretty sure of that

01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:32.700
because it's so much easier for carriers.

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:34.940
They don't have to have physical things to go out.

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:38.700
So right now it's just the early days,

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:41.100
but it will happen and it will go its way.

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.180
It'll fall away, but it will take time.

01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.980
You just couldn't do it back then.

01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:47.140
So timing is essential here,

01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.820
but at the end of the day, it's opinions.

01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:49.980
And that's where the genius is.

01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.160
Sometimes the data tells you one thing,

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.960
but the data at the end of the day does represent the past.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:56.800
Exactly.

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.220
And the future may be different than the past.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:03.620
Sometimes there's wisdom in the past,

01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:06.660
and sometimes it's actually representative

01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.940
of something that should be over common.

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:12.500
Progress looks like leaving that stuff behind.

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:15.500
Like the headphone jack.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.660
Right.

01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:20.260
I mean, when different folks were getting rid

01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:23.340
of the headphone jack,

01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:26.140
boy, I would love to be a fly in the wall

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:28.060
of those discussions.

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:34.060
Oh, that was a discussion that happened almost every year.

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.460
That was an every year,

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:38.100
should we get rid of headphone jacks on the iPod?

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:38.940
Right.

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.460
When are wireless headsets gonna happen?

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:44.520
And it took years to build all the right protocols,

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:47.300
the chips, all those things to make the experience

01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:50.940
that is the iPods today, right?

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.500
To say, have the confidence,

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.660
cause Bluetooth was good, but it wasn't Apple-like.

01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.460
So that is like, we gotta make our own chips,

01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:59.020
we gotta make our own software stacks.

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:01.980
Now we have the confidence to remove the headphone jack

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.900
and actually make you pay $200 more for your iPhone

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.340
that you were just paying, cause of the headphone jack.

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:09.260
Now we've grown our revenue,

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.940
we've given a new experience to the user, right?

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.700
And ta-da, you know, and it's just, it's magic.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.020
And now the world's transformed to everyone,

01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.980
you know, moving to that, right?

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.900
But it took years to understand the problem,

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:26.780
develop the technology, and not just rush it to market,

01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.940
to get a half experience, but to get it right

01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:31.060
and refine it, then ship it.

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:33.740
And only then after it was probably four or five years

01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:38.020
in development, just like the M1 processor, right?

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:42.080
That was a work from 2008, right?

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.340
Grinding away, grinding away, grinding away,

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.060
then saying, okay, now we have the confidence

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:49.660
we're doing our own silicon for all the iPhones

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:54.700
and iPods, iPads and such.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.140
Now we're gonna turn to the Mac

01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:58.180
and make sure we have the best processor, right?

01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:01.580
Not just that we have the best integrated design team.

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.620
And then saying we're gonna, you know,

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:06.940
and then besting everyone, making sure the software is,

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.420
and the hardware is designed at the same time,

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:11.060
making sure the kernels, all those things

01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:14.660
are gonna use the best efficiency.

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:18.540
And then popping it out, and then it feels seamless.

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.380
It's magic.

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:21.900
There were no, as far as I could tell,

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:23.640
unless you were in real esoteric drivers

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.920
or something like that, it just worked.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.040
It was magic.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.480
Like the transition, it was not even a speed bump.

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:32.160
It was not even a crack in the road.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:36.440
So perhaps famously, Steve had a bit of a temper.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:41.440
Steve Jobs, would you say his particular personality

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:46.080
in this aspect was constructive or destructive

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:51.080
in the process of shaping these opinion-based ideas?

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:56.080
So in Build, I write a chapter called Assholes.

01:31:56.620 --> 01:32:01.620
Yes, and you lay out beautifully the types of assholes,

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:05.180
and maybe you could speak to the constructive

01:32:05.180 --> 01:32:08.380
and the destructive types of assholes.

01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:11.780
Okay, so there's really two delineations

01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:16.300
that I have found of, you know, real fundamental ones.

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.380
And that is, you know,

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.640
of real fundamental ones.

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:23.340
And that is, again, the why.

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:27.360
Why do I feel this person is an asshole?

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.920
Okay, they might not be.

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.700
I feel this is a person who's an asshole.

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.880
Are they motivated by their ego?

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:40.380
Or are they motivated by their mission?

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:41.600
Something they're trying to do

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.640
that's and doing in service of something else, right?

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.120
Sometimes those lines can be blurry,

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.840
but it's usually pretty clear.

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.380
When it's ego-motivated,

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.500
it's clear they're just trying to get up in the ranks,

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.620
push people down, shove people aside.

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:02.560
I think we saw a president do that on a stage once.

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:06.300
You know, I'm me, and I'm the, you know,

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:09.720
I'm the guy, right?

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.100
And I'm gonna prove it by pushing everyone away

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.500
and being nefarious or what have you,

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:18.060
either passively aggressive or aggressively aggressive,

01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:21.420
what they're doing about themselves.

01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.700
There's another one,

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:25.100
which is someone who's so attentive to detail

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:29.300
and unrelenting that they're trying to get

01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:31.700
the right things for the customer

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:33.660
or in service of their mission,

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:37.580
and they wanna make sure we fulfill those things, right?

01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.020
And they really care.

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.220
They don't micromanage all the details,

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:43.140
but they micromanage the details

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:45.980
where the customer, it touches the customer in some way.

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.940
People who work with those types of people

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:53.140
who are unrelenting and push you

01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:54.780
and might make you upset,

01:33:54.780 --> 01:33:57.940
a lot of times it's a knee-jerk reaction to go,

01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.300
they are an asshole.

01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:05.700
Get off my back, you're an ass, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:06.520
Right?

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.220
And you're protecting your ego

01:34:09.220 --> 01:34:11.060
because what's happening is that person

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:13.700
is usually pushing you beyond your boundaries.

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:18.260
They see something that we can do or you can do

01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.540
that you're just either not wanting to do

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:23.500
for whatever reason, you're not confident in that,

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:26.140
you're like, I don't wanna take the extra time

01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.900
and saying, no, we need to get that done and pushing you.

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:30.380
Okay?

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:35.380
And so when we came to those areas,

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:36.940
it wasn't just a one-on-one,

01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:39.020
it could be Steve against the team going,

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.340
we need glass instead of plastic

01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.140
on the front face of the iPhone

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:45.540
and we're going to do this.

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:48.020
And we're like, God, you know?

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:49.540
And so we did it.

01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:52.540
And he pushed us because he didn't know all the details

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.020
but he could see in our minds that we're like,

01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:57.620
yeah, we could probably, yeah, we could probably,

01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:59.640
but man, it's really putting us at risk

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:01.620
and we laid out the risks for him.

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.660
And he's like, I'm willing to take those risks.

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:04.500
We'll do that.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.540
We're like, we might be three months late.

01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.540
He's like, this is so important.

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.880
We need to stay on time.

01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:14.900
But it would be all the time, push, push, push.

01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.980
It reminds me of like kids growing up

01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:18.500
and me is growing up.

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.740
When your parents push you to make you grow

01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:23.740
beyond your boundaries, your personal boundaries

01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:25.740
and you're like, God damn it, I'm sorry.

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:28.620
But they do it for the right reasons.

01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:30.980
Now, let's see, it's not bullying.

01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:31.900
It's not about bullying.

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:33.540
It's not about demeaning.

01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:36.340
It's about either pushing you to another part

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:37.540
of the mission that needs to get done

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.620
or it's about critiquing your work,

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:41.020
but not judging you.

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:41.860
Yes.

01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:43.820
Well, there's a lot to say there.

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:46.740
So one, it's fascinating.

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.420
It really is fascinating.

01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.920
And you laid out a very nice picture,

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.920
but it does feel like there's sometimes gray areas,

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.140
which is why it makes all of this very complicated.

01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:59.500
So one question I have for you in terms of glass

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:04.500
on the iPhone, how important is it that,

01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:08.700
like Steve in that case is right?

01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.700
Because I could argue each side,

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.880
it seems like in one sense,

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:18.220
just having a strong vision and opinion

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.820
is already going to make everybody grow,

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:22.940
even if it turns out to be the wrong.

01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:25.900
As long as you are sort of standing your ground,

01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:31.740
Napoleon invading Russia or something in the winter,

01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:35.380
like it's just not gonna be a good idea.

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:39.140
It's not a good idea, but I'm gonna hold to that.

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:41.700
And then once you decide, you go all in.

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:44.100
And then from that, even if the whole team knows

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:46.860
it's the wrong decision, just sticking by it,

01:36:46.860 --> 01:36:50.420
powering through, you will learn through the pain of it.

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:51.560
Everybody will learn.

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:53.040
So that's one side.

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:58.040
The other is maybe the asshole, the vision-driven asshole

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.600
gets to be more and more of an asshole

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:06.800
if they have a track record of through that process,

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:10.480
having built people up, having made the correct decisions.

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:13.000
They can't, they're not allowed to be an asshole.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.560
They're in rare air and no one can challenge them, right?

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.680
Steve was never that.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.880
That's the great thing.

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.680
He was never unchallengeable.

01:37:22.680 --> 01:37:23.520
You could challenge him.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.900
Now let's, now this, the plastic to glass story

01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.840
is a perfect example of this.

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:33.200
So at the beginning of the project,

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.620
well before we were going, we had always had these things

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:39.620
about plastic front iPods, these kinds of things,

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:41.620
you have scratches and all that stuff.

01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:49.020
So we said, are we gonna have a glass or a plastic display,

01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:50.260
a cover for the display?

01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:52.600
Cause the display was glass underneath it.

01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:57.140
We argued back and forth about glass versus plastic.

01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:00.760
And then we all landed together on plastic.

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.700
Okay, the original decision was plastic.

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:08.820
And the reasons were, okay, we don't wanna make a mistake.

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:13.820
Glass can break, you know, people drop them all the time.

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.820
So we don't wanna have a fragile device

01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:19.980
because you're gonna be using even more

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:22.380
than a music player, right?

01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:24.580
And you're gonna be holding your head

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:27.820
and putting in your pocket and misses and all that stuff.

01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:30.260
So we went down the road with plastic.

01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:33.660
When it was shown, when the product was shown

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:38.660
at Mac World in 2007, the first time, that was plastic.

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:44.860
We had just enough of them in the field at the time.

01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:48.760
We started to start seeing light scratches on the plastic.

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.280
Reviewers who didn't have the device yet

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:54.640
because it was behind glass.

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:58.120
If you remember 2007, the Jesus phone comes up

01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.480
and no one could even touch them.

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.080
You could just look at it in this

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:02.960
beautiful museum quality box.

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.760
Like it came from the future or whatever, the past.

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.360
It was like, oh, and you just looked

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.620
and that was all you got.

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:11.760
But then people said, well, what screen is,

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:14.120
what covers on that, you know, reviewers who knew better,

01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.320
you know, and then it's plastic.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.520
And they were like, really?

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.840
And so there was enough of a doubt there.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.400
And then when we started to do it,

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.000
and then Steve changed the frame of reference

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.560
of the question or of the result

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.160
of what the customer would think.

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.920
And he was like, if we designed it with plastic

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.480
and it's in their pocket all the time

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.040
and it gets scratched by coins, lightly scratched

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:41.700
or by keys or something like that, that is a design problem.

01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:44.240
We need to fix the, that was our bad.

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:49.760
If they go off and drop it or even slightly drop it

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:54.560
and it cracks, it's the customer's fault.

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.320
And they have much lower, they have less likelihood

01:39:58.320 --> 01:39:59.160
to complain.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.720
Yes, they'll complain, but they're part of that,

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:04.640
of that failure.

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.480
Yes.

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.760
Oh, that's fascinating.

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:07.720
And then-

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.760
That's true to that.

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:09.740
Right?

01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:12.000
Because then they were part of why it failed.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.840
Whereas the design, they didn't do anything wrong.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.680
It was just sitting in their pocket and it's, you know,

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.600
it's scratching and that's normal use.

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.040
Abnormal use has been dropping and we're like,

01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.280
oh, now we get it.

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.080
And so we all moved to that mindset

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.420
when you framed the problem and the solution in that way

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:34.220
versus the original framing where we all landed on plastic.

01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.220
So, and then he was unrelenting on that,

01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:41.200
but we all had moved and we have moved mindset

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:45.680
and we understood the why and we marshalled together.

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:48.880
And then by the end of June, and it was crazy,

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:52.720
the mechanical product design teams, sourcing,

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:55.520
all of us, the partner Corning,

01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:57.520
pulled together to make that happen

01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:00.200
because it was the right reason, right?

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:03.320
So this, you know, you look at these stories

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:07.040
and you hear just the top line rumors of the takeaways,

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.040
but that's not usually how it all happened

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.240
of like one leader was, that's not how Steve was.

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.000
Now I've seen leaders who are just pounding, you know,

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.160
and just had no real empathy for the team

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.200
and understanding the why.

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:21.120
And it's just, it is the way I want it, right?

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.680
I am the supreme leader.

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:25.760
That wasn't like that when-

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:27.720
He just had a very strong opinion.

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.400
Very strong opinion.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:30.920
But it was challengeable.

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.420
It was challengeable and if you came with the right thing,

01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:35.720
you know, it was, you could, you could modulate that,

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.160
but you had to come with a team.

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.600
It couldn't just be you and it had to become a team

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.640
and data and to overcome

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.280
because it was a very strong opinion.

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.560
And there's personal quirks of character.

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:46.560
Like you said-

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.840
Bad days and good days.

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.680
Bad days and good days.

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:51.360
So there's also the three options you said,

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.240
you noticed that the third option

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.520
is always going to be the one that's picked.

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.440
You're right, sure.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.280
Those kinds of-

01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.120
Idiosyncrasies.

01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.520
Idiosyncrasies.

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.840
And that, so that brings up another thing.

01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.720
You said challenge the idea, not the person.

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.520
You know, I'm somebody who has a, you know,

01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:15.560
I have a temper, I use colorful language and so on.

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.240
When I'm on teams, I work.

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:19.440
In my private life, I'm much calmer and so on.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.200
But I get, when I get really passionate

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.560
with engineering teams and-

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:24.840
I've been called an asshole.

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:29.320
And you get, I mean, I am distinctly aware

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:32.440
that you cross lines often.

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:35.800
There's like levels, right?

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.720
Sure.

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:39.280
You know, you could, it has to do with language

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.140
and how language is heard.

01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.500
So for example, you could say a lot of stuff to me.

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:44.580
You could swear.

01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:49.580
You could say stuff that sounds like, I don't know,

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:53.460
Lex, sometimes I think you're the dumbest human

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:54.700
on the face of the earth or something.

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:55.780
I don't know.

01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:57.460
This sounds very personal, right?

01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:58.900
But I'm not gonna take that personally.

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.440
I understand what's being said.

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.560
And then I also noticed that there's other people

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.260
that take stuff more personally.

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:07.220
This has to do with teams and figuring out like,

01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:10.140
okay, who's going to take certain words personally and not,

01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:11.020
and you have to know.

01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:13.660
That's what makes a great coach, a great leader,

01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:17.060
a mentor, you have to factor all that in.

01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.900
But it just, there's something about just being an asshole

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.880
and being passionate and really driven

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.020
that sometimes you do cross lines.

01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:30.380
And that's, I don't know what to do with that

01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.700
because it feels like it comes with the territory.

01:43:32.700 --> 01:43:36.340
Like you have, it seems like you can't just have

01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.940
a perfectly optimized-

01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.180
No, no, absolutely not.

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.020
We're humans, we're humans.

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:45.180
We don't have a program, everyone's programmed the same way

01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:48.700
to react the same way to given stimulus, right?

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:53.460
So you said, I don't know if this was a real example,

01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:55.740
but you said, oh, you're the dumbest human on earth

01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.620
or whatever.

01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:00.060
I would never say that, absolutely never.

01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:02.540
And if someone said that to me or I saw someone else

01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:06.220
say that to another person on the team, absolutely not.

01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:08.700
That is not allowed because that's judging someone.

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:11.180
You may be heated and you can get heated

01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.260
and you can say it in your intonation,

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.740
but to then try to put a label on it

01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:18.380
and put a label on a person, that is not allowed.

01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:21.020
So if you let that kind of culture happen

01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.580
and it becomes somewhat,

01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:26.780
you know, sometimes it's ingest.

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:28.460
You know, it has to be very much ingest

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:30.540
and those two people have to have a really good

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:31.900
working relationship.

01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:33.740
But other than that, I'm sorry,

01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:37.260
it's gonna be a lot more, you could say,

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:39.740
in that way that you're not gonna add that stuff in,

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.300
but you can do it with all other types of ways

01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:45.500
without saying that because then people who do react

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.460
to that kind of language and don't have those shields

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:51.740
because they might not have that stream confidence level

01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:54.340
that you do and you can just brush it off,

01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:56.940
that can be very cancerous in a team

01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.940
because people then mean that.

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:01.220
And then they see, oh, that's the right way to be.

01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:05.460
You gotta snuff that out and you gotta be that change

01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:07.980
or that model that you wanna show the team.

01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:10.660
Yes, it's too, even if it doesn't affect me,

01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:14.180
it's going to affect a significant enough fraction

01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:17.260
of brilliant people where that shouldn't be

01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:18.100
part of the culture.

01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:20.220
Exactly, and other people see that happen

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.740
and then, oh, I guess that's acceptable, right?

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.620
Just like politics in the workplace,

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:26.140
is that acceptable or not?

01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:29.140
I call it out exactly when I see it in front of everyone,

01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:32.820
right, because it's just another ego-driven thing.

01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:35.660
You have to set the tone as a leader

01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:37.620
for what you want your organization to be

01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:39.940
and how it gets reflected in the world

01:45:39.940 --> 01:45:41.180
and you have to uphold that.

01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:44.940
And sure, you can have an excursion outside of that,

01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:47.180
but you have to go back and say, I'm sorry.

01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:49.140
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:51.420
You have to go and apologize, heal and say,

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:53.700
I was not the person I wanted to be that day,

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.260
I'm really sorry.

01:45:55.260 --> 01:45:56.100
Yeah.

01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:59.420
And even in front of the team and have that humility

01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:00.780
and say, we're all human here

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:01.740
and just because I'm the leader

01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:03.460
doesn't mean I don't make mistakes.

01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:06.620
So have the self-awareness, apologize.

01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:07.780
Exactly.

01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:10.260
And that's also part of the culture.

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:12.340
Oh, yeah.

01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:16.900
How are you different from Steve as a leader and designer?

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:20.340
So you've spoken about sort of what made you strong,

01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.180
which is he was able to challenge,

01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:26.060
he was able to push you to bring out the best.

01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:28.500
Well, I come from the technical angle, right?

01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:33.260
Deep technology, software, hardware, systems thinking,

01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:35.180
implementation, all that stuff.

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.340
So I have a different bent.

01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:38.820
He wanted to be an engineer, started,

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.980
but really he was much better at all the other things,

01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:43.540
the storytelling, the interfacing

01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:45.780
and being the voice of the customer

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:48.020
and being that product marketer in a way, right?

01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:49.180
That we talked about.

01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:51.580
I grew into being the product marketing, the marketing.

01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:53.980
He came really out the other way, right?

01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:55.620
And never got really deep technically.

01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:57.620
So that's two different mindsets.

01:46:57.660 --> 01:46:58.860
One's not better or worse.

01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:00.180
It's just, that's how it is.

01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:02.460
And it takes all kinds to,

01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:05.100
and all kinds can do great designs.

01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:06.700
Did it manifest itself differently,

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:09.940
just the fact that you came from those different places?

01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:10.780
Absolutely.

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:14.540
Like what, so like the discussion about glass

01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:17.220
on the iPhone was probably had a different flavor to it.

01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:18.060
Sure.

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:20.380
When you started getting into the technical details,

01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:23.340
enough so you're getting the third order technical details

01:47:23.340 --> 01:47:25.740
and he can't argue with that anymore.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.020
And then with somebody, he's like, okay.

01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:30.940
At some point he's like, I can't win this war.

01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:32.820
And he learned that very early on

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.940
because he didn't like the way the look

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:39.540
of the Macintosh board, the PCB was laid out.

01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:41.580
He wanted it to be beautiful on the outside

01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.580
and on the inside.

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:45.020
He's like, why are all these wires running this way?

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:47.340
Why doesn't it have all this symmetry?

01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:49.580
And we have to make it beautiful on the inside.

01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:52.180
And even the traces on the boards

01:47:52.180 --> 01:47:53.620
have to look a certain way.

01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.620
So the teams made the board they knew that would work

01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:59.740
and then they made the board that the way Steve wanted it

01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:01.060
and that didn't work.

01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:03.940
And then Steve instantly figured out like at some point,

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:06.020
don't micromanage every single detail.

01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:07.820
There's some things he doesn't know enough about

01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:09.100
and so he would get out of that.

01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:11.260
But that was one of those instances

01:48:11.260 --> 01:48:13.380
where he pushed really hard and that's his opinion.

01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.540
So they said, okay, we're gonna make it

01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.740
a data driven decision and we're gonna make both.

01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:19.020
I'm gonna show you the results, right?

01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:21.500
And then from there, he didn't get into those details.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:25.220
So from that, you could have a great challenge, right?

01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:26.740
Because then you could get those data and say,

01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:28.540
we can't do that and let me show you why,

01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:29.660
or we can do that.

01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:31.180
And then Steve would go, you can't do that.

01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:33.180
And you're like, oh, we can do that, let me show you, right?

01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:34.860
So there's certain times when you were like

01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:36.460
bringing something to reality

01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.340
that he didn't think could exist, right?

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:42.820
So it was always that creative tension,

01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:46.340
that interaction that was so successful, right?

01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:48.500
I think, but there was one other fundamental thing

01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:51.940
that was different and that it graded on the team

01:48:52.980 --> 01:48:56.580
and that I made sure and I learned from to not do

01:48:56.580 --> 01:49:00.740
and I maybe overdo now in the opposite direction,

01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:04.700
which is when there's a great idea that comes from the team,

01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.900
acknowledge that person and go, that is a great idea.

01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:11.140
As the leader, the opinion driven, that's a great idea.

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:13.260
Let's build on that, let's see if that can do that.

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:15.540
Or it's a great idea, but not for now, put it aside.

01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.940
But call out when people have great ideas

01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:19.420
because it's infectious.

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.140
And that means maybe not ideas

01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:22.980
that come bubble up to the customer level,

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:24.500
but inside the organization,

01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.380
people like they get rewarded for their ideas

01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:27.780
and say, that's a great one.

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:32.940
Steve was always like, you give an idea

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:37.460
and he would go, hmm, okay, I don't know.

01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:39.020
The next day, 24 hours later,

01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:40.900
it would come back with slight modifications.

01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:43.900
I've had this genius idea, right?

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:46.780
And sooner or later we'd look around the table

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:49.300
and we'd roll our eyes and go, here we go again.

01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:53.380
So it demotivates you from generating ideas a little bit.

01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:55.140
Well, we got used to it.

01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:59.660
But later on in the team, it was just not,

01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:02.180
it doesn't want to bring the best, right?

01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.780
Because if you're always like, the reaction is never,

01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:07.620
that's a genius idea.

01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:11.220
It was always like, it was either negative or neutral.

01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.260
Right?

01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.860
Then it doesn't have that same emotional effect

01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:17.860
that you want you to bring your best.

01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:18.700
Yeah.

01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:20.300
Sometimes it's fun when people get excited about ideas.

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.820
You kind of build on top excitement it could be,

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.860
but coupled with sort of harshness when the idea is bad

01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:28.860
and you call out the bad ideas too.

01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:30.820
So it's the good and the bad.

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:34.020
Oh, you can say, you don't have to say bad ideas.

01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:35.620
You say, maybe not now.

01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:37.020
Let's table that for later.

01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:37.980
Let's discuss it.

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:40.580
Or say, that's a decent idea,

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:42.140
but did you think about that idea this way?

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:43.860
Not just no or yes,

01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:46.900
but let's talk about why that might not be applicable

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.940
in this case so that they can learn.

01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:50.780
So the next time they bring the next idea,

01:50:50.780 --> 01:50:53.060
they can modulate and understand to start seeing

01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:55.060
through the opinion-based decision makers

01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:56.180
or the databases to bring it

01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:59.500
and bring better formatted arguments or ideas

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:02.340
so that you have better chance of success the next time.

01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:03.180
Yeah.

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.000
Right?

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:04.900
You got to train through those moments.

01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:07.100
You got to teach those are teaching moments.

01:51:07.100 --> 01:51:08.820
Yeah, teaching for moments.

01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:10.500
I aspire to be that kind of person.

01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:14.020
I'll usually just say that idea is shit.

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.140
I remember that this brilliant person

01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:23.140
just gave that really shitty idea.

01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.700
So I remember to make sure the next time

01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:25.540
they give a good idea,

01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:27.180
I really compliment that good idea.

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.020
Exactly.

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:28.980
But I personally,

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:32.140
I mean, it's emotion,

01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:34.740
but I call out the really shitty ideas.

01:51:34.740 --> 01:51:36.580
But you should call out the really great ones.

01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:38.260
If you let the pendulum swing both ways,

01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:40.180
then everybody goes, he's balanced.

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:42.060
It's always one way.

01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:42.900
That's right.

01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:43.740
Why bring any idea?

01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:45.180
I'm all about the pendulum.

01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:46.380
Right.

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:48.340
You got to have both,

01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:49.580
the joy and the pain.

01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.140
Don't just give me pain all the time.

01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:53.940
The yang and the yang.

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.900
So you mentioned the glass and the iPhone.

01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:57.020
So you wanted to,

01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:59.060
not just the iPod, not just Nest.

01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:00.500
You were one of the key figures

01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:02.060
in the creation of the iPhone.

01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:04.020
What's the interesting aspects?

01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:05.540
What's the good, the bad and the ugly

01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:07.460
of the origin story of the iPhone?

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:10.620
Again, this is a Netflix series

01:52:10.620 --> 01:52:13.060
that spans multiple seasons.

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:13.900
But what-

01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:14.740
Change my flight, please.

01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:15.580
Yeah.

01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:16.420
What wisdom,

01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:19.420
what interesting memories you have from the fight.

01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:24.300
So the pain and the joy

01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:27.940
that was foundational to the iPod,

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.700
all the CDs you had to lug around.

01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:35.540
What was the pain and the joy

01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:37.380
and the vision of the iPhone

01:52:38.300 --> 01:52:39.940
in your mind and the mind of the team,

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:42.100
Steve's mind and so on?

01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:44.420
Well, there's multiple pains.

01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:45.300
You have to also look,

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:46.500
there's not just customer pain,

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.220
but there's business pain.

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:49.060
Okay.

01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:49.900
And it's about the,

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:53.140
so Apple now is getting out of that place

01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:54.460
where it was in 2001.

01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:56.540
Now people are starting to pay attention.

01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:58.500
Apple's starting to get in the culture again.

01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:00.220
It's becoming relevant.

01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:01.780
Cash is starting to flow.

01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:04.580
iPod is 60% of that,

01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:06.580
of the revenue,

01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:10.620
total revenue of Apple doing on 85% market share.

01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:11.980
You're starting to get a wind at your back.

01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:13.140
You got confidence.

01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:14.940
Like Apple had been beaten down

01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:17.380
since probably the first time the Mac was,

01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:18.780
since the Mac,

01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:21.580
it was a beaten company ever since the Mac.

01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:25.380
So we're talking 15 years at that point, right?

01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:27.900
This is the first time you're seeing like,

01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:30.980
and Steve would proudly came in front of us and said,

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:34.580
today I can tell you all of the employees,

01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:36.060
we are now out of debt.

01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:38.300
We paid off our debt.

01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:42.420
It was a joyous moment for him, right?

01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:43.740
And then ultimately for our team,

01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:47.740
because no more debt is wonderful, right?

01:53:47.740 --> 01:53:50.540
So now what you have is you have this successful thing

01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:52.340
changing the face of Apple

01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:58.060
and you hear these heavy stomping footsteps

01:53:58.060 --> 01:53:59.900
of the mobile phone industry.

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:01.060
Boom.

01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:03.380
And it's the feature phones at that time.

01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:04.540
They're adding cameras.

01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:06.220
They're adding color displays.

01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.820
They're seeing the success of the iPod and going,

01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:10.820
that's just music.

01:54:10.820 --> 01:54:12.860
We have some storage.

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:15.180
We can load music on our phones

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:18.100
and we can do what the iPod does plus more.

01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:22.420
Boom, boom, boom, right?

01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:23.340
And you're like,

01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:25.860
and how many hundreds of millions of them

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:27.140
are being sold at that point?

01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.060
It wasn't billions yet,

01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:31.380
but it was still 100 million, 200 million a year.

01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:32.420
iPod hadn't gotten there.

01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:36.740
It was 20, 40, 50 million, something like that.

01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:37.820
So now you're like, okay,

01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:41.300
what are we gonna do about this Goliath

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:44.620
who wants to take our lunch, right?

01:54:44.620 --> 01:54:46.540
The schoolyard bully.

01:54:46.540 --> 01:54:50.180
And so there was one, let's partner with them.

01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:54.380
So iTunes Music Store was there.

01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:57.020
All of these phones are gonna need music.

01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:00.780
So they can come to the iTunes Music Store

01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:02.260
and get that music for those phones

01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:04.420
because it wasn't just about the hardware player

01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:05.380
at that point.

01:55:05.380 --> 01:55:07.620
It was about the software that you need on the desktop

01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:10.100
and the content that you needed to download.

01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:12.660
So now Apple had multiple legs of the stool

01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:14.740
as Steve would always refer to it.

01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:16.700
So now the mobile phone industry,

01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:18.940
okay, we're gonna work with them.

01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:22.620
They are going to make an iPod shuffle basically

01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:27.180
inside of a phone, can have 99 songs total

01:55:27.180 --> 01:55:28.820
and they're gonna come to our store

01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:31.220
and you're gonna, and it's like, okay, great.

01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:32.300
It's all gonna be well and good.

01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:35.020
And that became the Motorola Rocker Project.

01:55:35.940 --> 01:55:38.460
It was Apple, Motorola getting together.

01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:41.340
There's gonna be software on this smartphone

01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:43.140
or not smartphone, but feature phone

01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:45.500
to hook to iTunes to get your music.

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.780
It wasn't even downloadable over a cloud or anything

01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:49.220
because that wasn't available yet.

01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:51.620
There wasn't, they have duty data networks yet.

01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:56.580
It was a disaster from the beginning.

01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:58.140
Two different cultures,

01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:01.060
two different types of leadership styles.

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:03.460
Not necessarily the most competent engineers

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:06.060
on the other side.

01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:10.380
And it turned out to be an absolute horrible disaster.

01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:11.420
I watched the pains,

01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:12.780
because luckily I didn't have to be a part of it.

01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:14.620
I watched the pains on Jeff Robbins face

01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:17.180
each time we would meet and he would be like,

01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:20.620
these guys are just, you know, like, really?

01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:21.940
Do we have to do this, Steve?

01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:24.140
And he's like, we're contractually obligated.

01:56:24.140 --> 01:56:26.700
And when it came out on the stage and Steve showed it,

01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:28.780
it was maybe a one minute, you know,

01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:31.540
Steve loves those extended, you know, like drawn up.

01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:33.580
It might've been a one minute, two minute kind of thing.

01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:35.620
And he literally threw that phone out of his hand

01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:37.420
as fast as he could, right?

01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.260
Cause it was horrible.

01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:41.500
So there was the pain of we're not gonna partner.

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.420
So if we can't partner with these guys,

01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:47.380
we have to become one of them to actually compete,

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.820
to save the thing that is bringing Apple

01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:53.220
from, you know, that 15 years of malaise, right?

01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:59.220
So then from that, we were made a prototype

01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:04.060
of an iPod plus phone, a classic with,

01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:05.860
it was an iPod, but it had a phone inside

01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:07.780
with all the music and all the other stuff.

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:11.980
And you use your headset, wired headset to do the audio,

01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:13.180
right?

01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:15.980
There was another project at the same time,

01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:20.140
cause we were doing videos in the iTunes music store,

01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:23.580
iTunes video store for music videos and movies.

01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:27.180
And it would be a full screen iPod.

01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:30.220
So instead of the classic, the way you know it,

01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:32.180
it would be full screen and it would have

01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:34.060
a virtual click wheel.

01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:36.660
It'd have a virtual like single touch touchscreen

01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:38.700
that you could scroll, right?

01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:41.900
Think of maybe an iPhone like you knew it, right?

01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:44.260
And then there was a third project going on,

01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:46.340
not in those two were going on in my team,

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:48.300
but the third project going on

01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:53.300
was the multi touchscreen technology to drive a Mac tablet.

01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:02.620
And so that Mac tablet, that touchscreen technology,

01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:04.420
there was just way too much you had to change

01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:08.220
on the software and everything to be able to use a tablet,

01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:09.060
right?

01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:09.900
We see this all the time, like people like,

01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:11.260
there's not enough tablet apps today

01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:12.620
that are modified for tablet.

01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:14.860
They're just phone apps that are grown up, right?

01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:17.460
So then they would just be Mac touch stuff.

01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:20.220
You'd have to have a whole developer community.

01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:21.660
That probably wasn't the best place

01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.500
to take that technology first.

01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:25.020
So you take that technology,

01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.660
marry it with the full screen iPod

01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:28.300
and the phone stuff we were working,

01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:30.980
because the iPod phone with the rotary dial

01:58:30.980 --> 01:58:32.540
was just like a rotary phone.

01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.860
We couldn't make that interface work well for data input.

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:40.300
You put those three together and now is where those,

01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:43.900
those three things that then created the form

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:46.260
or the technology and the form inside

01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:48.380
what would become the iPhone,

01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:51.740
married with a bunch of low level software

01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:54.500
from the iPod and manufacturer software

01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:57.380
and drivers and communication stuff,

01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:02.380
combined with a very reduced Frankenstein Mac OS.

01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:05.900
And I mean that in the best way.

01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:08.980
It means it wasn't Mac OS just changed a little.

01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:11.420
It was totally, things were hacked out and changed

01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:13.220
and new code was inserted.

01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:16.500
And it really was a whole set of things

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:20.420
from all different places to make that first iPhone OS.

01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:23.380
And then there was another team working on the apps

01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:24.980
and then another team working on the design

01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:27.580
of how it looked overall between all that stuff.

01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:29.380
So all of those things came together

01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:32.820
to create what we know as the first generation iPhone.

01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.780
And those are all probably fascinating.

01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:38.180
Engineering challenges and great teams

01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:41.420
like creating the Frankenstein OS.

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:45.140
That's fascinating because you're simplifying and simplifying

01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:47.140
but then you're just pulling different stuff from

01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:49.460
and you're basically inventing.

01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:51.220
I mean, they're probably not thinking of it that way

01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:56.020
but a new era of computing, a new kind of computer.

01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:57.220
It really is Frankenstein.

01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.620
Right, and you didn't have to run Mac software.

01:59:59.620 --> 02:00:02.220
If you look at some of the other smartphones of the time

02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:04.900
like Windows and stuff, they were like,

02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:06.860
we need to make sure it runs Excel

02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:08.700
and it runs Word or something like that

02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:09.900
in some reduced thing.

02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:10.980
This was like, no, no, no, no, no.

02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:12.740
This was born out of entertainment.

02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:15.820
So we didn't have to go and take all the same application,

02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:19.220
you know, all those other ones was about compatibility.

02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:21.740
This was about a whole new way of being.

02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:26.580
What did you think about the Steve Jobs presentation

02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:31.580
of the iPhone, the sort of the first iPhone, you know.

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:34.460
Phone, internet communicator and the iPod in your pocket.

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:38.020
Yeah, they are going to sort of present the,

02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:41.380
announcing three new products kind of thing

02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:43.340
and then saying that it's all in one.

02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:44.940
Just, this is a good example,

02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:49.940
one of the sort of historic presentations of a product.

02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:55.060
Clearly there's like some showmanship that works,

02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:56.780
some reason it works.

02:00:56.780 --> 02:00:59.580
It doesn't always work, it often doesn't work

02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:02.820
but it did in this case and often did for Steve.

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.940
What, like, how did that feel?

02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:08.380
What part of the actually,

02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:13.460
the design process was that presentation?

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:14.300
You know what I mean?

02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:17.140
Like from the early, because you said consider the why,

02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:19.460
the press release at the very beginning.

02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:21.300
Steve was doing that the entire time.

02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:24.620
He was working on that story from day one.

02:01:24.620 --> 02:01:27.140
He was pitching us this, this, this and then this

02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:29.300
and then he would look at our faces

02:01:29.300 --> 02:01:31.380
because you wouldn't, most people wouldn't,

02:01:31.380 --> 02:01:32.780
at least if you're working for him,

02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:34.260
wouldn't tell him what you really thought

02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:37.100
of what he was saying but he would look at your faces

02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:39.300
and then he would talk to a few real trusted

02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:44.220
confidence outside of the organization

02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:45.940
and see what they thought, right?

02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:47.620
And they could give him feedback on it

02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.260
and they could really challenge him

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:51.500
but he would also look at their faces and go hmm.

02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:53.860
And so when you see that, hmm,

02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:56.220
then he would modulate it and change it slightly

02:01:56.220 --> 02:01:59.060
and change it, so he was working during all of that time

02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:01.500
on the story and the storytelling, right?

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:03.020
And the whys.

02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:04.900
Well, we're working on that and helping us refine it

02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:08.580
just like the switch from plastic to glass, right?

02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:10.220
All the time working on that.

02:02:10.220 --> 02:02:12.140
So when he comes out on stage,

02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:15.740
he does something that every marketer is told not to do.

02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:18.220
Say, these three things are now combined in one.

02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:23.060
That is like the, they say that that is the laziest form

02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:26.860
of storytelling possible for marketing, right?

02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:28.060
Yeah. Right?

02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:31.300
But it was the best one because it was all those pains.

02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:35.340
It was like, I want my iPod but I want my communications

02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:36.820
and I want my internet browsing

02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:38.900
because I want it on the go so I can look up things

02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:40.780
because it was in information.

02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:42.860
And when you were on the road, you had a laptop,

02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:45.700
you had an iPod and you had a phone that,

02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:49.100
and you had to carry all of these things with you at once.

02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:51.700
Now we're gonna solve that pain for you

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:52.980
and put it all together.

02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:54.460
So he was just showing you the pain

02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:55.900
and building that virus of doubt and going,

02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:57.940
it's now in this one magical thing.

02:02:57.940 --> 02:03:00.820
And he could come up and masterfully tell that story

02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:03.700
because he told it almost every day

02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:06.900
to all of these people inside very quietly.

02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:09.340
And then it was just, right?

02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:12.460
It was like a Tony award-winning play

02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:14.700
that had been worked on for 10 years.

02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.020
But also the human came through of timing.

02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:18.540
It was all that, it was all that.

02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:20.700
And of course he was dramatic at certain points

02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:23.860
and he would raise his voice and a wry smile

02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:25.180
or whatever it was.

02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:26.620
It was all those touches.

02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:29.180
He was an actor as well as a storyteller.

02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:30.020
Yeah.

02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:32.660
But it was the truth, right?

02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:34.020
The truth came through.

02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:36.500
It was a non-fiction story.

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.460
And then he added those personal flourishes on top of it

02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:41.180
for dramatic effect.

02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:43.780
It's amazing.

02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:50.300
So there's a designer you mentioned, Johnny Iave.

02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:55.620
You both are brilliant designers, great human beings.

02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:59.220
There were some battles fought in the distant past

02:03:59.220 --> 02:04:00.540
between the two of you.

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:04.060
Looking back, what is the positive characteristics

02:04:04.060 --> 02:04:07.180
of Johnny that made you a better person and designer

02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:08.340
having worked with him?

02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:18.660
Watching the process that the design team that Johnny led.

02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:22.100
I don't know where, cause that was over years.

02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:23.500
I didn't see all of those things.

02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:26.260
But watching the design process of really,

02:04:26.260 --> 02:04:29.900
cause it was really a team that was about materials.

02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:31.420
It was about form.

02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:32.700
It was about colors.

02:04:32.700 --> 02:04:35.660
It was about these physical characteristics.

02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:38.820
When we talked about this early was design.

02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:39.660
What is design?

02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:41.060
Design's everywhere, okay?

02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:43.740
So what they were really focused on was form,

02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:47.740
how the feel was, how it looked, the aesthetics,

02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:49.140
the physical aesthetics.

02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:53.220
And watching, going through that process,

02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:55.420
I learned so much in that process.

02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:59.940
About how to do colors, how to do materials,

02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:04.940
how to think deeply about curves, right?

02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:10.060
And shadows and how it would look, not just in your hand,

02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:12.140
but how it would look in the photograph

02:05:12.140 --> 02:05:14.860
you were gonna take for marketing, right?

02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:19.260
So how it would look, how you would feel, all of it.

02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:23.660
It was all of those physical things around that

02:05:23.660 --> 02:05:26.460
and watching the process to get there.

02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:31.260
That was enlightening for me, right?

02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:35.060
It opened my mind to go, oh, okay.

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:37.260
Just like there's a process for all these other things,

02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:39.820
it wasn't just magic and you say,

02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:42.660
ha, ha, ha, there it is.

02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:45.100
It was really a process of refinement,

02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:46.780
of opening the funnel at the beginning

02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:51.580
and refining down over time to get to that final mile

02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:53.580
and selecting and doing the selection.

02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:55.180
And certain types you could,

02:05:55.180 --> 02:05:58.980
certain times there were opinion-based design details.

02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:02.100
But a lot of data-driven designs

02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:05.460
of what can we deliver in volume?

02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:06.660
What can we do different things?

02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.740
So you always had these constraints

02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:09.700
that you had to work with under.

02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:13.100
And sometimes they and the team,

02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:14.900
not just I, would say, we need this.

02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:16.940
And we're like, we can't deliver that.

02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:18.820
But maybe we were able to work together

02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:20.860
to find different design characteristics

02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:23.300
and different implementation characteristics

02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:25.500
that could get to that point

02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:27.540
without what they were describing.

02:06:27.540 --> 02:06:30.820
And instead of, yes, yes, yes, no, no, no,

02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:34.540
let's find some other way to solve the problem together.

02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:39.540
Yeah, and I've seen this in several companies

02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:41.780
have more closely interacted with,

02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:43.500
like Tesla is an example.

02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:46.420
Sometimes, talking about curves,

02:06:47.420 --> 02:06:51.220
sometimes it's very painful on the engineering side

02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:55.420
to deliver a very specific kind of thing.

02:06:55.420 --> 02:06:59.140
And one question that comes up in my mind is like,

02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:02.980
well, how far should we go to try to deliver

02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:06.940
a tiny adjustment in a curve, in the curvature,

02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:10.460
or in whatever the form factor is,

02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:12.500
in the color of the material,

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:15.620
when the cost is like 10X to deliver,

02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:17.820
not financially, but just like in effort,

02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:20.860
like how many problems do I have to solve?

02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:26.460
I don't know if you can say any wisdom to that,

02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:29.260
because when you're thinking about curves,

02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:31.340
you're designing in the space of ideas,

02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:34.420
you're like platonic forms kind of thing,

02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:39.420
not always grounded to like how much pain

02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:41.020
is gonna be involved in delivering this,

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:44.260
but that's as you should, perhaps,

02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:46.620
because then if you're always thinking

02:07:46.620 --> 02:07:49.980
about the pain required to deliver this thing,

02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:51.260
you'll be too conservative,

02:07:51.260 --> 02:07:53.100
you wouldn't do the wild ideas.

02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:56.860
Right, exactly, but you have to understand,

02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:58.380
again, the why behind it.

02:07:58.380 --> 02:08:01.700
And at Nest, when we had limited resources,

02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:04.700
putting a screwdriver in the box,

02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:07.580
a custom designed screwdriver in the box

02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:10.060
was born out of those experiences I had at Apple,

02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:12.460
and seeing how you can create something

02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:15.220
that's emotional, it's part of marketing,

02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.820
and it's part of the product experience overall,

02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:20.380
even though it seems extraneous.

02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:23.340
I went back and made the design team

02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:25.740
and the mechanical team change some curves

02:08:25.740 --> 02:08:28.260
on the Nest Protect, the smoke and CO detector

02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:32.020
we did at Nest, after they had already tooled it.

02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:33.260
And I said, they're saying this cost more,

02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:35.380
I said, it doesn't look right.

02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:37.700
There is a, but they're like, oh, well, we had,

02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:39.300
I said, no, you're gonna go back

02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:40.460
and you're gonna make that change.

02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:43.020
I told you we needed to do it.

02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:45.580
We had a better looking model, that is gonna get done.

02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:48.780
I know it's gonna be a terrible cost to you,

02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:50.620
but we already had this discussion,

02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:52.220
and that's the way it's gonna have to be.

02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:55.060
And I'm sorry, but it is what it is.

02:08:57.020 --> 02:08:58.900
Because it's better for the customer

02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:00.780
and it looks better in the pictures and all the other stuff.

02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:02.220
And then we did it and it was great.

02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:04.380
And everyone agreed it was great at the end,

02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:05.820
but it was pain to get there.

02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:09.180
Those are where, those little details

02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:11.140
are where the magic comes out, right?

02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:15.700
And if you don't do, if you don't take those pains

02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:19.020
and put in the love, the customer's gonna feel,

02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:20.860
it's gonna, they're either gonna feel the pain

02:09:20.860 --> 02:09:23.900
or they're gonna feel the love if you put it in, right?

02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:27.060
So it depends on how much time and effort

02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:30.180
you wanna put into something and what really matters to you

02:09:30.180 --> 02:09:32.540
and so how you communicate what you do.

02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.180
We're human beings after all.

02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:36.980
Is there something you've learned

02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:40.580
from sort of the tensions that are natural

02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:43.220
or that happen in teams when they're passionate

02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:45.500
and they're trying to solve these problems?

02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:47.300
Is that the way of life?

02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:49.860
And there's the human drama?

02:09:49.860 --> 02:09:54.380
Is that just, is that always, is that, it is what it is?

02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:56.060
Does that make you better, actually,

02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:58.940
the drama, the tension between personalities

02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:00.260
and all that kind of stuff?

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.540
Look, a roller coaster ride without ups and downs

02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:05.520
is no fun.

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:08.000
It's the journey.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.040
It's the journey that brings,

02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:12.280
it brings out the best in everyone.

02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:17.200
We're forged, we're tempered by those experiences,

02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:19.760
not all the ups, but also the downs

02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:22.080
and that's when you get the humanity and the connection

02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:25.160
and we can tell these stories till we're blue in the face

02:10:25.160 --> 02:10:28.800
and smile every time because we did something together

02:10:28.800 --> 02:10:30.680
that we, each of us couldn't do apart,

02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:32.160
but when it comes together,

02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:34.040
that's where all the emotions happen

02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.720
and that's where, if it's born out of the right reasons

02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:38.580
and the right story and the right way,

02:10:38.580 --> 02:10:41.640
that's where the magic happens, not just for the customer,

02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:45.320
but for how it transforms each person who is working on it

02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:48.480
and they will never forget those experiences in their life,

02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:51.320
positively and negatively, that happened at the time,

02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:53.760
but they look back and it's only positive

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:55.720
because they did something that mattered.

02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:00.440
Yet another brilliant idea that you brought to life

02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:05.440
is Nest, Nest thermostats and the big umbrella of Nest.

02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:13.120
Again, as part of this Netflix series, season three,

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:17.840
what was the most memorable, the most painful,

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:22.840
the most insight-laden challenge you had to overcome

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.740
to bring Nest to life?

02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:29.740
Well, the first thing for me was making someone care

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.580
about their thermostat.

02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:39.580
No one considers it.

02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:41.660
They never had any customer choice.

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:43.180
They didn't install it.

02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:44.500
They usually don't even use it

02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:46.540
because it's so complicated or what have you.

02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:48.780
They just like, they bitch at it.

02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:50.500
They hide it in the corner

02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:54.260
and then they just pay the bill of whatever it is.

02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:58.140
It's totally unloved, unconsidered, right?

02:11:58.140 --> 02:12:00.720
So how do you wake up, like I said, the virus of doubt,

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:03.460
how do you wake that up and get people going,

02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:04.860
remember every day when you go in

02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:06.580
and it's like, you're just frustrated

02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:08.060
and then you get the bill and you pay the bill.

02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:08.900
So you have to do that.

02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:10.060
So that was one thing.

02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:13.020
I think the other big one was not delivering,

02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:14.100
all of it was hard, right?

02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:15.020
It was constrained.

02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:16.300
We had only so much stuff.

02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:17.740
We were bootstrapped.

02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:19.120
We didn't have massive funding.

02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.220
We didn't get hundreds of millions of dollars.

02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:22.380
But we did it for the right reasons.

02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:25.460
But I think the other big part of it was

02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:27.740
not just building a disruptive product

02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:29.700
because a lot of the people on the team had done that.

02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:32.940
We knew what we were doing and that was,

02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:35.700
if we got the design right, we could deliver it

02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:38.780
with enough time.

02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:42.980
It was getting the disruptive go to market.

02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:44.900
In other words, how to take that product

02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:46.780
from the end of the production line

02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:49.420
and get it into the customer's hands

02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:53.780
because there was no retail or customer choice

02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:54.940
in thermostats.

02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.780
No one even, it was never considered purchase.

02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:00.060
They never thought they had choice.

02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:03.420
Some guy, usually in suspenders and a butt crack,

02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:07.220
told them, looked around, looked at their house and said,

02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:09.940
this looks like somebody who's got as well to do.

02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:13.100
This thermostat is now gonna cost you $350.

02:13:13.100 --> 02:13:14.580
Thank you very much.

02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:17.100
And you're like, I'll take whatever you give me, right?

02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:18.800
And then it goes into another house,

02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:21.720
it's worth $100, it was the same damn thing, right?

02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:23.320
So there was no price transparency.

02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:24.360
There was no choice.

02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.640
You just got what you were given.

02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.760
So how do you go, and this was an entrenched industry,

02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:34.280
that's why there was no innovation in it

02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:35.600
because it was doing just fine

02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:37.800
because every house needed them.

02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:40.600
All the installers were programmed

02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:45.600
by the product deliverers, by bonuses

02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:49.360
and bonuses to say, you're gonna only carry our product

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:50.520
and if you sell this many,

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:53.600
you're gonna get a free trip to Hawaii, right?

02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:54.760
And for these guys who install,

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:58.160
I get a free trip to Hawaii, that's dream for them, right?

02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:00.640
So this whole channel was fully controlled

02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:01.880
by the product guys

02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:04.000
and it was almost monopolistic in a way.

02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:07.080
So how do you go around that?

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:11.200
So creating a disruptive go-to-market channel,

02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:13.000
one was direct to consumer, right?

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.640
And all the marketing that was necessary

02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:17.840
to get that message across.

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:20.840
Another one was getting the installation right.

02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:24.480
No one was self-installing thermostats.

02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.280
So how do we get enough people who are early adopters

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:30.640
to be able to self-install them confidently

02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:32.920
so they didn't still have to call the guy

02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:34.400
to come and install it

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:36.320
because then he would say, this is a crap product.

02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:38.400
No, I got the much better product, right?

02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:40.720
So you had to get rid of that friction.

02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:42.840
And then ultimately, how do you get the people

02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:44.520
who were not just early adopters,

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:45.800
but people who needed to see it

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:47.520
and touch it before they bought it?

02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:49.520
How do you get that into retail

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:53.160
when the large brands of the time of thermostats

02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:55.680
in Home Depot and Lowe's had contracts

02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.480
that they couldn't bring in any other brands?

02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:00.340
They were owning the channel all the way

02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:04.240
to where there was any sort of slight customer choice.

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:07.920
And it was really contractor choice more than it was

02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:09.300
and consumer choice.

02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:13.580
So all of that had to be innovated along with the product.

02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:15.500
And so to me, that was a huge challenge

02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:17.340
and something I had never done,

02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:18.500
most of us had never done,

02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:20.680
and we had to create,

02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:21.980
that was as much as a project

02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:24.620
as actually delivering the product itself.

02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:28.540
So it turned out to be a giant hit.

02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:33.540
And it was acquired by Google for $3.2 billion

02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:38.540
as a founder and leader just out of curiosity,

02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.720
in these cases of acquisition,

02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:44.700
is it always a good thing?

02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:47.580
Is there any part of you and the team

02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:49.980
that considered saying no?

02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:52.000
Oh, we considered saying no

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.720
all the way along the process, right?

02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:56.720
We had all been in big companies before.

02:15:58.020 --> 02:16:01.060
We knew what it was like and the politics

02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:02.220
and all the other stuff.

02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:04.020
And what I came to learn,

02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:07.540
from Phillips, because Phillips was a very,

02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:09.900
it was 375,000 people, it was a big,

02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:11.840
it was massive company, right?

02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:13.380
And tons of politics.

02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:15.340
And I was like, do we want to go back into that work?

02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:17.980
Because I had so many negative experiences from that.

02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:22.300
But then going to Apple, which was not big,

02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:24.700
but it was big enough that it could have all these dynamics.

02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:26.620
But then when you saw a leader rise up

02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:28.260
and get rid of those dynamics

02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:31.400
or not allow many of them to flourish,

02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:34.980
then you're like, oh, with the right leadership,

02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:37.860
this can be a beautiful marriage, right?

02:16:37.860 --> 02:16:40.980
And so for four months, we were working together with them,

02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:43.940
with Google, to make sure that we had the right leadership

02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:45.620
and we were gonna be in the right environment

02:16:45.620 --> 02:16:46.760
that it felt right.

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:49.100
So that happened.

02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:50.100
It absolutely happened.

02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:51.340
We worked on all the details.

02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:53.220
We didn't even talk about price.

02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:55.620
We were talking about how's the brand gonna work?

02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:56.780
Who's the team gonna work with?

02:16:56.780 --> 02:16:58.420
How are we gonna get IP?

02:16:58.420 --> 02:16:59.540
How are we gonna do exchanges?

02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:01.540
How are we gonna get budgets and all that stuff done?

02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:02.540
So we worked through all of that

02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:04.340
before we actually sealed any kind of deal

02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:05.860
because they were already investor in the company.

02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:09.300
So we already knew, they knew relatively where

02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:12.020
the endpoint was for the price.

02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:14.300
So working through all those prerequisites,

02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:20.180
I knew that as a individual product company

02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:22.820
that was trying to create a platform,

02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:25.140
no investors were gonna invest in a platform

02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:27.340
that could take three, four years

02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:30.380
and many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to build

02:17:30.380 --> 02:17:33.540
without all kinds of new products at the same time

02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:35.980
and products that we were having, which were successes,

02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:37.600
but they weren't even breakeven yet, right?

02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:39.460
We were still developing them.

02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:41.980
So how are we gonna get more people to fund

02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:44.100
all of these things and this platform

02:17:44.100 --> 02:17:46.080
that I really wanna create?

02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:48.180
Because my worry, and I had seen this many times

02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:51.180
in Silicon Valley, is these small startups have bravado

02:17:51.180 --> 02:17:54.620
and they said, I'm gonna take on the big guys, right?

02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:55.740
With a platform.

02:17:56.860 --> 02:17:59.020
But when those platform guys show up

02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:00.860
and Apple says they're gonna get in the,

02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:04.180
at the time, nobody cared, they were curiously,

02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:06.260
guys curious, what's next, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:07.940
But Apple wasn't in the market,

02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:09.980
Google wasn't in the market yet,

02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:12.940
Amazon wasn't there, Microsoft, Samsung,

02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:16.840
they were not, they were all just, that's curious, right?

02:18:18.020 --> 02:18:21.740
And I had watched, if you said, I'm gonna go challenge them

02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:23.500
and I'm gonna build a platform,

02:18:23.500 --> 02:18:25.300
and then they all of a sudden one by one go,

02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:26.900
oh, well, we're building a platform now,

02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:29.340
we're building a platform, they fighted you to death,

02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:32.060
fear, uncertainty, doubt, and the developers run away

02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:33.140
and you can't make that platform.

02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:36.460
So I'm like, before the landscape gets changed on us,

02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:37.980
because we're tracked so much attention,

02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:39.020
they announced something,

02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:42.480
we need to change the landscape on them.

02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:46.220
Let's go to the best place where we can build out

02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:49.420
the platform, have the right leadership behind us,

02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:51.540
to help us grow this thing into what the vision

02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:52.500
it should be.

02:18:52.500 --> 02:18:54.240
And that's what we believe we were doing

02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:55.840
with the Google acquisition.

02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:00.640
Is it possible to take on the platforms?

02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:03.400
So you said there's a lot of startups with bravado

02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:04.880
and all that kind of stuff.

02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:08.160
Doesn't mean, James Joyce when he was 20 said,

02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:11.420
I'm gonna be the greatest writer of the 20th century,

02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:14.720
before he wrote anything of value.

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:17.600
One of them might be actually right.

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.000
Yeah, in this modern world, when you,

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.120
so first of all, people should definitely get your book

02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:31.120
built as just this giant number of advice

02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:36.320
on this exact question of how to build cool things,

02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:38.440
how to build a startup, how to,

02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:41.720
all the different stages of that, team and hiring.

02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:43.080
It's mostly human nature.

02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.080
It's not technical.

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.760
It's mostly human nature behind it.

02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:49.400
Turns out it's turtles all the way down

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:51.160
that's human at the bottom.

02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:56.160
Yes, so is it possible to build startups

02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:58.800
that take on the big guys?

02:19:58.800 --> 02:20:01.160
Whatever that is of the modern era.

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:05.440
So for now it's these platforms of Apple, Google, Twitter.

02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:08.480
I don't even know, Meta I guess called now.

02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:09.560
Sure.

02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:11.360
Is it possible to take them on?

02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:12.740
Absolutely.

02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:15.240
But you don't take them on on their same turf.

02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:17.800
You take them on on the turf they're gonna want to have

02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:20.040
in the future, right?

02:20:20.040 --> 02:20:21.560
Spotify is a platform.

02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:26.000
It started as an application, is now a platform, right?

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.240
Think of WeChat.

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:30.300
Think of all the super apps out there

02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:33.560
that are now wallets and delivery services

02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:37.240
and travel services and transportation services

02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:38.440
all within an app.

02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:40.880
They've innovated in a different level,

02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:44.000
in a different space that the platform companies weren't.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:49.440
Google was an app company.

02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:51.160
It was solving search.

02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:53.000
And then it became a platform company.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.240
Apple was solving personal computing

02:20:55.240 --> 02:21:00.240
and then iPhone was solving internet browsing,

02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:03.160
all that stuff, and then became a platform company

02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:04.440
when the App Store was added.

02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:06.520
If you look at it, there's no such thing

02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:07.680
as building a platform company.

02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:11.220
You build a great app first and then you can expand it

02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:13.220
and have the right to become a platform.

02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:19.240
Your whole book is just a bunch of advice for young people

02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:21.480
and older people.

02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.240
Well, everyone is young at heart.

02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.360
And if you're not, you should be.

02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:28.200
So in terms of picking a career,

02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:29.800
you have advice on this point.

02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:32.480
What advice would you give to a person

02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:34.240
on how to pick a career?

02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:37.400
What is it you want to learn

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:39.440
and who is it you want to learn from?

02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:41.240
Just like when you pick a university,

02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:44.920
you're like, I want to go here for this expertise.

02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:47.800
I've heard about these programs, especially graduate,

02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:49.960
graduate studies.

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:52.720
You go for a certain program with a certain set of people.

02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:56.560
Why don't you do that when it comes to a job?

02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:58.480
You just don't go, or in a career,

02:21:58.480 --> 02:22:00.960
you just don't go and say, I just want to go work at Google

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:02.520
or I just want to work at Apple.

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:04.340
You want to go to a certain team

02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:06.740
with a certain set of people and work with them

02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:09.000
on something that you're really curious about

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:10.520
and you want to learn about.

02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.040
That's such, I just want to sort of comment that,

02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:17.160
that's such a, it's a subtle but a brilliant framing

02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:21.220
just ask the question, what do I want to learn?

02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:27.320
And then see what career path is going to maximize that.

02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:31.040
That's so interesting.

02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:34.120
It's the first question I ask anyone who interviews with me.

02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:36.720
When I say I'm going to bring somebody on the team,

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:39.600
first question is, what do you want to learn?

02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:41.920
I don't want the expert, like we talked about earlier,

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:43.600
says, I'm the expert in this.

02:22:43.600 --> 02:22:46.080
You're going to hire me as the expert.

02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:47.680
We're doing something new.

02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:50.200
You're not an expert because we're not an expert either.

02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:51.600
What is it you want to learn?

02:22:53.720 --> 02:22:58.560
And on the topic of learning,

02:22:58.560 --> 02:23:00.680
what is the best way to learn?

02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:06.920
What starting, you go into this new place,

02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:10.720
into this new world, into maybe V1,

02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:12.280
you said you're building V1.

02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:17.080
I mean, the whole world is full of V1s

02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:20.400
or V0s waiting for the V1 to come along.

02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:21.240
Zero to one.

02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:22.160
Zero to one.

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:25.580
What's the process of that look like?

02:23:25.580 --> 02:23:27.140
What's the process of learning?

02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:29.920
How do you learn?

02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.760
Well, let me put a framing

02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:34.560
and then we'll talk about that last piece.

02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:38.020
I have now looking back, especially writing this book,

02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:40.960
I have a version one of myself, a version two,

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.400
a version three, a version four.

02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:46.700
I had a lot of opinions about myself

02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:47.540
and what I wanted to do.

02:23:47.540 --> 02:23:50.280
Sometimes those opinions for certain people,

02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:52.160
those opinions are formed

02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:54.120
and they get the data from their parents

02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:55.880
and they go do what their parents told them to do

02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:57.480
or their surroundings.

02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:59.640
My opinions was like, I want to go and learn this.

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:00.600
I'm curious about that.

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:02.520
I made the zero to one move.

02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:05.360
And then over time, by doing,

02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:07.000
I was refining those things

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:08.600
and learning what I was really curious about

02:24:08.600 --> 02:24:10.320
and what I was really good about

02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:11.880
because I was getting data.

02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:14.320
And then I was like, then I had another set of opinions

02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:16.520
to create version two of me.

02:24:16.520 --> 02:24:17.600
And then I would go and do it.

02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:19.880
So I was learning by doing.

02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:21.120
Starting with the opinion,

02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:22.640
you're not gonna get any facts.

02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:24.240
Most people are like,

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:27.280
where do I make the most money for my position?

02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:28.920
They're trying to start with data.

02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:32.620
Start with the why.

02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:33.840
What's your curiosity?

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:35.540
What do you want to learn?

02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:37.400
And then follow that.

02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:40.040
I took the lowest job on the totem pole

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:42.680
at General Magic

02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:43.600
because I wanted to get in there

02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:44.920
to work with the right team.

02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:46.760
I didn't even know what they were doing.

02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:49.600
But I thought that it felt right.

02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:53.640
I was barely living above the power line

02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:55.720
working there, working 80 hours a week

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:57.920
because it was so amazing to learn,

02:24:57.920 --> 02:24:59.360
just like a college student.

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:00.880
That's what I was doing.

02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:03.800
And then I learned more from that

02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:06.200
and then changed those opinions into data.

02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:07.880
And then I found other opinions.

02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:09.340
So it's the same thing.

02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:11.820
But it was by doing, right?

02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:13.820
The way you find out what you want to do in life

02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:16.620
is by figuring out what you don't want to do.

02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:18.020
And the only way you find that out

02:25:18.020 --> 02:25:19.380
is by doing a bunch of stuff.

02:25:19.380 --> 02:25:21.860
Doing a bunch of stuff and refining it.

02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:22.780
That's hilarious.

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:23.940
Yeah, that's brilliant.

02:25:24.860 --> 02:25:27.260
So in terms of the career path

02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:29.660
of leaping into the startup world

02:25:29.660 --> 02:25:31.580
and launching a startup,

02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:35.340
what does it take to successfully found a startup

02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:37.780
to have a chance to succeed?

02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:41.860
And maybe how do you decide

02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:44.740
to take that leap?

02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:49.220
Is there sort of having founded,

02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:52.660
having been part of many V1s,

02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:55.660
many of some of the most successful V1s ever,

02:25:56.700 --> 02:25:58.900
what's it take to take that leap?

02:25:58.900 --> 02:26:01.100
Maybe leave your job,

02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:06.460
cushy job at a company and do the startup.

02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:07.380
What does it take?

02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:10.900
It takes belief in yourself.

02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:12.420
That's the first thing.

02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:13.620
Belief that you can do it.

02:26:13.620 --> 02:26:17.580
Not, but hopefully with mirrors or mentors around you

02:26:17.580 --> 02:26:19.540
or coaches around you to make sure you know

02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:21.340
you're not crazy.

02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:23.060
It's a crazy smart idea,

02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:26.140
but you're not crazy and you're just working on something

02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:29.840
as like a lone mad man or woman, you know.

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:32.900
You have a great idea.

02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:34.900
And like I said, great ideas chase you.

02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:37.740
You can, in this world,

02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:39.540
there are so many people who have more ideas

02:26:39.540 --> 02:26:41.700
than they have time to implement.

02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:42.940
I used to be like that.

02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:44.820
I would like, oh my God, I have this idea, this idea.

02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:47.380
And then you do, you try to do all of them,

02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:48.700
but the best ideas are the ones

02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:50.260
that you can really focus on

02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:52.260
and you shut out all those other things

02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:53.380
and you bring them other ideas

02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:54.940
into the thing you're trying to do.

02:26:54.940 --> 02:26:58.020
So I try to run away from a great idea

02:26:58.020 --> 02:26:59.940
and then it stalks me.

02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:01.900
It hunts you down because you're like,

02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:03.580
ah, that's gonna have this problem.

02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:05.300
And I'm gonna put it aside.

02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:08.780
And then all of a sudden, you know, a few days later,

02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:10.540
oh, I think I know how to solve that problem.

02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:11.740
Or I talk to somebody

02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:15.100
and you just always kind of niggling around the edges

02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:17.220
at it and then at some point it's like,

02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:19.800
it just becomes, it becomes like this black hole

02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:21.000
that just sucks you and you're like,

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.380
I can't think about anything else but this.

02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:26.440
It's almost like a relationship in the world, right?

02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:29.660
You know, when you have it with a, you find your partner.

02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:33.140
You know, you're like, hmm, hmm, Wade, hmm, something.

02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:36.800
And then all of a sudden it just, it comes together, right?

02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:37.820
It's kind of like that.

02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:39.000
Ultimately achieve focus.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:39.940
See, I'm different.

02:27:39.940 --> 02:27:41.260
I just dive right in.

02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:42.260
I used to do that too.

02:27:42.260 --> 02:27:43.660
I used to dive right in.

02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:44.500
Yeah.

02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:46.060
But I learned that you need time.

02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:47.300
It's more effective to run away from it.

02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:49.620
Run away from it and so it chases you

02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:52.500
because it makes you think harder about that story.

02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:53.900
This is not dating advice.

02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:55.220
We're talking about startup.

02:27:55.220 --> 02:27:56.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:27:56.060 --> 02:28:01.060
But ultimately, so you have achieved a focus on it.

02:28:02.060 --> 02:28:05.420
But you also said to believe in yourself.

02:28:05.420 --> 02:28:06.900
That's not necessarily even the idea.

02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:11.900
It's the human that believe in the human being.

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:15.580
You have to believe in yourself and the idea that you have

02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:17.820
because if you don't have that belief,

02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:20.460
then you can't project that to other people

02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:21.740
to say, join the team.

02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:26.940
Let me ask you, because you mentioned mentors

02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:30.180
and you've talked about having had incredible mentors

02:28:30.180 --> 02:28:31.020
in your life.

02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:34.660
You're also a mentor to a very large number of people.

02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:36.580
What does it take to find a mentor?

02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:39.260
How do you find a great mentor?

02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:41.780
Usually they also find you.

02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:44.340
Is it like with the ideas?

02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:46.860
No, no, no, no.

02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:48.980
No, what happens is you're in the right,

02:28:48.980 --> 02:28:51.100
you have a community around you, okay?

02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:53.700
And because you've been building a network,

02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:55.140
because you can't do it alone.

02:28:55.140 --> 02:28:57.140
So you have to create this network around you

02:28:57.620 --> 02:29:00.220
of relationships that don't, not transactions,

02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:02.820
but relationships over time that you really cherish

02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:04.900
and people you talk to, okay?

02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:09.520
And you share vulnerable or nascent ideas with

02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:13.300
or crazy opinions with, and then you argue them through.

02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:18.300
But you start to see resonate and it's not about age.

02:29:18.380 --> 02:29:20.620
It's just about this connection, right?

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:23.020
I have mentors, obviously when I was young,

02:29:23.020 --> 02:29:25.420
all my mentors were older and as I get older,

02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:28.380
I have mentors who are younger than me or the same age,

02:29:28.380 --> 02:29:30.260
right, they're not all just older, right?

02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:32.380
And so it's about that connection.

02:29:32.380 --> 02:29:35.020
It's about being on that same wavelength,

02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:39.140
but they also, they can counterbalance you.

02:29:39.140 --> 02:29:41.180
They compliment you in some way.

02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:43.740
Like my best mentors had nothing to do with technology.

02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:46.660
They didn't know anything about technology, right?

02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:47.740
The way we know it.

02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:49.860
They were all about human nature and they could reflect that

02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:53.500
and help me get more human focused and more empathetic

02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:56.460
because I was so detailed in the technology.

02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:58.780
I needed to see from other perspectives,

02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:01.140
but then they wanted to learn more about the technology,

02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:03.340
right, or they thought that this idea was so great

02:30:03.340 --> 02:30:04.800
that it should exist.

02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:06.680
Now let's work together on that.

02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:08.940
So it's really, they have to find you

02:30:08.940 --> 02:30:11.700
and you have to find them and that's by sharing.

02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:14.900
You just don't go and look it up on the internet

02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:16.700
and say who are the best mentors in the world.

02:30:16.700 --> 02:30:18.620
It just doesn't work that way.

02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:21.140
So form a network of people and see where,

02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:24.020
I mean, it's like finding relationships, finding love,

02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:25.620
all that kind of human nature.

02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:29.860
Venture capitalists, money.

02:30:29.860 --> 02:30:33.420
Do VCs help or hurt a business in general?

02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:35.100
So like in those early stages

02:30:35.100 --> 02:30:37.300
in the chase of developing a V1,

02:30:37.300 --> 02:30:42.300
just what's the constructive and destructive power of money

02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:45.340
in the development of a brilliant idea

02:30:45.340 --> 02:30:47.660
and the deployment of a brilliant idea?

02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:51.620
I have seen brilliant venture capitalists.

02:30:51.620 --> 02:30:54.240
I have seen horrible ones.

02:30:54.240 --> 02:30:56.900
Ones that care about their LPs more

02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:59.540
than they care about the entrepreneurs.

02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:01.900
Of course, everyone's in it, at the end of the day,

02:31:01.900 --> 02:31:03.260
especially venture capital,

02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:06.260
they have to give a return to their limited partners,

02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:07.800
the people who invest in money

02:31:07.800 --> 02:31:10.300
that they have to shepherd that money

02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:12.940
and make sure it's watched over properly.

02:31:12.940 --> 02:31:15.500
But when there's not a balance, a pushback

02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:18.860
in a venture capitalist between what the LP needs

02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:21.380
and what the entrepreneur needs

02:31:21.380 --> 02:31:24.020
and that the entrepreneur might be trying really hard,

02:31:24.020 --> 02:31:25.260
but if they don't see,

02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:27.860
the VC doesn't see the exit's gonna happen in two years

02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:30.380
and they just leave them hanging,

02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:33.720
when the value exchange is only money

02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:37.320
and not mentorship or ideas or other things,

02:31:38.220 --> 02:31:40.820
when there's not a relationship, but really a transaction,

02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:43.640
that's when money is toxic.

02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:44.900
Because you can get money everywhere.

02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:48.380
Maybe it's a little harder today over the last month,

02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:50.580
but you can still find people with money

02:31:50.580 --> 02:31:54.540
who are on that, who wanna enable your mission

02:31:54.540 --> 02:31:57.980
and can be mentors, not always, not all of them,

02:31:57.980 --> 02:32:01.520
but some of them can be mentors, but they're on your side,

02:32:01.520 --> 02:32:03.460
then it's incredibly powerful

02:32:03.460 --> 02:32:06.080
because it's not just one plus one equals two, right?

02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:07.600
It's something bigger than that.

02:32:07.600 --> 02:32:09.740
Because then they can bring their networks of people

02:32:09.740 --> 02:32:11.280
and their networks of companies

02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:12.660
and other people they worked with

02:32:12.660 --> 02:32:17.140
that might wanna join your mission, right?

02:32:17.140 --> 02:32:19.620
That's the kind of venture capitalists

02:32:19.620 --> 02:32:22.100
and smart money that's out there, right?

02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:23.980
But you have to build a relationship.

02:32:23.980 --> 02:32:26.060
People go, oh, look at that valuation.

02:32:26.060 --> 02:32:29.860
Oh, it's the brand name of the VC that's investing in me.

02:32:29.860 --> 02:32:32.860
No, it boils down to who's that partner

02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:34.660
and how experienced are they?

02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:37.720
Don't just give me the brand, give me the person,

02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:40.060
because that's the person I'm gonna be interacting with.

02:32:40.060 --> 02:32:42.020
I have to, man, there's a million questions

02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:46.740
I wanna ask you, but we're on season five already.

02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:50.620
But let me ask you, it seems like out of all

02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:51.700
the brilliant things you write about,

02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:53.060
it seems like not an important question,

02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:55.380
but the fascinating one to me is lawyers.

02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:59.640
You write about this, so does a company need lawyers?

02:33:00.540 --> 02:33:01.460
And why?

02:33:03.580 --> 02:33:04.420
And what kind?

02:33:04.420 --> 02:33:06.980
So you write about sort of the value of this game,

02:33:06.980 --> 02:33:08.460
I guess, it's a game.

02:33:08.460 --> 02:33:09.300
It's a legal game.

02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:14.620
Why do we need lawyers?

02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:16.180
You sound exasperated by lawyers.

02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:17.980
I don't have a good question, I guess.

02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:21.340
Well, because- The why of lawyers.

02:33:21.340 --> 02:33:23.180
The why of lawyers, yes, exactly.

02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:25.060
Okay, the why of lawyers.

02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:26.380
Thank you.

02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:27.620
You even do the question.

02:33:29.980 --> 02:33:32.060
We just have to put why in front of everything you ask

02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:33.220
and then we'll be there.

02:33:33.220 --> 02:33:34.060
Lawyers, why?

02:33:34.060 --> 02:33:34.900
Why.

02:33:34.900 --> 02:33:37.100
Even mafiosos had lawyers.

02:33:37.100 --> 02:33:42.100
Okay, you know, Tony Soprano, you know, Scarface,

02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:46.980
all of them had lawyers, right?

02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:47.940
Why?

02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:49.700
Because there are things in this world

02:33:49.700 --> 02:33:53.300
that you don't always consider in the government,

02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:58.020
in laws, in competitors,

02:33:58.020 --> 02:34:00.340
because you're so focused on what you're doing,

02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:03.660
they have to watch out for you, right?

02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:05.700
Now, the best kind of lawyers are the ones

02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:08.940
who try to work with you to enable what you're doing

02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:11.660
and see gray areas.

02:34:11.660 --> 02:34:13.140
Law is not black or white.

02:34:13.140 --> 02:34:15.340
It's how it's interpreted, right?

02:34:15.340 --> 02:34:17.660
And so they can help interpret things a certain way

02:34:17.660 --> 02:34:20.020
or help push on things a certain way

02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:22.460
to get change to happen or allow change to happen.

02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:24.060
Because if you have lawyers who are always,

02:34:24.060 --> 02:34:26.460
just like you were talking about PR people,

02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:28.340
if you have lawyers who are always saying no to everything,

02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:30.780
because their job is to really say no or maybe,

02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:32.660
they'll never say yes.

02:34:32.660 --> 02:34:35.060
And you also say, their job is to say no

02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:36.340
and bill you by the hour.

02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:38.380
Exactly, exactly.

02:34:38.380 --> 02:34:40.220
Depressing. Right?

02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:41.060
Yeah.

02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:42.340
If you don't wanna know, don't ask them,

02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:44.180
because you're gonna get a no or maybe a maybe.

02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:45.180
And you'll get charged for it.

02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:47.660
And you'll get charged for it anyways, right?

02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:52.380
So to have a partner, to have them on your team,

02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:55.020
to help you see maybe some of the things you don't see,

02:34:55.020 --> 02:34:58.260
some consequences, they help to rein that in

02:34:58.260 --> 02:35:00.180
or change your language.

02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:02.260
Like, are you gonna get sued for this ad?

02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:06.100
Just change this one word and it helps, right?

02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:07.740
So you need to have a partner.

02:35:07.740 --> 02:35:10.900
Most of the times, especially engineers or designers,

02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:12.740
they see lawyers as only stifling.

02:35:13.860 --> 02:35:15.420
Lawyers can actually, if you do it right

02:35:15.420 --> 02:35:16.700
and you have the right type,

02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:19.060
they can actually open up a whole new world for you

02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:20.540
because of the interpretation

02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:22.900
and how we go about doing things.

02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:23.740
So-

02:35:23.740 --> 02:35:25.540
And they help you not get bogged down

02:35:25.540 --> 02:35:28.540
in the pain of little mistakes that didn't mean anything.

02:35:28.540 --> 02:35:29.820
Exactly, you shot yourself in the foot

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:30.660
and you didn't even know it.

02:35:30.660 --> 02:35:33.620
You didn't even know you were carrying the gun.

02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:36.780
Just to jump around, Charles Bukowski once wrote,

02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:39.700
find what you love and let it kill you.

02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:44.140
So the question is about work-life balance.

02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:46.540
That's like finding an idea, let it chase you.

02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:48.580
Yes, but a little more aggressive.

02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:54.340
So what does work-life balance look like

02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:59.340
that maximizes success and or happiness?

02:35:59.620 --> 02:36:02.420
Is there such a thing as work-life balance?

02:36:02.420 --> 02:36:05.020
Is, can you speak to this?

02:36:05.020 --> 02:36:07.340
When your work is your life,

02:36:07.340 --> 02:36:10.220
and I mean that in the positive sense,

02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:13.020
when you're on a mission that really matters

02:36:13.020 --> 02:36:15.940
and you know that you can really affect

02:36:15.940 --> 02:36:18.100
not just yourself but other people's lives

02:36:18.100 --> 02:36:21.420
and then that is very rewarding, right?

02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:25.300
That's not work, that's like I said, a mission, right?

02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:27.340
You adopt that.

02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:30.220
But that said, you still need to have boundaries yourself.

02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:32.260
At General Magic, wonderful documentary,

02:36:32.260 --> 02:36:35.100
if no one's seen it, you gotta see that, it's amazing.

02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:37.260
I was physically and mentally unhealthy,

02:36:37.260 --> 02:36:38.700
socially unhealthy as well

02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:42.100
because I put every waking minute into this thing,

02:36:43.140 --> 02:36:44.660
every ounce of me into it.

02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:48.900
And when it was a spectacular disaster,

02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:51.140
we were making the iPhone 15 years too early,

02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:55.660
the bottom fell out, I had nothing left.

02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:59.820
I had to get healthy socially, emotionally, physically

02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:03.220
after that, that trauma.

02:37:03.220 --> 02:37:04.500
I let everything go.

02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:06.900
I learned from that that you have to,

02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:09.580
even though you might put everything into your work,

02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:11.860
you need to find balance outside of it.

02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:14.260
Now that doesn't mean you're always,

02:37:15.220 --> 02:37:16.980
it's three days a week working

02:37:16.980 --> 02:37:19.140
and four days a week or whatever it was,

02:37:19.140 --> 02:37:21.260
you're still working as hard as ever,

02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:23.340
but what you're doing is you're making sure

02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:26.060
your thinking time is during work,

02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:28.100
that you're not ruminating at three in the morning.

02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:31.300
You use the tools that you have to put those ideas

02:37:31.300 --> 02:37:34.260
into databases or on pages or somewhere else

02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:36.500
so you can go back and look at them.

02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:37.940
So you're not always having to remember

02:37:37.940 --> 02:37:39.340
because what happens is most people don't write

02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:40.340
this stuff down.

02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:41.820
So they just sit there and I gotta remember this,

02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:43.860
I gotta remember this, I gotta remember this.

02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:45.460
If you just put it into the tools

02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:48.020
and you can come back to it, you can come back fresh.

02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:49.660
A lot of the time is about ruminating

02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:52.700
about what I need to get done and remembering everything

02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:54.300
instead of doing the work.

02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:56.340
That's fascinating.

02:37:56.340 --> 02:37:58.100
So if you just put it down on paper,

02:37:58.100 --> 02:38:00.300
you can actually escape it.

02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:03.140
Escape it for a time, to have peace for a time.

02:38:03.140 --> 02:38:03.980
You mentioned

02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:08.140
General Magic.

02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:10.580
Let me ask you the Russian question.

02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:13.220
The Russian question.

02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:14.900
What's been the

02:38:16.660 --> 02:38:20.140
the darkest moments of your life?

02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:21.660
What are some of the darkest places

02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:22.860
you've gone in your mind?

02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:26.020
You've talked about if you're doing these kinds of things

02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:28.940
with startups, you're gonna have to face a crisis.

02:38:28.940 --> 02:38:29.780
Right, absolutely.

02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:31.380
If you're doing it right, you're gonna face it.

02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:33.380
So for you personally,

02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:37.420
where were some of the tougher moments in your life?

02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:38.260
Growing up,

02:38:40.140 --> 02:38:42.180
I went to 12 schools in 15 years.

02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:45.420
I was always the new kid.

02:38:47.340 --> 02:38:49.300
Put yourself in those shoes, right?

02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:51.460
What were you picked on?

02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:53.660
Well, absolutely, but even more so,

02:38:53.660 --> 02:38:55.740
I was the geek with the computer.

02:38:55.740 --> 02:38:57.740
Remember the nerds in the 80s?

02:38:57.740 --> 02:38:59.540
You probably don't know this, but believe me,

02:38:59.540 --> 02:39:01.180
we were made fun of.

02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:02.820
What were these computers?

02:39:02.820 --> 02:39:03.660
What were these things?

02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:04.980
You're off in a cold.

02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:07.420
They're all off partying or going whatever it was,

02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:09.300
and I'm sitting there like.

02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:12.620
They're like, this guy is just this alien, right?

02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:16.140
Who's this new guy who just showed up and then,

02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:17.980
you would ask the smart questions

02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:20.300
and you couldn't be the smartest in the,

02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:22.620
because then you get picked on too.

02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:23.700
And you're the new kid.

02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:26.340
So you're in this environment that's ever-changing,

02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:29.860
you don't fit in, and you are just asking questions

02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:32.540
because you think they're the right questions to answer,

02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:34.500
but then they're like, you're making us look bad.

02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:35.580
Don't ask these smart questions

02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:37.220
because you're gonna make us do more work.

02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:40.620
So right there, it's pretty tough.

02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:41.860
And I'm moving cities, right?

02:39:41.860 --> 02:39:42.860
And I didn't have the internet

02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:44.140
to stay connected to people.

02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:45.980
There was no internet.

02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:47.700
Phone calls were $2 a minute.

02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:49.340
So it was lonely too.

02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:52.300
It was lonely, right?

02:39:52.300 --> 02:39:54.900
I was a latchkey kid, right?

02:39:54.900 --> 02:39:56.940
I had my brother, but he was a skateboarder

02:39:56.940 --> 02:40:00.700
and he had a different social way of working.

02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:02.460
He loved to do that stuff and be outside.

02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:03.540
I loved the computer.

02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:06.660
So even in the computer, you were alone in the family.

02:40:06.660 --> 02:40:09.100
Were the computer in the family you were alone?

02:40:09.100 --> 02:40:09.920
I was absolutely alone.

02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:10.760
That was just me.

02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:15.340
But then you could find the other geeks, right?

02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:16.540
But there were just a few of us

02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:18.500
and we made this little thing.

02:40:18.500 --> 02:40:20.300
But then when you moved away,

02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:23.900
then I had to use a BBS, a bulletin board system

02:40:23.900 --> 02:40:25.020
and a dial-up modem.

02:40:25.020 --> 02:40:28.000
And then I started hacking the phone system

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:32.020
to get free codes on MCI and Sprint back in the day

02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:33.300
to get long distance,

02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:35.200
to get free codes to call my friends,

02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:37.140
the geeks on the other side, right?

02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:39.380
Or to dial into a BBS cheaply

02:40:39.380 --> 02:40:41.260
that was in another part of the world.

02:40:41.260 --> 02:40:45.060
So this was this subculture and that was not accepted

02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:47.180
in any way and not the heroes that you see today

02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:52.040
that are on the richest people in the world and everything.

02:40:52.040 --> 02:40:54.300
So that was the first set of trauma.

02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:56.940
And then the next one really was general magic,

02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:59.140
the end of that, like I described before

02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:01.900
and pulling yourself out and going just,

02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:05.420
cause I got so insular in that world of geeking out

02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:09.260
and building stuff that I just tore all the social ties,

02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:10.100
right?

02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:12.980
Because it was just, it was a drug.

02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:13.980
I was hooked on that.

02:41:13.980 --> 02:41:15.500
I was a junkie.

02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:18.020
I had to get, I had to get clean.

02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:19.460
Yeah.

02:41:19.460 --> 02:41:24.260
And that made you who you are.

02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:25.100
Tempered.

02:41:28.140 --> 02:41:31.360
So Steve Jobs is no longer with us.

02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:36.380
One day you also will no longer be with us.

02:41:36.380 --> 02:41:39.780
That's the thing about this life, it ends.

02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:40.620
Yeah.

02:41:41.940 --> 02:41:44.260
So no matter how many incredible things you brought

02:41:44.260 --> 02:41:46.960
to this world, no matter how many inventions you built,

02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:49.620
you too shall perish.

02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:51.620
Do you think about this?

02:41:51.620 --> 02:41:53.740
Are you afraid of your death?

02:41:57.780 --> 02:41:59.180
I am not afraid of my death.

02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:05.920
I am an atheist and I think about the soul

02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:08.520
because I do, even though I'm an atheist,

02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:12.120
I think about the soul and the soul is the thing

02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:16.100
that you instill in others when you go that lives on.

02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:20.620
It's not this thing that's magically in space.

02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:23.440
It's the thing that you've imparted onto people

02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:26.640
that you worked with and those relationships you've had.

02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:31.440
And that soul lives on in the stories that they tell, right?

02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:34.120
And through build, I'm hopeful that those stories

02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:36.680
stay relevant because they're human nature.

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:39.360
They're not about who knows what the next iPhone thing is

02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:40.760
or the next iPod thing is.

02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:45.200
The stuff that I have been able, the privilege to make

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:48.580
and work with people, those are all ephemeral.

02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:49.840
The iPod's gone now, right?

02:42:49.840 --> 02:42:54.400
This week it was announced iPod's dead after 21 years.

02:42:56.160 --> 02:42:59.200
It is that those human connections,

02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:00.920
it's that growth that you've helped someone

02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:02.560
just like they helped me.

02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:05.000
Just like Bill Campbell or Steve Jobs is gone,

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
but they made me be better.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.160
That's the soul that I believe in.

02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:11.400
That's fascinating that you say that.

02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:14.320
Yeah, so many of these products,

02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:16.140
I mean, to push back a little bit,

02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:18.560
so even though the iPod is an end of an era.

02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:21.040
Using it every day.

02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:25.800
I think that, I mean, the number of people that impacted

02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:31.720
is just, so I suppose the soul is carried by the people.

02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:33.080
Exactly.

02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:34.800
Sometimes the products you create

02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:36.640
is the sort of the transport mechanism.

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:40.560
It's the vessel and they felt the love

02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:42.440
and they felt that love and it transformed

02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:44.560
even if they don't have the vessel anymore.

02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:46.800
Yeah, and in that way the soul lives.

02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:48.880
Just like the body is the vessel.

02:43:48.880 --> 02:43:50.600
That's beautifully put.

02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:52.240
Why do you think we're here?

02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:54.040
What's the meaning of life, Tony?

02:43:54.040 --> 02:43:59.040
Jesus, man, we're going all around.

02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:00.040
Meaning of life?

02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:01.120
Why, why?

02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:03.560
Because you said it's important to have a press release.

02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:04.400
I didn't.

02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:05.240
Okay.

02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:10.800
Humanity, if life on earth, if this thing,

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:13.840
the consciousness, the falling in love

02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:18.520
and building bridges and iPods and rockets

02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:22.080
and trying to extend out into the cosmos, why?

02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:23.680
Why do you think we're doing it?

02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:27.720
Is there any meaning to it?

02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:30.040
We are naturally curious

02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:35.040
where we are naturally curious individuals

02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:39.160
and we are always looking for meaning.

02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:42.880
We're always trying to ascribe meaning to something

02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:46.280
or understanding of something, right?

02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:50.720
And through that, it's just like evolution and Darwinism.

02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:53.720
It's just that thing that's baked into our being

02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:55.400
at the most fundamental level.

02:44:55.400 --> 02:44:56.840
Driven by curiosity.

02:44:56.840 --> 02:44:58.800
Driven by curiosity.

02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:01.440
Creating some pretty cool things along the way.

02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:03.560
Tony, and speaking of cool things,

02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:06.960
you've created some of the coolest things ever.

02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:09.480
And on top of that, you're just an amazing human being.

02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:11.720
It's a huge honor that you would sit and talk to me today.

02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:12.840
This is fun.

02:45:12.840 --> 02:45:14.360
Lex, this is great.

02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:18.160
I didn't know where I was going and I'm, let's talk.

02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:19.000
I'm looking for seating.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:19.840
I would love to.

02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:20.660
Seven, eight, nine.

02:45:20.660 --> 02:45:21.500
Six, seven, yes.

02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:22.880
Let's go hang out and have dinner

02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:24.960
and just rap about all kinds of crazy.

02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:26.520
I'd love to continue this.

02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:27.360
I would too.

02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:28.200
Thank you so much, Tony.

02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:29.600
Beautiful.

02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:32.440
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tony Fidel.

02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:33.920

02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:39.040
And now let me leave you with some words

02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:41.280
from Tony Fidel himself.

02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:43.760
The most wonderful part of building something together

02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:46.760
with a team is that you're walking side by side

02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:48.380
with other people.

02:45:48.380 --> 02:45:49.920
You're all looking at your feet

02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:52.560
and scanning the horizon at the same time.

02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:54.720
Some people will see things you can't,

02:45:54.720 --> 02:45:56.120
and you will see things

02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:58.560
that are invisible to everyone else.

02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:01.000
So don't think doing the work just means

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:02.860
locking yourself into a room.

02:46:02.860 --> 02:46:05.380
A huge part of it is walking with your team.

02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:09.320
The work is reaching your destination together

02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:11.400
or finding a new destination

02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:13.280
and bringing the team with you.

02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:17.560
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
