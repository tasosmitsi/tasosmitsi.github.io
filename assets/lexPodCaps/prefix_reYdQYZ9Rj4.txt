00:00.000 --> 00:03.660
Whatever reality is, it's not what you see.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.720
What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.920
The following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,

00:14.920 --> 00:17.900
professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,

00:17.900 --> 00:21.200
focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,

00:21.200 --> 00:23.920
visual perception, and consciousness.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.760
He's the author of over 120 scientific papers

00:27.760 --> 00:31.160
on these topics, and his most recent book titled

00:31.160 --> 00:33.280
The Case Against Reality,

00:33.280 --> 00:36.700
Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.600
I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,

00:39.600 --> 00:41.420
like those of Donald Hoffman's,

00:41.420 --> 00:43.640
attempt to shake the foundation

00:43.640 --> 00:45.920
of our understanding of reality,

00:45.920 --> 00:50.320
and thus, they take a long time to internalize deeply.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.240
So proceed with caution.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.440
Questioning the fabric of reality

00:54.440 --> 00:58.520
can lead you to either madness or to truth.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.420
And the funny thing is, you won't know which is which.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.260
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.440
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:06.440 --> 01:07.640
in the description.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.100
And now, dear friends, here's Donald Hoffman.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.320
In your book, The Case Against Reality,

01:14.320 --> 01:17.200
Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes,

01:17.200 --> 01:20.000
you make the bold claim that the world we see

01:20.000 --> 01:21.960
with our eyes is not real.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.600
It's not even an abstraction of objective reality.

01:24.600 --> 01:28.840
It is completely detached from objective reality.

01:29.720 --> 01:30.920
Can you explain this idea?

01:30.920 --> 01:33.040
Right, so this is a theorem from evolution

01:33.040 --> 01:34.200
by natural selection.

01:34.200 --> 01:38.560
So the technical question that I and my team asked was,

01:38.560 --> 01:41.420
what is the probability that natural selection

01:41.420 --> 01:44.400
would shape sensory systems to see true properties

01:44.400 --> 01:45.440
of objective reality?

01:46.280 --> 01:48.280
And to our surprise, we found that the answer

01:48.280 --> 01:51.440
is precisely zero, except for one kind of structure

01:51.440 --> 01:52.480
that we can go into if you want to.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.400
But for any generic structure that you might think

01:55.400 --> 01:59.160
the world might have, a total order, a topology metric,

02:00.280 --> 02:03.160
the probability is precisely zero that natural selection

02:03.160 --> 02:06.520
would shape any sensory system of any organism

02:06.520 --> 02:08.560
to see any aspect of objective reality.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.440
So in that sense, what we're seeing is

02:13.700 --> 02:18.700
what we need to see to stay alive long enough to reproduce.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.620
So in other words, we're seeing what we need

02:20.620 --> 02:23.500
to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.900
So the evolutionary process, the process that took us

02:27.900 --> 02:30.140
from the origin of life on Earth

02:30.140 --> 02:32.340
to the humans that we are today,

02:33.300 --> 02:37.380
that process does not maximize for truth,

02:37.380 --> 02:39.300
it maximizes for fitness, as you say.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.340
Fitness beats truth.

02:41.340 --> 02:45.020
And fitness does not have to be connected to truth

02:45.020 --> 02:46.700
is the claim.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.940
And that's where you have an approach towards zero

02:49.940 --> 02:54.940
of probability that we have evolved human cognition,

02:55.980 --> 02:58.380
human consciousness, whatever it is,

02:58.380 --> 03:00.700
the magic that makes our mind work,

03:00.700 --> 03:05.700
evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,

03:06.280 --> 03:09.220
but its ability to survive in the environment.

03:09.220 --> 03:10.280
That's exactly right.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.260
So most of us intuitively think that surely

03:14.260 --> 03:18.640
the way that evolution will make our senses more fit

03:18.640 --> 03:21.160
is to make them tell us more truths,

03:21.160 --> 03:23.000
or at least the truths we need to know

03:23.000 --> 03:26.140
about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.000
That's the standard view and it was the view I took.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.560
I mean, that's sort of what we're taught

03:30.560 --> 03:31.880
or just even assume.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.500
It's just sort of like the intelligent assumption

03:33.500 --> 03:34.760
that we would all make.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.920
But we don't have to just wave our hands.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.980
Evolution of a natural selection

03:38.980 --> 03:41.240
is a mathematically precise theory.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.240
John Maynard Smith in the 70s

03:44.240 --> 03:45.640
created evolutionary game theory.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.160
And we have evolutionary graph theory

03:48.160 --> 03:50.560
and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.400
And so we don't have to wave our hands.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.200
It's a matter of theorem and proof

03:54.200 --> 03:56.760
and or simulation before you get the theorems and proofs.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.480
And a couple of graduate students of mine,

03:59.480 --> 04:01.240
Chester Mark and Brian Marion,

04:01.240 --> 04:04.000
did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off

04:04.000 --> 04:06.520
that there was something going on here.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.000
And then I went to mathematician Chetan Prakash

04:09.000 --> 04:13.080
and Manish Singh and some other friends of mine,

04:13.080 --> 04:14.480
Chris Fields.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.020
But Chetan was the real mathematician behind all this.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.540
And he's proved several theorems

04:18.540 --> 04:21.820
that uniformly indicate that with one exception,

04:21.820 --> 04:23.860
which has to do with probability measures,

04:25.180 --> 04:28.260
there's no probability of zero.

04:28.260 --> 04:30.900
The reason there's an exception for probability measures,

04:30.900 --> 04:35.900
so-called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes

04:36.700 --> 04:38.780
is that for any scientific theory,

04:40.680 --> 04:43.420
there is the assumption that needs to be made

04:43.420 --> 04:48.420
that whatever structure,

04:48.660 --> 04:51.780
whatever probabilistic structure the world may have

04:51.780 --> 04:55.540
is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure

04:55.540 --> 04:56.380
of our perceptions.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.420
If they were completely unrelated,

04:57.420 --> 04:59.620
then no science would be possible.

04:59.620 --> 05:04.620
So this is technically the map from reality to our senses

05:05.140 --> 05:07.060
has to be a so-called measurable map,

05:07.060 --> 05:08.660
has to preserve sigma algebras.

05:08.660 --> 05:10.380
But that means it could be infinite to one

05:10.380 --> 05:14.340
and it could collapse all sorts of event information.

05:14.340 --> 05:15.180
But other than that,

05:15.180 --> 05:18.980
there's no requirement in standard evolutionary theory

05:18.980 --> 05:22.460
for fitness payoff functions, for example,

05:22.460 --> 05:25.580
to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.100
So you can ask the technical question.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.180
This is one of the avenues we took.

05:30.940 --> 05:32.940
If you look at all the fitness payoffs

05:32.940 --> 05:37.940
from whatever world structure you might want to imagine,

05:37.940 --> 05:40.440
so a world with, say, a total order on it.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.100
So it's got N states and they're totally ordered.

05:44.100 --> 05:48.140
And then you can have a set of maps from that world

05:48.140 --> 05:50.580
into a set of payoffs, say from zero to 1,000

05:50.580 --> 05:52.540
or whatever you want your payoffs to be.

05:52.540 --> 05:56.260
And you can just literally count all the payoff functions

05:56.260 --> 05:58.140
and just do the combinatorics and count them.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.820
Then you can ask the precise question,

05:59.820 --> 06:02.180
how many of those payoff functions

06:02.180 --> 06:04.860
preserve the total order, if that's what you're looking,

06:04.860 --> 06:07.300
or how many preserve the topology?

06:07.340 --> 06:08.820
And you just count them and divide.

06:08.820 --> 06:13.220
So the number that are homomorphisms versus the total number

06:13.220 --> 06:16.140
and then take the limit as the number of states

06:16.140 --> 06:18.260
in the world and the number of payoff values

06:18.260 --> 06:19.940
goes very large.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.660
And when you do that, you get zero every time.

06:21.660 --> 06:24.400
Okay, there's a million things to ask here.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.900
But first of all, just in case people are not familiar

06:28.900 --> 06:32.160
with your work, let's sort of linger

06:32.160 --> 06:35.660
on the big bold statement here,

06:36.540 --> 06:39.460
which is the thing we see with our eyes

06:41.060 --> 06:45.060
is not some kind of limited window into reality.

06:45.060 --> 06:47.900
It is completely detached from reality,

06:47.900 --> 06:49.620
likely completely detached from reality.

06:49.620 --> 06:51.280
You're saying 100% likely.

06:52.620 --> 06:57.620
Okay, so none of this is real in the way we think is real.

06:57.820 --> 07:00.040
In the way we have this intuition,

07:00.040 --> 07:05.040
there's like this table is some kind of abstraction,

07:05.320 --> 07:07.880
but underneath it all, there's atoms.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.880
And there's an entire century of physics

07:09.880 --> 07:12.040
that describes the functioning of those atoms

07:12.040 --> 07:13.720
and the quarks that make them up.

07:13.720 --> 07:18.720
There's many Nobel prizes about particles and fields

07:19.840 --> 07:23.320
and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up

07:23.320 --> 07:25.200
to something that's perceivable to us,

07:25.200 --> 07:27.720
both with our eyes, with our different senses

07:27.720 --> 07:29.960
as this table.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.560
Then there's also ideas of chemistry

07:33.640 --> 07:38.640
that over layers of abstraction from DNA to embryos,

07:38.640 --> 07:42.980
the cells that make the human body.

07:42.980 --> 07:46.680
So all of that is not real.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.360
It's a real experience

07:48.360 --> 07:52.600
and it's a real adaptive set of perceptions.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.240
So it's an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.080
We want to think that-

07:57.080 --> 07:58.680
So the perceptions are real.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.760
So their perceptions are real as perceptions, right?

08:01.920 --> 08:03.640
We are having our perceptions,

08:03.640 --> 08:06.960
but we've assumed that there's a pretty tight relationship

08:06.960 --> 08:09.000
between our perceptions and reality.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.720
If I look up and see the moon,

08:11.720 --> 08:15.160
then there is something that exists in space and time

08:15.160 --> 08:18.960
that matches what I perceive.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.960
And all I'm saying is that if you take evolution

08:24.600 --> 08:29.600
by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.880
Our perceptions are there.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.180
They're there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

08:35.180 --> 08:36.740
They're not there to show you the truth.

08:36.740 --> 08:38.780
In fact, the way I think about it is

08:38.780 --> 08:40.680
they're there to hide the truth

08:40.680 --> 08:42.540
because the truth is too complicated.

08:42.540 --> 08:45.740
It's just like if you're trying to use your laptop

08:45.740 --> 08:47.520
to write an email, right?

08:47.520 --> 08:50.280
What you're doing is toggling voltages in the computer,

08:50.280 --> 08:52.600
but good luck trying to do it that way.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.320
The reason why we have a user interface

08:54.320 --> 08:56.640
is because we don't want to know that quote unquote truth,

08:56.640 --> 08:59.600
the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.960
If you had to know all that truth,

09:01.960 --> 09:04.000
your friends wouldn't hear from you.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.360
So what evolution gave us was perceptions

09:08.360 --> 09:10.200
that guide adaptive behavior.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.000
And part of that process, it turns out,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.680
means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.700
So what's the difference between hiding the truth

09:20.700 --> 09:25.700
and forming abstractions, layers upon layers of abstractions

09:26.580 --> 09:31.580
over low level voltages and transistors and chips

09:32.860 --> 09:37.740
and programming languages from assembly to Python

09:37.740 --> 09:40.420
that then leads you to be able to have an interface

09:40.420 --> 09:44.060
like Chrome where you open up another set of JavaScript

09:44.060 --> 09:47.380
and HTML programming languages that lead you

09:47.380 --> 09:49.420
to have a graphical user interface

09:49.420 --> 09:52.160
on which you can then send your friends an email.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
Is that completely detached from the zeros and ones

09:58.480 --> 10:01.560
that are firing away inside the computer?

10:01.560 --> 10:02.880
It's not.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.800
Of course, when I talk about the user interface

10:04.800 --> 10:09.800
on your desktop, there's this whole sophisticated backstory

10:10.760 --> 10:13.120
to it, right, that the hardware and the software

10:13.120 --> 10:15.040
that's allowing that to happen.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.200
Evolution doesn't tell us the backstory, right?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.400
So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate

10:20.400 --> 10:23.040
to tell you what is that backstory.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.120
It's gonna say that whatever reality is,

10:27.120 --> 10:27.960
and that's the interesting thing,

10:27.960 --> 10:31.240
it says whatever reality is, you don't see it.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.280
You see a user interface, but it doesn't tell you

10:34.280 --> 10:38.800
what that user interface is, how it's built, right?

10:38.800 --> 10:43.800
Now we can try to look at certain aspects of the interface,

10:43.880 --> 10:46.040
but already we're gonna look at that and go,

10:46.040 --> 10:47.920
okay, before I would look at neurons

10:47.920 --> 10:49.600
and I was assuming that I was seeing something

10:49.600 --> 10:52.800
that was at least partially true,

10:52.800 --> 10:54.840
and now I'm realizing that it could be like looking

10:54.840 --> 10:59.220
at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop,

10:59.220 --> 11:02.560
and good luck going from that to the data structures

11:02.560 --> 11:05.320
and then the voltages, and I mean, good luck.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.940
There's just no way.

11:06.940 --> 11:08.560
So what's interesting about this is that

11:08.560 --> 11:12.960
our scientific theories are precise enough

11:12.960 --> 11:15.620
and rigorous enough to tell us certain limits,

11:16.620 --> 11:20.020
and even limits of the theories themselves,

11:20.020 --> 11:23.180
but they're not going to tell us what the next move is,

11:23.180 --> 11:25.860
and that's where scientific creativity comes in.

11:25.860 --> 11:28.940
So the stuff that I'm saying here, for example,

11:28.940 --> 11:31.000
is not alien to physicists.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.620
The physicists are saying precisely the same thing,

11:33.620 --> 11:35.220
that space-time is doomed.

11:35.220 --> 11:37.060
We've assumed that space-time is fundamental,

11:37.060 --> 11:39.340
that we've assumed that for several centuries,

11:39.340 --> 11:40.740
and it's been very useful.

11:40.740 --> 11:41.940
So all the things that you were mentioning,

11:41.940 --> 11:43.900
the particles and all the work that's been done,

11:43.900 --> 11:45.060
that's all been done in space-time,

11:45.060 --> 11:47.500
but now physicists are saying space-time is doomed.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.680
There's no such thing as space-time fundamentally

11:51.680 --> 11:54.020
in the laws of physics,

11:54.020 --> 11:58.540
and that comes actually out of gravity

11:58.540 --> 11:59.900
together with quantum field theory.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.540
It just comes right out of it.

12:01.540 --> 12:05.700
It's a theorem of those two theories put together,

12:05.700 --> 12:07.980
but it doesn't tell you what's behind it.

12:07.980 --> 12:11.820
So the physicists know that their best theories,

12:11.820 --> 12:14.620
Einstein's gravity and quantum field theory put together,

12:15.140 --> 12:17.420
entail that space-time cannot be fundamental,

12:17.420 --> 12:20.900
and therefore particles in space-time cannot be fundamental.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.540
They're just irreducible representations

12:22.540 --> 12:23.780
of the symmetries of space-time.

12:23.780 --> 12:24.780
That's what they are.

12:24.780 --> 12:27.620
So we put the two together.

12:27.620 --> 12:29.700
We put together what the physicists are discovering,

12:29.700 --> 12:32.020
and we can talk about how they do that,

12:32.020 --> 12:33.780
and then the new discoveries

12:33.780 --> 12:35.360
from evolution of a natural selection.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.740
Both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.

12:38.740 --> 12:42.360
And what both are saying is space-time has had a good ride.

12:43.480 --> 12:44.320
It's been very useful.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.520
Reductionism has been useful, but it's over,

12:46.520 --> 12:48.400
and it's time for us to go beyond.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.520
When you say space-time is doomed,

12:50.520 --> 12:53.200
is it the space, is it the time,

12:53.200 --> 12:57.660
is it the very hard-coded specification of four dimensions,

12:59.800 --> 13:01.560
or are you specifically referring

13:01.560 --> 13:05.160
to the kind of perceptual domain

13:05.160 --> 13:07.360
that humans operate in, which is space-time?

13:07.360 --> 13:09.620
You think like there's a 3D,

13:10.620 --> 13:13.160
like our world is three-dimensional,

13:13.160 --> 13:15.420
and time progresses forward,

13:15.420 --> 13:18.100
therefore three dimensions plus one, 4D.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.500
What exactly do you mean by space-time?

13:20.500 --> 13:24.040
What do you mean by space-time is doomed?

13:24.040 --> 13:24.880
Great, great.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.560
So this is, by the way, not my quote.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.840
This is from, for example, Nima Arkhani-Hamed

13:29.840 --> 13:31.720
at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton,

13:31.720 --> 13:34.300
Ed Whitten, also there,

13:34.300 --> 13:36.520
David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.320
So this is not just something that cognitive scientists,

13:39.320 --> 13:40.640
this is what the physicists are saying.

13:40.640 --> 13:45.120
Yeah, the physicists, they're space-time skeptics.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.600
Yeah, they're saying that,

13:46.600 --> 13:49.560
and I can say exactly why they think it's doomed,

13:49.560 --> 13:51.600
but what they're saying is that,

13:51.600 --> 13:53.840
because your question was what aspect of space-time,

13:53.840 --> 13:54.960
what are we talking about here?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.880
It's both space and time.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.720
They're union into space-time as an Einstein's theory.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.240
That's doomed.

14:01.240 --> 14:06.240
And they're basically saying that even quantum theory,

14:06.680 --> 14:09.200
this is Nima Arkhani-Hamed especially.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.880
So Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.520
So that the notion of Hilbert space,

14:15.520 --> 14:18.960
which is really critical to quantum field theory,

14:18.960 --> 14:20.960
quantum information theory,

14:20.960 --> 14:22.680
that's not going to figure in

14:22.680 --> 14:25.240
the fundamental new laws of physics.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.800
So what they're looking for

14:26.800 --> 14:31.800
is some new mathematical structures beyond space-time,

14:31.960 --> 14:35.240
beyond Einstein's four-dimensional space-time

14:35.240 --> 14:38.000
or supersymmetric version,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.120
geometric algebra signature, two comma four kind of,

14:41.120 --> 14:43.240
there are different ways that you can represent it,

14:43.240 --> 14:45.520
but they're finding new structures.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.280
And then by the way, they're succeeding now.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.600
They're finding, they found something called

14:48.600 --> 14:49.640
the amplitude hydron.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.480
This is Nima and his colleagues,

14:51.480 --> 14:53.560
the cosmological polytope.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.360
These are, so there are these like polytopes,

14:57.360 --> 15:00.280
these polyhedra in multi-dimensions,

15:00.280 --> 15:04.480
generalizations of simplices that are coding

15:04.480 --> 15:07.480
for, for example, the scattering amplitudes

15:07.480 --> 15:09.200
of processes in the Large Hadron Collider

15:09.200 --> 15:10.880
and other colliders.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.000
So they're finding that if they let go of space-time,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.920
completely, they're finding new ways

15:16.920 --> 15:18.720
of computing these scattering amplitudes

15:18.720 --> 15:22.560
that turn literally billions of terms into one term.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.000
When you do it in space and time,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.760
because it's the wrong framework,

15:26.760 --> 15:29.520
it's just a user interface from,

15:29.520 --> 15:30.880
that's not from the evolutionary point of view,

15:30.880 --> 15:32.120
it's just user interface.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.560
It's not a deep insight into the nature of reality.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.880
So it's missing deep symmetry,

15:36.880 --> 15:38.960
it's something called a dual conformal symmetry,

15:38.960 --> 15:40.880
which turns out to be true of the scattering data,

15:40.880 --> 15:42.680
but you can't see it in space-time.

15:42.680 --> 15:46.240
And it's making the computations way too complicated

15:46.240 --> 15:47.880
because you're trying to compute all the loops

15:47.880 --> 15:50.280
and Feynman diagrams and all the Feynman integrals.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.960
So see, the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes

15:52.960 --> 15:56.480
is trying to enforce two critical properties of space-time,

15:56.480 --> 15:58.560
locality and unitarity.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.400
And so by, when you enforce those,

16:00.400 --> 16:03.360
you get all these loops and multiple,

16:03.360 --> 16:04.560
different levels of loops.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.400
And for each of those,

16:05.400 --> 16:07.560
you have to add new terms to your computation.

16:07.560 --> 16:11.040
But when you do it outside of space-time,

16:11.040 --> 16:13.760
you don't have the notion of unitarity.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.720
You don't have the notion of locality.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.280
You have something deeper

16:17.280 --> 16:18.800
and it's capturing some symmetries

16:18.800 --> 16:20.760
that are actually true of the data.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.960
And, but then when you look at the geometry

16:22.960 --> 16:25.360
of the facets of these polytopes,

16:25.360 --> 16:29.520
then certain of them will code for unitarity

16:29.520 --> 16:30.760
and locality.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.360
So it actually comes out of the structure

16:32.360 --> 16:33.480
of these deep polytopes.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.480
So what we're finding is there's this whole new world.

16:36.480 --> 16:41.480
Now beyond space-time that is making explicit symmetries

16:42.080 --> 16:42.960
that are true of the data

16:42.960 --> 16:45.000
that cannot be seen in space-time.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.920
And that is turning the computations from billions of terms

16:47.920 --> 16:50.360
to one or two or a handful of terms.

16:50.360 --> 16:53.280
So we're getting insights into symmetries

16:53.280 --> 16:55.360
and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple

16:55.360 --> 16:56.840
because we're not doing something silly.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.000
We're not adding up all these loops in space-time.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.760
We're doing something far deeper,

17:00.760 --> 17:03.040
but they don't know what this world is about.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.840
So they're in an interesting position

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
where we know that space-time is doomed

17:09.000 --> 17:11.280
and I should probably tell you why it's doomed,

17:11.280 --> 17:13.200
what they're saying about why it's doomed,

17:13.200 --> 17:15.840
but they need a flashlight to look beyond space-time.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.320
What flashlight are we gonna use

17:17.320 --> 17:19.640
to look into the dark beyond space-time?

17:19.640 --> 17:22.200
Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory

17:22.200 --> 17:23.840
can't tell us what's beyond them.

17:23.840 --> 17:26.200
All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,

17:26.200 --> 17:30.040
space-time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,

17:30.040 --> 17:31.560
10 to the minus 43 seconds.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.960
Beyond that, space-time doesn't even make sense.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.040
It just has no operational definition.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.960
But it doesn't tell you what's beyond.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.520
And so they're just looking for deep structures

17:41.520 --> 17:43.640
like guessing is really fun.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.800
So these really brilliant guys,

17:45.800 --> 17:47.480
generic, brilliant men and women

17:47.480 --> 17:49.760
who are doing this work, physicists,

17:49.760 --> 17:53.120
are making guesses about these structures, informed guesses,

17:53.120 --> 17:54.080
because they're trying to ask,

17:54.080 --> 17:56.560
well, okay, what deeper structure could give us

17:56.560 --> 17:58.360
the stuff that we're seeing in space-time,

17:58.360 --> 17:59.960
but without certain commitments

17:59.960 --> 18:02.840
that we have to make in space-time, like locality.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.680
So they make these brilliant guesses.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.640
And of course, most of the time you're gonna be wrong,

18:06.640 --> 18:09.560
but once you get one or two that start to pay off,

18:09.560 --> 18:11.320
and then you get some lucky breaks.

18:11.320 --> 18:14.080
So they got a lucky break back in 1986.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.720
Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor

18:18.720 --> 18:22.120
took the scattering amplitude for two gluons

18:22.160 --> 18:24.240
coming in at high energy and four gluons

18:24.240 --> 18:25.600
going out at low energy.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.240
So that kind of scattering thing.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.320
So it's like apparently for people who are into this,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.080
that's sort of something that happens so often.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.360
You need to be able to find it and get rid of those

18:34.360 --> 18:36.200
because you already know about that and you need to.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.320
So you needed to compute them.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.920
It was billions of terms and they couldn't do it.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.000
Even for the supercomputers couldn't do that

18:42.000 --> 18:44.600
for the many billions or millions of times per second

18:44.600 --> 18:45.440
they needed to do it.

18:45.440 --> 18:48.840
So they begged, the experimentals begged the theorists

18:48.840 --> 18:51.320
and please, you got it.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.120
So Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,

18:53.120 --> 18:58.120
hundreds of pages and miraculously turned it into nine.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.360
And then a little bit later,

18:59.360 --> 19:01.200
they guessed one term expression

19:01.200 --> 19:02.480
that turned out to be equivalent.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.240
So billions of terms reduced to one term,

19:07.240 --> 19:10.720
that so-called famous Park-Taylor formula, 1986.

19:10.720 --> 19:14.240
And that was like, okay, where did that come from?

19:14.240 --> 19:18.840
This is a pointer into a deep realm beyond space and time,

19:19.040 --> 19:21.440
but no one, I mean, what can you do with it?

19:21.440 --> 19:23.120
And they thought maybe it was a one-off,

19:23.120 --> 19:25.680
but then other formulas started coming up.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.440
And then eventually Neymar, Kani Hamad and his team

19:28.440 --> 19:30.200
found this thing called the Amplituhedron,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.640
which really sort of captures the whole,

19:32.640 --> 19:34.600
a big part of the whole ball of wax.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.840
I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.480
So I won't say they did it all by any means.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.680
They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.920
So what's remarkable to me

19:44.920 --> 19:49.800
is that two pillars of modern science,

19:49.800 --> 19:52.880
quantum field theory with gravity on the one hand,

19:52.880 --> 19:55.520
and evolution by natural selection on the other.

19:55.520 --> 19:59.080
Just in the last 20 years have very clearly said,

19:59.080 --> 20:01.120
space-time has had a good run.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.840
Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.720
So we had a great ontology of space-time,

20:05.720 --> 20:07.960
a great methodology of reductionism.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.480
Now it's time for a new trick.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.040
But now you need to go deeper and show,

20:13.240 --> 20:14.960
by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away

20:14.960 --> 20:17.200
everything we've done, not by a long shot.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.760
Every new idea that we come up with beyond space-time

20:20.760 --> 20:23.320
must project precisely into space-time

20:23.320 --> 20:25.320
and it better give us back everything that we know

20:25.320 --> 20:28.720
and love in space-time or generalizations,

20:28.720 --> 20:31.400
or it's not gonna be taken seriously and it shouldn't be.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.480
So we have a strong constraint

20:33.480 --> 20:35.480
on whatever we're going to do beyond space-time.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.600
It needs to project into space-time.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.400
And whatever this deeper theory is,

20:39.400 --> 20:42.840
it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.440
This may not be part of this deeper realm.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.480
But when we take whatever that thing is beyond space-time

20:47.480 --> 20:49.200
and project it into space-time,

20:49.200 --> 20:51.760
it has to look like evolution by natural selection

20:51.760 --> 20:52.600
or it's wrong.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.400
So that's a strong constraint on this work.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.880
So even the evolution by natural selection

21:00.880 --> 21:05.880
and quantum field theory could be interfaces

21:06.440 --> 21:11.440
into something that doesn't look anything like,

21:11.760 --> 21:13.720
like you mentioned, I mean, it's interesting to think

21:13.720 --> 21:16.880
that evolution might be a very crappy interface

21:16.880 --> 21:18.360
into something much deeper.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.200
That's right.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.880
They're both telling us that the framework that you've had

21:21.880 --> 21:24.160
can only go so far and it has to stop

21:24.160 --> 21:25.560
and there's something beyond.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.080
And that framework, the very framework

21:27.080 --> 21:29.200
that is space and time itself.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.400
Now, of course, evolution by natural selection

21:32.400 --> 21:35.440
is not telling us about like Einstein's

21:35.440 --> 21:36.320
relativistic space-time.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.320
So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.

21:38.320 --> 21:42.400
It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time,

21:42.400 --> 21:46.200
which we have used as the basis for creating

21:46.200 --> 21:49.720
first a Newtonian space versus time

21:49.720 --> 21:53.320
as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.680
And then Einstein then took that and extended even further.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.120
So the relationship between what evolution is telling us

21:59.120 --> 22:01.040
and what the physicists are telling us is that

22:01.040 --> 22:05.880
in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space-time

22:06.800 --> 22:11.320
are formulated as sort of rigorous extensions

22:11.320 --> 22:15.520
of our perceptual space, making it mathematically rigorous

22:15.520 --> 22:19.080
and laying out the symmetries that they find there.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.760
So that's sort of the relationship between them.

22:20.760 --> 22:23.040
So it's the perceptual space-time that evolution

22:23.040 --> 22:27.760
is telling us is just a user interface effectively.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.960
And then the physicists are finding

22:28.960 --> 22:31.440
that even the mathematical extension of that

22:31.440 --> 22:34.200
into the Einsteinian formulation

22:34.280 --> 22:37.000
has to be as well, not the final story.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.120
There's something deeper.

22:38.120 --> 22:43.120
So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces

22:43.200 --> 22:45.880
as we march forward from Newtonian physics

22:47.960 --> 22:49.920
to quantum mechanics.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.800
These are all, in your view, interfaces.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.240
Are we getting closer to objective reality?

22:59.240 --> 23:02.280
How do we know if these interfaces

23:02.320 --> 23:04.880
in the process of science,

23:04.880 --> 23:06.920
the reason we like those interfaces

23:06.920 --> 23:09.720
is because they're predictive of some aspects,

23:09.720 --> 23:13.200
strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.080
Is that completely deviating

23:16.080 --> 23:19.600
from our understanding of that reality

23:19.600 --> 23:22.800
or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.600
Well, of course, one critical constraint

23:24.600 --> 23:27.240
on all of our theories is that they are empirically tested

23:27.240 --> 23:30.800
and pass the experiments that we have for them.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.440
So no one's arguing against experiments being important

23:34.440 --> 23:38.440
and wanting to test all of our current theories

23:38.440 --> 23:40.600
and any new theories on that.

23:40.600 --> 23:44.280
So that's all there.

23:44.280 --> 23:48.040
But we have good reason to believe

23:48.920 --> 23:51.440
that science will never get a theory of everything.

23:52.360 --> 23:53.600
Everything, everything.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.520
Everything, everything, right.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.400
The final theory of everything, right.

23:56.400 --> 23:59.120
I think that my own take is, for what it's worth,

23:59.120 --> 24:01.600
is that Gödel's incompleteness theorem

24:01.600 --> 24:03.120
sort of points us in that direction,

24:03.120 --> 24:04.800
that even with mathematics,

24:05.920 --> 24:09.400
any finite axiomatization that's sophisticated enough

24:09.400 --> 24:11.000
to be able to do arithmetic,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.200
it's easy to show that there'll be statements that are true

24:14.200 --> 24:16.920
that can't be proven,

24:16.920 --> 24:19.480
can't be deduced from within that framework.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.920
And if you add the new statements to your axioms,

24:21.920 --> 24:24.240
then there'll be always new statements that are true

24:24.240 --> 24:26.920
but can't be proven with a new axiom system.

24:26.960 --> 24:31.960
And the best scientific theories in physics, for example,

24:32.640 --> 24:35.120
and also now evolution, are mathematical.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.320
So our theories are gonna be,

24:36.320 --> 24:38.440
they're gonna have their own assumptions

24:38.440 --> 24:41.760
and they'll be mathematically precise.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.280
And there'll be theories perhaps of everything

24:43.280 --> 24:44.440
except those assumptions,

24:44.440 --> 24:46.320
because the assumptions are,

24:46.320 --> 24:48.320
we say, please grant me these assumptions.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.480
If you grant me these assumptions,

24:49.480 --> 24:51.520
then I can explain this other stuff.

24:51.520 --> 24:56.520
But so you have the assumptions that are like,

24:57.040 --> 24:58.640
miracles, as far as the theory is concerned,

24:58.640 --> 24:59.480
they're not explained.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.560
They're the starting points for explanation.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.200
And then you have the mathematical structure

25:03.200 --> 25:04.240
of the theory itself,

25:04.240 --> 25:07.560
which will have the girdle limits.

25:07.560 --> 25:12.560
And so my take is that reality,

25:12.960 --> 25:16.600
whatever it is, is always going to transcend

25:18.240 --> 25:22.440
any conceptual theory that we didn't come up with.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.640
There's always gonna be mystery at the edges.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.400
Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.240
Okay.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.880
And truths.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.840
So there's this idea that is brought up

25:34.840 --> 25:39.440
in the financial space of settlement of transactions.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.560
It's often talked about in cryptocurrency especially.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.600
So you could do, money, cash,

25:44.600 --> 25:48.640
is not connected to anything.

25:48.640 --> 25:52.200
It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,

25:52.200 --> 25:57.200
but then you can use money to exchange value, to transact.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.760
So when it was on the gold standard,

25:59.760 --> 26:04.760
the money would represent some stable component of reality.

26:05.240 --> 26:10.240
Isn't it more effective to avoid things

26:10.240 --> 26:14.160
like hyperinflation, if we generalize that idea?

26:14.160 --> 26:19.120
Isn't it better to connect your,

26:19.120 --> 26:20.520
whatever we humans are doing

26:20.520 --> 26:23.040
in the social interaction space with each other?

26:23.040 --> 26:26.000
Isn't it better, from an evolutionary perspective,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.040
to connect it to some degree to reality

26:28.040 --> 26:31.640
so that the transactions are settled

26:31.640 --> 26:33.720
with something that's universal,

26:33.720 --> 26:35.880
as opposed to us constantly operating

26:35.880 --> 26:38.080
in something that's a complete illusion?

26:38.080 --> 26:40.480
Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that?

26:40.480 --> 26:45.480
Like where you really deviate very, very far away

26:46.000 --> 26:51.000
from the underlying reality,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.720
or do you never get in trouble for this?

26:53.720 --> 26:58.200
Can you just completely drift far, far away

26:58.200 --> 27:01.560
from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?

27:01.560 --> 27:02.840
That's a great question.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.240
On the financial side, there's two levels,

27:05.240 --> 27:06.920
at least, that we could take your question.

27:06.920 --> 27:11.680
One is strictly evolutionary psychology of financial systems.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.520
And that's pretty interesting.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.120
And there the decentralized idea

27:15.120 --> 27:18.560
that the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies

27:18.560 --> 27:19.960
may make good sense

27:19.960 --> 27:22.440
from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.760
Having human nature being what it is,

27:25.760 --> 27:30.640
putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers

27:30.640 --> 27:34.280
depends a lot on the veracity of those

27:34.280 --> 27:37.080
and trustworthiness of those few central controllers.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.440
And we have ample evidence time and again

27:39.440 --> 27:41.880
that that's often betrayed.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.920
So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say,

27:45.600 --> 27:46.720
to have a decentralized...

27:46.720 --> 27:49.600
I mean, democracy is a step in that direction, right?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.240
We don't have a monarch now telling us what to do.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.560
We decentralize things, right?

27:54.560 --> 27:57.840
Because if you have Marcus Aurelius as your emperor,

27:57.840 --> 27:58.680
you're great.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.160
If you have Nero, it's not so great.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.320
And so we don't want that.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.280
So democracy is a step in that direction.

28:04.280 --> 28:08.800
But I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step

28:08.800 --> 28:13.120
and is going to even make the democratization even greater.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.840
So that's one level of...

28:14.840 --> 28:16.480
Also, the fact that power corrupts

28:16.480 --> 28:18.120
and absolute power corrupts absolutely

28:18.120 --> 28:22.600
is also a consequence of evolution.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.960
That's also a feature, I think, right?

28:26.960 --> 28:30.840
You can argue from the long span of living organisms,

28:30.840 --> 28:33.800
it's nice for power to corrupt for you to...

28:33.800 --> 28:38.760
So mad men and women throughout history

28:38.760 --> 28:43.000
might be useful to teach us a lesson.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.720
We can learn from our negative example, right?

28:44.720 --> 28:45.560
Exactly.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.200
Right, right.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.040
Right, so power does corrupt

28:49.040 --> 28:51.280
and I think that you can think about that again

28:51.280 --> 28:53.560
from an evolutionary point of view.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.800
But I think that your question was a little deeper

28:55.800 --> 29:00.800
when that was, does the evolutionary interface idea

29:01.480 --> 29:03.080
sort of unhinge science

29:03.080 --> 29:08.080
from some kind of important test for the theories, right?

29:08.800 --> 29:10.360
We don't want...

29:10.360 --> 29:13.160
Doesn't mean that anything goes in scientific theory,

29:13.160 --> 29:15.880
but if we don't see the truth,

29:15.880 --> 29:18.640
is there no way to tether our theories and test them?

29:18.640 --> 29:23.640
And I think there's no problem there.

29:24.920 --> 29:27.800
We can only test things in terms of what we can measure

29:27.800 --> 29:29.520
with our senses in space and time.

29:29.520 --> 29:33.720
So we're going to have to continue to do experiments,

29:33.720 --> 29:36.840
but we're gonna understand a little bit differently

29:36.840 --> 29:38.440
what those experiments are.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.840
We had thought that when we see a pointer

29:41.840 --> 29:45.720
on some machine in an experiment,

29:45.720 --> 29:48.240
that the machine exists, the pointer exists

29:48.240 --> 29:51.280
and the values exist even when no one is looking at them

29:51.280 --> 29:52.760
and that they're an objective truth.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.440
And our best theories are telling us no.

29:55.440 --> 29:58.440
The pointers are just pointers

29:58.440 --> 30:00.080
and that's what you have to rely on

30:00.080 --> 30:02.840
for making your judgments.

30:02.840 --> 30:07.600
But even the pointers themselves

30:07.600 --> 30:10.440
are not the objective reality.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.560
So, and I think Gödel is telling us that,

30:13.560 --> 30:15.720
not that anything goes,

30:15.720 --> 30:18.760
but as you develop new axiom systems,

30:18.760 --> 30:21.600
you will find out what goes within that axiom system

30:21.600 --> 30:23.680
and what testable predictions you can make.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.760
So I don't think we're untethered.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.960
We continue to do experiments.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.120
What I think we won't have that we want

30:31.120 --> 30:34.000
is a conceptual understanding

30:34.000 --> 30:35.520
that gives us a theory of everything

30:35.520 --> 30:37.520
that's final and complete.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.240
I think that this is, to put it another way,

30:40.240 --> 30:43.040
this is job security for scientists.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.200
Our job will never be done.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.720
It's job security for neuroscience

30:47.720 --> 30:50.720
because before we thought that when we looked in the brain,

30:50.720 --> 30:52.400
we saw neurons and neural networks

30:52.400 --> 30:57.400
and action potentials and synapses and so forth.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.960
And that was it.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.320
That was the reality.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.760
Now we have to reverse engineer that.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.760
We have to say, what is beyond space-time?

31:04.760 --> 31:05.760
What is going on?

31:05.760 --> 31:08.400
What is a dynamical system beyond space-time

31:08.400 --> 31:10.520
that when we project it into Einstein's space-time

31:10.520 --> 31:12.360
gives us things that look like neurons

31:12.360 --> 31:14.200
and neural networks and synapses.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.480
So we have to reverse engineer.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.000
So there's gonna be lots more work for neuroscience.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.880
It's gonna be far more complicated

31:20.880 --> 31:23.840
and difficult and challenging,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.160
but that's wonderful.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.040
That's what we need to do.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.400
We thought neurons exist when they aren't perceived

31:28.400 --> 31:29.320
and they don't.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.040
In the same way that if I show you,

31:31.040 --> 31:32.000
when I say they don't exist,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.440
I should be very, very concrete.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.280
If I draw on a piece of paper,

31:36.280 --> 31:40.480
a little sketch of something that is called the Necker cube.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.840
It's just a little line drawing of a cube, right?

31:42.840 --> 31:44.000
It's on a flat piece of paper.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.120
If I execute it well and I show it to you,

31:46.120 --> 31:48.360
you'll see a 3D cube and you'll see it flip.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.760
Sometimes you'll see one face in front.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.920
Sometimes you'll see the other face in front.

31:51.920 --> 31:53.240
But if I ask you, you know,

31:53.240 --> 31:55.360
which face is in front when you don't look?

31:57.240 --> 31:59.600
The answer is, well, neither face is in front

31:59.600 --> 32:01.320
because there's no cube.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.240
This is a flat piece of paper.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.120
So when you look at the piece of paper,

32:05.120 --> 32:08.440
you perceptually create the cube.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.960
And when you look at it,

32:09.960 --> 32:12.120
then you fix one face to be in front

32:12.120 --> 32:13.120
and one face to be in.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.000
So that's what I mean when I say it doesn't exist.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.120
Spacetime itself is like the cube.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.960
It's a data structure that your sensory systems construct,

32:21.960 --> 32:23.720
whatever your sensory systems mean now,

32:23.720 --> 32:27.320
because we now have to even take that for granted.

32:27.320 --> 32:31.400
But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly

32:31.400 --> 32:33.200
and they're data structures

32:34.200 --> 32:35.680
and you garbage collect them when you don't need them.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.480
So you create them and garbage collect them.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.880
But is it possible that it's mapped well

32:40.880 --> 32:45.640
in some concrete predictable way to objective reality?

32:45.640 --> 32:48.640
The sheet of paper, this two dimensional space,

32:48.640 --> 32:51.240
or we can talk about spacetime,

32:51.240 --> 32:55.840
maps in some way that we maybe don't yet understand,

32:55.840 --> 32:59.640
but we'll one day understand what that mapping is,

32:59.640 --> 33:00.920
but it maps reliably.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.920
It is tethered in that way.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.880
Well, yes, and so the new theories

33:04.880 --> 33:07.040
that the physicists are finding beyond spacetime

33:07.040 --> 33:08.120
have that kind of tethering.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.920
So they show precisely how you start with an amplitude hydron

33:11.920 --> 33:15.280
and how you project this high dimensional structure

33:15.280 --> 33:18.280
into the four dimensions of spacetime.

33:18.280 --> 33:22.320
So there's a precise procedure that relates the two.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.840
And they're doing the same thing

33:23.840 --> 33:25.160
with the cosmological polytopes.

33:25.160 --> 33:29.760
So they're the ones that are making the most concrete

33:29.760 --> 33:32.840
and fun advances going beyond spacetime.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.920
And there they're tethering it.

33:34.920 --> 33:38.400
But they say this is precisely the mathematical projection

33:38.400 --> 33:41.560
from this deeper structure into spacetime.

33:41.560 --> 33:44.600
One thing I'll say about as a non-physicist

33:44.600 --> 33:46.600
what I find interesting is that they're finding

33:46.600 --> 33:51.080
just geometry, but there's no notion of dynamics.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.920
Right now they're just finding

33:52.920 --> 33:57.360
these static geometric structures, which is impressive.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.400
So I'm not putting them down.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.120
This is what they're doing is unbelievably complicated

34:01.320 --> 34:05.800
and brilliant and adventurous.

34:07.440 --> 34:08.280
It's all those things.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.720
And beautiful from a human aesthetic perspective

34:11.720 --> 34:13.320
because geometry is beautiful.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.160
Absolutely.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.400
And they're finding symmetries that are true of the data

34:16.400 --> 34:18.680
that can't be seen in spacetime.

34:18.680 --> 34:22.960
But I'm looking for a theory beyond spacetime

34:22.960 --> 34:24.440
that's a dynamical theory.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.520
I would love to find, and we can talk about that

34:27.520 --> 34:29.560
at some point, a theory of consciousness

34:29.560 --> 34:33.120
in which the dynamics of consciousness itself

34:33.120 --> 34:35.480
will give rise to the geometry

34:35.480 --> 34:37.960
that the physicists are finding beyond spacetime.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.440
If we can do that, then we'd have a completely different way

34:40.440 --> 34:42.640
of looking at how consciousness is related

34:42.640 --> 34:45.280
to what we call the brain or the physical world

34:45.280 --> 34:46.280
more generally, right?

34:46.280 --> 34:49.640
Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues,

34:49.640 --> 34:51.920
99% of them are trying to,

34:53.880 --> 34:56.720
they're assuming spacetime is fundamental.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.160
They're assuming that particles are fundamental,

34:59.160 --> 35:02.000
quarks, gluons, leptons, and so forth.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.040
Elements, atoms, and so forth are fundamental

35:04.040 --> 35:06.400
and that therefore neurons and brains

35:06.400 --> 35:08.800
are part of objective reality.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.880
And that somehow when you get matter

35:10.880 --> 35:12.640
that's complicated enough,

35:12.640 --> 35:16.240
it will somehow generate conscious experiences

35:16.240 --> 35:17.840
by its functional properties.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.400
Or if you're panpsychist,

35:19.400 --> 35:22.680
maybe in addition to the physical properties of particles,

35:22.680 --> 35:27.240
you add consciousness property as well.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.560
And then you combine these physical

35:29.560 --> 35:32.200
and conscious properties to get more complicated ones.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.720
But they're all doing it within spacetime.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.960
All of the work that's being done on consciousness

35:38.960 --> 35:41.880
and its relationship to the brain

35:41.880 --> 35:45.000
is all assumed something that our best theories

35:45.000 --> 35:46.800
are telling us is doomed, spacetime.

35:46.800 --> 35:50.440
Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?

35:50.440 --> 35:52.080
So you bring up spacetime.

35:53.080 --> 35:56.960
I mean, that's just one useful interface

35:56.960 --> 35:58.720
we've used for a long time.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.720
Surely there's other interfaces.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.720
Is spacetime just one of the big ones

36:04.720 --> 36:06.800
to build up people's intuition

36:06.800 --> 36:08.520
about the fact that they do assume

36:08.520 --> 36:10.360
a lot of things strongly?

36:10.360 --> 36:15.040
Or is it in fact a fundamental flaw

36:15.040 --> 36:16.560
in the way we see the world?

36:17.480 --> 36:20.640
Well, everything else that we think we know

36:20.640 --> 36:21.840
are things in spacetime.

36:23.360 --> 36:24.200
Sure.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.720
And so when you say spacetime is doomed,

36:27.720 --> 36:32.720
this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,

36:32.880 --> 36:35.880
the whole conceptual framework that we've had in science.

36:35.880 --> 36:37.720
Not to the scientific method,

36:37.720 --> 36:40.800
but to the fundamental ontology

36:40.800 --> 36:42.400
and also the fundamental methodology,

36:42.400 --> 36:45.640
the ontology of spacetime and its contents,

36:45.640 --> 36:47.360
and the methodology of reductionism,

36:47.360 --> 36:51.960
which is that as we go to smaller scales in spacetime,

36:51.960 --> 36:55.160
we will find more and more fundamental laws.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.440
And that's been very useful for space and time

36:58.440 --> 37:01.440
for centuries, reductionism for centuries.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.720
But now we realize that that's over.

37:04.720 --> 37:08.720
Reductionism is in fact dead, as is spacetime.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.600
What exactly is reductionism?

37:10.600 --> 37:13.120
What is the process of reductionism

37:13.120 --> 37:17.640
that is different than some of the physicists

37:17.640 --> 37:19.440
that you mentioned that are trying to think,

37:19.440 --> 37:22.080
trying to let go of the assumption of spacetime?

37:22.080 --> 37:24.560
Looking beyond, isn't that still trying to come up

37:24.560 --> 37:27.360
with a simple model that explains this whole thing?

37:27.360 --> 37:29.400
Isn't it still reducing?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.480
It's a wonderful question because it really helps

37:31.480 --> 37:33.120
to clarify two different notions,

37:33.120 --> 37:35.480
which is scientific explanation on the one hand

37:36.520 --> 37:39.360
and a particular kind of scientific explanation

37:39.360 --> 37:40.840
on the other, which is the reductionist.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.240
So the reductionist explanation is saying,

37:43.240 --> 37:47.520
I will start with things that are smaller in spacetime

37:47.520 --> 37:49.320
and therefore more fundamental,

37:49.320 --> 37:51.080
where the laws are more fundamental.

37:51.080 --> 37:54.880
So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.000
Whereas in science more generally,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.680
we just say like when Einstein did

37:59.680 --> 38:01.480
the special theory of relativity,

38:01.480 --> 38:03.600
he's saying, let me have a couple postulates.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.160
I will assume that the speed of light is universal

38:06.160 --> 38:11.160
for all observers in uniform motion

38:12.000 --> 38:13.360
and that the laws of physics,

38:13.360 --> 38:16.760
so if you're for uniform motion are those.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.080
That's not a reductionist.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.000
Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.360
I can build this entire concept of spacetime out of it.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.560
It's not a reductionist thing.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.760
You're not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.600
You're coming up with these deep, deep principles.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.080
Same thing with this theory of gravity, right?

38:33.080 --> 38:35.600
It's the falling elevator idea, right?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.680
So this is not a reductionist kind of thing.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.760
It's something different.

38:39.760 --> 38:44.760
So simplification is a bigger thing than just reductionism.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.720
Reductionism has been a particularly useful

38:47.720 --> 38:49.520
kind of scientific explanation,

38:49.520 --> 38:51.680
for example, in thermodynamics, right?

38:51.680 --> 38:53.360
Where the notion that we have of heat,

38:53.360 --> 38:56.640
some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.560
It turns out that Neale Boltzmann and others discovered,

38:59.560 --> 39:01.960
well, hey, if we go to smaller and smaller scales,

39:01.960 --> 39:04.440
we find these things called molecules or atoms.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.440
And if we think of them as bouncing around

39:06.440 --> 39:08.680
and having some kind of energy,

39:08.680 --> 39:13.680
then what we call heat really can be reduced to that.

39:14.720 --> 39:19.080
And so that's a particularly useful kind of reduction,

39:19.080 --> 39:21.400
is a useful kind of scientific explanation

39:21.400 --> 39:25.480
that works within a range of scales within spacetime.

39:25.480 --> 39:28.480
But we know now precisely where that has to stop,

39:28.480 --> 39:30.280
10 to the minus 33 centimeters

39:30.280 --> 39:32.760
and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.400
And I would be impressed

39:35.320 --> 39:37.520
if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.520
I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.

39:43.560 --> 39:44.880
I don't even know how to comprehend

39:44.880 --> 39:47.360
either of those numbers, frankly.

39:47.360 --> 39:51.520
Just a small aside, because I am a computer science person,

39:51.520 --> 39:54.160
I also find cellular automata beautiful.

39:54.160 --> 39:57.840
And so you have somebody like Steven Wolfram,

39:57.840 --> 40:01.640
who recently has been very excitedly exploring

40:02.360 --> 40:04.320
a proposal for a data structure

40:04.320 --> 40:07.600
that could be the numbers that would make you

40:07.600 --> 40:09.240
a little bit happier in terms of scale,

40:09.240 --> 40:11.720
because they're very, very, very, very tiny.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.480
Do you like this space of exploration

40:15.480 --> 40:18.600
of really thinking, letting go of spacetime,

40:18.600 --> 40:20.320
letting go of everything, and trying to think

40:20.320 --> 40:21.680
what kind of data structures

40:21.680 --> 40:23.800
could be underneath this whole mess?

40:23.800 --> 40:24.640
That's right.

40:24.640 --> 40:27.800
So if they're thinking about these as outside of spacetime,

40:27.800 --> 40:29.120
then that's what we have to do.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.560
That's what our best theories are telling us.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.600
You now have to think outside of spacetime.

40:32.600 --> 40:36.520
Now, of course, I should back up and say,

40:36.520 --> 40:40.360
we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?

40:40.360 --> 40:41.960
But that doesn't mean that there's not good work

40:41.960 --> 40:42.960
to do on Newton.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.280
There's all sorts of Newtonian physics

40:44.280 --> 40:46.240
that takes us to the moon and so forth,

40:46.240 --> 40:47.240
and there's lots of good problems

40:47.240 --> 40:49.960
that we want to solve with Newtonian physics.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.160
The same thing will be true of spacetime.

40:52.160 --> 40:53.960
It's not like we're gonna stop using spacetime.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.400
We'll continue to do all sorts of good work there.

40:56.400 --> 40:59.720
But for those scientists who are really looking

40:59.720 --> 41:04.240
to go deeper, to actually find the next,

41:04.240 --> 41:06.160
just like what Einstein did to Newton,

41:06.160 --> 41:07.440
what are we gonna do to Einstein?

41:07.440 --> 41:09.800
How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory

41:09.800 --> 41:10.920
to something deeper?

41:10.920 --> 41:13.280
Then we have to actually let go.

41:13.280 --> 41:17.800
And if we're gonna do like this automata kind of approach,

41:18.800 --> 41:21.200
it's critical that it's not automata in spacetime.

41:21.200 --> 41:23.600
It's automata prior to spacetime,

41:23.600 --> 41:25.880
from which we're going to show how spacetime emerges.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.200
If you're doing automata within spacetime,

41:28.200 --> 41:29.600
well, that might be a fun model,

41:30.440 --> 41:32.440
but it's not the radical new step that we need.

41:33.480 --> 41:36.720
Yeah, so the spacetime emerges from that, whatever system.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.560
Like you're saying, it's a dynamical system.

41:39.560 --> 41:42.480
Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means

41:42.480 --> 41:43.720
when we go beyond?

41:45.480 --> 41:48.040
When you start to think about dynamics,

41:48.040 --> 41:50.320
it could mean a lot of things.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.960
Even causality could mean a lot of things

41:52.960 --> 41:56.640
if we realize that everything's in an interface.

41:57.080 --> 42:00.440
Like what, how much do we really know

42:00.440 --> 42:01.440
is an interesting question.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.560
Because you brought up neurons,

42:02.560 --> 42:05.480
I gotta ask you yet another tangent.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.800
There's a paper I remember a while ago looking at called,

42:08.800 --> 42:11.520
could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?

42:11.520 --> 42:14.200
And I just enjoyed that thought experiment

42:14.200 --> 42:16.800
that they provided, which is they basically,

42:16.800 --> 42:19.880
it's a couple of neuroscientists, Eric Jonas

42:19.880 --> 42:24.880
and Conrad Kording, who use the tools of neuroscience

42:24.880 --> 42:29.880
to analyze a microprocessor, so a computer, computer chip.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.240
Yeah, if we lesion it here, what happens and so forth.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.560
And if you go and lesion into a computer,

42:35.400 --> 42:37.880
it's very, very clear that lesion experiments

42:37.880 --> 42:39.040
on computers are not gonna give you

42:39.040 --> 42:40.440
a lot of insight into how it works.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.680
And also the measurement devices and the kind of sort of,

42:42.680 --> 42:44.600
just using the basic approaches of neuroscience,

42:44.600 --> 42:47.160
collecting the data, trying to intuit

42:47.160 --> 42:49.440
about the underlying function of it.

42:49.440 --> 42:51.160
And that helps you understand

42:51.160 --> 42:55.920
that our scientific exploration of concepts,

42:57.760 --> 43:02.480
depending on the field, are maybe

43:02.480 --> 43:05.040
in the very, very early stages.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.520
I wouldn't say it leaves us astray.

43:08.520 --> 43:13.000
Perhaps it does sometimes, but it's not anywhere close

43:13.000 --> 43:14.720
to some fundamental mechanism

43:14.720 --> 43:16.480
that actually makes the thing work.

43:16.480 --> 43:19.000
I don't know if you can sort of comment on that

43:19.000 --> 43:20.480
in terms of using neuroscience

43:20.480 --> 43:24.240
to understand the human mind and neurons.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.360
Are we really far away potentially

43:26.360 --> 43:29.560
from understanding in the way we understand

43:30.520 --> 43:33.760
the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?

43:33.760 --> 43:38.000
So one thing about understanding

43:38.000 --> 43:39.600
is you can understand for fun.

43:40.640 --> 43:45.640
The other one is to understand so you could build things.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.200
And that's when you really have to understand.

43:49.120 --> 43:49.960
Exactly.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.880
In fact, what got me into the field at MIT

43:53.880 --> 43:57.640
was work by David Marr on this very topic.

43:57.640 --> 43:59.840
So David Marr was a professor at MIT,

43:59.840 --> 44:02.040
but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience,

44:02.040 --> 44:05.320
studying just the architectures of the brain.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.640
But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.

44:10.040 --> 44:15.040
He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was,

44:15.160 --> 44:17.160
left him unsatisfied because he didn't know

44:17.160 --> 44:19.520
what the cerebellum was for

44:19.520 --> 44:21.760
and why it had that architecture.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.560
And so he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there.

44:25.560 --> 44:29.680
And he said he had this three-level approach

44:29.680 --> 44:30.760
that really grabbed my attention.

44:30.760 --> 44:32.760
So when I was an undergrad at UCLA,

44:32.760 --> 44:34.840
I read one of his papers in a class and said,

44:34.840 --> 44:35.680
who is this guy?

44:35.680 --> 44:37.520
Because he said, you have to have a computational theory.

44:37.520 --> 44:39.080
What is being computed and why?

44:40.400 --> 44:42.480
An algorithm, how is it being computed?

44:42.480 --> 44:44.800
What are the prosaic algorithms?

44:44.800 --> 44:45.920
And then the hardware,

44:45.920 --> 44:47.800
how does it get instantiated in the hardware?

44:47.800 --> 44:50.360
And so to really do neuroscience, he argued,

44:50.360 --> 44:52.760
we needed to have understanding at all those levels.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.360
And that really got me.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.360
I loved the neuroscience, but I realized

44:56.360 --> 44:58.480
this guy was saying, if you can't build it,

44:58.480 --> 45:00.040
you don't understand it effectively.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.960
And so that's why I went to MIT.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.480
And I had the pleasure of working with David

45:04.480 --> 45:07.720
until he died just a year and a half later.

45:09.160 --> 45:12.720
So there's been that idea that with neuroscience,

45:12.760 --> 45:15.880
we have to have, in some sense, a top-down model

45:15.880 --> 45:18.920
of what's being computed and why

45:18.920 --> 45:20.000
that we would then go after.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.480
And the same thing with the,

45:21.480 --> 45:24.200
trying to reverse engineer a computing system

45:24.200 --> 45:25.480
like your laptop.

45:25.480 --> 45:27.600
We really need to understand

45:27.600 --> 45:29.080
what the user interface is about

45:29.080 --> 45:34.080
and what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.

45:34.200 --> 45:37.440
You need to know why to really understand

45:37.440 --> 45:40.320
all the circuitry and what it's for.

45:40.320 --> 45:45.320
Now, we don't, evolution of a natural selection

45:46.560 --> 45:51.560
does not tell us the deeper question that we're asking,

45:51.760 --> 45:53.880
the answer to the deeper question, which is why?

45:55.880 --> 45:59.600
What's this deeper reality and what's it up to and why?

45:59.600 --> 46:03.200
All it tells us is that whatever reality is,

46:04.120 --> 46:05.480
it's not what you see.

46:06.440 --> 46:11.440
What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

46:12.160 --> 46:15.400
So just to linger on this fascinating, bold question

46:15.400 --> 46:19.000
that shakes you out of your dream state.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.400
Does this fiction still help you in building intuitions

46:23.400 --> 46:27.800
as literary fiction does about reality?

46:27.800 --> 46:30.240
The reason we read literary fiction

46:31.240 --> 46:34.760
is it helps us build intuitions

46:34.760 --> 46:37.160
in an understanding in indirect way,

46:37.160 --> 46:40.320
sneak up to the difficult questions of human nature.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.920
Great fiction.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.440
Same with this observed reality.

46:46.120 --> 46:48.000
Does this interface that we get,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.720
this fictional interface help us build intuition

46:50.720 --> 46:55.040
about deeper truths of how this whole mess works?

46:55.040 --> 46:58.880
Well, I think that each theory that we propose

46:58.880 --> 47:01.120
will give its own answer to that question, right?

47:01.120 --> 47:05.280
So when the physicists are proposing these structures

47:05.280 --> 47:08.240
like the amplituhedron and cosmological polytope,

47:08.240 --> 47:11.120
associahedron and so forth, beyond space time,

47:11.120 --> 47:14.200
we can then ask your question for those specific structures

47:14.200 --> 47:17.640
and say, how much information, for example,

47:17.640 --> 47:19.240
does evolution of a natural selection

47:19.240 --> 47:24.240
and the kinds of sensory systems that we have right now

47:24.520 --> 47:26.920
give us about this deeper reality?

47:26.920 --> 47:30.000
And why did we evolve this way?

47:30.000 --> 47:33.040
We can try to answer that question from within the deep.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.920
So there's not gonna be a general answer.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.760
I think we're gonna, what we'll have to do

47:36.760 --> 47:39.320
is posit these new deeper theories

47:39.320 --> 47:41.480
and then try to answer your question

47:41.480 --> 47:43.600
within the framework of those deeper theories,

47:43.600 --> 47:47.160
knowing full well that there'll be an even deeper theory.

47:47.160 --> 47:49.840
So is this paralyzing though?

47:49.840 --> 47:53.360
Because how do we know we're not completely adrift

47:54.360 --> 47:57.720
out to sea, lost forever from,

47:57.720 --> 48:00.080
so like that our theories are completely lost.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.960
So if it's all,

48:04.240 --> 48:07.920
if we can never truly deeply introspect to the bottom,

48:09.200 --> 48:12.200
if it's always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,

48:14.400 --> 48:18.360
isn't that paralyzing for the scientific mind?

48:18.360 --> 48:20.320
Well, it's interesting that you say

48:20.320 --> 48:22.120
introspect to the bottom.

48:23.080 --> 48:27.320
Because there is one, I mean, again,

48:27.320 --> 48:28.880
this is in the same spirit of what I said before,

48:28.880 --> 48:30.960
which is it depends on what answer you give

48:30.960 --> 48:32.760
to what's beyond space time,

48:32.760 --> 48:35.120
what answer we would give to your question, right?

48:35.120 --> 48:39.600
So, but one answer that is interesting to explore

48:39.600 --> 48:40.920
is something that spiritual traditions

48:40.920 --> 48:42.520
have said for thousands of years,

48:42.520 --> 48:43.600
but haven't said precisely.

48:43.600 --> 48:45.800
So we can't take it seriously in science

48:45.800 --> 48:46.840
until it's made precise,

48:46.840 --> 48:49.360
but we might be able to make it precise.

48:49.400 --> 48:53.160
And that is that they've also said something like

48:53.160 --> 48:54.800
space and time aren't fundamental,

48:54.800 --> 48:56.840
they're Maya, they're illusion.

48:56.840 --> 49:01.360
And, but that if you look inside, if you introspect

49:03.240 --> 49:05.920
and let go of all of your particular perceptions,

49:07.280 --> 49:10.320
you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought.

49:11.280 --> 49:15.360
And that is, they claim,

49:15.360 --> 49:17.600
being in contact with the deep ground of being

49:17.600 --> 49:21.240
that transcends any particular conceptual understanding.

49:21.240 --> 49:24.360
If that is correct, and I'm not saying it's correct,

49:24.360 --> 49:26.040
but I'm not saying it's not correct.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.360
I'm just saying, if that's correct,

49:28.360 --> 49:30.720
then it would be the case that as scientists,

49:30.720 --> 49:34.120
because we also are in touch with this ground of being,

49:34.120 --> 49:38.360
we would then not be able to conceptually understand

49:38.360 --> 49:40.160
ourselves all the way,

49:40.160 --> 49:43.560
but we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.

49:43.560 --> 49:47.280
And so we would, there would be a sense in which

49:47.360 --> 49:50.880
there is a fundamental grounding to the whole enterprise

49:50.880 --> 49:53.360
because we're not separate from the enterprise.

49:53.360 --> 49:57.440
This is the opposite of the impersonal third-person science.

49:57.440 --> 50:01.680
This would make science go personal all the way down.

50:01.680 --> 50:04.040
And, but nevertheless, scientific,

50:04.040 --> 50:06.200
because the scientific method would still be

50:07.120 --> 50:09.360
what we would use all the way down

50:09.360 --> 50:10.480
for the conceptual understanding.

50:10.480 --> 50:11.480
Unfortunately, you still don't know

50:11.480 --> 50:12.800
if you went all the way down.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.960
It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is,

50:15.960 --> 50:17.320
and we'll talk about it,

50:17.320 --> 50:22.320
is getting the cliche statement of be yourself.

50:24.920 --> 50:28.560
It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality,

50:28.560 --> 50:31.800
but you still don't know when you get to the bottom.

50:31.800 --> 50:34.480
You know, a lot of people, they'll take psychedelic drugs

50:34.480 --> 50:38.000
and they'll say, well, that takes my mind to certain places

50:38.000 --> 50:41.160
where it feels like that is revealing

50:41.160 --> 50:43.160
some deeper truth of reality,

50:43.160 --> 50:46.880
but you still, it could be interfaces on top of interfaces.

50:46.880 --> 50:51.880
That's, in your view of this, you really don't know.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.120
I mean, it's Gato's incompleteness

50:54.120 --> 50:55.680
is that you really don't know.

50:55.680 --> 50:58.480
My own view on it, for what it's worth,

50:59.800 --> 51:00.720
because I don't know the right answer,

51:00.720 --> 51:05.720
but my own view on it right now is that it's never ending.

51:05.800 --> 51:08.400
I think that there will never, that this is great,

51:08.400 --> 51:12.080
as I said before, great job security for science.

51:12.080 --> 51:14.920
And that we, if this is true,

51:14.920 --> 51:17.600
and if consciousness is somehow important

51:17.600 --> 51:19.040
or fundamental in the universe,

51:19.040 --> 51:20.680
this may be an important fundamental fact

51:20.680 --> 51:22.040
about consciousness itself,

51:22.040 --> 51:25.120
that it's a never ending exploration

51:25.120 --> 51:27.560
that's going on in some sense.

51:27.560 --> 51:30.120
Well, well, that's interesting.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.960
Push back on the job security.

51:31.960 --> 51:32.800
Okay.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.560
So maybe as we understand this kind of idea

51:37.560 --> 51:40.920
deeper and deeper, we understand that the pursuit

51:40.920 --> 51:42.960
is not a fruitful one.

51:42.960 --> 51:45.200
Then maybe we need to,

51:45.200 --> 51:48.440
maybe that's why we don't see aliens everywhere,

51:48.440 --> 51:51.280
is you get smarter and smarter and smarter.

51:51.280 --> 51:55.640
You realize that exploration is,

51:55.640 --> 51:59.280
there's other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.

51:59.280 --> 52:04.000
You could be sort of living maximally

52:04.000 --> 52:05.920
in some way that's not exploration.

52:07.880 --> 52:10.040
There's all kinds of video games you can construct

52:10.040 --> 52:11.800
and put yourself inside of them

52:11.800 --> 52:15.200
that don't involve you going outside of the game world.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.720
It's, you know, feeling, from my human perspective,

52:18.720 --> 52:20.960
what seems to be fun is challenging yourself

52:20.960 --> 52:22.640
and overcoming those challenges.

52:22.640 --> 52:25.200
So you can constantly artificially generate challenges

52:25.200 --> 52:28.280
for yourself, like Sisyphus and his boulder.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.640
Just, and that's it.

52:30.640 --> 52:32.240
So the scientific method

52:32.240 --> 52:34.000
that's always reaching out to the stars,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.560
that's always trying to figure out the puzzle

52:35.560 --> 52:36.880
on bottom puzzle,

52:36.880 --> 52:40.520
that's always trying to get to the bottom turtle.

52:40.520 --> 52:43.960
Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition

52:43.960 --> 52:47.400
that that's infinite pursuit, we get,

52:48.840 --> 52:51.080
we agreed to start deviating from that pursuit

52:51.080 --> 52:53.160
and start enjoying the here and now

52:53.160 --> 52:56.560
versus the looking out into the unknown always.

52:56.560 --> 52:58.960
Maybe that's looking out into the unknown

52:58.960 --> 53:03.960
as a early activity for a species.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.600
For a species that's evolved.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.840
I'm just sort of saying, pushing back,

53:09.840 --> 53:12.200
as you probably got a lot of scientists excited

53:12.200 --> 53:13.640
in terms of job security,

53:13.640 --> 53:17.760
I could envision where it's not job security

53:17.760 --> 53:20.760
or scientists become more and more useless.

53:22.040 --> 53:25.480
Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom

53:26.680 --> 53:29.680
that allows us to study our own history,

53:29.680 --> 53:32.320
but not much more than that.

53:32.320 --> 53:34.520
Just to find pushback.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.520
That's good pushback.

53:36.520 --> 53:39.360
I'll put one in there for the scientists again,

53:39.360 --> 53:41.480
but sure, but then I'll take the other side too.

53:41.480 --> 53:46.480
So when Faraday did all of his experiments

53:46.720 --> 53:49.400
with magnets and electricity and so forth,

53:49.400 --> 53:52.080
he came up with all this wonderful empirical data

53:52.080 --> 53:54.160
and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it

53:54.160 --> 53:56.160
and wrote down a few equations,

53:56.160 --> 53:58.240
which we can now write down in a single equation,

53:58.240 --> 54:00.200
the Maxwell equation if we use geometric algebra,

54:00.200 --> 54:01.160
just one equation.

54:03.320 --> 54:07.000
That opened up unbelievable technologies.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.480
People are zooming and talking to each other

54:09.480 --> 54:13.680
around the world, the whole electronics industry.

54:13.680 --> 54:17.160
There was something that transformed our lives

54:17.160 --> 54:21.840
in a very positive way with the theories beyond space time.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.880
Here's one potential.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.880
Right now, most of the galaxies that we see,

54:30.160 --> 54:31.160
we can see them,

54:31.160 --> 54:32.560
but we know that we could never get to them

54:32.560 --> 54:34.120
no matter how fast we traveled.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.520
They're going away from us at the speed of light or beyond,

54:37.520 --> 54:39.280
so we can't ever get to them.

54:39.280 --> 54:40.720
So there's all this beautiful real estate

54:40.720 --> 54:42.680
that's just smiling and waving at us

54:42.680 --> 54:44.840
and we can never get to it.

54:44.840 --> 54:47.360
But that's if we go through space time.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.800
But if we recognize that space time is just a data structure,

54:50.800 --> 54:52.680
it's not fundamental.

54:52.680 --> 54:56.080
We're not little things inside space time.

54:56.080 --> 55:00.200
Space time is a little data structure in our perceptions.

55:00.240 --> 55:02.120
It's just the other way around.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.360
Once we understand that,

55:04.280 --> 55:05.960
and we get equations for the stuff

55:05.960 --> 55:07.160
that's beyond space time,

55:09.120 --> 55:10.640
maybe we won't have to go through space time.

55:10.640 --> 55:11.800
Maybe we can go around it.

55:11.800 --> 55:13.320
Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri

55:13.320 --> 55:14.280
and not go through space.

55:14.280 --> 55:16.800
I can just go right there directly.

55:16.800 --> 55:17.640
It's a data structure.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.320
We can start to play with it.

55:19.320 --> 55:23.600
So I think that for what it's worth,

55:23.600 --> 55:28.600
my take would be that the endless sequence of theories

55:28.600 --> 55:31.120
that we could contemplate building

55:31.120 --> 55:34.400
will lead to an endless sequence

55:34.400 --> 55:38.600
of new remarkable insights into the potentialities,

55:38.600 --> 55:42.440
the possibilities that would seem miraculous to us

55:42.440 --> 55:45.880
and that we will be motivated to continue the exploration

55:45.880 --> 55:49.600
partly just for the technological innovations

55:49.600 --> 55:51.440
that come out.

55:51.440 --> 55:54.480
But the other thing that you mentioned though,

55:54.480 --> 55:56.240
what about just being?

55:56.240 --> 55:57.840
What about just being?

55:57.840 --> 56:00.480
What if we decide instead of all this doing

56:00.480 --> 56:02.360
and exploring what about being,

56:02.360 --> 56:06.680
my guess is that the best scientists will do both

56:06.680 --> 56:11.680
and that the act of being will be a place

56:12.520 --> 56:14.920
where they get many of their ideas

56:14.920 --> 56:18.800
and that they then pull into the conceptual realm.

56:18.800 --> 56:21.040
And I think many of the best scientists,

56:21.040 --> 56:22.160
Einstein comes to mind, right?

56:22.160 --> 56:23.000
Where these guys say,

56:23.080 --> 56:25.520
look, I didn't come up with these ideas

56:25.520 --> 56:27.640
by a conceptual analysis.

56:27.640 --> 56:30.240
I was thinking in vague images

56:30.240 --> 56:34.040
and it was just something non-conceptual.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.880
And then it took me a long, long time to pull it out

56:36.880 --> 56:40.680
into concepts and then longer to put it into math.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.480
But the real insights didn't come

56:42.480 --> 56:45.720
from just slavishly playing with equations.

56:45.720 --> 56:48.320
They came from a deeper place.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.600
And so there may be this going back and forth

56:51.600 --> 56:54.720
between the complete non-conceptual

56:54.720 --> 56:57.640
where there's essentially no end to the wisdom

56:57.640 --> 56:58.800
and then conceptual systems

56:58.800 --> 57:02.200
where there's the girdle limits that we have to that.

57:02.200 --> 57:03.040
And that may be,

57:03.040 --> 57:06.320
if consciousness is important and fundamental,

57:06.320 --> 57:07.600
that may be what consciousness,

57:07.600 --> 57:09.360
at least part of what consciousness is about

57:09.360 --> 57:11.880
is this discovering itself,

57:11.880 --> 57:14.040
discovering its possibilities, so to speak.

57:14.040 --> 57:16.040
We can talk about what that might mean.

57:17.240 --> 57:20.880
By going from the non-conceptual to the conceptual

57:20.880 --> 57:22.160
and back and forth.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.440
So you get better and better and better at being.

57:26.440 --> 57:27.480
Right.

57:27.480 --> 57:29.920
Let me ask you just to linger on the evolutionary,

57:31.080 --> 57:33.120
because you mentioned evolutionary game theory

57:33.120 --> 57:35.280
and that's really where you,

57:35.280 --> 57:37.040
the perspective from which you come

57:38.520 --> 57:40.160
to form the case against reality.

57:42.080 --> 57:45.360
At which point in our evolutionary history

57:45.360 --> 57:49.520
do we start to deviate the most from reality?

57:49.520 --> 57:54.520
Is it way before life even originated on earth?

57:55.800 --> 58:00.800
Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?

58:02.280 --> 58:05.080
Or is it when some inklings

58:05.080 --> 58:06.760
of what we think of as intelligence

58:06.760 --> 58:11.760
or maybe even complex consciousness started to emerge?

58:12.880 --> 58:14.840
So where did this deviation,

58:15.960 --> 58:19.480
just like with the interfaces in a computer,

58:20.480 --> 58:23.920
you start with transistors and then you have assembly

58:23.920 --> 58:28.160
and then you have C, C++, then you have Python,

58:28.160 --> 58:30.320
then you have GUIs and all that kind of,

58:30.320 --> 58:31.480
you have layers upon layers.

58:31.480 --> 58:33.320
When do we start to deviate?

58:33.320 --> 58:36.320
Well, David Maher, again, my advisor at MIT,

58:37.480 --> 58:41.080
in his book, Vision, suggested that the more primitive

58:41.080 --> 58:45.800
sensory systems were less realistic, less veridical,

58:45.800 --> 58:47.000
but that by the time you got to something

58:47.000 --> 58:48.240
as complicated as the humans,

58:48.240 --> 58:52.280
we were actually estimating the true shapes and distances

58:52.280 --> 58:53.960
to objects and so forth.

58:53.960 --> 58:57.080
So his point of view, and I think it was probably,

58:57.080 --> 59:01.640
it's not an uncommon view among my colleagues

59:01.640 --> 59:06.200
that, yeah, the sensory systems of lower creatures

59:06.200 --> 59:10.040
may just not be complicated enough to give them much truth.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.880
But as you get to 86 billion neurons,

59:12.880 --> 59:14.120
you can now compute the truth,

59:14.120 --> 59:17.160
or at least the parts of the truth that we need.

59:17.600 --> 59:19.560
When I look at evolutionary game theory,

59:21.680 --> 59:24.120
one of my graduate students, Justin Mark,

59:24.120 --> 59:27.680
did some simulations using genetic algorithms.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.640
So there he was just exploring,

59:30.640 --> 59:32.120
we start off with random organisms,

59:32.120 --> 59:36.320
random sensory genetics and random actions

59:36.320 --> 59:38.480
and the first generation was unbelievably,

59:38.480 --> 59:39.680
it was a foraging situation,

59:39.680 --> 59:41.320
they were foraging for resources.

59:41.320 --> 59:44.160
Most of them stayed in one place,

59:44.160 --> 59:45.920
didn't do anything important

59:45.920 --> 59:50.920
and but we could then just look at how the genes evolved

59:51.160 --> 59:53.760
and what we found was,

59:53.760 --> 59:58.760
what he found was that basically you never even saw

59:59.920 --> 01:00:04.920
the truth organisms even come on the stage.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.800
If they came up, they were gone in one generation,

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.440
they just weren't.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:14.440
So they came and went even just in one generation,

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.320
they just are not good enough.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.000
The ones that were just tracking,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.880
their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.880
were far more fit than the truth seekers.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.520
So an answer at one level,

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.800
I'm gonna give an answer at a deeper level,

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.200
but just with evolutionary game theory

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.480
because my attitude as a scientist is,

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.080
I don't believe any of our theories.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.280
I take them very, very seriously, I study them,

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.360
I look at their implications,

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.920
but none of them are the gospel,

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.200
they're just the latest ideas that we have.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.640
And so the reason I study evolutionary game theory

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.800
is because that's the best tool we have right now

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.320
in this area, there is nothing else that competes.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.560
And so as a scientist, it's my responsibility

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:02.040
to take the best tools and see what they mean.

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.760
And the same thing the physicists are doing,

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.840
they're taking the best tools

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.240
and looking at what they entail.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.680
But I think that science now has enough experience

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.960
to realize that we should not believe our theories

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.920
in the sense that we've now arrived.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:22.400
In 1890, it was a lot of physicists thought we'd arrived,

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.640
they were discouraging bright young students

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.760
from going into physics because it was all done.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.400
And that's precisely the wrong attitude forever,

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.520
it's the wrong attitude forever.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.600
The attitude we should have is a century from now,

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.560
they'll be looking at us and laughing

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:41.720
at what we didn't know.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.120
And we just have to assume that that's going to be the case.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.880
Just know that everything that we think is so brilliant

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.240
right now, our final theory,

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:50.840
a century from now, they'll look at us

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.600
like we look at the physicists of 1890 and go,

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.080
how could they have been so dumb?

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.960
So I don't wanna make that mistake.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.800
So I'm not doctrinaire about

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.920
any of our current scientific theories.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.280
I am doctrinaire about this.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.000
We should use the best tools we have right now.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.080
And with humility.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.520
Well, so let me ask you about game theory.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.960
There's, I love game theory, evolution game theory,

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.640
but I'm always suspicious of it, like economics.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.520
When you construct models, it's too easy to construct things

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.880
that oversimplify just because we, our human brains,

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.200
enjoy the simplification of constructing

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.840
a few variables that somehow represent organisms

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.800
or represent people and running a simulation

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.080
that then allows you to build up intuition.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.560
And then it feels really good because you just can get

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.040
some really deep and surprising intuitions.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:56.240
But how do you know your models aren't the assumptions

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.920
underlying your models on some fundamentally flawed

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.760
and because of that,

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.040
your conclusions are fundamentally flawed.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.240
So I guess my question is what are the limits

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.880
in your use of game theory, evolution game theory,

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:12.520
your experience with it, what are the limits of game theory?

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.800
So I've gotten some pushback from professional colleagues

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:19.360
and friends who have tried to rerun simulations

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.880
and try to, I mean, the idea that we don't see the truth

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.720
is not comfortable.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.880
And so many of my colleagues are very interested

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.440
in trying to show that we're wrong.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.640
And so the idea would be to say that somehow

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.600
we did something, as you're suggesting,

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.800
maybe something special that wasn't completely general.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.160
We've got some little special part

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.280
of the whole search space in evolutionary game theory

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.080
in which this happens to be true, but more generally,

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.680
organisms would evolve to see the truth.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.680
So the best pushback we've gotten is from a team at Yale.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.680
And they suggested that if you use thousands

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.440
of payoff functions, so we, in our simulations,

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.800
we just use a couple, one or two,

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.320
because it was our first simulations, right?

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.280
So that would be a limit.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.400
We had one or two payoff functions.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.920
We showed the result in those,

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120
at least for the genetic algorithms.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.480
And they said, if you have 20,000 of them,

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.200
then we can find these conditions

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.280
in which truth-seeking organisms

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.400
would be the ones that evolved and survived.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.160
And so we looked at their simulations

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.080
and it certainly is the case that you can find special cases

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.600
in which truth can evolve.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.200
So when I say it's probability zero,

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.200
it doesn't mean it can't happen.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.280
It can happen.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.000
In fact, it could happen infinitely often.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.400
It's just probability zero.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.280
So probability zero things can happen infinitely often.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.560
When you say probability zero,

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.000
you mean probability close to zero?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.160
To be very, very precise.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.800
So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane,

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.480
and I use a measure in which the,

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.640
on a probability measure in which the area

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.280
of a region is this probability,

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.680
then if I draw a curve in that unit square,

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.480
it has measure precisely zero,

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.800
precisely, not approximately, precisely zero.

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.160
And yet it has infinitely many points.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.240
So there's an object that,

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.520
for that probability measure has probability zero,

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.320
and yet there's infinitely many points in it.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.360
So that's what I mean when I say

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.920
that the things that are probability zero

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.800
can happen infinitely often in principle.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.120
Yeah, but infinity, as far as,

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.560
and I look outside often,

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.240
I walk around and I look at people.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.640
I haven't never seen infinity in real life.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.040
That's an interesting issue.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.600
I've been looking, I've been looking.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.240
I don't notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.400
And so the tools of mathematics,

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.720
you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.240
that it is a very convenient interface into a reality.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:50.520
That's a big debate in mathematics,

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.280
the intuitionists versus the ones who take,

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.160
for example, the real numbers as real.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.120
And that's a fun discussion.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.080
Nicholas Gieson has a physicist

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.920
who said really interesting work recently

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.200
on how if you go with intuitionist mathematics,

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.000
you could effectively quantize Newton.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.480
And you find that Newtonian theory and quantum theory

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.520
aren't that different once you go with it.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.360
It's funny.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:18.400
It's really quite interesting.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.040
So the issue you raise is a very, very deep one

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.760
and one that I think we should take quite seriously,

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.680
which is, how should we think about the reality

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.440
of the Contras hierarchy?

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:35.440
ALF one, ALF two, and all these different infinities

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.880
versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:45.280
So where everything's computable in some sense,

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.240
everything's finite, as big as you want,

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.800
but nevertheless, finite.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.480
So yeah, that ultimately boils down to whether

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:58.480
the world is discrete or continuous in some general sense.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.200
And again, we can't really know,

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.480
but there's just a mind-breaking thought,

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.880
just common sense reasoning, that something can happen

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.800
and is yet probability of it happening is 0%.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.120
That doesn't compute for common sense computer.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.800
Right, this is where you have to be a sharp mathematician

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.480
to really, and I'm not.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:25.000
Sharp is one word.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.440
What I'm saying is common sense computer is,

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.440
I mean that in a very kind of, in a positive sense,

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.280
because we've been talking about perception systems

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.160
and interfaces, if we are to reason about the world,

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.080
we have to use the best interfaces we got.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:50.080
And I'm not exactly sure that game theory

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.800
is the best interface we got for this.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.640
Oh, right.

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.720
And application of mathematics, tricks and tools

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.600
of mathematics to game theory is the best we got

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.920
when we're thinking about the nature of reality

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.560
and fitness functions and evolution, period.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.040
Well, that's a fair rejoinder,

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:14.080
and I think that that was the tool that we used.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.320
And if someone says, here's a better mathematical tool

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.240
and here's why, this mathematical tool

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.280
better captures the essence of Darwin's idea.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.960
John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.320
with evolutionary game theory.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.520
There's this thing.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.640
Now, there are tools like evolutionary graph theory,

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.840
which generalize evolutionary game theory.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.560
And then there's quantum game theory.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.560
So you can use quantum tools like entanglement,

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.480
for example, as a resource in games

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.280
that change the very nature of the solutions,

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.880
of the optimal solutions of the game theory.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.440
Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.560
It's a really interesting challenge of that kind of,

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.080
of these ideas where, okay,

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.800
if you have a very large number of fitness functions,

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:06.320
or let's say you have a nearly infinite number

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.480
of fitness functions or a growing number

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.720
of fitness functions,

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.720
what kind of interesting things start to emerging

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.560
if you are to be an organism.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.720
If to be an organism that adapts means having to deal

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:22.400
with an ensemble of fitness functions.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:26.680
Right, and so we've actually redone some

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.040
of our own work based on theirs.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.160
And this is the back and forth that we expect

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:32.320
in science, right?

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.360
And what we found was that they, in their simulations,

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.160
they were assuming that you couldn't carve the world

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.080
up into objects.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.960
And so we said, well, let's relax that assumption.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.000
Allow organisms to create data structures

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.720
that we might call objects.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.440
And an object would be, you take,

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.600
you would do hierarchical clustering

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.200
of your fitness payoff functions,

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.840
the ones that have similar shapes.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.440
If you have 20,000 of them,

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.560
maybe these 50 are all very, very similar.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.640
So I can take all the perception, action, fitness stuff

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.720
and make that into a data structure

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.320
and we'll call that a unit or an object.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.680
And as soon as we did that,

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.640
then all of their results went away.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.440
It turned out they were the special case

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:17.880
and that the organisms that were allowed to only see,

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:21.520
that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.960
were the ones that were.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.400
So the idea is that objects then,

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.200
what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.160
We thought that when I saw a bottle,

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.280
it was because I was seeing a true object that existed

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.400
whether or not it was perceived.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.960
Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:41.160
I'm seeing a data structure that is encoding

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.440
a convenient way of looking at various fitness payoffs.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.320
I can use this for drinking.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.760
I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.880
I could beat someone with head with it.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.640
If my goal is mating, this is pointless.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.720
So I'm seeing for, what I'm coding here

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.240
is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.520
When I pick up an apple,

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:08.760
now I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.280
When I pick up a rock, I'm getting,

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.760
so for every object,

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.120
what I'm getting is a different set of payoff functions

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.240
and act with various actions.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.720
And so once you allow that,

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.720
then what you find is once again that truth goes extinct

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.080
and the organisms that just get an interface

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.640
are the ones that went.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.200
But the question, I'm just sneaking up on,

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.280
this is fascinating.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.240
From where do fitness functions originate?

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.200
What gives birth to the fitness functions?

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.400
So if there's a giant black box

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.200
that just keeps giving you fitness functions,

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.240
what are we trying to optimize?

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.520
You said that water has different

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.360
uses than an apple.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.040
So there's these objects.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.880
What are we trying to optimize?

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.600
And why is not reality

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.880
a really good generator of fitness functions?

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.480
So each theory makes its own assumptions

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.680
and says, grant me this and I'll explain that.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.080
So evolutionary game theory says,

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.480
grant me fitness payoffs, right?

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:16.400
And grant me strategies with payoffs

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.600
and I can write down the matrix

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.360
for this strategy interacts with that strategy.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.680
These are the payoffs that come up.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.520
If you grant me that,

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.600
then I can start to explain a lot of things.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.360
You can ask for a deeper question like,

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.360
okay, how does physics evolve biology

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:36.040
and where do these fitness payoffs come from, right?

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:41.040
Now, that's a completely different enterprise

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:43.120
and of course evolutionary game theory then

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.320
would be not the right tool for that.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.440
It would have to be a deeper tool

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.280
that shows where evolutionary game theory comes from.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.240
My own take is that there's gonna be a problem

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:00.240
in doing that because space time isn't fundamental.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.280
It's just a user interface

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.240
and that the distinction that we make

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.480
between living and non-living

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.600
is not a fundamental distinction.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.160
It's an artifact of the limits of our interface, right?

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.120
So this is a new wrinkle and this is an important wrinkle.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.280
It's so nice to take space and time as fundamental

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.280
because if something looks like it's inanimate,

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.160
it's inanimate and we can just say it's not living.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.760
Now, it's much more complicated.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.200
Certain things are obviously living.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.160
I'm talking with you.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.560
I'm obviously interacting

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.640
with something that's alive and conscious.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.680
I think we've let go of the word obviously

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.000
in this conversation.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.480
I think nothing is obvious.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.280
Nothing's obvious, that's right.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.720
But when we get down to like an ant,

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.000
it's obviously living,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.560
but I'll say it appears to be living.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.480
But when we get down to a virus,

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.280
now people wonder and when we get down to protons,

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.840
people say it's not living.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.640
And my attitude is, look, I have a user interface.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:05.800
The interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.800
and others to, it's an uneven representation,

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:11.960
put it that way.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:14.000
Certain things just get completely hidden.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.640
Dark matter and dark energy

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.800
are most of the energy and matter that's out there.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:22.160
Our interface just plain flat out hides them.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.120
The only way we get some hint

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:27.600
is because gravitational things are going wrong

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:31.960
within our, so most things are outside of our interface.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.160
The distinction between living and non-living

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.000
is not fundamental.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.200
It's an artifact of our interface.

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:41.880
So if we really want to understand

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.360
where evolution comes from,

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.760
to answer the question, the deep question you asked,

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.680
I think the right way we're gonna have to do that

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.160
is to come up with a deeper theory than space-time,

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.360
in which there may not be the notion of time.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.320
And show that whatever this dynamics

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.880
of that deeper theory is,

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.120
by the way, I'll talk about

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.440
how you could have dynamics without time,

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.160
but the dynamics of this deeper theory,

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.040
when we project it into, in certain ways,

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.240
then we do get space-time

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.080
and we get what appears

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.040
to be evolution by natural selection.

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.760
So I would love to see evolution by natural selection,

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.280
nature, red, and tooth and claw,

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.480
people fighting, animals fighting for resources

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.240
and the whole bit, come out of a deeper theory

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.600
in which perhaps it's all cooperation.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.960
There's no limited resources and so forth.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:32.200
But as a result of projection, you get space and time,

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.600
and as a result of projection,

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.440
you get nature, red, and tooth and claw,

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:36.480
the appearance of it.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.120
But it's all an artifact of the interface.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.240
I like this idea that the line between living

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.040
and non-living is very important,

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.680
because that's the thing that would emerge

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:52.440
before you have evolution, the idea of death.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.880
So that seems to be an important component

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.040
of natural selection, and if that emerged,

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:05.520
because that's also, you know, asking the question,

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.680
I guess, that I asked, where do fitness functions

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.880
come from, that's like asking

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.000
the old meaning of life question, right,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.520
is what's the why, why, why?

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.360
And one of the big underlying whys,

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.680
okay, you can start with evolution on Earth,

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:26.120
but without living, without life and death,

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.720
without the line between the living and the dead,

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.560
you don't have evolution.

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.600
So what if underneath it, there's no such thing

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.960
as the living and the dead?

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.560
There's no, like this concept of an organism, period.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:42.760
There's a living organism that's defined

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.760
by a volume in space-time that somehow interacts,

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.880
that over time maintains its integrity somehow,

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.640
it has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.400
The outside world, the environment,

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.800
and then inside there's an organism.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.960
So you're defining an organism,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.440
and also you define that organism by the fact

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.280
that it can move, and it can be come alive,

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.120
which you kind of think of as moving,

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.720
combined with the fact that it's keeping itself

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.800
separate from the environment, so you can point out

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.560
that thing is living, and then it can also die.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:25.040
That seems to be of all very powerful components

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.400
of space-time that enable you to have something

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.840
like natural selection and evolution.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.160
Well, and there's a lot of interesting work,

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.200
some of it by collaborators of Karl Friston and others,

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.960
where they have Bayes net kind of stuff

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.800
that they build on, and the notion of a Markov blanket.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.240
So you have some states within this network

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.120
that are inside the blanket, then you have the blanket,

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.800
and then the states outside the blanket,

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.000
and the states inside this Markov blanket

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.280
are conditionally independent of the states

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.400
outside the blanket conditioned on the blanket.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.200
And what they're looking at is that the dynamics

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.440
inside of the states inside the Markov blanket

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.120
seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.000
and react to them in a way.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.280
So it seems like you're doing probabilistic inferences

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.200
in ways that might be able to keep you alive.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.560
So there's interesting work going on in that direction,

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.560
but what I'm saying is something slightly different,

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:24.800
and that is, like when I look at you,

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.400
all I see is skin, hair, and eyes, right?

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.480
That's all I see.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.200
But I know that there's a deeper reality.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.640
I believe that there's a much deeper reality.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.280
There's the whole world of your experiences,

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.840
your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.680
In some sense, the face that I see

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.120
is just a symbol that I create, right?

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.840
And as soon as I look away, I delete that symbol,

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.320
but I don't delete you.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.520
I don't delete the conscious experience,

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.280
the whole world of your...

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.520
So I'm only deleting an interface symbol,

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.520
but that interface symbol is a portal, so to speak.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.400
Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.320
into your beliefs, into your conscious experiences.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.040
That's why we can have a conversation.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.200
Your consciousness is genuinely affecting mine,

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.920
and mine is genuinely affecting yours,

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.640
through these icons, which I create on the fly.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.760
I create your face.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.120
When I look, I delete it.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.080
I don't create you, your consciousness.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:25.000
That's there all the time, but I do...

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.440
So now when I look at a cat,

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.920
I'm creating something that I still call living,

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.920
and I still think is conscious.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.920
When I look at an ant,

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.480
I create something that I still would call living,

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.160
but maybe not conscious.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.720
When I look at something I call a virus,

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.920
now I'm not even sure I would call it living.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.800
And when I look at a proton,

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.920
I would say I don't even think it's not alive at all.

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.120
It could be that I'm nevertheless

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.720
interacting with something that's just as conscious as you.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.480
I'm not saying the proton is conscious.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.440
The face that I'm creating when I look at you,

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.560
that face is not conscious.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.680
That face is a data structure in me.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.480
That face, it's an experience, it's not an experiencer.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:12.720
Similarly, a proton is something that I create

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.040
when I look, or do a collision

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:18.200
in the Large Hadron Collider or something like that.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.440
But what is behind the entity in space-time?

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.160
So I've got this space-time interface,

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.600
and I've just got this entity that I call a proton.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.520
What is the reality behind it?

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.800
Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures,

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.960
Amplitude Hadron, the Associated Hadron.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.040
What's behind those?

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.720
Could be consciousness, what I'm playing with.

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:41.200
In which case, when I'm interacting with a proton,

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.720
I could be interacting with consciousness.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.240
Again, to be very, very clear,

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.960
because it's easy to misunderstand,

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.320
I'm not saying a proton is conscious.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.360
Just like I'm not saying your face is conscious.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.400
Your face is a symbol I create,

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.080
and then delete as I look.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.400
So your face is not conscious,

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.080
but I know that that face in my interface,

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.880
the Lex Fridman face that I create,

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.240
is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.080
into your consciousness.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.960
The portal is less clear for a cat,

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.840
even less clear for an ant,

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.400
and by the time we get down to a proton,

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.920
the portal is not clear at all.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.160
But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:20.200
with consciousness, it just means my interface gave up.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.040
And there's some deeper reality that we have to go after.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:27.000
So your question really forces out a big part

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.160
of this whole approach that I'm talking about.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.640
So it's this portal of the conscious,

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:35.160
I wonder why you can't, your portal is not as good

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:39.280
to a cat, to a cat's consciousness,

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.440
than it is to a human.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.840
Does it have to do with the fact that you're human,

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:47.440
and just similar organisms,

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.960
organisms of similar complexity are able to create portals

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.440
better to each other?

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.600
Or is it just, as you get more and more complex,

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.880
you get better and better portals?

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.200
Well, let me answer one aspect

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200
that I'm more confident about,

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.520
then I'll speculate on that.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.160
Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons?

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.480
Well, and elementary particles more generally,

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.280
so quarks, leptons, and gluons, and so forth.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.320
Well, the reason for that is

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:18.280
because those are just symmetries of space-time.

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.040
More technically, they're irreducible representations

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.960
of the Poincaré group of space-time.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.840
So they're just literally representations

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.560
of the data structure of space-time that we're using.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.840
So that's why they're not very much insightful.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.320
They're just almost entirely tied

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.480
to the data structure itself.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.440
There's not much,

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.560
they're telling you only something about the data structure,

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.960
not behind the data structure.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.720
It's only when we get to higher levels

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.520
that we're starting to, in some sense,

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.280
build portals to what's behind space-time.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.600
Sure, yeah.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.640
So there's more and more complexity

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:02.000
built on top of the interface of space-time with the cat.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.440
So you can actually build a portal, right?

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.440
Yeah, yeah, right.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:12.200
Ah, yeah, this interface of face and hair and so on, skin.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.120
There's some syncing going on between humans, though,

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.000
where we sync, like, you're getting

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.280
a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:31.280
and starting to get a foggy view of my memories in my head.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.320
Even though this is the first time we're talking,

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.600
you start to project your own memories.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.680
You start to solve, like, a giant hierarchy of puzzles

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.600
about a human, because we're all,

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.320
there's a lot of similarities, a lot of it rhymes.

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.840
So you start to make a lot of inferences

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.400
and you build up this model of a person.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.400
You have a pretty sophisticated model

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.120
of what's going on underneath.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.520
Again, I just, I wonder if it's possible

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.440
to construct these models about each other

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.880
and nevertheless be very distant

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.080
from an underlying reality.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.240
The syncing.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.080
Yeah, there's a lot of work on this.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.000
So there's some interesting work called Signaling Games

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.360
where they look at how people can coordinate

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.040
and come to communicate.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.120
There's some interesting work that was done

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.080
by some colleagues and friends of mine,

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.320
Lewis Nerens, Natalia Komarova, and Kimberly Jameson,

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:33.320
where they were looking at evolving color words.

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.760
So you have a circle of colors, the color circle,

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:41.040
and they wanted to see if they could get people

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.080
to cooperate and how they carved the color circle

01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:44.900
up into two units of words.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:49.600
And so they had a game theoretic kind of thing

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.640
that they'd had people do.

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.920
And what they found was that when they included,

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.920
so most people are trichromats,

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.920
you have three kinds of cone photoreceptors,

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.480
but there are some, a lot of men,

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.400
7% of men are dichromats,

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.360
they might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.960
They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.520
on the final ways that the whole space of colors

01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:14.880
was carved up and labels attached.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.840
You needed to be able to include the dichromats

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:20.080
in the conversation, and so they had a bigger influence

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:23.000
on how you made the boundaries of the language.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.640
And I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.840
that there's going to be, again, a game,

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.960
perhaps a game where evolutionary

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.600
or genetic algorithm kind of thing that goes on

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.160
in terms of learning to communicate

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.920
in ways that are useful.

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.000
And so yeah, you can use game theory

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.600
to actually explore that or signaling games.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.800
There's a lot of brilliant work on that.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:47.640
I'm not doing it, but there's work out there.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.840
So if it's okay, let us tackle once more

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.680
and perhaps several more times

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.600
after the big topic of consciousness.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.840
Okay.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.600
This very beautiful, powerful things

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.960
that perhaps is the thing that makes us human.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:03.080
What is it?

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.280
What's the role of consciousness in,

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.160
let's say even just the thing we've been talking about,

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.280
which is the formation of this interface,

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:17.400
any kind of ways you want to kind of start talking

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.480
about it.

01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:21.440
Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say.

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:27.640
99% are again, assuming that space time is fundamental,

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.960
particles in space time, matter is fundamental

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.520
and most are reductionist.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.120
And so the standard approach to consciousness

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:42.120
is to figure out what complicated systems of matter

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.000
with the right functional properties

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.560
could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.560
That's the general idea, right?

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.920
So maybe you have to have neurons,

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.920
maybe only if you have neurons,

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.640
but that might not be enough.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.400
They have to, certain kinds of complexity

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.840
in their organization and their dynamics,

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.240
certain kind of network abilities, for example.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.760
So there are those who say, for example,

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.680
that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:18.280
of quantum states of microtubules in neurons, certain.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:22.440
So this is Hamroff and Penrose have this kind of.

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.440
So you start with something physical,

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.560
a property of quantum states of neurons,

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.160
of microtubules in neurons,

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.680
and you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse of those

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.720
is consciousness or conscious experiences

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:40.480
or integrated information theory.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:42.560
Again, you start with something physical

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.880
and if it has the right kind of functional properties,

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.240
it's something they call phi

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.040
with the right kind of integrated information,

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.600
then you have consciousness.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.880
Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Goff, for example,

01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:56.720
where you might say,

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.320
well, in addition to the particles in space and time,

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:03.400
those particles are not just matter,

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.520
they also could have, say, a unit of consciousness.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.320
And so, but once again, you're taking space and time

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.200
and particles as fundamental,

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.080
and you're adding a new property to them,

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.080
say, their consciousness.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.840
And then you have to talk about how when a proton

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.000
and neutron, or proton and electron get together

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:21.840
to form hydrogen,

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.160
then how those consciousnesses merge to,

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.400
or interact to create the consciousness of hydrogen

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.240
and so forth.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.520
There's attention schema theory,

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.760
which again, this is how neural network processes

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.320
representing to the network itself,

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.800
its attentional processes, that could be consciousness.

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:44.320
There's global workspace theory,

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.360
and neuronal global workspace theory.

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.400
So there's many, many theories of this type.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.760
What's common to all of them

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.240
is they assume that space-time is fundamental.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.920
They assume that physical processes

01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:59.600
and space-time is fundamental.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.520
Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.600
it's almost dualist in that regard.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.920
And my attitude is, our best science is telling us

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.280
that space-time is not fundamental.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:17.080
So why is that important here?

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:22.080
Well, for centuries, deep thinkers thought of earth,

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.240
air, fire, and water as the fundamental elements.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:28.560
It was a reductionist kind of idea.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.080
Nothing was more elemental than those,

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.480
and you could sort of build everything up from those.

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.200
When we got the periodic table of elements,

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.000
we realized that, of course,

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.040
we want to study earth, air, fire, and water.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.120
There's combustion science for fire.

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:49.040
There's sciences for all these other things,

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.360
water and so forth.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.920
So we're gonna do science with these things,

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.240
but fundamental, no, no.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.240
If you're looking for something fundamental,

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:58.520
those are the wrong building blocks.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.200
Earth has many, many different kinds of elements

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.680
that project into the one thing that we call earth.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.840
If you don't understand that there's silicon,

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:07.680
that there's iron,

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.040
that there's all these different kinds of things

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.280
that project into what we call earth,

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.840
you're hopelessly lost.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:17.000
You're not fundamentally, you're not gonna get there.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.800
And then after the periodic table,

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.240
then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.480
the particles of the standard model of physics.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.000
And so we actually now know

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.160
that if you really want to get fundamental,

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.640
the periodic table isn't it.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.600
It's good for chemistry,

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.200
and it's just wonderful for chemistry,

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:39.800
but if you're trying to go deep fundamental,

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.480
what is the fundamental science?

01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:42.320
That's not it.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:45.040
You're gonna have to go to quarks, leptons, and gluons,

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.080
and so forth.

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:51.080
Well, now we've discovered space-time itself is doomed.

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.440
Quarks, leptons, and gluons are just

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:56.440
irreducible representations of the symmetries of space-time.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.280
So the whole framework on which consciousness research

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.480
is being based right now is doomed.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.200
And for me, these are my friends and colleagues

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.040
that are doing this.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.000
They're brilliant.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.040
They're absolutely, they're brilliant.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.760
I, my feeling is, I'm so sad

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.760
that they're stuck with this old framework

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.040
because if they weren't stuck,

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.880
like with earth, air, fire, and water,

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.160
you could actually make progress.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.720
So it doesn't matter how smart you are.

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:30.240
If you start with earth, air, fire, and water,

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.000
you're not gonna get anywhere, right?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.840
Can I actually just,

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.040
because the word doomed is so interesting.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.280
Let me give you some options, multiple-choice quiz.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:43.200
Is space-time, we could say is reality,

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.520
the way we perceive it, doomed,

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:54.200
wrong, or fake?

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:59.200
Because doomed just means it could still be right

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:02.720
and we're now ready to go deeper.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:03.880
It would be that.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.480
So it's not wrong.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.360
It's not a complete deviation

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.640
from a journey toward the truth.

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:13.880
Right, it's like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:15.720
There is earth, air, fire, and water.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:19.080
That's a useful framework, but it's not fundamental.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.840
Right, well, there's also wrong,

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.480
which is they used to believe, as I recently learned,

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:27.320
that George Washington was the president,

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.760
the first president of the United States,

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.480
was bled to death for something

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:34.040
that could have been easily treated

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:36.400
because it was believed that you can get,

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.120
actually, I need to look into this further,

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.800
but I guess you get toxins out or demons out.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:41.840
I don't know what you're getting out

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.520
with the bleeding of a person.

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:47.160
So that ended up being wrong,

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.760
but widely believed as a medical tool.

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:55.760
So it's also possible that our assumption of space-time

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:58.920
is not just doomed, but is wrong.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.200
Well, if we believe that it's fundamental, that's wrong.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.320
But if we believe it's a useful tool, that's right.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.120
But it could, see, but bleeding somebody to death

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.120
was believed to be a useful tool.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.120
And that was wrong.

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.840
It wasn't just not fundamental.

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:17.240
It was very, I'm sure there's cases

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:19.000
in which bleeding somebody would work,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.520
but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.840
So it could be that it's wrong,

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:29.160
like it's a side road that's ultimately leading

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.640
to a dead end as opposed to a truck stop or something

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.720
that you can get off of.

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:37.360
My feeling is not the dead end kind of thing.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.520
I think that what the physicists are finding

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.720
is that there are these structures beyond space-time,

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.320
but they project back into space-time.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.280
And so space-time, when they say space-time is doomed,

01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:49.160
they're explicit.

01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:50.440
They're saying it's doomed in the sense

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.800
that we thought it was fundamental.

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:53.240
It's not fundamental.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:57.480
It's a useful, absolutely useful and brilliant data structure,

01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.520
but there are deeper data structures

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.480
like cosmological polytope.

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.000
And space-time is not fundamental.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000
What is doomed in the sense that it's wrong is reductionism.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:14.480
Which is saying space-time is fundamental essentially.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.000
Right, the idea that somehow being smaller

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.520
in space and time or space-time

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.160
is a fundamental nature of reality, that's just wrong.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.240
It turned out to be a useful heuristic

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:29.920
for thermodynamics and so forth,

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.320
and in several other places,

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:33.200
reductionism has been very useful.

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.240
But that's in some sense an artifact

01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:38.120
of how we use our interface.

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.640
Yeah, so you're saying size doesn't matter.

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:43.760
Okay, this is very important for me to write down.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.600
Ultimately.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:45.420
Ultimately.

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:46.260
Ultimately, right.

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:49.760
I mean, it's useful for theories like thermodynamics

01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:51.480
and also for understanding brain networks

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.960
in terms of individual neurons

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.520
and neurons in terms of chemical systems inside cells.

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.360
That's all very, very useful.

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.400
But the idea that we're getting

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.920
to the more fundamental nature of reality, no.

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:08.280
When you get all the way down in that direction,

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.000
you get down to the quarks and gluons.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.880
What you realize is what you've gotten down to

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.320
is not fundamental reality,

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:16.440
just the irreducible representations of a data structure.

01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.840
That's all you've gotten down to.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:21.680
So you're always stuck inside the data structure.

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.680
So you seem to be getting closer and closer.

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.720
I went from neural networks to neurons,

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.720
neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles,

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.040
particles to quarks and gluons.

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:31.560
I'm getting closer and closer to the reality.

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:32.880
No, I'm getting closer and closer

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:35.840
to the actual structure of the data structure

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:38.280
of space and time, the irreducible representations.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:39.720
That's what you're getting closer to,

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:43.200
not to a deeper understanding of what's beyond space-time.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:46.320
We'll also refer, we'll return again

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:48.120
to this question of dynamics

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:51.920
because you keep saying that space-time is doomed,

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.480
but mostly focusing on the space part of that.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.040
It's very interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:01.080
because how do you have dynamics without time

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.960
is the thing I'd love to talk to you a little bit about.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:07.960
But let us return your brilliant whirlwind overview

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:11.480
of the different theories of consciousness

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:12.520
that are out there.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:18.800
What is consciousness if outside of space-time?

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.880
If we think that we want to have a model of consciousness,

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.960
as scientists then have to say,

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.120
what do we want to write down?

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:26.880
What kind of mathematical model

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.680
are we going to write down?

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:29.520
And if you think about it,

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.080
there's lots of things that you might want to write down

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.120
about consciousness, it's a really complicated subject.

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:36.880
So most of my colleagues are saying,

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.360
let's start with matter or neurons

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.960
and see what properties of matter

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.520
could create consciousness.

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.200
But I'm saying that that whole thing is out.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.760
Space-time is doomed, that whole thing is out.

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.440
We need to look at consciousness qua consciousness.

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:53.320
In other words, not as something that arises

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.240
in space and time, but perhaps as something

01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:58.280
that creates space and time as a data structure.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.440
So what do we want?

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.000
And here again, there's no hard and fast rule,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.840
but what you as a scientist have to do

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.840
is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.800
that are going to allow you

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.760
to boot up a comprehensive theory.

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.120
That is the trick.

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:17.360
So what do I want?

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.800
So what I chose to do was to have three things.

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.280
I said that there are conscious experiences,

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:29.000
feeling of headache, the smell of garlic,

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.240
experiencing the color red.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.920
So that's the primitive of a theory.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.840
And the reason I want few primitives,

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.800
because those are the miracles of the theory, right?

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.760
The primitives, the assumptions of the theory

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.400
are the things you're not going to explain.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.000
Those are the things you assume.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.280
And those experiences you particularly mean

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.640
there is a subjectiveness to them.

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.480
That's right.

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:51.680
It's the thing when people refer

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.080
to the hard problem of consciousness

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.880
is it feels like something to look at the color red.

01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:58.920
Okay. Exactly right.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:00.440
It feels like something to have a headache

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:02.800
or to feel upset to your stomach.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.560
It feels like something.

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:09.560
And so I'm going to grant that in this theory

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:12.520
there are experiences and they're fundamental in some sense.

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.880
So conscious experience.

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:15.720
So they're not derived from physics.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.800
They're not functional properties of particles.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.200
They are sui generis.

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:21.800
They're, they exist.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.760
Just like we assume space time exists.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:26.320
I'm now saying space time is just a data structure.

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:29.480
It doesn't exist independent of conscious experiences.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.760
Sorry to interrupt once again,

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.480
but should we be focusing in your thinking on humans alone?

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:40.600
Or is there something about in relation

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.160
to other kinds of organisms

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:44.600
that have a sufficiently high level of complexity

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:49.600
or even, or is there some kind of generalization

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.040
of the panpsychus idea

01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:55.720
that all consciousness permeates all matter

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:58.680
outside of the usual definition

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:01.200
of what matter is inside space time?

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.280
So it's beyond human consciousness.

01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.360
Human consciousness from my point of view

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.480
would be one of a countless variety of consciousnesses.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.080
And even within human consciousness,

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.800
there's countless variety of consciousness within us.

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.440
I mean, you have your left and right hemisphere.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.720
And apparently if you split the corpus callosum,

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.760
the personality of the left hemisphere

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:24.320
and the religious beliefs of the left hemisphere

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.360
can be very different from the right hemisphere.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:30.640
And their conscious experiences can be disjoint.

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.480
One could have one conscious experience.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.880
They can play 20 questions.

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.840
The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.360
and the right hemisphere has to guess

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.880
and it might not get it.

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:43.040
So even within you, it's more than just one consciousness.

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.200
It's lots of consciousnesses.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.680
So the general theory of consciousness that I'm after

01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:50.360
is not just human consciousness,

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.880
it's going to be just consciousness

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:54.080
and I presume human consciousness

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.240
is a tiny drop in the bucket

01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.280
of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:01.120
That said, I should clarify

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.120
that the black hole of consciousness is the home cat.

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:10.280
I'm pretty sure cat's lack is the embodiment of evil

01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:14.560
and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:15.880
So I just want to lay that on the table.

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:16.720
That's the theory I'm working on.

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:17.560
I don't have any good evidence.

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.400
But just-

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:19.240
The black cat.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:20.080
Intuitively.

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:20.920
That's just a shout out.

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.160
Sorry to distract.

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.440
So that's the first assumption.

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:25.280
The first assumption.

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.120
That's fine.

01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:27.920
The second assumption is that

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.120
these experiences have consequences.

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.720
So I'm going to say that conscious experiences

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.480
can trigger other conscious experiences.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.320
They're other conscious experiences, somehow.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.720
So really, in some sense,

01:40:40.720 --> 01:40:43.720
there's two basic assumptions.

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:44.560
They're conscious-

01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.160
So there's some kind of causality.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.760
Is there a chain of causality?

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.280
Does this relate to dynamics?

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.440
I'll say there's a probabilistic relationship.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.280
Okay.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.840
So I'm trying to be as nonspecific to begin with

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:01.040
and see where it leads me.

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:03.960
So what I can write down are probability spaces.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.080
So probability space,

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:08.160
which contains the conscious experiences

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.520
that this consciousness can have.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.840
So I'll,

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.600
I call this a conscious agent.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:15.640
This technical thing.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.280
Annika Harris and I have talked about this,

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.880
and she rightly cautions me that people will think

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.120
that I'm bringing in a notion of a self or agency

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.440
and so forth when I say conscious agent.

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:30.000
So I just want to say that I use the term conscious agent

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.280
merely as a technical term.

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.240
There is no notion of self

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.640
in my fundamental definition of a conscious agent.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.800
There are only experiences

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.080
and probabilistic relationships

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.000
of how they trigger other experiences.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.280
So the agent is the generator of the conscious experience?

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.600
The agent is a mathematical structure

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.920
that includes a probability measure,

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:56.000
the probability space of possible conscious experiences,

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.240
and a Markovian kernel,

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:01.080
which describes how if this agent

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.800
has certain conscious experiences,

01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.280
how that will affect the experiences

01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:07.520
of other conscious agents, including itself.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.920
But you don't think of that as a self?

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:13.720
No, there is no notion of a self here.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.560
There's no notion of really of an agent.

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.120
But is there a locality?

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.160
Is there an organism?

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.000
There's no space.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:22.920
There's no, okay.

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:27.920
So this is, these are conscious units, conscious entities.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.480
But they're distinct in some way,

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.320
because they have to interact.

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.680
Well, so here's the interesting thing.

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.120
When we write down the mathematics,

01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:39.320
when you have two of these conscious agents interacting,

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.720
the pair satisfy a definition of a conscious agent.

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:46.200
So they are a single conscious agent.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.560
So there is one conscious agent,

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.400
but it has a nice analytic decomposition

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.240
into as many conscious agents as you wish.

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.560
So that's a nice interface.

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.760
It's a very useful scientific interface.

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:01.400
It's a scale-free, or if you like,

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:03.480
a fractal-like approach to it,

01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:06.360
in which we can use the same unit of analysis

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:09.800
at all scales in studying consciousness.

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:12.280
But if I want to talk about,

01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.080
so there's no notion of learning, memory,

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.840
problem-solving, intelligence, self, agency.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.360
So none of that is fundamental.

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:26.400
So, and the reason I did that was

01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.920
because I want to assume as little as possible.

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.200
Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory.

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.560
It's not something you explain, it's something you assume.

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.440
So I have to build networks of conscious agents.

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:41.560
If I want to have a notion of a self, I have to build a self.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.960
I have to build learning, memory, problem-solving,

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:46.760
intelligence, and planning, all these different things.

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:49.520
I have to build networks of conscious agents to do that.

01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.440
It's a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents

01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:54.720
are computationally universal, that's trivial.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.840
So anything that we can do with neural networks

01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.800
or, you know, automata,

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.000
you can do with networks of conscious agents, that's trivial.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.960
What, but you can also do more.

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:08.880
The events in the probability space need not be computable.

01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:11.160
So the Markovian dynamics

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.080
is not restricted to computable functions,

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.920
because the very events themselves need not be computable.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.240
So this can capture any computable theory.

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.640
Anything we can do with neural networks,

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:25.320
we can do with conscious agent networks.

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:28.160
But it leaves open the door for the possibility

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:32.560
of non-computable interactions between conscious agents.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:35.640
So we have to, if we want a theory of memory,

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.120
we have to build it.

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:39.600
And there's lots of different ways you could build.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.840
We've actually got a paper, Chris Fields took the lead

01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:44.240
on this, and he, we have a paper called

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.800
Conscious Agent Networks, where Chris takes the lead

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:49.040
and shows how to use these networks of conscious agents

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:52.800
to build memory and to build primitive kinds of learning.

01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:56.720
But can you provide some intuition

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.840
of what conscious networks,

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:02.520
network of conscious, networks of conscious agents

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:05.760
helps you, first of all, what that looks like.

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.960
And I don't just mean mathematically,

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.600
of course, maybe that might help build up intuition,

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:14.000
but how that helps us potentially solve

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.480
the hard problem of consciousness.

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.680
Right.

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.640
Or is that baked in, that that exists?

01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:27.120
Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness,

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.400
why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious ice cream

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:33.880
with networks of conscious agents,

01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:36.040
or is that taken as an assumption?

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:41.040
So the standard way the hard problem is thought of is,

01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:44.600
we're assuming space and time and particles,

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.000
or neurons, for example.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.880
These are just physical things that have no consciousness.

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.640
And we have to explain how the conscious experience

01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:54.800
of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those.

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.960
So that's the typical hard problem of consciousness

01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.600
is that problem, right?

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:01.920
How do you boot up the taste of chocolate,

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:06.120
the experience of the taste of chocolate from neurons, say,

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:10.440
or the right kind of artificial intelligence circuitry?

01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.520
How do you boot that up?

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.680
That's typically what the hard problem

01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:15.680
of consciousness means to researchers.

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:18.400
Notice that I'm changing the problem.

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:21.400
I'm not trying to boot up conscious experiences

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.840
from the dynamics of neurons or silicon

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:25.080
or something like that.

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:27.880
I'm saying that that's the wrong problem.

01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:29.960
My hard problem would go in the other direction.

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:33.520
If I start with conscious experiences,

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.680
how do I build up space and time?

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.600
How do I build up what I call the physical world?

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.640
How do I build up what we call brains?

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:43.760
Because I'm saying consciousness is not something

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.680
that brains do.

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.200
Brains are something that consciousness makes up.

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.880
It's among the experience,

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.600
it's an ephemeral experience in consciousness.

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:57.080
I look inside, so to be very, very clear,

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:58.800
right now I have no neurons.

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.240
If you looked, you would see neurons.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.320
That's a data structure that you would create on the fly.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.480
And it's a very useful one.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.600
As soon as you look away,

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.040
you garbage collect that data structure.

01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.840
Just like that Necker cube that I was talking about

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.000
on the piece of paper.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.160
When you look, you see a 3D cube.

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:17.360
You create it on the fly.

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.600
As soon as you look away, that's gone.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.920
When you say you, you mean a human being scientist.

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.600
Right now, that's right.

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.960
More generally, it'll be conscious agents,

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.360
because as you pointed out,

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.920
am I asking for a theory of consciousness

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:31.760
only about humans?

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:34.880
No, it's consciousness, which human consciousness

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.560
is just a tiny sliver.

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:40.160
But you are saying that there is,

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.880
that's a useful data structure.

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:43.800
How many other data structures are there?

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.480
That's why I said you human.

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.520
If there's another earth,

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:49.680
if there's another alien civilization

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.680
and doing these kinds of investigations,

01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.320
would they come up with similar data structures?

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.160
Probably not.

01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:56.560
What is the space of data structures,

01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.000
I guess is what I'm asking.

01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:04.040
My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental,

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.480
consciousness is all there is,

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.440
then the only thing that mathematical structure

01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:13.080
can be about is possibilities of consciousness.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.880
And that suggests to me

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:21.280
that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.120
and a vanishingly small fraction of them

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.840
use space-time data structures

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.520
and the kinds of structures that we use.

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:32.040
There's an infinite variety of data structures.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.600
Now, this is very similar to something

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.000
that Max Tegmark has said,

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.040
but I want to distinguish it.

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.440
He has his level four multiverse idea.

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:43.040
He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.

01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:45.000
And so that's the fundamental reality.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.320
And since there's an infinite variety of,

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.000
endless variety of mathematical structures,

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.560
there's an infinite variety of multiverses, in his view.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.280
I'm saying something similar in spirit,

01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.960
but importantly different.

01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:57.800
There's an infinite variety

01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.720
of mathematical structures, absolutely.

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:03.160
But mathematics isn't the fundamental reality

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.920
in this framework.

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.680
Consciousness is.

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.360
And mathematics is to consciousness

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.000
like bones are to an organism.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:12.840
You need the bones.

01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:16.480
So mathematics is not divorced from consciousness,

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:20.320
but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means.

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:24.400
And so there's an infinite variety of consciousnesses

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.280
and signaling games that consciousnesses

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:30.120
could interact via.

01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:34.320
And therefore, common worlds, data structures,

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.160
that they can use to communicate.

01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:40.200
So space and time is just one of an infinite variety.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:43.200
And so I think that what we'll find

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:46.240
is that as we go outside of our little space-time bubble,

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:51.720
we will encounter utterly alien forms

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:54.880
of conscious experience that we may not be able

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:59.880
to really comprehend in the following sense.

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:03.400
If I ask you to imagine a color

01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:05.000
that you've never seen before,

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.200
does anything happen?

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.560
Right, nothing happens, right?

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:10.840
Yeah, no.

01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:11.680
Nothing happens.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:13.280
And that's just one color.

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:15.000
I'm asking for just a color.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.640
We actually know, by the way,

01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:20.680
that apparently there are women called tetrafams

01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:25.960
who have four color receptors, not just three.

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:29.200
And Kimberly Jamieson and others who've studied these women

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.440
have good evidence that they apparently have

01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.320
a new dimension of color experience

01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:36.200
that the rest of us don't have.

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:40.560
So these women are apparently living in a world of color

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:42.640
that you and I can't even concretely imagine.

01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:44.120
No man can imagine them.

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:44.960
Yeah.

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:47.200
And yet they're real color experiences.

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:49.160
And so in that sense, I'm saying,

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:51.280
now take that little baby step,

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:53.320
oh, there are women who have color experiences

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.160
that I could never have.

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.320
Well, that's shocking.

01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:57.840
Now take that infinite.

01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:00.600
There are consciousnesses where every aspect

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.440
of their experiences is like that new color.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:05.760
It's something utterly alien to you.

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.840
You have nothing like that.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.040
And yet these are all possible varieties

01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:11.320
of conscious experience.

01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:13.360
When you say there's a lot of consciousnesses,

01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.400
as a singular consciousness,

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.920
basically the set of possible experiences you can have

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.240
in that subjective way,

01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:25.040
as opposed to the underlying mechanism.

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:28.000
Because you say that, you know,

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.800
having a extra color receptor,

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:34.080
ability to have new experiences

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.640
that somehow a different consciousness,

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:39.640
is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.480
the subjectivity itself?

01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:42.320
Right.

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:45.200
Because when we have two of these conscious agents

01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:46.720
interacting in mathematics,

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.560
they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent.

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:52.240
So in fact, they are a single conscious agent.

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:54.760
So in fact, one way to think about

01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.360
what I'm postulating with my colleagues,

01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.360
Chetan and Chris and others, Robert Prentner and so forth,

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:05.280
there is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated.

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:08.320
But fortunately, we can, for analytic purposes,

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.720
break it down all the way to, in some sense,

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:11.720
the simplest conscious agent,

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:13.960
which has one conscious experience, one.

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:18.320
This one agent can experience red 35, and that's it.

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.280
That's what it experiences.

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:22.840
You can get all the way down to that.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:26.920
So you think it's possible that consciousness,

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:29.280
whatever that is,

01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:34.040
is much more, is fundamental,

01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:37.520
or at least much more in the direction of the fundamental

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:40.520
than is space-time as we perceive it?

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:42.520
That's the proposal.

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:45.040
And therefore, what I have to do,

01:52:45.040 --> 01:52:47.560
in terms of the heart problem of consciousness,

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:51.680
is to show how dynamical systems of conscious agents

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:55.200
could lead to what we call space and time and neurons

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:56.720
and brain activity.

01:52:56.720 --> 01:53:00.400
In other words, we have to show how you get space-time

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.440
and physical objects

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:06.280
entirely from a theory of conscious agents

01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:07.720
outside of space-time,

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:10.560
with the dynamics outside of space-time.

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:13.960
So that's, and I can tell you how we plan to do that,

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:15.800
but that's the idea.

01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:18.960
Okay, the magic of it, that chocolate is delicious.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:22.800
So there's a mathematical kind of thing

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.680
that we could say here,

01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:25.960
how it can emerge within the system

01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:27.840
of networks of conscious agents,

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:32.840
but is there going to be at the end of the proof

01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:38.320
why chocolate is so delicious, or no?

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:42.000
I guess I'm going to ask different kinds of dumb questions

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.240
to try to sneak up.

01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.840
Oh, well, that's the right question.

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:47.040
And when I say that I took conscious experiences

01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.120
as fundamental,

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:51.600
what that means is in the current version of my theory,

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:54.160
I'm not explaining conscious experiences

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.760
where they came from.

01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:56.600
That's the miracle.

01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:58.200
That's one of the miracles.

01:53:58.200 --> 01:53:59.640
So I have two miracles of my theory.

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:00.720
There are conscious experiences,

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:02.360
like the taste of chocolate,

01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:06.240
and there's a probabilistic relationship.

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.680
When certain conscious experiences occur,

01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:10.600
others are more likely to occur.

01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:12.680
Those are the two miracles that I-

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:17.600
Is it possible to get beyond that

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.600
and somehow start to chip away

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:22.440
at the miracle-ness of that miracle,

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.720
that chocolate is still delicious?

01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:25.560
I hope so.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:27.680
I've got my hands full with what I'm doing right now,

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:31.280
but I can just say at top level

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:32.240
how I would think about that.

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:33.440
That would get at this

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.160
consciousness without form.

01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:44.120
This is gonna be really, this is really tough

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:46.840
because it's consciousness without form

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:50.240
versus the various forms that consciousness takes

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.120
for the experiences that it has.

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:55.120
Right, right.

01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:57.440
So there's, so when I write down

01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:03.040
a probability space for these conscious experiences,

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:04.320
I say, here's a probability space

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:07.120
for the possible conscious experiences, right?

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.800
It's just like when I write down a probability space

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:09.680
for an experiment.

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:12.480
I'm gonna flip a coin twice, right?

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:15.200
And I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes.

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:16.360
So I have to write down a probability space.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.600
There could be heads, heads, heads, tails,

01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:20.400
tails, heads, tails, tails.

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.400
So you before, as any class of probability,

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.360
you're told write down your probability space.

01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:26.720
If you don't write down your probability space,

01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.160
you can't get started.

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:30.640
So here's my probability space for consciousness.

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:33.240
How do I want to interpret that structure?

01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:34.560
The structure is just sitting there.

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:37.520
There's gonna be a dynamics that happens on it, right?

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.640
Experiences appear and then they disappear.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.040
Just like heads appears and disappears.

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:47.040
So one way to think about that fundamental probability space

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:51.280
is that corresponds to consciousness without any content.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.440
The infinite consciousness

01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.840
that transcends any particular content.

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.640
Well, do you think of that as a mechanism, as a thing,

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:07.000
like the rules that govern the dynamics of the thing

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.560
outside of space time?

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:10.720
If you think consciousness is fundamental,

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.800
isn't it essentially getting like,

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:14.960
it is solving the hard problem,

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.960
which is like from where does this thing pop up?

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.360
Which is the mechanism of the thing popping up.

01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.800
Whatever the consciousness is,

01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:29.720
the different kinds, it was so on, that mechanism.

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:32.480
And also the question I want to ask is,

01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:37.480
how tricky do you think it is to solve that problem?

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:40.280
You solved a lot of difficult problems

01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:42.040
throughout the history of humanity.

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:47.600
There's probably more problems to solve left

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:51.520
than we've solved by like an infinity.

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:57.140
But along that long journey of intelligent species,

01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:01.080
when will we solve this consciousness one?

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.000
Just one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.560
So I'll give two answers.

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:07.600
There's one problem I think we can solve,

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:09.880
but we haven't solved yet.

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:12.840
And that is the reverse of what my colleagues

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:13.920
call the hard problem.

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.180
The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences

01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:19.680
in the way that I've just described them and the dynamics

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:21.840
and build up space and time and brains,

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.120
that I think is a tough technical problem,

01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:26.240
but some principle solvable.

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.780
So I think we can solve that.

01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:29.400
So we would solve the hard problem,

01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.280
not by showing how brains create consciousness,

01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:33.080
but how networks of conscious agents

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.000
create what we call the symbols that we call brains.

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.040
So that I think.

01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:41.400
But does that allow you to,

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:42.240
so that's interesting.

01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:43.480
That's an interesting idea.

01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:44.720
Consciousness creates the brain,

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:46.440
not the brain creates consciousness.

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:49.440
But does that allow you to build the thing?

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:53.800
My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies.

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.880
Once, and I'll tell you why.

01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:58.880
I think it plugs into the work that the physicists are doing.

01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:01.920
So this theory of consciousness will be even deeper

01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.960
than the structures that the physicists are finding,

01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.160
like the Amplituhedron.

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.300
But the other answer to your question is less positive.

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:11.800
As I said earlier,

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:13.080
I think that there is no such thing

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.320
as a theory of everything.

01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:19.220
So that I think that my,

01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:21.720
the theory that my team is working on,

01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:23.160
this conscious agent theory,

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.460
is just a 1.0 theory.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.920
We're using probability spaces and Markovian kernels.

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.760
I can easily see people now saying,

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.040
well, we can do better if we go to category theory.

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:38.840
And we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting.

01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:39.760
And then someone will say,

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:41.520
well, now I'll go to topoi theory.

01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:42.400
And then there'll be,

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.580
so I imagine that there'll be,

01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:49.220
conscious agents, five, 10, 3 trillion, 0.0.

01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:51.760
But I think it will never end.

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:53.760
I think ultimately,

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:56.680
this question that we sort of put our fingers on of,

01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:01.680
how does the formless give birth to form?

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:05.780
To the taste, the wonderful taste of chocolate.

01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:10.200
I think that we will always go deeper and deeper,

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.600
but we will never solve that.

01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:15.120
That in some sense, that will be a primitive.

01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.760
I hope I'm wrong.

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:21.220
Maybe it's just the limits of my current imagination.

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:26.000
So I'll just say my imagination right now

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.240
doesn't peer that deep.

01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:30.280
Hopefully, so I don't,

01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:31.640
by the way, I'm saying this,

01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:35.160
I don't want to discourage some brilliant 20 year old

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:37.920
who then later on proves me dead wrong.

01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:39.360
I hope to be proven dead wrong.

01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:41.040
Just like you said, essentially from now,

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.400
everything we're saying now,

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.320
everything you're saying,

01:59:43.320 --> 01:59:45.600
all of your theories will be laughing stock.

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:50.600
They will respect the puzzle solving abilities

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:54.040
and how much we were able to do with so little.

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.160
But outside of that,

01:59:56.160 --> 01:59:58.240
it will all be just,

01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:01.800
the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager.

02:00:01.800 --> 02:00:03.160
Especially the silliness when we thought

02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:06.040
that we were so smart and we knew it all.

02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:08.360
So it would be interesting to explore your ideas

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:12.600
by contrasting, you mentioned Annika, Annika Harris,

02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:14.580
you mentioned Philip Goff.

02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:18.360
So outside of, if you're not allowed to say

02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:21.680
the fundamental disagreement is the fact

02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:23.360
that space time is fundamental,

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.640
what are interesting distinctions

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:28.480
between ideas of consciousness

02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.120
between you and Annika, for example.

02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:33.440
You guys have, you've been on a podcast together.

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:36.320
I'm sure in private,

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:38.160
you guys have some incredible conversations.

02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:41.640
So where are some interesting sticking points,

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:44.080
some interesting disagreements,

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:45.760
let's say with Annika first.

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:47.720
Maybe there'll be a few other people.

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.740
Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning

02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:51.600
where we were talking about our ideas

02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:53.880
and what we discovered really in our conversation

02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:57.080
was that we're pretty much on the same page.

02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:58.680
It was really just-

02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.520
About consciousness.

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:00.960
About consciousness, yeah.

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.080
Our ideas about consciousness

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:04.080
are pretty much on the same page.

02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:07.680
She rightly has cautioned me

02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:10.120
to when I talk about conscious agents

02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.040
to point out that the notion of agency

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:15.840
is not fundamental in my theory.

02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.280
The notion of self is not fundamental

02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.940
and that's absolutely true.

02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:21.720
I can use this network of conscious agents.

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:25.040
I now use as a technical term,

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:26.440
conscious agents is a technical term

02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:29.360
for that probability space with the Markovian dynamics.

02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:31.920
I can use that to build models of a self

02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:33.280
and to build models of agency,

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:35.240
but they're not fundamental.

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:40.240
So she has really been very helpful

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.640
in helping me to be a little bit clear about these ideas

02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:45.920
and not say things that are misleading.

02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:47.480
Sure, the word, I mean,

02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:50.040
this is the interesting thing about language actually

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:52.360
is that language quite obviously

02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:56.680
is an interface to truth.

02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.480
It's so fascinating that individual words

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:05.760
can have so much ambiguity

02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:10.760
and the specific choices of a word

02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.200
within a particular sentence,

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.680
within the context of a sentence

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:17.280
can have so much, such a difference in meaning.

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:18.680
It's quite fascinating,

02:02:18.680 --> 02:02:20.440
especially when you're talking about topics

02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:24.000
like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.200
It means a lot of things to a lot of people

02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.200
and the entire concept is shrouded in mystery.

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:32.520
So combination of the fact that it's a loaded term

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:34.360
and that there's a lot of mystery,

02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:37.000
people can just interpret it in all kinds of ways.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.200
And so you have to be both precise

02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:43.680
and help them avoid getting stuck

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:48.160
on some kind of side road of miscommunication,

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:50.880
lost in translation because you used the wrong word.

02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:51.720
That's interesting.

02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:54.440
I mean, because for a lot of people,

02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:59.160
consciousness is ultimately connected to a self.

02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:04.960
I mean, that's our experience of consciousness

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:08.880
is very, it's connected to this ego.

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:12.880
I mean, I just, I mean, what else could it possibly be?

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:15.800
I can't even, how do you begin to comprehend,

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:19.040
to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:22.440
that's not connected to like this particular organism?

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:25.120
Well, I have a way of thinking

02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:26.560
about this whole problem now

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:29.680
that comes out of this framework that's different.

02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:34.280
So we can imagine a dynamics of consciousness,

02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:37.720
not in space and time, just abstractly.

02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:40.600
It could be cooperative for all we know.

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:42.640
It could be very friendly, I don't know.

02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:46.720
And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics

02:03:46.720 --> 02:03:48.840
that is so-called stationary.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.160
And that's a technical term,

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:53.400
which means that the entropy effectively is not increasing.

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.160
There is some entropy, but it's constant.

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.920
So there's no increasing entropy.

02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:00.320
And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless.

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:02.960
There is no entropic time.

02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:07.960
But it's a trivial theorem, three-line proof

02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:12.080
that if you have a stationary Markovian dynamics,

02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:14.520
any projection that you make of that dynamics

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:16.240
by conditional probability,

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:17.960
and if you want, I can state a little bit more,

02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.360
even more mathematically precisely

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.920
for some readers or listeners.

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:25.120
But if any projection you take by conditional probability,

02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:28.960
the induced image of that Markov chain

02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:30.400
will have increasing entropy.

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:34.560
You will have entropic time.

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.160
So I'll be very, very precise.

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:40.760
I have a Markov chain, X1, X2 through Xn,

02:04:40.760 --> 02:04:42.400
where Xn goes to infinity, right?

02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:48.080
The entropy H, capital H of Xn

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:52.440
is equal to the entropy H of Xn minus one for all n.

02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:54.160
So the entropy is the same.

02:04:55.640 --> 02:05:00.640
But it's a theorem that H of Xn,

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:04.480
say given X sub one,

02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:09.480
is greater than or equal to H of Xn minus one given X1.

02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:13.600
Sure, where does the greater come from?

02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:16.000
Because with the theorem, the three-line proof,

02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:22.240
H of Xn given X1 is greater than or equal to

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:27.520
H of Xn given X1 and X2 because conditioning reduces.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:33.760
But then H of Xn minus one given X1 comma X2

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:39.640
is equal to H of Xn given X2,

02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:43.080
Xn minus one given X2, by the Markov property.

02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:46.240
And then because it's stationary,

02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:49.000
it's equal to H of X,

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:53.160
I have to write it down, Xn minus one.

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.760
Yeah, sure, sure.

02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:56.800
Anyway, there's a three-line proof.

02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.920
Sure, but the assumption of stationarity,

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.520
we're using a lot of terms that people won't understand,

02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:05.360
doesn't matter.

02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:08.440
The, so there's some kind of,

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:12.680
some Markovian dynamics is basically trying to model

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:14.760
some kind of system with some probabilities

02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:17.240
and there's agents and they interact in some kind of way

02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:19.960
and you could say something about that system

02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:22.920
as it evolves stationarity.

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.920
So stationary system is one that has certain properties

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:30.840
in terms of entropy very well.

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:33.040
But we don't know if it's stationary or not.

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:35.520
We don't know what the properties.

02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:36.520
Right.

02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.560
So you have to kind of take assumptions and see,

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:42.040
okay, well, what does the system behave like

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:43.600
under these different properties?

02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:46.360
The more constraints, the more assumptions you take,

02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:48.840
the more predictive, the more interesting,

02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:52.040
powerful things you can say, but sometimes they're limiting.

02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:54.600
That said, we're talking about consciousness here.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.000
How does that, you said cooperative, okay, competitive.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.160
It just, I like chocolate.

02:07:04.160 --> 02:07:08.480
I'm sitting here, I have a brain, I'm wearing a suit.

02:07:08.480 --> 02:07:11.240
It sure as hell feels like I'm myself.

02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:12.080
Right.

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.680
Now, what am I tuning in?

02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:16.800
Am I plugging into something?

02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:20.720
Am I a projection, a simple, trivial projection

02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:23.960
into space time from some much larger organism

02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:25.960
that I can't possibly comprehend?

02:07:25.960 --> 02:07:27.680
How the hell, you're saying some-

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:28.520
Yes.

02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:30.080
You're building up mathematical intuitions.

02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:32.800
Fine, great, but I'm just,

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:35.120
I'm having an existential crisis here

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:36.720
and I'm gonna die soon.

02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:37.960
We'll all die pretty quickly.

02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:42.280
So I wanna figure out why chocolate's so delicious.

02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:44.240
So help me out here.

02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:47.160
So let's just keep sneaking up to this.

02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:52.160
Right, so the whole technical thing was to say this.

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:56.240
Even if the dynamics of consciousness is stationary

02:07:56.240 --> 02:07:58.760
so that there is no entropic time,

02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:02.520
any projection of it, any view of it

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:07.440
will have the artifact of entropic time.

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:12.640
That's a limited resource, limited resources.

02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:15.720
So the fundamental dynamics may have no limits,

02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:17.480
limited resources whatsoever.

02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:20.000
Any projection will have certainly time

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:21.160
as a limited resource

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:24.160
and probably lots of other limited resources.

02:08:24.160 --> 02:08:28.120
Hence, we could get competition and evolution

02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:30.400
and nature, red and tooth and claw

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:32.680
as an artifact of a deeper system

02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:34.600
in which those aren't fundamental.

02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:37.840
And in fact, I take it as something

02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.000
that this theory must do at some point

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.720
is to show how networks of conscious agents,

02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:45.680
even if they're not resource limited,

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:47.600
give rise to evolution of a natural selection

02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:49.320
via a projection.

02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:51.080
Yeah, but you're saying,

02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:53.280
I'm trying to understand how the limited resources

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:57.960
that give rise to, so first the thing gives rise to time,

02:08:58.800 --> 02:08:59.920
it gives rise to limited resource,

02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:03.160
it gives rise to evolution by natural selection,

02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:05.960
how that has to do with the fact that chocolate is delicious.

02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:08.080
Well, it's not gonna do that directly,

02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:10.760
it's gonna get to this notion of self.

02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.920
Oh, it's gonna give you,

02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:14.720
evolution gives you the notion of self.

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:18.480
And also of a self separate from other selves.

02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:20.200
So the idea would be that-

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:22.200
It's competition, it has life and death,

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:23.360
all those kinds of things.

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.200
That's right.

02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:27.240
So it won't, I don't think, as I said,

02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:29.760
I don't think that I can tell you how the formless

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:32.400
gives rise to the experience of chocolate.

02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:33.640
Right now, my current theory says

02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:35.720
that's one of the miracles I'm assuming.

02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:36.680
Yeah.

02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:38.200
So my theory can't do it.

02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:39.280
And the reason my theory can't do it

02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:41.360
is because Hoffman's brain can't do it right now.

02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:46.000
But the notion of self, yes,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.080
the notion of self can be an artifact

02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:51.720
of the projection of it.

02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.800
So there's one conscious agent,

02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:56.800
because anytime conscious agents interact,

02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:57.840
they form a new conscious agent.

02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:59.400
So there's one conscious agent.

02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:02.640
Any projection of that one conscious agent

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:05.080
gives rise to time,

02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:07.680
even if there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent.

02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:10.080
And it gives rise, I want to,

02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.600
now I haven't proven this.

02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:14.840
So now this is me guessing where the theory is gonna go.

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:16.880
I haven't done this, there's no paper on this yet.

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:18.400
So now I'm speculating.

02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:20.200
My guess is I'll be able to show,

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:22.480
or my brighter colleagues working with me

02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:25.720
will be able to show that we will get evolution

02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:28.280
of a natural selection, the notion of individual selves,

02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:29.960
individual physical objects and so forth

02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:31.640
coming out as projection of this thing.

02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:35.880
And that the self, this then will be really interesting

02:10:35.880 --> 02:10:37.440
in terms of how it starts to interact

02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:41.000
with certain spiritual traditions, right?

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.160
Where they will say that there is a notion of self

02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:46.880
that needs to be let go, which is this finite self

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.920
that's competing with other selves to get more money

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:52.040
and prestige and so forth.

02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:54.400
That self in some sense has to die.

02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:58.440
But there's a deeper self, which is the timeless being

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:04.360
that preclude, that precedes, not precludes,

02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:08.240
but precedes any particular conscious experiences,

02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:10.400
the ground of all experience.

02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:13.680
That there's that notion of a deep capital self.

02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:18.040
But our little capital lowercase s selves

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:20.840
could be artifacts of projection.

02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:25.720
And it may be that what consciousness is doing

02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:29.080
in this framework is, right, it's projected itself down

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.480
into a self that calls itself Don

02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:34.000
and a self that calls itself Lex.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.080
And through conversations like this,

02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:37.960
it's trying to find out about itself

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.280
and eventually transcend the limits

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:45.920
of the Don and Lex little icons that it's using

02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:49.080
and that little projection of itself.

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.600
Through this conversation,

02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:53.720
somehow it's learning about itself.

02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:56.680
So that thing dressed me up today

02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:00.000
in order to understand itself.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.280
And in some sense, you and I are not separate

02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:04.000
from that thing and we're not separate from each other.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.040
Yeah, well, I have to question the fashion choices

02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.520
on my end then.

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:11.600
All right, so you mentioned you agree

02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:15.520
in terms of consciousness on a lot of things with Anika.

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:20.280
Is there somebody friend or friendly foe

02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:25.280
that you disagree with in some nuanced, interesting way

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:28.640
or some major way about consciousness,

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:33.640
about these topics of reality that you return to often?

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:40.280
It's like Christopher Hitchens with the rabbi David Wolpe

02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:44.040
have had interesting conversations through years

02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:46.280
that added to the complexity

02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:47.640
and the beauty of their friendship.

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:51.920
Is there somebody like that that over the years

02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:54.520
has been a source of disagreement with you

02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:56.200
that strengthened your ideas?

02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:02.320
My ideas have been really shaped by several things.

02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.560
One is the physicalist framework

02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.440
that my scientific colleagues almost to a person

02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:12.800
have adopted and that I adopted too.

02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:18.520
The reason I walked away from it was because it became clear

02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:21.640
that we couldn't start with unconscious ingredients

02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:22.840
in Buddha of consciousness.

02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:27.840
Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist?

02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:33.120
So a physicalist, I would say as someone

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:35.920
who takes space-time and the objects within space-time

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:38.880
as ontologically fundamental.

02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:42.720
Right, and then reductionist is saying the smaller

02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:43.760
the more fundamental.

02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:45.800
That's a methodological thing.

02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:47.960
That's saying within space-time,

02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:50.520
as you go to smaller and smaller scales in space,

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:51.960
you get deeper and deeper laws,

02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:54.360
more and more fundamental laws.

02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:59.360
And the reduction of temperature to particle movement

02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:01.280
was an example of that.

02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:03.960
But I think that the reason that worked

02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:08.000
was almost an artifact of the nature of our interface.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.320
That was for a long time and your colleagues,

02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:12.080
including yourself, were physicalists

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:13.520
and now you broke away.

02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:15.680
Broke away because I think you can't start

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:18.480
with unconscious ingredients in Buddha of consciousness.

02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:21.240
And so even with Roger Penrose

02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.880
where there's like a gray area.

02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:26.880
Right, and here's the challenge I would put

02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:30.040
to all of my friends and colleagues

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:34.120
who give one specific conscious experience

02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:37.680
that you can boot up, right?

02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:40.720
So if you think that it's integrated information,

02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:44.160
and I've asked this of Giulio Tononi a couple of times

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:46.640
back in the 90s and then just a couple of years ago.

02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:49.040
I asked Giulio, okay, so great, integrated information.

02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:51.560
So we're all interested in explaining

02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:53.200
some specific conscious experiences.

02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:56.880
So what is, pick one, the taste of chocolate.

02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.680
What is the integrated information,

02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:02.600
precise structure that we need for chocolate

02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:05.840
and why does that structure have to be for chocolate

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:09.280
and why is it that it could not possibly be vanilla?

02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:12.560
I asked him, is there any one specific conscious experience

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:13.520
that you can account for?

02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:18.400
Because notice, they've set themselves the task

02:15:18.400 --> 02:15:21.480
of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems.

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:22.960
That's the task they've set themselves.

02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:25.520
But that doesn't mean they're,

02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:26.880
I understand your intuition,

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:28.320
but that doesn't mean they're wrong

02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:31.360
just because they can't find a way to boot it up yet.

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:32.200
That's right.

02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:33.040
No, that doesn't mean that they're wrong.

02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:37.400
It just means that they haven't done it.

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:38.960
I think it's principled.

02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:40.000
The reason is principled,

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.080
but I'm happy that they're exploring it.

02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:45.080
But the fact is, the remarkable fact is

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.280
there's not one theory.

02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:48.400
So integrated information theory,

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:51.440
orchestrated collapse of microtubules,

02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:54.800
global workspace theory.

02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:56.280
These are all theories of consciousness.

02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.720
These are all theories of consciousness.

02:15:57.720 --> 02:15:59.800
There's not a single theory

02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:02.720
that can give you a specific conscious experience

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:05.440
that they say, here is the physical dynamics

02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:06.680
or the physical structure

02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:08.040
that must be the taste of chocolate

02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:09.120
or whatever one they want.

02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:11.200
So you're saying it's impossible.

02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:13.040
They're saying it's just hard.

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:14.320
Yeah.

02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:18.200
My attitude is, okay, no one said

02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:19.640
you had to start with neurons

02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:21.200
or physical systems and boot up consciousness.

02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:22.040
You guys are just taking that.

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:23.520
You chose that problem.

02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:26.080
So since you chose that problem,

02:16:26.080 --> 02:16:27.320
how much progress have you made?

02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:30.040
Well, when you've not been able to come up

02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.000
with a single specific conscious experience,

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.520
and you've had these brilliant people

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:36.680
working on it for decades now,

02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:38.360
that's not really good progress.

02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:41.520
Let me ask you to play devil's advocate.

02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:44.160
Can you try to steel man,

02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:49.160
steel man meaning argue the best possible case for reality,

02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:51.200
the opposite of your book title.

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:54.360
So, or maybe just stick into consciousness.

02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:57.000
Can you take the physicalist view?

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.800
Can you steel man the physicalist view

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:01.760
for a brief moment playing devil's advocate too,

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:05.680
or steel man the person you used to be?

02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:06.520
Right, right.

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:07.360
She's a physicalist.

02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:11.440
What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong right now,

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:16.400
what would be a convincing argument for that?

02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:21.160
Well, I think the argument I would give

02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:23.840
and that I believed was, look,

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:25.880
when you have very simple physical systems,

02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:28.360
like a piece of dirt,

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:30.560
there's not much evidence of life for consciousness.

02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:31.960
It's only when you get really complicated

02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:34.560
physical systems like that of brains,

02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:36.400
and really the more complicated the brains,

02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:39.240
the more it looks like there's consciousness

02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:41.200
and the more complicated that consciousness is.

02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:45.240
Surely that means that simple physical systems

02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:49.000
don't create much consciousness, if maybe not any,

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
or maybe panpsychists,

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.320
they create the most elementary kinds

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:54.120
of simple conscious experiences.

02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:59.120
But you need more complicated physical systems to boot up,

02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:02.000
to create more complicated consciousnesses.

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:03.120
I think that's the intuition

02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:04.960
that drives most of my colleagues.

02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:09.040
And you're saying that this concept of complexity

02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.800
is ill-defined when you ground it to space-time.

02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:15.720
Well, I think it's well-defined

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:17.480
within the framework of space-time, right?

02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:21.120
No, it's ill-defined relative to what you need

02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.280
to actually understand consciousness,

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:26.320
because you're grounding complexity in space-time.

02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:28.240
Oh, got you, right, right.

02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:32.520
Yeah, what I'm saying is, if it were true

02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:35.600
that space-time was fundamental,

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:38.080
then I would have to agree

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:40.280
that if there is such a thing as consciousness,

02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:41.440
given the data that we've got,

02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:45.920
that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't,

02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:48.640
that somehow it's the complexity of the dynamics

02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:52.160
or organization, the function of the physical system

02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:55.120
that somehow is creating the consciousness.

02:18:55.120 --> 02:18:58.280
So under those assumptions, yes,

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:00.080
but when the physicists themselves are telling us

02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:03.720
that space-time is not fundamental, then I can understand.

02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:06.640
See, then the whole picture starts to come into focus.

02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:10.040
My colleagues are brilliant, right?

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.720
These are really smart people.

02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:14.120
Francis Crick worked on this

02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:15.880
for the last 20 years of his life.

02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:17.840
These are not stupid people.

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:19.720
These are brilliant, brilliant people.

02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:20.760
The fact that we've come up

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:23.040
with not a single specific conscious experience

02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:24.440
that we can explain.

02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:25.520
And no hope.

02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:27.520
There's no one that says, I'm really close.

02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:29.240
I'll have it for you in a year.

02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:33.320
No, there's just like, there's this fundamental gap.

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:36.400
So much so that Steve Pinker in one of his writings says,

02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:39.880
look, he likes the global workspace theory,

02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:41.560
but he says the last dollop of the theory

02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:44.080
in which there's something it's like to,

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:47.200
he said, we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact.

02:19:50.680 --> 02:19:52.080
Pinker is brilliant, right?

02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:54.960
He understands the state of play

02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:57.360
on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,

02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:00.880
starting with physicalist assumptions

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:02.640
and then trying to boot up consciousness.

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.480
When you've set yourself the problem,

02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:07.840
I'm starting with physical stuff that's not conscious.

02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:11.360
I'm trying to get the taste of chocolate out

02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:14.840
as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.040
We've not been able to do that.

02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:18.880
And so Pinker is saying, we may have to punt.

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:21.880
We may have to just stipulate that last bit.

02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:24.840
He calls it the last dollop and just say,

02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:27.080
stipulate it as a bare fact of nature

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.400
that there is something it's like.

02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:30.520
Well, from my point of view as the physical,

02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:33.000
the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:34.480
was we wouldn't have to stipulate.

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:36.440
I was gonna start with the physical stuff

02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:38.800
and explain where the consciousness came from.

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:40.680
If I'm going to stipulate consciousness,

02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:42.600
why don't I just stipulate consciousness

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:45.040
and not stipulate all the physical stuff too?

02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:46.840
So I'm stipulating less.

02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:48.680
I'm saying, okay, I agree.

02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:51.160
Well, it's actually what I call

02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:53.800
the conscious realist perspective.

02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:55.920
Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right?

02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:57.240
They're saying there's physical stuff

02:20:57.240 --> 02:21:00.080
that really is fundamental and then consciousness stuff.

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:01.280
So I would go with Pinker and say,

02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:04.120
look, let's just stipulate the consciousness stuff,

02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:05.960
but I'm not gonna stipulate the physical stuff.

02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:08.120
I'm gonna actually now show how to boot up

02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:11.160
the physical stuff from just the consciousness stuff.

02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:12.400
So I'll stipulate less.

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:15.200
Is it possible, so if you stipulate less,

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:20.200
is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality

02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:25.640
as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?

02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:27.960
Is it possible to visualize somehow?

02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:31.000
With the tools of math, with the tools of computers,

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.600
with the tools of our mind, are we hopelessly lost?

02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:37.680
You said there's ways to intuit

02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:44.320
what's true using mathematics and probability

02:21:44.720 --> 02:21:49.720
and sort of Markovian dynamics, all that kind of stuff,

02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:51.960
but that's not visualizing.

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:55.920
That's what's a kind of building intuition,

02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:58.520
but is it possible to visualize in the way we visualize

02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:02.360
so nicely in space-time in four dimensions,

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.280
in three dimensions, sorry.

02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:07.800
Well, we really are looking through a two-dimensional screen

02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:12.760
until it's what we intuit to be a three-dimensional world

02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:17.360
and also inferring dynamic stuff, making it 4D.

02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:20.560
Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:25.560
that give us a deeper sense of the truth of reality?

02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:29.680
I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.

02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:33.720
I think that, for example, the picture that we have

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:38.460
of electrons and photons interacting and scattering,

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:44.200
it may have not been possible until Faraday

02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:45.320
did all of his experiments

02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:47.320
and then Maxwell wrote down those equations

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:50.200
and we were then sort of forced by his equations

02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:51.980
to think in a new way.

02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:56.800
And then when Planck in 1900,

02:22:56.800 --> 02:23:00.940
desperate to try to solve the problem

02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:02.280
of black-body radiation,

02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:03.860
what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe,

02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:08.680
where Newton was predicting infinite energies,

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:11.500
there weren't infinite energies in black-body radiation.

02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:16.500
And he, in desperation, proposed packets of energy,

02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:22.680
and then once you've done that,

02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:25.280
and then you have an Einstein come along five years later

02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:29.360
and show how that explains the photoelectric effect.

02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:33.520
And then eventually in 1926, you get quantum theory.

02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.320
And then you get this whole new way of thinking

02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:38.380
that was, from the Newtonian point of view,

02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:43.380
completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly.

02:23:44.380 --> 02:23:47.660
And maybe if Gieson is right, not contradictory.

02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:49.860
Maybe if you use intuitionist math,

02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:50.700
they're not contradictory,

02:23:50.700 --> 02:23:54.420
but still certainly you wouldn't have gone there.

02:23:54.420 --> 02:23:57.740
And so here's a case where the experiments

02:23:57.740 --> 02:24:00.560
and then a desperate mathematical move,

02:24:01.740 --> 02:24:06.420
sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog.

02:24:06.420 --> 02:24:07.260
Right?

02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:12.260
And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.

02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:17.100
I wonder if it's still possible to visualize in the,

02:24:17.100 --> 02:24:20.140
like we talk about consciousness

02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:22.720
from a self-perspective experience it.

02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:25.740
Hold that idea in our mind,

02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:27.860
the way you can experience things directly.

02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:32.300
We've evolved to experience things in this 3D world.

02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:36.000
And that's a very rich experience.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.080
When you're thinking mathematically,

02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:42.420
you still, in the end of the day,

02:24:42.420 --> 02:24:47.420
you have to project it down to a low dimensional space

02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:49.700
to make conclusions.

02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:51.900
Their conclusions will be a number,

02:24:51.900 --> 02:24:56.060
or a line, or a plot, or a visual.

02:24:56.060 --> 02:25:00.620
So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth

02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:03.740
in a subjective way, like experience it,

02:25:03.740 --> 02:25:05.900
really feel the beauty of it, you know?

02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:08.540
In the way that humans feel beauty.

02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:09.380
Right.

02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:10.960
Are we screwed?

02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:11.860
I don't think we're screwed.

02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:14.420
I think that we get little hints of it

02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:17.540
from psychedelic drugs and so forth.

02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.700
We get hints that there are certain interventions

02:25:19.700 --> 02:25:21.420
that we can take on our interface.

02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:24.900
I apply this chemical, which is just some element

02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:29.740
of my interface, to this other, to a brain I ingested.

02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:31.500
And all of a sudden,

02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:33.460
I seem like I've opened new portals

02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:36.340
into conscious experiences.

02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.340
Well, that's very, very suggestive.

02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:40.980
That's like the black body radiation

02:25:40.980 --> 02:25:42.700
doing something that we didn't expect, right?

02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:44.060
It doesn't go to infinity

02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:45.420
when we thought it was gonna go to infinity,

02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:49.260
and we're forced to propose these quanta.

02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:52.240
So once we have a theory of conscious agents,

02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:55.220
and this projection is based on,

02:25:55.220 --> 02:25:58.100
I should sketch what I think that projection is.

02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:01.780
But then I think we can then start

02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:03.540
to ask specific questions.

02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:08.540
When you're taking DMT, or you're taking LSD,

02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:10.780
or something like that,

02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.980
now that we have this deep model,

02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:14.620
we've reverse engineered space and time

02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:16.180
and physical particles,

02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:18.580
we've pulled them back to this theory of conscious agents.

02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:22.040
Now we can ask ourselves, in this idealized future,

02:26:23.340 --> 02:26:25.140
what are we doing to conscious agents

02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:28.260
when we apply 5-MeO-DMT?

02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:29.860
What are we doing?

02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:32.280
Are we opening a new portal, right?

02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:33.740
So when I say that, I mean,

02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:35.940
I have a portal into consciousness

02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:39.220
that I call my body of Lex Fridman that I'm creating.

02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:41.860
And it's a genuine portal, not perfect,

02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:44.420
but it's a genuine portal I'm definitely communicating

02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:46.020
with your consciousness.

02:26:46.020 --> 02:26:49.300
And we know that we have one technology

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:51.420
for building new portals.

02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:53.820
We know one technology, and that is having kids.

02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:59.180
Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness.

02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:00.060
It takes a long time.

02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:01.340
Can you elaborate that?

02:27:01.340 --> 02:27:04.740
Oh, oh, oh, you mean like?

02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:07.180
Your son and your daughter didn't exist.

02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:08.260
That was a portal.

02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:10.420
You're having contact with consciousness

02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:12.340
that you never would have had before,

02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:14.700
but now you've got a son or a daughter.

02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:16.940
You went through this physical process.

02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:19.940
They were born, then there was all the training.

02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:22.780
But is that portal yours?

02:27:22.780 --> 02:27:25.300
So when you have kids, are you creating new portals

02:27:25.300 --> 02:27:27.300
that are completely distinct from the portals

02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:29.300
that you've created with other consciousness?

02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:31.300
Like, can you elaborate on that?

02:27:31.300 --> 02:27:34.500
To which degree are the consciousness of your kids

02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:36.460
a part of you?

02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:40.500
Well, so every person that I see,

02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:43.100
that symbol that I see, the body that I see,

02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:46.660
is a portal potentially for me to interact

02:27:46.660 --> 02:27:48.220
with a consciousness.

02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:49.060
Yeah.

02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:53.620
And each consciousness has a unique character.

02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:56.220
We call it a personality, and so forth.

02:27:56.220 --> 02:27:59.860
So with each new kid that's born,

02:27:59.860 --> 02:28:01.940
we come in contact with a personality

02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:03.700
that we've never seen before,

02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:05.700
and a version of consciousness

02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:06.940
that we've never seen before.

02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:08.620
At a deeper level, as I said,

02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:10.460
the theory says there's one agent.

02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:15.220
So this is a different projection of that one agent.

02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:18.860
But so that's what I mean by a portal is

02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:22.940
within my own interface, my own projection,

02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:26.140
can I see other projections

02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:29.740
of that one consciousness?

02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:31.980
So can I get portals in that sense?

02:28:31.980 --> 02:28:36.460
And I think we will get a theory of that,

02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:38.220
that we will get a theory of portals,

02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:41.500
and then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting.

02:28:41.500 --> 02:28:44.140
Are they actually creating new portals or not?

02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:47.980
If they're not, we should nevertheless then understand

02:28:47.980 --> 02:28:50.220
how we could create a new portal, right?

02:28:50.220 --> 02:28:51.420
Maybe we have to just study

02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:53.700
what happens when we have kids.

02:28:53.700 --> 02:28:57.380
We know that that technology creates new portals.

02:28:57.380 --> 02:28:59.420
So we have to reverse engineer that and then say,

02:28:59.420 --> 02:29:01.380
okay, could we somehow

02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:06.340
create new portals de novo?

02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:10.860
With something like brain-computer interfaces,

02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:11.700
for example.

02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:12.540
Yeah, or maybe just a chemical or something.

02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:14.580
It's probably more complicated than a chemical.

02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:16.260
That's why I think that the psychedelics,

02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:17.620
the psychedelics may,

02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:19.580
because they might be affecting this portal

02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:22.860
in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up.

02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:24.580
In other words, maybe once we understand

02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:27.380
what this thing is a portal, your body is a portal,

02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:28.620
and understand all of its complexities,

02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:31.500
maybe we'll realize that that portal can be shifted

02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:34.340
to different parts of the deeper consciousness

02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:36.420
and give new windows on it.

02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:38.860
And so in that way, maybe, yes,

02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:41.180
psychedelics could open up new portals

02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:42.300
in the sense that they're taking something

02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:45.980
that's already a complex portal and just tweaking it a bit.

02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:48.620
Well, but creating is a very powerful difference

02:29:48.620 --> 02:29:50.500
between morphing.

02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:52.900
Right, tweaking versus creating, I agree.

02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:57.900
But maybe it gives you intuition to at least the full space

02:29:57.940 --> 02:29:58.860
of the kinds of things

02:29:58.860 --> 02:30:01.100
that this particular system is capable of.

02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:05.140
I mean, the idea that consciousness creates brains,

02:30:05.140 --> 02:30:07.500
I mean, that breaks my brain,

02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:12.500
because I guess I'm still a physicalist in that sense,

02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:17.860
because it's just much easier to intuit the world.

02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:22.900
It's very, it's practical to think there's a neural network

02:30:22.900 --> 02:30:26.660
and what are the different ways fascinating

02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:32.300
capabilities can emerge from this neural network.

02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:34.380
I agree, it's easier.

02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:36.420
And so you start to,

02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:38.540
and then present to yourself the problem of,

02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:40.820
okay, well, how does consciousness arise?

02:30:40.820 --> 02:30:42.900
How does intelligence arise?

02:30:42.900 --> 02:30:46.540
How does emotion arise?

02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:49.780
How does memory arise in the,

02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:52.540
how do we filter within the system

02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:54.980
all the incoming sensory information

02:30:54.980 --> 02:30:57.660
and we're able to allocate attention

02:30:57.660 --> 02:30:58.780
in different interesting ways?

02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:00.740
How do all those mechanisms arise?

02:31:02.060 --> 02:31:04.140
To say that there's other fundamental things

02:31:04.140 --> 02:31:06.580
we don't understand outside of space-time

02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:10.060
that are actually core to how this whole thing works

02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:14.100
is a bit paralyzing, because it's like,

02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:19.100
oh, we're not 10% done, we're like 0.001% done.

02:31:20.660 --> 02:31:23.060
It's the immediate feeling.

02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:24.420
I certainly understand that.

02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:26.180
My attitude about it is,

02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:29.820
if you look at the young physicists

02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:32.620
who are searching for these structures beyond space-time,

02:31:32.620 --> 02:31:34.500
like Apple's Decade and so forth,

02:31:36.340 --> 02:31:37.420
they're having a ball.

02:31:38.380 --> 02:31:41.380
Space-time, that's what the old folks did.

02:31:41.380 --> 02:31:44.020
That's what the older generation did.

02:31:44.020 --> 02:31:48.580
We're doing something that really is fun and new

02:31:48.580 --> 02:31:51.980
and they're having a blast

02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:53.820
and they're finding all these new structures.

02:31:53.820 --> 02:31:56.820
So I think that we're going to

02:31:59.060 --> 02:32:03.540
succeed in getting a new deeper theory.

02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:04.540
I can just say what I'm hoping

02:32:04.540 --> 02:32:06.540
with the theory that I'm working on.

02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:09.060
I'm hoping to show that I could have

02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:12.740
this timeless dynamics of consciousness, no entropic time.

02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:16.220
I take a projection and I show how this timeless dynamics

02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:17.660
looks like the Big Bang

02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:21.860
and the entire evolution of space-time,

02:32:22.700 --> 02:32:25.140
in other words, I see how my whole space-time interface.

02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:29.780
So not just the projection doesn't just look like space-time,

02:32:29.780 --> 02:32:32.660
you can explain with it the whole,

02:32:32.660 --> 02:32:34.460
from the origin of the universe.

02:32:34.460 --> 02:32:35.740
That's what we have to do

02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:37.060
and that's what the physicists understand.

02:32:37.060 --> 02:32:39.260
When they go beyond space-time to the amplitude heater

02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:40.980
and the cosmological polytope,

02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:43.180
they ultimately know that they have to get back

02:32:43.180 --> 02:32:46.580
the Big Bang story and the whole evolution,

02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:49.380
that whole story where there were no living things.

02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:53.660
There was just a point and then the explosion

02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:55.620
and then just particles at high energy

02:32:55.620 --> 02:32:57.020
and then eventually the cooling down

02:32:57.020 --> 02:33:01.780
and the differentiation and finally matter condenses

02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:03.540
and then life and then consciousness.

02:33:03.540 --> 02:33:05.780
That whole story has to come out of something

02:33:05.780 --> 02:33:07.860
that's deeper and without time.

02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:09.700
And that's what we're up to.

02:33:09.700 --> 02:33:12.020
That's, we want to get that.

02:33:12.020 --> 02:33:14.460
So the whole story that we've been telling ourselves

02:33:14.460 --> 02:33:17.140
about Big Bang and how brains evolve in consciousness

02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:18.700
will come out of a much deeper theory.

02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:23.380
And for someone like me, it's a lot.

02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:26.140
I mean, but for the younger generation,

02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:30.780
this is like, oh wow, all the low cherries aren't picked.

02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:31.900
This is really good stuff.

02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:35.380
This is really new fundamental stuff that we can do.

02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:40.100
So I can't wait to read the papers of the younger generation

02:33:40.100 --> 02:33:41.940
and I want to see them.

02:33:42.940 --> 02:33:47.940
Ah, kids these days with their non-space time assumptions.

02:33:48.980 --> 02:33:51.660
It's just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition

02:33:51.660 --> 02:33:53.780
of those difficult ideas you struggle with.

02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:57.660
If you look like somebody like Emmanuel Kant,

02:33:57.660 --> 02:34:00.300
what are some interesting agreements and disagreements

02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:04.900
you have with a guy about the nature of reality?

02:34:04.900 --> 02:34:06.860
So there's a lot in agreement, right?

02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:10.980
So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist

02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:15.580
and he basically had the idea that

02:34:18.180 --> 02:34:19.380
we don't see nature as it is.

02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:21.180
We impose a structure on nature.

02:34:26.020 --> 02:34:29.100
And so in some sense, I'm saying something similar.

02:34:29.100 --> 02:34:31.700
I'm saying that, by the way, I don't call myself an idealist.

02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:33.540
I call myself a conscious realist

02:34:33.540 --> 02:34:35.660
because idealism has a long history.

02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:38.460
A lot of different ideas come under idealism

02:34:38.460 --> 02:34:40.340
and there's a lot of debates and so forth.

02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:44.540
It tends to be identified with, in many cases,

02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:46.660
anti-science and anti-realism.

02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:49.380
And I don't want either connection with my ideas

02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:51.540
and so I just called my conscious realism

02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:55.460
with an emphasis on realism and not anti-realism.

02:34:56.460 --> 02:34:59.620
But one place where I would, of course, disagree with Kant

02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:04.620
was that he thought that Euclidean space time was a priori.

02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:07.220
We just know that that's false.

02:35:08.060 --> 02:35:11.740
So he went too far on that.

02:35:11.740 --> 02:35:16.180
But in general, the idea that we don't start with space time,

02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:17.700
that space and time is in some sense

02:35:17.700 --> 02:35:19.220
the forms of our perceptions.

02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:20.380
Yes, absolutely.

02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:25.620
And I would say that there's a lot in common

02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:27.260
with Berkeley in that regard.

02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:31.700
There's a lot of ingenious arguments in Berkeley.

02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:36.700
Leibniz in his monodology understood very clearly

02:35:36.980 --> 02:35:39.140
that the hard problem was not solvable.

02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:42.180
He posed the hard problem and basically dismissed it.

02:35:42.180 --> 02:35:43.980
He just said, you can't do this.

02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:47.340
And so if he came here and saw where we are,

02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:50.340
he said, look, guys, I told you this 300 years ago.

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:51.580
And he had his monodology.

02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:54.180
He was trying to do something like,

02:35:56.300 --> 02:35:57.220
it's different from what I'm doing,

02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:59.820
but he had these things that were not in space and time,

02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:00.660
these monads.

02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:02.260
He was trying to build something.

02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:05.580
I'm trying to build a theory of conscious agents.

02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:08.500
My guess is that if he came here,

02:36:08.500 --> 02:36:10.540
I could just, if he saw what I was doing,

02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:13.140
he would say, he would understand it

02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:15.300
and immediately take off with it

02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:17.100
and go places that I couldn't.

02:36:17.100 --> 02:36:18.460
He would have no problems.

02:36:18.460 --> 02:36:21.420
So there would be, right, there would be overlap

02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:25.500
of the spirit of the ideas would be totally overlapping.

02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:26.900
But his genius would then just run with it

02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:28.100
far faster than I could.

02:36:28.100 --> 02:36:29.860
I love the humility here.

02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:32.660
So let me ask you about sort of practical implications

02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:36.500
of your ideas to our world, our complicated world.

02:36:36.500 --> 02:36:38.820
When you look at the big questions of humanity,

02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:43.820
of hate, war, what else is there?

02:36:46.860 --> 02:36:51.540
Evil, maybe there's the positive aspects of that,

02:36:51.540 --> 02:36:53.380
of meaning, of love.

02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:59.140
What is the fact that reality is an illusion?

02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:04.980
Perceived, what is the conscious realism

02:37:05.540 --> 02:37:07.500
when applied to daily life?

02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.300
What kind of impact does it have?

02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:12.300
A lot, and it's sort of scary.

02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:17.260
We all know that life is ephemeral

02:37:18.300 --> 02:37:20.300
and spiritual traditions have said,

02:37:20.300 --> 02:37:21.780
wake up to the fact that, you know,

02:37:21.780 --> 02:37:24.500
anything that you do here is going to disappear.

02:37:24.500 --> 02:37:27.940
But it's even more ephemeral than perhaps we've thought.

02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:30.900
I see this bottle because I create it right now.

02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:33.660
As soon as I look away,

02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:36.060
that data structure has been garbage collected.

02:37:36.060 --> 02:37:38.860
That bottle, I have to recreate it every time I look.

02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:41.260
So I spend all my money and I buy this fancy car.

02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:44.380
That car, I have to keep recreating it

02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:45.220
every time I look at it.

02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:46.540
It's that ephemeral.

02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:50.180
So all the things that we invest ourselves in,

02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:52.300
we fight over, we kill each other over,

02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:55.820
and we have wars over, these are all,

02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:59.420
it's like people in a virtual reality simulation, right?

02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:03.780
And there's this Porsche, and we all see the Porsche.

02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:07.060
Well, that Porsche exists when I look at it.

02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:09.060
I turn my headset and I look at it.

02:38:09.060 --> 02:38:12.180
And then if Joe turns his headset in the right way,

02:38:12.180 --> 02:38:13.260
he'll see his Porsche.

02:38:13.260 --> 02:38:15.220
It's not even the same Porsche that I see.

02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:16.660
He's creating his own Porsche.

02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:20.420
So these things are exceedingly ephemeral.

02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:25.420
And now, just imagine saying that that's my Porsche

02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:29.340
well, you can agree to say that it's your Porsche,

02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:32.860
but really the Porsche only exists as long as you look.

02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:34.580
So this all of a sudden,

02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:36.580
what the spiritual traditions have been saying

02:38:36.580 --> 02:38:38.180
for a long, long time,

02:38:38.180 --> 02:38:41.340
this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science.

02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:43.900
It's saying ephemeral, yes, in fact,

02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:45.860
it lasts for a few milliseconds,

02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:47.460
a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it,

02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:48.700
and then it's gone.

02:38:48.700 --> 02:38:53.700
So the whole idea, why are we fighting?

02:38:54.220 --> 02:38:55.060
Why do we hate?

02:38:56.060 --> 02:38:59.780
It's, we fight over possessions

02:39:01.620 --> 02:39:05.140
because we think that we're small little objects

02:39:05.140 --> 02:39:07.780
inside this preexisting space time.

02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:11.180
We assume that that mansion and that car

02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:12.940
exists independent of us.

02:39:12.940 --> 02:39:16.020
And that somehow we, these little things

02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:19.980
can have our sense of self and importance enhanced

02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:21.780
by having that special car or that special house

02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:23.660
or that special person.

02:39:24.580 --> 02:39:26.980
In fact, it's just the opposite.

02:39:26.980 --> 02:39:29.540
You create that mansion every time you look.

02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:32.980
That's, you're something far deeper than that mansion.

02:39:32.980 --> 02:39:37.140
You're the entity which can create that mansion on the fly.

02:39:37.140 --> 02:39:39.860
And there's nothing to the mansion

02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:41.660
except what you create in this moment.

02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:45.620
So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view,

02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:49.540
it has all sorts of implications

02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:51.620
for how we interact with each other,

02:39:51.620 --> 02:39:53.380
how we treat each other.

02:39:57.300 --> 02:39:58.740
And again, a lot of things

02:39:58.740 --> 02:40:02.500
that spiritual traditions have said, it's a mixed bag.

02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:03.740
Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag.

02:40:03.740 --> 02:40:05.100
So let me just be right in front about that.

02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:06.780
I'm not promoting any particular,

02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:08.380
but they do have some insights.

02:40:08.380 --> 02:40:09.540
Yeah, they have wisdom.

02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:10.460
They have certain wisdom.

02:40:10.460 --> 02:40:12.820
They have, I can point to nonsense, I won't go into it,

02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:14.500
but I can also point to lots of nonsense.

02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:19.340
So the issue is to then to look for the key insights.

02:40:19.540 --> 02:40:21.580
I think they have a lot of insights

02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:25.540
about the ephemeral nature of objects in space and time

02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:28.780
and not being attached to them, including our own bodies

02:40:28.780 --> 02:40:31.660
and reversing that I'm not this little thing,

02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:33.660
a little consciousness trapped in the body.

02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:36.060
And the consciousness itself is only a product of the body.

02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:39.100
So when the body dies, the consciousness disappears.

02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:40.660
It turns completely around.

02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:42.340
The consciousness is fundamental.

02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:46.380
The body, my hand exists right now

02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:47.900
because I'm looking at it.

02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:48.780
My hand is gone.

02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:50.660
I have no hand.

02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:52.100
I have no brain.

02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:53.180
I have no heart.

02:40:53.180 --> 02:40:55.380
If you looked, you'll see a heart.

02:40:55.380 --> 02:41:00.060
Whatever I am is this really complicated thing

02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:01.220
in consciousness.

02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:02.380
That's what I am.

02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:05.620
All the stuff that I thought I was

02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:07.540
is something that I create on the fly and delete.

02:41:07.540 --> 02:41:11.900
So this is completely a radical restructuring

02:41:11.900 --> 02:41:16.900
of how we think about possessions, about identity,

02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:20.420
about survival of death and so forth.

02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:22.740
This is completely transformative.

02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:24.860
But the nice thing is that this whole approach

02:41:24.860 --> 02:41:27.660
of conscious agents, unlike the spiritual traditions,

02:41:27.660 --> 02:41:30.660
which have said, in some cases, similar things,

02:41:30.660 --> 02:41:34.900
they've said it in precisely, this is mathematics.

02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:38.260
We can actually now begin to state precisely,

02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:40.180
here's the mathematical model of consciousness,

02:41:40.180 --> 02:41:42.420
conscious agents, here's how it maps onto space time,

02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:44.620
which I should sketch really briefly.

02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:50.380
And here's why things are ephemeral.

02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:52.700
And here's why you shouldn't be worried

02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:54.060
about the ephemeral nature of things,

02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:57.340
because you're not a little tiny entity

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:59.220
inside space and time.

02:41:59.220 --> 02:42:02.260
Quite the opposite, you're the author of space and time.

02:42:02.260 --> 02:42:06.180
The I and the am and the I am is all kind of emergent

02:42:06.180 --> 02:42:09.060
through this whole process of evolution and so on.

02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:13.740
That's just surface waves and there's a much deeper ocean

02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:15.300
that we're trying to figure out here.

02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:18.220
So how does, you said some of the stuff

02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:19.860
you're thinking about maps the space time,

02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:21.180
how does it map the space time?

02:42:21.180 --> 02:42:25.220
So just a very, very high level, and I'll keep it brief.

02:42:25.220 --> 02:42:28.180
The structures that the physicists are finding,

02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:31.100
like the amplituhedron, it turns out

02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:34.340
they're just static structure, they're polytopes.

02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:37.940
But they, remarkably, most of the information in them

02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:40.460
is contained in permutation matrices.

02:42:41.300 --> 02:42:43.900
So it's a matrix, like an end-by-end matrix

02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:45.380
that just has zeros and ones.

02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:50.180
That contains almost all of the information.

02:42:50.180 --> 02:42:52.900
And you can, they have these plavic graphs and so forth

02:42:52.900 --> 02:42:54.980
that they use to boot up the scattering.

02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:56.980
You can compute those scattering amplitudes

02:42:56.980 --> 02:43:00.380
almost entirely from these permutation matrices.

02:43:01.860 --> 02:43:05.260
So that's just, now from my point of view,

02:43:05.260 --> 02:43:07.540
I have this conscious agent dynamics.

02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:09.660
It turns out that the state of the matrix

02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:12.020
turns out that the stationary dynamics

02:43:12.020 --> 02:43:15.900
that I was talking about, where the entropy is increasing,

02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:19.700
all the stationary dynamics are sketched out

02:43:19.700 --> 02:43:22.420
by permutation matrices.

02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:27.700
So there's so-called Birkhoff polytope.

02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:31.620
All the vertices of this polytope, all the points,

02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:33.260
are permutation matrices.

02:43:33.260 --> 02:43:37.460
All the internal points are Markovian kernels

02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:42.620
that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.

02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:44.300
I need to intuit a little better

02:43:44.300 --> 02:43:45.900
what the heck you're talking about,

02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:50.900
but so basically, there's some complicated thing going on

02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:54.580
with the network of conscious agents,

02:43:54.580 --> 02:43:56.580
and that's mappable to this,

02:43:56.580 --> 02:43:58.540
you're saying a two-dimensional matrix

02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:02.060
that scattering has to do with what?

02:44:02.060 --> 02:44:05.300
With our perception, like this photon stuff?

02:44:05.300 --> 02:44:06.500
I mean, I don't know if it's useful

02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:09.660
to sort of dig into detail.

02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:10.980
I'll do just the high-level thing.

02:44:10.980 --> 02:44:11.900
Yes.

02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:15.540
So the high-level is the long-term behavior

02:44:15.540 --> 02:44:17.020
of the conscious agent dynamics.

02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:17.940
So that's the projection.

02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:20.660
Just looking at the long-term behavior,

02:44:20.660 --> 02:44:23.820
I'm hoping will give rise to the amplituhedron.

02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:27.700
The amplituhedron then gives rise to spacetime.

02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:29.860
So then I can just use their link

02:44:29.860 --> 02:44:31.140
to go all the way from consciousness

02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:34.260
through its asymptotics to, through the amplituhedron

02:44:34.260 --> 02:44:37.140
into spacetime and get the map all the way

02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:37.980
into our interface.

02:44:37.980 --> 02:44:39.700
And that's why you mentioned the permutation matrix

02:44:39.700 --> 02:44:42.460
because it gives you a nice thing to try to generate.

02:44:42.460 --> 02:44:43.300
That's right.

02:44:43.300 --> 02:44:44.540
It's the connection with the amplituhedron.

02:44:44.540 --> 02:44:47.460
The permutation matrices are the core of the amplituhedron,

02:44:47.460 --> 02:44:49.140
and it turns out they're the core

02:44:49.140 --> 02:44:52.300
of the asymptotic description of the conscious agents.

02:44:52.300 --> 02:44:54.860
So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator,

02:44:54.860 --> 02:44:57.860
but I like, first of all, I like video games,

02:44:57.860 --> 02:45:01.180
and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.

02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:03.140
First of all, do you think of it as an interesting idea,

02:45:03.140 --> 02:45:06.420
this thought experiment that will live in a simulation?

02:45:06.420 --> 02:45:10.380
And in general, do you think will live in a simulation?

02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:14.340
So the Nick Bostrom's idea about the simulation

02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:17.900
is typically couched in a physicalist framework.

02:45:17.900 --> 02:45:18.820
Yes.

02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:21.020
So there is the bottom level.

02:45:21.020 --> 02:45:24.300
There's some programmer in a physical spacetime,

02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:25.780
and they have a computer that they've programmed

02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:29.740
really cleverly where they've created conscious entities.

02:45:30.620 --> 02:45:32.700
So you have the hard problem of consciousness, right?

02:45:32.740 --> 02:45:33.580
The standard hard problem.

02:45:33.580 --> 02:45:36.660
How could a computer simulation create a conscious,

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:39.100
which isn't explained by that simulation theory.

02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:41.700
But then the idea is that the next level,

02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:44.180
the entities that are from the,

02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:46.660
that are created in the first level simulation,

02:45:46.660 --> 02:45:48.100
then can write their own simulations,

02:45:48.100 --> 02:45:49.460
and you get this nesting.

02:45:50.420 --> 02:45:55.420
So the idea that this is a simulation is fine,

02:45:55.780 --> 02:45:58.620
but the idea that it starts with a physical space,

02:45:58.620 --> 02:46:00.180
I think, isn't fine.

02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:01.860
Well, there's different properties here.

02:46:02.140 --> 02:46:03.700
The partial rendering.

02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:07.180
I mean, to me, that's the interesting idea

02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:11.300
is not whether the entirety of the universe is simulated,

02:46:11.300 --> 02:46:15.300
but how efficiently can you create interfaces

02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:21.820
that are convincing to all other entities

02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:24.060
that can appreciate such interfaces?

02:46:24.060 --> 02:46:25.900
How little does it take?

02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:27.900
Because you said like partial rendering,

02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:31.780
or like temporal, ephemeral rendering of stuff.

02:46:32.620 --> 02:46:33.940
Only render the tree falling in the forest

02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:36.380
when there's somebody there to see it.

02:46:36.380 --> 02:46:38.300
It's interesting to think,

02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:39.820
how can you do that super efficiently

02:46:39.820 --> 02:46:41.420
without having to render everything?

02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:44.460
And that to me is one perspective on the simulation,

02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:46.740
just like it is with video games,

02:46:46.740 --> 02:46:48.260
where a video game doesn't have to render

02:46:48.260 --> 02:46:49.540
every single thing.

02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:52.340
It's just the thing that the observer is looking at.

02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:53.180
Right.

02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:55.620
There is actually, that's a very nice question.

02:46:55.620 --> 02:46:58.100
And there's whole groups of researchers

02:46:58.100 --> 02:47:00.700
that are actually studying in virtual reality,

02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:05.700
what is the sort of minimal requirements on the system?

02:47:06.100 --> 02:47:07.740
What, how does it have to operate

02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:09.820
to give you an immersion experience,

02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:12.620
to give you the feeling that you have a body,

02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:14.260
to get you to take it real.

02:47:14.260 --> 02:47:15.980
And there's actually a lot of really good work

02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:16.820
on that right now.

02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:18.180
And it turns out it doesn't take that much.

02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:21.580
You do need to get the perception action loop tight,

02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:25.100
and you have to give them the perceptions

02:47:25.100 --> 02:47:26.940
that they're expecting, if you want them to.

02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:30.060
But if you can lead them along,

02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:31.140
if you give them perceptions

02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:32.300
that are close to what they're expecting,

02:47:32.300 --> 02:47:35.460
you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.

02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:36.940
Yeah, it's a tricky engineering problem,

02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:39.340
especially when you're trying to create a product

02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:42.980
that costs little, but it feels like an engineering problem,

02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:44.540
not a deep scientific problem.

02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:47.660
Or meaning, obviously it's a scientific problem,

02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:49.060
but as a scientific problem,

02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:53.300
it's not that difficult to trick us descendants of apes.

02:47:53.300 --> 02:47:56.420
But here's a case for just us in our own,

02:47:56.420 --> 02:47:58.540
if this is a virtual reality that we're experiencing right now.

02:47:58.540 --> 02:48:01.660
So here's something you can try for yourself.

02:48:01.660 --> 02:48:03.020
If you just close your eyes

02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:08.740
and look at your experience in front of you,

02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:09.900
be aware of your experience in front of you,

02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:14.020
what you experience is just like a model dark gray,

02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:15.140
where there's all sort of,

02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:17.620
there's some dynamics to it, but it's just dark gray.

02:48:17.620 --> 02:48:21.740
But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward,

02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:24.300
put your attention backward.

02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:26.860
What is it like behind you with your eyes closed?

02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:32.300
And there, it's like nothing.

02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:37.620
So what is going on here?

02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:41.300
What am I experiencing back there?

02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:44.660
Right?

02:48:44.660 --> 02:48:46.860
Well, I don't know if it's nothing.

02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:49.540
It's like, I guess it's the absence of,

02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:51.780
it's not even like darkness or something.

02:48:51.780 --> 02:48:53.300
It's not even darkness.

02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:57.620
There's no qualia to it.

02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:01.180
And yet there is a sense of being.

02:49:01.180 --> 02:49:02.140
And that's the interesting thing.

02:49:02.140 --> 02:49:03.620
There's a sense of being back.

02:49:03.620 --> 02:49:06.780
So I close my, I put my attention forward,

02:49:06.780 --> 02:49:08.940
I have the qualia of a gray model thing.

02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:10.420
But when I put my attention backward,

02:49:10.420 --> 02:49:13.460
there's no qualia at all, but there is a sense of being.

02:49:13.460 --> 02:49:14.420
Yeah.

02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:18.580
I personally, now you haven't been to that side of the room.

02:49:18.580 --> 02:49:20.060
I have been to that side of the room.

02:49:20.060 --> 02:49:22.460
So for me, memories, I start,

02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:27.220
I start playing the engine of memory replay.

02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:31.340
Which is like, I take myself back in time

02:49:31.340 --> 02:49:33.420
and think about that place where I was

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:34.540
hanging out in that part.

02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:35.740
That's what I see when I'm behind.

02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:38.700
So that's an interesting quirk of humans too,

02:49:38.700 --> 02:49:41.180
we're able to, we're collecting these experiences

02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:43.060
and we can replay them in interesting ways

02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:44.300
whenever we feel like it.

02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:46.620
And it's almost like being there,

02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:49.140
but not really, but almost.

02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:50.500
That's right.

02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:53.180
And yet we can go our entire lives in this.

02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:54.740
You're talking about the minimal thing for VR.

02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:56.980
We can go our entire lives and not realize that

02:49:56.980 --> 02:50:01.220
all of my life, it's been like nothing behind me.

02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:06.300
We're not even aware that all of our lives,

02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:09.420
if you just pay attention,

02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:10.700
pay attention to what's behind me,

02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:12.100
we're like, oh, holy smoke.

02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:13.300
It's sort of scary.

02:50:13.300 --> 02:50:14.780
I mean, it's like nothing.

02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:16.140
There's no qualia there at all.

02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:18.380
How did I not notice that my entire life?

02:50:18.380 --> 02:50:21.340
We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much.

02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:22.180
Yeah.

02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:25.340
I mean, you could see this with children, right?

02:50:25.340 --> 02:50:28.460
With persistence, you know, you could do the peek-a-boo game.

02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:32.140
You can hide from them and appear and they're fully tricked.

02:50:32.140 --> 02:50:34.860
And in the same way, we're fully tricked.

02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:37.900
There's nothing behind us and we assume there is.

02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:39.380
That's really interesting.

02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:41.340
These theories are pretty heavy.

02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:46.700
You as a human being, as a mortal human being,

02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:49.940
how has these theories been to you personally?

02:50:49.940 --> 02:50:51.780
Like are there good days and bad days

02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:54.140
when you wake up and look in the mirror

02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:57.780
and the fact that you can't see anything behind you,

02:50:57.780 --> 02:50:58.820
the fact that it's rendered?

02:50:58.820 --> 02:51:01.380
Like, is there interesting quirks?

02:51:01.380 --> 02:51:03.620
You know, Nietzsche with his,

02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:06.860
if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.

02:51:08.100 --> 02:51:12.020
How has these theories, these ideas changed you as a person?

02:51:13.340 --> 02:51:15.420
It's been very, very difficult.

02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:19.740
This stuff is not just abstract theory building

02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:21.740
because it's about us.

02:51:21.740 --> 02:51:23.860
Sometimes I've realized that there's this big division of me.

02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:26.540
My mind is doing all this science

02:51:26.540 --> 02:51:28.460
and coming up with these conclusions.

02:51:28.460 --> 02:51:30.020
And the rest of me is not integrating it.

02:51:30.020 --> 02:51:31.540
It's just like, I don't believe it.

02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:33.580
I just don't believe this, it seems.

02:51:33.580 --> 02:51:35.900
So as I start to take it seriously,

02:51:35.900 --> 02:51:36.980
I get scared myself.

02:51:36.980 --> 02:51:40.980
It's like, but it's very much,

02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:42.980
then I read these spiritual traditions

02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:45.060
and realize they're saying very, very similar things.

02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:48.180
It's like, there's a lot of convergence.

02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:51.340
So for me, I have,

02:51:52.300 --> 02:51:55.300
the first time I thought it might be possible

02:51:55.300 --> 02:51:59.500
that we're not seeing the truth was in 1986.

02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:02.140
It was from some mathematics we were doing.

02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:04.060
And when that hit me,

02:52:04.060 --> 02:52:06.180
it hit me like a ton of bricks, I had to sit down.

02:52:06.180 --> 02:52:10.780
It was, it really, it was scary.

02:52:10.780 --> 02:52:13.580
It was really a shock to the system.

02:52:13.580 --> 02:52:16.180
And then to realize that everything

02:52:16.180 --> 02:52:19.940
that has been important to me, like, you know,

02:52:20.420 --> 02:52:23.700
getting a house, getting a car,

02:52:23.700 --> 02:52:25.460
getting a reputation and so forth.

02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:28.820
Well, that car is just like the car I see

02:52:28.820 --> 02:52:29.660
in the virtual reality.

02:52:29.660 --> 02:52:32.660
It's there when you perceive it and it's not there.

02:52:32.660 --> 02:52:35.300
So the whole question of, you know,

02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:36.580
what am I doing and why?

02:52:36.580 --> 02:52:39.500
What's worthwhile doing in life?

02:52:40.380 --> 02:52:45.180
Clearly, getting a big house and getting a big car.

02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:48.180
I mean, we all knew that we were gonna die.

02:52:48.180 --> 02:52:50.500
So we tend not to know that.

02:52:50.500 --> 02:52:52.700
We tend to hide it, especially when we're young.

02:52:52.700 --> 02:52:54.700
Before age 30, we don't believe we're gonna die.

02:52:54.700 --> 02:52:56.900
Yeah, we factually maybe know

02:52:56.900 --> 02:52:59.460
that you kind of are supposed to, yeah.

02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:00.820
But they'll figure something out

02:53:00.820 --> 02:53:02.180
and we'll believe the generation

02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:04.300
that is the first one that doesn't have to die.

02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:05.140
That's the kind of thing.

02:53:05.140 --> 02:53:09.420
But when you really face the fact that you're going to die,

02:53:11.460 --> 02:53:12.740
and then when I start to look at it

02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:13.820
from this point of view that, well,

02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:16.460
this thing was an interface to begin with.

02:53:16.460 --> 02:53:20.180
So what I'm really, is what I'm really gonna be doing,

02:53:20.180 --> 02:53:21.620
just taking off a headset.

02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:24.180
So I've been playing in a virtual reality game all day

02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:25.860
and I got lost in the game

02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:27.700
when I was fighting over a Porsche.

02:53:27.700 --> 02:53:31.460
And I shot some guys up and I punctured their tires

02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:32.980
and I got the Porsche.

02:53:32.980 --> 02:53:35.140
Now I take the headset off and what was that for?

02:53:35.140 --> 02:53:36.140
Nothing.

02:53:36.140 --> 02:53:37.700
It was just, it was a data structure

02:53:37.700 --> 02:53:39.100
and the data structure is gone.

02:53:39.100 --> 02:53:42.980
So all of the wars, the fighting and the reputations

02:53:42.980 --> 02:53:46.940
and all this stuff, you know, where it's just a headset.

02:53:48.100 --> 02:53:52.500
So now, and so my theory says that intellectually,

02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:57.500
my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.

02:53:58.940 --> 02:54:03.460
This is like, you know, and so I have to meditate a lot.

02:54:03.460 --> 02:54:06.300
What percent of the day would you say you spend

02:54:06.300 --> 02:54:11.060
as a physicalist sort of living life,

02:54:11.060 --> 02:54:15.860
pretending your car matters, your reputation matter?

02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:19.660
Like how much, what's that Tom Waits song?

02:54:19.660 --> 02:54:22.500
I like my town with a little drop of poison.

02:54:22.500 --> 02:54:25.780
How much poison do you allow yourself to have?

02:54:25.780 --> 02:54:27.820
I think my default mode is physicalist.

02:54:27.820 --> 02:54:29.580
I think that that's just the default.

02:54:30.820 --> 02:54:35.820
When I'm not being conscious, consciously attentive.

02:54:37.260 --> 02:54:39.020
Intellectually consciously attentive.

02:54:39.020 --> 02:54:40.860
Because if you're just, you're still,

02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:44.140
if you're tasting coffee and not thinking or drinking

02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:47.460
or just taking in the sunset, you're not being intellectual

02:54:47.460 --> 02:54:49.500
but you're still experiencing it.

02:54:49.500 --> 02:54:53.700
So it's when you turn on the like the introspective machine,

02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:55.020
that's when you can start.

02:54:55.020 --> 02:54:56.860
And turn off the thinker.

02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:59.900
When I actually just start looking without thinking.

02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:03.860
So that's when I feel like I,

02:55:03.860 --> 02:55:06.860
all of a sudden I'm starting to see through.

02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:11.860
Sort of like, okay, part of the addiction to the interface

02:55:13.300 --> 02:55:14.780
is all the stories I'm telling about it.

02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:15.940
It's really important for me to get that,

02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:18.060
really important to do that.

02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:21.780
So I'm telling all these stories and so I'm all wrapped up.

02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:24.420
Almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head

02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:28.740
is about attachment to the interface.

02:55:28.740 --> 02:55:33.740
And so what I found is that the,

02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:38.780
essentially the only way to really detach from the interface

02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:43.780
is to literally let go of thoughts altogether.

02:55:44.380 --> 02:55:49.180
And then all of a sudden, even my identity,

02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:53.140
my whole history, my name, my education, all this stuff

02:55:53.140 --> 02:55:55.620
is almost irrelevant because it's just,

02:55:55.620 --> 02:55:59.500
now here is the present moment.

02:56:00.500 --> 02:56:03.740
And this is the reality right now.

02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:07.060
And all of that other stuff is an interface story.

02:56:07.060 --> 02:56:09.420
But this conscious experience right now,

02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:14.140
this is the only reality as far as I can tell.

02:56:14.140 --> 02:56:15.940
The rest of it's a story.

02:56:15.940 --> 02:56:20.500
And, but that is again, not my default.

02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:25.220
That is, I have to make a really conscious choice

02:56:25.220 --> 02:56:28.300
to say, okay, I know intellectually

02:56:28.380 --> 02:56:30.820
this is all an interface.

02:56:30.820 --> 02:56:33.580
I'm gonna take the headset off and so forth.

02:56:33.580 --> 02:56:36.540
And then immediately sink back into the game

02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:39.780
and just be out there playing the game and get lost in it.

02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:41.540
So I'm always lost in the game

02:56:41.540 --> 02:56:46.540
unless I literally consciously choose to stop thinking.

02:56:47.940 --> 02:56:50.820
Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge

02:56:50.820 --> 02:56:55.820
that to look beyond the game, isn't it?

02:56:56.260 --> 02:56:57.700
Isn't it?

02:56:57.700 --> 02:56:58.940
Scares the hell out of me.

02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:03.420
It really is scary because I'm so attached.

02:57:03.420 --> 02:57:04.500
I'm attached to this body.

02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:05.620
I'm attached to the interface.

02:57:05.620 --> 02:57:09.860
Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit?

02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:14.860
Meaning like, it's, I mean, some of these ideas,

02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:18.940
when you think about reality, even with like Einstein,

02:57:20.140 --> 02:57:22.420
just realizing, you said interface,

02:57:22.420 --> 02:57:25.100
just realizing that light,

02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:28.140
that there's a speed of light

02:57:28.140 --> 02:57:29.900
and you can't go fast in the speed of light.

02:57:29.900 --> 02:57:32.140
And like, what kind of things black holes

02:57:32.140 --> 02:57:34.660
and can do with light.

02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:37.100
Even that can mess with your head.

02:57:37.100 --> 02:57:38.140
Yes.

02:57:38.140 --> 02:57:41.060
But that's still space time.

02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:42.780
That's a big mess, but it's still just space time.

02:57:42.780 --> 02:57:44.740
It's still a property of our interface.

02:57:44.740 --> 02:57:45.580
That's right.

02:57:45.580 --> 02:57:49.940
But it's still like, even Einstein realized

02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:51.500
that this particular thing,

02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:52.980
some of the stories you tell ourselves

02:57:52.980 --> 02:57:56.020
is constructing interfaces

02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:59.500
that are oversimplifying the way things work.

02:58:00.380 --> 02:58:01.620
Because it's nice.

02:58:01.620 --> 02:58:03.620
The stories are nice.

02:58:03.620 --> 02:58:04.460
Stories are nice.

02:58:04.460 --> 02:58:06.380
I mean, it's just like video games.

02:58:06.380 --> 02:58:07.860
They're nice.

02:58:07.860 --> 02:58:08.700
Right.

02:58:08.700 --> 02:58:10.180
But Einstein was a realist, right?

02:58:10.180 --> 02:58:12.140
He was a famous realist in the sense

02:58:12.140 --> 02:58:15.140
that he was very explicit in a 1935 paper

02:58:15.140 --> 02:58:18.140
with Podolsky and Rosen, the EPR paper, right?

02:58:18.140 --> 02:58:23.140
They said, if without in any way disturbing a system,

02:58:26.140 --> 02:58:28.660
I can predict with probability one,

02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:30.060
the outcome of a measurement,

02:58:30.980 --> 02:58:35.980
then there exists in reality that element, right?

02:58:35.980 --> 02:58:37.620
That value.

02:58:37.620 --> 02:58:41.020
And we now know from quantum theory that that's false.

02:58:41.860 --> 02:58:44.460
That Einstein's idea of local realism

02:58:44.460 --> 02:58:47.340
is strictly speaking false.

02:58:47.340 --> 02:58:48.100
Yeah.

02:58:48.100 --> 02:58:50.940
And so we can predict, we can set up,

02:58:50.940 --> 02:58:52.940
in quantum theory, you can set up,

02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:56.540
and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum Bayesianism,

02:58:56.540 --> 02:58:58.540
where he scouts this out.

02:58:58.540 --> 02:58:59.460
It was done by other people,

02:58:59.460 --> 02:59:01.460
but he gives a good presentation of this,

02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:02.980
where they have a sequence of something

02:59:02.980 --> 02:59:06.300
like nine different quantum measurements that you can make.

02:59:06.300 --> 02:59:08.820
And you can predict with probability one

02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:10.620
what a particular outcome will be,

02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:15.460
but you can actually prove that it's impossible

02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:18.780
that the value existed before you made the measurement.

02:59:18.780 --> 02:59:20.820
So you know with probability one what you're gonna get,

02:59:20.820 --> 02:59:23.020
but you also know with certainty

02:59:23.020 --> 02:59:25.860
that that value was not there until you made the measurement.

02:59:25.860 --> 02:59:28.020
So we know from quantum theory

02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:31.660
that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

02:59:33.220 --> 02:59:35.740
And that is built into what I'm saying

02:59:35.740 --> 02:59:37.260
with this theory of consciousness.

02:59:37.260 --> 02:59:39.500
If consciousness is fundamental,

02:59:39.500 --> 02:59:42.220
space time itself is an act of fact creation.

02:59:42.220 --> 02:59:44.820
It's an interface that we create, consciousness creates,

02:59:44.820 --> 02:59:46.020
plus all the objects in it.

02:59:46.020 --> 02:59:48.860
So local realism is not true.

02:59:50.260 --> 02:59:51.820
Quantum theory is established,

02:59:51.820 --> 02:59:54.580
also non-contextual realism is not true.

02:59:54.580 --> 02:59:57.180
And that fits in perfectly with this idea

02:59:57.180 --> 02:59:59.580
that consciousness is fundamental.

02:59:59.580 --> 03:00:01.820
These things are, these exist as data structures

03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:02.780
when we create them.

03:00:03.740 --> 03:00:06.700
As Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation

03:00:06.700 --> 03:00:08.740
is an act of fact creation.

03:00:08.740 --> 03:00:10.940
But I must say on a personal level,

03:00:11.900 --> 03:00:16.900
I'm having to spend, I spend a couple hours a day

03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:21.980
just sitting in meditation on this

03:00:21.980 --> 03:00:26.980
and facing the rebellion in me

03:00:26.980 --> 03:00:28.140
that goes to the core,

03:00:28.140 --> 03:00:29.900
it feels like it goes to the core of my being,

03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:31.460
rebellion against these ideas.

03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:33.100
So here it's very, very interesting

03:00:33.100 --> 03:00:34.380
for me to look at this because,

03:00:34.380 --> 03:00:36.820
so here I'm a scientist and I'm a person.

03:00:36.820 --> 03:00:38.620
The science is really clear.

03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:39.740
Local realism is false,

03:00:40.220 --> 03:00:42.180
non-contextual realism is false.

03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:43.020
Spacetime is doomed.

03:00:43.020 --> 03:00:44.500
It's very, very clear.

03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:45.940
It couldn't be clearer.

03:00:47.540 --> 03:00:50.220
And my emotions rebel left and right.

03:00:50.220 --> 03:00:51.060
When I sit there and say,

03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:53.820
okay, I am not something in space and time.

03:00:55.020 --> 03:00:57.700
Something inside of me says, you're crazy.

03:00:57.700 --> 03:00:58.540
Of course you are.

03:00:58.540 --> 03:01:00.100
And I'm completely attached to it.

03:01:00.100 --> 03:01:01.980
I'm completely attached to all this stuff.

03:01:01.980 --> 03:01:04.580
I'm attached to my body, I'm attached to the headset,

03:01:04.580 --> 03:01:07.540
I'm attached to my car, attached to people,

03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:08.780
I'm attached to all of it.

03:01:09.940 --> 03:01:12.780
And yet I know as an absolute fact,

03:01:12.780 --> 03:01:14.660
I'm gonna walk away from all of it.

03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:15.500
I'm gonna die.

03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:21.540
In fact, I almost died last year.

03:01:21.540 --> 03:01:22.860
COVID almost killed me.

03:01:24.500 --> 03:01:26.580
I sent a goodbye text to my wife.

03:01:26.580 --> 03:01:28.420
So I thought I was done.

03:01:28.420 --> 03:01:29.260
You really did.

03:01:29.260 --> 03:01:30.500
I sent her a goodbye.

03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:35.500
I was in the emergency room and it had attacked my heart

03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:39.300
and it had been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours.

03:01:40.580 --> 03:01:41.620
I couldn't last much longer.

03:01:41.620 --> 03:01:43.940
I knew they couldn't stop it.

03:01:43.940 --> 03:01:44.780
So-

03:01:44.780 --> 03:01:46.660
So that was it.

03:01:46.660 --> 03:01:47.500
So that was it.

03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:50.660
So I texted her goodbye from the emergency room.

03:01:50.660 --> 03:01:52.460
I love you, goodbye kind of thing.

03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:53.780
Yeah, right.

03:01:53.780 --> 03:01:55.020
Yeah, that was it.

03:01:55.020 --> 03:01:55.860
So-

03:01:55.860 --> 03:01:56.700
Were you afraid?

03:01:57.580 --> 03:01:59.340
Yeah, I was scared to hell out of you, right?

03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:02.820
But there was, you're just feeling so bad anyway

03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:05.700
that that's sort of what you're scared,

03:02:05.700 --> 03:02:07.820
but you're just feeling so bad that in some sense,

03:02:07.820 --> 03:02:09.460
you just want it to stop anyway.

03:02:11.100 --> 03:02:16.100
So I've been there and faced it just a year ago.

03:02:17.060 --> 03:02:19.060
How did that change you, by the way?

03:02:19.060 --> 03:02:22.820
Having this intellectual reality that's so challenging

03:02:22.820 --> 03:02:25.700
that you meditate on, it's just an interface.

03:02:25.700 --> 03:02:29.060
And one of the hardest things to come to terms with

03:02:29.060 --> 03:02:33.020
is that that means that it's gonna end.

03:02:35.540 --> 03:02:38.220
How did that change you having come so close to the reality

03:02:38.220 --> 03:02:40.020
of it's not just an intellectual reality,

03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:43.860
it's a reality of death.

03:02:43.860 --> 03:02:46.860
It's forced, I've meditated for 20 years now,

03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:50.460
and I would say averaging three or four hours a day.

03:02:53.020 --> 03:02:57.500
But it's put a new urgency,

03:02:57.500 --> 03:02:59.300
but urgency is not the right word

03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:04.300
because it's riveted my attention, I'll put it that way.

03:03:05.220 --> 03:03:09.660
It's really riveted my attention and I've really paid,

03:03:10.540 --> 03:03:12.060
I spent a lot more time looking at

03:03:12.060 --> 03:03:13.900
what spiritual traditions say.

03:03:15.940 --> 03:03:18.820
By the way, again, not taking it with the,

03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:21.460
take it all with a grain of salt.

03:03:21.460 --> 03:03:23.380
But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me

03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:24.340
to ignore it.

03:03:24.340 --> 03:03:28.860
So I try to listen to the best ideas

03:03:28.860 --> 03:03:32.180
and to sort out nonsense from,

03:03:32.180 --> 03:03:34.460
and it's just, we all have to do it for ourselves, right?

03:03:34.460 --> 03:03:35.500
It's not easy.

03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:38.260
So what makes sense, and I have the advantage

03:03:38.260 --> 03:03:40.740
of some science, so I can look at what science says

03:03:40.740 --> 03:03:43.020
and try to compare with spiritual tradition.

03:03:43.020 --> 03:03:44.860
I try to sort it out for myself.

03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:48.340
But then I also look and realize

03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:49.540
that there's another aspect to me

03:03:49.540 --> 03:03:51.420
which is this whole emotional aspect.

03:03:52.380 --> 03:03:55.220
The, I seem to be wired up

03:03:56.980 --> 03:04:01.620
as evolutionary psychology says I'm wired up, right?

03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:04.100
All these defensive mechanisms, you know,

03:04:04.100 --> 03:04:06.900
I'm inclined to lie if I need to.

03:04:06.900 --> 03:04:10.980
I'm inclined to be angry, to protect myself,

03:04:10.980 --> 03:04:13.140
to have an in-group and an out-group,

03:04:13.140 --> 03:04:17.700
to try to make my reputation as big as possible,

03:04:17.700 --> 03:04:19.460
to try to demean the out-group.

03:04:19.460 --> 03:04:22.020
There's all these things that evolutionary psychology

03:04:22.020 --> 03:04:26.260
is spot on, it's really brilliant about the human condition.

03:04:26.260 --> 03:04:30.540
And yet I think evolution, as I said, evolutionary theory,

03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:32.060
is a projection of a deeper theory

03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:33.820
where there may be no competition.

03:04:34.660 --> 03:04:38.580
So how, so I'm in this very interesting position

03:04:38.580 --> 03:04:41.860
where I feel like, okay, according to my own theory,

03:04:41.860 --> 03:04:43.020
I'm consciousness.

03:04:43.020 --> 03:04:46.340
And maybe this is what it means for consciousness

03:04:46.340 --> 03:04:47.300
to wake up.

03:04:47.300 --> 03:04:49.180
It's not easy.

03:04:49.180 --> 03:04:54.180
It's almost like I feel like I have real skin in the game.

03:04:54.740 --> 03:04:55.820
It really is scary.

03:04:55.820 --> 03:04:58.740
I really was scared when I was about to die.

03:04:58.740 --> 03:05:02.380
It really was hard to say goodbye to my wife.

03:05:02.380 --> 03:05:04.660
It really, it really pained.

03:05:04.660 --> 03:05:09.420
And to then look at that and then look at the fact

03:05:09.420 --> 03:05:11.580
that I'm gonna walk away from this anyway

03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:12.820
and it's just an interface.

03:05:12.820 --> 03:05:16.260
How do I, so it's trying to put all this stuff together

03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:19.340
and really grok it, so to speak,

03:05:19.340 --> 03:05:22.700
not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.

03:05:22.700 --> 03:05:26.660
Yeah, what are you afraid of, you silly evolved organism

03:05:26.660 --> 03:05:30.020
that's gotten way too attached to the interface?

03:05:30.020 --> 03:05:31.980
What are you really afraid of?

03:05:31.980 --> 03:05:32.820
That's right.

03:05:33.900 --> 03:05:34.900
Is there a-

03:05:34.900 --> 03:05:36.620
Very personal, you know, it's very, very personal.

03:05:36.620 --> 03:05:37.460
Yeah.

03:05:37.460 --> 03:05:38.940
Yeah.

03:05:38.940 --> 03:05:40.980
I mean, speaking of the text,

03:05:40.980 --> 03:05:43.940
what do you think is this whole love thing?

03:05:43.980 --> 03:05:48.980
What's the role of love in our human condition?

03:05:49.220 --> 03:05:51.060
This interface thing we have,

03:05:51.060 --> 03:05:54.660
is it somehow interweaved, interconnected with consciousness?

03:05:54.660 --> 03:05:56.540
This attachment we have to other humans

03:05:56.540 --> 03:05:58.500
and this deep, like some,

03:06:00.460 --> 03:06:02.940
there's some quality to it

03:06:02.940 --> 03:06:07.460
that seems very interesting, peculiar.

03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:11.220
Well, there are two levels I would think about that.

03:06:11.220 --> 03:06:12.900
There's love in the sexual sense

03:06:12.900 --> 03:06:15.380
and then there's love in the deeper sense.

03:06:15.380 --> 03:06:16.940
And in the sexual sense,

03:06:16.940 --> 03:06:20.020
we can give an evolutionary account of that and so forth.

03:06:20.020 --> 03:06:22.060
And I think that's pretty clear to people.

03:06:24.420 --> 03:06:29.180
In this deeper sense, right, so of course,

03:06:29.180 --> 03:06:32.300
I've married, I love my wife in a sexual sense,

03:06:32.300 --> 03:06:33.980
but there was a deeper sense as well.

03:06:33.980 --> 03:06:35.060
When I was saying goodbye to her,

03:06:35.060 --> 03:06:36.980
there was a deeper, much deeper love

03:06:36.980 --> 03:06:38.380
that was really at play there.

03:06:38.380 --> 03:06:42.060
That's one place where I think that the mixed bag

03:06:42.100 --> 03:06:44.100
from spiritual traditions has something right.

03:06:44.100 --> 03:06:46.260
When they say, you know, love your neighbor as yourself,

03:06:46.260 --> 03:06:49.460
that in some sense, love is fundamental.

03:06:49.460 --> 03:06:51.900
I think that they're onto something,

03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:53.900
something very, very deep and profound.

03:06:54.820 --> 03:06:57.460
And every once in a while,

03:06:57.460 --> 03:06:58.940
I can get a personal glimpse of that,

03:06:58.940 --> 03:07:03.780
especially when I'm in the space with no thought.

03:07:03.780 --> 03:07:05.980
Like when I can really let go of thoughts,

03:07:07.300 --> 03:07:10.260
I get little glimpses of a love

03:07:10.260 --> 03:07:12.500
in the sense that I'm not separate.

03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:16.540
It's a love in the sense that I'm not different from that.

03:07:16.540 --> 03:07:17.900
I, you know.

03:07:17.900 --> 03:07:18.740
Yeah.

03:07:18.740 --> 03:07:21.340
If you and I are separate, then I can fight you.

03:07:21.340 --> 03:07:25.220
But if you and I are the same, if there's a union there.

03:07:25.220 --> 03:07:26.780
The togetherness of it, yeah.

03:07:26.780 --> 03:07:28.660
What, who's God?

03:07:29.620 --> 03:07:32.940
All those gods, the stories that have been told

03:07:32.940 --> 03:07:34.380
throughout history, you said,

03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:36.740
through the spiritual traditions.

03:07:36.740 --> 03:07:37.900
What do you think that is?

03:07:37.900 --> 03:07:42.900
Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?

03:07:44.380 --> 03:07:48.820
Well, in many traditions, not all.

03:07:50.780 --> 03:07:53.780
The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister.

03:07:54.820 --> 03:07:57.940
We tend to think of God as a being.

03:08:00.060 --> 03:08:02.820
But I think that that's not right.

03:08:02.820 --> 03:08:06.900
I think the closest way to think about God is being, period.

03:08:06.900 --> 03:08:09.020
Not a being, but being,

03:08:09.020 --> 03:08:12.380
the very ground of being itself is God.

03:08:12.380 --> 03:08:16.380
I think that's the deep, and from my point of view,

03:08:16.380 --> 03:08:17.660
that's the ground of consciousness.

03:08:17.660 --> 03:08:22.500
So the ground of conscious being is what we might call God.

03:08:22.500 --> 03:08:25.260
But the word God has always been, you know,

03:08:25.260 --> 03:08:27.660
for example, you don't believe the same God as my God,

03:08:27.660 --> 03:08:30.500
so I'm going to fight you, or we'll have wars over,

03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:34.500
because the being, the specific being that you call God

03:08:34.500 --> 03:08:35.980
is different from the being that I call God,

03:08:35.980 --> 03:08:36.940
and so we fight.

03:08:36.940 --> 03:08:41.020
Whereas if it's not a being, but just being,

03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:42.980
and you and I share a being,

03:08:42.980 --> 03:08:45.100
then you and I are not separate,

03:08:45.100 --> 03:08:46.940
and there's no reason to fight.

03:08:46.940 --> 03:08:48.820
We're both part of that one being,

03:08:48.820 --> 03:08:52.060
and loving you is loving myself,

03:08:52.060 --> 03:08:54.100
because we're all part of that one being.

03:08:54.100 --> 03:08:57.340
The spiritual traditions that point to that,

03:08:57.340 --> 03:09:01.380
I think are pointing in a very interesting direction,

03:09:01.380 --> 03:09:04.780
and that does seem to match with the mathematics

03:09:04.780 --> 03:09:06.940
of the conscious agent stuff that I've been working on

03:09:06.940 --> 03:09:09.820
as well, that it really fits with that,

03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:11.580
although that wasn't my goal.

03:09:11.580 --> 03:09:13.620
Is there, you mentioned,

03:09:15.380 --> 03:09:19.540
you mentioned that the young physicists that you talk to,

03:09:19.540 --> 03:09:23.740
or whose work you follow have quite a lot of fun

03:09:23.740 --> 03:09:26.220
breaking with the traditions of the past,

03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:28.660
the assumptions of the past.

03:09:28.660 --> 03:09:31.180
What advice would you give to young people today,

03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:34.820
in high school, in college, not just physicists,

03:09:34.820 --> 03:09:39.620
but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of,

03:09:39.620 --> 03:09:42.340
how they can have a life they can be proud of,

03:09:42.340 --> 03:09:45.340
how to make their way in the world from the lessons,

03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:47.580
from the wins and the losses in your own life?

03:09:47.580 --> 03:09:50.900
What little insights could you pull out?

03:09:50.900 --> 03:09:54.660
I would say the universe is a lot more interesting

03:09:54.660 --> 03:09:56.580
than you might expect,

03:09:56.580 --> 03:09:59.740
and you are a lot more special and interesting

03:09:59.740 --> 03:10:00.780
than you might expect.

03:10:00.780 --> 03:10:04.660
You're just a little, tiny, irrelevant,

03:10:06.060 --> 03:10:09.500
100 pound, 200 pound person

03:10:09.500 --> 03:10:12.780
in a vast billions of light years across space.

03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:15.980
And that's not the case.

03:10:15.980 --> 03:10:19.500
You are, in some sense, the being that's creating that space

03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:21.620
all the time, every time you look.

03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:25.380
So, waking up to who you really are,

03:10:25.380 --> 03:10:26.700
outside of space and time,

03:10:28.020 --> 03:10:29.420
as the author of space and time,

03:10:29.420 --> 03:10:32.060
as the author of everything that you see.

03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:36.340
The author of space and time, sorry.

03:10:36.340 --> 03:10:38.300
You're the author of space and time, right?

03:10:38.300 --> 03:10:40.060
And I'm the author of space and time,

03:10:40.060 --> 03:10:42.660
and space and time is just one little data structure.

03:10:42.660 --> 03:10:43.740
Many other consciousnesses

03:10:43.740 --> 03:10:45.500
are creating other data structures.

03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:48.260
They're authors of various other things.

03:10:48.260 --> 03:10:52.780
So, realizing, and then realizing that I had this feeling

03:10:52.780 --> 03:10:55.660
that growing up, going and reading all these texts,

03:10:55.660 --> 03:10:57.220
but, oh man, it's all been done.

03:10:58.140 --> 03:11:00.580
Yeah, if I'd just been there 50 years ago,

03:11:00.580 --> 03:11:01.580
I could have discovered this stuff,

03:11:01.580 --> 03:11:03.820
but it's all in the textbooks now.

03:11:03.820 --> 03:11:05.940
Well, believe me,

03:11:05.940 --> 03:11:08.980
the textbooks are gonna look silly in 50 years,

03:11:08.980 --> 03:11:11.180
and it's your chance to write the new textbook.

03:11:11.180 --> 03:11:14.620
So, of course, study the current textbooks.

03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:15.940
You have to understand them.

03:11:15.940 --> 03:11:17.780
There's no way to progress

03:11:17.780 --> 03:11:20.780
until you understand what's been done.

03:11:20.780 --> 03:11:25.780
But then, the only limit is your imagination, frankly.

03:11:25.980 --> 03:11:26.820
That's the only limit.

03:11:26.820 --> 03:11:29.940
The greatest books, the greatest textbooks ever written

03:11:29.940 --> 03:11:31.900
on Earth are yet to be written.

03:11:31.900 --> 03:11:32.740
Exactly.

03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:36.900
What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:40.140
What's the meaning of life from your limited interface?

03:11:40.140 --> 03:11:42.340
Can you figure it all out?

03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:43.420
Like, why?

03:11:43.420 --> 03:11:45.780
So, you said the universe is kind of trying

03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:47.860
to figure itself out through us.

03:11:49.020 --> 03:11:50.340
Why?

03:11:50.340 --> 03:11:51.180
Why?

03:11:54.060 --> 03:11:55.420
Yeah, that's the closest I've come.

03:11:55.420 --> 03:11:57.660
So, I'll give you,

03:11:57.660 --> 03:12:00.420
so I will say that I don't know,

03:12:00.420 --> 03:12:02.740
but here's my guess, right?

03:12:02.740 --> 03:12:03.940
That's a good first sentence.

03:12:03.940 --> 03:12:05.260
That's a good starting point.

03:12:05.260 --> 03:12:08.660
And maybe that's gonna be a profound part

03:12:08.660 --> 03:12:10.860
of the final answer is to start with the I don't know.

03:12:10.860 --> 03:12:13.820
It's quite possible that that's really important

03:12:13.820 --> 03:12:15.260
to start with the I don't know.

03:12:15.260 --> 03:12:18.660
My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental

03:12:18.660 --> 03:12:23.020
and if Gödel's incompleteness theorem holds here,

03:12:23.060 --> 03:12:26.380
and there's infinite variety of structures

03:12:27.660 --> 03:12:30.020
for consciousness to some sense explore,

03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:37.140
that maybe that's what it's about.

03:12:37.140 --> 03:12:39.420
This is something that Anika and I talked about a little bit

03:12:39.420 --> 03:12:40.820
and she doesn't like this way of talking about it.

03:12:40.820 --> 03:12:42.700
And so I'm gonna have to talk with her some more

03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:43.940
about this way of talking.

03:12:43.940 --> 03:12:45.460
But right now I'll just put it this way

03:12:45.460 --> 03:12:46.500
and I'll have to talk with her more

03:12:46.500 --> 03:12:48.940
and see if I can say it more clearly.

03:12:48.940 --> 03:12:51.940
But the way I'm talking about it now is that

03:12:54.020 --> 03:12:57.820
there's a sense in which there's being

03:13:00.020 --> 03:13:02.420
and then there's the experiences or forms

03:13:02.420 --> 03:13:03.460
that come out of being.

03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:05.860
That's one deep, deep mystery.

03:13:08.420 --> 03:13:12.260
And the question that you asked, what's it all about?

03:13:12.260 --> 03:13:13.700
Somehow it's related to that.

03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:18.100
Why doesn't it just stay without any forms?

03:13:18.100 --> 03:13:21.140
Why do we have experiences?

03:13:21.420 --> 03:13:22.620
Why do we have experiences?

03:13:22.620 --> 03:13:26.740
Why not just have, when you close your eyes

03:13:26.740 --> 03:13:28.580
and you pay attention to what's behind you,

03:13:28.580 --> 03:13:30.980
there's nothing, but there's being.

03:13:33.820 --> 03:13:36.020
Why don't we just stop there?

03:13:36.020 --> 03:13:37.020
Why didn't we just stop there?

03:13:37.020 --> 03:13:39.420
Why did we create all tables and chairs

03:13:39.420 --> 03:13:41.740
and the sun and moon and people,

03:13:41.740 --> 03:13:43.860
all this really complicated stuff, why?

03:13:44.780 --> 03:13:49.420
And all I can guess right now,

03:13:49.460 --> 03:13:51.820
and I'll probably kick myself in a couple of years

03:13:51.820 --> 03:13:53.900
and say that was dumb, but all I can guess right now

03:13:53.900 --> 03:13:57.820
is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself

03:13:57.820 --> 03:13:59.020
by knowing what it's not.

03:13:59.940 --> 03:14:03.100
So here I am, I'm not this body.

03:14:03.100 --> 03:14:06.380
And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face

03:14:06.380 --> 03:14:10.860
when I sent a text goodbye, but then as soon as I'm better,

03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:13.940
it's sort of like, okay, I sort of don't wanna go there.

03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:18.260
So I am my body.

03:14:18.340 --> 03:14:20.420
I go back to the standard, I am my body

03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:22.380
and I want to get that car.

03:14:22.380 --> 03:14:24.820
And even though I was just about to die a year ago,

03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:26.820
so that comes rushing back.

03:14:26.820 --> 03:14:31.580
So consciousness immerses itself fully

03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:37.500
into a particular headset, gets lost in it,

03:14:38.940 --> 03:14:40.460
and then slowly wakes up.

03:14:40.460 --> 03:14:42.620
Just so it can escape, and that is the waking up,

03:14:42.620 --> 03:14:43.900
but it needs to have the negative.

03:14:43.900 --> 03:14:45.660
Needs to know what it's not.

03:14:45.660 --> 03:14:48.420
It needs to know what you are.

03:14:48.420 --> 03:14:50.300
You have to say, oh, I'm not that, I'm not that.

03:14:50.300 --> 03:14:53.300
That wasn't important, that wasn't important.

03:14:53.300 --> 03:14:54.380
That's really powerful.

03:14:54.380 --> 03:14:56.900
Don, let me just say that,

03:14:56.900 --> 03:15:00.500
because I've been a long-term fan of yours

03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:03.380
and we're supposed to have a conversation during this

03:15:03.380 --> 03:15:05.460
very difficult moment in your life.

03:15:05.460 --> 03:15:07.420
Let me just say, you're a truly special person

03:15:07.420 --> 03:15:11.380
and I, for one, I know there's a lot of others that agree.

03:15:11.380 --> 03:15:14.300
I'm glad that you're still here with us on this earth.

03:15:14.340 --> 03:15:15.820
If for a short time.

03:15:17.940 --> 03:15:22.340
So whatever the universe,

03:15:22.340 --> 03:15:24.540
whatever plan it has for you

03:15:24.540 --> 03:15:26.700
that brought you close to death

03:15:26.700 --> 03:15:28.700
to maybe enlighten you some kind of way,

03:15:30.020 --> 03:15:34.060
I think it has an interesting plan for you.

03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:36.020
You're one of the truly special humans

03:15:36.020 --> 03:15:37.500
and it's a huge honor that you would sit

03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:38.860
and talk with me today.

03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:39.700
Thank you so much.

03:15:39.700 --> 03:15:40.540
Thank you very much, Lex.

03:15:40.540 --> 03:15:42.820
I really appreciate that, thank you.

03:15:42.820 --> 03:15:44.260
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:15:44.260 --> 03:15:45.540
with Donald Hoffman.

03:15:45.540 --> 03:15:46.940

And now, let me leave you with some words

03:15:51.580 --> 03:15:53.100
from Albert Einstein,

03:15:53.100 --> 03:15:56.060
relevant to the ideas discussed in this conversation.

03:15:56.940 --> 03:16:01.260
Time and space are modes by which we think

03:16:01.260 --> 03:16:03.660
and not conditions in which we live.

03:16:04.860 --> 03:16:07.660
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

03:16:12.820 --> 03:16:13.660
Thank you.
