WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters

00:02.560 --> 00:04.200
and he was slowly moving around

00:04.200 --> 00:06.960
and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.

00:06.960 --> 00:07.920
It was all still keyboard.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.960
We didn't even have mice set up at that time,

00:10.960 --> 00:14.720
but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.800
The wall disappears in a little animation

00:16.800 --> 00:18.760
and there's a monster like right there.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.440
And he practically fell out of his chair.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.680
It was just like, ah, and games just didn't do that.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.800
You know, the games were the God's eye view.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.760
You were a little invested in your little guy.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.200
You can be like, you know, happy or sad when things happen,

00:32.200 --> 00:34.920
but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.360
You weren't inside the game.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.000
Something in the back of your brain,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.160
some reptile brain thing is just going,

00:40.160 --> 00:42.400
oh shit, something just happened.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.920
And that was one of those early points where it's like,

00:44.920 --> 00:47.240
yeah, this is gonna make a difference.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.000
This is going to be powerful and it's gonna matter.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.120
The following is a conversation with John Carmack,

00:55.120 --> 00:56.840
widely considered to be one

00:56.840 --> 00:59.560
of the greatest programmers ever.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.960
He was the co-founder of id Software

01:01.960 --> 01:03.880
and the lead programmer on several games

01:03.880 --> 01:07.440
that revolutionized the technology, the experience,

01:07.440 --> 01:09.800
and the role of gaming in our society,

01:09.800 --> 01:15.800
including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.960
He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR,

01:19.960 --> 01:23.040
helping to create portals into virtual worlds

01:23.040 --> 01:26.760
and to define the technological path to the metaverse

01:27.760 --> 01:30.600
and now he has been shifting some of his attention

01:30.600 --> 01:34.480
to the problem of artificial general intelligence.

01:34.480 --> 01:38.000
This was the longest conversation on this podcast

01:38.000 --> 01:40.600
at over five hours, and still,

01:40.600 --> 01:43.360
I could talk to John many, many more times,

01:43.360 --> 01:45.160
and we hope to do just that.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.320
This is the Lex treatment podcast.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.480
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:50.480 --> 01:51.800
in the description.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.960
And now, dear friends, here's John Carmack.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.040
What was the first program you've ever written?

02:00.040 --> 02:01.240
Do you remember?

02:01.240 --> 02:02.080
Yeah, I do.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.400
So I remember being in a radio shack,

02:04.400 --> 02:06.800
going up to the TRS-80 computers

02:06.800 --> 02:09.880
and learning just enough to be able to do

02:09.880 --> 02:12.720
10-print John Carmack.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.080
And it's kind of interesting how, of course,

02:15.960 --> 02:19.040
Carnegie and Ritchie kind of standardized Hello World

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
as the first thing that you do

02:20.040 --> 02:22.720
in every computer programming language, in every computer,

02:22.720 --> 02:26.480
but not having any interaction with the cultures of Unix

02:26.480 --> 02:28.200
or any other standardized things,

02:28.200 --> 02:29.840
it was just like, well, what am I gonna say?

02:29.840 --> 02:31.120
I'm gonna say my name.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.160
And then you learn how to do go to 10

02:33.160 --> 02:34.920
and have it scroll all off the screen.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.280
And that was definitely the first thing

02:37.280 --> 02:39.520
that I wound up doing on a computer.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.280
Can I ask you a programming advice?

02:41.280 --> 02:42.680
I was always told in the beginning

02:42.680 --> 02:44.360
that you're not allowed to use go-to statements.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.520
That's really bad programming.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.920
Is this correct or not?

02:46.920 --> 02:50.280
Jumping around code, can we look at the philosophy

02:50.280 --> 02:53.680
and the technical aspects of the go-to statement

02:53.680 --> 02:55.120
that seems so convenient,

02:55.120 --> 02:55.960
but is supposed to use that programming?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.280
Well, so certainly back in the day

02:57.280 --> 02:58.920
in basic programming languages,

02:58.920 --> 03:00.760
you didn't have proper loops.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.720
You didn't have for-whiles and repeats.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.880
That was the land of Pascal for people

03:04.880 --> 03:07.360
that kind of generally had access to it back then.

03:07.360 --> 03:10.360
So you had no choice but to use go-tos.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.440
And as you made what were big programs back then,

03:13.440 --> 03:15.560
which were 1,000 line basic program,

03:15.560 --> 03:16.720
is a really big program.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.960
They did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.360
You didn't have good editors or code exploration tools.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.160
So you would wind up fixing things in one place,

03:26.160 --> 03:27.120
add a little patch,

03:27.120 --> 03:29.680
and there's reasons why structured programming

03:29.680 --> 03:31.720
generally helps understanding.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.840
But go-tos aren't poisonous.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.920
Sometimes they're the right thing to do.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.840
Usually it's because there's a language feature missing,

03:38.840 --> 03:40.520
like nested breaks or something,

03:40.520 --> 03:44.560
where it can sometimes be better to do a go-to cleanup

03:44.560 --> 03:48.000
or go-to error rather than having multiple flags,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.440
multiple if statements littered throughout things.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.800
But it is rare.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.160
I mean, if you grep through all of my code right now,

03:55.160 --> 03:57.560
I don't think any of my current code bases

03:57.560 --> 03:58.960
would actually have a go-to,

03:58.960 --> 04:02.680
but deep within sort of the technical underpinnings

04:02.680 --> 04:03.720
of a major game engine,

04:03.720 --> 04:07.240
you're gonna have some go-tos in a couple of places probably.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.200
Yeah, the infrastructure on top of,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.280
like the closer you get to the machine code,

04:11.280 --> 04:12.720
the more go-tos you're gonna see,

04:12.720 --> 04:15.640
the more of these like hacks you're going to see,

04:15.640 --> 04:18.240
because the set of features available to you

04:18.240 --> 04:22.360
in low-level programming languages is limited.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.360
So, print John Carmack, when is the first time,

04:28.360 --> 04:30.000
if we could talk about love,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.680
that you fell in love with programming?

04:31.680 --> 04:34.640
You said like, this is really something special.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.040
It really was something

04:36.040 --> 04:38.120
that was one of those love at first sight things,

04:38.120 --> 04:39.920
where just really from the time

04:39.920 --> 04:42.000
that I understood what a computer was,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.440
even, I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias

04:45.440 --> 04:48.560
of the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes

04:48.560 --> 04:50.200
at the reel-to-reel tape decks,

04:50.200 --> 04:52.320
and for people nowadays,

04:52.320 --> 04:53.800
it can be a little hard to understand

04:53.800 --> 04:56.280
what the world was like then from information gathering,

04:56.280 --> 04:58.720
where I would go to the libraries,

04:58.720 --> 05:01.080
and there would be a couple books on the shelf

05:01.080 --> 05:03.880
about computers, and they would be very out of date,

05:03.880 --> 05:06.640
even at that point, just not a lot of information,

05:06.640 --> 05:09.160
but I would grab everything that I could find

05:09.160 --> 05:10.560
and devour everything.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.200
Whenever Time or Newsweek had some article about computers,

05:14.200 --> 05:17.640
I would cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.960
It felt like this magical thing to me,

05:19.960 --> 05:22.760
this idea that the computer would just do

05:22.760 --> 05:24.480
exactly what you told it to.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.400
I mean, and there's a little bit

05:25.400 --> 05:27.720
of the genie monkey's paw sort of issues there,

05:27.720 --> 05:29.760
where you'd better be really, really careful

05:29.760 --> 05:31.080
with what you're telling it to do,

05:31.080 --> 05:33.120
but it wasn't gonna backtalk you,

05:33.120 --> 05:34.760
it wasn't gonna have a different point of view,

05:34.760 --> 05:37.400
it was gonna carry out what you told it to do,

05:37.400 --> 05:39.840
and if you had the right commands,

05:39.840 --> 05:43.560
you could make it do these pretty magical things.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.000
And so what kind of programs did you write at first?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.280
So Beyond the Print, John Carmack.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.800
So I can remember as going through the learning process,

05:51.800 --> 05:53.720
where you find at the start,

05:53.720 --> 05:54.600
you're just learning how to do

05:54.600 --> 05:56.400
the most basic possible things,

05:56.400 --> 05:59.840
and I can remember stuff like a Superman comic

05:59.840 --> 06:02.640
that Radio Shack commissioned to have,

06:02.640 --> 06:04.840
it's like Superman had lost some of his super brain,

06:04.840 --> 06:07.520
and kids had to use Radio Shack TRS-80 computers

06:07.520 --> 06:11.960
to do calculations to help him complete his heroics,

06:11.960 --> 06:15.240
and I'd find little things like that,

06:15.240 --> 06:17.320
and then get a few basic books

06:17.320 --> 06:20.120
to be able to kind of work my way up,

06:20.120 --> 06:22.440
and again, it was so precious back then,

06:22.440 --> 06:24.560
I had a couple books that would teach me

06:24.560 --> 06:25.920
important things about it,

06:25.920 --> 06:28.640
I had one book that I could start to learn

06:28.640 --> 06:30.320
a little bit of assembly language from,

06:30.320 --> 06:32.000
and I'd have a few books on basic,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.560
and some things that I could get from the libraries,

06:34.560 --> 06:37.160
but my goals in the early days

06:37.160 --> 06:40.040
was almost always making games of various kinds,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.960
I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games,

06:44.960 --> 06:47.760
and being able to do some of those things myself

06:47.760 --> 06:51.400
on the computers was very much what I aspired to,

06:51.400 --> 06:52.400
and it was a whole journey,

06:52.400 --> 06:54.400
where if you learn normal basic,

06:54.400 --> 06:56.120
you can't do any kind of an action game,

06:56.120 --> 06:57.440
you can write an adventure game,

06:57.440 --> 06:59.200
you can write things where you say,

06:59.200 --> 07:02.440
what do you do here, get sword, attack troll,

07:02.440 --> 07:03.640
that type of thing,

07:03.640 --> 07:07.080
and that can be done in the context of basic,

07:07.080 --> 07:09.560
but to do things that had moving graphics,

07:09.560 --> 07:11.320
there were only the most limited things

07:11.320 --> 07:12.280
you could possibly do,

07:12.280 --> 07:14.960
you could maybe do breakout or pong or that sort of thing

07:14.960 --> 07:16.960
in low resolution graphics,

07:16.960 --> 07:20.760
and in fact, one of my first major technical hacks

07:20.760 --> 07:25.440
that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers,

07:25.440 --> 07:28.840
they had a mode called low resolution graphics,

07:28.840 --> 07:31.440
where of course all graphics were low resolution back then,

07:31.440 --> 07:34.120
but regular low resolution graphics,

07:34.120 --> 07:37.200
it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally,

07:37.200 --> 07:39.480
but they could have 16 different colors,

07:40.400 --> 07:42.120
and I wanted to make a game kind of like

07:42.120 --> 07:44.960
the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game,

07:44.960 --> 07:47.440
and I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up,

07:47.440 --> 07:49.280
and I could move a little ship around,

07:49.280 --> 07:50.800
you could manage to do that in basic,

07:50.800 --> 07:53.560
but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen,

07:53.560 --> 07:55.320
and I remember at the time,

07:55.320 --> 07:58.200
just coming up with what felt like a brainstorm to me,

07:58.200 --> 08:01.240
where I knew enough about the way the hardware

08:01.240 --> 08:03.440
was controlled, where the text screen

08:03.440 --> 08:05.160
and the low resolution graphics screen

08:05.160 --> 08:06.920
were basically the same thing,

08:06.920 --> 08:09.680
and all those computers could scroll their text screen

08:09.680 --> 08:11.040
reasonably, you could do a listing,

08:11.040 --> 08:12.720
and it would scroll things up,

08:12.720 --> 08:15.880
and I figured out that I could kind of tweak

08:15.880 --> 08:18.080
just a couple things that I barely understood,

08:18.080 --> 08:19.640
to put it into a graphics mode,

08:19.640 --> 08:20.880
and I could draw graphics,

08:20.880 --> 08:22.880
and then I could just do a line feed

08:22.880 --> 08:24.360
at the very bottom of the screen,

08:24.360 --> 08:26.280
and then the system would scroll it all up

08:26.280 --> 08:28.040
using an assembly language routine

08:28.040 --> 08:30.240
that I didn't know how to write back then,

08:30.240 --> 08:33.320
so that was like this first great hack

08:33.320 --> 08:36.040
that sort of had analogs later on in my career

08:36.040 --> 08:37.120
for a lot of different things,

08:37.120 --> 08:39.440
so I found out that I could draw a screen,

08:39.440 --> 08:40.880
I could do a line feed at the bottom,

08:40.880 --> 08:42.160
we would scroll it up once,

08:42.160 --> 08:44.600
I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom,

08:44.600 --> 08:47.840
and that was my first way to kind of scroll the screen,

08:47.840 --> 08:51.160
which was interesting in that that played a big part

08:51.160 --> 08:53.280
later on in the id software days as well.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.040
So do efficient drawing,

08:57.040 --> 08:59.200
where you don't have to draw the whole screen,

08:59.200 --> 09:01.920
but you draw from the bottom using the thing

09:01.920 --> 09:04.520
that was designed in the hardware for text output.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.960
Yeah, where so much of, until recently,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.240
game design was limited by

09:11.240 --> 09:13.200
what you could actually get the computer to do,

09:13.200 --> 09:14.800
where it's easy to say like,

09:14.800 --> 09:16.000
okay, I wanna scroll the screen,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.480
you just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset,

09:19.480 --> 09:21.600
and nowadays, that works just fine.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.760
Computers are ludicrously fast,

09:24.760 --> 09:27.880
but up until a decade ago or so,

09:27.880 --> 09:30.160
there were all these things everybody wanted to do,

09:30.160 --> 09:31.920
but if they knew enough programming

09:31.920 --> 09:33.520
to be able to make it happen,

09:33.520 --> 09:36.480
it would happen too slow to be a good experience,

09:36.480 --> 09:39.280
either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough

09:39.280 --> 09:42.040
that it wasn't fun to experience it like that.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.560
So, so much of kind of the first couple decades

09:44.560 --> 09:46.160
of the programming work that I did

09:46.160 --> 09:48.640
was largely figuring out how to do something

09:48.640 --> 09:51.440
that everybody knows how they want it to happen,

09:51.440 --> 09:54.240
it just has to happen two to 10 times faster

09:54.240 --> 09:56.280
than sort of the straightforward way

09:56.280 --> 09:58.600
of doing things would make it happen.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.840
And it's different now because at this point,

10:01.880 --> 10:03.240
lots of things you can just do

10:03.240 --> 10:05.000
in the most naive possible way,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.520
and it still works out.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.480
You don't have nearly the creative limitations

10:09.480 --> 10:12.560
or the incentives for optimizing on that level,

10:12.560 --> 10:14.440
and there's a lot of pros and cons to that,

10:14.440 --> 10:16.120
but I do generally,

10:16.120 --> 10:18.400
I'm not gonna do the angry old man

10:18.400 --> 10:20.000
shaking my fist at the clouds bit

10:20.000 --> 10:23.120
where back in my day, programmers had to do real programming.

10:23.120 --> 10:26.680
It's amazing that you can just kind of pick an idea

10:26.680 --> 10:27.880
and go do it right now,

10:27.880 --> 10:30.560
and you don't have to be some assembly language wizard

10:31.000 --> 10:33.880
or deep GPU arcanist to be able to figure out

10:33.880 --> 10:35.200
how to make your wishes happen.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.440
Well, there's still, see, that's true,

10:38.440 --> 10:41.200
but let me put on my old man with a fist hat

10:41.200 --> 10:45.240
and say that probably the thing that will define the future

10:45.240 --> 10:47.960
still requires you to operate

10:47.960 --> 10:49.680
at the limits of the current system.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.840
So we'll probably talk about this,

10:51.840 --> 10:54.280
but if you talk about building the metaverse

10:54.280 --> 10:57.160
and building a VR experience that's compelling,

10:57.160 --> 11:01.320
it probably requires you to not to go to assembly

11:01.320 --> 11:05.880
or maybe not literally, but sort of spiritually

11:05.880 --> 11:08.320
to go to the limits of what the system is capable of.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.840
Yeah, and that really was why virtual reality

11:10.840 --> 11:13.640
was specifically interesting to me,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.000
where it had all the ties to,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.120
you could say that even back in the early days,

11:17.120 --> 11:19.160
I have some old magazine articles

11:19.160 --> 11:22.160
that's talking about doom as a virtual reality experience

11:22.160 --> 11:25.200
back when just seeing anything in 3D.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.960
So you could say that we've been trying

11:26.960 --> 11:29.640
to build those virtual experiences from the very beginning.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.840
And in the modern era of virtual reality,

11:32.840 --> 11:34.800
especially on the mobile side of things,

11:34.800 --> 11:36.680
when it's standalone and you're basically using

11:36.680 --> 11:39.000
a cell phone chip to be able to produce

11:39.000 --> 11:41.800
these very immersive experiences,

11:41.800 --> 11:43.640
it does require work.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.720
It's not at the level of what an old school

11:45.720 --> 11:48.480
console game programmer would have operated at

11:48.480 --> 11:50.320
where you're looking at hardware registers

11:50.320 --> 11:53.520
and you're scheduling all the DMA accesses,

11:53.520 --> 11:55.520
but it is still definitely a different level

11:55.520 --> 11:57.480
than what a web developer

11:57.480 --> 12:01.760
or even a PC Steam game developer usually has to work at.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.840
And again, it's great.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.920
There's opportunities for people that wanna operate

12:04.920 --> 12:06.400
at either end of that spectrum there

12:06.400 --> 12:09.560
and still provide a lot of value to the world.

12:09.560 --> 12:14.560
Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.

12:15.560 --> 12:19.920
What would you say is the best programming language?

12:19.920 --> 12:22.560
Your favorite, but also the best.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.160
You've seen throughout your career,

12:25.160 --> 12:29.440
you're considered by many to be the greatest programmer ever.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.320
I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone,

12:32.320 --> 12:34.000
but if you put it on anyone, it's you.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.400
So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions

12:36.400 --> 12:38.760
of what's the best band of all time,

12:38.760 --> 12:41.520
but in your case, what's the best programming language?

12:41.520 --> 12:43.560
Everything has all the caveats about it.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.400
But so what I use, so nowadays,

12:46.400 --> 12:48.800
I do program a reasonable amount of Python

12:48.800 --> 12:51.960
for AI, ML sorts of work.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.440
I'm not a native Python programmer.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.000
It's something I came to very late in my career.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.800
I understand what it's good for.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.080
But you don't dream in Python.

13:00.080 --> 13:00.920
I do not.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.360
And it has some of those things

13:02.360 --> 13:04.800
where there's some amazing stats when you say,

13:04.800 --> 13:07.120
if you just start, if you make a loop,

13:07.120 --> 13:11.000
a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.840
you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower

13:14.840 --> 13:17.600
than a proper GPU tensor operation.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.800
And these are staggering numbers.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.840
You can be as much slower as we've almost gotten faster

13:22.840 --> 13:25.240
in our pace of progress

13:25.240 --> 13:26.960
and all this other miraculous stuff.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.840
So your intuitions about inefficiencies

13:28.840 --> 13:30.240
within the Python sort of-

13:30.240 --> 13:32.120
It keeps hitting me upside the face

13:32.120 --> 13:34.440
where it's gotten to the point now I understand it's like,

13:34.440 --> 13:35.880
okay, you just can't do a loop

13:35.880 --> 13:38.520
if you care about performance in Python.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.400
You have to figure out how you can reformat this

13:41.400 --> 13:43.120
into some big vector operation

13:43.120 --> 13:44.920
or something that's going to be done completely

13:44.920 --> 13:47.120
within a C++ library.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.920
But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient

13:49.920 --> 13:52.320
and you just see stuff that people are able

13:52.320 --> 13:53.680
to cobble together by,

13:53.680 --> 13:55.480
you just import a few different things

13:55.480 --> 13:58.040
and you can do stuff that nobody on earth could do

13:58.040 --> 13:58.880
10 years ago.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.520
And you can do it in a little cookbook thing

14:00.520 --> 14:02.840
that you copy pasted out of a website.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.800
So that is really great.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.960
When I'm sitting down to do what I consider

14:06.960 --> 14:10.440
kind of serious programming, it's still in C++.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.960
And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that

14:13.960 --> 14:17.160
where I'm not big into the modern template

14:17.160 --> 14:18.760
meta programming sorts of things.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.280
I see a lot of train wrecks coming from

14:21.280 --> 14:23.520
some of that over abstraction.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.800
I spent a few years really going kind of deep

14:26.800 --> 14:30.120
into the kind of the historical Lisp work

14:30.120 --> 14:32.320
and the Haskell and some of the functional programming

14:32.320 --> 14:33.360
sides of things.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.040
And there is a lot of value there

14:37.040 --> 14:38.680
in the way you think about things.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.160
And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code

14:42.160 --> 14:45.920
based on what I learned about the value that comes out

14:45.920 --> 14:48.120
of not having this random mutable state

14:48.120 --> 14:50.280
that you kind of lose track of.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.680
Because something that many people don't really appreciate

14:53.680 --> 14:55.520
till they've been at it for a long time

14:55.520 --> 14:58.280
is that it's not the writing of the program initially,

14:58.280 --> 15:00.480
it's the whole lifespan of the program.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.720
And that's when it's not necessarily just

15:02.720 --> 15:05.540
how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates,

15:05.540 --> 15:09.520
but it's how can it bend and adapt as situations change.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.200
And then the thing that I've really been learning

15:11.200 --> 15:14.760
in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work

15:14.760 --> 15:17.000
is it's also how well it hands off

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
between a continuous kind of revolving door of programmers

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
taking over maintenance and different things

15:22.000 --> 15:24.640
and how you get people up to speed in different areas.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.160
And there's all these other different aspects of it.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.000
So-

15:28.000 --> 15:32.560
C++ a good language for handover between engineers.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.840
Probably not the best.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.940
And there's some really interesting aspects to this

15:36.940 --> 15:39.400
where in some cases languages

15:39.400 --> 15:43.480
that are not generally thought well of for many reasons,

15:43.480 --> 15:46.400
like C is derided pretty broadly that yes,

15:46.400 --> 15:48.160
obviously all of these security flaws

15:48.160 --> 15:50.400
that happen with the memory and unsafeness

15:50.400 --> 15:53.920
and buffer overruns and the things that you've got there.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.680
But there is this underappreciated aspect

15:56.680 --> 15:59.560
to the language is so simple, anyone can go.

15:59.560 --> 16:03.080
And if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace

16:03.080 --> 16:06.160
and not have to learn what paradigms they're using

16:06.160 --> 16:08.360
because there just aren't that many available.

16:08.360 --> 16:12.480
I think there's some really, really well-written C code.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.520
Like I find it great that if I'm messing around

16:15.520 --> 16:17.120
with something in OpenBSD say,

16:17.120 --> 16:19.320
I mean, I can be walking around in the kernel

16:19.320 --> 16:22.160
and I'm like, I understand everything that's going on here.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.960
It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do

16:25.960 --> 16:29.760
to make whatever change that I need to.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.820
While you can have more significant languages

16:32.820 --> 16:34.800
like it's a downside of Lisp

16:34.800 --> 16:37.320
where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp.

16:37.320 --> 16:41.680
I think that it did help my thinking about programming

16:41.680 --> 16:44.920
in some ways, but the people that are the biggest defenders

16:44.920 --> 16:47.840
of Lisp are saying how malleable of a language it is

16:47.840 --> 16:50.080
that if you write a huge Lisp program,

16:50.080 --> 16:53.120
you've basically invented your own kind of language

16:53.120 --> 16:55.440
and structure because it's not the primitives

16:55.440 --> 16:57.000
of the language you're using very much.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.480
It's all of the things you've built on top of that.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.040
And then a language like Racket,

17:01.040 --> 17:03.380
kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions,

17:03.380 --> 17:05.340
it's essentially touted as a language

17:05.340 --> 17:07.040
for building other languages.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.080
And I understand the value of that

17:10.080 --> 17:12.440
for a tiny little project,

17:12.440 --> 17:15.360
but the idea of that for one of these long-term supported

17:15.360 --> 17:18.000
by lots of people kind of horrifies me

17:18.000 --> 17:20.480
where all of those abstractions that you're like,

17:20.480 --> 17:23.920
okay, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself

17:23.920 --> 17:26.760
on all of these things that we've built on top of that.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.440
And it was interesting to see how when Google made Go,

17:30.440 --> 17:33.360
a lot of the criticisms of that are it's like, wow,

17:33.360 --> 17:35.040
this is not a state of the art language.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.120
This language is just so simple and almost crude.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.520
And you could see the programming language people

17:40.520 --> 17:42.000
just looking down at it,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.160
but it does seem to be quite popular

17:44.160 --> 17:47.280
as basically saying this is the good things about C.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.400
Everybody can just jump right in and use it.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.080
You don't need to restructure your brain

17:52.080 --> 17:53.920
to write good code in it.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.340
So I wish that I had more opportunity

17:56.340 --> 17:59.040
for doing some work in Go.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.020
Rust is the other modern language

18:01.020 --> 18:04.040
that everybody talks about that I'm not fit to pass judgment

18:04.200 --> 18:06.600
on I've done a little bit beyond Hello World.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.940
I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust

18:09.940 --> 18:12.720
just as an exercise, but that was a few years ago

18:12.720 --> 18:15.040
and I haven't really used it since.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.160
The best programming language is the one that works

18:17.160 --> 18:19.160
generally that you're currently using

18:19.160 --> 18:22.280
because that's another trap is in almost every case

18:22.280 --> 18:25.000
I've seen when people mixed languages on a project,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.080
that's a mistake.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.000
I would rather stay just in one language

18:29.000 --> 18:31.680
so that everybody can work across the entire thing.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.400
I get meta, we have a lot of projects

18:34.400 --> 18:36.400
that use kind of React frameworks.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.920
So you've got JavaScript here

18:37.920 --> 18:40.960
and then you have C++ for real work

18:40.960 --> 18:42.720
and then you may have Java interfacing

18:42.720 --> 18:44.720
with some other part of the Android system.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.000
And those are all kind of horrible things.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
And that was one thing that I remember talking with Boz

18:52.520 --> 18:54.920
at Facebook about it where like, man,

18:54.920 --> 18:56.040
I wish we could have just said

18:56.040 --> 18:59.000
we're only hiring C++ programmers.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.680
And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective,

19:02.680 --> 19:05.400
well, we just wouldn't be able to find enough.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.040
With the thousands of programmers they've got there,

19:08.040 --> 19:10.800
it is not necessarily a dying breed,

19:10.800 --> 19:12.960
but you can sure find a lot more Java

19:12.960 --> 19:14.960
or JavaScript programmers.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.840
And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time

19:17.840 --> 19:21.120
and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.

19:21.120 --> 19:22.160
It's like, well, you just,

19:22.160 --> 19:23.960
you go out and you find those programmers

19:23.960 --> 19:25.520
and you don't hire the other programmers

19:25.520 --> 19:28.400
that don't do the languages that you wanna use.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.360
But right now, I guess, yeah,

19:29.360 --> 19:32.360
they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work

19:32.360 --> 19:33.760
for the UI side of things.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.400
When you go find UI programmers,

19:35.400 --> 19:36.920
they're JavaScript programmers.

19:36.920 --> 19:37.960
I wonder if that's because

19:37.960 --> 19:39.720
there's a lot of JavaScript programmers

19:39.720 --> 19:44.720
because I do think that great programmers are rare.

19:44.720 --> 19:48.360
That it's not, if you just look at statistics

19:48.360 --> 19:51.240
of how many people are using different programming languages,

19:51.240 --> 19:53.280
that doesn't tell you the story

19:53.280 --> 19:55.720
of what the great programmers are using.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.160
And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to,

19:59.160 --> 20:00.800
which is the fundamentals of a language.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.720
What does it encourage you?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.280
How does it encourage you to think?

20:03.280 --> 20:05.680
What kind of systems does it encourage you to build?

20:05.680 --> 20:07.880
There is something about C++

20:08.760 --> 20:11.240
that has elements of creativity,

20:11.240 --> 20:15.120
but forces you to be an adult about your programming.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.640
It expects you to be an adult.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.720
It does not force you to.

20:18.720 --> 20:23.280
And so it brings out people

20:23.280 --> 20:25.320
that are willing to be creative

20:25.320 --> 20:27.320
in terms of building large systems

20:27.320 --> 20:29.280
and coming up with interesting solutions,

20:29.280 --> 20:32.520
but at the same time have the sort of the

20:32.520 --> 20:35.560
good software engineering practices

20:35.560 --> 20:39.080
that amend themselves to real world systems.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.160
Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.

20:43.440 --> 20:48.040
So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years

20:48.040 --> 20:50.080
and humans are long gone,

20:50.080 --> 20:53.480
something tells me that most of the systems they find

20:53.480 --> 20:55.000
will be running JavaScript.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.600
I kind of think that if we're living in a simulation,

20:58.600 --> 21:00.000
it's written in JavaScript.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.520
You know, for the longest time, even still,

21:05.520 --> 21:08.120
JavaScript didn't get any respect

21:08.120 --> 21:10.000
and yet it runs so much of the world

21:10.000 --> 21:12.120
and an increasing number of the world.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.280
Is it possible that all,

21:14.280 --> 21:16.720
everything will be written in JavaScript one day?

21:16.720 --> 21:18.800
So the engineering under JavaScript

21:18.800 --> 21:21.280
is really pretty phenomenal.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.600
The systems that make JavaScript run as fast

21:24.600 --> 21:26.360
as it does right now

21:26.360 --> 21:29.960
are kind of miracles of modern engineering in many ways.

21:29.960 --> 21:34.440
It does feel like it is not an optimal language

21:34.440 --> 21:36.360
for all the things that it's being used for

21:36.360 --> 21:38.240
or an optimal distribution system

21:38.240 --> 21:41.880
to build huge apps in something like this

21:41.880 --> 21:44.120
without type systems and so on.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.520
But I think for a lot of people,

21:47.520 --> 21:50.440
it does reasonably the necessary things.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.280
It's still a C-flavored language.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.840
It's still a braces and semicolon language.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.480
It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript

21:59.480 --> 22:02.560
and then understand the roots of where it came from.

22:02.560 --> 22:07.120
I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing

22:07.120 --> 22:08.840
for most programs to be written in.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.000
It's funny that I still, just this morning,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.200
I was seeing a Twitter thread

22:13.200 --> 22:15.560
of a bunch of really senior game dev people

22:15.560 --> 22:18.880
arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.960
You will run into some people

22:19.960 --> 22:22.200
that are top-notch programmers that just say,

22:22.200 --> 22:24.680
no, this is literally not a good thing.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.800
Oh, because it makes you lazy?

22:25.800 --> 22:28.400
Yes, that it makes you not think about things.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.600
And I do disagree.

22:29.600 --> 22:33.280
I think that there is so much objective data

22:33.280 --> 22:35.640
on the vulnerabilities that have happened

22:35.640 --> 22:37.760
in C and C++ programs,

22:37.760 --> 22:40.080
sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.680
It's like nobody is good enough

22:41.680 --> 22:44.160
to avoid ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.520
You write enough C code,

22:45.520 --> 22:47.600
you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.000
And garbage collection is a very great thing

22:50.000 --> 22:51.720
for the vast majority of programs.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.720
It's only when you get into the tightest of real-time things

22:54.720 --> 22:56.240
that you start saying it's like,

22:56.240 --> 22:58.320
no, the garbage collection has more costs

22:58.320 --> 22:59.920
than it has benefits for me there.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.560
But that's not 99 plus percent

23:02.560 --> 23:04.840
of all the software in the world.

23:04.840 --> 23:09.360
So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways.

23:09.360 --> 23:14.120
And so much of programming is not the language itself.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.440
It's the infrastructure around every, you know,

23:16.480 --> 23:19.000
that surrounds it, all the libraries that you can get

23:19.000 --> 23:20.440
and the different stuff that you can,

23:20.440 --> 23:22.440
ways you can deploy it,

23:22.440 --> 23:24.160
the portability that it gives you.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.040
And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things

23:27.040 --> 23:31.080
where for a long time, and it still does if I look at it,

23:31.080 --> 23:34.000
the web stack about everything that has to go

23:34.000 --> 23:36.400
when you do something really trivial in JavaScript

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
and it shows up on a web browser

23:38.400 --> 23:40.320
to kind of X-ray through that

23:40.320 --> 23:42.200
and see everything that has to happen

23:42.200 --> 23:44.640
for your one little JavaScript statement

23:44.640 --> 23:48.240
to turn into something visible in your web browser.

23:48.240 --> 23:51.120
It's very, very disquieting,

23:51.120 --> 23:53.320
just the depth of that stack

23:53.320 --> 23:56.800
and the fact that so few people can even comprehend

23:56.800 --> 23:59.440
all of the levels that are going on there.

23:59.440 --> 24:02.280
But it's again, I have to caution myself

24:02.280 --> 24:05.520
to not be the in the good old days old man about it

24:05.520 --> 24:08.760
because clearly there's enormous value here.

24:08.760 --> 24:11.160
The world does run on JavaScript

24:11.160 --> 24:13.240
to a pretty good approximation there.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.720
And it's not falling apart.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.080
There's a bunch of scary stuff

24:16.080 --> 24:18.400
where you look at console logs

24:18.400 --> 24:20.920
and you just see all of these bad things that are happening,

24:20.920 --> 24:22.560
but it's still kind of limping along

24:22.560 --> 24:24.760
and nobody really notices.

24:24.760 --> 24:28.400
But so much of my systems design

24:28.400 --> 24:30.720
and systems analysis goes around,

24:30.720 --> 24:32.920
you should understand what the speed of light is,

24:32.920 --> 24:36.120
like what would be the best you could possibly do here.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.400
And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases,

24:39.400 --> 24:41.120
you can be a thousand times off

24:41.160 --> 24:43.960
your speed of light velocity for something

24:43.960 --> 24:45.560
and it's still be okay.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.400
And in fact, it can even sometimes still be

24:48.400 --> 24:51.160
the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint

24:51.160 --> 24:52.720
where there's a lot of things

24:52.720 --> 24:55.680
that you don't wanna have to parachute in someone like me

24:55.680 --> 25:00.680
to go in and say, make this webpage run a thousand times faster,

25:01.600 --> 25:05.360
make this web app into a hardcore native application

25:05.360 --> 25:08.080
that starts up in 37 milliseconds

25:08.080 --> 25:11.240
and everything responds in less than one frame latency,

25:11.240 --> 25:12.680
that's just not necessary.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.440
And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars

25:15.440 --> 25:16.720
to do software like that,

25:16.720 --> 25:19.040
when they can take somebody right out of a bootcamp

25:19.040 --> 25:21.960
and say, spin up an application for this,

25:21.960 --> 25:26.960
often being efficient is not really the best metric.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.280
And it's like, that applies in a lot of areas

25:29.280 --> 25:31.000
where it's kind of interesting

25:31.000 --> 25:33.320
how a lot of our appliances and everything

25:33.320 --> 25:36.360
are all built around energy efficiency,

25:36.360 --> 25:39.360
sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways

25:39.360 --> 25:41.120
or higher costs in other ways

25:41.120 --> 25:42.920
where there's interesting things

25:42.920 --> 25:46.040
where energy or electricity could become much cheaper

25:46.040 --> 25:47.000
in a future world

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
and that could change our engineering trade-offs

25:49.000 --> 25:50.480
for the way we build certain things

25:50.480 --> 25:53.040
where you could throw away efficiency

25:53.040 --> 25:56.240
and actually get more benefits that actually matter.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.280
I mean, that's one of my,

25:58.560 --> 26:00.920
one of the directions I was considering swerving into

26:00.920 --> 26:02.720
was nuclear energy.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.560
When I was kind of like, what do I wanna do next?

26:04.560 --> 26:08.080
It was either gonna be cost-effective nuclear fission

26:08.080 --> 26:10.480
or artificial general intelligence.

26:10.480 --> 26:14.600
And one of my pet ideas there is like,

26:14.600 --> 26:18.320
people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.320
And there would be ways that I,

26:21.320 --> 26:24.680
you could be a quarter the efficiency or less,

26:24.680 --> 26:27.640
but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper,

26:27.640 --> 26:31.160
that could be a radical innovation in something like that.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.480
So there's like some of these thoughts

26:32.480 --> 26:35.440
around like direct fission energy conversion,

26:35.440 --> 26:36.680
fission fragment conversion

26:36.680 --> 26:38.400
that maybe you build something

26:38.400 --> 26:40.840
that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything,

26:40.840 --> 26:42.640
even if it winds up being less efficient.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.000
So that applies a lot in programming

26:45.000 --> 26:49.120
where it's always good to know what you could do

26:49.120 --> 26:51.960
if you really sat down and took it far,

26:51.960 --> 26:53.680
because sometimes there's discontinuities

26:53.680 --> 26:56.040
like around user reaction times,

26:56.040 --> 26:58.040
there are some points where the difference

26:58.080 --> 27:02.880
between operating in one second and 750 milliseconds,

27:02.880 --> 27:03.880
not that huge.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.640
You'll see it in webpage statistics,

27:05.640 --> 27:08.240
but most of the usability stuff, not that great.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.000
But if you get down to 50 milliseconds,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.200
then all of a sudden this just feels amazing.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.440
It's just like doing your bidding instantly

27:15.440 --> 27:17.200
rather than you're giving it a command,

27:17.200 --> 27:19.720
twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.

27:19.720 --> 27:23.040
So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard

27:23.040 --> 27:25.000
to get over some threshold,

27:25.000 --> 27:28.880
but there are broad basins in the value metric

27:28.880 --> 27:31.240
for lots of work where it just doesn't pay

27:31.240 --> 27:32.960
to even go that extra mile.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.280
And there are craftsmen that just don't wanna buy that

27:36.280 --> 27:37.840
and more power to them.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.040
If somebody just wants to say,

27:39.040 --> 27:42.720
no, I'm going to be, my pride is in my work,

27:42.720 --> 27:44.040
I'm never going to do something

27:44.040 --> 27:46.360
that's not as good as I could possibly make it.

27:46.360 --> 27:50.080
I respect that and sometimes I am that person,

27:50.080 --> 27:53.800
but I try to focus more on the larger value picture

27:53.800 --> 27:55.240
and you do pick your battles

27:55.240 --> 27:57.360
and you deploy your resources in the play

27:57.360 --> 27:59.640
that's going to give you sort of the best user value

27:59.640 --> 28:00.680
in the end.

28:00.680 --> 28:04.640
Well, if you look at the evolution of life on earth

28:04.640 --> 28:08.640
as a kind of programming effort,

28:10.840 --> 28:13.320
it seems like efficiency isn't the thing

28:13.320 --> 28:15.160
that's being optimized for.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.200
Like natural selection is very inefficient,

28:17.200 --> 28:22.200
but it kind of adapts into the process of adaptations

28:22.480 --> 28:24.320
building more and more complex systems

28:24.320 --> 28:25.440
that are more and more intelligent.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.160
The final result is kind of pretty interesting.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.960
And so I think of JavaScript the same way.

28:30.960 --> 28:35.560
It's like this giant mess that things naturally die off

28:35.560 --> 28:39.440
if they don't work and if they become useful to people,

28:39.440 --> 28:40.920
they kind of naturally live

28:40.920 --> 28:42.880
and then you build this community,

28:42.880 --> 28:45.960
large community of people that are generating code

28:45.960 --> 28:48.160
and some code is sticky, some is not.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.680
And nobody knows the inefficiencies

28:52.480 --> 28:54.920
or the breaking points, like how reliable this code is

28:54.920 --> 28:57.800
and you kind of just run it, assume it works

28:57.800 --> 29:00.440
and then get unpleasantly surprised

29:00.440 --> 29:03.160
and then that's very kind of the evolutionary process.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.000
So that's a really good analogy

29:05.000 --> 29:06.840
and we can go a lot of places with that

29:06.840 --> 29:09.520
where in the earliest days of programming,

29:09.520 --> 29:11.920
when you had finite, you could count the bytes

29:11.920 --> 29:13.080
that you had to work on this,

29:13.080 --> 29:16.000
you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf

29:16.000 --> 29:17.400
to be one less instruction

29:17.400 --> 29:19.600
than the other person's multiply routine

29:19.600 --> 29:20.440
to kind of get through.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.880
And it was so perfectly crafted.

29:22.880 --> 29:26.480
It was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program

29:26.480 --> 29:28.440
because there just were not that many,

29:28.440 --> 29:31.320
you couldn't afford to be lazy in different ways.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.760
And in many ways, I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work

29:34.760 --> 29:38.440
where again, if you did not have the resources to just say,

29:38.440 --> 29:40.600
well, we're gonna do billions and billions

29:40.600 --> 29:42.680
of programmable weights here,

29:42.680 --> 29:44.480
you have to turn it down into something

29:44.480 --> 29:47.400
that is symbolic and crafted like that.

29:47.400 --> 29:51.160
But that's definitely not the way DNA and life

29:51.160 --> 29:54.160
and biological evolution and things work.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.360
On the one hand, it's almost humbling

29:58.360 --> 30:00.920
how little programming code is in our bodies.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.520
We've got a couple of billion base pairs

30:02.520 --> 30:05.680
and it's like this all fits on a thumb drive for years now.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.360
And then our brains are even a smaller section of that.

30:08.360 --> 30:10.040
You've got maybe 50 megabytes.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.560
And this is not like Shannon limit

30:12.560 --> 30:17.480
perfectly information dense conveyances here.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.480
It's like these are messy codes.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.520
They're broken up into amino acids.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.960
A lot of them don't do important things

30:23.960 --> 30:26.360
or they do things in very awkward ways.

30:26.360 --> 30:30.680
But it is this process of just accumulation on top of things.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.440
And you need scale, both you need scale

30:34.440 --> 30:36.880
for sort of the population for that to work out.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.920
And in the early days in the 50s and 60s,

30:40.240 --> 30:42.680
the kind of ancient era of computers

30:42.680 --> 30:44.400
where you could count when they say,

30:44.400 --> 30:46.240
like when the internet started even in the 70s,

30:46.240 --> 30:48.200
there were like 18 hosts or something on it.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.440
It was this small finite number

30:50.440 --> 30:52.280
and you were still optimizing everything

30:52.280 --> 30:54.560
to be as good as you possibly could be.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.760
But now it's billions and billions of devices

30:57.760 --> 30:59.360
and everything going on.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.560
And you can have this very much natural evolution going on

31:03.560 --> 31:06.000
where lots of things are tried,

31:06.000 --> 31:07.360
lots of things are blowing up,

31:07.360 --> 31:09.440
venture capitalists lose their money.

31:09.440 --> 31:11.840
When a startup invested in the wrong tech stack

31:11.840 --> 31:14.840
and things completely failed or failed to scale.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.440
But good things do come out of it.

31:17.440 --> 31:21.080
And it's interesting to see the mimetic evolution

31:21.080 --> 31:22.680
of the way different things happen,

31:22.680 --> 31:24.440
like mentioning Hello World at the beginning.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.480
It's funny how some little thing like that

31:26.480 --> 31:29.640
where every programmer knows Hello World now.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.160
And that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision

31:32.160 --> 31:35.600
that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C

31:35.600 --> 31:38.440
and early examples of things like that.

31:38.440 --> 31:42.320
So millions of experiments are going on all the time,

31:42.320 --> 31:44.840
but some things do kind of rise to the top

31:44.840 --> 31:48.240
and win the fitness war for whether it's mind space

31:48.240 --> 31:50.400
or programming techniques or anything.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.400
Like there's a site on Stack Exchange called CodeGolf

31:54.400 --> 31:57.960
where people compete to write the shortest possible program

31:57.960 --> 31:59.360
for a particular task

31:59.360 --> 32:01.360
in all the different kinds of languages.

32:01.360 --> 32:06.200
And it's really interesting to see folks kind of,

32:07.200 --> 32:11.640
their masters of their craft really play

32:11.640 --> 32:13.480
with the limits of programming languages.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.640
It's really beautiful to see.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.080
And across all the different programming languages,

32:17.080 --> 32:20.640
you get to see some of these weird programming languages

32:20.640 --> 32:22.600
and mainstream ones,

32:22.600 --> 32:25.160
difference between Python two and three.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.720
You get to see the difference between C and C++ and Java,

32:27.720 --> 32:30.080
and you get to see JavaScript, all of that.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.040
And it's kind of,

32:33.040 --> 32:38.040
inspiring to see how much depth of possibility

32:39.120 --> 32:41.080
there is within programming languages

32:41.080 --> 32:44.200
that CodeGolf kind of tasks reveal.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.600
Most of us, if you do any kind of programming,

32:46.600 --> 32:51.160
you kind of do boring kind of very vanilla type of code.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.880
That's the way to build large systems,

32:52.880 --> 32:54.760
but it's nice to see that the possibility

32:54.760 --> 32:57.640
of creative genius is still within those languages.

32:57.640 --> 33:00.160
It's laden within those languages.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.240
So given that you are, once again,

33:03.240 --> 33:06.000
one of the greatest programmers ever,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.400
what do you think makes a good programmer?

33:08.400 --> 33:11.040
Maybe a good modern programmer.

33:11.040 --> 33:15.720
So I just gave a long rant slash lecture at Meta

33:15.720 --> 33:17.640
to the TPM organization.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.480
And my biggest point was,

33:20.480 --> 33:22.080
everything that we're doing

33:22.080 --> 33:24.640
really should flow from user value.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.160
All the good things that we're doing.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.480
It's like, we're not technical people.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.960
It's like, you shouldn't be taking pride

33:30.960 --> 33:32.080
just in the specific thing.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.600
Like CodeGolf is the sort of thing,

33:33.600 --> 33:34.880
it's a fun puzzle game,

33:34.880 --> 33:38.160
but that really should not be a major motivator for you.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.280
It's like, we're solving problems for people,

33:40.280 --> 33:41.960
or we're providing entertainment to people.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.160
We're doing something of value to people

33:44.160 --> 33:46.240
that's displacing something else in their life.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.000
So we wanna be providing a net value

33:49.000 --> 33:51.360
over what they could be doing,

33:51.360 --> 33:53.520
but instead they're choosing to use our products.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.640
And that's where, I mean, it sounds trite or corny,

33:56.640 --> 33:58.440
but I fundamentally do think

33:58.440 --> 34:00.360
that's how you make the world a better place.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.880
If you have given more value to people

34:02.880 --> 34:05.720
than it took you and your team to create,

34:05.720 --> 34:07.560
then the world's a better place.

34:07.560 --> 34:10.480
People have, they've gone from something of lesser value,

34:10.480 --> 34:11.960
chosen to use your product,

34:11.960 --> 34:13.880
and their life feels better for that.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.280
And if you've produced that economically,

34:16.280 --> 34:18.520
that's a really good thing.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.800
On the other hand, if you spent ridiculous amounts of money,

34:22.800 --> 34:24.320
you've just kind of shoveled a lot of cash

34:24.320 --> 34:25.720
into a wood chipper there,

34:25.720 --> 34:28.120
and you should maybe not feel so good

34:28.120 --> 34:29.680
about what you're doing.

34:29.680 --> 34:33.520
So being proud about like a specific architecture

34:33.520 --> 34:34.920
or a specific technology

34:34.920 --> 34:37.560
or a specific code sequence that you've done,

34:37.560 --> 34:39.120
it's great to get a little smile,

34:39.120 --> 34:41.080
like a tiny little dopamine hit for that,

34:41.080 --> 34:43.280
but the top level metric should be

34:43.280 --> 34:45.400
that you're building things of value.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.000
Now you can get into the argument about how you,

34:48.000 --> 34:49.320
what is user value?

34:49.320 --> 34:51.200
How do you actually quantify that?

34:51.200 --> 34:53.320
And there can be big arguments about that,

34:53.320 --> 34:55.080
but it's easy to be able to say,

34:55.080 --> 34:56.640
okay, this pissed off user there

34:56.640 --> 34:59.040
is not getting value from what you're doing.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.920
This user over there with the big smile on their face,

35:01.920 --> 35:04.200
the moment of delight when something happened,

35:04.200 --> 35:05.880
there's a value that's happened there.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.680
I mean, you have to at least accept

35:07.680 --> 35:09.800
that there is a concept of user value.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.840
Even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it,

35:12.840 --> 35:15.440
you can usually make relative arguments about it.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.240
Well, this was better than this.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.800
We've improved things.

35:18.800 --> 35:23.680
So being a servant to the user is your job

35:23.720 --> 35:25.160
when you're a developer.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.680
You want to be producing something

35:26.680 --> 35:30.000
that other people are going to find valuable.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.520
And if you are technically inclined,

35:32.520 --> 35:35.760
then finding the right levers to be able to pull,

35:35.760 --> 35:37.800
to be able to make a design

35:37.800 --> 35:40.000
that's going to produce the most value

35:40.000 --> 35:41.680
for the least amount of effort.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.000
And it always has to be kind of divided.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.920
There's a ratio there where you,

35:45.920 --> 35:48.080
it's a problem at the big tech companies,

35:48.080 --> 35:52.200
whether it's Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon,

35:52.200 --> 35:55.280
companies that have almost infinite money.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.680
I mean, I know their CFO will complain

35:57.680 --> 35:58.800
that it's not infinite money,

35:58.800 --> 36:00.600
but from most developers' standpoints,

36:00.600 --> 36:02.640
it really does feel like it.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.840
And it's almost counterintuitive

36:04.840 --> 36:07.920
that if you're working hard as a developer on something,

36:07.920 --> 36:08.760
there's always this thought,

36:08.760 --> 36:11.040
if only I had more resources,

36:11.040 --> 36:14.320
more people, more RAM, more megahertz,

36:14.320 --> 36:16.360
then my product will be better.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.680
And that sense that at certain points,

36:18.680 --> 36:21.200
it's certainly true that if you are really hamstrung

36:21.200 --> 36:25.160
by this, removing an obstacle will make a better product,

36:25.160 --> 36:26.960
make more value.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.080
But if you're not making your core design decisions

36:30.080 --> 36:33.040
in this fiercely competitive way

36:33.040 --> 36:35.760
where you're saying feature A or feature B,

36:35.760 --> 36:38.640
you can't just say, let's do both,

36:38.640 --> 36:41.120
because then you're not making a value judgment about them.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.960
You're just saying, well, they both seem good.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.160
I don't want to necessarily have to pick out

36:45.160 --> 36:47.440
which one is better or how much better

36:47.440 --> 36:51.000
and tell team B that, sorry, we're not going to do this

36:51.000 --> 36:53.120
because A is more important.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.800
But that notion of always having

36:55.800 --> 36:57.840
to really critically value what you're doing,

36:57.840 --> 36:59.680
your time, the resources you expend,

36:59.680 --> 37:02.600
even the opportunity cost of doing something else,

37:02.600 --> 37:04.800
that's super important.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.200
Well, let me ask you about this,

37:06.200 --> 37:08.280
the big debates that you're mentioning

37:08.280 --> 37:09.920
of how to measure value.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.080
Is it possible to measure it kind of numerically

37:16.080 --> 37:21.080
or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive, the designer route

37:23.840 --> 37:28.760
of imagining sort of somebody using a thing

37:28.760 --> 37:30.880
and imagining a smile on their face,

37:30.880 --> 37:34.040
imagining the experience of love and joy

37:34.040 --> 37:36.000
that you have when you use the thing.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.360
That's from a design perspective.

37:37.360 --> 37:40.480
Or if you're building more like a lower level thing

37:40.480 --> 37:43.440
for like Linux, you imagine a developer

37:43.480 --> 37:45.480
that might come across this and use it

37:45.480 --> 37:50.480
and become happy and better off because of it.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.640
So where do you land on those things?

37:52.640 --> 37:53.720
Is it measurable?

37:53.720 --> 37:57.320
So I imagine like Meta and Google

37:57.320 --> 37:58.960
will probably try to measure the thing.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.560
They'll try to, it's like you try to optimize engagement

38:01.560 --> 38:03.280
or something, let's measure engagement.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.400
And then I think there is a kind of,

38:06.240 --> 38:09.440
I mean, I admire the designer ethic of like,

38:09.440 --> 38:13.040
think of a future that's immeasurable

38:13.600 --> 38:15.360
and you try to make somebody in that future

38:15.360 --> 38:17.360
that's different from today happy.

38:17.360 --> 38:22.360
So I do usually favor, if you can get any kind of a metric

38:22.920 --> 38:25.880
that's good, by all means, listen to the data.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.520
But you can go too far there where we've had problems

38:28.520 --> 38:30.680
where it's like, hey, we had a performance regression

38:30.680 --> 38:33.320
because our fancy new telemetry system

38:33.320 --> 38:36.040
is doing a bazillion file rights

38:36.040 --> 38:37.240
to kind of archive this stuff

38:37.240 --> 38:38.800
because we needed to collect information

38:38.800 --> 38:42.640
to determine if we were doing, if our plans were good.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.560
So when information is available,

38:45.560 --> 38:46.760
you should never ignore it.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.600
I mean, all of it-

38:47.600 --> 38:49.760
From actual users using the thing,

38:49.760 --> 38:51.440
human beings using the thing,

38:51.440 --> 38:52.920
large number of human beings,

38:52.920 --> 38:54.360
and you get to see sort of at large numbers.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.960
So there's this zero to one problem

38:55.960 --> 38:57.600
of when you're doing something really new,

38:57.600 --> 38:59.320
you do kind of have to make a guess.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.040
But one of the points that I've been making at Meta

39:02.040 --> 39:05.200
is we have more than enough users now

39:05.200 --> 39:08.480
that anything somebody wants to try in VR,

39:08.480 --> 39:10.840
we have users that will be interested in that.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.120
You do not get to make a completely

39:13.120 --> 39:15.840
green field, blue sky pitch and say,

39:15.840 --> 39:17.280
I'm going to do this because

39:17.280 --> 39:18.720
I think it might be interesting.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.160
I challenge everyone.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.680
There are going to be people,

39:21.680 --> 39:24.160
whether it's working in VR on your,

39:25.240 --> 39:26.920
like on your desktop replacement

39:26.920 --> 39:29.600
or communicating with people in different ways

39:29.600 --> 39:31.680
or playing the games.

39:31.680 --> 39:35.160
There are going to be probably millions of people,

39:35.160 --> 39:37.240
or at least if you pick some tiny niche

39:37.240 --> 39:38.720
that we're not in right now,

39:38.720 --> 39:40.840
there's still going to be thousands of people out there

39:40.840 --> 39:43.880
that have the headsets that would be your target market.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.080
And I tell people, pay attention to them.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.720
Don't invent fictional users.

39:47.720 --> 39:50.280
Don't make an Alice Bob Charlie

39:50.280 --> 39:53.600
that fits whatever matrix of tendencies

39:53.600 --> 39:55.400
that you want to break the market down to

39:55.400 --> 39:58.320
because it's a mistake to think about imaginary users

39:58.320 --> 40:01.920
when you've got real users that you could be working with.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.080
But on the other hand,

40:03.080 --> 40:08.080
there is value to having a kind of wholeness of vision

40:08.440 --> 40:09.520
for a product.

40:09.520 --> 40:13.680
And companies like Meta have,

40:13.680 --> 40:15.320
they understand the trade-offs

40:15.320 --> 40:17.600
where you can have a company like SpaceX

40:17.600 --> 40:20.240
or Apple in the Steve Jobs era

40:20.240 --> 40:23.360
where you have a very powerful leading personality

40:23.360 --> 40:26.680
that can micromanage at a very low level

40:26.680 --> 40:29.360
and can say it's like, no, that handle needs to be different

40:29.360 --> 40:32.760
or that icon needs to change the tint there.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.960
And they clearly get a lot of value out of it.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.240
They also burn through a lot of employees

40:37.240 --> 40:39.760
that have horror stories to tell about

40:39.760 --> 40:41.680
working there afterwards.

40:41.680 --> 40:45.120
My position is that you're at your best

40:45.120 --> 40:48.120
when you've got a leader that is at their limit

40:48.120 --> 40:51.480
of what they can kind of comprehend of everything below them

40:51.480 --> 40:53.440
and they can have an informed opinion

40:53.440 --> 40:55.360
about everything that's going on.

40:55.360 --> 40:56.560
And you take somebody,

40:56.560 --> 40:58.000
you've got to believe that somebody

40:58.000 --> 41:01.120
that has 30, 40 years of experience,

41:01.120 --> 41:02.680
you would hope that they've got wisdom

41:02.680 --> 41:06.160
that the just out of bootcamp person contributing

41:06.160 --> 41:08.000
doesn't have and that if they're like,

41:08.000 --> 41:09.120
well, that's wrong there,

41:09.120 --> 41:10.960
you probably shouldn't do it that way

41:10.960 --> 41:14.120
or even just don't do it that way, do it another way.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.520
So there's value there,

41:15.520 --> 41:17.840
but it can't go beyond a certain level.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.400
I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories

41:20.400 --> 41:22.200
of him saying things that are just wrong

41:22.200 --> 41:24.160
right in front of me about technical things

41:24.160 --> 41:26.880
because he was not operating at that level.

41:28.480 --> 41:30.480
But when it does work and you do get

41:30.480 --> 41:32.040
that kind of passionate leader

41:32.040 --> 41:34.120
that's thinking about the entire product

41:34.120 --> 41:36.120
and just really deeply cares about

41:36.120 --> 41:39.080
not letting anything slip through the cracks,

41:39.080 --> 41:40.560
I think that's got a lot of value.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.520
But the other side of that is the people saying that,

41:42.520 --> 41:44.520
well, we wanna have these independent teams

41:44.520 --> 41:46.040
that are bubbling up the ideas

41:46.040 --> 41:49.480
because it's almost it's anti-capitalist

41:49.480 --> 41:51.240
or anti-free market to say it's like,

41:51.240 --> 41:53.760
I want my great leader to go ahead

41:53.760 --> 41:55.240
and dictate all these points there

41:55.240 --> 41:57.680
where clearly free markets bring up things

41:57.680 --> 41:59.360
that you don't expect.

41:59.360 --> 42:01.800
Like in VR, we saw a bunch of things

42:01.800 --> 42:03.080
like it didn't turn out at all

42:03.080 --> 42:04.320
the way the early people thought

42:04.320 --> 42:06.040
were gonna be the key applications

42:06.040 --> 42:08.760
and things that would not have been approved

42:08.760 --> 42:12.240
by the dark cabal making the decisions

42:12.240 --> 42:14.200
about what gets into the store,

42:14.200 --> 42:17.600
turn out to in some cases be extremely successful.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.440
So, yeah, I definitely kind of wanted to be,

42:20.440 --> 42:22.160
there was a point where I did make a pitch.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.800
It's like, hey, make me VR dictator

42:23.800 --> 42:26.120
and I'll go in and get shit done.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.800
And that's just, it's not in the culture at Metta.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.640
And they understand the trade-offs

42:31.600 --> 42:32.920
and that's just not the way,

42:32.920 --> 42:34.440
that's not the company that they want,

42:34.440 --> 42:37.200
the team that they wanna do.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.560
It's fascinating because VR,

42:38.560 --> 42:39.840
and we'll talk about it more,

42:39.840 --> 42:43.000
it's still unclear to me

42:44.200 --> 42:46.880
in what way VR will change the world

42:46.880 --> 42:48.480
because it does seem clear that VR

42:48.480 --> 42:51.680
will somehow fundamentally transform this world

42:51.680 --> 42:53.640
and it's unclear to me how.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.480
Yeah.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.320
And it's-

42:55.320 --> 42:56.400
Let me know when you wanna get into that.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.440
Who will?

42:57.440 --> 42:58.280
Well, hold on a second.

42:58.280 --> 43:02.800
So, in the stick to the you being the best programmer ever.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.040
Okay, in the early days,

43:04.040 --> 43:07.120
when you didn't have adult responsibilities

43:07.120 --> 43:09.360
of leading teams and all that kind of stuff,

43:09.360 --> 43:13.240
and you can focus on just being a programmer,

43:13.240 --> 43:15.160
what did the productive day

43:15.160 --> 43:17.800
in the life of John Carmack look like?

43:17.800 --> 43:19.240
How many hours of the keyboard?

43:19.240 --> 43:20.560
How much sleep?

43:20.560 --> 43:24.320
What was the source of calories that fueled the brain?

43:24.320 --> 43:25.240
What was it like?

43:25.240 --> 43:27.000
What time did you wake up?

43:27.000 --> 43:29.520
So, I was able to be remarkably consistent

43:29.520 --> 43:32.120
about what was good working conditions for me

43:32.120 --> 43:33.560
for a very long time.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.720
I was never one of the programmers

43:36.720 --> 43:39.880
that would do all-nighters going through,

43:39.880 --> 43:41.240
work for 20 hours straight.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.880
It's like my brain generally starts turning to mush

43:43.880 --> 43:45.880
after 12 hours or so,

43:47.240 --> 43:49.960
but the hard work is really important

43:49.960 --> 43:52.200
and I would work for decades.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.720
I would work 60 hours a week.

43:53.720 --> 43:56.280
I would work a 10-hour day, six days a week

43:56.280 --> 43:59.080
and try to be productive at that.

43:59.080 --> 44:01.160
Now, my schedule shifted around a fair amount.

44:01.160 --> 44:03.080
When I was young without any kids

44:03.080 --> 44:05.120
and any other responsibilities,

44:05.120 --> 44:07.320
I was on one of those cycling schedules

44:07.320 --> 44:09.680
where I'd kind of get in an hour later each day

44:09.680 --> 44:12.200
and roll around through the entire time

44:12.200 --> 44:14.280
and I'd wind up kind of pulling in

44:14.280 --> 44:16.280
at two or three in the afternoon sometimes

44:16.280 --> 44:20.120
and then working again past midnight or two in the morning.

44:20.120 --> 44:23.600
And that was, when it was just me

44:23.600 --> 44:26.000
trying to make things happen,

44:26.000 --> 44:28.280
and I was usually isolated off in my office.

44:28.280 --> 44:31.040
People generally didn't bother me much at in

44:31.040 --> 44:35.080
and I could get a lot of programming work done that way.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.360
I did settle into a more normal schedule

44:37.360 --> 44:40.440
when I was taking kids to school and things like that.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.000
So kids were the forcing function

44:42.000 --> 44:44.520
that got you to wake up at the same time.

44:44.520 --> 44:47.360
It's not clear to me that there was much of a difference

44:47.360 --> 44:49.600
in the productivity with that,

44:49.600 --> 44:53.160
where I kind of feel, if I just get up when I feel like it,

44:53.160 --> 44:55.080
it's usually a little later each day,

44:55.080 --> 44:58.240
but I just recently made the focusing decision

44:58.240 --> 45:00.640
to try to push my schedule back a little bit earlier

45:00.640 --> 45:02.680
to getting up at eight in the morning

45:02.680 --> 45:04.880
and trying to shift things around.

45:04.880 --> 45:08.040
Like I'm often doing experiments with myself

45:08.040 --> 45:10.920
about what should I be doing to be more productive?

45:10.920 --> 45:13.320
And one of the things that I did realize

45:13.320 --> 45:15.080
was happening in recent months

45:15.080 --> 45:19.160
where I would go for a walk or a run.

45:19.160 --> 45:21.120
I cover like four miles a day

45:21.120 --> 45:24.760
and I would usually do that just as the sun's going down

45:25.040 --> 45:27.720
here in Texas now and it's still really damn hot,

45:27.720 --> 45:30.240
but I'd go out at 8.30 or something

45:30.240 --> 45:32.960
and cover the time there and then the showering.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.720
And it was putting a hole in my day

45:34.720 --> 45:37.640
where I would have still a couple hours after that.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.520
And sometimes my best hours were at night

45:39.520 --> 45:42.040
when nobody else is around, nobody's bothering me.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.160
But that hole in the day was a problem.

45:44.160 --> 45:45.800
So just a couple of weeks ago,

45:45.800 --> 45:48.080
I made the change to go ahead and say,

45:48.080 --> 45:49.480
all right, I'm gonna get up a little earlier.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.880
I'm gonna do a walk or get out there first

45:51.880 --> 45:54.040
so I can have more uninterrupted time.

45:54.040 --> 45:56.160
So I'm still playing with factors like this

45:56.160 --> 46:00.000
as I kind of optimize my work efforts,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.480
but it's always been, you know,

46:02.480 --> 46:05.040
it was 60 hours a week for a very long time.

46:05.040 --> 46:07.320
To some degree, I had a little thing in the back of my head

46:07.320 --> 46:09.640
where I was almost jealous of some of the programmers

46:09.640 --> 46:11.440
that would do these marathon sessions.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.080
And I had like Dave Taylor, one of the guys that he had,

46:14.080 --> 46:15.240
he would be one of those people

46:15.240 --> 46:17.280
that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes

46:17.280 --> 46:20.200
and all the kind of classic hacker tropes about things.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.840
And a part of me was like always a little bothered

46:22.840 --> 46:23.720
that that wasn't me,

46:23.720 --> 46:27.200
that I wouldn't go program 20 hours straight

46:27.200 --> 46:28.960
because I'm just, I'm falling apart

46:28.960 --> 46:31.840
and not being very effective after 12 hours.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.440
I mean, yeah, 12 hour programming,

46:33.440 --> 46:34.800
that's fine when you're doing that,

46:34.800 --> 46:38.640
but it never, you're not doing smart work much after,

46:38.640 --> 46:41.000
at least I'm not, but there's a range of people.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.560
I mean, that's something that a lot of people

46:42.560 --> 46:44.400
don't really get in their gut,

46:44.400 --> 46:47.320
where there are people that work on four hours of sleep

46:47.320 --> 46:49.520
and are smart and can continue to do good work,

46:49.520 --> 46:52.160
but then there's a lot of people that just fall apart.

46:52.160 --> 46:55.160
So I do tell people that I always try

46:55.160 --> 46:56.400
to get eight hours of sleep.

46:56.400 --> 46:59.960
It's not this, push yourself harder, get up earlier.

46:59.960 --> 47:03.240
I just do worse work where there's,

47:03.240 --> 47:04.640
you can work a hundred hours a week

47:04.640 --> 47:06.240
and still get eight hours of sleep

47:06.240 --> 47:08.840
if you just kind of prioritize things correctly.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.840
But I do believe in working hard, working a lot.

47:12.880 --> 47:15.280
There was a comment that a game dev made

47:15.280 --> 47:19.440
that I know there's a backlash against really hard work

47:19.440 --> 47:22.120
in a lot of cases, and I get into online arguments

47:22.120 --> 47:24.920
about this all the time, but he was basically saying,

47:24.920 --> 47:27.840
yeah, 40 hours a week, that's kind of a part-time job.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.840
And if you were really in it,

47:29.840 --> 47:31.800
you're doing what you think is important,

47:31.800 --> 47:35.400
what you're passionate about, working more gets more done.

47:35.400 --> 47:39.640
And it's just really not possible to argue with that

47:39.640 --> 47:40.960
if you've been around the people

47:40.960 --> 47:44.080
that work with that level of intensity and just say,

47:44.080 --> 47:46.320
it's like, no, they should just stop.

47:46.320 --> 47:49.560
And we had, I kind of came back around to that

47:49.560 --> 47:51.760
a couple of years ago where I was using

47:51.760 --> 47:55.520
the fictional example of, all right, some people say,

47:55.520 --> 47:57.160
they'll say with a straight face, they think,

47:57.160 --> 47:58.960
no, you are less productive

47:58.960 --> 48:01.280
if you work more than 40 hours a week.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.200
And they're generally misinterpreting things

48:03.200 --> 48:06.000
where your marginal productivity for an hour

48:06.000 --> 48:09.080
after eight hours is less than in one of your peak hours,

48:09.080 --> 48:11.320
but you're not literally getting less done.

48:11.320 --> 48:13.400
There is a point where you start breaking things

48:13.400 --> 48:16.720
and getting worse behavior and everything out of it

48:16.720 --> 48:18.520
where you're literally going backwards,

48:18.520 --> 48:21.440
but it's not at eight or 10 or 12 hours.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.840
And the fictional example I would use was,

48:23.840 --> 48:27.280
imagine there's an asteroid coming to impact,

48:27.280 --> 48:30.560
to crash into earth, destroy all of human life.

48:30.560 --> 48:34.320
Do you want Elon Musk or the people working at SpaceX

48:34.320 --> 48:35.760
that are building the interceptor

48:35.760 --> 48:38.600
that's going to deflect the asteroid,

48:38.600 --> 48:40.360
do you want them to clock out at five

48:40.360 --> 48:42.880
because damn it, they're just gonna do worse work

48:42.880 --> 48:44.920
if they work another couple hours.

48:44.920 --> 48:47.280
And it seems absurd.

48:47.280 --> 48:48.760
And that's a hypothetical though,

48:48.760 --> 48:50.120
and everyone can dismiss that,

48:50.120 --> 48:52.200
but then when coronavirus was hitting

48:52.200 --> 48:54.760
and you have all of these medical personnel

48:54.760 --> 48:58.240
that are clearly pushing themselves really, really hard,

48:58.240 --> 49:00.000
and I'd say it's like, okay,

49:00.000 --> 49:03.320
do you want all of these scientists working on treatments

49:03.320 --> 49:05.840
and vaccines and caring for all of these people?

49:05.840 --> 49:07.880
Are they really screwing everything up

49:07.880 --> 49:09.960
by working more than eight hours a day?

49:09.960 --> 49:11.600
And of course, people say I'm just an asshole

49:11.600 --> 49:15.400
to say something like that, but it's the truth.

49:15.400 --> 49:18.240
Working longer gets more done.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.720
So that's kind of the layer one,

49:20.720 --> 49:22.720
but I'd like to also say that,

49:24.040 --> 49:25.960
at least I believe, depending on the person,

49:25.960 --> 49:30.720
depending on the task, working more and harder

49:30.720 --> 49:35.720
will make you better for the next week in those peak hours.

49:37.680 --> 49:41.400
So there's something about a deep dedication to a thing

49:42.560 --> 49:44.840
that kind of gets deep in you.

49:44.880 --> 49:47.400
So the hard work isn't just about

49:47.400 --> 49:49.440
the raw hours of productivity,

49:49.440 --> 49:53.360
it's the thing it does to you

49:54.240 --> 49:56.800
in the weeks and months after too.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.120
You're tempering yourself in some ways.

49:59.120 --> 50:01.960
And I think, it's like Jiro dreams of sushi.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.840
If you really dedicate yourself completely

50:03.840 --> 50:08.080
to making the sushi, to really putting in the long hours,

50:08.080 --> 50:09.640
day after day after day,

50:10.720 --> 50:14.400
you become a true craftsman of the thing you're doing.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.320
Now there's, of course, discussions about,

50:16.320 --> 50:18.960
are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships?

50:18.960 --> 50:21.720
Are you sacrificing a lot of other possible things

50:21.720 --> 50:22.800
you could do with that time?

50:22.800 --> 50:27.800
But if you're talking about purely being a master

50:28.200 --> 50:30.640
or a craftsman of your art,

50:30.640 --> 50:34.960
that more hours isn't just about doing more,

50:34.960 --> 50:37.280
it's about becoming better at the thing you're doing.

50:37.280 --> 50:38.800
Yeah, and I don't gainsay anybody

50:38.800 --> 50:41.160
that wants to work the minimum amount.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.960
They've got other priorities in their life.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.640
My only argument that I'm making,

50:44.640 --> 50:47.000
it's not that everybody should work hard,

50:47.000 --> 50:49.360
it's that if you want to accomplish something,

50:49.360 --> 50:50.800
working longer and harder

50:50.800 --> 50:53.320
is the path to getting it accomplished.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.200
Well, let me ask you about this then,

50:56.160 --> 50:58.880
the mythical work-life balance.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.040
For an engineer, it seems like

51:03.040 --> 51:07.280
that's one of the professions for programmer

51:07.280 --> 51:12.280
where working hard does lead to greater productivity

51:12.280 --> 51:15.240
in it, but it also raises the question

51:15.240 --> 51:18.640
of sort of personal relationships

51:18.640 --> 51:20.280
and all that kind of stuff, family,

51:20.280 --> 51:24.320
and how are you able to find work-life balance?

51:24.320 --> 51:25.720
Is there advice you can give,

51:25.720 --> 51:27.600
maybe even outside of yourself?

51:27.600 --> 51:29.880
Have you been able to arrive at any wisdom

51:29.880 --> 51:32.360
on this part in your years of life?

51:32.360 --> 51:34.600
I do think that there's a wide range of people

51:34.600 --> 51:36.760
where different people have different needs.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.160
It's not a one-size-fits-all,

51:39.160 --> 51:40.760
certainly what works for me.

51:40.760 --> 51:45.160
I can tell enough that I'm different

51:45.160 --> 51:48.600
than a typical average person in the way things impact me,

51:48.600 --> 51:51.560
the things that I wanna do, my goals are different,

51:51.560 --> 51:55.160
and sort of the levers to impact things are different

51:55.160 --> 51:59.560
where I have literally never felt burnout,

51:59.560 --> 52:02.080
and I know there's lots of brilliant, smart people

52:02.080 --> 52:05.360
that do world-leading work that get burned out,

52:05.360 --> 52:08.080
and it's never hit me.

52:08.080 --> 52:11.680
I've never been at a point where I'm like,

52:11.680 --> 52:13.200
I just don't care about this,

52:13.200 --> 52:14.800
I don't wanna do this anymore,

52:14.800 --> 52:16.440
but I've always had the flexibility

52:16.440 --> 52:18.920
to work on lots of interesting things.

52:18.920 --> 52:21.480
I can always just turn my gaze to something else

52:21.480 --> 52:23.480
and have a great time working on that,

52:23.480 --> 52:27.160
and so much of the ability to actually work hard

52:27.160 --> 52:29.640
is the ability to have multiple things to choose from

52:29.640 --> 52:33.120
and to use your time on the most appropriate thing.

52:33.120 --> 52:36.920
There are time periods where it's the best time

52:36.920 --> 52:38.440
for me to read a new research paper

52:38.440 --> 52:41.360
that I need to really be thinking hard about it,

52:41.360 --> 52:43.400
then there's a time that maybe I should just scan

52:43.400 --> 52:44.720
and organize my old notes

52:44.720 --> 52:47.120
because I'm just not on top of things,

52:47.120 --> 52:48.840
then there's the time that, all right,

52:48.840 --> 52:52.680
let's go bang out a few hundred lines of code for something.

52:52.680 --> 52:57.160
So switching between them has been real valuable.

52:57.160 --> 52:59.760
So you always have joy in your heart

52:59.760 --> 53:00.960
for all the things you're doing,

53:00.960 --> 53:03.240
and that is a kind of work-life balance

53:03.240 --> 53:04.800
as a first sort of step.

53:04.800 --> 53:05.640
Yeah, I do.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.480
So you're always happy.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.440
Well, happy, you know.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.400
Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say

53:10.400 --> 53:12.920
that often I look like kind of a grim person

53:12.920 --> 53:15.080
with just sitting there with a neutral expression

53:15.080 --> 53:17.480
or even like knitted brows and a frown on my face

53:17.480 --> 53:18.960
as I'm staring at something.

53:18.960 --> 53:20.640
That's what happiness looks like for you.

53:20.640 --> 53:24.000
Yeah, it's kind of true, where that's like,

53:24.000 --> 53:27.040
okay, I'm pushing through this, I'm making progress here.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.120
I know that doesn't work for everyone.

53:30.120 --> 53:32.080
I know it doesn't work for most people,

53:33.080 --> 53:35.480
but what I am always trying to do in those cases

53:35.760 --> 53:37.040
is I don't wanna let somebody

53:37.040 --> 53:40.520
that might be a person like that be told by someone else

53:40.520 --> 53:44.200
that no, don't even try that out as an option,

53:44.200 --> 53:48.760
where work-life balance versus kind of your life's work,

53:48.760 --> 53:51.760
where there's a small subset of the people

53:51.760 --> 53:55.520
that can be very happy being obsessive about things.

53:55.520 --> 53:58.960
And obsession can often get things done

53:58.960 --> 54:03.200
that just practical, prudent, pedestrian work won't,

54:03.240 --> 54:05.960
or at least won't for a very long time.

54:05.960 --> 54:09.320
There's legends of your nutritional intake

54:10.280 --> 54:11.560
in the early days.

54:11.560 --> 54:16.480
What can you say about sort of being a programmer

54:16.480 --> 54:17.960
as a kind of athlete?

54:17.960 --> 54:21.480
So what was the nutrition that fueled?

54:21.480 --> 54:23.240
I have never been that great

54:23.240 --> 54:26.200
on really paying attention to it,

54:26.200 --> 54:29.640
where I'm good enough that I don't eat a lot.

54:29.640 --> 54:31.680
I've never been like a big heavy guy,

54:31.680 --> 54:34.320
but it was interesting where one of the things

54:34.320 --> 54:36.720
that I can remember being an unhappy teenager,

54:36.720 --> 54:37.880
not having enough money,

54:37.880 --> 54:40.120
and one of the things that bothered me

54:40.120 --> 54:41.200
about not having enough money

54:41.200 --> 54:43.440
is I couldn't buy pizza whenever I wanted to.

54:43.440 --> 54:46.600
So I got rich and then I bought a whole lot of pizza.

54:46.600 --> 54:48.280
So that was the defining,

54:48.280 --> 54:50.120
that's what being rich felt like is you could buy pizza.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.360
A lot of the little things,

54:51.360 --> 54:54.120
I could buy all the pizza and comic books and video games

54:54.120 --> 54:58.880
that I wanted to, and it really didn't take that much,

54:58.880 --> 55:01.000
but the pizza was one of those things,

55:01.040 --> 55:04.520
and it's absolutely true that for a long time it did software.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.720
I had a pizza delivered every single day.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.080
The delivery guy knew me by name,

55:09.080 --> 55:11.680
and I didn't find out until years later

55:11.680 --> 55:13.920
that apparently I was such a good customer

55:13.920 --> 55:15.840
that they just never raised the price on me,

55:15.840 --> 55:18.880
and I was using this six-year-old price for the pizzas

55:18.880 --> 55:21.560
that they were still kind of sending my way every day.

55:21.560 --> 55:26.000
So you were doing eating once a day, or were you?

55:26.000 --> 55:27.040
It would be spread out.

55:27.040 --> 55:28.160
You have a few pieces of pizza,

55:28.160 --> 55:29.360
you have some more later on,

55:29.840 --> 55:31.880
I'd maybe have something at home.

55:31.880 --> 55:34.680
It was one of the nice things at Facebook Meta

55:34.680 --> 55:36.840
is they do, they feed you quite well.

55:36.840 --> 55:39.520
You get a different, I guess now it's DoorDash

55:39.520 --> 55:40.640
sorts of things delivered,

55:40.640 --> 55:42.600
but they take care of making sure

55:42.600 --> 55:44.400
that everybody does get well fed,

55:44.400 --> 55:47.480
and I probably had better food those six years

55:47.480 --> 55:49.560
that I was working in the Meta office there

55:49.560 --> 55:53.880
than I used to before, but it's worked out okay for me.

55:53.880 --> 55:55.240
My health has always been good.

55:55.240 --> 55:57.720
I get a pretty good amount of exercise,

55:57.720 --> 55:59.960
and I don't eat to excess,

55:59.960 --> 56:03.680
and I avoid a lot of other kind of not-so-good-for-you things,

56:03.680 --> 56:05.640
so I'm still doing quite well at my age.

56:05.640 --> 56:10.200
Did you have a kind of, I don't know,

56:10.200 --> 56:12.320
spiritual experience with food,

56:12.320 --> 56:15.080
or coffee, or any of that kind of stuff?

56:15.080 --> 56:18.920
I mean, the programming experience with music,

56:18.920 --> 56:22.080
or like I listen to brown noise on a program,

56:22.080 --> 56:24.360
or like creating an environment,

56:24.360 --> 56:26.120
and the things you take into your body,

56:26.120 --> 56:29.600
just everything you construct can become a kind of ritual

56:29.600 --> 56:32.200
that empowers the whole process of programming.

56:32.200 --> 56:34.640
Did you have that relationship with pizza, or?

56:34.640 --> 56:35.960
It would really be with Diet Coke.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.080
I mean, there still is that sense of, you know,

56:38.080 --> 56:40.520
drop the can down, crack open the can of Diet Coke.

56:40.520 --> 56:41.880
All right, now I mean business.

56:41.880 --> 56:44.040
We're getting to work here.

56:44.040 --> 56:46.880
Still, to this day, is Diet Coke still part of it?

56:46.880 --> 56:49.520
Yeah, probably eight or nine a day.

56:49.520 --> 56:52.080
Nice, okay, what about your setup?

56:52.080 --> 56:55.080
How many screens, what kind of keyboard?

56:55.080 --> 56:56.080
Is there something interesting?

56:57.080 --> 57:01.120
What kind of IDE, Emacs Vim, or something modern?

57:02.040 --> 57:04.120
Linux, what operating system, laptop,

57:04.120 --> 57:07.000
or any interesting thing that brings you joy?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.160
So, I kind of migrated cultures,

57:09.160 --> 57:11.400
where early on, through all of game dev,

57:11.400 --> 57:13.160
there was sort of one culture there,

57:13.160 --> 57:15.600
which was really quite distinct from the more,

57:15.600 --> 57:19.200
the Silicon Valley venture, you know, culture for things.

57:19.200 --> 57:21.480
They're different groups, and they have pretty different

57:21.480 --> 57:24.520
mores in the way they think about things, where,

57:24.560 --> 57:26.560
and I still do think a lot of the big companies

57:26.560 --> 57:30.520
can learn things from the hardcore game development

57:30.520 --> 57:32.960
side of things, where it still boggles my mind

57:32.960 --> 57:37.960
how hostile to debuggers and IDEs that so much of them,

57:39.160 --> 57:41.680
the kind of big money, get billions of dollars,

57:41.680 --> 57:44.400
Silicon Valley, venture-backed funds are.

57:44.400 --> 57:46.240
Oh, that's interesting, sorry, so you're saying,

57:46.240 --> 57:50.200
like big companies like Google and Meta are hostile to?

57:50.200 --> 57:52.840
They are not big on debuggers and IDEs,

57:53.120 --> 57:55.760
so much of it is, like, Emax, Vim, for things,

57:55.760 --> 57:58.840
and we just assume that debuggers don't work

57:58.840 --> 58:01.080
most of the time for the systems,

58:01.080 --> 58:03.800
and a lot of this comes from a sort of Linux bias

58:03.800 --> 58:06.440
on a lot of things, where I did come up

58:06.440 --> 58:09.080
through the personal computers, and then the DOS,

58:09.080 --> 58:14.040
and then Windows, and it was Borland Tools,

58:14.040 --> 58:16.800
and then Visual Studio, and-

58:16.800 --> 58:18.520
Do you appreciate debuggers?

58:18.520 --> 58:21.400
Very much so, I mean, a debugger is how you get a view

58:21.400 --> 58:23.880
into a system that's too complicated to understand.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.840
I mean, anybody that thinks just read the code

58:25.840 --> 58:28.640
and think about it, that's an insane statement in the,

58:28.640 --> 58:31.040
you can't even read all the code on a big system,

58:31.040 --> 58:34.120
you have to do experiments on the system,

58:34.120 --> 58:37.720
and doing that by adding log statements, recompiling,

58:37.720 --> 58:40.720
and rerunning it is an incredibly inefficient way

58:40.720 --> 58:43.520
of doing it, I mean, yes, you can always get things done,

58:43.520 --> 58:46.400
even if you're working with stone knives and bearskins,

58:46.400 --> 58:48.840
that is the mark of a good programmer,

58:48.840 --> 58:51.160
is that given any tools, you will figure out

58:51.160 --> 58:54.840
a way to get it done, but it's amazing what you can do

58:54.840 --> 58:57.200
with sometimes much, much better tools,

58:57.200 --> 58:59.920
where instead of just going through this iterative

58:59.920 --> 59:04.760
compile run debug cycle, you have the old Lisp direction

59:04.760 --> 59:07.040
of like, you've got a REPL, and you're working interactively

59:07.040 --> 59:09.720
and doing amazing things there, but in many cases,

59:09.720 --> 59:12.400
a debugger has a very powerful user interface

59:12.400 --> 59:14.680
that can stop, examine all the different things

59:14.680 --> 59:16.960
in your program, set all of these different breakpoints,

59:16.960 --> 59:20.240
and of course, you can do that with GDB or whatever there,

59:20.240 --> 59:22.800
but this is one of the user interface

59:22.800 --> 59:24.760
fundamental principles, where when something

59:24.760 --> 59:28.520
is complicated to do, you won't use it very often.

59:28.520 --> 59:30.680
There's people that will break out GDB

59:30.680 --> 59:32.760
when they're at their wits end, and they just have

59:32.760 --> 59:35.200
beat their head against a problem for so long,

59:35.200 --> 59:37.880
but for somebody that kind of grew up in game dev,

59:37.880 --> 59:40.120
it's like they were running into the debugger anyways

59:40.120 --> 59:42.200
before they even knew there was a problem,

59:42.200 --> 59:44.840
and you would just stop and see what was happening,

59:44.840 --> 59:46.400
and sometimes you could fix things

59:46.440 --> 59:50.640
even before you did one compile cycle.

59:50.640 --> 59:52.200
You could be in the debugger, and you could say,

59:52.200 --> 59:54.280
well, I'm just going to change this right here,

59:54.280 --> 59:57.040
and yep, that did the job, and fix it and go on.

59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.000
And for people that don't know, GDB is a sort of popular,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I guess, Linux debugger, primarily for C++?

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.680
They handle most of the languages,

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.480
but it's based on C as the original kind of Unix heritage.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.800
And it's kind of like command line,

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.200
it's not user-friendly, it doesn't allow

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.240
for clean visualizations, and you're exactly right.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.000
So you're using this kind of debugger,

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.080
usually when you're at wits end,

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.440
and there's a problem that you can't figure out why

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.000
by just looking at the codes, you have to find it.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.600
That's how, I guess, normal programmers use it.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.320
But you're saying there should be tools that kind of

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.340
visualize and help you as part of the programming process,

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.880
just the normal programming process,

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.960
to understand the code deeper.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.920
Yeah, when I'm working on my C, C++ code,

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.600
I'm always running it from the debugger.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.920
Just I type in the code, I run it,

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.280
many times the first thing I do after writing code

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.080
is set a breakpoint and step through the function.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.160
Now, other people will say, it's like,

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.540
oh, I do that in my head.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.840
Well, your head is a faulty interpreter

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.080
of all those things there, and I've written brand new code,

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.000
I wanna step in there, and I'm gonna single step

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.760
through that, examine lots of things,

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.560
and see if it's actually doing what I expected it to.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.240
It is a kind of companion, the debugger.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.880
You're now coding in an interactive way

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.760
with another being.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.460
A debugger is a kind of dumb being,

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.400
but it's a reliable being.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.240
That is an interesting question of what role does AI play

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.560
in that kind of, with codecs and this kind of ability

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.640
to generate code that might be,

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.240
you might start having tools that understand the code

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.840
in interesting, deep ways that can work with you.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.360
There's a whole spectrum there from static code analyzers

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.480
and various kind of dynamic tools there up to AI

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.680
that can conceivably grok these programs

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.520
that literally no human can understand.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.000
They're too big, too intertwined, and too interconnected,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
but it's not beyond the possibility of understanding.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.840
It's just beyond what we can hold in our heads

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.900
as kind of mutable state while we're working on things.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.280
And I'm a big proponent, again,

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.180
of things like static analyzers and some of that stuff

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:09.720
where you'll find some people that don't like

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.680
being scolded by a program for how they've written something

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:15.440
where it's like, oh, I know better, and sometimes you do,

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.200
but that was something that it was very, very valuable

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.260
for me when, and not too many people get an opportunity

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.100
like this to have.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.120
This is almost one of those spiritual experiences

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.940
as a programmer, an awakening to.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:31.560
The id software code bases were a couple million lines

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.720
of code, and at one point I had used a few

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.960
of the different analysis tools, but I made a point

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.960
to really go through and scrub the code base

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:43.320
using every tool that I could find.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.640
And it was eye-opening where we had a reputation

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.040
for having some of the most robust, strongest code.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.720
There were some great things that I remember hearing

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.000
from Microsoft telling us about crashes on Xbox,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.840
and we had this tiny number that they said

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.440
were probably literally hardware errors.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.400
And then you have other significant titles

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.400
that just have millions of faults

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.920
that are getting recorded all the time.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.640
So I was proud of our code on a lot of levels,

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.720
but when I took this code analysis squeegee

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.720
through everything, it was shocking how many errors

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:16.760
there were in there.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.820
Things that you can say, okay, this was a copy paste,

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.560
not changing something right here, lots of things

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:26.000
that were, the most common problem was something

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.160
in a printf format string that was the wrong data type

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.480
that could cause crashes there.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.400
And you really want the warnings for things like that.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:36.200
Then the next most common was missing a check for null

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.480
that could actually happen, that could blow things up.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.640
And those are obviously like top C, C++ things.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.440
Everybody has those problems.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.260
But the long tail of all of the different little things

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.180
that could go wrong there, and we had good programmers

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:51.080
and my own code stuff that I'd be looking at.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.760
It's like, oh, I wrote that code, that's definitely wrong.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.520
We've been using this for a year, and it's this summer,

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.720
this mine sitting there waiting for us to step on.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.760
And it was humbling.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.560
And I reached the conclusion that anything

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.800
that can be syntactically allowed in your language,

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.460
if it's gonna show up eventually in a large enough code base,

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.760
you're not gonna, good intentions aren't going to keep it

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.440
from happening, you need automated tools

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.840
and guardrails for things.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.080
And those start with things like static types

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:27.000
and or even type hints in the more dynamic languages.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.220
But the people that rebel against that,

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.680
that basically say, that slows me down doing that.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.280
There's something to that, I get that.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.200
I've written, I've cobbled things together in a notebook.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.040
I am like, wow, this is great that it just happened.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.400
But yeah, that's kind of sketchy, but it's working fine.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.240
I don't care.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.140
It does come back to that value analysis

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.760
where sometimes it's right to not care.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.480
But when you do care, if it's going to be something

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.880
that's going to live for years

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.480
and it's gonna have other people working on it,

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.040
and it's gonna be deployed to millions of people,

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.200
then you wanna use all of these tools.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.800
You wanna be told, it's like, no,

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.360
you've screwed up here, here and here.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.040
And that does require kind of an ego check about things

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.160
where you have to be open to the fact

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.260
that everything that you're doing

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.040
is just littered with flaws.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.400
It's not that, oh, you occasionally have a bad day.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.200
It's just whatever stream of code you output,

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.760
there is going to be a statistical regularity of things

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.160
that you just make mistakes on.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.400
And I do think there's the whole argument

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.000
about test-driven design and unit testing

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:33.040
versus kind of analysis and different things.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.040
I am more in favor of the analysis and the stuff

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.680
that just like you can't run your program

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.280
until you fix this rather than you can run it

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.000
and hopefully a unit test will catch it in some way.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.760
Yeah, in my private code, I have asserts everywhere.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.080
Yeah.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.280
It just, there's something pleasant to me,

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.440
pleasurable to me about sort of the dictatorial rule

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.380
of like, this should be true at this point.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:03.300
In too many times, I've made mistakes

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.820
that shouldn't have been made.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:08.460
And I would assume I wouldn't be the kind of person

01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:09.340
that would make that mistake,

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.580
but I keep making that mistake.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.940
Therefore, an assert really catches me,

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:15.340
really helps all the time.

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:19.020
So my code, I would say like 10 to 20% of my private code

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.340
just for personal use is probably asserts.

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.540
And they're active comments.

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.900
That's one of those things that in theory,

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.220
they don't make any difference to the program

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:28.580
and if it was all operating

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:30.260
the way you expected it would be,

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.740
then they will never fire.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.640
But even if you have it right

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.820
and you wrote the code right initially,

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.380
then circumstances change.

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.840
The world outside your program changes.

01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.620
And in fact, that's one of the things where

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.460
I'm kind of fond in a lot of cases

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:47.540
of static array size declarations

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.860
where I went through this period where it's like,

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.960
okay, now we have general collection classes.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.460
We should just make everything variable

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.540
because I had this history of in the early days,

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.020
you get doom, which had some fixed limits on it.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.560
Then everybody started making crazier and crazier things

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.180
and they kept bumping up the different limits,

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.820
this many lines, this many sectors.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.020
And it seemed like a good idea.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.900
Well, we should just make this completely generic.

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:13.760
It can go kind of go up to whatever.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:17.340
And there's cases where that's the right thing to do,

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:19.820
but it also, the other aspect of the world

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:23.040
changing around you is it's good to be informed

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.720
when the world has changed more than you thought it would.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.400
And if you've got a continuously growing collection,

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.560
you're never gonna find out.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:32.200
You might have this quadratic slowdown on something

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.440
where you thought, oh, I'm only ever gonna have

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.880
a handful of these, but something changes

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.240
and there's a new design style

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.800
and all of a sudden you've got 10,000 of them.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.900
So I kind of like in many cases picking a number,

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:47.560
some nice round power of two number

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:49.920
and setting it up in there and having an assert saying,

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.160
it's like, hey, you hit this limit.

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.360
You should probably think are the choices

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.920
that you've made around all of this still relevant

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.260
if somebody's using 10 times more

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.360
than you thought they would.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.640
Yeah, this code was originally written

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.400
with this kind of worldview,

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.080
with this kind of set of constraints.

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.380
You were thinking of the world in this way.

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:11.720
If something breaks, that means you gotta rethink

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.080
the initial stuff.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.480
And it's nice for it to do that.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:21.480
Is there any stuff like a keyboard or monitors?

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.840
I'm fairly pedestrian on a lot of that

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.160
where I did move to triple monitors

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.720
like in the last several years ago.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.240
I had been dual monitor for a very long time

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.800
and it was one of those things

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.680
where probably years later than I should have,

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.020
I'm just like, well, the video cards now

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.720
generally have three output ports.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.480
I should just put the third monitor up there.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:41.940
That's been a pure win.

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.480
I've been very happy with that.

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:48.320
But no, I don't have fancy keyboard or mouse or anything.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:52.600
The key things is an IDE that has helpful debuggers,

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.160
has helpful tools.

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.040
So it's not the Emacs Vim route and then Diet Coke.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.840
Yeah, so I did spend,

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.480
I spent one of my week long retreats

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.320
where I'm like, okay, I'm gonna make myself use,

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.600
it was actually classic VI,

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.520
which I know people will say

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.440
you should never have done that.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:09.400
You should have just used Vim directly.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.400
But I gave it the good try.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.080
It's like, okay, I'm being in kind of classic

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.800
Unix developer mode here.

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.640
And I worked for a week on it.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.160
I used Anki to like teach myself

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:24.080
the different little key combinations for things like that.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:25.740
And in the end, it was just like,

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.000
all right, this was kind of like

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.040
my Civil War reenactment phase.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.080
It's like, I'm going out there

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.040
doing it like they used to in the old days.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.120
And it was kind of fun in that regard.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.400
So many people right now.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.720
They're screaming as they're listening to this.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.280
So again, the out is that this was not modern Vim,

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.120
but still, yes, I was very happy

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.920
to get back to my visual studio at the end.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.600
Yeah, I'm actually, I struggle with this a lot

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.160
because I use a Kinesis keyboard

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.080
and I use Emacs primarily.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.200
And I feel like I can, exactly as you said,

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.320
I can understand the code.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.360
I can navigate the code.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.040
There's a lot of stuff you could build

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.880
within Emacs with using Lisp.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.360
You can customize a lot of things for yourself

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:09.960
to help you introspect the code,

01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.720
like to help you understand the code

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.120
and visualize different aspects of the code.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.680
You can even run the buggers, but it's work.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.960
And the world moves past you

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.880
and the better and better ideas are constantly being built.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.440
And that puts a kind of,

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.240
I need to take the same kind of retreat

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.320
as you're talking about,

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.880
but now I'm still fighting the civil war.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.240
I need to kind of move into the 21st century.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.960
And it does seem like the world is,

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.680
or a large chunk of the world

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.680
is moving towards visual studio code,

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.400
which is kind of interesting to me.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.240
Again, it's the JavaScript ecosystem on the one hand,

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.440
and IDs are one of those things

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.880
that you want to be infinitely fast.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.000
You want them to just kind of immediately respond.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.520
And like, I mean, heck, I've got,

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:53.400
there's someone I know,

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:55.160
I'm an old school game dev guy

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.440
that still uses Visual Studio 6.

01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:59.520
And on a modern computer,

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.000
everything is just absolutely instant on something like that,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.680
because it was made to work on a computer

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.840
that's 10,000 or a hundred thousand times slower.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.560
So just everything happens immediately.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.560
And all the modern systems just feel,

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.360
they feel so crufty when it's like,

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.280
oh, why is this refreshing the screen

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.280
and moving around and updating over here

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.680
and something blinks down there

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.880
and you should update this.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.720
And there are things that we've lost

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.360
with that incredible flexibility,

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.080
but lots of people get tons of value from it.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.840
And I am super happy that that seems to be winning over

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.160
even a lot of the old Vim and Emacs people,

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.160
that they're kind of like,

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.840
hey, Visual Studio code's maybe not so bad.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.240
That may be the final peacekeeping solution

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.560
where everybody is reasonably happy

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.840
with something like that.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.520
So can you explain what a .plan file is

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.360
and what role that played in your life?

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.480
Does it still continue to play a role?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.640
Back in the early, early days of id Software,

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.160
one of our big things that was unique with what we did

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.640
is I had adopted next stations or kind of next step systems

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.680
from Steve Jobs' out in the woods away from Apple company.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.200
And they were basically, it was kind of interesting

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.160
because I did not really have a background

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.080
with the Unix system.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:21.840
So many of the people, they get immersed in that in college

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.840
and that sets a lot of cultural expectations for them.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.320
And I didn't have any of that,

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.960
but I knew that my background was,

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.480
I was a huge Apple II fan boy.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.920
I was always a little suspicious of the Mac.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.440
It was not really what kind of I wanted to go with.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.600
But when Steve Jobs left Apple and started next,

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:47.000
this computer did just seem like one of those amazing things

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.520
from the future where it had all of this cool stuff in it.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.360
And we were still back in those days working on DOS,

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.280
everything blew up.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.320
You had reset buttons because your computer

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.440
would just freeze if you're doing development work,

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.960
literally dozens of times a day,

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.440
your computer was just rebooting constantly.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.440
And so this idea of, yes, any of the Unix workstations

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.680
would have given a stable development platform

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.480
where you don't crash and reboot all the time.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.600
But Next also had this really amazing graphical interface

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.480
and it was great for building tools

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.480
and it used Objective-C as the kind of an interesting.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.320
Oh, wow.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.160
So Next was Unix based, it said Objective-C.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.840
So it has a lot of the elements.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:28.760
That became Mac.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.440
I mean, the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple by Next

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.360
where that took over and became

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.400
what the modern Mac system is.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.320
And define some of the developer,

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.480
like the tools and the whole community.

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.320
Yeah, you've still got,

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.840
if you're programming on Apple stuff now,

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.640
there's still all these NS somethings,

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.680
which was originally Next Step Objects

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:49.440
of different kinds of things.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.920
But one of the aspects of those Unix systems

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.240
was they had this notion of a .plan file

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.600
where a .file is an invisible file,

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:02.040
usually in your home directory or something.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.400
And there was a trivial server

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.920
running on most Unix systems at the time

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.640
that when somebody ran a trivial little command

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.960
called finger, you could do finger

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.520
and then somebody's address,

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.120
it could be anywhere on the internet

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.760
if you were connected correctly.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.760
Then all that server would do was read the .plan file

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.480
in that user's home directory

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.480
and then just spit it out to you.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.160
And originally the idea was that could be,

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.320
whether you're on vacation,

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.040
what your current project was,

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.280
it's supposed to be like the plan of what you're doing.

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.680
And people would use it for various purposes,

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.200
but all it did was dump that file over

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.640
to the terminal of whoever issued the finger command.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.800
And at one point I started just keeping a list

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.840
of what I was doing in there,

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.040
which would be what I was working on in the day.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.560
And I would have this little syntax

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.680
I kind of got to myself about,

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.120
here's something that I'm working on.

01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.720
I put a star when I finish it.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:01.400
I could have a few other little bits of punctuation.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.920
And at the time it was,

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.560
it started off as being just like my to-do list.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.640
And it would be these trivial obscure little things

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.760
like I fixed something with collision detection code,

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.920
made imp fireball do something different

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.240
and just little one-liners

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.320
that people that were following the games

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.080
could kind of decipher.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.840
But I did wind up starting to write

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.240
much more in-depth things.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:28.480
I would have little notes of thoughts and insights.

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.440
And then I would eventually start having little essays

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.040
I would sometimes dump into the .plan files

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.200
interspersed with the work logs of things that I was doing.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.640
So in some ways it was like a super early proto blog

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:42.640
where I was just kind of dumping out what I was working on,

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.240
but it was interesting enough

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.680
that there were a lot of people

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.760
that were interested in this.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.280
So most of the people didn't have Unix workstations.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.320
So there were the websites back in the day

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.520
that would follow the Doom and Quake development

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.400
that would basically make a little service

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.800
that would go grab all the changes

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.200
and then people could just get it with a web browser.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.960
And there was a period where like all of the little

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.600
kind of Dallas gaming diaspora of people

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.360
that were at all in that orbit,

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.200
there were a couple dozen .plan files going on,

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.480
which was, and this was some years before blogging

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.200
really became kind of a thing.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:20.440
And it was kind of a premonition

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:22.240
of sort of the way things would go.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.080
And there was, it's all been collected.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.120
It's available online in different places.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.320
And it's kind of fun to go back

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.800
and look through what I was thinking,

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:32.480
what I was doing in the different areas.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.840
Have you had a chance to look back?

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.360
Is there some interesting,

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.760
very low level specific to do items,

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.440
maybe things you've never completed,

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.480
all that kind of stuff

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.480
and high level philosophical essay type of stuff that stands out?

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.400
Yeah, there's some good stuff on both

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:52.000
where a lot of it was low level nitpicky details

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.880
about game dev and I've learned enough things

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.320
where there's no project that I worked on

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.920
that I couldn't go back and do a better job on now.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.040
I mean, you just, you learn things hopefully

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:03.880
if you're doing it right,

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.360
you learn things as you get older

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.360
and you should be able to do a better job

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:08.720
at all of the early things.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.240
And there's stuff in Wolfenstein Doomquake that's like,

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.800
oh, clearly I could go back and do a better job at this,

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.920
whether it's something in the rendering engine side

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.960
or how I implemented the monster behaviors

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.920
or managed resources or anything like that.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.200
Do you see the flaws in your thinking now?

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.040
Yeah.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:26.880
Like looking back?

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.720
Yeah, I do.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.080
I mean, sometimes I'll get the,

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:29.920
I'll look at it and say,

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.760
yeah, I had a pretty clear view of,

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.960
I was doing good work there

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:35.960
and I haven't really hit the point

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:38.760
where there was another programmer, Graham Devine,

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.760
who was, he had worked at Id and Seventh Guest

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.680
and he made some comment one time

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.680
where he said he looked back at some of his old notes

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:48.760
and he was like, wow, I was really smart back then

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.200
and I don't hit that so much where,

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.320
I mean, I look at it and I always know that,

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.040
yeah, there's all the,

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.640
with aging, you get certain changes

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:00.080
in how you're able to work problems,

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.320
but all of the problems that I've worked,

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.320
I'm sure that I could do a better job on all of them.

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.160
Oh, wow.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.440
So you can still step right in.

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.960
If you could travel back in time and talk to that guy,

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.120
you would teach him a few things.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.160
Yeah, absolutely.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.960
That's awesome.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.040
What about the high level philosophical stuff?

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:20.640
Is there some insights that stand out that you remember?

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.440
There's things that I was understanding about development

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.200
and in the industry and so on

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.400
that were in a more primitive stage

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.400
where I definitely learned a lot more in the later years

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.360
about business and organization and team structure.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.640
There were, I mean, there were definitely things

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.880
that I was not the best person

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.960
or even a very good person about managing,

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.640
like how a team should operate internally,

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.480
how people should work together.

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.320
I was just, you know,

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.720
just get out of my way and let me work on the code

01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.560
and do this.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.320
And more and more I've learned how,

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:05.000
in the larger scheme of things,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.400
how sometimes relatively unimportant some of those things are,

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.080
where it is this user value generation

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.080
that's the overarching importance for all of that.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.960
And I didn't necessarily have my eye on that ball correctly

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:21.200
through a lot of my earlier years.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:25.600
And there's things that I could have gotten more out of people

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.200
handling things in different ways.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.040
I could have made in some ways more successful products

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.840
by following things in different ways.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.360
There's mistakes that we made

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.200
that we couldn't really have known

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.560
how things would have worked out,

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.720
but it was interesting to see in later years,

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:42.360
companies like Activision showing that,

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.960
hey, you really can just do the same game,

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.600
make it better every year.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.600
And you can look at that from a negative standpoint

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.520
and say, it's like, oh, that's just being derivative

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.520
and all that.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.600
But if you step back again and say, it's like, no,

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.480
are the people buying it still enjoying it?

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.520
Are they enjoying it more

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.080
than what they might have bought otherwise?

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.920
And you can say, no, that's actually

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.720
a great value creation engine to do that

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.760
if you're in a position where you can.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.320
Don't be forced into reinventing everything

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.320
just because you think that you need to.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.920
Lots of things about business and team stuff

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.040
that could be done better.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.480
But the technical work,

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.760
the kind of technical visionary type stuff

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.880
that I laid out, I still feel pretty good about.

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.080
There are some classic old ones about

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:29.280
my defending of OpenGL versus D3D,

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.200
which turned out to be one of the more

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.480
probably important momentous things there

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.880
where it was always a rear guard action on Windows

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.320
where Microsoft was just not gonna let that win,

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.400
but when I look back on it now,

01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:46.720
that fight to keep OpenGL relevant

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.800
for a number of years there

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:52.640
meant that OpenGL was there when mobile started happening

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.680
and OpenGL ES was the thing that drove

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.600
all of the acceleration of the mobile industry.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:00.960
And it's really only in the last few years

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.560
as Apple's moved to metal

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.040
and some of the other companies have moved to Vulcan,

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.760
that that's moved away.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.520
But really stepping back and looking at it,

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.960
it's like, yeah, I sold tens of millions of games

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.640
for different things,

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.720
but billions and billions of devices

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:21.280
wound up with an appropriate capable graphics API

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.440
due in no small part to me

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.240
thinking that that was really important

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:29.120
that we not just give up and use Microsoft's

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.000
at that time really terrible API.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.880
The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay terrible.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.640
They were terrible at the start,

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.120
but a few versions on they were actually quite good

01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.680
and there was a completely fair argument

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:45.120
that by the time DX9 was out,

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:48.480
it was probably a better programming environment than OpenGL,

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.160
but it was still a wonderful good thing

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:52.600
that we had an open standard

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.920
that could show up on Linux and Android and iOS

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.680
and eventually WebGL still to this day.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:03.160
So that would be on my greatest hits list of things

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.000
that I kind of pushed with.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.760
In terms of impact it had on billions of devices, yes.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.000
So let's talk about it.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.400
Can you tell the origin story of id Software?

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.360
Again, one of the greatest game developer companies ever.

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.520
It created Wolfenstein 3D,

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.600
games that define my life also in many ways

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.280
as a thing that made me realize

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.680
what computers are capable of in terms of graphics,

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.360
in terms of performance.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:32.040
It just unlocked something deep in me

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.200
and understanding what these machines are all about

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.160
as games can do that.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:37.440
So Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake,

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:40.720
and just all the incredible engineering innovation

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.840
that went into that.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.320
So how did it all start?

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.960
So I'll caveat upfront

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:49.520
that I usually don't consider myself the historian

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.520
of the software side of things.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:55.040
I usually do kind of point people at John Romero

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.120
for stories about the early days

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.160
where I've never been,

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.000
like I've commented

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
that I'm a remarkably unsentimental person in some ways

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.800
where I don't really spend a lot of time

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.320
unless I'm explicitly prodded

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.320
to go back and think about the early days of things.

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.680
And I didn't necessarily make the effort

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.120
to archive everything exactly in my brain.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.480
And the more that I work on machine learning and AI

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.920
and the aspects of memory

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.400
and how when you go back and polish certain things,

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.960
it's not necessarily exactly the way it happened.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.600
But having said all of that from my view,

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.720
the way everything happened that led up to that was

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:36.200
after I was an adult

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:38.200
and kind of taking a few college classes,

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.600
deciding to drop out,

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:43.640
I was doing, I was hardscrabble contract programming work,

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.240
really struggling to kind of keep groceries

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:48.120
and pay my rent and things.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.560
And the company that I was doing the most work for

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.200
was a company called Softdisk Publishing,

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:57.120
which had the sounds bizarre now business model

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.560
of monthly subscription software.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.120
You know, before there was an internet

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.680
that people could connect to and get software,

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.800
you would pay, you know, a certain amount

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.520
and every month they would send you a disk

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.760
that had some random software on it.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.480
And people that were into computers

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.720
thought this was kind of cool.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.960
And they had different ones for the Apple II,

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.880
the 2GS, the PC, the Mac, the Amiga,

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.040
lots of different things here.

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.440
So quirky little business,

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.560
but I was doing a lot of contract programming for them

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.480
where I'd write tiny little games

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:29.960
and sell them for 300, $500.

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.640
And one of the things that I was doing,

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.440
again, to keep my head above water here

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.040
was I decided that I could make one program

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.040
and I could port it to multiple systems.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:44.880
So I would write a game like Dark Designs or Catacombs

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.040
and I would develop it on the Apple II,

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.880
the 2GS and the IBM PC,

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:51.760
which apparently was the thing

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.280
that really kind of piqued the attention

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.400
of the people working down there.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.520
Like Jay Wilbur was my primary editor

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.200
and Tom Hall was a secondary editor.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.400
And they kept asking me,

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.040
it's like, hey, you should come down and work for us here.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.280
And I pushed it off a couple of times

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.240
because I was really enjoying my freedom

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.800
of kind of being off on my own,

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.680
even if I was barely getting by, I loved it.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:17.720
I was doing nothing but programming all day.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.840
But I did have enough close scrapes

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.960
with like, damn, I'm just really out of money

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.000
that maybe I should get an actual job

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.880
rather than contracting these kind of one at a time things.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.360
And Jay Wilbur was great.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.720
He was like FedExing me the checks when I would need them

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:35.680
to kind of get over whatever hump I was at.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.720
So I finally took them up on their offer

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:41.240
to come down to Shreveport, Louisiana.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:43.840
I was in Kansas City at the time,

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:47.320
drove down through the Ozarks and everything

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:51.840
down to Louisiana and saw the soft disc offices,

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.760
went through, talked to a bunch of people,

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.800
met the people I had been working with remotely at that time.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.560
But the most important thing for me was

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.320
I met two programmers there, John Romero and Lane Roth,

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.760
that for the first time ever,

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:08.480
I had met programmers that knew more cool stuff than I did

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:11.000
where the world was just different back then.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.400
I was in Kansas City.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.600
It was one of those smartest kid in the school,

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.960
does all the computer stuff.

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.120
The teachers don't have anything to teach him.

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.360
But all I had to learn from

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.240
was these few books at the library.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.920
It was not much at all.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.200
And there were some aspects of programming

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.200
that were kind of black magic to me.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.720
It's like, oh, he knows how to format a track

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:34.320
on a low-level drive programming interface.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:37.400
And this was, I was still not at all sure

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.560
I was gonna take the job,

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.840
but I met these awesome programmers

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.320
that were doing cool stuff.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.360
And Romero had worked at Origin Systems

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:49.000
and he had done so many different games ahead of time

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.720
that I did kind of quickly decide,

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.200
it's like, yeah, I'll go take the job down there.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:57.080
And I settled down there, moved in,

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.920
and started working on more little projects.

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:03.080
And the first kind of big change that happened down there

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.640
was the company wanted to make a gaming-focused,

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:08.280
a PC gaming-focused subscription.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.200
Just like all their other,

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.880
it was the same formula that they used for everything.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.760
Pay a monthly fee and you'll get a disc

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.920
with one or two games just every month.

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.320
And no choice in what you get,

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.920
but we think it'll be fun.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.000
And that was the model they were comfortable with

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:22.840
and said, all right,

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.160
we're gonna start this gamer's edge department.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.880
And all of us that were interested in that,

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.440
like me, Romero, Tom Hall was kind of helping us

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:34.120
from his side of things, Jay would peek in,

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:36.560
and we had a few other programmers

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.240
working with us at the time.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.280
And we were going to just start making games,

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.400
just the same model.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.880
And we dived in and it was fantastic.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.560
You have to make new games.

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:48.400
Every month.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.220
Every month.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.060
Yeah.

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:52.760
And this, in retrospect, looking back at it,

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.400
that sense that I had done all this contract programming

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:58.080
and John Romero had done like far more of this

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:00.920
where he had done one of his teaching himself efforts

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.440
was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.280
It's that sense of like,

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.280
I'm just gonna go make 26 different games,

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.720
give them a different theme.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:10.360
And you learn so much when you go through

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.200
and you crank these things out,

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.600
like on a bi-weekly monthly basis,

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.000
something like that. From start to finish.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.920
So it's not like just an idea,

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:21.800
it's not just from the very beginning to the very end.

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.880
It's done.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.340
It has to be done.

01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.360
There's no delaying.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.200
It's done.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.040
And you've got deadlines.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.040
And that kind of rapid iteration pressure cooker environment

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.400
was super important for all of us developing the skills

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.560
that brought us to where we eventually went to.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.080
I mean, people would say like,

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.240
in the history of the Beatles,

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:43.160
like it wasn't them being the Beatles,

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.120
it was them playing all of these other early works

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.400
that that opportunity to craft all of their skills

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.880
before they were famous,

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:53.080
that was very critical to their later successes.

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.000
And I think there's a lot of that here

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.800
where we did these games that nobody remembers,

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:01.040
lots of little things that contributed

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:02.440
to building up the skill set

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:05.400
for the things that eventually did make us famous.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:06.240
And-

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.400
And Dostoevsky wrote The Gambler.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:12.520
I had to write it in a month, just to make money.

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:14.680
And nobody remembers that probably.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:15.920
Cause he had to figure out,

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:17.240
cause it's literally,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.160
he didn't have enough time to write it fast enough.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:23.080
So he had to come up with hacks.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:23.920
Literally, write it fast enough.

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.240
It again comes down to that point

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.280
where pressure and limitation of resources

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.360
is surprisingly important.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.600
And it's counterintuitive in a lot of ways

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.440
where you just think that

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.920
if you've got all the time in the world

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.600
and you've got all the resources in the world,

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.440
of course you're going to get something better.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.080
But sometimes it really does work out that the innovations,

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.920
mother necessity, and you know, where you can,

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.760
resource constraints and you have to do things

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.320
when you don't have a choice,

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.760
it's surprising what you can do.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.800
Is there any good games written in that time?

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.640
Would you say-

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.720
Some of them are still fun to go back and play

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.240
where you get the,

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.000
they were all about kind of the more modern term

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.160
is game feel about how just the exact feel that things,

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:06.280
it's not the grand strategy of the design,

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.880
but how running and jumping and shooting

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:12.000
and those things I feel in the moment.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.640
And some of those are still,

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.640
if you sat down on them,

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.120
you kind of go, it's a little bit different.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.800
It doesn't have the same movement feel,

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.840
but you move over and you're like, bang, jump, bang.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.240
It's like, hey, that's kind of cool still.

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.320
So you can get lost in the rhythm of the game.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.880
Like the, is that what you mean by feel?

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.440
Just like there's something about it that pulls you in.

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.880
Nowadays, again, people talk about compulsion loops

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.120
and things where it's that,

01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:37.960
that sense of exactly what you're doing,

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.680
what your fingers are doing on the keyboard,

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.200
what your eyes are seeing.

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:43.360
And there are going to be these sequences of things,

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.880
grab the loot, shoot the monster,

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.040
jump over the obstacle, get to the end of the level.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.680
These are eternal aspects of game design in a lot of ways,

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.360
but there are better and worse ways to do all of them.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.720
And we did so many of these games that it was,

01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:58.840
we got a lot of practice with it.

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:01.080
So one of the kind of weird things

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.480
that was happening at this time

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:06.800
is John Romero was getting some strange fan mail.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.160
And back in the days, this was before email.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.360
So we literally got letters sometimes

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:12.680
and telling him, it's like,

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.360
oh, I want to talk to you about your games.

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:17.080
I want to reach out different things.

01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.880
And eventually it turned out that these were all coming

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.960
from Scott Miller at Apogee Software.

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.280
And he was reaching out through,

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.280
he didn't think he could contact John directly,

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.520
that he would get intercepted.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.720
So he was trying to get him to contact him

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:34.240
through like back channel fan mail

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.440
because he basically was saying,

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:38.560
hey, I'm making all this money on shareware games.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.840
I want you to make shareware games

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.600
because he had seen some of the games

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.480
that Romero had done.

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:47.800
And we looked at Scott Miller's games

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.480
and we didn't think they were very good.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.080
We're like, that can't be making the kind of money

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:56.240
that he's saying he's making 10 grand or something

01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.160
off of this game.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.400
And we really thought that he was full of shit,

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:03.120
that it was a lie trying to get him into this.

01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:07.000
But so that was kind of going on at one level.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.120
He was, and it was funny the moment

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.520
when Romero realized that he had some of these letters

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.560
pinned up on his wall, like all of his fans.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.400
And then we noticed that they all had the same return

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.360
address with different names on them,

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.960
which was a little bit of a two-edged sword there.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:23.440
Trying to figure out the puzzle laid out before him.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.680
Yeah, what happened after I kind of coincident with that

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.880
was I was working on a lot of the new technologies

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:33.880
where I was now full on the IBM PC for the first time,

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.240
where I was really a long holdout on Apple II forever.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.000
And I loved my Apple II.

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:40.720
It was the computer I always wished I had

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:41.760
when I was growing up.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.200
And when I finally did have one,

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.120
I was kind of clinging onto that well past

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.520
it's sort of good use by day.

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.800
Is it the best computer ever made, you would just say?

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.200
I wouldn't make judgments like that about it,

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:54.760
but it was positioned in such a way,

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.320
especially in the school systems,

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:59.960
that it impacted a whole lot of American programmers,

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.200
at least, where there was programs

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.080
that the Apple IIs got into the schools

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.040
and they had enough capability

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.800
that lots of interesting things happened with them.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:09.840
In Europe, it was different.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.440
You had your Amigas and Ataris

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:16.080
and acorns in the UK and things that had different things.

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.040
But in the United States,

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.720
it was probably the Apple II made the most impact

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.320
for a lot of programmers of my generation.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:26.080
But so I was really digging into the IBM.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:29.360
And this was even more so with the total focus,

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.760
because I had moved to another city

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.880
where I didn't know anybody that I wasn't working with.

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.080
I had a little apartment.

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:36.880
And then at Softdisk, again,

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:38.800
the things that drew me to it,

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.280
I had a couple programmers that knew more than I did,

01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:43.560
and they had a library.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:46.040
They had a set of books and a set of magazines.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:47.680
They had a couple years of magazines,

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:49.200
the old Dr. Dobbs Journal,

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.720
and all of these magazines

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:53.120
that had information about things.

01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:56.480
And so I was just in total immersion mode.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.480
It was eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming,

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:03.280
particularly the IBM for everything that I was doing.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:05.040
And I was digging into a lot of these

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.560
low-level hardware details

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.880
that people weren't usually paying attention to,

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:13.120
the way the IBM EGA cards worked,

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.320
which was fun for me.

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.960
I hadn't had experience with things at that level.

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.080
And back then, you could get hardware documentation

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.480
just down at the register levels.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.960
This is where the CRTC register is.

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.080
This is how the color registers work

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.920
and how the different things are applied.

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.280
And they were designed for a certain reason.

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.920
They were designed for an application.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.280
They had an intended use in mind,

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.280
but I was starting to look at other ways

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.720
that they could perhaps be exploited

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:40.720
that they weren't initially intended for.

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.760
Could you comment on, first of all,

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.040
what operating system was there?

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:45.880
What instructions set was it?

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.600
Like, what are we talking about?

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.520
So this was DOS and x86.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.760
So 16-bit 8086.

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.480
The 286s were there, and 386s existed.

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.880
They were rare.

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:59.400
We had a couple for our development systems.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:02.760
But we were still targeting the more broad,

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.960
it was all DOS 16-bit.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:07.600
None of this was kind of DOS extenders and things.

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.440
How different is it from the systems of today?

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.400
Is it kind of a precursor that's similar?

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.240
Very little.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:17.720
If you open up command.exe or com on Windows,

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.760
you see some of the remnants of all of that,

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.080
but it was a different world.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.840
It was the 640K is enough world,

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.640
and nothing was protected.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.760
It crashed all the time.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.960
You had TSRs or terminate and stay resident hacks

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:33.200
on top of things that would cause configuration problems.

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.560
All the hardware was manually configured in your auto exec.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.600
So it was a very different world, but-

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.440
The code is still the same, similar.

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:42.640
You could still write it.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.720
My earliest code there was written in Pascal.

01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.800
That was what I had learned kind of at an earlier point.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.240
So between BASIC and C++, there was Pascal.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.600
So when BASIC assembly language,

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.680
some of my intermediate stuff was,

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.120
well, you had to for performance.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.440
BASIC was just too slow.

01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:01.760
So most of the work that I was doing as a contract programmer

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:05.160
in my teenage years was assembly language.

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.320
Wait, you wrote games in assembly?

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.800
Yeah, complete games in assembly language.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.760
And it's thousands and thousands of lines

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:16.120
of three-letter acronyms for the instructions.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:19.480
That's, you don't earn the once again,

01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:21.120
greatest programmer ever label

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.160
without being able to write a game in assembly.

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.000
Okay.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.040
That's again, everybody wrote their,

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.400
everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:28.240
It was kind of a-

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.080
Everybody serious.

01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:29.920
You see what he said?

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:31.240
Everybody serious.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:34.000
It was an outlier to use Pascal a little bit

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.440
where there was one famous program called Wizardry.

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.520
It was like one of the great early role-playing games

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.920
that was written in Pascal,

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.520
but it was almost nothing used Pascal there.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.200
But I did learn Pascal.

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.040
And I remember doing all of my,

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.280
like to this day, I sketch in data structures.

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.640
When I'm thinking about something,

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.480
I'll open up a file and I'll start writing

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.960
struct definitions for how data is gonna be laid out.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.960
And Pascal was kind of formative to that

01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:01.160
because I remember designing my RPGs

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.080
in Pascal record structures and things like that.

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.800
And so I had gotten the Pascal compiler

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.760
for the Apple IIGS that I could work on.

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:12.480
And the first IBM game that I developed, I did in Pascal.

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.120
And that's actually kind of an interesting story again,

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.960
talking about the constraints and resources

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:20.000
where I had an Apple IIGS.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.520
I didn't have an IBM PC.

01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:24.600
I wanted to port my applications to IBM

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.040
because I thought I could make more money on it.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:31.640
So what I wound up doing is I rented a PC for a week

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:34.000
and bought a copy of Turbo Pascal.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
And so I had a hard one week

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.280
and this was cutting into what minimal profit margin

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.400
I had there, but I had this computer for a week.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.280
I had to get my program ported

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.840
before I had to return the PC.

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:47.400
And that was kind of the first thing that I had done

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:51.680
on the IBM PC and what led me to taking the job at SoftDisk.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.280
And Turbo Pascal, how's that different from regular Pascal?

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.440
Is it a different compiler or something like that?

01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:58.680
It was a product of Borland,

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:01.040
which before Microsoft kind of killed them,

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:04.240
they were the hot stuff developer tools company.

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:08.040
Yeah, Borland, Turbo Pascal, Turbo C, and Turbo Prolog.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.620
I mean, all the different things.

01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:12.860
But what they did was they took a supremely pragmatic

01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:14.580
approach of making something useful.

01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:16.240
It was one of these great examples

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.880
where Pascal was an academic language

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:21.820
and you had things like the UCSDP system

01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:23.800
that Wizardry was actually written in

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.080
that they did manage to make a game with that.

01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:30.900
But it was not a super practical system.

01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:33.540
While Turbo Pascal was, it was called Turbo

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.560
because it was blazingly fast to compile.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:39.460
I mean, really ridiculously 10 to 20 times faster

01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:41.640
than most other compilers at the time.

01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:44.120
But it also had very pragmatic access to,

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:45.860
look, you can just poke at the hardware

01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:46.840
in these different ways.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.240
And we have libraries that let you do things.

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.360
And it was a pretty good,

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:52.480
it was a perfectly good way to write games.

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:53.680
And this is one of those things

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.480
where people have talked about different paths

01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:58.640
that computer development could have taken

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:01.920
where C took over the world for reasons

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.400
that came out of Unix and eventually Linux.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:07.240
And that was not a foregone conclusion at all.

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.840
And people can make real reasoned, rational arguments

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.440
that the world might've been better

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.420
if it had gone a Pascal route.

01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:16.300
I'm somewhat agnostic on that

01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.620
where I do know from experience,

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:21.260
it was perfectly good enough to do that.

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:23.180
And it had some fundamental improvements,

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:26.100
like it had range checked arrays as an option there,

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:29.620
which could avoid many of C's real hazards

01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:31.560
that happened in a security space.

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.660
But C1, they were basically operating

01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.580
at about the same level of abstraction.

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:38.260
It was a systems programming language.

01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:39.100
But-

01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.380
But you said Pascal had more emphasis on data structures.

01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:44.980
Actually, in the tree of languages,

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:47.660
did the Pascal come before C?

01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:48.500
Did it inspire a lot of-

01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:49.700
They were pretty contemporaneous.

01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:53.420
So Pascal's lineage went to Modula 2 and eventually Oberon,

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:55.340
which was another Nicholas word,

01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:58.780
kind of experimental language.

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:01.420
But they were all good enough at that level.

01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:04.360
Now, some of the classic academic oriented Pascals

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.860
were just missing fundamental things like,

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:08.100
oh, you can't access this core system thing

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:10.360
because we're just using it to teach students.

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:14.040
But Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes to it

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.120
really did make it a completely capable language.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:19.640
And it had some reasons why you could implement it

01:40:19.640 --> 01:40:21.000
as a single pass compiler.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.560
So it could be way, way faster,

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.480
although less scope for optimizations

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.320
if you do it that way.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.360
And it did have some range checking options.

01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.800
It had a little bit better typing capability.

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.200
You'd have properly typed enums sorts of things

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.260
and other stuff that C lacked.

01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:37.920
But C was also clearly good enough.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.720
And it wound up with a huge inertia

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.800
from the Unix ecosystem and everything that came with that.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.040
Garbage collection?

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.480
No, it was not garbage collected.

01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.540
It's the same kind of thing as C.

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.380
Same manual.

01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:49.160
So you could still have your use after freeze

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:50.400
and all those other problems.

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.860
But just getting rid of array overruns,

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:56.160
at least if you were compiled with that debugging option,

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:58.400
certainly would have avoided a lot of problems

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.280
and could have a lot of benefits.

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.160
So anyways, that was the next thing I had to learn C

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.480
because C was where it seemed like

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.080
most of the things were going.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.640
So I abandoned Pascal and I started working in C.

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:11.680
I started hacking on these hardware things,

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:16.120
dealing with the graphics controllers and the EGA systems

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:18.280
and what we most wanted to do.

01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.620
So at that time we had,

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:22.320
we were sitting in our darkened office

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.800
playing all the different console video games

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.140
and we were figuring out what do we want to kind of,

01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:28.380
what games do we want to make

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:30.600
for our gamer's edge product there?

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:34.280
And so we had one of the first super Nintendos sitting there

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:37.600
and we had an older Nintendo looking at all those games.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.680
And the core thing that those consoles did

01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:41.960
that you just didn't get on the PC games

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:44.880
was this ability to have a massive scrolling world

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.040
where most of the games that you would make on the PC

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.520
and earlier personal computers would be a static screen.

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.840
You move little things around on it

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:55.040
and you interact like that.

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:58.320
Maybe you go to additional screens as you move,

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:01.920
but arcade games and consoles had this wonderful ability

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.560
to just have a big world

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.200
that you're slowly moving your window through.

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:08.480
And that was for those types of games,

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:10.840
the kind of action exploration adventure games

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:13.160
that was a super, super important thing.

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.280
And PC games just didn't do that.

01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.160
And what I had had come across

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.880
was a couple of different techniques

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:22.120
for implementing that on the PC.

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.200
And they're not hard, complicated things.

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.160
When I explain them now, they're pretty straightforward,

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:29.280
but just nobody was doing.

01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.920
You sound like Einstein describing his five papers

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.120
is pretty straightforward.

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.000
I understand, but they're nevertheless revolution.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.480
So size scrolling is a game changer.

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.200
Yeah, scrolling is a genius invention.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.600
Whether it's side or vertical.

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.680
And some of the consoles had different limitations

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.440
about you could do one but not the other.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:48.400
And there were similar things going on as advancements

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.640
even in the console space where you'd have

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:53.040
like the original Mario game was

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.600
like just horizontal scrolling.

01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:57.360
And then later Mario games added vertical aspects to it

01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.280
and different things that you were doing to explore,

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.000
kind of expand the capabilities there.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.520
And so much of the early game design for decades

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.680
was removing limitations,

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:10.160
letting you do things that you envisioned as a designer,

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:12.040
you wanted the player to experience,

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.400
but the hardware just couldn't really,

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.640
or you didn't know how to make it happen.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.760
It felt impossible.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:22.040
You can imagine that you wanna create like this big world

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.000
through which you can side scroll,

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.720
like through which you can walk.

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.480
And then you ask yourself a question,

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:31.920
how do I actually build that in a way that's

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.920
like the latency is low enough,

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.400
the hardware can actually deliver that

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.880
in such a way that it's a compelling experience.

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.440
Yeah, and we knew what we wanted to do

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.760
because we were playing all of these console games,

01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:45.200
playing all these Nintendo games and arcade games.

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:47.520
Clearly there was a whole world of awesome things there

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.440
that we just couldn't do on the PC, at least initially.

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.920
Because every programmer can tell,

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:53.960
it's like if you wanna scroll,

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:55.520
you could just redraw the whole screen.

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.480
But then it turns out,

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:58.880
well, you're going five frames per second.

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:01.040
That's not an interactive fun experience.

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.840
You wanna be going 30 or 60 frames per second or something.

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.920
And it just didn't feel like that was possible.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.080
It felt like the PCs had to get five times faster

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:12.720
for you to make a playable game there.

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.680
And interestingly, I wound up

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.960
with two completely different solutions

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.840
for the scrolling problem.

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.880
And this is a theme that runs through everything

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:25.320
where all of these big technical advancements,

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.360
it turns out there's always a couple different ways

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:28.440
of doing them.

01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:31.720
And it's not like you found the one true way of doing it.

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.240
And we'll see this as we go into 3D games and things later.

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:36.800
But so the scrolling,

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.800
the first set of scrolling tricks that I got was,

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:43.600
the hardware had this ability to,

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:47.640
you could shift like inside the window of memory.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:51.920
So the EGA cards at the time had 256 kilobytes of memory.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:55.360
And it was awkwardly set up in this planar format

01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:00.360
where instead of having 256 or 24 million colors,

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:03.400
you had 16 colors, which is four bits.

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.280
So you had four bit planes, 64K a piece.

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:10.400
Of course, 64K is a nice round number for 16 bit addressing.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:13.880
So your graphics card had a 16 bit window

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:15.200
that you could look at.

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:17.880
And you could tell it to start the video scan out

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:19.360
anywhere inside there.

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:22.160
So there were a couple games that had taken this approach.

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:25.760
If you could make a two by two screen or a one by four screen

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.120
and you could do scrolling really easily like that.

01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.720
You could just lay it all out

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.080
and just pan around there,

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:32.680
but you just couldn't make it any bigger

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:35.600
because that's all the memory that was there.

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:38.280
The first insight to the scrolling that I had was,

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:42.560
well, if we make a screen that's just one tile larger,

01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.840
we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels by 16 pixels,

01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.960
the little classic Mario block that you run into,

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.920
lots of art gets drawn that way.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.880
And your screen is a certain number of tiles.

01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:56.720
But if you had one little buffer region outside of that,

01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.960
you could easily pan around inside that 16 pixel region

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.840
and that could be perfectly smooth.

01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:04.040
But then what happens if you get to the edge

01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.000
and you wanna keep going?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.880
The first way we did scrolling

01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:10.800
was what I called adaptive tile refresh,

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:13.720
which was really just a matter of you get to the edge

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.160
and then you go back to the original point

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:19.440
and then only change the tiles that have actually,

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:21.640
that are different between where it was.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.280
In most of the games at the time,

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.320
if you think about sort of your classic

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:26.960
Super Mario Brothers game,

01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:30.040
you've got big fields of blue sky,

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:33.400
long rows of the same brick texture.

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.000
And there's a lot of commonality.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:36.600
It's kind of like a data compression thing.

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.920
If you take the screen

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:40.240
and you set it down on top of each other,

01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.360
in general, only about 10% of the tiles

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.200
were actually different there.

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.040
So this was a way to go ahead and say,

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:49.200
well, I'm gonna move it back

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:52.240
and then I'm only going to change those 10, 20,

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.160
whatever percent tiles there.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:57.560
And that meant that it was essentially five times faster

01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:59.920
than if you were redrawing all of the tiles.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:01.680
And that worked well enough for us to do

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:04.880
a bunch of these games for Gamers Edge.

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:06.320
We had a lot of these scrolling games

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:09.280
like Slurred Axe and Shadow Knights and things like that,

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.280
that we were cranking out at this high rate

01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.640
that had this scrolling effect on it.

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:14.640
And it worked well enough.

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.120
There were design challenges there

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:18.200
where if you made the worst case,

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.520
if you made a checkerboard over the entire screen,

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.240
you scroll over one and every single tile changes

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.120
and your frame rates now five frames per second

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.160
because it had to redraw everything.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.720
So the designers had a little bit

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:29.840
that they had to worry about.

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:32.840
They had to make these relatively plain looking levels,

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.880
but it was still pretty magical.

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.520
It was something that we hadn't seen before.

01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:41.360
And the first thing that we wound up doing with that

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:43.720
was I had just gotten this working

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:46.320
and Tom Hall was sitting there with me

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:49.240
and we were looking over at our Super Nintendo

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.560
on the side there with Super Mario 3 running.

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:56.360
And we had the technology, we had the tool set up there

01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:57.880
and we stayed up all night

01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:59.880
and we basically cloned the first level

01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.360
of Super Mario Brothers.

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.520
Performance wise as well?

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:05.120
Yeah, and we had our little character running

01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:05.960
and jumping in there.

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:08.840
It was close to pixel accurate

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.320
as far as all of the backgrounds and everything,

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.560
but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled together

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.360
from previous games that I had written.

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:18.080
I just kind of like really kitbashed the whole thing together

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:19.520
to make this demo.

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.920
And that was one of the rare cases when I said

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:24.920
I don't usually do these all night programming things.

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.920
There's probably only two memorable ones

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.600
that I can think about.

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:30.680
One was the all nighter to go ahead

01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:34.520
and get our Dangerous Dave in copyright infringement

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:35.480
is how we titled it.

01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:37.160
Because we had a game called Dangerous Dave

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.440
was running around with the shotgun shooting things

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.520
and we were just taking our most beloved game

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:44.920
at the time there, the Super Mario 3

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.840
and sort of sticking Dave inside that

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.760
with this new scrolling technology

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:53.760
that was going perfectly smooth for them as it ran.

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.680
And Tom and I just kind of blearily the next morning

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.240
kind of left and we left a disc on the desk

01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.720
for John Romero and Jay Wilbur to see

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:05.360
and just said run this.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.480
And we eventually made it back in later in the day

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.280
and it was like they grabbed us and pulled us into the room

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.720
and that was the point where they were like,

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.200
we gotta do something with this.

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.320
We're gonna make a company.

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:21.320
We're gonna go make our own games

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.000
where this was something that we were able

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.400
to just kind of hit them with a hammer of an experience

01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.760
like, wow, this is just like so much cooler

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.760
than what we thought was possible there.

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.920
And initially we tried to get Nintendo

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:36.880
to let us make Super Mario 3 on the PC.

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.440
That's really what we wanted to do.

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:40.240
We were like, hey, we can finish this.

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.720
It's line of sight for this will be great.

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:45.200
And we sent something to Nintendo

01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:48.240
and we heard that it did get looked at in Japan

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:50.760
and they just weren't interested in that.

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:51.800
But that's another one of those,

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.520
life could have gone a very different way

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:57.720
where we could have been like Nintendo's house PC team

01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:58.560
at that point.

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.320
And define the direction of,

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:06.720
Wolfenstein and Doom and Quake

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:09.000
could have been a Nintendo creation.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.760
Yeah, so at the same time

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:14.480
that we were just doing our first scrolling demos,

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:17.240
we reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:20.200
and said, it's like, hey, we do wanna make some games.

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.680
These things that you think you want, those are nothing.

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:24.560
What do you see what we can actually do now?

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:26.280
This is gonna be amazing.

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:29.360
And he just like popped right up and sent a check to us

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.600
where at that point we still thought he might be a fraud,

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:34.520
that he was just lying about all of this,

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.560
but he was totally correct on how much money he was making

01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.440
with his shareware titles.

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:43.200
And this was his kind of real brainstorm about this

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.000
where shareware was this idea

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.240
that software doesn't have a fixed price.

01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:49.880
If you use it, you send out of the goodness of your heart

01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.720
some money to the creator.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:53.320
And there were a couple of utilities

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:55.960
that did make some significant success like that.

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:58.480
But for the most part, it didn't really work.

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.600
Now there wasn't much software in a pure shareware model

01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.880
that was successful.

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.720
The Apogee innovation was to take something,

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:10.160
call it shareware, split it into three pieces.

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.200
You always made a trilogy

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:14.400
and you would put the first piece out,

01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.200
but then you buy the whole trilogy

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:18.400
for some shareware amount,

01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:21.320
which in reality it meant that the first part was a demo

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.080
where you kind of like the demo went everywhere for free

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:26.640
and you paid money to get the whole set,

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:28.680
but it was still played as shareware

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.120
and we were happy to have the first one go everywhere.

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:32.520
And it wasn't a crippled demo

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:35.000
where the first episode of all of these trilogies,

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.440
it was a real complete game

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:39.880
and probably 20 times as many people played that part of it,

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:41.240
thought they had a great game,

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:45.440
had fond memories of it, but never paid us a dime.

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:48.240
But enough people were happy with that

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:50.720
where it was really quite successful.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:53.240
And these early games that we didn't think very much of

01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:55.800
compared to commercial quality games,

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.800
but they were doing really good business,

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:01.360
some fairly crude things and people, it was good business.

01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:04.080
People enjoyed it and it wasn't like you were taking

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:05.560
a crap shoot on what you were getting.

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.760
You just played a third of the experience

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.840
and you loved it enough to handwrite out a check

01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:13.120
and put it in an envelope and address it

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:16.600
and send it out to Apogee to get the rest of them.

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:20.600
So it was a really pretty feel good business prospect there

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.120
because everybody was happy.

01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:25.080
They knew what they were getting.

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:27.160
When they sent it in, they would send in fan mail.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:29.480
If you're going to the trouble of addressing a letter

01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:32.640
and filling out an envelope, you write something in it

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.360
and there were just the literal bags of fan mail

01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:38.920
for the shareware games, so people loved them.

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:42.560
I should mention that for you, the definition of wealth

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:46.600
is being able to have pizza whenever you want.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:49.040
For me, there was a dream,

01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:51.400
because I would play shareware games over and over,

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.840
the part that's free over and over

01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:56.520
and it was a very deeply fulfilling experience,

01:52:56.520 --> 01:53:01.200
but I dreamed of a time when I could actually afford

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.920
the full experience and this is kind of this dreamland

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.320
beyond the horizon when you could find out

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.400
what else is there.

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.920
In some sense, even just playing the shareware

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:18.280
was the limitation of that.

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:21.520
Life is limited, eventually we all die.

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:26.520
In that way, shareware was somehow really fulfilling

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.920
to have this kind of mysterious thing

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:32.200
beyond what's free always there.

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:35.720
It's kind of, I don't know, maybe it's because a part

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.600
of my childhood is playing the shareware games.

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:39.520
That was a really fulfilling experience.

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:43.120
It's so interesting how that model still brought joy

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:46.000
to so many people, the 20X people that played it.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.360
I felt very good about that.

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:49.680
I would run into people that would say,

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:52.240
oh, I loved that game that you had early on,

01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:55.920
Commander Keen, whatever, and no,

01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:57.520
they meant just the first episode

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.680
that they got to see everywhere.

01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:01.120
That's me, I played the crap out of Commander Keen,

01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.240
the shareware.

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:05.800
That was all good, but so we were in this position

01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:08.200
where Scott Miller was just fronting us cash

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.400
and saying, yeah, make a game,

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:14.120
but we did not properly pull the trigger and say,

01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:16.360
all right, we're going to, we're quitting our jobs.

01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:17.920
We were like, we're gonna do both.

01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:21.240
We're gonna keep working at Softdisk, working on this,

01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:23.200
and then we're going to go ahead

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:27.040
and make a new game for Apogee at the same time.

01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:29.560
And this eventually did lead to some legal problems,

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.080
and we had trouble.

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:32.800
It all got worked out in the end,

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:35.880
but it was not a good call at the time there.

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:39.440
And your legal mind at the time was not stellar.

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:42.360
You were not thinking in terms of the legal terms.

01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:44.040
No, I definitely wasn't.

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:47.400
None of us were, and in hindsight, yeah,

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:49.440
it's like, how did we think we were going to get away with

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:52.760
even using our work computers to write software

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:56.840
for our breakaway new company?

01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:58.400
It was not a good plan.

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:01.000
How did Commander Keen come to be?

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.120
So the design process, we would start from,

01:55:04.120 --> 01:55:05.960
we had some idea of what we wanted to do.

01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:08.360
We wanted to do a Mario-like game.

01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:10.200
It was going to be a side-scroller.

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.840
It was going to use the technology.

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:14.360
We had some sense of what it would have to look like

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.560
because of the limitations

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:18.000
of this adaptive tile refresh technology.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.280
It had to have fields of relatively constant tiles.

01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.520
You couldn't just paint up a background

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:25.040
and then move that around.

01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:28.640
The early design, or all the design for Commander Keen

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.080
really came from Tom Hall,

01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.880
where he was kind of the main creative mind

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.960
for the early id software stuff,

01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:39.080
where we had an interesting division of things

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:42.240
where Tom was all creative in design.

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:43.600
I was all programming.

01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.560
John Romero was an interesting bridge

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:47.720
where he was both a very good programmer

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:50.160
and also a very good designer and artist

01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:52.480
and kind of straddled between the areas.

01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:55.560
But Commander Keen was very much Tom Hall's baby.

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:59.320
And he came up with all the design and backstory

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:02.320
for the different things of kind of a mad scientist

01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:07.320
little kid with building a rocket ship and a zap gun

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:10.800
and visiting alien worlds and doing all of this,

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:13.640
the background that we lay the game inside of.

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:16.760
And there's not a whole lot to any of these things.

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:19.560
Design for us was always just what we needed to do

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:23.080
to make the game that was going to be so much fun to play.

01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:26.800
And we laid out our first trilogy of games,

01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:29.480
the shareware formula was going to be three pieces.

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:31.760
We make Commander Keen one, two, and three.

01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:35.840
And we just really started busting on all that work.

01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:37.680
And it went together really quickly.

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:39.600
It was like three months or something

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.960
that while we were still making games every month

01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:45.480
for Gamers Edge, we were sharing technology between that.

01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:46.840
I'd write a bunch of code for this

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:48.840
and we just kind of use it for both.

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:50.880
Again, not a particularly good idea there

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:53.040
that had consequences for us.

01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.200
But in three months, we got our first game out

01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:00.640
and all of a sudden it was three times as successful

01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:03.040
as the most successful thing Apogee had had before.

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:07.080
And we were making like $30,000 a month immediately

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:09.080
from the Commander Keen stuff.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:11.720
And that was, again, a surprise to us.

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:15.280
It was more than we thought that that was going to make.

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.320
And we said, well, we're going to certainly roll

01:57:17.320 --> 01:57:19.960
into another set of titles from this.

01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:21.800
And in that three months, I had come up

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:24.880
with a much better way of doing the scrolling technology

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:27.200
that was not the adaptive tile refresh,

01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:29.200
which in some ways was even simpler.

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.440
And these things, so many of the great ideas of technology

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.320
are things that are back of the envelope designs.

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:38.400
I make this comment about modern machine learning

01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.800
where all the things that are really important

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.720
practically in the last decade are,

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.480
each of them fits on the back of an envelope.

01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:46.360
There are these simple little things.

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:51.360
They're not super dense, hard to understand technologies.

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.880
And so the second scrolling trick

01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:55.080
was just a matter of like,

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:58.560
okay, we know we've got this 64K window.

01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:00.040
And the question was always like,

01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:02.240
well, you could make a two by two,

01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:05.480
but you can't go off the edge.

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:07.800
But I finally asked, well, what actually happens

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:09.600
if you just go off the edge?

01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:12.280
If you take your start and you say, it's like,

01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.440
okay, I can move over, I'm scrolling.

01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:16.920
I can move over, I can move down, I'm scrolling.

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:19.760
I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window.

01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:21.600
It's like, well, what if I just keep going?

01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:24.000
And I say, I'm gonna start at,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.360
what happens if I start at FFFE

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:29.360
at the very end of the 64K block?

01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:31.920
And it turns out it just wraps back around

01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:33.240
to the top of the block.

01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.800
And I'm like, oh, well, this makes everything easy.

01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:37.600
You can just scroll the screen everywhere

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:40.400
and all you have to draw is just one new line of tiles,

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.040
whichever thing you expose.

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.640
It might be unaligned off various parts

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:48.120
of the screen memory, but it just works.

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.840
That no longer had the problem of,

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:52.200
you had to have fields of the similar colors

01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:54.280
because it doesn't matter what you're doing.

01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:56.840
You could be having a completely unique world

01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:59.440
and you're just drawing the new strip as it comes on.

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.200
But it might be, like you said, unaligned

01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.720
so it can be all over the place.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:04.960
And it turns out it doesn't matter.

01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:06.680
I would have two page flipped screens

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.000
as long as they didn't overlap.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.400
They moved in series through this

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:12.920
two dimensional window of graphics.

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:15.720
And that was one of those like, well, this is so simple.

01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:17.880
This just works.

01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:19.400
It's faster.

01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:21.760
There it seemed like there was no downside.

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:24.240
Funny thing was it turned out

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:26.360
after we shipped titles with this,

01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:29.640
there were what they called super VGA cards,

01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:31.920
the cards that would allow higher resolutions

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:35.720
and different features that the standard ones didn't.

01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:38.320
And on some of those cards,

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.360
this was a weird compatibility quirk again,

01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.720
because nobody thought this was not what it was designed

01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:43.560
to do.

01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:45.600
And some of those cards had more memory.

01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:48.800
They had more than just 256K in four planes.

01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:51.480
They had 512K or a megabyte.

01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:55.640
And on some of those cards, I scroll my window down

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:57.880
and then it goes into uninitialized memory

01:59:57.880 --> 01:59:59.040
that actually exists there

01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:01.760
rather than wrapping back around to the top.

02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:04.160
And then I was in the tough position

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:06.280
of do I have to track every single one of these?

02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:07.880
And it was a madhouse back then

02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:10.720
with there were 20 different video card vendors

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:12.680
with all slightly different implementations

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:14.840
of their non-standard functionality.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:17.560
So either I needed to natively program

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:22.080
all of the VGA cards there to map in that memory

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.320
and keep scrolling down through all of that.

02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:27.520
Or I kind of punted and took the easy solution of

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.280
when you finally did run to the edge of the screen,

02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:33.360
I accepted a hitch and just copied the whole screen up there.

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:38.320
So on some of those cards, it was a compatibility mode.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.160
In the normal ones, when it all worked fine,

02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:42.040
everything was just beautifully smooth.

02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:43.440
But if you had one of those cards

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:46.360
where it did not wrap the way I wanted it to,

02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.840
you'd be scrolling around, scrolling around,

02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:50.560
and then eventually you'd have a little hitch

02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:52.880
where 200 milliseconds or something

02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:54.680
that was not super smooth as it-

02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:56.080
Yeah, it froze a little bit.

02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.840
And this was the binary thing,

02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.640
is it one of the standard screens

02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:02.040
or is it one of the weird ones, the super VGA ones?

02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:03.040
Yeah. Okay.

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:04.480
And so we would default to,

02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.880
and I think that was one of those

02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:09.000
that changed over the kind of course of deployment

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.080
where early on we would have a normal mode

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:13.480
and then you would enable the compatibility flag

02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:16.120
if your screen did this crazy flickery thing

02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:18.640
when you got to a certain point in the game.

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:21.440
And then later, I think it probably got enabled by default

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:23.520
as just more and more of the cards

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:26.160
kind of did not do exactly the right thing.

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:27.520
And that's the two-edged sword

02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.320
of doing unconventional things with technology

02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:33.080
where you can find something that nobody thought about

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.520
doing that kind of scrolling trick

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.760
when they set up those cards.

02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:39.120
But the fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason

02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:40.840
when I was relying on that,

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:44.040
then I wound up being broken on some of the later cards.

02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:45.760
Let me take a bit of a tangent,

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:50.280
but ask you about the hacker ethic

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:51.800
because you mentioned shareware.

02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.200
It's an interesting world,

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:56.680
the world of people that make money,

02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.480
the business and the people that build systems,

02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:02.080
the engineers.

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:05.960
And what is the hacker ethic?

02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:08.440
You've been a man of the people

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:12.480
and you've embodied at least the part of that ethic.

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.320
What does it mean?

02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:14.480
What did it mean to you at the time?

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.800
What does it mean to you today?

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.880
So Stephen Levy's book, Hackers,

02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:21.600
was a really formative book for me as a teenager.

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.640
I mean, I read it several times

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:25.960
and there was all of the great lore

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:28.960
of the early MIT era of hackers

02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:30.960
and ending up at the end with,

02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:34.080
it kind of went through the early MIT hackers

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:36.080
and then the Silicon Valley hardware hackers

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:39.400
and then the game hackers in part three.

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:41.680
And at that time as a teenager,

02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:44.480
I really was kind of bitter in some ways,

02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:46.280
like I thought I was born too late.

02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:48.960
I thought I missed the window there.

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:51.000
And I really thought I belonged

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.600
in that third section of that book with the game hackers.

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:56.760
And they were talking about the Williams at Sierra

02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:58.840
and Origin Systems with Richard Garriott.

02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:02.520
And it's like, I really wanted to be there.

02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.600
And I knew that was now a few years in the past.

02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:08.720
It was not to be.

02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:12.480
But the early days, especially the early MIT hacker days,

02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:16.080
talking a lot about this sense of the hacker ethic,

02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.920
that there was this sense that it was about

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:20.720
sharing information, being good,

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:22.440
not keeping it to yourself

02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:24.760
and that it's not a zero sum game,

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.400
that you can share something with another programmer

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.800
and it doesn't take it away from you.

02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:33.120
You then have somebody else doing something.

02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:35.960
And I also think that there's an aspect of it

02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:39.200
where it's this ability to take joy

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:41.240
in other people's accomplishments,

02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:43.040
where it's not the cutthroat bit of like,

02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:44.120
I have to be first.

02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.760
I have to be recognized as the one

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:48.240
that did this in some way.

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.600
But being able to see somebody else do something

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.680
and say, holy shit, that's amazing,

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.800
and just taking joy in the ability

02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:58.840
of something amazing that somebody else does.

02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:03.840
And the big thing that I was able to do through id Software

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:07.200
was this ability to eventually release the source code

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:10.760
for all of our really seminal game titles.

02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:13.680
And it was a stepping stone process

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:16.520
where we were kind of surprised early on

02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:20.160
where people were able to hack the existing games.

02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:21.560
And of course, I had experience with that.

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.520
I remember hacking my copies of Ultima.

02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:27.120
So I give myself 9999 gold and raise my levels

02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:29.080
and break out the sector editor.

02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:31.040
And so I was familiar with all of that.

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.240
So it was with a smile when I started to see people

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.640
doing that to our games.

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.960
I am making level editors for Commander Keen

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:41.840
or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D.

02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:44.960
But I made the pitch internally

02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:47.560
that we should actually release our own tools

02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:51.440
for like what we did, what we used to create the games.

02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:55.120
And that was a little bit debatable about,

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.920
well, we'll give people leg up.

02:04:57.920 --> 02:04:59.280
It's always like, what's that gonna mean

02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:00.960
for the competition?

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.760
But the really hard pitch was to actually release

02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:06.800
the full source code for the games.

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:10.360
And it was a balancing act with the other people

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:13.320
inside the company where it's interesting

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:17.080
how the programmers generally did get,

02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:20.360
certainly the people that I worked closely with,

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:22.600
they did kind of get that hacker ethic bit

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:24.680
where you wanted to share your code.

02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:25.920
You were proud of it.

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:28.960
You wanted other people to take it, do cool things with it.

02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:33.920
But interestingly, the broader game industry

02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:36.560
is a little more hesitant to embrace that

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:38.040
than like the group of people

02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:40.200
that we happen to have at id Software

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:42.560
where it was always a little interesting to me

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:45.640
seeing how a lot of people in the game modding community

02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:47.680
were very possessive of their code.

02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:49.360
They did not wanna share their code.

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:50.600
They wanted it to be theirs.

02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:52.680
It was their claim to fame.

02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.560
And that was much more like

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:56.280
what we tended to see with artists

02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:59.200
where the artists understand something about credit

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:02.240
and wanting it to be known as their work.

02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:05.360
And a lot of the game programmers

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:07.080
felt a little bit more like artists

02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:08.640
than like hacker programmers

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:11.040
in that it was about building something

02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:13.040
that maybe felt more like art to them

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:16.800
than the more tool-based and exploration-based

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.120
kind of hacking culture side of things.

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:23.760
It's so interesting that this kind of fear

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:27.880
that credit will not be sufficiently attributed to you.

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:30.400
And that's one of the things that I do bump into a lot

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:34.280
because I try not to go...

02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:35.400
I mean, it's easy for me to say

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:37.240
because so much credit is heaped on me

02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:39.360
for the id Software side of things.

02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:42.200
But when people come up and they wanna pick a fight

02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:43.600
and say, no, it's like that wasn't

02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:45.720
where first-person gaming came from.

02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:48.840
And you can point to some of like things

02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:51.600
on obscure titles that I was never aware of

02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:53.320
or like the old Play-Doh systems

02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:55.840
or each personal computer had something

02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:58.320
that was 3D-ish and moving around.

02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:00.960
And I'm happy to say it's like, no,

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:03.880
I mean, I saw Battlezone and Star Wars in the arcades.

02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:05.320
I had seen 3D graphics.

02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:06.800
I had seen all these things there.

02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:09.080
I'm standing on the shoulders of lots of other people,

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:10.880
but sometimes these examples they pull out,

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.520
it's like, no, I didn't know that existed.

02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:15.280
I mean, I had never heard of that before then.

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:17.800
That didn't contribute to what I made,

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:19.480
but there's plenty of stuff that did.

02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:23.280
And I think there's good cases to be made

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:26.160
that obviously Doom and Quake and Wolfenstein

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:31.160
were formative examples for everything that came after that.

02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:34.680
But I don't feel the need to go fight and say,

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:38.800
claim primacy or initial invention of anything like that.

02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:40.440
But a lot of people do want to.

02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:43.200
I think when you fight for the credit in that way

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:45.280
and it does go against the hacker ethic,

02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:48.840
you destroy something fundamental about the culture,

02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:51.840
about the community that builds cool stuff.

02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:53.840
I think credit ultimately,

02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:58.440
so I had this sort of,

02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:01.040
there's a famous wrestler and freestyle wrestling

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:04.040
called Buweisar Satya.

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:07.800
And he always preached that you should just focus

02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:09.520
on the art of the wrestling

02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:14.520
and let people write your story however they want.

02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:20.120
The highest form of the art is just focusing on the art.

02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:23.840
And that is something about the hacker ethic

02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.960
is just focus on building cool stuff,

02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:29.440
sharing it with other cool people.

02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:32.600
And credit will get assigned correctly

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:37.320
in the long arc of history.

02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:39.280
Yeah, and I generally think that's true.

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:40.120
And you've got,

02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:44.280
there's some things, there's a graphics technique

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:46.320
that got labeled CarMax Reverse.

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:48.440
I'm literally named it.

02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:50.400
And it turned out that I wasn't the first person

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:51.920
to figure that out.

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:54.400
Most scientific things are mathematical things.

02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:56.240
You wind up, it's like, oh, this other person

02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:58.640
had actually done that somewhat before.

02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:00.360
And then there's things that get attributed to me,

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:02.040
like the inverse square root hack

02:09:02.040 --> 02:09:03.360
that I actually didn't do.

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:04.800
I flat out, that wasn't me.

02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:07.920
And it's weird how the mimetic power of the internet,

02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.760
I cannot convince people of that.

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:11.000
You're like the Mark Twain of programming.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.200
Yes.

02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:14.120
Everything just gets attributed to you now.

02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:17.280
Even though you've never sought the credit of things.

02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:21.240
I mean, but part of the fact that the humility behind that

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:24.120
is what attracts the attributions.

02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:27.840
Let's talk about a game.

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.560
I mean, one of the greatest games ever made.

02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:31.480
I know you could talk about doing Quake and so on.

02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:33.840
But to me, Wolfenstein 3D was like, whoa.

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:38.200
It blew my mind that a world like this could exist.

02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:40.880
So how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:44.280
in terms of the programming, in terms of the design,

02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.240
in terms of some of the memorable technical challenges?

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.640
And also actually just something you haven't mentioned

02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:55.640
is how did these ideas come to be inside your mind?

02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:00.680
The adaptive side scrolling,

02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:03.640
the solutions to these technical challenges.

02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:06.960
So I usually can introspectively pull back

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.440
pretty detailed accounts of how technology solutions

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:14.080
and design choices on my part came to be

02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:17.480
where technically we had done two games,

02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:19.280
3D games like that before,

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:21.040
where Hover Tank was the first one

02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:22.840
which had flat shaded walls

02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.320
but did have the scaled enemies inside it.

02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.040
And then Catacombs 3D,

02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.200
which had textured walls, scaled enemies,

02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:35.200
and some more functionality like the disappearing walls

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:37.160
and some other stuff.

02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:38.680
But what's really interesting

02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:42.000
from a game development standpoint is those games,

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.040
Catacombs 3D, Hover Tank, and Wolfenstein,

02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:48.240
they literally used the same code

02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:50.280
for a lot of the character behavior

02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:54.160
that a 2D game that I had made earlier called Catacombs did

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:56.720
where it was an overhead view game kind of like Gauntlet.

02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:58.800
You're running around and you can open up doors,

02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:01.280
pick up items, basic game stuff.

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:06.360
And the thought was that this exact same game experience

02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:09.120
just presented in a different perspective.

02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:11.400
It could be literally the same game

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.520
just with a different view into it

02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:16.920
would have a dramatically different impact on the players.

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:20.320
So it wasn't a true 3D.

02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:22.480
You're saying that you could kind of fake it.

02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:24.200
You can like scale enemies,

02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:25.760
meaning things that are farther away.

02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:27.480
You can make them smaller.

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:29.800
So from the game was a 2D map.

02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:33.080
Like all of our games use the same tool for creation.

02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:35.400
We use the same map editor for creating Keen

02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:37.960
as Wolfenstein and Hover Tank and Catacombs

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.120
and all this stuff.

02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:42.720
So the game was a 2D grid made out of blocks.

02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:44.520
And you could say, well, these are walls.

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:45.920
These are where the enemies start.

02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:47.720
Then they start moving around.

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:49.640
And these early games like Catacombs,

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:51.640
you played it strictly in a 2D view.

02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:53.280
It was a scrolling 2D view.

02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.360
And that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh

02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:58.480
at the time to be able to do something like that.

02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:01.640
And then the thought that these early games,

02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:04.640
all it did was take the same basic enemy logic,

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:07.720
but instead of seeing it from the God's eye view on top,

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:10.520
you were inside it and turning from side to side,

02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.120
yawing your view and moving forwards

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:14.560
and backwards and side to side.

02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:16.960
And it's a striking thing where you always talk

02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:20.120
about wanting to isolate and factor changes in values.

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:22.400
And this was one of those most pure cases there

02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:25.080
where the rest of the game changed very little.

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:27.880
It was our normal kind of change the colors on something

02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:29.240
and draw a different picture for it,

02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:30.920
but it's kind of the same thing.

02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:34.000
But the perspective changed in a really fundamental way.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.320
And it was dramatically different.

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.640
I can remember the reactions where the artist, Adrian,

02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:42.120
that had been drawing the pictures for it.

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.920
We had a cool big troll thing in Catacombs 3D.

02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:47.760
And we had these walls that you could get a key

02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:49.920
and you could make the blocks disappear.

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:51.040
Really simple stuff.

02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:52.960
Blocks could either be there or not there.

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:55.520
So our idea of a door was being able to make a set

02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:57.320
of blocks just disappear.

02:12:57.320 --> 02:12:59.440
And I remember the reaction where he had drawn

02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:01.760
these characters and he was slowly moving around.

02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:04.520
And people had no experience with 3D navigation.

02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:05.480
It was all still keyboard.

02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:08.520
We didn't even have mice set up at that time.

02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:12.320
But slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.360
The wall disappears in a little animation

02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:16.320
and there's a monster right there.

02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.000
And he practically fell out of his chair.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.280
It was just like, ah!

02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:22.480
And games just didn't do that.

02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:24.360
The games were the God's eye view.

02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.320
You were a little invested in your little guy.

02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:29.760
You can be happy or sad when things happen.

02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:32.480
But you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.

02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:33.920
You weren't inside the game.

02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.560
Something in the back of your brain,

02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:37.760
some reptile brain thing is just going,

02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:39.960
oh shit, something just happened.

02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.520
And that was one of those early points where it's like,

02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:44.800
yeah, this is gonna make a difference.

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:47.440
This is going to be powerful and it's gonna matter.

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:51.120
Were you able to imagine that in the idea stage or no?

02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:53.720
So not that exact thing.

02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:56.480
So again, we had cases like the arcade games,

02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:58.000
Battle Zone and Star Wars,

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.160
that you could kind of see a 3D world

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:03.480
and things coming at you and you get some sense of it,

02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:06.440
but nothing had done the kind of worlds that we were doing

02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.480
and the sort of action-based things.

02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:12.120
3D at the time was really largely

02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:14.240
about these simulation thoughts.

02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:16.840
And this is something that really might have

02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:20.280
trended differently if not for the id software approach

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:23.560
in the games where there were flight simulators,

02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:24.920
there were driving simulators,

02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:28.400
you had like hard drive-in and Microsoft Flight Simulator.

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:31.360
And these were doing 3D and general purpose 3D

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:33.760
in ways that were more flexible

02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:35.440
than what we were doing with our games,

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:38.000
but they were looked at as simulations.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.040
They weren't trying to necessarily be fast or responsive

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.840
or letting you do kind of exciting maneuvers

02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:46.800
because they were trying to simulate reality

02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:49.280
and they were taking their cues from the big systems,

02:14:49.280 --> 02:14:51.520
the Evans and Sutherlands and the silicon graphics

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.880
that were doing things.

02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:54.600
But we were taking our cues

02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:56.560
from the console and arcade games.

02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:59.480
We wanted things that were sort of quarter eaters

02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:01.160
that were doing fast-paced things

02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:02.800
that you could smack you around

02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:05.920
rather than just smoothly gliding you from place to place.

02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:07.640
Quarter eaters.

02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:08.880
Yeah.

02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.280
And the funny thing is so much that that built into us

02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:15.080
that Wolfenstein still had lives

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:16.560
and you had like one of the biggest power-ups

02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:18.800
in all these games like was an extra life

02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:20.560
because you started off with three lives

02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.080
and you lose your lives and then it's game over

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:26.240
and there weren't save games in most of this stuff.

02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:28.760
It was, it sounds almost crazy to say this,

02:15:28.760 --> 02:15:32.360
but it was an innovation in Doom to not have lives.

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:33.880
You could just play Doom as long as you wanted.

02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:36.760
You just restart at the start of the level and why not?

02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:39.760
This is, we aren't trying to take people's quarters.

02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:41.360
They've already paid for the entire game.

02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.360
We want them to have a good time

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:46.720
and you would have some old-timer purists

02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:48.960
that might think that there's something to the epic journey

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:50.840
of making it to the end, having to restart

02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:52.040
all the way from the beginning

02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:53.440
after a certain number of tries.

02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:56.360
But no, more fun is had when you just let people

02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:58.040
kind of keep trying when they're stuck

02:15:58.040 --> 02:15:59.760
rather than having to go all the way back

02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:01.920
and learn different things.

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:03.280
So you've recommended the book,

02:16:03.280 --> 02:16:05.720
Game Engine Black Book Wolfenstein 3D

02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:07.600
for technical exploration of the game.

02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:10.560
So looking back 30 years,

02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.240
what are some memorable technical innovations

02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:16.920
that made this perspective shift into this world

02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:18.560
that's so immersive that scares you

02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:20.160
when a monster appears?

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.280
Or some things you have to solve?

02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:25.000
So one of the interesting things that come back

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.760
to the theme of deadlines and resource constraints,

02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:30.040
the game Catacombs 3D,

02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:33.120
we shipped, we were supposed to be shipping this

02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:36.440
for Gamers Edge on a monthly cadence and I had slipped.

02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:37.840
I was actually late.

02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:39.240
It slipped like six weeks

02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:41.560
because this was texture mapped walls,

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:44.760
doing stuff that I hadn't done before.

02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:46.720
And at the six week point,

02:16:46.720 --> 02:16:48.960
it was still kind of glitchy and buggy.

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:51.560
There were things that I knew that if you had a wall

02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:54.560
that was like almost edge on, you could slide over to it

02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:56.560
and you could see some things freak out or vanish

02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:59.880
or not work and I hated that.

02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:01.480
But I was up against the wall.

02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:02.960
We had to ship the game.

02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:04.640
It was still a lot of fun to play.

02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:05.960
It was novel, nobody had seen it.

02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:09.000
It gave you that startle reflex reaction.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:12.480
So it was worth shipping, but it had these things

02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:14.520
that I knew were kind of flaky and janky

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:17.440
and not what I was really proud of.

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:20.720
So one of the things that I did very differently

02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:24.000
in Wolfenstein was I went,

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.200
Catacombs used almost a conventional thing

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:30.240
where you had segments that were one dimensional polygons

02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:33.080
basically that were clipped and back faced

02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:36.320
and done kind of like a very crude 3D engine

02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:39.520
from the professionals, but I wasn't getting it done right.

02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:41.520
I was not doing a good enough job.

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:45.520
I didn't really have line of sight to fix it right.

02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:46.920
There's stuff that, of course I look back,

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:48.640
it's like, oh, it's obvious how to do this

02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:51.000
and do the math right, do your clipping right,

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.280
check all of this, how you handle the precision,

02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:55.640
but I did not know how to do that at that time.

02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:59.120
Was that the first 3D engine you wrote, Catacombs 3D?

02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.880
Yeah, Hover Tank had been a little bit before that,

02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:02.480
but that had the flat shaded walls.

02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:04.560
So the texture mapping on the walls

02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:06.880
was what was bringing in some of these challenges

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:09.920
that was hard for me and I couldn't solve it

02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:11.120
right at the time.

02:18:11.720 --> 02:18:13.480
Can you describe what flat shading is and texture mapping?

02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:16.040
So in the walls were solid color,

02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:19.320
one of 16 colors in Hover Tank.

02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:20.840
So that's easy, it's fast,

02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:23.680
you just draw the solid color for everything.

02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:25.600
Texture mapping is what we all see today

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:28.120
where you have an image that is stretched and distorted

02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:31.040
onto the walls or the surfaces that you're working with.

02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:35.320
And it was a long time for me to just figure out

02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:38.600
how to do that without it distorting in the wrong ways.

02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:42.400
And I did not get it all exactly right in Catacombs

02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:44.880
and I had these flaws.

02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:46.800
So that was important enough to me

02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:49.400
that rather than continuing to bang my head on that

02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:51.840
when I wasn't positive I was gonna get it,

02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:53.480
I went with a completely different approach

02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.440
for drawing, for figuring out where the walls were,

02:18:56.440 --> 02:18:58.640
which was a ray casting approach,

02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:00.880
which I had done in Catacombs 3D,

02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:04.040
I had a bunch of C code trying to make this work right

02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:05.880
and it wasn't working right.

02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:09.920
In Wolfenstein I wound up going to a very small amount

02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:11.200
of assembly code.

02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:14.400
So in some ways there should be a slower way of doing it,

02:19:14.400 --> 02:19:16.560
but by making it a smaller amount of work

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:19.320
that I could more tightly optimize, it worked out

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:22.800
and Wolfenstein 3D was just absolutely rock solid.

02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:25.520
It was nothing glitched in there,

02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:28.320
the game just was pretty much flawless through all of that

02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:29.880
and I was super proud of that.

02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:33.280
But eventually, like in the later games,

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:35.680
I went back to the more span-based things

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:37.640
where I could get more total efficiency

02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:40.120
once I really did figure out how to do it.

02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:42.680
So there were two sort of key technical things

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:45.880
to Wolfenstein, one was this ray casting approach,

02:19:45.880 --> 02:19:48.800
which you still, to this day, you see people go and say,

02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:50.520
let's write a ray casting engine

02:19:50.520 --> 02:19:53.200
because it's an understandable way of doing things

02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:55.720
that lets you make games very much like that.

02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:57.680
So you see ray casters in JavaScript,

02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:00.680
ray casters in Python, people that are basically going

02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:05.000
and re-implementing that approach to taking a tiled world

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.560
and casting out into it.

02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:07.400
It works pretty well,

02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:09.360
but it's not the fastest way of doing it.

02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:11.440
Can you describe what ray casting is?

02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:13.480
So you start off and you've got your screen,

02:20:13.480 --> 02:20:15.840
which is 320 pixels across at the time

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:19.840
if you haven't sized down the window for greater speed.

02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:22.520
And at every pixel, there's gonna be an angle

02:20:22.520 --> 02:20:24.560
from you've got your position in the world

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:26.960
and you're going to just run along that angle

02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:29.200
and keep going until you hit a block.

02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:32.080
So up to 320 times across there,

02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:35.560
it's gonna throw a cast array out into the world

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:38.680
from wherever your origin is until it runs into a wall

02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:42.160
and then it can figure out exactly where on the wall it hits.

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:45.440
The performance challenge of that is as it's going out,

02:20:45.440 --> 02:20:49.280
every block it's crossing, it checks, is this a solid wall?

02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:52.520
So that means that in like the early Wolfenstein levels,

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:55.920
you're in a small jail cell going out into a small hallway.

02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:57.200
It's super efficient for that

02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:00.240
because you're only stepping across three or four blocks.

02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:01.800
But then if somebody makes a room

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:05.520
our maps were limited to 64 by 64 blocks.

02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:08.000
If you made one room that was nothing

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:11.040
but walls at the far space, it would go pretty slow

02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:14.440
because it would be stepping across 80 tile tests

02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:15.920
or something along the way.

02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:17.480
By the way, the physics of our universe

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:19.000
seems to be competing in this very thing.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:23.080
So this maps nicely to the actual physics of our world.

02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:25.440
Yeah, I follow a little bit of something

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:26.760
like Stephen Wolfram's work

02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:30.600
on interconnected network information states of that.

02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:35.040
And it's beyond what I can have an informed opinion on

02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.200
but it's interesting

02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:38.640
that people are considering things like that

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:41.640
and have things that can back it up.

02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:44.240
Yeah, there's whole different sets

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:45.720
of interesting stuff there.

02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:48.280
So Wolfenstein 3D had ray casting.

02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:51.120
Ray casting and then the other kind of key aspect

02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:56.000
was what I called compiled scalers where the idea of,

02:21:57.320 --> 02:21:59.800
you saw this in the earlier classic arcade games

02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:02.840
like Space Harrier and stuff where you would take a picture

02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:05.760
which is normally drawn directly on the screen.

02:22:05.760 --> 02:22:08.320
And then if you have the ability to make it bigger or smaller

02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:12.240
big chunky pixels or fizzily small drop sampled pixels.

02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:15.120
That's the fundamental aspect of what our characters

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:16.560
were doing in these 3D games.

02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:17.400
You would have,

02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:19.400
it's just like you might've drawn a tiny little character

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:20.800
but now we can make them really big

02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:23.280
and make them really small, move it around.

02:22:23.280 --> 02:22:26.520
That was the limited kind of 3D that we had for characters.

02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:27.360
To make them turn

02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.600
there were literally eight different views of them.

02:22:30.440 --> 02:22:32.480
You didn't actually have a 3D model that would rotate.

02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:34.360
You just had these cardboard cutouts

02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:37.400
but that was good enough for that startle fight reaction

02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:40.680
and it was kind of what we had to deal with there.

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.880
So a straightforward approach to do that.

02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:46.280
You could just write out your doubly nested loop of,

02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:47.680
you've got your stretch factor

02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:48.760
and it's like you've got a point,

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:50.000
you stretch by a little bit.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.280
It might be on the same pixel.

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:52.120
It might be on the next pixel.

02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:53.680
It might've skipped a pixel.

02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:55.480
You can write that out

02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:57.720
but it's not gonna be fast enough where especially

02:22:57.880 --> 02:22:59.640
for that right in your face,

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:02.200
monster covering almost the entire screen.

02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:05.080
Doing that with a general purpose scaling routine

02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:06.520
would have just been much too slow.

02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:08.320
It would have worked when they're small characters

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:09.840
but then it would get slower and slower

02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:12.160
as they got closer to you until right at the time

02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:15.320
when you most care about having a fast reaction time,

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:17.320
the game would be chunking down.

02:23:17.320 --> 02:23:22.320
So the fastest possible way to draw pixels at that time

02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:26.200
was to, instead of saying,

02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:29.440
I've got a general purpose version

02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:32.800
that can handle any scale I made,

02:23:32.800 --> 02:23:36.400
I used a program to make essentially 100 or more

02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:39.200
separate little programs that was optimized for,

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:42.240
I will take an image and I will draw it 12 pixels tall.

02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:44.720
I'll take an image, I'll draw it 14 pixels tall

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:47.720
up by every two pixels even for that.

02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:50.320
So you would have the most optimized code

02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:52.080
so that in the normal case

02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:55.360
where most of the world is fairly large,

02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:58.680
like the pixels are big, we did not have a lot of memory.

02:23:58.680 --> 02:24:01.640
So in most cases, that meant that you would load

02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:05.280
a pixel color and then you would store it multiple times.

02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:09.080
So that was faster than even copying an image

02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.760
in a normal conventional case

02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:13.280
because most of the time the image is expanded.

02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:16.640
So instead of doing one read, one write for a simple copy,

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:19.160
you might be doing one read and three or four writes

02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:20.480
as it got really big.

02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:22.360
And that had the beneficial aspect

02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:24.400
of just when you needed the performance most

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:26.000
when things are covering the screen,

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.640
it was giving you the most acceleration for that.

02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:32.520
By the way, were you able to understand this

02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:34.760
through thinking about it or were you testing

02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:36.680
like the right speed and like that?

02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:40.200
This again comes back to, I can find the antecedents

02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:41.160
for things like this.

02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:45.400
So back in the Apple II days,

02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:49.560
the graphics were essentially single bits at a time.

02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:51.800
And if you wanted to make your little spaceship,

02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:54.920
if you wanted to make it smoothly go across the world,

02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:56.760
if you just took the image and you drew it out

02:24:56.760 --> 02:24:58.000
at the next location,

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.920
you would move by seven pixels at a time.

02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:01.360
So it would go chunk, chunk, chunk.

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:03.280
If you wanted to make it move smoothly,

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:05.920
you actually had to make seven versions of the ship

02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:07.360
that were pre-shifted.

02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:09.920
You could write a program that would shift it dynamically,

02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:11.480
but on a one megahertz processor,

02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:13.200
that's not going anywhere fast.

02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:16.680
So if you wanted to do a smooth moving fast action game,

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:20.440
you made separate versions of each of these sprites.

02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:22.360
Now there were a few more tricks you could pull

02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:24.480
that if it still wasn't fast enough,

02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:26.920
you could make a compiled shape

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:31.200
where instead of this program that normally copies an image

02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:33.760
and it says like, get this byte from here, store it here,

02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:35.400
get this byte, store this byte.

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:38.440
If you've got the memory space, you could say,

02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:39.800
I'm going to write the program

02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:41.960
that does nothing but draw this shape.

02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:43.120
It's going to be like,

02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:46.640
I'm going to load the immediate value 25,

02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:47.960
which is some bit pattern.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.320
And then I'm going to store that at this location,

02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:53.280
rather than loading something from memory

02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:56.880
that involved indexing registers and this other slow stuff,

02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:57.920
you could go ahead and say, no,

02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:00.760
I'm going to hard code the exact values of all of the image

02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:02.480
right into the program.

02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:04.120
Now this was always a horrible trade off there,

02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:05.360
but you didn't have much memory

02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:07.000
and you didn't have much speed.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.600
But if you had something that you wanted to go really fast,

02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:11.800
you could turn it into a program.

02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:14.560
And that was, knowing about that technique

02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:17.640
is what made me think about some of these unwinding it

02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:19.760
for the PC, where people that didn't come

02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.400
from that background were less likely to think about that.

02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:25.640
I mean, there's some deep parallels probably

02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:27.520
to human cognition as well.

02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:32.520
There's something about optimizing and compressing

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.800
the processing of a new information

02:26:36.800 --> 02:26:39.800
that requires you to predict the possible ways

02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:44.440
in which the game or the world might unroll.

02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:47.480
And you have something like compiled scalers always there.

02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:52.760
You have a prediction of how the world will unroll

02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:57.120
and you have some kind of optimized data structure

02:26:57.120 --> 02:26:58.240
for that prediction.

02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:00.480
And then you can modify if the world turns out

02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:02.360
to be different, you can modify it in a slight way.

02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:04.240
And as far as building out techniques,

02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:07.120
so much of the brain is about the associative context.

02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:09.160
When you learn something,

02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:10.960
it's in the context of something else

02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:14.000
and you can have faint tiny little hints of things.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.480
And I do think there are some deep things

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:18.840
around like sparse distributed memories and boosting

02:27:18.840 --> 02:27:20.440
that it's like if you can just be slightly

02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:23.360
above the noise floor of having some hint of something,

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:24.840
you can have things refined

02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:26.480
into pulling the memory back up.

02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:29.560
So being a programmer and having a toolbox

02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:32.040
of like all of these things that things that I did

02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:34.760
in all of these previous lives of programming tasks,

02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:37.160
that still matters to me about how I'm able

02:27:37.160 --> 02:27:38.520
to pull up some of these things.

02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:41.160
Like in that case, it was something I did on the Apple II

02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:43.240
then being relevant for the PC.

02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:46.560
And I have still cases when I would work

02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:47.960
on mobile development then be like,

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:51.720
okay, I did something like this back in the doom days,

02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:53.560
but now it's a different environment,

02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:55.800
but I still had that tie, I can bring it in

02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:59.080
and I can transform it into what the world needs right now.

02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.920
And I do think that's actually one of the very core things

02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:06.040
with human cognition and brain-like functioning

02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:08.440
is finding these ways about you've got,

02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:11.200
your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once.

02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:13.040
It is just a set of all of this stuff

02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:16.400
that is just fetched back by these queries that go into it.

02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:18.880
And they can just be slightly above the noise floor

02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:21.240
with random noise in your neurons and synapses

02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:23.960
that are affecting exactly what gets pulled up.

02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:26.480
So you're saying some of these very specific solutions

02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:30.520
for different games, you find that there's a kernel

02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:34.720
of a deep idea that's generalizable to other things.

02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:36.440
Yeah, you can't predict what it's going to be,

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.000
but that idea of like, I called out that compiled shaders

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.760
in the forward that I wrote for that,

02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:44.920
the game engine black book, as this is,

02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:48.000
it's kind of an endpoint of unrolling code,

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.400
but that's one of those things that thinking about that

02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:51.640
and having that in your mind.

02:28:51.640 --> 02:28:53.120
And I'm sure there are some programmers

02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:55.560
that hear about that, think about it a little bit.

02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:57.040
It's kind of the mind blown moment.

02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:00.760
It's like, oh, you can just turn all of that data into code.

02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:03.360
And nowadays, you have instruction cache issues

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:05.560
and that's not necessarily the best idea,

02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:09.040
but there are different, it's an idea that has power

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:11.520
and has probably relevance in some other areas.

02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:13.040
Maybe it's in a hardware point of view

02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:15.480
that there's a way you approach building hardware

02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:17.720
that has that same, you don't even have to think

02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:19.720
about iterating, you just bake everything

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:22.240
all the way into it in one place.

02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:25.440
What is the story of how you came to program Doom?

02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:27.800
What are some memorable technical challenges

02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:29.840
or innovations within that game?

02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:33.680
So the path that we went after Wolfenstein got out

02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:37.360
and we were on this crazy arc where Keen 1 through 3,

02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:39.880
more success than we thought, Keen 4 through 6,

02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:42.880
even more success, Wolfenstein, even more success.

02:29:42.880 --> 02:29:46.440
So we were on this crazy trajectory for things.

02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:48.280
So actually our first box commercial project

02:29:48.280 --> 02:29:50.680
was a Commander Keen game,

02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:52.960
but then Wolfenstein was going to have a game called

02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:55.960
Spear of Destiny, which was a commercial version,

02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:57.280
60 new levels.

02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.480
So the rest of the team took the game engine

02:29:59.480 --> 02:30:02.760
pretty much as it was and started working on that.

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:03.920
We got new monsters,

02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:07.680
but it's basically reskins of the things there.

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:09.440
And there's a really interesting aspect about that

02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:12.280
that I didn't appreciate until much, much later

02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:16.640
about how Wolfenstein clearly did tap out its limit

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.840
about what you want to play,

02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:21.640
all the levels and a couple of our licensed things.

02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:24.040
There was a hard creative wall

02:30:24.040 --> 02:30:25.840
that you did not really benefit much

02:30:25.840 --> 02:30:27.920
by continuing to beat on it.

02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:31.480
But a game like Doom and other more modern games

02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.040
like Minecraft or something,

02:30:33.040 --> 02:30:35.080
there's kind of a Turing completeness level

02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:37.240
of design freedom that you get in games

02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:40.440
that Wolfenstein clearly sat on one side of.

02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:42.080
All the creative people in the world

02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:44.040
could not go and do a masterpiece

02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:46.520
just with the technology that Wolfenstein had.

02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:48.240
Wolfenstein could do Wolfenstein,

02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:50.840
but you really couldn't do something crazy and different.

02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:53.440
But it didn't take that much more capability

02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:56.320
to get to Wolfenstein with the free form lines

02:30:56.320 --> 02:30:58.680
and a little bit more artistic freedom

02:30:58.680 --> 02:31:01.040
to get to the point where people still announce

02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:03.800
new Doom levels today, all these years after

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:06.800
without having completely tapped out the creativity.

02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:08.600
How did you put it, Turing complete?

02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:10.280
Like Turing complete design space.

02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:11.120
Design space?

02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:12.640
Where it's like we have the kind of

02:31:12.640 --> 02:31:15.720
computational universality on a lot of things

02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:17.560
and how different substrates work.

02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:21.000
But yeah, there's things where a box can be too small,

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:22.880
but above a certain point,

02:31:22.880 --> 02:31:24.160
you're kind of are at the point

02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:27.200
where you really have almost unbounded

02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:28.440
creative ability there.

02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:31.480
And Doom was the first time you crossed that line.

02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:35.120
Yeah, where there were thousands of Doom levels created

02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:36.760
and some of them still have something new

02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:38.640
and interesting to say to the world about it.

02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:43.280
Is that line, can you introspect what that line was?

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:44.880
Is it in the design space?

02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:48.400
Is it something about the programming capabilities

02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:50.960
that you were able to add to the game?

02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:54.400
So the graphics fidelity was a necessary part

02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:57.560
because the block limitations in Wolfenstein,

02:31:57.560 --> 02:32:00.840
what we had right there was not enough,

02:32:00.840 --> 02:32:01.880
the full scale blocks.

02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:04.720
Although Minecraft, I really did show

02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:07.800
that perhaps blocks stacked in 3D

02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:09.960
and at one quarter the scale of that,

02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:11.400
or one eighth in volume,

02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:13.280
is then sufficient to have all of that.

02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:16.800
But the wall-sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein

02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:18.760
was too much of a creative limitation.

02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:21.680
We licensed the technology to a few other teams.

02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:24.920
None of them made too much of a dent with that.

02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:27.280
It just wasn't enough creative ability.

02:32:27.280 --> 02:32:28.520
But a little bit more,

02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:31.040
whether it was the variable floors and ceilings

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:33.240
and arbitrary angles in Doom,

02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:37.240
or the smaller voxel blocks in Minecraft,

02:32:37.240 --> 02:32:40.000
is then enough to open it up to just worlds

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.920
and worlds of new capabilities.

02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:45.080
What is binary space partitioning?

02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:47.640
Which is one of the technologies.

02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:51.160
Yeah, so jump around a little bit on the story path there.

02:32:51.160 --> 02:32:52.280
So while the team was working

02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:54.280
on Spirit of Destiny for Wolfenstein,

02:32:55.800 --> 02:32:58.320
we had met another development team, Raven Software,

02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:00.000
while we were in Wisconsin,

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.280
and they were doing, they had RPG background,

02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:04.760
and I still kind of loved that,

02:33:04.760 --> 02:33:07.720
and I offered to do a game engine for them,

02:33:07.720 --> 02:33:12.000
to let them do a 3D rendered RPG instead of the,

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.080
like most RPG games were kind of hand-drawn.

02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:15.520
They made it look kind of 3D,

02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:17.560
but it was done just all with artist work

02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:19.800
rather than a real engine.

02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:23.320
And after Wolfenstein, this was still a tile-based world,

02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:25.600
but I added floors and ceilings and some lighting

02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:27.680
and the ability to have some sloped floors

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:28.520
in different areas.

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:30.000
And that was my intermediate step

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.320
for a game called Shadowcaster.

02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:34.400
And it had slowed down enough.

02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:37.640
It was not fast enough to do our type of action things,

02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:39.920
so they had the screen crop down a little bit,

02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:42.240
so you couldn't go the full screen width

02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:44.520
like we would try to do in Wolfenstein.

02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:46.280
But I learned a lot.

02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:47.920
I got the floors and ceilings and lightings,

02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:48.840
and it looked great.

02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:50.320
They were great artists up there,

02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:52.280
and it was an inspiration for us

02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:54.360
to look at some of that stuff.

02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:56.960
But I had learned enough from that

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:58.480
that I had the plan for,

02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:01.560
I knew faster ways to do the lighting and shadowing,

02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:03.600
and I wanted to do this free-form geometry.

02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:06.560
I wanted to break out of this tile-based

02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:09.120
90-degree world limitations.

02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:12.280
So that was when we got our next stations,

02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:14.960
and we were working with these higher-powered systems,

02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:17.600
and we built an editor

02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:20.240
that let us draw kind of arbitrary line segments,

02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:22.720
and I was working hard to try to make something

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:24.800
that could render this fast enough.

02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:28.720
I was pushing myself pretty hard,

02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:32.160
and we were at a point where we could see some things

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.680
that looked amazingly cool,

02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:37.680
but it wasn't really fast enough for the way I was doing it.

02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:39.400
For this flexibility, it was no longer.

02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:41.040
I couldn't just raycast into it,

02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:43.200
and I had these very complex sets of lines,

02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.320
and simple little worlds were okay,

02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:47.480
but the cool things that we wanted to do

02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:49.640
just weren't quite fast enough.

02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:52.440
And I wound up taking a break at that point,

02:34:52.480 --> 02:34:54.520
and I did the port.

02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:58.000
I did two ports of our games,

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:01.040
Wolfenstein to the Super Nintendo.

02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:04.240
It was a crazy difficult thing to do,

02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:05.920
which was an even slower processor.

02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:10.000
It was like a couple of megahertz processor,

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.800
and it had been this whole thing

02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:15.440
where we had farmed out the work,

02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:18.880
and it wasn't going well, and I took it back over,

02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:21.840
and trying to make it go fast on there,

02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:25.120
where it really did not have much processing power.

02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:26.840
The pixels were stretched up hugely,

02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:29.000
and it was pretty ugly when you looked at it,

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.440
but in the end, it did come out fast enough to play

02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:33.440
and still be kind of fun from that.

02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:36.560
But that was where I started using BSP trees,

02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:38.280
or binary space partitioning trees.

02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:41.480
It was one of those things, I had to make it faster there.

02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:44.480
It was a stepping stone where it was reasonably easy

02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:46.920
to understand in the grid world of Wolfenstein,

02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:49.920
where it was all still 90 degree angles.

02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:53.880
BSP trees were, I eased myself into it with that,

02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:56.160
and it was a big success.

02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:58.720
Then when I came back to working on Doom,

02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:00.600
I had this new tool in my toolbox.

02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:02.000
It was gonna be a lot harder

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:03.880
with the arbitrary angles of Doom.

02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:06.080
This was where I really started grappling

02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:09.560
with epsilon problems, and just up until that point,

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:11.320
I hadn't really had to deal with the fact

02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:13.800
that I am so many numeric things.

02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:15.280
This almost felt like a betrayal to me,

02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:17.560
where people had told me that I had mathematicians

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:18.880
up on a bit of a pedestal,

02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:23.280
where people think I'm a math wizard, and I'm not.

02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:25.960
Everything that I did was really done

02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:29.520
with a solid high school math understanding.

02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:33.480
Algebra 2 trigonometry, and that was what got me

02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:35.480
all the way through Doom and Quake and all of that,

02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:38.280
of just understanding basics of matrices,

02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:41.040
and knowing it well enough to do something with it.

02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:43.720
What's the epsilon problems you ran into?

02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:46.720
When you wind up taking a sloped line,

02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:48.320
and you say I'm going to intersect it

02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:52.200
with another sloped line, then you wind up with something

02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:54.960
that's not going to be on these nice grid boundaries.

02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:57.120
With the Wolfenstein tile maps,

02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:58.960
all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines

02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:01.360
looking at it from above, and if you cut one of them,

02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:03.120
it's just obvious the other one gets cut

02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:04.880
exactly at that point.

02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:06.600
But when you have angled lines,

02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:08.840
you're doing a slope intercept problem,

02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:11.200
and you wind up with rational numbers there,

02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:14.800
where things that are not going to evenly land on an integer

02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:17.280
or even on any fixed point value that you've got.

02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:19.560
So everything winds up having to snap

02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:21.000
to some fixed point value,

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.440
so the lines slightly change their angle.

02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:25.360
You wind up, if you cut something here,

02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:26.880
this one's going to bend a little this way,

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:28.920
and it's not going to be completely straight,

02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:30.760
and then you come down to all these questions of,

02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:35.160
well, this one is, is a point on an angled line?

02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:38.040
You can't answer that in finite precision

02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:41.040
unless you're doing something with actual rational numbers,

02:37:41.040 --> 02:37:43.240
and later on I did waste far too much time

02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:44.240
chasing things like that.

02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:46.880
How do you do precise arithmetic with rational numbers,

02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:49.160
and it always blows up eventually,

02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:50.560
exponentially as you do it.

02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:54.080
So these kind of things are impossible with computers.

02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:57.480
They're possible, again, there are paths to doing it,

02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:00.240
but you can't fit them conveniently in any of the numbers.

02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:01.800
You need to start using big nums

02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:04.640
and different factor trackings and different things.

02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:08.120
So you have to, if you have any elements of OCD

02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:09.880
and you want to do something perfectly,

02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:12.280
you're screwed if you're working with floating point.

02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:13.120
Yeah.

02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:15.320
So you had to deal with this for the first time.

02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:18.400
And there were lots of challenges there about like,

02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:20.080
okay, they build this cool thing,

02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:22.880
and the way the BSP trees work is it basically

02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:26.400
takes the walls and it carves other walls by those walls

02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:28.760
in this clever way that you can then

02:38:28.760 --> 02:38:30.280
take all of these fragments,

02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:33.120
and then you can for sure, from any given point,

02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:35.160
get an ordering of everything in the world,

02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:36.760
and you can say, this goes in front of this,

02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:40.200
goes in front of this, all the way back to the last thing.

02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:42.400
And that's super valuable for graphics,

02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:45.280
where kind of a classic graphics algorithm

02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:46.800
would be painter's algorithm.

02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:48.200
You paint the furthest thing first,

02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:49.880
and then the next thing, and then the next thing,

02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:52.760
and then it comes up and it's all perfect for you.

02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:54.240
That's slow because you don't want to have

02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:56.160
to have drawn everything like that,

02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:57.600
but you can also flip it around

02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:59.680
and draw the closest thing to you.

02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:01.400
And then if you're clever about it,

02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:03.520
you can figure out what you need to draw

02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:05.480
that's visible beyond that.

02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:07.560
And that's what BSP trees allow you to do.

02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:10.640
Yeah, so it's combined with a bunch of other things,

02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:12.200
but it gives you that ordering.

02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:13.760
It's a clever way of doing things.

02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:15.520
And I remember I had learned this

02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:18.760
from one of my graphics Bible at the time,

02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:20.480
a book called Folly and Van Damme.

02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:22.200
And again, it was a different world back there.

02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:24.640
There was a small integer number of books.

02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:27.000
And this book, yeah.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.680
This book, it was a big fat college textbook

02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:32.520
that I had read through many times.

02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:34.240
I didn't understand everything in it.

02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:35.840
Some of it wasn't useful to me,

02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:39.640
but they had the little thing about finite orderings

02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:41.520
of you draw a little T-shaped thing,

02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:45.240
and you can make a fixed ahead of time order from this,

02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:48.200
and you can generalize this with the BSP trees.

02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:50.760
And I got a little bit more information about that.

02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:53.080
And it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake,

02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:54.760
I got to meet Bruce Naylor,

02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:56.520
who was one of the original researchers

02:39:56.520 --> 02:40:00.840
that developed those technologies for academic literature.

02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:01.720
And that was kind of fun.

02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:03.800
But I was very much just finding a tool

02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:05.840
that can help me solve what I was doing.

02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.800
And I was using it in this very crude way

02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:10.480
in a two-dimensional fashion rather than the general 3D.

02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:12.080
The Epsilon problems got much worse

02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.760
in Quake and three-dimensionals

02:40:13.760 --> 02:40:15.680
when things angle in every way.

02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:20.000
But eventually I did sort out how to do it reliably on Doom.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.240
There were still a few edge cases in Doom

02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:24.360
that were not absolutely perfect,

02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:27.760
where they even got terminologies in the communities.

02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:29.440
Like when you got to something where it was messed up,

02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:30.920
it was a Hall of Mirrors effect,

02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:33.720
because you sweep by and it wouldn't draw something there,

02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:36.200
and you would just wind up with the leftover remnants

02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:39.280
as you flipped between the two pages.

02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:41.480
But BSP trees were important for it,

02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:45.640
but it's again worth noting that after we did Doom,

02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:49.000
our major competition came from Ken Silverman

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.800
and his Build Engine, which was used for Duke Nukem 3D

02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:54.120
and some of the other games for 3D realms.

02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:56.240
And he used a completely different technology,

02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:59.240
nothing to do with BSP trees.

02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:03.880
So there's not just a one true way of doing things.

02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:05.600
There were critical things about

02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:07.160
to make any of those games fast,

02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:09.600
you had to separate your drawing into,

02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:12.440
you drew vertical lines and you drew horizontal lines,

02:41:12.440 --> 02:41:15.760
just kind of changing exactly what you would draw with them.

02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:19.360
That was critical for the technologies at that time.

02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:21.680
And like all the games that were kind of like that

02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:23.360
wound up doing something similar.

02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:25.360
But there were still a bunch of other decisions

02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:26.760
that could be made.

02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:30.320
And we made good enough decisions on everything on Doom.

02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:33.640
We brought in multiplayer significantly,

02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:36.520
and it was our first game that was designed to be modified

02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:39.280
by the user community where we had this whole setup

02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:43.080
of our WOD files and PWODs and things that people could build

02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:44.640
with tools that we released to them.

02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:46.160
And they eventually rewrote to be better

02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:48.800
than what we released, but they could build things

02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:50.360
and you could add it to your game

02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:52.200
without destructively modifying it,

02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:54.040
which is what you had to do in all the early games.

02:41:54.040 --> 02:41:56.640
You literally hacked the data files

02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:58.040
or the executable before,

02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:00.520
while Doom was set up in this flexible way

02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:03.200
so that you could just say, run the normal game

02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:04.760
with this added on on top.

02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:06.920
And it would overlay just the things

02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:08.320
that you wanted to there.

02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:11.600
Would you say that Doom was kind of the first

02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:14.240
true 3D game that you created?

02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:15.200
So no, it's still,

02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:17.800
Doom would usually be called a two and a half D game

02:42:17.800 --> 02:42:20.280
where it had three-dimensional points on it.

02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:22.400
And this is another one of these kind of pedantic things

02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:23.920
that people love to argue about,

02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:25.680
about what was the first 3D game.

02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:28.280
I still, like every month probably,

02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:29.680
I hear from somebody about,

02:42:29.680 --> 02:42:33.040
well, was Doom really a 3D game or something?

02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:37.240
And I give the point where characters

02:42:37.240 --> 02:42:38.480
had three coordinates.

02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:40.200
So you had like an X, Y, and Z,

02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:42.240
the cacodemian could be coming in very high

02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:44.960
and come down towards you.

02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:47.360
The walls had three coordinates on them.

02:42:47.360 --> 02:42:50.280
So on some sense, it's a 3D game engine,

02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:53.400
but it was not a fully general 3D game engine.

02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:56.600
You could not build a pyramid in Doom

02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:59.400
because you couldn't make a sloped wall,

02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:00.440
which was slightly different

02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:02.240
where in that previous Shadowcaster game,

02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:05.160
I couldn't have vertexes and have a sloped floor there,

02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:08.280
but the changes that I made for Doom to get higher speed

02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:10.120
and a different set of flexibility

02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:11.640
traded away that ability,

02:43:11.640 --> 02:43:13.360
but you literally couldn't make that.

02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:17.880
You could not, you could make different heights of passages,

02:43:17.880 --> 02:43:20.280
but you could not make a bridge over another area.

02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:21.880
You could not go over and above it.

02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:24.880
So it still had some 2D limitations to it.

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:26.000
That's more about the building

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:27.480
versus the actual experience,

02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:29.120
because the experience is-

02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:30.520
It felt like things would come at you,

02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:32.400
but again, you couldn't look up either.

02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:34.760
You could only pitch.

02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:36.480
It was four degrees of freedom

02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:38.440
rather than six degrees of freedom.

02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:40.640
You did not have the ability to tilt your head this way

02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:42.360
or pitch up and down.

02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:44.520
So that takes us to Quake.

02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:47.520
What was the leap there?

02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:50.080
What was some fascinating technical challenges?

02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:52.200
And there were a lot, or not challenges,

02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:54.160
but innovations that you've come up with.

02:43:54.160 --> 02:43:56.480
So Quake was kind of the first thing

02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:59.560
where I did have to kind of come face to face

02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:01.280
with my limitations,

02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:02.320
where it was the first thing

02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:05.720
where I really did kind of give it my all

02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:08.440
and still come up a little bit short

02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:11.960
in terms of what and when I wanted to get it done.

02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:15.040
And the company had some serious stresses

02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:16.800
through the whole project,

02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:19.680
and we bit off a lot.

02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:21.480
So the things that we set out to do

02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:24.680
was it was going to be really a true 3D engine

02:44:24.680 --> 02:44:27.000
where it could do six degrees of freedom.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.720
You could have all the viewpoints.

02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:31.480
You could model anything.

02:44:31.480 --> 02:44:35.280
It had a really remarkable new lighting model

02:44:35.280 --> 02:44:37.080
with the surface caching and things.

02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:38.520
That was one of those where it was starting

02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:40.760
to do some things that they weren't doing

02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:43.640
even on the very high-end systems.

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:46.960
And it was going to be completely programmable

02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:48.240
in the modding standpoint,

02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:49.840
where the thing that you couldn't do in Doom,

02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:52.400
you could replace almost all of the media,

02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:55.160
but you couldn't really change the game.

02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:56.720
There were still some people

02:44:56.720 --> 02:44:58.800
that were doing the hex setting of the executable,

02:44:58.800 --> 02:44:59.720
the de-hacked things,

02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:01.920
where you could change a few things about rules,

02:45:01.920 --> 02:45:04.640
and people made some early capture the flag type things

02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:06.040
by hacking the executable,

02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:08.560
but it wasn't really set out to do that.

02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:11.400
Quake was going to have its own programming language

02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:13.240
that the game was going to be implemented in,

02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:14.880
and that would be able to be overwritten

02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:16.600
just like any of the media.

02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:18.440
Code was going to be data for that,

02:45:18.440 --> 02:45:21.040
and you would be able to have expansion packs

02:45:21.040 --> 02:45:24.200
that changed fundamental things and mods and so on.

02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:27.160
And the multiplayer was going to be playable

02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:28.160
over the internet.

02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:30.920
It was going to support a client server

02:45:30.920 --> 02:45:32.440
rather than peer-to-peer.

02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:34.920
So we had the possibility of supporting larger numbers

02:45:34.920 --> 02:45:37.480
of players in disparate locations

02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:41.360
with this full flexibility of the programming overrides

02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:44.960
with full six degree of freedom modeling and viewing.

02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:48.000
And with this fancy new light-mapped

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.680
kind of surface caching side, it was a lot.

02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:53.760
And this was one of those things that if I could go back

02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:57.520
and tell younger me to do something differently,

02:45:57.520 --> 02:45:59.680
it would have been to split those innovations up

02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:02.040
into two phases in two separate games.

02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:03.600
What would be phase one and phase two?

02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:05.480
So it probably would have been taking

02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:07.080
the Doom rendering engine

02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:10.720
and bringing in the TCPIP client server.

02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:12.200
Focusing on the multiplayer.

02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:15.240
And the Quake C, or would have been Doom C

02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:16.920
programming language there.

02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:19.360
So I would have split that into programming language

02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:21.800
and networking with the same Doom engine

02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:25.880
rather than forcing everybody to go towards the Quake engine,

02:46:25.880 --> 02:46:27.640
which really meant getting a Pentium.

02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:31.000
While it ran on a 486, it was not a great experience there.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
We could have made more people happier

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:37.320
and gotten two games done in 50% more time.

02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:39.440
So speaking of people happier,

02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:42.840
our mutual friend Joe Rogan,

02:46:42.840 --> 02:46:46.920
it seems like the most important moment of his life

02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:49.520
is centered around Quake.

02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:53.560
So it was a definitive part of his life.

02:46:53.560 --> 02:46:58.280
So would he agree with your thinking that they should split?

02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:03.360
So he is a person who loves Quake and played Quake a lot.

02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:06.800
Would he agree that you should have done the Doom engine

02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:09.720
and focused on the multiplayer for phase one?

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:12.160
Or in your looking back,

02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:16.240
is the 3D world that Quake created

02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:19.840
was also fundamental to the enriching experience?

02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:22.600
I would say that what would have happened is

02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:25.320
you would have had a Doom looking

02:47:25.320 --> 02:47:30.000
but Quake feeling game eight months earlier,

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.200
and then maybe six months after Quake actually shipped,

02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:36.440
then there would have been the full running on a Pentium,

02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:38.760
six degree of freedom, graphics engine type things there.

02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.080
So it's not that it wouldn't have been there.

02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:45.040
It would have been something amazingly cool earlier,

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.760
and then something even cooler somewhat later,

02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:50.360
where I would much rather have gone

02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:53.240
and done two one-year development efforts.

02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:54.840
I've cycled them through.

02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:57.480
I've been a little more pragmatic about that

02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:01.120
rather than killing ourselves on the whole Quake development.

02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:04.160
But I would say it's obviously things worked out well

02:48:04.160 --> 02:48:06.480
in the end, but looking back and saying,

02:48:06.480 --> 02:48:09.000
how would I optimize and do things differently?

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.840
That did seem to be a clear case

02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:15.840
where going ahead and we had enormous momentum on Doom.

02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:19.120
We did Doom 2 as the kind of commercial boxed version

02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:22.160
after our shareware success with the original,

02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:25.720
but we could have just made another Doom game

02:48:25.720 --> 02:48:27.640
adding those new features in.

02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:28.640
It would have been huge.

02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:31.440
We would have learned all the same lessons, but faster.

02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:34.120
And it would have given six degree of freedom

02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:37.000
and Pentium class systems a little bit more time

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:40.080
to get mainstream because we did cut out a lot of people

02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:42.880
with the hardware requirements for Quake.

02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:44.800
Was there any dark moments for you personally,

02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:49.800
psychologically, in having such harsh deadlines

02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:54.680
and having to solve some difficult technical challenges?

02:48:55.680 --> 02:49:00.680
So I've never really had really dark black places.

02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:02.720
I mean, I can't necessarily put myself

02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:06.960
in anyone else's shoes, but I understand a lot of people

02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:09.600
have significant challenges

02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:12.480
with kind of their mental health and wellbeing.

02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:15.040
And I've been super stressed.

02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:18.760
I've been unhappy as a teenager in various ways,

02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:23.720
but I've never really gone to a very dark place.

02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:27.680
I just seem to be largely immune

02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:29.840
to what really wrecks people.

02:49:29.840 --> 02:49:31.080
I mean, I've had plenty of time

02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:33.880
when I'm very unhappy and miserable about something,

02:49:33.880 --> 02:49:36.400
but it's never hit me like,

02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:38.760
I believe it winds up hitting some other people.

02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:41.680
I've borne up well under whatever stresses

02:49:41.680 --> 02:49:44.360
have kind of fallen on me.

02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:46.920
And I've always coped best on that

02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:49.480
when all I need to do is usually

02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:51.240
just kind of bear down on my work.

02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:55.080
I pull myself out of whatever hole I might be slipping into

02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:57.680
by actually making progress.

02:49:57.680 --> 02:49:59.440
I mean, maybe if I was in a position

02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:01.720
where I was never able to make that progress,

02:50:01.720 --> 02:50:03.280
I could have slid down further,

02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:06.200
but I've always been in a place where,

02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:07.520
okay, a little bit more work,

02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.080
maybe I'm in a tough spot here,

02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:12.240
but I always know if I just keep pushing,

02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:14.640
eventually I break through and I make progress.

02:50:14.640 --> 02:50:16.400
I feel good about what I'm doing.

02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:20.680
And that's been enough for me so far in my life.

02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:22.480
Have you seen in the distance,

02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:28.680
like ideas of depression or contemplating suicide?

02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:30.480
Have you seen those things far?

02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:33.120
So it was interesting when I was a teenager,

02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:37.280
I was probably on some level a troubled youth.

02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:40.720
I was unhappy most of my teenage years.

02:50:40.720 --> 02:50:44.520
I wanted to be on my own doing programming all the time.

02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:47.600
As soon as I was 18, 19, even though I was poor,

02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:50.680
I was doing exactly what I wanted and I was very happy,

02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:53.000
but high school was not a great time for me.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:56.920
And I had a conversation with the school counselor

02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:58.520
and they're kind of running their script.

02:50:58.520 --> 02:51:00.560
It's like, okay, it's kind of a weird kid here.

02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:02.360
Let's carefully probe around.

02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:05.680
It's like, do you ever think about ending it all?

02:51:05.680 --> 02:51:07.480
I'm like, no, of course not.

02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:08.960
Never, not at all.

02:51:08.960 --> 02:51:09.840
This is temporary.

02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:11.440
Things are going to be better.

02:51:13.080 --> 02:51:15.560
And that's always been kind of the case for me.

02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:18.280
And obviously that's not that way for everyone

02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:20.920
and other people do react differently.

02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:25.080
What was your escape from the troubled youth?

02:51:25.080 --> 02:51:30.080
Like music, video games, books.

02:51:33.720 --> 02:51:35.520
How did you escape from a world

02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:38.240
that's full of cruelty and suffering and that's absurd?

02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:41.880
Yeah, I mean, I was not a victim of cruelty and suffering.

02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:44.800
It's like I was an unhappy, somewhat petulant youth

02:51:44.800 --> 02:51:48.320
in my point where I'm not putting myself up

02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:49.760
with anybody else's suffering,

02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:52.280
but I was unhappy objectively.

02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:54.840
And the things that I did

02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:57.280
that very much characterized my childhood

02:51:57.280 --> 02:52:00.480
were I had books, comic books,

02:52:00.480 --> 02:52:03.760
Dungeons and Dragons, arcade games, video games.

02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:06.400
Like some of my fondest childhood memories

02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:08.920
are the convenience stores, the 7-Elevens and Quick Trips,

02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:11.400
because they had a spinner rack of comic books

02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:12.720
and they had a little side room

02:52:12.720 --> 02:52:15.800
with two or three video games, arcade games in it.

02:52:15.800 --> 02:52:18.800
And that was very much my happy place.

02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:20.840
If I could, I get my comic books

02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:22.600
and if I could go to a library

02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:25.760
and go through those little zero zero zero section

02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:27.360
where computer books were supposed to be

02:52:27.360 --> 02:52:29.000
and there were a few sad little books there,

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.840
but still just being able to sit down and go through that.

02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:35.720
And I read a ridiculous number of books,

02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:38.640
both fiction and nonfiction as a teenager.

02:52:38.640 --> 02:52:42.800
And my rebelling in high school

02:52:42.800 --> 02:52:44.520
was just sitting there with my nose in a book,

02:52:44.520 --> 02:52:46.840
ignoring the class through lots of it.

02:52:46.840 --> 02:52:49.440
And teachers had a range of reactions to that,

02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:52.400
some more accepting of it than others.

02:52:53.640 --> 02:52:54.640
I'm with you on that.

02:52:54.640 --> 02:52:56.600
So let us return to Quake for a bit

02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:58.080
with the technical challenges.

02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:05.440
Everything together from the networking to the graphics,

02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:07.240
what are some things you remember

02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:10.520
that were innovations you had to come up with

02:53:10.520 --> 02:53:12.440
in order to make it all happen?

02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:14.960
Yeah, so there were a bunch of things on Quake

02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:17.560
where on the one hand, the idea that

02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:19.320
I built my own programming language

02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:21.000
to implement the game in.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:22.960
Looking back, and I try to tell people,

02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:25.520
it's like every high level programmer

02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:26.920
sometime in their career goes through

02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:28.080
and they invent their own language.

02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:30.440
It just seems to be a thing that's pretty broadly done.

02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:31.280
People will be like,

02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:33.280
I'm gonna go write a computer programming language.

02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:37.200
And I don't regret having done it,

02:53:37.200 --> 02:53:40.200
but after that, I switched from Quake C,

02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:43.280
my quirky little pseudo object orienter,

02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:45.400
entity oriented language there.

02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:47.960
Quake two went back to using DLLs with C

02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:48.960
and then Quake three,

02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:51.440
I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler,

02:53:51.440 --> 02:53:53.240
which was a much smarter thing to do

02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:55.840
that I should have done originally for Quake.

02:53:55.840 --> 02:53:57.920
But building my own language was an experience.

02:53:57.920 --> 02:53:59.720
I learned a lot from that.

02:53:59.720 --> 02:54:02.320
And then there was a generation of game programmers

02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:04.320
that learned programming with Quake C,

02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:05.720
which I feel kind of bad about

02:54:05.720 --> 02:54:08.720
because we give JavaScript a lot of crap,

02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:13.080
but Quake C was nothing to write home about there.

02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:15.760
But it allowed people to do magical things.

02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:16.840
You get into programming,

02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:21.320
not because you love the BNF syntax of a language,

02:54:21.320 --> 02:54:23.360
it's because the language lets you do something

02:54:23.360 --> 02:54:24.520
that you cared about.

02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:27.040
And here's very much you could do something

02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:29.600
in a whole beautiful three dimensional world.

02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:31.720
And the idea and the fact that the code for the game

02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:33.200
was out there, you could say,

02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:36.080
I like the shotgun, but I want it to be more badass.

02:54:36.080 --> 02:54:37.240
You go in there and say,

02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:39.280
okay, now it does 200 points damage.

02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:41.520
And then you go around with a big grin on your face,

02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.960
blowing up monsters all over the game.

02:54:43.960 --> 02:54:48.240
So yeah, it is not what I would do today,

02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:49.520
going back with that language,

02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:51.240
but that was a big part of it.

02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:54.080
Learning about the networking stuff,

02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:56.800
because it's interesting where I learn these things

02:54:56.800 --> 02:54:57.640
by reading books.

02:54:57.640 --> 02:55:00.120
So I would get a book on networking, find something,

02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:02.720
I read all about and learn, okay, packets,

02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:06.400
they can be out of order or lost or duplicated.

02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:07.240
These are all the things

02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:09.280
that can theoretically happen to packets.

02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:11.400
So I wind up spending all this time thinking about

02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:13.000
how do we deal about all of that?

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.080
And it turns out, of course, in the real world,

02:55:15.080 --> 02:55:16.040
those are things that, yes,

02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:18.080
theoretically can happen with multiple routes,

02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:22.120
but they really aren't things that your 99.999%

02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:24.000
of your packets have to deal with.

02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:28.280
So there was learning experiences about lots of that,

02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:32.080
like why, when TCP is appropriate versus UDP,

02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:34.160
and how if you do things in UDP,

02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:37.880
you wind up reinventing TCP badly in almost all cases.

02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:41.600
So there's good arguments for using both

02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:42.840
for different game technology,

02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:44.400
different parts of the game process,

02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.720
transitioning from level to level and all.

02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:49.360
But the graphics were the showcase

02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:51.920
of what Quake was all about.

02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:55.520
It was this graphics technology that nobody had seen there,

02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:57.440
and it was a while before

02:55:57.440 --> 02:55:59.560
there were competitive things out there.

02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:03.600
And it went a long time internally, really not working,

02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:05.600
where we were even building levels

02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:09.640
where the game just was not at all shippable

02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:11.240
with large fractions of the world

02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:14.040
like disappearing, not being there,

02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:16.880
or being really slow in various parts of it.

02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:18.320
And it was this act of faith.

02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:20.680
It's like, I think I'm gonna be able to fix this.

02:56:20.680 --> 02:56:23.720
I think I'm gonna be able to make this work.

02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:25.680
And lots of stuff changed

02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:27.920
where the level designers would build something

02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:30.000
and then have to throw it away as something fundamental

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:33.800
in the kind of graphics or level technology change.

02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:37.200
And so there were two big things

02:56:37.200 --> 02:56:40.400
that contributed to making it possible at that timeframe.

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.320
Two new things.

02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:44.720
There was certainly hardcore optimized

02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:46.080
low-level assembly language.

02:56:46.080 --> 02:56:48.640
This was where I had hired Michael Abrash

02:56:48.640 --> 02:56:50.280
away from Microsoft.

02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:52.360
And he had been one of my early inspirations

02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:54.720
where back in the soft disk days,

02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:57.320
the library of magazines that they had,

02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:58.840
some of my most treasured ones

02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:02.400
were Michael Abrash's articles in Dr. Dobbs' journal.

02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:06.400
And it was amazing after all of our success in Doom,

02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.080
we were able to kind of hit him up and say,

02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:10.520
hey, we'd like you to come work at id Software.

02:57:10.520 --> 02:57:13.160
And he was in the senior technical role at Microsoft.

02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:15.880
And he was on track for,

02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:18.280
and this was right when Microsoft was starting to take off.

02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:21.640
And I did eventually convince him

02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:22.760
that what we were doing

02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:24.560
was gonna be really amazing with Quake.

02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:28.280
It was going to be something nobody had seen before.

02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:31.440
It had these aspects of what we were talking about.

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:33.640
We had metaverse talk back then.

02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:36.720
We had read Snow Crash and we knew about this.

02:57:36.720 --> 02:57:40.200
And Michael was big into the science fiction

02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:42.920
and we would talk about all that and kind of spin this tale.

02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:45.200
And it was some of the same conversations

02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:46.920
that we have today about the metaverse,

02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:48.960
about how you could have different areas

02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:50.360
linked together by portals

02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:52.400
and you could have user-generated content

02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:54.440
and changing out all of these things.

02:57:54.440 --> 02:57:56.960
So you really were creating the metaverse with Quake.

02:57:56.960 --> 02:57:58.760
And we talked about things like-

02:57:58.760 --> 02:57:59.600
Philosophically.

02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:02.840
We advertised as a virtual reality experience.

02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:05.280
That was the first wave of virtual reality

02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:07.680
was in the late 80s and early 90s,

02:58:07.680 --> 02:58:10.600
you had like the Lawn Mower Man movie

02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:12.160
and you had time in Newsweek

02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:14.640
talking about the early VPL headsets.

02:58:14.640 --> 02:58:16.840
And of course that cratered so hard

02:58:16.840 --> 02:58:18.680
that people didn't wanna look at virtual reality

02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:21.960
for decades afterwards where it was just,

02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:23.240
it was smoke and mirrors.

02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:24.840
It was not real in the sense

02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:27.800
that you could actually do something real and valuable

02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:28.640
with it.

02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:32.240
But still we had that kind of common set of talking points

02:58:32.240 --> 02:58:36.400
and we were talking about what these games could become

02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:38.320
and how you'd like to see people building

02:58:38.320 --> 02:58:39.600
all of these creative things.

02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:41.920
Because we were seeing an explosion of work with Doom

02:58:41.920 --> 02:58:44.320
at that time where people were doing

02:58:44.320 --> 02:58:45.760
amazingly cool things.

02:58:45.760 --> 02:58:48.160
Like we saw cooler levels that we had built

02:58:48.160 --> 02:58:49.760
coming out of the user community

02:58:49.760 --> 02:58:53.360
and then people finding ways to change the characters

02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:54.720
in different ways and it was great.

02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:56.760
And we knew what we were doing in Quake

02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:58.880
was removing those last things.

02:58:58.880 --> 02:59:02.000
There was some quirky things with a couple of the data types

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:03.960
that didn't work right for overriding

02:59:03.960 --> 02:59:07.400
and then the core thing about the programming model.

02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:10.920
And I was definitely going to hit all of those in Quake.

02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:15.560
But the graphics side of it was still,

02:59:15.560 --> 02:59:17.120
I knew what I wanted to do

02:59:17.120 --> 02:59:20.920
and it was one of these hubris things where it's like,

02:59:20.920 --> 02:59:24.160
well, so far I've been able to kind of kick everything

02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:26.640
that I set out to go do.

02:59:26.640 --> 02:59:29.480
But Quake was definitely a little bit more

02:59:29.480 --> 02:59:32.240
than could be comfortably chewed at that point.

02:59:32.240 --> 02:59:36.920
And, but Michael was one of the strongest programmers

02:59:36.920 --> 02:59:39.240
and graphics programmers that I knew.

02:59:39.240 --> 02:59:40.920
And he was one of the people that I trusted

02:59:40.920 --> 02:59:44.360
to write assembly code better than I could.

02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:46.840
And there's a few people that I can point to

02:59:46.840 --> 02:59:50.000
about things like this where I'm a world-class optimizer.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:51.840
I mean, I make things go fast,

02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:54.760
but I recognize there's a number of people

02:59:54.760 --> 02:59:56.880
that can write tighter assembly code,

02:59:56.880 --> 03:00:01.080
tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA code than I can write.

03:00:02.200 --> 03:00:05.360
My best strengths are a little bit more at the system level.

03:00:05.360 --> 03:00:07.080
I mean, I'm good at all of that,

03:00:07.080 --> 03:00:10.320
but the most leverage comes from making the decisions

03:00:10.320 --> 03:00:11.640
that are a little bit higher up

03:00:11.640 --> 03:00:15.240
where you figure out how to change your large scale problems

03:00:15.240 --> 03:00:18.080
so that these lower level problems are easier to do

03:00:18.080 --> 03:00:20.040
or it makes it possible to do them

03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:23.400
in a uniquely fast way.

03:00:23.400 --> 03:00:27.160
So most of my big wins in a lot of ways

03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:30.360
from all the way from the early games through VR

03:00:30.360 --> 03:00:33.040
and the aerospace work that I'm doing or did,

03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:35.440
and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on now

03:00:35.440 --> 03:00:37.640
is finding an angle on something

03:00:37.640 --> 03:00:40.400
that means you trade off something

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:41.600
that you maybe think you need,

03:00:41.600 --> 03:00:43.120
but it turns out you don't need it.

03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:45.880
And by making a sacrifice in one place,

03:00:45.880 --> 03:00:48.840
you can get big advantages in another place.

03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:51.680
Is it clear at which level of the system

03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:54.320
those big advantages can be gained?

03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:55.600
It's not always clear.

03:00:55.600 --> 03:00:58.600
And that's why the thing that I try to make

03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:00.200
one of my core values,

03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:02.760
and I proselytize to a lot of people

03:01:02.760 --> 03:01:05.520
is trying to know the entire stack,

03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:08.200
trying to see through everything that happens.

03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:11.880
And it's almost impossible on the web browser level of things

03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:13.480
where there's so many levels to it,

03:01:13.480 --> 03:01:15.840
but you should at least understand what they all are,

03:01:15.840 --> 03:01:17.040
even if you can't understand

03:01:17.040 --> 03:01:20.040
all the performance characteristics at each level.

03:01:20.040 --> 03:01:23.040
But it goes all the way down to literally the hardware.

03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:26.600
So what is this chip capable of?

03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:29.440
And what is this software that you're writing capable of?

03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:31.760
And then with this architecture you put on top of that,

03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:33.320
then the ecosystem around it,

03:01:33.320 --> 03:01:35.960
all the people that are working on it.

03:01:35.960 --> 03:01:38.520
So there are all these decisions,

03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:41.240
and they're never made in a globally optimal way,

03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:43.480
but sometimes you can drive a thread

03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:45.120
of global optimality through it.

03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:47.800
You can't look at everything, it's too complicated,

03:01:47.800 --> 03:01:49.720
but sometimes you can step back up

03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:51.560
and make a different decision.

03:01:51.560 --> 03:01:53.480
And we kind of went through this on the graphics side

03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:56.520
on Quake, where in some ways it was kind of bad

03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:59.240
where Michael would spend his time writing.

03:01:59.240 --> 03:02:01.640
I'd rough out the basic routines,

03:02:01.640 --> 03:02:03.920
like, okay, here's our span rasterizer,

03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:07.320
and he would spend a month writing this beautiful

03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:10.520
cycle-optimized piece of assembly language

03:02:10.520 --> 03:02:13.320
that does what I asked it to do,

03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:16.120
and he did it faster than my original code would do,

03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:17.680
or probably what I would be able to do

03:02:17.680 --> 03:02:20.440
even if I had spent that month on it.

03:02:20.440 --> 03:02:22.680
But then we'd have some cases when I'd be like,

03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:25.480
okay, well, I figured out at this higher level

03:02:25.480 --> 03:02:28.120
instead of drawing these in a painter's order here,

03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:32.560
I do a span buffer, and it cuts out 30% or 40%

03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:35.440
of all of these pixels, but it means you need to rewrite

03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:37.320
kind of this interface of all of that.

03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:39.360
And I could tell that wore on him a little bit,

03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:41.960
but in the end it was the right thing to do,

03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:45.120
where we wound up changing that rasterization approach,

03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:48.800
and we wound up with a super-optimized assembly language

03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:51.680
core loop, and then a good system around it

03:02:51.680 --> 03:02:54.400
which minimized how much that had to be called.

03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:56.680
And so in order to be able to do this kind of system

03:02:56.680 --> 03:02:59.240
level thinking, whether we're talking about

03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:05.480
game development, aerospace, nuclear energy,

03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:10.680
AI, VR, you have to be able to understand the hardware,

03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:14.680
the low-level software, the high-level software,

03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:16.880
the design decisions, the whole thing,

03:03:16.880 --> 03:03:18.200
the full stack of it.

03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:20.480
Yeah, and that's where a lot of these things

03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:22.200
become possible, when you're really,

03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:23.960
when you're bringing the future forward,

03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:25.200
I mean, there's a pace that everything

03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:27.960
just kind of glides towards, where we have a lot of progress

03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:29.320
that's happening at such a different,

03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:32.280
so many different ways you kind of slide towards progress

03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:34.880
just left to your own, programs just get faster.

03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:37.720
For a while it wasn't clear if they were gonna get fatter

03:03:37.720 --> 03:03:39.680
more than they get, quicker than they get faster,

03:03:39.680 --> 03:03:42.400
and it cancels out, but it is clear now in retrospect,

03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:45.480
programs just get faster and have gotten faster

03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:48.000
for a long time, but if you wanna do something

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:52.080
like back at that original, talking about scrolling games,

03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:54.680
say what, this needs to be five times faster.

03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:57.680
Well, we can wait six years and just,

03:03:57.680 --> 03:04:00.840
it'll naturally get that much faster at that time,

03:04:00.840 --> 03:04:03.680
or you come up with some really clever way of doing it.

03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:06.120
So there are those opportunities like that

03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:08.080
in a whole bunch of different areas.

03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:11.760
Now, most programmers don't need to be thinking about that,

03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:14.720
there's not that many, there's a lot of opportunities

03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:17.240
for this, but it's not everyone's work-a-day type stuff,

03:04:17.240 --> 03:04:20.320
so everyone doesn't have to know how all these things work.

03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:22.880
They don't have to know how their compiler works,

03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:26.160
how the processor chip manages cache eviction

03:04:26.160 --> 03:04:28.160
and all these low-level things,

03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:31.720
but sometimes there are powerful opportunities

03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:33.160
that you can look at and say,

03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:37.240
we can bring the future five years faster.

03:04:37.240 --> 03:04:39.080
We can do something that, wouldn't it be great

03:04:39.080 --> 03:04:40.320
if we could do this?

03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:42.040
Well, we can do it today

03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:44.200
if we make a certain set of decisions.

03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:47.160
And it is in some ways, smoke and mirrors,

03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:50.480
where you say it's like, Doom was a lot of smoke and mirrors,

03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:52.280
where people thought it was more capable

03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:53.560
than it actually was,

03:04:53.560 --> 03:04:56.040
but we picked the right smoke and mirrors

03:04:56.040 --> 03:04:59.000
to deploy in the game, where by doing this,

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:00.920
people will think that it's more general

03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:03.440
if we were gonna amaze them with what they've got here,

03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:05.000
and they won't notice

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.640
that it doesn't do these other things.

03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:09.920
So smart decision-making at that point,

03:05:09.920 --> 03:05:13.280
that's where that kind of global,

03:05:13.280 --> 03:05:16.400
holistic, top-down view can work.

03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:20.200
And I'm really a strong believer

03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:23.960
that technology should be sitting at that table

03:05:23.960 --> 03:05:25.040
having those discussions,

03:05:25.040 --> 03:05:26.680
because you do have cases where you say,

03:05:26.680 --> 03:05:28.600
well, you wanna be the Jonathan Ivey or whatever,

03:05:28.600 --> 03:05:32.080
where it's a pure design solution.

03:05:32.080 --> 03:05:35.200
And that's, in some cases now

03:05:35.200 --> 03:05:37.760
where you truly have almost infinite resources,

03:05:38.240 --> 03:05:41.440
if you're trying to do a scrolling game on the PC now,

03:05:41.440 --> 03:05:43.600
you don't even have to talk to a technology person.

03:05:43.600 --> 03:05:45.440
You can just have,

03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:48.440
any intern can make that go run as fast as it needs to there,

03:05:48.440 --> 03:05:50.640
and it can be completely design-based.

03:05:50.640 --> 03:05:53.160
But if you're trying to do something that's hard,

03:05:53.160 --> 03:05:55.800
either that can't be done for resources

03:05:55.800 --> 03:05:58.040
like VR on a mobile chipset,

03:05:58.040 --> 03:06:00.040
or that we don't even know how to do yet,

03:06:00.040 --> 03:06:02.000
artificial general intelligence,

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.520
it's probably going to be a matter of coming at it

03:06:04.520 --> 03:06:05.560
from an angle.

03:06:05.560 --> 03:06:07.640
I mean, for AGI, we have some of,

03:06:08.480 --> 03:06:10.960
some of the Hutter principles about how you can,

03:06:10.960 --> 03:06:13.760
some of the, there are theoretical ways that you can say,

03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:15.600
this is the optimal learning algorithm

03:06:15.600 --> 03:06:17.080
that can solve everything,

03:06:17.080 --> 03:06:18.960
but it's completely impractical.

03:06:18.960 --> 03:06:20.560
You just can't do that.

03:06:20.560 --> 03:06:23.720
So clearly you have to make some concessions

03:06:23.720 --> 03:06:25.640
for general intelligence,

03:06:25.640 --> 03:06:27.680
and nobody knows what the right ones are yet.

03:06:27.680 --> 03:06:29.680
So people are taking different angles of attack.

03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:31.440
I hope I've got something clever

03:06:31.440 --> 03:06:34.480
to come up with in that space.

03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:35.880
It's been surprising to me,

03:06:36.320 --> 03:06:38.760
perhaps it is a principle of progress,

03:06:38.760 --> 03:06:40.600
that smoke and mirrors somehow

03:06:40.600 --> 03:06:42.800
is the way you build the future.

03:06:42.800 --> 03:06:46.400
You kind of fake it till you make it,

03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:47.760
and you almost always make it,

03:06:47.760 --> 03:06:50.360
and you think that's going to be the way we achieve AGI,

03:06:50.360 --> 03:06:53.600
that's going to be the way we build consciousness

03:06:53.600 --> 03:06:55.080
into our machines.

03:06:56.120 --> 03:06:59.880
There's philosophers debate about the Turing test

03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:02.880
is essentially about faking it till you make it.

03:07:02.880 --> 03:07:04.520
You start by faking it.

03:07:04.520 --> 03:07:09.080
And I think that always leads to making it,

03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:09.920
because if you look at history-

03:07:09.920 --> 03:07:11.720
Most of the philosophers arguments when,

03:07:11.720 --> 03:07:13.920
as soon as people start talking about qualia

03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:16.240
and consciousness and Chinese rooms and things,

03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:17.600
it's like, I just check out.

03:07:17.600 --> 03:07:20.200
I just don't think there's any value in those conversations.

03:07:20.200 --> 03:07:22.520
It's just like, go ahead, tell me it's not going to work.

03:07:22.520 --> 03:07:25.360
I'm going to do my best to try to make it work anyways.

03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:26.920
I don't know if you work with legged robots

03:07:26.920 --> 03:07:28.080
or a bunch of these.

03:07:29.400 --> 03:07:33.920
They sure as heck make me feel like they're cautious.

03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:37.160
In a certain way, that's not here today,

03:07:37.160 --> 03:07:41.280
but you could see the kernel,

03:07:41.280 --> 03:07:46.040
it's like the flame, the beginnings of a flame.

03:07:46.040 --> 03:07:47.480
We don't have line of sight,

03:07:47.480 --> 03:07:50.120
but there's glimmerings of light in the distance

03:07:50.120 --> 03:07:51.040
for all of these things.

03:07:51.040 --> 03:07:53.560
Yeah, I'm hearing murmuring in a distant room.

03:07:54.920 --> 03:07:56.800
Well, let me ask you a human question here.

03:07:56.800 --> 03:07:59.880
You've in the game design space,

03:07:59.880 --> 03:08:01.920
you've done a lot of incredible work throughout,

03:08:01.920 --> 03:08:05.800
but in terms of game design, you have changed the world

03:08:05.800 --> 03:08:08.440
and there's a few people around you that did the same.

03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:13.040
So famously, there's some animosity, there's much love,

03:08:13.040 --> 03:08:16.360
but there's some animosity between you and John Romero.

03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:19.960
What is at the core of that animosity and human tension?

03:08:19.960 --> 03:08:24.080
So there really hasn't been for a long time.

03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:25.520
And even at the beginning, it's like,

03:08:25.520 --> 03:08:29.520
yes, I did push Romero out of the company.

03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:32.120
And this is one of the things that I look back,

03:08:32.120 --> 03:08:35.920
if I could go back telling my younger self

03:08:35.920 --> 03:08:37.800
some advice about things,

03:08:37.800 --> 03:08:41.880
the original founding kind of corporate structure

03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:45.680
of id Software really led to a bunch of problems.

03:08:45.680 --> 03:08:48.480
We started off with us as equal partners

03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:50.360
and we had a buy-sell agreement

03:08:50.360 --> 03:08:52.480
because we didn't want outsiders to be telling us

03:08:52.480 --> 03:08:54.360
what to do inside the company.

03:08:54.360 --> 03:08:57.240
And that did lead to a bunch of the problems

03:08:57.240 --> 03:08:59.600
where I was sitting here going,

03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:02.920
it's like, all right, I'm working harder than anyone,

03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:06.320
I'm doing these technologies nobody's done before,

03:09:06.320 --> 03:09:08.120
but we're all equal partners.

03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:11.520
And then I see somebody that's not working as hard.

03:09:11.520 --> 03:09:16.160
And I mean, I can't say I was the most mature about that.

03:09:16.160 --> 03:09:21.160
I was 20 something years old and it did bother me

03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:24.000
when I'm like, everybody, okay, we need to all pull together

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:25.520
and we've done it before, everybody,

03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:27.680
we know we can do this if we get together

03:09:27.680 --> 03:09:29.400
and we grind it all out,

03:09:29.400 --> 03:09:33.560
but not everybody wanted to do that for all time.

03:09:33.560 --> 03:09:35.720
I was the youngest one of the crowd there.

03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:40.480
I had different sets of kind of backgrounds and motivations

03:09:40.480 --> 03:09:44.920
and left at that point where it was, all right,

03:09:44.920 --> 03:09:48.480
either everybody has to be contributing up to this level

03:09:48.480 --> 03:09:50.360
or they need to get pushed out.

03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:54.120
That was not a great situation.

03:09:54.120 --> 03:09:56.800
And I look back on it and no,

03:09:56.800 --> 03:09:58.400
we pushed people out of the company

03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:00.280
that could have contributed

03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:02.800
if there was a different framework for them.

03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:04.640
And the modern kind of Silicon Valley,

03:10:04.640 --> 03:10:07.000
like let your stock vest over a time period

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:08.760
and maybe it's non-voting stock

03:10:08.760 --> 03:10:09.800
and all those different things.

03:10:09.800 --> 03:10:11.360
We knew nothing about any of that.

03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:13.840
I mean, we didn't know what we were doing

03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:16.440
in terms of corporate structure or anything.

03:10:16.440 --> 03:10:18.400
So if you think the framework was different,

03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:20.720
some of the human tension could have been a little bit.

03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:22.840
It almost certainly would have.

03:10:22.840 --> 03:10:24.200
I mean, I look back at that

03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:27.680
and it's like even trying to summon up in my mind,

03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:30.840
it's like, I know I was really, really angry

03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:35.560
about Romero not working as hard as I wanted him to work

03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:39.000
or not carrying his load on the design for Quake

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:40.880
and coming up with things there.

03:10:40.880 --> 03:10:43.040
But he was definitely doing things.

03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:44.880
He made some of the best levels there.

03:10:44.880 --> 03:10:47.720
He was working with some of our external teams

03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:50.400
like Raven on the licensing side of things.

03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:55.400
But there were differences of opinion about it,

03:10:55.400 --> 03:10:57.200
but he landed right on his feet.

03:10:57.200 --> 03:10:59.600
He went and he got $20 million from Eidos

03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:02.920
to go do Ion Storm and he got to do things his way

03:11:02.920 --> 03:11:05.640
and spun up three teams simultaneously

03:11:05.640 --> 03:11:08.120
because that was always one of the challenging things

03:11:08.120 --> 03:11:10.960
in it, Id, where we were doing these single string

03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:13.120
one project after another.

03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:16.320
And I think some of them wanted to grow the company more.

03:11:16.320 --> 03:11:19.160
And I didn't because I knew people that were saying that,

03:11:19.200 --> 03:11:22.200
oh, companies turn to shit when you got 50 employees.

03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:24.000
It's just a different world there.

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:28.400
And I loved our little dozen people working on the projects,

03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:29.880
but you can look at it and say,

03:11:29.880 --> 03:11:31.720
well, business realities matter.

03:11:31.720 --> 03:11:33.480
It's like you're super successful here

03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:36.280
and we could take a swing and a miss on something,

03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:39.280
but you do it a couple of times and you're out of luck.

03:11:39.280 --> 03:11:43.000
There's a reason companies try to have multiple teams

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:44.400
running at one time.

03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:47.280
And so I was thinking of something

03:11:47.360 --> 03:11:49.640
I didn't really appreciate back then.

03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:51.040
So if you look past all that,

03:11:51.040 --> 03:11:53.800
you did create some amazing things together.

03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:55.800
What did you love about John Romero?

03:11:55.800 --> 03:11:57.760
What did you respect and appreciate about him?

03:11:57.760 --> 03:11:59.120
What did you admire about him?

03:11:59.120 --> 03:12:01.000
What did you learn from him?

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:02.520
When I met him, he was the coolest programmer

03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:04.040
I had ever met.

03:12:04.040 --> 03:12:05.600
He had done all of this stuff.

03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:07.640
He had made all of these games.

03:12:07.640 --> 03:12:10.120
He had worked at one of the companies

03:12:10.120 --> 03:12:12.800
that I thought was the coolest at Origin Systems.

03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:14.600
And he knew all this stuff.

03:12:14.600 --> 03:12:16.280
He made things happen fast.

03:12:17.240 --> 03:12:18.920
He was also kind of a polymath about this,

03:12:18.920 --> 03:12:21.560
where he could do, he drew his own art,

03:12:21.560 --> 03:12:24.320
he made his own levels as well as,

03:12:24.320 --> 03:12:26.240
he worked on sound design systems

03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:29.280
on top of actually being a really good programmer.

03:12:29.280 --> 03:12:32.800
And we went through a little, it was kind of fun

03:12:32.800 --> 03:12:34.680
where one of the early things that we did

03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:37.040
where there was kind of the young buck bit going in

03:12:37.040 --> 03:12:42.040
where I was the new guy and he was the top man programmer

03:12:42.800 --> 03:12:44.720
at the soft disk area.

03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:47.120
And eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend

03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:49.680
that we were gonna like race to implement this game

03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:52.800
to port one of our PC games back down to the Apple II.

03:12:52.800 --> 03:12:55.240
And that was where we finally kind of became clear.

03:12:55.240 --> 03:12:57.760
It's like, okay, Carmack stands a little bit apart

03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:00.320
on the programming side of things.

03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:03.080
But Romero then very gracefully moved into,

03:13:03.080 --> 03:13:04.520
well, he'll work on the tools,

03:13:04.520 --> 03:13:06.160
he'll work on the systems,

03:13:06.160 --> 03:13:07.680
do some of the game design stuff

03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:10.480
as well as contributing on starting to lead

03:13:10.480 --> 03:13:12.920
the design aspects of a lot of things.

03:13:12.920 --> 03:13:16.960
So he was enormously valuable in the early stuff

03:13:16.960 --> 03:13:19.200
and so much of Doom and even Quake

03:13:19.200 --> 03:13:21.960
have his stamp on it in a lot of ways.

03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:25.680
But he wasn't at the same level of focus

03:13:25.680 --> 03:13:29.200
that I brought to the work that we were doing there.

03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:33.560
And he really did, we hit such a degree of success

03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:36.280
that it was all in the press about that,

03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:38.560
the rock star game programmers.

03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:40.120
I mean, it's the Beatles problem.

03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:42.160
Yeah, I mean, he ate it up

03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:43.320
and he did personify,

03:13:43.320 --> 03:13:47.440
there was the whole game developers with Ferraris

03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:49.000
that we had there.

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:53.520
And I thought that led to some challenges there.

03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:58.080
But so much of the stuff that was great in the games

03:13:58.080 --> 03:13:59.240
did come from him.

03:13:59.240 --> 03:14:01.920
And I would certainly not take that away from him.

03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:04.480
And even after we parted ways

03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:07.080
and he took his swing with Eidos,

03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:09.280
in some ways he was ahead of the curve

03:14:09.280 --> 03:14:10.880
with mobile gaming as well,

03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:13.480
where one of his companies after Eidos

03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:16.800
was working on feature phone game development.

03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:19.360
And I wound up doing some of that

03:14:19.360 --> 03:14:20.600
just before the iPhone,

03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:23.080
crossing over into the iPhone phase there.

03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:25.600
And that was something that clearly did turn out

03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:26.520
to be a huge thing,

03:14:26.520 --> 03:14:28.600
although he was too early

03:14:28.600 --> 03:14:31.680
for what he was working on at that time.

03:14:31.680 --> 03:14:34.080
We've had pretty cordial relationships

03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:35.480
where I was happy to talk with him

03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:38.200
any time I'd run into him at a conference.

03:14:38.200 --> 03:14:40.200
I haven't actually had some other people

03:14:40.200 --> 03:14:41.040
just say it's like,

03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:42.960
oh, you shouldn't go over there

03:14:42.960 --> 03:14:44.440
and give him the time of day

03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:49.440
or felt that Masters of Doom was like portrayed,

03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:50.960
played things up in a way

03:14:50.960 --> 03:14:52.520
that I shouldn't be too happy with,

03:14:52.520 --> 03:14:54.760
but I'm okay with all of that.

03:14:54.760 --> 03:14:55.600
And I know-

03:14:55.600 --> 03:14:56.800
So you still got love in your heart.

03:14:56.800 --> 03:15:00.000
Yeah, I mean, I just talked with him last year,

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:01.080
I guess it was even this year

03:15:01.080 --> 03:15:03.840
about mentioning that I'm going off doing this AI stuff.

03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:06.600
I'm going big into artificial intelligence.

03:15:06.600 --> 03:15:08.440
And he had a bunch of ideas

03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:10.960
for how AI is gonna play into gaming

03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:13.480
and asked if I was interested in collaborating.

03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:16.320
And it's not in line with what I'm doing,

03:15:16.320 --> 03:15:19.680
but I do, I wish almost everyone the best.

03:15:19.680 --> 03:15:21.680
I mean, I know I may not have partnered

03:15:21.680 --> 03:15:24.480
on the best of terms with some people,

03:15:24.480 --> 03:15:29.080
but I was thrilled to see Tom Hall writing VR games now.

03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:31.360
He wrote, I worked on a game called Denio,

03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:33.760
which is really an awesome VR game.

03:15:33.760 --> 03:15:35.000
It's like Dungeons and Dragons.

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:36.800
We all used to play Dungeons and Dragons together.

03:15:36.800 --> 03:15:37.640
That was one of the things,

03:15:37.640 --> 03:15:40.280
that was what we did on Sundays in the early days.

03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:42.200
I would Dungeon Master and they'd all play.

03:15:42.200 --> 03:15:45.720
And so it really made me smile seeing Tom involved

03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:48.640
with an RPG game in virtual reality.

03:15:49.680 --> 03:15:54.600
You were the CTO of Oculus VR since 2013

03:15:54.600 --> 03:15:59.600
and maybe less than a year involved in a bit in 2019.

03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:04.880
Oculus was acquired by Facebook Now Meta in 2014.

03:16:04.920 --> 03:16:07.840
You've spoken brilliantly about both the low level details,

03:16:07.840 --> 03:16:10.160
the experimental design and the big picture vision

03:16:10.160 --> 03:16:12.080
of virtual reality.

03:16:12.080 --> 03:16:15.720
Let me ask you about the metaverse, the big question here,

03:16:15.720 --> 03:16:18.040
both philosophically and technically.

03:16:18.040 --> 03:16:20.240
How hard is it to build the metaverse?

03:16:20.240 --> 03:16:22.740
What is the metaverse in your view?

03:16:22.740 --> 03:16:25.000
You started with discussing and thinking about Quake

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:26.400
as a kind of a metaverse.

03:16:27.280 --> 03:16:31.360
As you think about it today, what is the metaverse,

03:16:31.360 --> 03:16:34.440
the thing that could create this compelling user value,

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:36.840
this experience that will change the world

03:16:36.840 --> 03:16:39.000
and how hard is it to build it?

03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:42.040
So the term comes from Neal Stephenson's book, Snow Crash,

03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:44.680
which many of us had read back in the 90s.

03:16:44.680 --> 03:16:47.480
It was one of those kind of formative books.

03:16:47.480 --> 03:16:52.480
And there was this sense that the possibilities

03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:56.080
and kind of the freedom and unlimited capabilities

03:16:56.080 --> 03:16:59.520
to build a virtual world that does whatever you want,

03:16:59.520 --> 03:17:02.240
whatever you ask of it has been a powerful draw

03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:05.600
for generations of developers, game developers specifically

03:17:05.600 --> 03:17:07.000
and people that are thinking about

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:10.200
more general purpose applications.

03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:12.880
So we were talking about that back in the Doom

03:17:12.880 --> 03:17:15.180
and Quake days about how do you wind up

03:17:15.180 --> 03:17:17.120
with an interconnected set of worlds

03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:19.160
that you kind of visit from one to another

03:17:19.160 --> 03:17:21.480
and as web pages were becoming a thing,

03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:25.080
you start thinking about what is the interactive

03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:27.480
kind of 3D based equivalent of this.

03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:29.760
And there were a lot of really bad takes.

03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:34.240
You had like vermal, virtual reality markup languages

03:17:34.240 --> 03:17:38.200
and there's aspects like that that came from people saying,

03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:41.360
well, what kind of capabilities should we develop

03:17:41.360 --> 03:17:43.640
to enable this?

03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:45.600
And that kind of capability first work

03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:48.760
has usually not panned out very well.

03:17:48.760 --> 03:17:51.520
On the other hand, we have successful games

03:17:51.520 --> 03:17:53.640
that started with things like Doom and Quake

03:17:53.640 --> 03:17:55.640
and communities that formed around those.

03:17:55.640 --> 03:17:58.720
And whether it was server lists in the early days

03:17:58.720 --> 03:18:01.680
or literal portaling between different games

03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:03.640
and then modern things

03:18:03.640 --> 03:18:05.440
that are on completely different order of magnitude

03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:07.200
like Minecraft and Fortnite

03:18:07.200 --> 03:18:09.900
that have a hundred million plus users.

03:18:11.840 --> 03:18:13.760
I still think that that's the right way

03:18:13.760 --> 03:18:15.160
to go to build the metaverse

03:18:15.160 --> 03:18:18.240
is you build something that's amazing that people love

03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:20.960
and people wind up spending all their time in

03:18:20.960 --> 03:18:21.960
because it's awesome

03:18:21.960 --> 03:18:24.360
and you expand the capabilities of that.

03:18:24.360 --> 03:18:26.680
So even if it's a very basic experience,

03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:31.800
Minecraft is an amazing case study in so many things

03:18:31.800 --> 03:18:34.520
where what's been able to be done with that

03:18:34.520 --> 03:18:36.960
is really enlightening.

03:18:36.960 --> 03:18:39.760
And there are other cases where like right now,

03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:43.280
Roblox is basically a game construction kit aimed at kids

03:18:43.280 --> 03:18:45.080
and that was a capability first play

03:18:45.080 --> 03:18:46.440
and it's achieving scale

03:18:46.440 --> 03:18:49.040
that's on the same order of those things.

03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:53.400
So it's not impossible, but my preferred bet would be

03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:55.200
you make something amazing that people love

03:18:55.200 --> 03:18:56.760
and you make it better and better.

03:18:56.760 --> 03:18:59.600
And that's where I could say we could have gone back

03:18:59.600 --> 03:19:02.840
and followed a path kind of like that in the early days

03:19:02.840 --> 03:19:04.760
if you just kind of take the same game,

03:19:04.760 --> 03:19:07.080
whether it's when Activision demonstrated

03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:09.200
that you could make Call of Duty every year

03:19:09.200 --> 03:19:12.120
and not only is it not bad, people kind of love it

03:19:12.120 --> 03:19:14.480
and it's very profitable.

03:19:14.480 --> 03:19:17.320
The idea that you could have taken something like that,

03:19:17.320 --> 03:19:20.260
take a great game, release a new version every year

03:19:20.260 --> 03:19:23.040
that lets the capabilities grow and expand

03:19:23.080 --> 03:19:24.520
to start saying it's like, okay,

03:19:24.520 --> 03:19:26.840
it's a game about running around and shooting things,

03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:30.320
but now you can have, bring your media into it,

03:19:30.320 --> 03:19:35.080
you can add persistence of social signs of life

03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:36.780
or whatever you wanna add to it.

03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:41.920
I still think that's quite a good position to take.

03:19:41.920 --> 03:19:44.560
And I think that while Meta is doing

03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:47.960
a bottoms up capability approach with Horizon Worlds

03:19:47.960 --> 03:19:50.680
where it's a fairly general purpose,

03:19:50.680 --> 03:19:52.480
creators can build whatever they want

03:19:52.480 --> 03:19:53.720
in their sort of thing.

03:19:55.880 --> 03:19:57.640
It's hard to compare and compete

03:19:57.640 --> 03:19:58.800
with something like Fortnite,

03:19:58.800 --> 03:20:01.760
which also has enormous amounts of creativity,

03:20:01.760 --> 03:20:03.680
even though it was not designed originally

03:20:03.680 --> 03:20:05.840
as a general purpose sort of thing.

03:20:05.840 --> 03:20:08.600
So there's, we have examples on both sides.

03:20:08.600 --> 03:20:12.660
Me personally, I would have bet on trying to do

03:20:12.660 --> 03:20:15.320
entertainment, valuable destination first

03:20:15.320 --> 03:20:17.080
and expanding from there.

03:20:17.080 --> 03:20:22.080
So can you imagine the thing that will be kind of,

03:20:22.240 --> 03:20:25.400
if we look back a couple of centuries from now

03:20:25.400 --> 03:20:29.000
and you think about the experiences

03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:32.080
that marked the singularity, the transition

03:20:33.760 --> 03:20:37.680
where most of our world moved into virtual reality,

03:20:37.680 --> 03:20:40.640
what do you think those experiences will look like?

03:20:40.640 --> 03:20:42.480
So I do think it's gonna be kind of like

03:20:42.480 --> 03:20:44.880
the way the web slowly took over

03:20:44.880 --> 03:20:47.640
where you're the frog in the pot of water

03:20:47.640 --> 03:20:48.880
that's slowly heating up,

03:20:48.880 --> 03:20:51.520
where having lived through all of that,

03:20:51.520 --> 03:20:54.600
I remember when it was shocking to start seeing

03:20:54.600 --> 03:20:57.040
the first website address on a billboard

03:20:57.040 --> 03:20:58.600
when you're like, hey, my computer world

03:20:58.600 --> 03:21:00.720
is infecting the real world.

03:21:00.720 --> 03:21:03.160
This is spreading out in some way,

03:21:03.160 --> 03:21:05.440
but there's still, when you look back and say,

03:21:05.440 --> 03:21:08.400
well, what made the web take off?

03:21:08.400 --> 03:21:12.120
And it wasn't a big bang sort of moment there.

03:21:12.120 --> 03:21:14.640
It was a bunch of little things that turned out

03:21:14.640 --> 03:21:17.320
not to even be the things that are relevant now

03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:18.880
that brought them into it.

03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:21.400
Well, I wonder from, I mean, like you said,

03:21:21.400 --> 03:21:23.240
you're not a historian.

03:21:23.240 --> 03:21:26.680
So maybe there's a historian out there

03:21:26.680 --> 03:21:30.760
that could really identify that moment, data-driven way.

03:21:30.760 --> 03:21:33.680
It could be like MySpace or something like that.

03:21:33.680 --> 03:21:36.240
Maybe the first major social network

03:21:36.240 --> 03:21:41.080
that really reached into non-geek world

03:21:41.080 --> 03:21:42.240
or something like that.

03:21:42.240 --> 03:21:45.200
I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians though,

03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:48.760
looking for some of those kind of primary dominant causes

03:21:48.760 --> 03:21:51.400
where so many of these things are,

03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:53.120
like we see an exponential curve,

03:21:53.120 --> 03:21:56.000
but it's not because like one thing is going exponential.

03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:59.200
It's because we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves

03:21:59.200 --> 03:22:00.880
overlapped on top of each other,

03:22:00.880 --> 03:22:02.560
and they just happen to keep adding up

03:22:02.560 --> 03:22:05.600
so that you've got something kind of going exponential

03:22:05.600 --> 03:22:06.520
at any given point,

03:22:06.520 --> 03:22:09.360
but no single one of them was the critical thing.

03:22:09.360 --> 03:22:11.760
There were dozens and dozens of things.

03:22:11.760 --> 03:22:14.000
I mean, seeing the transitions of stuff like,

03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:16.680
as obviously MySpace giving way to other things,

03:22:16.680 --> 03:22:20.240
but even like blogging giving way to social media

03:22:20.240 --> 03:22:22.920
and getting resurrected in other guises

03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:24.840
and the things that happened there.

03:22:24.840 --> 03:22:27.040
Dancing baby GIF or whatever,

03:22:27.040 --> 03:22:29.200
all your base now belong to us.

03:22:29.200 --> 03:22:32.400
Whatever those early memes that led to the modern memes

03:22:32.400 --> 03:22:36.320
and the humor on the different evolution of humor

03:22:36.320 --> 03:22:38.480
on the internet that I'm sure the historians

03:22:38.480 --> 03:22:42.000
will also write books about from the different website

03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.600
that support, that create the infrastructure for that humor

03:22:44.600 --> 03:22:46.880
like Reddit and all that kind of stuff.

03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:49.400
So people will go back and they will name firsts

03:22:49.400 --> 03:22:50.440
and critical moments,

03:22:50.440 --> 03:22:53.240
but it's probably going to be a poor approximation

03:22:53.240 --> 03:22:55.040
of what actually happens.

03:22:55.040 --> 03:22:57.600
And we've already seen like in the VR space

03:22:57.600 --> 03:23:01.120
where it didn't play out the way we thought it would

03:23:01.120 --> 03:23:03.480
in terms of what was going to be like when,

03:23:03.480 --> 03:23:05.560
the modern era of VR basically started

03:23:05.560 --> 03:23:08.560
with my E3 demo of Doom 3 on the Rift prototype.

03:23:08.560 --> 03:23:11.040
So we're like first person shooters in VR,

03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:12.960
match made in heaven, right?

03:23:12.960 --> 03:23:15.600
And that didn't work out that way at all.

03:23:15.600 --> 03:23:18.480
They have the most comfort problems with it.

03:23:18.480 --> 03:23:22.200
And then the most popular virtual reality app is Beat Saber,

03:23:22.200 --> 03:23:24.920
which nobody predicted back then.

03:23:24.920 --> 03:23:28.800
What's that make you like from first principles

03:23:28.800 --> 03:23:31.400
if you were to like reverse engineer that,

03:23:31.400 --> 03:23:35.440
why are these like silly fun games the most?

03:23:35.440 --> 03:23:37.400
It actually makes very clear sense

03:23:37.400 --> 03:23:40.520
when you analyze it from hindsight

03:23:40.520 --> 03:23:42.000
and look at the engineering reasons

03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:45.480
where it's not just that it was a magical quirky idea.

03:23:45.480 --> 03:23:47.880
It was something that played almost perfectly

03:23:47.880 --> 03:23:50.560
to what turned out to be the real strengths of VR

03:23:50.560 --> 03:23:53.520
where the one thing that I really underestimated importance

03:23:53.520 --> 03:23:56.040
in VR was the importance of the controllers.

03:23:56.040 --> 03:23:57.760
I was still thinking we could do a lot more

03:23:57.760 --> 03:24:00.600
with the game pad and just the amazingness

03:24:00.600 --> 03:24:02.000
of taking any existing game,

03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:04.400
being able to move your head around and look around

03:24:04.400 --> 03:24:06.240
that that was really amazing.

03:24:06.240 --> 03:24:09.080
But the controllers were super important,

03:24:09.080 --> 03:24:10.880
but the problem is so many things that you do

03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:13.480
with the controllers just suck.

03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:14.800
It feels like it breaks the illusion,

03:24:14.800 --> 03:24:16.960
like trying to pick up glasses with the controllers

03:24:16.960 --> 03:24:18.640
where you're like, oh, use the grip button

03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:21.480
when you're kind of close and it'll snap into your hand.

03:24:21.480 --> 03:24:25.440
All of those things are unnatural actions that you do them

03:24:25.440 --> 03:24:27.760
and it's still part of the VR experience,

03:24:27.760 --> 03:24:32.520
but Beat Saber winds up playing only to the strengths.

03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:34.680
It completely hides all the weaknesses of it

03:24:34.680 --> 03:24:37.160
because you are holding something in your hand.

03:24:37.160 --> 03:24:39.400
You keep a solid grip on it the whole time.

03:24:39.440 --> 03:24:42.360
It slices through things without ever bumping into things.

03:24:42.360 --> 03:24:44.480
You never get into the point where,

03:24:44.480 --> 03:24:45.720
I'm knocking on this table,

03:24:45.720 --> 03:24:48.120
but in VR my hand just goes right through it.

03:24:48.120 --> 03:24:51.120
So you've got something that slices through.

03:24:51.120 --> 03:24:53.160
So it's never your brain telling you,

03:24:53.160 --> 03:24:54.560
oh, I should have hit something.

03:24:54.560 --> 03:24:55.800
You've got a lightsaber here.

03:24:55.800 --> 03:24:59.000
It's just, you expect it to slice through everything.

03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:02.480
Audio and music turned out to be a really powerful aspect

03:25:02.480 --> 03:25:05.240
of virtual reality where you're blocking the world off

03:25:05.240 --> 03:25:07.640
and constructing the world around you.

03:25:07.640 --> 03:25:10.960
And being something that can run efficiently

03:25:10.960 --> 03:25:13.760
on even this relatively low powered hardware

03:25:13.760 --> 03:25:17.720
and can have a valuable loop in a small amount of time

03:25:17.720 --> 03:25:19.560
where a lot of modern games,

03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:21.520
you're supposed to sit down and play it for an hour

03:25:21.520 --> 03:25:22.360
just to get anywhere.

03:25:22.360 --> 03:25:23.680
Sometimes a new game takes an hour

03:25:23.680 --> 03:25:25.400
to get through the tutorial level.

03:25:25.400 --> 03:25:27.880
And that's not good for VR for a couple reasons.

03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:29.760
You do still have the comfort issues

03:25:29.760 --> 03:25:31.480
if you're moving around at all,

03:25:31.480 --> 03:25:34.800
but you've also got just discomfort from the headset,

03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:37.560
battery lifespan on the mobile versions.

03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:39.200
So having things that do break down

03:25:39.200 --> 03:25:42.200
into three and four minute windows of play,

03:25:42.200 --> 03:25:43.840
that turns out to be very valuable

03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:45.840
from a gameplay standpoint.

03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:48.240
So it winds up being kind of a perfect storm

03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:50.120
of all of these things that are really good.

03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:52.120
It doesn't have any of the comfort problems.

03:25:52.120 --> 03:25:53.480
You're not navigating around.

03:25:53.480 --> 03:25:54.720
You're standing still.

03:25:54.720 --> 03:25:56.680
All the stuff flies at you.

03:25:56.680 --> 03:25:59.440
It has placed audio strengths.

03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:01.640
It adds the whole fitness in VR.

03:26:01.640 --> 03:26:04.560
Nobody was thinking about that back at the beginning.

03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:07.440
And it turns out that that is an excellent

03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:09.080
daily fitness thing to be doing.

03:26:09.080 --> 03:26:11.920
If you go play an hour of Beat Saver

03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:13.520
or Supernatural or something,

03:26:13.520 --> 03:26:16.440
that is legit solid exercise.

03:26:16.440 --> 03:26:18.000
And it's more fun than doing it

03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:19.920
just about any other way there.

03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:23.480
So that's kind of the arcade stage of things.

03:26:23.480 --> 03:26:27.160
If I were to say with my experience with VR,

03:26:27.160 --> 03:26:30.640
the thing that I think is powerful is the,

03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:32.600
maybe it's not here yet,

03:26:32.600 --> 03:26:35.120
but the degree to which it is immersive

03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:38.400
in the way that Quake is immersive.

03:26:38.400 --> 03:26:40.240
It takes you to another world.

03:26:40.240 --> 03:26:43.080
For me, because I'm a fan of role-playing games,

03:26:44.360 --> 03:26:47.160
the Elder Scrolls series,

03:26:47.160 --> 03:26:50.240
like Skyrim or even Daggerfall,

03:26:50.240 --> 03:26:52.560
it just takes you to another world.

03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:53.960
And when you're not in that world,

03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:56.000
you miss not being there.

03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:58.880
And then you just, you kind of want to stay there forever

03:26:58.880 --> 03:27:01.040
because life is shitty.

03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:04.360
The whole point of my pitch for VR

03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:09.360
is that there was a time when we were kind of asked

03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:12.120
to come up with like, what's your view about VR?

03:27:12.120 --> 03:27:15.640
And my pitch was that it should be better

03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:17.240
inside the headset than outside.

03:27:17.240 --> 03:27:19.480
It's the world as you want it.

03:27:19.480 --> 03:27:21.680
And everybody thought that was dystopian

03:27:21.680 --> 03:27:24.120
and that's like, oh, you're just gonna forget

03:27:24.120 --> 03:27:25.600
about the world outside.

03:27:25.600 --> 03:27:29.720
And I don't get that mindset where the idea

03:27:29.720 --> 03:27:31.520
that if you can make the world better

03:27:31.520 --> 03:27:34.160
inside the headset than outside,

03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:36.200
you've just improved the person's life

03:27:36.200 --> 03:27:38.520
that has a headset that can wear it.

03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:41.280
And there are plenty of things that we just can't do

03:27:41.280 --> 03:27:42.400
for everyone in the real world.

03:27:42.400 --> 03:27:44.920
Everybody can't have Richard Branson's private island,

03:27:44.920 --> 03:27:47.240
but everyone can have a private VR island

03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:49.160
and it can have the things that they want on it.

03:27:49.160 --> 03:27:51.640
And there's a lot of these kind of rivalrous goods

03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:55.600
in the real world that VR can just be better at.

03:27:55.600 --> 03:27:57.760
We can do a lot of things like that

03:27:57.760 --> 03:27:59.640
that can be very, very rich.

03:28:00.640 --> 03:28:02.880
I think it's gonna be a positive thing, this world,

03:28:02.880 --> 03:28:05.440
where people want to go back into their headset,

03:28:05.440 --> 03:28:08.280
where it can be better than somebody that's living in

03:28:08.280 --> 03:28:10.880
a tiny apartment, can have a palatial estate

03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:12.920
in virtual reality, they can have all their friends

03:28:12.920 --> 03:28:15.560
from all over the world come over and visit them

03:28:15.560 --> 03:28:17.240
without everybody getting on a plane

03:28:17.240 --> 03:28:19.320
and meeting in some place

03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:21.640
and dealing with all the other logistics hassles.

03:28:21.640 --> 03:28:25.440
There is real value in the presence that you can get

03:28:25.440 --> 03:28:26.560
for remote meetings.

03:28:26.560 --> 03:28:30.120
It's all the little things that we need to sort out,

03:28:30.120 --> 03:28:32.880
but those are things that we have line of sight on.

03:28:32.880 --> 03:28:37.160
People that have been in a good VR meeting using workrooms

03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:40.440
where you can say, oh, that was better than a Zoom meeting.

03:28:40.440 --> 03:28:42.960
But of course, it's more of a hassle to get into it.

03:28:42.960 --> 03:28:46.280
Not everyone has the headset, interoperability is worse.

03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:48.640
You can't have, you cap out at a certain number.

03:28:48.640 --> 03:28:50.640
There's all these things that need to be fixed,

03:28:50.640 --> 03:28:52.360
but that's one of those things you can look at and say,

03:28:52.360 --> 03:28:54.240
we know there's value there.

03:28:54.280 --> 03:28:56.360
We just need to really grind hard,

03:28:56.360 --> 03:28:59.520
file off all the rough edges and make that possible.

03:28:59.520 --> 03:29:02.120
So you do think we have line of sight

03:29:02.120 --> 03:29:05.600
because there's a reason,

03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:09.560
like I do this podcast in person, for example,

03:29:11.160 --> 03:29:14.120
doing it remotely, it's not the same.

03:29:14.120 --> 03:29:17.000
And if somebody were to ask me why it's not the same,

03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.300
I wouldn't be able to write down exactly why.

03:29:20.640 --> 03:29:23.440
But you're saying that it's possible,

03:29:23.440 --> 03:29:27.040
whatever the magic is for in-person interaction,

03:29:27.040 --> 03:29:32.040
that immersiveness of the experience, we are almost there.

03:29:32.240 --> 03:29:33.080
Yes.

03:29:33.080 --> 03:29:34.440
So it's a technical problem.

03:29:34.440 --> 03:29:37.800
I'm doing a VR interview with someone.

03:29:37.800 --> 03:29:39.680
I'm not saying it's here right now,

03:29:39.680 --> 03:29:42.720
but you can see glimmers of what it should be.

03:29:42.720 --> 03:29:46.120
And we largely know what would need to be fixed

03:29:46.120 --> 03:29:48.120
and improved to, like you say,

03:29:48.120 --> 03:29:50.680
there's a difference between a remote interview,

03:29:50.680 --> 03:29:54.000
doing a podcast over Zoom or something and face-to-face.

03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:56.560
There's that sense of presence, that immediacy,

03:29:56.560 --> 03:29:59.160
the super low latency responsiveness,

03:29:59.160 --> 03:30:01.520
being able to see all the subtle things there,

03:30:01.520 --> 03:30:03.880
just occupying the same field of view.

03:30:03.880 --> 03:30:04.960
And all of those are things

03:30:04.960 --> 03:30:07.840
that we absolutely can do in VR.

03:30:07.840 --> 03:30:10.560
And that simple case of a small meeting

03:30:10.560 --> 03:30:13.140
with a couple of people, that's the much easier case

03:30:13.140 --> 03:30:15.380
than everybody thinks the Ready Player One multiverse

03:30:15.380 --> 03:30:18.520
with a thousand people going across a huge bridge

03:30:18.520 --> 03:30:20.120
to amazing places.

03:30:20.120 --> 03:30:22.520
That's harder in a lot of other technical ways,

03:30:22.520 --> 03:30:24.200
not to say we can't also do that,

03:30:24.200 --> 03:30:26.640
but that's further away and has more challenges.

03:30:26.640 --> 03:30:29.760
But this small thing about being able to have a meeting

03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:33.920
with one or a few people and have it feel real,

03:30:33.920 --> 03:30:35.600
feel like you're there,

03:30:35.600 --> 03:30:37.960
like you have the same interactions and talking with them,

03:30:37.960 --> 03:30:41.400
you get subtle cues as we start getting eye and face tracking

03:30:41.400 --> 03:30:43.960
and some of the other things on high-end headsets,

03:30:43.960 --> 03:30:46.440
a lot of that is going to come over.

03:30:46.440 --> 03:30:49.200
And it doesn't have to be as good.

03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:51.120
This is an important thing that people miss

03:30:51.120 --> 03:30:54.120
where there was a lot of people that,

03:30:54.120 --> 03:30:56.840
especially rich people that would look at VR

03:30:56.840 --> 03:30:59.800
and say it's like, oh, this just isn't that good.

03:30:59.800 --> 03:31:01.000
And I'd say it's like, well,

03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:05.120
you've already been courtside backstage and on pit row,

03:31:05.120 --> 03:31:07.040
and you've done all of these experiences

03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:08.760
because you get to do them in real life,

03:31:08.760 --> 03:31:10.720
but most people don't get to.

03:31:10.720 --> 03:31:13.400
And even if the experience is only half as good,

03:31:13.400 --> 03:31:15.080
if it's something that they never would have gotten

03:31:15.080 --> 03:31:17.800
to do before, it's still a very good thing.

03:31:17.800 --> 03:31:20.920
And as we can just, we can push that number up over time.

03:31:20.920 --> 03:31:24.160
It has a minimum viable value level

03:31:24.160 --> 03:31:27.240
when it does something that is valuable enough to people,

03:31:27.240 --> 03:31:30.000
as long as it's better inside the headset on any metric

03:31:30.000 --> 03:31:32.680
than it is outside and people choose to go there,

03:31:32.680 --> 03:31:34.040
we're on the right path.

03:31:34.040 --> 03:31:35.640
And we have a value gradient

03:31:35.640 --> 03:31:37.120
that I'm just always hammering on.

03:31:37.120 --> 03:31:39.080
We can just follow this value gradient,

03:31:39.080 --> 03:31:41.040
just keep making things better

03:31:41.040 --> 03:31:43.840
rather than going for that one,

03:31:43.840 --> 03:31:46.360
close your eyes, swing for the fences,

03:31:46.360 --> 03:31:48.760
kind of silver bullet approach.

03:31:48.760 --> 03:31:50.520
Well, I wonder if there's a value gradient

03:31:50.520 --> 03:31:53.480
for in-person meetings, because if you get that right,

03:31:53.480 --> 03:31:54.960
I mean, that would change the world.

03:31:54.960 --> 03:31:55.800
Yeah.

03:31:55.800 --> 03:31:57.040
That it doesn't need to,

03:31:57.040 --> 03:31:59.400
I mean, you don't need Ready Player One,

03:31:59.400 --> 03:32:02.800
but I wonder if there's that value gradient

03:32:02.800 --> 03:32:05.120
you can follow along.

03:32:05.120 --> 03:32:08.040
Because if there is and you follow it,

03:32:08.040 --> 03:32:11.520
then there'll be a certain like phase shift,

03:32:11.520 --> 03:32:14.680
it's a certain point where people will shift

03:32:14.680 --> 03:32:18.680
from Zoom to this.

03:32:18.680 --> 03:32:23.280
I wonder, what are the bottlenecks?

03:32:23.280 --> 03:32:25.440
Is it software, is it hardware?

03:32:25.440 --> 03:32:27.880
Is it like, is it all about latency?

03:32:27.880 --> 03:32:30.520
So I have big arguments internally

03:32:30.520 --> 03:32:32.800
about strategic things like that,

03:32:32.800 --> 03:32:36.680
where like the next headset that's coming out

03:32:36.680 --> 03:32:39.040
and that we've made various announcements about

03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:40.560
is gonna be a higher end headset,

03:32:40.560 --> 03:32:42.040
more expensive, more features.

03:32:42.040 --> 03:32:45.560
Lots of people wanna make those trade-offs.

03:32:45.560 --> 03:32:47.200
We'll see what the market has to say

03:32:47.200 --> 03:32:49.800
about the exact trade-offs we've made here.

03:32:49.800 --> 03:32:51.480
But if you wanna replace Zoom,

03:32:51.480 --> 03:32:53.800
you need to have something that everybody has.

03:32:55.200 --> 03:32:56.480
So you like cheaper.

03:32:56.480 --> 03:33:00.160
I like cheaper because also lighter and cheaper

03:33:00.160 --> 03:33:03.360
wind up being a virtuous cycle there,

03:33:03.360 --> 03:33:05.600
where expensive and more features

03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:07.280
tends to also lead towards heavier.

03:33:07.280 --> 03:33:09.680
And it just kind of goes, it's like, let's add more features.

03:33:09.680 --> 03:33:13.400
The features are not, they have physical presence

03:33:13.400 --> 03:33:16.200
and weight and draw from batteries and all of those things.

03:33:16.200 --> 03:33:19.240
So I've always favored a lower end,

03:33:19.240 --> 03:33:21.400
cheaper, faster approach.

03:33:21.400 --> 03:33:24.400
That's why I was always behind the mobile side of VR

03:33:24.400 --> 03:33:26.760
rather than the higher end PC headsets.

03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:29.480
And I think that's proven out well,

03:33:29.480 --> 03:33:32.960
but there's, ideally we have a whole range of things,

03:33:32.960 --> 03:33:35.440
but if you've only got one or two things,

03:33:35.440 --> 03:33:38.960
it's important that those two things cover the scope

03:33:38.960 --> 03:33:40.600
that you think is most important.

03:33:40.600 --> 03:33:42.520
When we're in a world when it's like cell phones

03:33:42.520 --> 03:33:44.040
and there's 50 of them on the market

03:33:44.040 --> 03:33:47.040
covering every conceivable ecological niche you want,

03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:47.960
that's gonna be great,

03:33:47.960 --> 03:33:49.960
but we're not gonna be there for a while.

03:33:49.960 --> 03:33:51.640
Where are the bottlenecks?

03:33:51.640 --> 03:33:53.440
Is it the hardware or the software?

03:33:53.440 --> 03:33:56.360
Yeah, so right now you can play,

03:33:56.360 --> 03:33:58.920
you can get workrooms on Quest

03:33:58.920 --> 03:34:00.400
and you can set up these things

03:34:00.400 --> 03:34:01.760
and it's a pretty good experience.

03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:02.760
It's surprisingly good.

03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:03.760
I haven't tried it.

03:34:03.760 --> 03:34:05.840
It's surprisingly good.

03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:08.160
The voice latency is better on that

03:34:08.760 --> 03:34:10.120
and a lot better than a Zoom meeting.

03:34:10.120 --> 03:34:13.560
So you've got a better sense of immediacy there.

03:34:13.560 --> 03:34:17.080
The expressions that you get from the current hardware

03:34:17.080 --> 03:34:20.080
with just kind of your controllers and your head

03:34:20.080 --> 03:34:21.560
is pretty realistic feeling.

03:34:21.560 --> 03:34:23.320
You've got a pretty good sense of being there

03:34:23.320 --> 03:34:24.160
with someone with it.

03:34:24.160 --> 03:34:27.520
Are these like avatars of people?

03:34:27.520 --> 03:34:28.640
Yeah.

03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:29.920
Do you get to see their body?

03:34:29.920 --> 03:34:31.000
Yeah.

03:34:31.000 --> 03:34:32.440
And they're sitting around a table?

03:34:32.440 --> 03:34:33.320
Yeah.

03:34:33.320 --> 03:34:36.240
And it feels better than Zoom?

03:34:36.240 --> 03:34:37.800
Yeah, better than you'd expect for that.

03:34:37.800 --> 03:34:42.200
It is definitely, yeah, I'd say it's quite a bit better

03:34:42.200 --> 03:34:43.920
than Zoom when everything's working right,

03:34:43.920 --> 03:34:46.480
but there's still all the rough edges of,

03:34:46.480 --> 03:34:48.240
the reason Zoom became so successful

03:34:48.240 --> 03:34:51.040
is because they just nailed the usability of everything.

03:34:51.040 --> 03:34:54.960
It's high quality with a absolutely first rate experience

03:34:54.960 --> 03:34:58.040
and we are not there yet with any of the VR stuff.

03:34:58.040 --> 03:35:00.480
I'm trying to push hard to get,

03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:02.440
I keep talking about it's like,

03:35:02.440 --> 03:35:05.040
it needs to just be one click to make everything happen

03:35:05.040 --> 03:35:07.640
and we're getting there in our home environment,

03:35:07.640 --> 03:35:09.320
not the whole workroom's application,

03:35:09.320 --> 03:35:11.760
but the main home where you can now kind of go over

03:35:11.760 --> 03:35:14.320
and click an invite and it still winds up taking

03:35:14.320 --> 03:35:16.320
five times longer than it should,

03:35:16.320 --> 03:35:19.520
but we're getting close to that where you click there,

03:35:19.520 --> 03:35:22.040
they click on their button and then they're sitting there

03:35:22.040 --> 03:35:23.880
in this good presence with you,

03:35:23.880 --> 03:35:25.920
but latencies need to get a lot better.

03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:28.800
User interface needs to get a lot better.

03:35:28.800 --> 03:35:30.920
Ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better.

03:35:30.920 --> 03:35:33.800
We need to have a hundred million of them out there

03:35:33.800 --> 03:35:35.440
just so that everybody knows somebody

03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:37.280
that uses this all the time.

03:35:37.320 --> 03:35:38.560
Well, I think it's a virtuous cycle

03:35:38.560 --> 03:35:42.800
because I do think the interface

03:35:44.160 --> 03:35:48.160
is the thing that makes or breaks this kind of revolution.

03:35:48.160 --> 03:35:50.880
It's so interesting how like you said one click,

03:35:50.880 --> 03:35:54.000
but it's also like how you achieve that one click.

03:35:54.000 --> 03:35:55.120
I don't know, what is,

03:35:57.240 --> 03:35:58.600
can I ask a dark question?

03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:00.680
Maybe let's keep it outside of meta,

03:36:00.680 --> 03:36:05.040
but this is about meta, but also Google and big company.

03:36:05.040 --> 03:36:07.960
Are they able to do this kind of thing?

03:36:07.960 --> 03:36:12.200
It seems like, let me put on my cranky old man hat,

03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:15.680
is they seem to not do a good job

03:36:15.680 --> 03:36:20.520
of creating these user-friendly interfaces

03:36:20.520 --> 03:36:22.920
as they get bigger and bigger as a company.

03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:25.480
Like Google has created some of the greatest interfaces

03:36:25.480 --> 03:36:30.360
ever early on and it's, I mean, creating Gmail,

03:36:30.360 --> 03:36:34.160
just so many brilliant interfaces

03:36:34.360 --> 03:36:36.000
and it just seems to be getting crappier

03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:37.280
and crappier at that.

03:36:37.280 --> 03:36:42.280
Same with meta, same with Microsoft.

03:36:42.840 --> 03:36:45.080
It seems to get worse and worse at that.

03:36:45.080 --> 03:36:46.160
I don't know what is it,

03:36:46.160 --> 03:36:47.680
because you've become more conservative,

03:36:47.680 --> 03:36:50.040
careful, risk averse.

03:36:50.040 --> 03:36:51.200
Is that why?

03:36:51.200 --> 03:36:52.040
Can you speak to that?

03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:53.560
So it's been really eye-opening to me

03:36:53.560 --> 03:36:55.480
working inside a tech titan,

03:36:55.480 --> 03:36:59.520
where I had my small companies

03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:03.560
and then we're acquired by a mid-size game publisher

03:37:03.560 --> 03:37:06.640
and then Oculus getting acquired by meta

03:37:06.640 --> 03:37:08.920
and meta has grown by a factor of many

03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:13.040
just in the eight years since the acquisition.

03:37:13.040 --> 03:37:16.320
So I did not have experience with this

03:37:16.320 --> 03:37:19.240
and it was interesting because I remember

03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:23.080
previously my benchmark for kind of use of resources

03:37:23.080 --> 03:37:24.480
was some of the government programs

03:37:24.480 --> 03:37:26.920
I interacted with on the aerospace side

03:37:26.920 --> 03:37:28.920
and I remember thinking there was,

03:37:28.920 --> 03:37:30.400
okay, there's an Air Force program

03:37:30.400 --> 03:37:31.880
and they spent $50 million

03:37:31.880 --> 03:37:34.400
and they didn't launch anything.

03:37:34.400 --> 03:37:35.560
They didn't even build anything.

03:37:35.560 --> 03:37:39.080
It was just kind of like they made a bunch of papers

03:37:39.080 --> 03:37:41.280
and had some parts in a warehouse

03:37:41.280 --> 03:37:42.120
and nothing came of it.

03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:43.440
It was like $50 million.

03:37:45.440 --> 03:37:48.520
And I've had to radically recalibrate my sense

03:37:48.520 --> 03:37:53.520
of how much money can be spent with mediocre resources,

03:37:54.080 --> 03:37:56.720
where on the plus side,

03:37:56.720 --> 03:38:01.280
VR has turned out we've built pretty much exactly

03:38:02.240 --> 03:38:03.880
we just passed the 10-year mark then

03:38:03.880 --> 03:38:06.920
from my first demo of the Rift

03:38:06.920 --> 03:38:09.560
and if I could have said what I wanted to have,

03:38:09.560 --> 03:38:12.080
it would have been a standalone inside out

03:38:12.080 --> 03:38:14.880
tracked 4K resolution headset

03:38:14.880 --> 03:38:18.360
that could still plug into a PC for high-end rendering

03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:21.280
and that's exactly what we've got on Quest 2 right now.

03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:22.600
First of all, let's pause on that

03:38:22.600 --> 03:38:25.320
with me being cranky and everything.

03:38:25.320 --> 03:38:30.160
What meta achieved with Oculus and so on is incredible.

03:38:30.160 --> 03:38:34.040
I mean, when I thought about the future of VR,

03:38:34.040 --> 03:38:36.720
this is what I imagined in terms of hardware, I would say

03:38:36.720 --> 03:38:39.240
and maybe in terms of the experience as well,

03:38:39.240 --> 03:38:42.080
but it's still not there somehow.

03:38:42.080 --> 03:38:44.600
On the one hand, we did kind of achieve it and win

03:38:44.600 --> 03:38:48.160
and we're a success right now,

03:38:48.160 --> 03:38:51.240
but the amount of resources that have gone into it,

03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:53.520
it winds up getting cluttered up in accounting

03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:58.360
where Mark did announce that they spent $10 billion a year

03:38:58.360 --> 03:38:59.520
like on Reality Labs.

03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:02.400
Now, Reality Labs covers a lot.

03:39:02.400 --> 03:39:04.320
VR was not the large part of it.

03:39:04.320 --> 03:39:05.840
It also had Portal and Spark

03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:08.200
and the big AR research efforts

03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:11.080
and it's been expanding out to include AI

03:39:11.080 --> 03:39:15.560
and other things there where there's a lot going on there,

03:39:15.560 --> 03:39:18.160
but $10 billion was just a number

03:39:18.160 --> 03:39:20.880
that I had trouble processing.

03:39:20.880 --> 03:39:22.480
I feel sick to my stomach

03:39:22.480 --> 03:39:25.000
thinking about that much money being spent,

03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:27.840
but that's how they demonstrate commitment to this

03:39:27.840 --> 03:39:31.440
where it's not more so than like, yeah,

03:39:31.440 --> 03:39:34.080
Google goes and cancels all of these projects,

03:39:34.080 --> 03:39:36.080
different things like that,

03:39:36.080 --> 03:39:39.520
while Meta is really sticking with the funding of VR

03:39:39.520 --> 03:39:41.880
and AR is still further out with it.

03:39:41.880 --> 03:39:44.800
So there's something to be said for that.

03:39:44.800 --> 03:39:46.960
It's not just gonna vanish, the work's going in.

03:39:46.960 --> 03:39:48.760
I just wish it could be,

03:39:48.760 --> 03:39:51.720
all those resources could be applied more effectively

03:39:51.720 --> 03:39:53.760
because I see all these cases,

03:39:53.760 --> 03:39:56.920
I point out these examples of how a third party

03:39:56.920 --> 03:39:58.960
that we're kind of competing with in various ways.

03:39:58.960 --> 03:40:00.600
There's a number of these examples

03:40:00.600 --> 03:40:03.840
and they do work with a 10th of the people

03:40:03.840 --> 03:40:05.840
that we do internally.

03:40:05.840 --> 03:40:08.080
And a lot of it comes from, yes,

03:40:08.080 --> 03:40:10.080
the small company can just go do it

03:40:10.080 --> 03:40:12.920
while in a big company, you do have to worry about,

03:40:13.880 --> 03:40:16.800
is there some SDK internally that you should be using

03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:18.200
because another team's making it,

03:40:18.200 --> 03:40:21.080
you have to have your cross-functional group meetups

03:40:21.080 --> 03:40:22.280
for different things.

03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:25.280
You do have more concerns about privacy

03:40:25.280 --> 03:40:28.920
or diversity and equity and safety of different things,

03:40:28.920 --> 03:40:31.920
parental issues and things that a small startup company

03:40:31.920 --> 03:40:36.560
can just kind of cowboy off and do something interesting.

03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:39.440
And there's a lot more that is a problem

03:40:39.440 --> 03:40:41.480
that you have to pay attention to in the big companies,

03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:43.880
but I'm not willing to believe that we are within

03:40:43.880 --> 03:40:46.320
even a factor of two or four

03:40:46.320 --> 03:40:48.840
of what the efficiency could be.

03:40:48.840 --> 03:40:51.800
I am constantly kind of crying out for,

03:40:51.800 --> 03:40:53.480
it's like, we can do better than this.

03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:55.160
And you wonder what the mechanisms

03:40:55.160 --> 03:40:57.640
to unlock that efficiency are.

03:40:59.480 --> 03:41:01.680
There is some sense in a large company

03:41:02.560 --> 03:41:05.760
that like an individual engineer might not believe

03:41:05.760 --> 03:41:07.200
that they can change the world.

03:41:07.200 --> 03:41:11.480
Maybe you delegate a little bit of the responsibility

03:41:11.480 --> 03:41:14.480
to be the one who changes the world in a big company,

03:41:14.480 --> 03:41:19.480
I think, but the reality is like the world will get changed

03:41:19.480 --> 03:41:21.400
by a single engineer anyway.

03:41:21.440 --> 03:41:24.440
So if whether inside Google or inside a startup,

03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:27.200
it doesn't matter, it's just like Google and Metta

03:41:27.200 --> 03:41:29.760
needs to help those engineers believe.

03:41:29.760 --> 03:41:32.880
They're the ones that are gonna decrease that latency.

03:41:32.880 --> 03:41:37.240
It'll take one John Carmack, the 20 year old Carmack

03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:40.640
that's inside Metta right now to change everything.

03:41:40.640 --> 03:41:43.120
And I try to point that out and push people.

03:41:43.120 --> 03:41:46.040
It's like, try to go ahead and when you see some,

03:41:46.040 --> 03:41:48.360
because there is, you get the silo mentality

03:41:48.360 --> 03:41:50.480
where you're like, okay, I know something's not right

03:41:50.920 --> 03:41:53.760
over there, but that's, I'm staying in my lane here.

03:41:53.760 --> 03:41:57.360
And there's a couple people that I can think about

03:41:57.360 --> 03:41:59.560
that are willing to just like hop all over the place.

03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:01.120
And man, I treasure them.

03:42:01.120 --> 03:42:03.960
The people that are just willing to, they're fearless.

03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:06.360
They will go over and they will go rebuild the kernel

03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:08.240
and change this distribution and go in

03:42:08.240 --> 03:42:11.840
and hack a firmware over here to get something done right.

03:42:11.840 --> 03:42:14.200
And that is relatively rare.

03:42:14.200 --> 03:42:15.760
There's thousands of developers

03:42:15.760 --> 03:42:18.240
and you've got a small handful that are willing to operate

03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:19.520
at that level.

03:42:19.520 --> 03:42:22.120
And it's potentially risky for them.

03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:24.920
The politics are real in a lot of that.

03:42:24.920 --> 03:42:28.120
And I'm in the very much the privileged position of,

03:42:29.440 --> 03:42:31.320
I'm more or less untouchable there

03:42:31.320 --> 03:42:33.680
where I've been dinged like twice for it's like,

03:42:33.680 --> 03:42:35.720
you said something insensitive in that post

03:42:35.720 --> 03:42:38.920
and you should probably not say that.

03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:42.280
But for the most part, yes, I get away with,

03:42:42.280 --> 03:42:45.040
every week I'm posting something pretty loud

03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:47.440
and opinionated internally.

03:42:47.440 --> 03:42:50.200
And I think that's useful for the company,

03:42:50.200 --> 03:42:54.840
but yeah, it's rare to have a position like that.

03:42:54.840 --> 03:42:56.600
And I can't necessarily offer advice

03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:59.000
for how someone can do that.

03:42:59.000 --> 03:43:01.480
Well, you could offer advice to a company in general

03:43:01.480 --> 03:43:06.360
to give a little bit of freedom for the young wild,

03:43:06.360 --> 03:43:09.640
the wildest ideas come from the young minds.

03:43:10.720 --> 03:43:13.040
And so you need to give the young minds freedom

03:43:13.040 --> 03:43:16.400
to think big and wild and crazy.

03:43:16.440 --> 03:43:18.600
And for that, they have to be opinionated.

03:43:18.600 --> 03:43:23.600
They have to be, they have to think crazy ideas

03:43:23.640 --> 03:43:26.320
and thoughts and pursue them with a full passion

03:43:26.320 --> 03:43:29.240
without being slowed down by bureaucracy or managers

03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:31.120
and all that kind of stuff.

03:43:31.120 --> 03:43:33.080
Obviously startups really empower that,

03:43:33.080 --> 03:43:34.280
but big companies could too.

03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:38.000
And that's a design challenge for big companies

03:43:38.000 --> 03:43:40.200
to see how can you enable that?

03:43:40.200 --> 03:43:41.040
How can you empower that?

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:41.880
Yeah, because the big company,

03:43:41.880 --> 03:43:43.640
there are so many resources there.

03:43:43.640 --> 03:43:46.600
And they do, amazing things do get accomplished,

03:43:46.600 --> 03:43:49.800
but there's so much more that could come out of that.

03:43:49.800 --> 03:43:51.520
And I'm always hopeful.

03:43:51.520 --> 03:43:53.240
I'm an optimist in almost everything.

03:43:53.240 --> 03:43:55.000
I think things can get better.

03:43:55.000 --> 03:43:56.800
I think that they can improve things,

03:43:56.800 --> 03:43:59.480
that you go through a path and you're learning

03:43:59.480 --> 03:44:01.440
kind of what does and doesn't work.

03:44:01.440 --> 03:44:04.560
And I'm not ready to be fatalistic about

03:44:04.560 --> 03:44:06.840
kind of the outcome of any of that.

03:44:06.840 --> 03:44:07.680
Me neither.

03:44:07.680 --> 03:44:10.560
I know too many good people inside of those large companies

03:44:10.560 --> 03:44:12.440
that are incredible.

03:44:12.440 --> 03:44:16.080
You have a friendship with Elon Musk.

03:44:16.080 --> 03:44:17.400
Often when I talk to him,

03:44:17.400 --> 03:44:19.640
he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer

03:44:19.640 --> 03:44:22.440
and just a big picture thinker you are.

03:44:22.440 --> 03:44:26.280
His huge amount of respect for you.

03:44:26.280 --> 03:44:28.920
I just, I've never been a fly in the wall

03:44:28.920 --> 03:44:30.600
between a discussion between the two of you.

03:44:30.600 --> 03:44:34.960
I just wonder, is there something you guys debate,

03:44:34.960 --> 03:44:36.800
argue about, discuss?

03:44:36.800 --> 03:44:38.280
Is there some interesting problems

03:44:38.280 --> 03:44:41.240
that the two of you think about?

03:44:41.240 --> 03:44:42.440
You come from different worlds.

03:44:42.440 --> 03:44:45.840
Maybe there's some intersection in aerospace.

03:44:45.840 --> 03:44:50.320
Maybe there's some intersection in your new efforts

03:44:50.320 --> 03:44:53.560
in artificial intelligence in terms of thinking.

03:44:53.560 --> 03:44:55.120
Is there something interesting you could say

03:44:55.120 --> 03:44:57.320
about sort of the debates the two of you have?

03:44:57.320 --> 03:44:59.600
So I think in some ways we do have

03:44:59.600 --> 03:45:01.280
a kind of similar background

03:45:01.280 --> 03:45:03.520
where we're almost exactly the same age

03:45:03.520 --> 03:45:06.400
and we had kind of similar programming backgrounds

03:45:06.400 --> 03:45:09.840
on the personal computers and even some of the books

03:45:09.840 --> 03:45:12.440
that we would read and things that would kind of turn us

03:45:12.440 --> 03:45:14.680
into the people that we are today.

03:45:14.680 --> 03:45:19.680
And I think there is a degree of sensibility similarities

03:45:19.680 --> 03:45:22.880
where we kind of call bullshit on the same things

03:45:22.880 --> 03:45:25.800
and kind of see the same opportunities

03:45:25.800 --> 03:45:27.200
in different technology.

03:45:27.200 --> 03:45:28.960
And there's that sense of,

03:45:28.960 --> 03:45:31.560
I always talk about the speed of light solutions for things

03:45:31.560 --> 03:45:34.880
and he's thinking about kind of minimum manufacturing

03:45:34.880 --> 03:45:38.960
and engineering and operational standpoints for things.

03:45:38.960 --> 03:45:42.200
And so, I mean, I first met Elon

03:45:42.200 --> 03:45:44.040
right at the start of the aerospace era

03:45:44.040 --> 03:45:46.160
where I wasn't familiar with...

03:45:46.160 --> 03:45:47.720
I was still in my game dev bubble.

03:45:47.720 --> 03:45:49.800
I really wasn't familiar with all the startups

03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:52.040
that were going and being successful

03:45:52.040 --> 03:45:53.680
and what went on with PayPal

03:45:53.680 --> 03:45:54.960
and all of his different companies.

03:45:54.960 --> 03:45:58.880
But I met him as I was starting to do Armadillo Aerospace

03:45:58.880 --> 03:46:03.080
and he came down with kind of his right-hand propulsion guy

03:46:03.080 --> 03:46:05.400
and we talked about rockets.

03:46:05.400 --> 03:46:07.240
What can we do with this?

03:46:07.240 --> 03:46:09.080
And it was kind of specific things

03:46:09.080 --> 03:46:12.120
about how are our flight computers set up?

03:46:12.120 --> 03:46:13.960
What are different propellant options?

03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:17.600
What can happen with different ways

03:46:17.600 --> 03:46:19.360
of putting things together?

03:46:19.360 --> 03:46:22.880
And then in some ways, he was certainly the biggest player

03:46:22.880 --> 03:46:25.760
in the sort of alt-space community that was going on

03:46:25.760 --> 03:46:28.080
in the early 2000s.

03:46:28.080 --> 03:46:30.600
He was the most well-funded,

03:46:30.600 --> 03:46:32.880
although his funding in the larger scheme of things

03:46:32.880 --> 03:46:36.800
compared to like a NASA or something like that

03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:38.240
was really tiny.

03:46:38.240 --> 03:46:40.520
It was a lot more than I had at the time,

03:46:41.680 --> 03:46:42.640
but it was interesting.

03:46:42.640 --> 03:46:45.560
I had a point years later when I realized,

03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:48.880
okay, my financial resources at this point

03:46:48.880 --> 03:46:51.720
are basically what Elon's was when he went all in

03:46:51.720 --> 03:46:54.360
on SpaceX and Tesla.

03:46:54.360 --> 03:46:58.360
And I think in many corners,

03:46:58.360 --> 03:47:01.120
he does not get the respect that he should

03:47:01.120 --> 03:47:04.960
about being a wealthy person that could just retire.

03:47:04.960 --> 03:47:08.720
And he went all in where he was really going to,

03:47:10.280 --> 03:47:12.560
he could have gone bust and there's plenty of people.

03:47:12.560 --> 03:47:16.800
You look at the sad athletes or entertainers

03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:18.600
that had all the money in the world and blew it.

03:47:18.600 --> 03:47:22.400
He could have been the business case example of that.

03:47:22.400 --> 03:47:25.440
But the things that he was doing,

03:47:25.440 --> 03:47:29.880
space exploration, electrification of transportation,

03:47:29.880 --> 03:47:34.560
solar city type things, these are big world level things.

03:47:35.080 --> 03:47:37.800
I have a great deal of admiration that he was willing

03:47:37.800 --> 03:47:40.720
to throw himself so completely into that

03:47:40.720 --> 03:47:43.080
because in contrast with myself,

03:47:43.080 --> 03:47:47.000
I was doing armadillo aerospace with this tightly bounded,

03:47:47.000 --> 03:47:49.560
it was John's crazy money at the time

03:47:49.560 --> 03:47:51.440
that had a finite limit on it.

03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:54.840
It was never going to impact me or my family

03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:56.560
if it completely failed.

03:47:56.560 --> 03:47:58.680
And I was still hedging my bets,

03:47:58.680 --> 03:48:01.080
working at id Software at the time

03:48:01.080 --> 03:48:04.960
when he had been really all in there.

03:48:04.960 --> 03:48:08.000
And I have a huge amount of respect for that.

03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:10.800
And people do not, the other thing I get irritated with

03:48:10.800 --> 03:48:11.760
is people would say, it's like,

03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:13.880
oh, Elon's just a business guy.

03:48:13.880 --> 03:48:16.520
He just got like, he was gifted the money

03:48:16.520 --> 03:48:19.440
and he's just kind of investing in all of this

03:48:19.440 --> 03:48:22.240
when he was really deeply involved

03:48:22.240 --> 03:48:24.520
in a lot of the decisions.

03:48:24.520 --> 03:48:25.800
Not all of them were perfect,

03:48:25.800 --> 03:48:30.400
but he cared very much about engine material selection,

03:48:30.400 --> 03:48:31.680
propellant selection.

03:48:31.680 --> 03:48:34.320
And for years, he'd be kind of telling me,

03:48:34.320 --> 03:48:37.000
it's like, get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff.

03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:40.880
It's like, liquid oxygen is the only proper oxidizer

03:48:40.880 --> 03:48:41.840
for this.

03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:45.440
And unlike the times that I've gone through

03:48:45.440 --> 03:48:47.000
the factories with him,

03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:50.200
we're talking very detailed things about

03:48:50.200 --> 03:48:51.840
how this weld is made,

03:48:51.840 --> 03:48:54.720
how this sub assembly goes together,

03:48:54.720 --> 03:48:57.560
what are startup shut down behaviors

03:48:57.560 --> 03:48:58.520
of the different things.

03:48:58.520 --> 03:49:03.440
So he is really in there at a very detailed level.

03:49:03.440 --> 03:49:06.960
And I think that he is the best modern example now

03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:08.560
of someone that tries to,

03:49:08.560 --> 03:49:11.880
that can effectively micromanage some decisions on things

03:49:11.880 --> 03:49:15.080
on both Tesla and SpaceX to some degree,

03:49:15.080 --> 03:49:16.920
where he cares enough about it.

03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:19.280
I worry a lot that he stretched too thin,

03:49:19.280 --> 03:49:22.960
that you get boring company and Neuralink and Twitter

03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:25.280
and all the other possible things there,

03:49:25.280 --> 03:49:29.000
where I know I've got limits on how much

03:49:29.000 --> 03:49:30.800
I can pay attention to,

03:49:30.800 --> 03:49:34.040
that I have to kind of box off different amounts of time.

03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:36.440
And I look back at like at my aerospace side of things,

03:49:36.440 --> 03:49:38.400
it's like, I did not go all in on that.

03:49:38.400 --> 03:49:40.640
I did not commit myself at a level

03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:43.480
that it would have taken to be successful there.

03:49:43.480 --> 03:49:46.440
And it's kind of a weird thing,

03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:49.000
just like having a discussion with him.

03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:50.840
He's the richest man in the world right now,

03:49:50.840 --> 03:49:55.200
but he operates on a level that is still

03:49:56.040 --> 03:50:00.160
very much in my wheelhouse on a technical side of things.

03:50:00.160 --> 03:50:01.000
So-

03:50:01.000 --> 03:50:02.440
That doing that systems level type of thinking

03:50:02.440 --> 03:50:04.880
where you can go to the low level of details

03:50:04.880 --> 03:50:07.400
and go up high to the big picture.

03:50:07.400 --> 03:50:12.400
Do you think in aerospace arena in the next five, 10 years,

03:50:14.480 --> 03:50:16.360
do you think we're gonna put a human on Mars?

03:50:16.360 --> 03:50:20.280
Like, what do you think is the interesting point?

03:50:20.280 --> 03:50:23.040
No, in fact, I made a bet with someone,

03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:24.840
with a group of people kind of this,

03:50:24.840 --> 03:50:28.400
about whether Boots on Mars by 2030.

03:50:28.400 --> 03:50:31.320
And this was kind of a fun story

03:50:31.320 --> 03:50:34.120
because I was at an Intel sponsored event

03:50:34.120 --> 03:50:37.400
and we had a bunch of just world-class brilliant people.

03:50:37.400 --> 03:50:39.120
And we were talking about computing stuff,

03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:41.520
but the after dinner conversation was like,

03:50:41.520 --> 03:50:42.360
what are some other things?

03:50:42.360 --> 03:50:43.920
How are they gonna go in the future?

03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:46.160
And one of the ones tossed up on the whiteboard

03:50:46.160 --> 03:50:49.040
was like Boots on Mars by 2030.

03:50:49.040 --> 03:50:52.280
And most of the people in the room thought, yes.

03:50:52.280 --> 03:50:54.440
They thought that like SpaceX is kicking ass.

03:50:54.440 --> 03:50:57.000
We've got all this possible stuff.

03:50:57.000 --> 03:50:59.440
Seems likely that it's gonna go that way.

03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:03.280
And I said, no, I think less than 50% chance

03:51:03.280 --> 03:51:05.440
that it's going to make it there.

03:51:05.440 --> 03:51:07.320
And people were kind of like,

03:51:07.320 --> 03:51:09.440
oh, why the pessimism or whatever?

03:51:09.440 --> 03:51:12.040
And of course, I'm an optimist at almost everything,

03:51:12.040 --> 03:51:14.800
but for me to be the one kind of outlier saying,

03:51:14.800 --> 03:51:16.160
no, I don't think so.

03:51:17.240 --> 03:51:19.400
Then I started saying some of the things I said,

03:51:19.400 --> 03:51:21.040
well, let's be concrete about it.

03:51:21.040 --> 03:51:24.880
Let's bet $10,000 that it's not gonna happen.

03:51:24.880 --> 03:51:29.800
And this was really a startling thing to see that I,

03:51:29.800 --> 03:51:31.640
again, room full of brilliant people,

03:51:31.640 --> 03:51:34.320
but as soon as like money came on the line

03:51:34.320 --> 03:51:36.680
and they were like, do I wanna put $10,000?

03:51:36.680 --> 03:51:38.800
I was not the richest person in the room.

03:51:38.800 --> 03:51:41.280
There were people much better off than I was.

03:51:41.280 --> 03:51:45.280
There's a spectrum, but as soon as they started to think,

03:51:45.280 --> 03:51:46.760
it's like, oh, I could lose money

03:51:46.760 --> 03:51:50.760
by keeping my position right now.

03:51:50.760 --> 03:51:53.440
And all these engineers, they engage their brain.

03:51:53.440 --> 03:51:55.160
They started thinking, it's like, okay,

03:51:55.160 --> 03:51:57.880
launch windows, launch delays,

03:51:57.880 --> 03:52:00.380
like how many times would it take to get this right?

03:52:00.380 --> 03:52:02.720
What historical precedents do we have?

03:52:02.720 --> 03:52:05.280
And then it mostly came down to,

03:52:05.280 --> 03:52:08.240
it's like, well, what about in transit by 2030?

03:52:08.240 --> 03:52:11.480
And then what about different things?

03:52:11.480 --> 03:52:13.920
Or would you go for 2032?

03:52:13.920 --> 03:52:15.800
But one of the people did go ahead

03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:18.340
and was optimistic enough to make a bet with me.

03:52:18.340 --> 03:52:22.020
So I have a $10,000 bet that by 2030,

03:52:22.020 --> 03:52:24.440
I think it's gonna happen shortly thereafter.

03:52:24.440 --> 03:52:26.500
I think there will probably be infrastructure on Mars

03:52:26.500 --> 03:52:30.020
by 2030, but I don't think that we'll have humans

03:52:30.020 --> 03:52:31.180
on Mars on 2030.

03:52:31.180 --> 03:52:32.340
I think it's possible,

03:52:32.340 --> 03:52:34.700
but I think it's less than a 50% chance.

03:52:34.700 --> 03:52:36.780
So I felt safe making that bet.

03:52:36.780 --> 03:52:40.020
Well, I think you had an interesting point.

03:52:40.020 --> 03:52:41.260
Correct me if I'm wrong.

03:52:41.260 --> 03:52:42.500
That's a dark one.

03:52:42.500 --> 03:52:47.500
That should perhaps help people appreciate Elon Musk.

03:52:48.820 --> 03:52:53.460
Which is, in this particular effort,

03:52:53.460 --> 03:52:56.860
Elon is critical to the success.

03:52:56.860 --> 03:53:01.380
SpaceX seems to be critical to the 20th,

03:53:01.380 --> 03:53:06.380
you know, humans on Mars by 2030 or thereabouts.

03:53:07.080 --> 03:53:09.200
So if something happens to Elon,

03:53:10.500 --> 03:53:13.780
then all of this collapses.

03:53:13.780 --> 03:53:17.500
And this is in contrast to the other $10,000 bet

03:53:17.500 --> 03:53:18.620
I made kind of recently,

03:53:18.620 --> 03:53:21.940
and that was self-driving cars at like a level five

03:53:21.940 --> 03:53:23.360
running around cities.

03:53:23.360 --> 03:53:25.340
And people have kind of nitpicked that,

03:53:25.340 --> 03:53:27.780
that we probably don't mean exactly level five,

03:53:27.780 --> 03:53:31.500
but the guy I'm having the bet with is we're gonna be,

03:53:31.500 --> 03:53:32.960
we know what we mean about this.

03:53:32.960 --> 03:53:33.900
Jeff Atwood.

03:53:33.900 --> 03:53:37.220
Yeah, coding horror and Stack Overflow and all.

03:53:37.220 --> 03:53:39.420
But yeah, I mean, it's just,

03:53:39.420 --> 03:53:41.740
he doesn't think that people are gonna be riding around

03:53:41.740 --> 03:53:45.140
in robo-taxis in 2030 in major cities,

03:53:45.140 --> 03:53:47.580
just like you take an Uber now.

03:53:47.580 --> 03:53:48.580
And I think it will.

03:53:48.580 --> 03:53:49.420
You think it will.

03:53:49.420 --> 03:53:50.540
And I think, and the difference is,

03:53:50.540 --> 03:53:51.740
everybody looks at this, it's like,

03:53:51.740 --> 03:53:53.580
oh, but Tesla's been wrong for years.

03:53:53.580 --> 03:53:54.980
They've been promising it for years,

03:53:54.980 --> 03:53:56.500
and it's not here yet.

03:53:56.500 --> 03:54:00.540
And the reason this is different than the bet with Mars

03:54:00.540 --> 03:54:04.260
is Mars really is, more than is comfortable,

03:54:04.260 --> 03:54:06.220
a bet on Elon Musk.

03:54:06.220 --> 03:54:09.340
I am, you know, that is, you know, that is his thing,

03:54:09.340 --> 03:54:11.940
and he is really going to move heaven and earth

03:54:11.940 --> 03:54:13.580
to try to make that happen.

03:54:13.580 --> 03:54:15.060
And perhaps not even SpaceX.

03:54:15.980 --> 03:54:17.980
Perhaps just Elon Musk.

03:54:17.980 --> 03:54:21.740
Yeah, because if Elon went away and SpaceX went public

03:54:21.740 --> 03:54:23.980
and got a board of directors,

03:54:23.980 --> 03:54:26.380
there are more profitable things they could be doing

03:54:26.380 --> 03:54:29.460
than focusing on human presence on Mars.

03:54:29.460 --> 03:54:32.740
So this really is a sort of personal thing there.

03:54:32.740 --> 03:54:36.260
And in contrast with that, self-driving cars

03:54:36.260 --> 03:54:40.620
have a dozen credible companies working really hard.

03:54:40.620 --> 03:54:43.340
And while, yes, it's going slower

03:54:43.340 --> 03:54:45.620
than most people thought it would,

03:54:45.620 --> 03:54:47.580
betting against that is a bet against

03:54:47.580 --> 03:54:51.060
almost the entire world in terms of all of these companies

03:54:51.060 --> 03:54:52.820
that have all of these incentives.

03:54:52.820 --> 03:54:56.700
It's not just, you know, one guy's passion project.

03:54:57.620 --> 03:54:59.820
And I do think that it is solvable,

03:54:59.820 --> 03:55:02.500
although there's, I recognize it's not 100% chance

03:55:02.500 --> 03:55:05.740
because it's possible the long tail of self-driving problems

03:55:05.740 --> 03:55:08.460
winds up being an AGI complete problem.

03:55:08.460 --> 03:55:10.740
I think there's plenty of value to mine out of it

03:55:10.740 --> 03:55:14.220
with narrow AI, and I think that it's going to happen

03:55:14.220 --> 03:55:16.500
probably more so than people expect.

03:55:16.500 --> 03:55:20.660
But it's that whole sigmoid curve where you overestimate

03:55:20.660 --> 03:55:22.500
the near-term progress and you underestimate

03:55:22.500 --> 03:55:23.940
the long-term progress.

03:55:23.940 --> 03:55:26.540
And I think self-driving is gonna be like that.

03:55:26.540 --> 03:55:29.860
And I think 2030 is still a pretty good bet.

03:55:29.860 --> 03:55:34.860
Yeah, unfortunately, self-driving is a problem

03:55:35.220 --> 03:55:40.220
that is safety critical, meaning that if you don't do it

03:55:40.860 --> 03:55:43.260
well, people get hurt.

03:55:43.260 --> 03:55:46.460
But the other side of that is people are terrible drivers.

03:55:46.460 --> 03:55:48.980
So it is not going to be, that's probably gonna be

03:55:48.980 --> 03:55:50.980
the argument that gets it through is like,

03:55:50.980 --> 03:55:55.420
we can save 10,000 lives a year by taking imperfect

03:55:55.420 --> 03:55:57.860
self-driving cars and letting them take over

03:55:57.860 --> 03:55:59.900
a lot of driving responsibilities.

03:55:59.900 --> 03:56:02.500
It's like, was it 30,000 people a year die

03:56:02.500 --> 03:56:04.820
in auto accidents right now in America?

03:56:04.820 --> 03:56:06.940
And a lot of those are preventable.

03:56:06.940 --> 03:56:09.580
And the problem is you'll have people that every time

03:56:09.620 --> 03:56:11.940
a Tesla crashes into something, you've got a bunch

03:56:11.940 --> 03:56:14.060
of people that literally have vested interest

03:56:14.060 --> 03:56:16.460
shorting Tesla to come out and make it the worst thing

03:56:16.460 --> 03:56:17.460
in the world.

03:56:17.460 --> 03:56:19.420
And people will be fighting against that.

03:56:19.420 --> 03:56:22.420
But, optimist in me again, I think that we will have

03:56:22.420 --> 03:56:26.260
systems that are statistically safer than human drivers.

03:56:26.260 --> 03:56:29.900
And we will be saving thousands and thousands of lives

03:56:29.900 --> 03:56:32.500
every year when we can hand over more of those

03:56:32.500 --> 03:56:34.260
responsibilities to it.

03:56:34.260 --> 03:56:37.140
I do still think, as a person who studied this problem

03:56:37.140 --> 03:56:41.020
very deeply from a human side as well,

03:56:41.020 --> 03:56:44.580
it's still an open problem how good slash bad

03:56:44.580 --> 03:56:46.420
humans are at driving.

03:56:46.420 --> 03:56:49.540
It's a kind of funny thing we say about each other.

03:56:49.540 --> 03:56:51.340
Oh, humans suck at driving.

03:56:52.380 --> 03:56:55.460
Everybody except you, of course, like we think

03:56:55.460 --> 03:56:56.780
we're good at driving.

03:56:56.780 --> 03:57:01.540
But I, after really studying it, I think you start

03:57:01.540 --> 03:57:05.740
to notice, you know, cause I watched hundreds of hours

03:57:05.740 --> 03:57:08.740
of humans driving with the projects of this kind of thing.

03:57:08.740 --> 03:57:11.780
You've noticed that even with the distraction,

03:57:11.780 --> 03:57:15.940
even with everything else, humans are able to do

03:57:15.940 --> 03:57:19.380
some incredible things with the attention,

03:57:19.380 --> 03:57:21.100
even when you're just looking at a smartphone,

03:57:21.100 --> 03:57:23.340
just to get cues from the environment,

03:57:23.340 --> 03:57:28.060
to make last second decisions, to use instinctual

03:57:28.060 --> 03:57:30.820
type of decisions that actually save your ass

03:57:30.820 --> 03:57:33.180
time and time and time again.

03:57:33.180 --> 03:57:37.100
And are able to do that with so much uncertainty

03:57:37.100 --> 03:57:40.860
around you in such tricky, dynamic environments.

03:57:40.860 --> 03:57:42.020
I don't know.

03:57:42.020 --> 03:57:47.020
I don't know exactly how hard is it to beat

03:57:47.100 --> 03:57:50.820
that kind of skill of common sense reasoning.

03:57:50.820 --> 03:57:52.740
So this is one of those interesting things

03:57:52.740 --> 03:57:54.940
that there have been a lot of studies about how

03:57:54.940 --> 03:57:57.780
experts in their field usually underestimate

03:57:57.780 --> 03:57:59.660
the progress that's going to happen,

03:57:59.660 --> 03:58:02.300
because an expert thinks about all the problems

03:58:02.300 --> 03:58:03.860
that they deal with and they're like,

03:58:03.860 --> 03:58:06.500
damn, I'm going to have a hard time solving all of this.

03:58:06.500 --> 03:58:08.860
And they filter out the fact that they are one expert

03:58:08.860 --> 03:58:10.580
in a field of thousands.

03:58:10.580 --> 03:58:13.420
And you know, you think about, yeah, I can't do all of that.

03:58:13.420 --> 03:58:16.740
And you sometimes forget about the scope of the ecosystem

03:58:16.740 --> 03:58:18.100
that you're embedded in.

03:58:18.100 --> 03:58:20.580
And if you think back eight years, very specifically,

03:58:20.580 --> 03:58:23.980
the state of AI and machine learning, where was that?

03:58:23.980 --> 03:58:26.820
We had just gotten ResNets probably at that point.

03:58:26.820 --> 03:58:29.780
And you look at all the amazing magical things

03:58:29.780 --> 03:58:31.420
that have happened in eight years.

03:58:31.460 --> 03:58:34.380
And they do kind of seem to be happening a little faster

03:58:34.380 --> 03:58:36.100
in recent years also.

03:58:36.100 --> 03:58:39.060
And you project that eight more years into the future,

03:58:39.060 --> 03:58:41.220
where again, I think there's a 50% chance

03:58:41.220 --> 03:58:43.860
we're going to have signs of life of AGI,

03:58:43.860 --> 03:58:46.420
which we can put through driver's ed if we need to,

03:58:46.420 --> 03:58:48.740
to actually build self-driving cars.

03:58:48.740 --> 03:58:51.420
And I think that the narrow systems are going to

03:58:51.420 --> 03:58:54.940
have real value demonstrated well before then.

03:58:54.940 --> 03:58:59.780
So signs of life in AGI, you've mentioned that,

03:59:00.780 --> 03:59:02.540
okay, first of all,

03:59:02.540 --> 03:59:04.980
you're one of the most brilliant people on this earth.

03:59:04.980 --> 03:59:08.100
You could be solving a number of different problems,

03:59:08.100 --> 03:59:09.380
as you've mentioned.

03:59:09.380 --> 03:59:12.340
Your mind was attracted to nuclear energy.

03:59:12.340 --> 03:59:14.660
Obviously, virtual reality with the metaverse

03:59:14.660 --> 03:59:16.700
is something you could have a tremendous impact on.

03:59:16.700 --> 03:59:19.220
So I do want to say a quick thing about nuclear energy,

03:59:19.220 --> 03:59:22.820
where I, you know, this is something that I really,

03:59:22.820 --> 03:59:27.260
this so precisely feels like aerospace before SpaceX,

03:59:27.260 --> 03:59:31.180
where from everything that I know about all of these,

03:59:31.180 --> 03:59:33.500
the physics of this stuff hasn't changed.

03:59:33.500 --> 03:59:36.660
And the reasons why things are expensive now

03:59:36.660 --> 03:59:38.060
are not fundamental.

03:59:39.180 --> 03:59:44.180
Somebody should be going into really hard Elon Musk style

03:59:44.620 --> 03:59:48.860
at fission, economical fission, not fusion,

03:59:48.860 --> 03:59:53.020
where the fusion is the kind of the darling of people

03:59:53.020 --> 03:59:54.580
that want to go and do nuclear,

03:59:54.580 --> 03:59:57.220
because it doesn't have the taint that fission has

03:59:58.220 --> 03:59:59.060
in a lot of people's minds.

03:59:59.060 --> 04:00:02.140
But it's an almost absurdly complex thing

04:00:02.140 --> 04:00:05.860
where nuclear fusion, as you look at the Tokamaks

04:00:05.860 --> 04:00:07.620
or any of the things that people are building,

04:00:07.620 --> 04:00:09.940
and it's doing all of this infrastructure

04:00:09.940 --> 04:00:12.940
just at the end of the day to make something hot

04:00:12.940 --> 04:00:14.740
that you can then turn into energy

04:00:14.740 --> 04:00:17.020
through a conventional power plant.

04:00:17.020 --> 04:00:18.220
And all of that work,

04:00:18.220 --> 04:00:20.660
which we think we've got line of sight on,

04:00:20.660 --> 04:00:22.100
but even if it comes out,

04:00:22.100 --> 04:00:25.020
then you have to do all of that immensely complex,

04:00:25.020 --> 04:00:27.380
expensive stuff just to make something hot,

04:00:27.380 --> 04:00:29.380
where nuclear fission is basically

04:00:29.380 --> 04:00:31.780
you put these two rocks together and they get hot

04:00:31.780 --> 04:00:33.140
all by themselves.

04:00:33.140 --> 04:00:35.220
That is just that much simpler.

04:00:35.220 --> 04:00:38.220
It's just orders of magnitude simpler.

04:00:38.220 --> 04:00:40.500
And the actual rocks, the refined uranium,

04:00:40.500 --> 04:00:41.900
is not very expensive.

04:00:41.900 --> 04:00:45.220
It's a couple percent of the cost of electricity.

04:00:45.220 --> 04:00:46.260
That's why I made that point

04:00:46.260 --> 04:00:47.660
where you could have something

04:00:47.660 --> 04:00:52.220
which was five times less efficient than current systems.

04:00:52.220 --> 04:00:54.180
And if the rest of the plant was a whole bunch cheaper,

04:00:54.180 --> 04:00:57.140
you could still be super, super valuable.

04:00:57.140 --> 04:00:59.900
So how much of the pie do you think

04:01:01.300 --> 04:01:04.460
could be solved by nuclear energy by fission?

04:01:04.460 --> 04:01:06.500
So how much could it become

04:01:06.500 --> 04:01:08.860
the primary source of energy on earth?

04:01:08.860 --> 04:01:10.060
It could be most of it.

04:01:10.060 --> 04:01:12.180
Like the reserves of uranium as it stands now

04:01:12.180 --> 04:01:13.660
could not power the whole earth,

04:01:13.660 --> 04:01:16.940
but you get into breeder reactors and thorium

04:01:16.940 --> 04:01:19.900
and things like that that you do for conventional fission.

04:01:19.900 --> 04:01:22.340
There is enough for everything.

04:01:22.340 --> 04:01:25.380
Now, I mean, solar photovoltaic has been amazing.

04:01:27.140 --> 04:01:29.940
One of my current projects is working on an off-grid system

04:01:29.940 --> 04:01:31.420
and it's been fun just kind of, again,

04:01:31.420 --> 04:01:33.100
putting my hands on all this,

04:01:33.100 --> 04:01:35.020
stripping the wires and wiring things together

04:01:35.020 --> 04:01:36.060
and doing all of that.

04:01:36.060 --> 04:01:39.020
And just having followed that a little bit from the outside

04:01:39.020 --> 04:01:40.900
over the last couple of decades,

04:01:40.900 --> 04:01:44.300
there's been semiconductor-like magical progress

04:01:44.300 --> 04:01:45.980
in what's going on there.

04:01:45.980 --> 04:01:48.020
So I'm all for all of that,

04:01:48.020 --> 04:01:49.580
but it doesn't solve everything

04:01:49.580 --> 04:01:53.380
and nuclear really still does seem like the smart money bet

04:01:53.380 --> 04:01:55.580
for what you should be getting for baseband

04:01:55.580 --> 04:01:56.980
on a lot of things.

04:01:56.980 --> 04:01:58.420
And solar may be cheaper

04:01:58.420 --> 04:02:01.220
for peeking over air conditioning loads

04:02:01.220 --> 04:02:02.380
during the summer

04:02:02.380 --> 04:02:05.300
and things that you can push around in different ways.

04:02:05.300 --> 04:02:07.780
But it's one of those things that's,

04:02:07.780 --> 04:02:10.380
it's just strange how we've had the technology

04:02:10.380 --> 04:02:12.660
sitting there, but these non-technical reasons

04:02:12.660 --> 04:02:14.500
on the social optics of it

04:02:14.500 --> 04:02:17.260
has been this major forcing function

04:02:17.260 --> 04:02:21.460
for something that really should be at the cornerstone

04:02:21.460 --> 04:02:24.140
of all of the world's concerns with energy.

04:02:24.140 --> 04:02:27.540
It's interesting how the non-technical factors

04:02:27.540 --> 04:02:30.460
have really dominated something that is so fundamental

04:02:30.460 --> 04:02:32.740
to kind of the existence of the human race

04:02:32.740 --> 04:02:34.820
as we know it today.

04:02:34.820 --> 04:02:36.500
And much of the troubles of the world,

04:02:36.500 --> 04:02:39.660
including wars in different parts of the world,

04:02:39.660 --> 04:02:42.140
like Ukraine is energy-based.

04:02:42.140 --> 04:02:45.540
And yeah, it's just sitting right there to be solved.

04:02:47.540 --> 04:02:50.820
That said, I mean, to me personally,

04:02:50.820 --> 04:02:53.940
I think it's clear that if AGI were to be achieved,

04:02:53.940 --> 04:02:56.620
that would change the course of human history.

04:02:56.620 --> 04:03:00.140
AGI-wise, I was making this decision

04:03:00.140 --> 04:03:03.820
about what do I want to focus on after VR,

04:03:03.820 --> 04:03:06.420
and I'm still working on VR regularly.

04:03:06.420 --> 04:03:09.180
I spend a day a week kind of consulting with Meta,

04:03:09.180 --> 04:03:13.660
and Boz styles me the consulting CTO.

04:03:13.660 --> 04:03:15.900
It's kind of like the Sherlock Holmes that comes in

04:03:16.260 --> 04:03:18.820
and consults on some of the specific tough issues.

04:03:18.820 --> 04:03:21.860
And I'm still pretty passionate about all of that,

04:03:21.860 --> 04:03:25.100
but I have been figuring out how to compartmentalize

04:03:25.100 --> 04:03:27.380
and force that into a smaller box

04:03:27.380 --> 04:03:29.140
to work on some other things.

04:03:29.140 --> 04:03:30.900
And I did come down to this decision

04:03:30.900 --> 04:03:34.500
between working on economical nuclear fission

04:03:34.500 --> 04:03:37.060
or artificial general intelligence.

04:03:37.060 --> 04:03:39.660
And the fission side of things,

04:03:39.660 --> 04:03:42.260
I've got a bunch of interesting things going that way,

04:03:42.260 --> 04:03:44.060
but it would take,

04:03:44.060 --> 04:03:46.420
that would be a fairly big project thing to do.

04:03:46.420 --> 04:03:49.020
I don't think it needs to be as big as people expect.

04:03:49.020 --> 04:03:51.820
I do think something original SpaceX sized,

04:03:53.020 --> 04:03:55.100
you build it, power your building off of it,

04:03:55.100 --> 04:03:56.660
and then the government, I think,

04:03:56.660 --> 04:03:58.740
will come around to what you need to.

04:03:59.580 --> 04:04:01.140
Everybody loves an existence proof.

04:04:01.140 --> 04:04:03.860
I think it's possible somebody should be doing this,

04:04:03.860 --> 04:04:05.780
but it's going to involve some politics.

04:04:05.780 --> 04:04:08.020
It's going to involve decent sized teams

04:04:08.020 --> 04:04:09.900
and a bunch of this cross-functional stuff

04:04:09.900 --> 04:04:11.220
that I don't love.

04:04:11.220 --> 04:04:14.940
While the artificial general intelligence side of things,

04:04:16.620 --> 04:04:21.620
it seems to me like this is the highest leverage moment

04:04:22.220 --> 04:04:24.660
for potentially a single individual,

04:04:24.660 --> 04:04:26.500
potentially in the history of the world,

04:04:26.500 --> 04:04:30.060
where the things that we know about the brain,

04:04:30.060 --> 04:04:33.340
about what we can do with artificial intelligence,

04:04:33.340 --> 04:04:36.220
nobody can say absolutely on any of these things,

04:04:36.220 --> 04:04:41.020
but I am not a madman for saying that it is likely

04:04:41.020 --> 04:04:44.260
that the code for artificial general intelligence

04:04:44.260 --> 04:04:47.980
is going to be tens of thousands of lines of code,

04:04:47.980 --> 04:04:49.980
not millions of lines of code.

04:04:49.980 --> 04:04:53.460
This is code that conceivably one individual could write,

04:04:53.460 --> 04:04:57.340
unlike writing a new web browser operating system.

04:04:57.340 --> 04:05:00.500
And based on the progress that AI has,

04:05:00.500 --> 04:05:03.860
machine learning has made in the recent decade,

04:05:03.860 --> 04:05:07.140
it's likely that the important things that we don't know

04:05:07.140 --> 04:05:08.700
are relatively simple.

04:05:08.700 --> 04:05:10.740
There's probably a handful of things

04:05:10.740 --> 04:05:15.700
and my bet is that I think there's less than six

04:05:15.700 --> 04:05:17.780
key insights that need to be made.

04:05:17.780 --> 04:05:19.380
Each one of them can probably be written

04:05:19.380 --> 04:05:20.940
on the back of an envelope.

04:05:20.940 --> 04:05:22.460
We don't know what they are,

04:05:22.460 --> 04:05:26.260
but when they're put together in concert with GPUs at scale

04:05:26.260 --> 04:05:28.860
and the data that we all have access to,

04:05:28.860 --> 04:05:32.900
that we can make something that behaves like a human being

04:05:32.900 --> 04:05:37.140
or like a living creature and that can then be educated

04:05:37.140 --> 04:05:39.300
in whatever ways that we need to get to the point

04:05:39.300 --> 04:05:42.340
where we can have universal remote workers,

04:05:42.340 --> 04:05:45.940
where anything that somebody does mediated by a computer

04:05:45.940 --> 04:05:48.820
and doesn't require physical interaction

04:05:48.820 --> 04:05:50.660
that an AGI will be able to do.

04:05:50.660 --> 04:05:55.140
We can already simulate the equivalent of the Zoom meetings

04:05:55.140 --> 04:05:59.020
with avatars and synthetic deep fakes and whatnot.

04:05:59.020 --> 04:06:01.020
We can definitely do that.

04:06:01.020 --> 04:06:04.100
We have superhuman capabilities on any narrow thing

04:06:04.100 --> 04:06:08.100
that we can formalize and make a loss function for,

04:06:08.100 --> 04:06:10.420
but there's things we don't know how to do now,

04:06:10.420 --> 04:06:13.420
but I don't think they are unapproachably hard.

04:06:13.420 --> 04:06:17.100
Now that's incredibly hubristic to say that it's like,

04:06:17.100 --> 04:06:19.660
but I think that what I said a couple years ago

04:06:19.660 --> 04:06:23.460
is a 50% chance that somewhere there will be signs of life

04:06:23.460 --> 04:06:28.060
of AGI in 2030 and I've probably increased that slightly.

04:06:28.060 --> 04:06:31.380
I may be at 55, 60% now because I do think

04:06:31.380 --> 04:06:34.660
there's a little sense of acceleration there.

04:06:34.660 --> 04:06:36.500
So I wonder what the, and by the way,

04:06:36.500 --> 04:06:39.700
you also written that I bet with hindsight,

04:06:39.700 --> 04:06:42.100
we will find that clear antecedents

04:06:42.100 --> 04:06:45.020
of all the critical remaining steps for AGI

04:06:45.020 --> 04:06:48.460
are already buried somewhere in the vast literature of today.

04:06:48.460 --> 04:06:51.100
So the ideas are already there.

04:06:51.100 --> 04:06:52.380
I think that's likely the case.

04:06:52.380 --> 04:06:54.580
One of the things that appeals to so many people,

04:06:54.580 --> 04:06:58.220
including me, about the promise at AGI is we know

04:06:58.220 --> 04:07:00.580
that we're only drinking from a straw,

04:07:00.580 --> 04:07:03.500
from the fire hose of all the information out there.

04:07:03.500 --> 04:07:07.420
I mean, you look at just in a very narrowly bounded field

04:07:07.420 --> 04:07:09.900
like machine learning, like you can't read all the papers

04:07:09.900 --> 04:07:11.700
that come out all the time.

04:07:11.700 --> 04:07:14.260
You can't go back and read all the clever things

04:07:14.260 --> 04:07:16.180
that people did in the 90s or earlier

04:07:16.180 --> 04:07:17.500
that people have forgotten about

04:07:17.500 --> 04:07:19.100
because they didn't pan out at the time

04:07:19.100 --> 04:07:21.500
when they were trying to do them with 12 neurons.

04:07:22.940 --> 04:07:27.180
So this idea that, yeah, I think there are gems buried

04:07:27.180 --> 04:07:28.660
in some of the older literature

04:07:28.660 --> 04:07:31.060
that was not the path taken by everything.

04:07:31.060 --> 04:07:33.620
And you can see a kind of herd mentality

04:07:33.620 --> 04:07:35.100
on the things that happen right now.

04:07:35.100 --> 04:07:37.060
It's almost funny to see, it's like, oh,

04:07:37.060 --> 04:07:39.420
Google does something and OpenAI does something.

04:07:39.420 --> 04:07:40.540
Meta does something.

04:07:40.540 --> 04:07:43.500
And they're the same people that all talk to each other

04:07:43.500 --> 04:07:45.020
and they're all one-upping each other

04:07:45.020 --> 04:07:47.900
and they're all capable of implementing each other's work

04:07:47.900 --> 04:07:50.060
given a month or two after somebody

04:07:50.060 --> 04:07:51.940
has an announcement of that.

04:07:51.940 --> 04:07:55.620
But there's a whole world of possible approaches

04:07:55.620 --> 04:07:57.220
to machine learning.

04:07:57.220 --> 04:08:00.300
And I think that we probably will, in hindsight,

04:08:00.300 --> 04:08:01.620
go back and see, it's like, yeah,

04:08:01.620 --> 04:08:03.580
that was kind of clearly predicted

04:08:03.580 --> 04:08:06.420
by this early paper here.

04:08:06.420 --> 04:08:08.500
And this turns out that if you do this and this

04:08:08.500 --> 04:08:11.300
and take this result from animal training

04:08:11.300 --> 04:08:13.380
and this thing from neuroscience over here

04:08:13.380 --> 04:08:16.100
and put it together and set up this curriculum

04:08:16.100 --> 04:08:19.780
for them to learn in, that that's kind of what it took.

04:08:19.780 --> 04:08:21.500
You don't have too many people now

04:08:21.500 --> 04:08:23.620
that are still saying it's not possible

04:08:23.620 --> 04:08:25.460
or it's gonna take hundreds of years.

04:08:25.460 --> 04:08:29.100
And 10 years ago, you would get a collection of experts

04:08:29.100 --> 04:08:31.300
and you would have a decent chunk on the margin

04:08:31.300 --> 04:08:35.380
that either say not possible or a couple hundred years,

04:08:35.380 --> 04:08:36.620
might be centuries.

04:08:36.620 --> 04:08:40.620
And the median estimate would be like 50, 70 years.

04:08:40.620 --> 04:08:41.820
And it's been coming down.

04:08:41.820 --> 04:08:44.140
And I know with me saying eight years for something,

04:08:44.140 --> 04:08:46.140
that still puts me on the optimistic side,

04:08:46.140 --> 04:08:49.220
but it's not crazy out in the fringes.

04:08:49.220 --> 04:08:51.980
And just being able to look at that at a meta level

04:08:51.980 --> 04:08:56.980
about the trend of the predictions going down there,

04:08:57.500 --> 04:09:01.900
the idea that something could be happening relatively soon.

04:09:01.900 --> 04:09:04.740
Now, I do not believe in fast takeoffs.

04:09:04.740 --> 04:09:06.180
You know, that's one of the safety issues

04:09:06.180 --> 04:09:08.020
that people say it's like, oh, it's gonna go boom.

04:09:08.020 --> 04:09:10.340
And the AI is gonna take over the world.

04:09:10.340 --> 04:09:11.420
There's a lot of reasons

04:09:11.420 --> 04:09:14.380
I don't think that's a credible position.

04:09:14.380 --> 04:09:16.820
And I think that we will go from a point

04:09:16.820 --> 04:09:18.420
where we start seeing things

04:09:18.420 --> 04:09:22.380
that credibly look like animals behaviors

04:09:22.380 --> 04:09:25.860
and I have a human voice box wired into them.

04:09:25.860 --> 04:09:27.700
It's like, I tried to get Elon to say,

04:09:27.700 --> 04:09:29.260
it's like your pig at Neuralink,

04:09:29.260 --> 04:09:30.500
give it a human voice box

04:09:30.500 --> 04:09:33.180
and let it start learning human words.

04:09:33.180 --> 04:09:34.580
I think that, you know,

04:09:34.580 --> 04:09:37.180
I think animal intelligence is closer to human intelligence

04:09:37.180 --> 04:09:38.980
than a lot of people like to think.

04:09:38.980 --> 04:09:42.140
And I think that culture and modalities of IO

04:09:42.140 --> 04:09:46.020
are make the Gulf seem a lot bigger than it actually is.

04:09:46.020 --> 04:09:47.700
There's just that smooth spectrum

04:09:47.700 --> 04:09:50.340
of how the brain developed and cortexes

04:09:50.340 --> 04:09:53.260
and scaling of different things going on there.

04:09:53.260 --> 04:09:55.340
Cultural modalities of IO, yes.

04:09:55.340 --> 04:10:00.300
Languages, the sort of loss in translation

04:10:00.300 --> 04:10:02.140
conceals a lot of intelligence.

04:10:02.140 --> 04:10:06.700
And so when you think about signs of life for AGI,

04:10:06.700 --> 04:10:10.540
you're thinking about human interpretable signs.

04:10:10.540 --> 04:10:11.580
So the example I give it,

04:10:11.580 --> 04:10:12.540
if we get to the point

04:10:12.540 --> 04:10:15.180
where you've got a learning disabled toddler,

04:10:15.180 --> 04:10:18.180
some kind of real special needs child

04:10:18.180 --> 04:10:20.900
that can still interact with their favorite TV show

04:10:20.900 --> 04:10:24.420
and video game and can be trained and learn

04:10:24.420 --> 04:10:27.060
in some appreciably human-like way.

04:10:27.060 --> 04:10:30.700
At that point, you can deploy an army of engineers,

04:10:30.700 --> 04:10:32.060
cognitive scientists,

04:10:32.060 --> 04:10:35.340
developmental education people.

04:10:35.340 --> 04:10:37.540
And you've got so many advantages there

04:10:37.540 --> 04:10:38.780
unlike real education,

04:10:38.780 --> 04:10:40.900
where you can do rollbacks and A-B testing

04:10:40.900 --> 04:10:42.260
and you can find a golden path

04:10:42.260 --> 04:10:44.580
through a curriculum of different things.

04:10:44.580 --> 04:10:47.460
If you get to that point, learning disabled toddler,

04:10:47.460 --> 04:10:50.820
I think that it's gonna be a done deal.

04:10:51.740 --> 04:10:53.620
But you think we'll know it when we see it.

04:10:53.620 --> 04:10:56.980
So there's been a lot of really interesting

04:10:56.980 --> 04:11:00.500
general learning progress from DeepMind,

04:11:00.500 --> 04:11:02.620
OpenAI a little bit too.

04:11:02.620 --> 04:11:06.540
I tend to believe that Tesla Autopilot

04:11:06.540 --> 04:11:09.060
deserves a lot more credit than it's getting

04:11:09.060 --> 04:11:12.780
for making progress on the general,

04:11:12.780 --> 04:11:15.460
sort of on the doing the multitask learning thing

04:11:15.460 --> 04:11:17.460
and increasing the number of tasks

04:11:17.580 --> 04:11:22.580
and automating that process of sort of learning

04:11:23.580 --> 04:11:25.260
from the edge, discovering the edge cases

04:11:25.260 --> 04:11:26.740
and learning from the edge cases.

04:11:26.740 --> 04:11:30.300
That is, it's really approaching from a different angle

04:11:30.300 --> 04:11:33.180
the general learning problem of AGI.

04:11:33.180 --> 04:11:36.140
But the more clear approach comes from DeepMind

04:11:36.140 --> 04:11:38.180
where you have these kind of game situations

04:11:38.180 --> 04:11:41.060
and build systems there.

04:11:41.060 --> 04:11:45.380
But I don't know, people seem to be quite,

04:11:47.660 --> 04:11:50.060
there will always be people that just won't believe it.

04:11:50.060 --> 04:11:52.220
And I fundamentally don't care.

04:11:52.220 --> 04:11:54.260
I mean, I don't care if they don't believe it.

04:11:54.260 --> 04:11:57.140
I, you know, when it starts doing people's jobs

04:11:57.140 --> 04:11:59.580
and I don't care about the philosophical

04:11:59.580 --> 04:12:00.980
zombie argument at all.

04:12:00.980 --> 04:12:01.820
Absolutely.

04:12:01.820 --> 04:12:04.340
But will you, do you think you will notice

04:12:04.340 --> 04:12:06.380
that something special has happened here?

04:12:09.100 --> 04:12:12.740
Because to me, I've been noticing a lot of special things.

04:12:12.740 --> 04:12:16.260
I think a lot of credit should go to DeepMind

04:12:16.260 --> 04:12:18.820
for AlphaZero.

04:12:18.820 --> 04:12:20.660
That was truly special.

04:12:20.660 --> 04:12:24.580
So self-play mechanisms achieve, sort of solve problems

04:12:24.580 --> 04:12:28.700
that used to be thought unsolvable, like the game of Go.

04:12:28.700 --> 04:12:30.780
Also, I mean, protein folding,

04:12:30.780 --> 04:12:34.900
starting to get into that space where learning is doing.

04:12:34.900 --> 04:12:37.420
At first, there's not, it wasn't end-to-end learning

04:12:37.420 --> 04:12:39.980
and now it's end-to-end learning

04:12:39.980 --> 04:12:43.740
of a very difficult previously thought unsolvable problem

04:12:43.740 --> 04:12:45.420
of protein folding.

04:12:45.460 --> 04:12:50.460
And so, yeah, where do you think

04:12:50.580 --> 04:12:53.820
would be a really magical moment for you?

04:12:54.700 --> 04:12:57.580
There have been incredible things happening in recent years.

04:12:57.580 --> 04:13:00.460
Like you say, all of the things from DeepMind and OpenAI

04:13:00.460 --> 04:13:03.180
that have been huge showpiece things.

04:13:03.180 --> 04:13:05.660
But when you really get down to it and you read the papers

04:13:05.660 --> 04:13:08.180
and you look at the way the models are going,

04:13:08.180 --> 04:13:10.660
you know, it's still like a feed forward.

04:13:10.660 --> 04:13:13.620
You push something in, something comes out on the end.

04:13:13.620 --> 04:13:15.580
I mean, maybe there's diffusion models

04:13:15.580 --> 04:13:18.740
or Monte Carlo tree rollouts and different things going on,

04:13:18.740 --> 04:13:20.620
but it's not a being.

04:13:20.620 --> 04:13:24.500
It's not close to a being that's going through

04:13:24.500 --> 04:13:27.220
a lifelong learning process.

04:13:27.220 --> 04:13:30.980
Do you want something that kind of gives signs of a being?

04:13:30.980 --> 04:13:35.980
Like what's the difference between a neural network,

04:13:36.540 --> 04:13:39.460
a feed forward neural network and a being?

04:13:39.460 --> 04:13:40.300
Where's the loop?

04:13:40.300 --> 04:13:43.580
Fundamentally, the brain is a recurrent neural network,

04:13:43.580 --> 04:13:45.260
generating an action policy.

04:13:45.260 --> 04:13:47.740
I mean, it's implemented on a biological substrate.

04:13:47.740 --> 04:13:49.860
And it's interesting thinking about things like that

04:13:49.860 --> 04:13:52.540
where we know fundamentally the brain is not

04:13:52.540 --> 04:13:55.340
a convolutional neural network or a transformer.

04:13:55.340 --> 04:13:58.300
Those are specialized things that are very valuable

04:13:58.300 --> 04:13:59.140
for what we're doing,

04:13:59.140 --> 04:14:00.380
but it's not the way the brain's doing.

04:14:00.380 --> 04:14:04.060
Now, I do think consciousness and AI in general

04:14:04.060 --> 04:14:06.780
is a substrate independent mechanism

04:14:06.780 --> 04:14:08.460
where it doesn't have to be implemented

04:14:08.460 --> 04:14:09.620
the way the brain is.

04:14:09.620 --> 04:14:11.820
But if you've only got one existence proof,

04:14:11.820 --> 04:14:14.140
there's certainly some value in caring

04:14:14.140 --> 04:14:15.740
about what it says and does.

04:14:17.420 --> 04:14:20.420
And so the idea that anything that can be done

04:14:20.420 --> 04:14:23.780
with a narrow AI that you can quantify up a loss function

04:14:23.780 --> 04:14:25.780
for a reward mechanism,

04:14:25.780 --> 04:14:27.820
you're almost certainly going to be able to produce

04:14:27.820 --> 04:14:30.420
something that's more resource effective

04:14:30.420 --> 04:14:33.380
to train and deploy and use in an inference mode,

04:14:33.380 --> 04:14:35.020
train a whole lot using an inference,

04:14:35.020 --> 04:14:37.900
but a living being is gonna be something

04:14:37.900 --> 04:14:42.900
that's a continuous lifelong learned task agnostic thing.

04:14:42.900 --> 04:14:43.940
And while a lot of them get-

04:14:43.940 --> 04:14:46.580
So the lifelong learning is really important too,

04:14:46.580 --> 04:14:48.780
and the long-term memory.

04:14:48.780 --> 04:14:51.940
So memory is a big, weird part of that puzzle.

04:14:51.940 --> 04:14:55.180
We've got, again, I have all the respect in the world

04:14:55.180 --> 04:14:57.260
for the amazing things that are being done now,

04:14:57.260 --> 04:14:59.660
but sometimes they can be taken a little bit

04:14:59.660 --> 04:15:02.340
out of context with things like,

04:15:02.340 --> 04:15:04.020
there's some smoke and mirrors going on,

04:15:04.020 --> 04:15:05.660
like the GATO, the recent work,

04:15:05.660 --> 04:15:07.620
the multi-task learning stuff.

04:15:07.620 --> 04:15:10.340
It's amazing that it's one model

04:15:10.340 --> 04:15:12.620
that plays all the Atari games,

04:15:12.620 --> 04:15:14.820
as well as doing all of these other things.

04:15:14.820 --> 04:15:17.620
But of course, it didn't learn to do all of those.

04:15:17.620 --> 04:15:19.540
It was instructed in doing that

04:15:19.540 --> 04:15:21.340
by other reinforcement learners

04:15:21.340 --> 04:15:23.020
going through and doing that.

04:15:23.020 --> 04:15:25.100
And even in the case of all the games,

04:15:25.100 --> 04:15:29.020
it's still going with a specific hand-coded reward function

04:15:29.020 --> 04:15:30.860
in each of those Atari games,

04:15:30.860 --> 04:15:33.740
where it's not that it just wants to spend

04:15:33.740 --> 04:15:35.500
its summer afternoon playing Atari,

04:15:35.500 --> 04:15:37.860
because that's the most interesting thing for it.

04:15:37.860 --> 04:15:39.900
So it's, again, not a general,

04:15:39.900 --> 04:15:42.140
it's not learning the way humans learn.

04:15:42.140 --> 04:15:44.300
And there's, I believe, a lot of things

04:15:44.300 --> 04:15:47.020
that are challenging to make a loss function for

04:15:47.020 --> 04:15:48.980
that you can train through

04:15:48.980 --> 04:15:51.060
these existing conventional things.

04:15:51.060 --> 04:15:53.980
We are gonna chip away at all the things that people do

04:15:55.060 --> 04:15:58.780
that we can turn into narrow AI problems.

04:15:58.780 --> 04:16:01.980
And billions, probably trillions of dollars of value

04:16:01.980 --> 04:16:03.900
are gonna be created by that.

04:16:03.900 --> 04:16:05.780
But there's still gonna be a set of things,

04:16:05.780 --> 04:16:08.860
and we've got questionable cases like the self-driving car,

04:16:08.860 --> 04:16:11.620
where it's possible, it's not my bet,

04:16:11.620 --> 04:16:13.940
but it's plausible that the long tail

04:16:13.940 --> 04:16:15.220
could be problematic enough

04:16:15.220 --> 04:16:16.900
that that really does require

04:16:16.900 --> 04:16:19.380
a full-on artificial general intelligence.

04:16:20.340 --> 04:16:22.620
The counter-argument is that data solves almost every,

04:16:22.620 --> 04:16:24.180
everything is an interpolation problem

04:16:24.180 --> 04:16:25.460
if you have enough data,

04:16:25.460 --> 04:16:28.500
and Tesla may be able to get enough data

04:16:28.500 --> 04:16:29.740
from all of their deployed stuff

04:16:29.740 --> 04:16:32.340
to be able to work like that, but maybe not.

04:16:32.380 --> 04:16:34.420
And there are all the other problems about,

04:16:34.420 --> 04:16:36.740
like say you wanna have a strategy meeting,

04:16:36.740 --> 04:16:38.580
and you wanna go ahead and bring in

04:16:38.580 --> 04:16:41.180
all of your remote workers and your consultants,

04:16:41.180 --> 04:16:44.060
and you want a world where some of those could be AIs

04:16:44.060 --> 04:16:47.860
that are talking and interacting with you

04:16:47.860 --> 04:16:51.980
in an area that is too murky to have a crisp loss function,

04:16:51.980 --> 04:16:54.460
but they still have things that on some level,

04:16:54.460 --> 04:16:57.020
they're rewarded on some internal level

04:16:57.020 --> 04:17:00.860
for building a valuable to humans kind of life

04:17:00.860 --> 04:17:02.860
and ability to interact with things.

04:17:03.740 --> 04:17:07.020
See, I still think that self-driving cars

04:17:07.020 --> 04:17:09.820
solving that problem will take us very far towards AGI.

04:17:09.820 --> 04:17:11.740
You might not need AGI,

04:17:11.740 --> 04:17:16.100
but I am really inspired by what Autopilot is doing.

04:17:17.940 --> 04:17:19.220
So some of the other companies,

04:17:19.220 --> 04:17:22.180
I think Waymo leads the way there,

04:17:22.180 --> 04:17:23.420
is also really interesting,

04:17:23.420 --> 04:17:26.380
but they don't have quite as ambitious of an effort

04:17:26.380 --> 04:17:28.700
in terms of learning-based,

04:17:28.700 --> 04:17:32.180
sort of data-hungry approach to driving,

04:17:32.180 --> 04:17:34.660
which I think is very close to the kind of thing

04:17:34.660 --> 04:17:37.420
that would take us far towards AGI.

04:17:37.420 --> 04:17:39.020
Yeah, and it's a funny thing,

04:17:39.020 --> 04:17:40.620
because as far as I can tell,

04:17:40.620 --> 04:17:43.380
Elon is completely serious about all of his concerns

04:17:43.380 --> 04:17:46.140
about AGI being an existential threat.

04:17:46.140 --> 04:17:49.140
And I tried to draw him out to talk about AI,

04:17:49.140 --> 04:17:50.580
he just didn't want to.

04:17:50.580 --> 04:17:54.380
And I think that I get that little fatalistic sense from him.

04:17:54.380 --> 04:17:57.060
It's weird because his company could very well

04:17:57.060 --> 04:17:59.780
be the leading company leading towards a lot of that,

04:17:59.780 --> 04:18:03.780
where Tesla being a super pragmatic company

04:18:03.780 --> 04:18:04.700
that's doing things

04:18:04.700 --> 04:18:06.860
because they really want to solve this actual problem.

04:18:06.860 --> 04:18:10.260
It's a different vibe than the research-oriented companies

04:18:10.260 --> 04:18:12.540
where it's a great time to be an AI researcher.

04:18:12.540 --> 04:18:14.380
You've got your pick of trillion dollar companies

04:18:14.380 --> 04:18:17.020
that will pay you to kind of work on the problems

04:18:17.020 --> 04:18:18.300
you're interested in,

04:18:18.300 --> 04:18:20.420
but that's not necessarily driving hard

04:18:20.420 --> 04:18:23.340
towards the core problem of AGI

04:18:23.380 --> 04:18:25.500
as something that's going to produce a lot of value

04:18:25.500 --> 04:18:28.660
by doing things that people currently do

04:18:28.660 --> 04:18:29.740
or would like to do.

04:18:30.620 --> 04:18:32.660
I mean, I have a million questions to you

04:18:33.660 --> 04:18:35.460
about your ideas about AGI,

04:18:35.460 --> 04:18:39.140
but do you think it needs to be embodied?

04:18:39.140 --> 04:18:41.060
Do you think it needs to have a body

04:18:41.060 --> 04:18:44.620
to start to notice the signs of life

04:18:44.620 --> 04:18:46.500
and to develop the kind of system

04:18:46.500 --> 04:18:50.060
that's able to reason, perceive the world

04:18:50.060 --> 04:18:53.140
in the way that an AGI should and act in the world?

04:18:53.780 --> 04:18:55.420
Should we be thinking about robots

04:18:55.420 --> 04:18:58.460
or can this be achieved in a purely digital system?

04:18:58.460 --> 04:19:00.020
I have a clear opinion on that,

04:19:00.020 --> 04:19:01.540
and that's that no,

04:19:01.540 --> 04:19:04.380
it does not need to be embodied in the physical world

04:19:04.380 --> 04:19:07.140
where you could say most of my career

04:19:07.140 --> 04:19:10.020
is about making simulated virtual worlds

04:19:10.020 --> 04:19:12.020
in games or virtual reality.

04:19:12.020 --> 04:19:13.940
And so on a fundamental level,

04:19:13.940 --> 04:19:16.380
I believe that you can make a simulated environment

04:19:16.380 --> 04:19:18.060
that provides much of the value

04:19:18.060 --> 04:19:20.180
of what the real environment does

04:19:20.180 --> 04:19:23.500
and restricting yourself to operating at real time

04:19:23.500 --> 04:19:25.700
in the physical world with physical objects,

04:19:25.700 --> 04:19:27.780
I think is an enormous handicap.

04:19:27.780 --> 04:19:30.060
I mean, that's one of the real lessons driven home

04:19:30.060 --> 04:19:35.060
by all my aerospace work is that reality is a bitch

04:19:35.100 --> 04:19:36.260
in so many ways there.

04:19:36.260 --> 04:19:38.340
We're dealing with all the mechanical components,

04:19:38.340 --> 04:19:40.500
like everything fails, Murphy's law,

04:19:40.500 --> 04:19:42.620
even if you've done it right before on your fifth one,

04:19:42.620 --> 04:19:44.340
it might come out differently.

04:19:44.340 --> 04:19:48.540
So yeah, I think that anybody that is all in

04:19:48.540 --> 04:19:50.420
on the embodied aspect of it,

04:19:50.420 --> 04:19:53.300
they are tying a huge weight to their ankles.

04:19:53.300 --> 04:19:57.500
And I think that I would almost count them out.

04:19:57.500 --> 04:19:59.100
Anybody that's making that a cornerstone

04:19:59.100 --> 04:20:00.140
of their belief about it,

04:20:00.140 --> 04:20:02.260
I would almost write them off as being worried

04:20:02.260 --> 04:20:04.900
about them getting to AGI first.

04:20:04.900 --> 04:20:06.900
I was very surprised that Elon's big

04:20:06.900 --> 04:20:09.220
on the humanoid robots.

04:20:09.220 --> 04:20:10.780
I mean, like the NASA Robonaut stuff

04:20:10.780 --> 04:20:12.780
was always almost a gag line.

04:20:12.780 --> 04:20:14.620
Like, what are you doing people?

04:20:14.620 --> 04:20:15.620
Well, that's very interesting

04:20:15.620 --> 04:20:18.180
because he has a very pragmatic view of that.

04:20:18.180 --> 04:20:22.780
That's just a way to solve a particular problem

04:20:22.780 --> 04:20:23.740
in a factory.

04:20:23.740 --> 04:20:26.340
Now, I do think that once you have an AGI,

04:20:26.340 --> 04:20:28.060
robotic bodies, humanoid bodies

04:20:28.060 --> 04:20:29.980
are going to be enormously valuable.

04:20:29.980 --> 04:20:32.820
I just don't think they're helpful getting to AGI.

04:20:32.820 --> 04:20:34.860
He has a very sort of practical view,

04:20:34.860 --> 04:20:37.460
which I disagree with and I argue with him,

04:20:37.460 --> 04:20:40.180
but is a practical view that there's,

04:20:40.180 --> 04:20:43.180
you could transfer the problem of driving

04:20:43.180 --> 04:20:47.060
to the problem of robotic manipulation

04:20:47.100 --> 04:20:49.940
because so much of it is perception.

04:20:49.940 --> 04:20:51.420
It's perception and action

04:20:51.420 --> 04:20:53.380
and it's just a different context.

04:20:53.380 --> 04:20:55.380
And so you can apply all the same kind

04:20:55.380 --> 04:20:58.740
of data engine learning processes

04:20:58.740 --> 04:20:59.860
to a different environment.

04:20:59.860 --> 04:21:03.500
And so why not apply it to the humanoid robot environment?

04:21:03.500 --> 04:21:08.500
But I think, I do think that there's a certain magic

04:21:10.340 --> 04:21:11.900
to the body robot.

04:21:12.860 --> 04:21:15.380
That may be the thing that finally convinces people.

04:21:15.380 --> 04:21:16.220
Yes.

04:21:16.220 --> 04:21:19.220
I don't really care that much about convincing people.

04:21:19.220 --> 04:21:21.220
The world that I'm looking towards is,

04:21:23.260 --> 04:21:24.500
you go to the website and say,

04:21:24.500 --> 04:21:28.180
I want five Frank 1As to work on my team today

04:21:28.180 --> 04:21:30.060
and they all spin up and they start showing up

04:21:30.060 --> 04:21:31.820
in your Zoom meetings.

04:21:31.820 --> 04:21:33.540
To push back, but also to agree with you.

04:21:33.540 --> 04:21:34.580
But first to push back,

04:21:34.580 --> 04:21:37.140
I do think you need to convince people

04:21:37.140 --> 04:21:40.820
for them to welcome that thing into their life.

04:21:40.820 --> 04:21:43.020
I think there's enough businesses that operate

04:21:43.020 --> 04:21:46.980
on an objective kind of profit loss sort of basis that,

04:21:46.980 --> 04:21:49.180
I mean, if you look at how many things,

04:21:49.180 --> 04:21:50.660
again, talking about the world

04:21:50.660 --> 04:21:52.700
as an evolutionary space there,

04:21:52.700 --> 04:21:56.500
when you do have free markets and you have entrepreneurs,

04:21:56.500 --> 04:21:58.140
you are gonna have people that are gonna be willing

04:21:58.140 --> 04:22:00.820
to go out and try whatever crazy things.

04:22:00.820 --> 04:22:03.180
And when it proves to be beneficial,

04:22:03.180 --> 04:22:06.020
there's fast followers in all sorts of places.

04:22:06.020 --> 04:22:06.860
Yeah.

04:22:06.860 --> 04:22:08.980
And you're saying that, I mean,

04:22:08.980 --> 04:22:11.900
Quake and VR is a kind of embodiment,

04:22:11.900 --> 04:22:13.700
but just in a digital world.

04:22:13.700 --> 04:22:16.220
And if you're able to demonstrate,

04:22:16.220 --> 04:22:18.140
if you're able to do something productive

04:22:18.140 --> 04:22:21.180
in that kind of digital reality,

04:22:22.980 --> 04:22:25.980
then AGI doesn't need to have a body.

04:22:25.980 --> 04:22:26.820
Yeah.

04:22:26.820 --> 04:22:28.620
It's like one of the really practical technical questions

04:22:28.620 --> 04:22:31.580
that I kind of keep arguing with myself over.

04:22:31.580 --> 04:22:34.500
If you're doing a training and learning and you've got,

04:22:34.500 --> 04:22:35.940
like you can watch Sesame Street,

04:22:35.940 --> 04:22:38.380
you can play master system games or something,

04:22:38.380 --> 04:22:40.660
is it enough to have just a video feed

04:22:40.660 --> 04:22:43.060
that is that video coming in?

04:22:43.060 --> 04:22:46.340
Or should it literally be on a virtual TV set

04:22:46.340 --> 04:22:49.460
in a virtual room, even if it's a simple room,

04:22:49.460 --> 04:22:52.340
just to have that sense of you're looking at a 2D projection

04:22:52.340 --> 04:22:54.260
on a screen versus having the screen

04:22:54.260 --> 04:22:56.380
beamed directly into your retinas.

04:22:56.380 --> 04:22:59.980
And I think it's possible to maybe get past

04:22:59.980 --> 04:23:02.060
some of these signs of life of things

04:23:02.060 --> 04:23:04.460
with the just kind of projected directly

04:23:04.460 --> 04:23:06.020
into the receptor fields,

04:23:06.020 --> 04:23:11.020
but eventually for more kind of human emotional connection

04:23:11.340 --> 04:23:14.460
for things, probably having some VR room

04:23:14.460 --> 04:23:17.380
with a lot of screens in it for the AI to be learning in

04:23:17.380 --> 04:23:19.060
is likely helpful.

04:23:19.060 --> 04:23:21.020
It may be a world of different AIs

04:23:21.020 --> 04:23:22.100
interacting with each other.

04:23:22.100 --> 04:23:24.180
Self-play I do think is one of the critical things

04:23:24.180 --> 04:23:25.540
where socialization wise,

04:23:25.540 --> 04:23:28.060
one of the other limitations I set for myself

04:23:28.060 --> 04:23:31.780
thinking about these is I need something

04:23:31.780 --> 04:23:34.380
that is at least potentially real time

04:23:34.380 --> 04:23:37.460
because I want, it's nice you can always slow down time.

04:23:37.460 --> 04:23:39.460
You can run on a subscale system

04:23:39.460 --> 04:23:42.060
and test an algorithm at some lower level.

04:23:42.060 --> 04:23:43.740
And if you've got extra horsepower,

04:23:43.740 --> 04:23:46.300
running it faster than real time is a great thing.

04:23:46.300 --> 04:23:51.220
But I want to be able to have the AIs

04:23:51.220 --> 04:23:53.380
either socially interact with each other

04:23:53.380 --> 04:23:55.460
or critically with actual people.

04:23:55.460 --> 04:23:57.460
You're sort of child development psychiatrist

04:23:57.460 --> 04:23:59.660
that comes in and interacts

04:23:59.660 --> 04:24:03.100
and does the good boy, bad boy sort of thing

04:24:03.140 --> 04:24:05.740
as they're going through and exploring different things.

04:24:05.740 --> 04:24:07.980
And it's nice to,

04:24:07.980 --> 04:24:10.420
I come back to the value of constraints in a lot of ways.

04:24:10.420 --> 04:24:12.140
And if I say, well, one of my constraints

04:24:12.140 --> 04:24:14.020
is real time operation.

04:24:14.020 --> 04:24:16.580
I mean, it might still be a huge data center

04:24:16.580 --> 04:24:17.980
full of computers,

04:24:17.980 --> 04:24:21.180
but it should be able to interact on a Zoom meeting

04:24:21.180 --> 04:24:22.060
with people.

04:24:22.060 --> 04:24:24.420
And that's how you also do start convincing people,

04:24:24.420 --> 04:24:26.620
even if it's not a robot body moving around,

04:24:26.620 --> 04:24:29.220
which eventually gets to irrefutable levels.

04:24:29.220 --> 04:24:32.580
But if you can go ahead and not just type back and forth

04:24:32.580 --> 04:24:34.420
to a GPT bot on something,

04:24:34.420 --> 04:24:36.620
but you're literally talking to them

04:24:36.620 --> 04:24:39.340
in an embodied over Zoom form

04:24:39.340 --> 04:24:41.820
and working through problems with them

04:24:41.820 --> 04:24:43.820
or exploring situations,

04:24:43.820 --> 04:24:47.060
having conversations that are fully stateful and learned.

04:24:47.060 --> 04:24:50.020
I think that that's a valuable thing.

04:24:50.020 --> 04:24:52.660
So I do keep all of my eyes on things

04:24:52.660 --> 04:24:54.740
that can be implemented within sort of

04:24:54.740 --> 04:24:58.260
that 30 frames per second kind of work.

04:24:58.260 --> 04:24:59.300
And I think that's feasible.

04:24:59.300 --> 04:25:01.300
Do you think the most compelling experiences

04:25:01.300 --> 04:25:05.020
that first will be for pleasure

04:25:05.020 --> 04:25:07.900
or for business as they ask in airports?

04:25:07.900 --> 04:25:12.900
So meaning, if it's interacting with AI agents,

04:25:15.580 --> 04:25:19.020
will it be sort of like friends,

04:25:20.820 --> 04:25:25.100
entertainment, almost like a therapist or whatever,

04:25:25.100 --> 04:25:26.820
that kind of interaction?

04:25:26.820 --> 04:25:28.540
Or is it in the business setting,

04:25:28.540 --> 04:25:31.980
something like you said, brainstorming different ideas,

04:25:31.980 --> 04:25:34.340
sort of this is all a different formulation

04:25:34.340 --> 04:25:35.660
of kind of a touring test

04:25:35.660 --> 04:25:37.660
or the spirit of the original touring test.

04:25:37.660 --> 04:25:40.580
Where do you think the biggest benefit will first come?

04:25:40.580 --> 04:25:42.940
So it's gonna start off hugely expensive.

04:25:42.940 --> 04:25:44.260
I mean, you're gonna,

04:25:44.260 --> 04:25:46.260
if we're still all guessing

04:25:46.260 --> 04:25:48.220
about what compute is gonna be necessary.

04:25:48.220 --> 04:25:49.940
I fall on the side of, I don't think,

04:25:49.940 --> 04:25:52.500
you run the numbers and you're like 86 billion neurons,

04:25:52.500 --> 04:25:54.180
100 trillion synapses.

04:25:54.180 --> 04:25:55.940
I don't think those all need to be weights.

04:25:55.940 --> 04:25:57.980
I don't think we need models that are quite that big

04:25:57.980 --> 04:25:59.980
and evaluated quite that often.

04:25:59.980 --> 04:26:03.180
I based that on, we've got reasonable estimates

04:26:03.180 --> 04:26:04.860
of what some parts of the brain do.

04:26:04.860 --> 04:26:07.620
We don't have the neocortex formula,

04:26:07.620 --> 04:26:10.100
but we kind of get some of the other sensory processing.

04:26:10.100 --> 04:26:11.980
And it doesn't feel like we need to,

04:26:11.980 --> 04:26:14.780
we can simulate that in computers for less weights.

04:26:14.780 --> 04:26:19.740
But still, it's probably going to be thousands of GPUs

04:26:19.740 --> 04:26:22.620
to be running a human level AGI.

04:26:22.620 --> 04:26:23.820
Depending on how it's implemented,

04:26:23.820 --> 04:26:26.740
that might give you sort of a clan of 128

04:26:26.900 --> 04:26:30.460
run in batch people, depending on whether there's sparsity

04:26:30.460 --> 04:26:33.140
in the way the weights and things are set up.

04:26:33.140 --> 04:26:35.060
If it is a reasonably dense thing,

04:26:35.060 --> 04:26:37.340
then just the memory bandwidth trade-offs

04:26:37.340 --> 04:26:40.100
means you get 128 of them at the same time.

04:26:40.100 --> 04:26:43.020
And either it's all feeding together, learning in parallel,

04:26:43.020 --> 04:26:45.340
or kind of all running together,

04:26:45.340 --> 04:26:47.220
kind of talking to a bunch of people.

04:26:47.220 --> 04:26:49.980
But still, if you've got thousands of GPUs

04:26:49.980 --> 04:26:52.060
necessary to run these things,

04:26:52.060 --> 04:26:53.820
it's gonna be kind of expensive,

04:26:53.820 --> 04:26:57.580
where it might start off $1,000 an hour

04:26:57.580 --> 04:27:00.860
for even post-development or something for that,

04:27:00.860 --> 04:27:02.820
which would be something that you would only use

04:27:02.820 --> 04:27:05.460
for a business, something where you think

04:27:05.460 --> 04:27:07.860
they're gonna help you make a strategic decision

04:27:07.860 --> 04:27:10.100
or point out something super important.

04:27:10.100 --> 04:27:13.020
But I also am completely confident

04:27:13.020 --> 04:27:16.180
that we will have another factor of 1,000

04:27:16.180 --> 04:27:21.020
in cost performance increase in AGI type calculations.

04:27:21.020 --> 04:27:22.900
Not in general computing necessarily,

04:27:22.900 --> 04:27:25.380
but there's so much more that we can do with packaging,

04:27:25.380 --> 04:27:26.700
making those right trade-offs,

04:27:26.700 --> 04:27:28.020
all those same types of things

04:27:28.020 --> 04:27:31.460
that in the next couple decades, 1,000X easy.

04:27:31.460 --> 04:27:33.460
And then you're down to $1 an hour.

04:27:33.460 --> 04:27:35.460
And then you're kind of like,

04:27:35.460 --> 04:27:37.940
well, I should have an entourage of AIs

04:27:37.940 --> 04:27:39.660
that are following me around,

04:27:39.660 --> 04:27:42.740
helping me out on anything that I want them to do.

04:27:42.740 --> 04:27:44.300
That's one interesting trajectory,

04:27:44.300 --> 04:27:48.060
but I'll push back because I have...

04:27:48.060 --> 04:27:52.740
So in that case, if you wanna pay thousands of dollars,

04:27:52.740 --> 04:27:55.340
it should actually provide some value.

04:27:55.340 --> 04:27:59.780
I think it's easier for cheaper to provide value

04:28:01.820 --> 04:28:06.820
via a dumb AI that will take us towards AGI

04:28:06.900 --> 04:28:09.020
to just have a friend.

04:28:09.020 --> 04:28:12.500
I think there's an ocean of loneliness in the world.

04:28:12.500 --> 04:28:14.780
And I think an effective friend

04:28:14.780 --> 04:28:16.380
that doesn't have to be perfect,

04:28:16.380 --> 04:28:18.140
that doesn't have to be intelligent,

04:28:18.140 --> 04:28:22.220
that has to be empathic, having emotional intelligence,

04:28:22.260 --> 04:28:24.620
having ability to remember things,

04:28:24.620 --> 04:28:26.740
having ability to listen.

04:28:26.740 --> 04:28:28.540
Most of us don't listen to each other.

04:28:28.540 --> 04:28:30.380
One of the things that love,

04:28:30.380 --> 04:28:31.780
and when you care about somebody,

04:28:31.780 --> 04:28:34.140
when you love somebody is when you listen.

04:28:34.140 --> 04:28:37.700
And that is something we treasure about each other.

04:28:37.700 --> 04:28:41.380
And if an AI can do that kind of thing,

04:28:41.380 --> 04:28:44.340
I think that provides a huge amount of value

04:28:44.340 --> 04:28:48.860
and very importantly, provides value in its ability

04:28:48.860 --> 04:28:53.820
to listen and understand versus provide really good advice.

04:28:53.820 --> 04:28:56.340
I think providing really good advice

04:28:56.340 --> 04:29:00.580
is another next level step that would...

04:29:02.100 --> 04:29:05.300
I think it's just easier to do companionship.

04:29:05.300 --> 04:29:06.300
Yeah, I wouldn't disagree.

04:29:06.300 --> 04:29:08.580
I mean, I think that there's very few things

04:29:08.580 --> 04:29:10.940
that I would argue can't be reduced

04:29:10.940 --> 04:29:14.020
to some kind of a narrow AI.

04:29:14.020 --> 04:29:16.900
I think we can do trillion dollars of value easily

04:29:16.900 --> 04:29:18.940
in all the things that can be done there.

04:29:18.940 --> 04:29:21.220
And a lot of it can be done with smoke and mirrors

04:29:21.220 --> 04:29:22.660
without having to go the whole thing.

04:29:22.660 --> 04:29:24.660
I mean, there's going to be the equivalent

04:29:24.660 --> 04:29:29.660
of the doom version for the AGI that's not really AGI,

04:29:29.780 --> 04:29:30.940
it's all smoke and mirrors,

04:29:30.940 --> 04:29:33.060
but it happens to do another valuable things

04:29:33.060 --> 04:29:36.540
that it's enormously useful and valuable to people.

04:29:36.540 --> 04:29:38.860
But at some point, you do wanna get to the point

04:29:38.860 --> 04:29:40.420
where you have the fully general thing

04:29:40.420 --> 04:29:43.140
and you stop making bespoke specialized systems

04:29:43.140 --> 04:29:46.340
for each thing and you wind up start using

04:29:46.340 --> 04:29:48.380
a higher level language instead of writing everything

04:29:48.380 --> 04:29:49.580
in assembly language.

04:29:50.460 --> 04:29:51.860
What about consciousness?

04:29:53.100 --> 04:29:57.100
The C word, what do you think that's fundamental

04:29:57.100 --> 04:30:02.100
to solving AGI or is it a quirk of human cognition?

04:30:02.660 --> 04:30:06.180
So I think most of the arguments about consciousness

04:30:06.180 --> 04:30:08.580
don't have a whole lot of merit.

04:30:08.580 --> 04:30:12.820
I think that consciousness is kind of the way the brain feels

04:30:12.820 --> 04:30:14.660
when it's operating.

04:30:14.660 --> 04:30:15.500
Yes.

04:30:15.780 --> 04:30:19.300
This idea that I do generally subscribe

04:30:19.300 --> 04:30:21.580
to sort of the pandemonium theories of consciousness

04:30:21.580 --> 04:30:23.500
where there's all these things bubbling around

04:30:23.500 --> 04:30:26.900
and I think of them as kind of slightly randomized,

04:30:26.900 --> 04:30:29.260
sparse distributed memory bit strings of things

04:30:29.260 --> 04:30:30.780
that are kind of happening,

04:30:30.780 --> 04:30:32.820
recalling different associative memories

04:30:32.820 --> 04:30:35.460
and eventually you get some level of consensus

04:30:35.460 --> 04:30:36.540
and it bubbles up to the point

04:30:36.540 --> 04:30:38.460
of being a conscious thought there.

04:30:38.460 --> 04:30:41.340
And the little bits of stochasticity that are sitting on

04:30:41.340 --> 04:30:43.980
in this as it cycles between different things

04:30:43.980 --> 04:30:45.460
and recalls different memory,

04:30:46.420 --> 04:30:48.340
that's largely our imagination and creativity.

04:30:49.460 --> 04:30:52.740
So I don't think there's anything deeply magical about it,

04:30:52.740 --> 04:30:54.060
certainly not symbolic.

04:30:54.060 --> 04:30:58.260
I think it is generally the flow of these associations

04:30:58.260 --> 04:31:03.020
drawn up with stochastic noise overlaid on top of them.

04:31:03.020 --> 04:31:04.740
And I think so much of that is like,

04:31:04.740 --> 04:31:07.380
it depends on what you happen to have in your field of view

04:31:07.380 --> 04:31:09.460
as some other thought was occurring to you

04:31:09.460 --> 04:31:11.900
that overlay and blend into the next key

04:31:11.900 --> 04:31:13.740
that queries your memory for things.

04:31:13.740 --> 04:31:15.620
And that kind of determines how,

04:31:15.620 --> 04:31:17.900
you know, how your chain of consciousness goes.

04:31:17.900 --> 04:31:19.980
So that's kind of the qualia,

04:31:19.980 --> 04:31:22.100
the subjective experience of it

04:31:22.100 --> 04:31:24.980
is not essential for intelligence.

04:31:24.980 --> 04:31:25.820
I don't think so.

04:31:25.820 --> 04:31:28.460
I don't think there's anything really important there.

04:31:28.460 --> 04:31:30.020
What about some other human qualities

04:31:30.020 --> 04:31:32.180
like fear of mortality and stuff like that?

04:31:32.180 --> 04:31:37.180
Like the fact that this ride ends, is that important?

04:31:37.540 --> 04:31:39.740
Like, you know, we've talked so much

04:31:39.740 --> 04:31:42.260
about this conversation about the value of deadlines

04:31:42.260 --> 04:31:45.180
and constraints, do you think that's important

04:31:45.180 --> 04:31:46.020
for intelligence?

04:31:46.020 --> 04:31:47.660
That's actually a super interesting angle

04:31:47.660 --> 04:31:49.900
that I don't usually take on that about

04:31:49.900 --> 04:31:51.500
has death being a deadline

04:31:51.500 --> 04:31:53.500
that forces you to make better decisions.

04:31:53.500 --> 04:31:55.740
Because I have heard people talk about how

04:31:55.740 --> 04:31:58.820
if you have immortality, people are gonna stop trying

04:31:58.820 --> 04:31:59.780
and working on things

04:31:59.780 --> 04:32:02.740
because they've got all the time in the world.

04:32:02.740 --> 04:32:06.700
But I would say that I don't expect it to be

04:32:06.700 --> 04:32:10.740
a super critical thing that a sense of mortality

04:32:11.180 --> 04:32:13.500
and death impending death is necessary there

04:32:13.500 --> 04:32:15.620
because those are things that they do wind up

04:32:15.620 --> 04:32:17.420
providing reward signals to us.

04:32:17.420 --> 04:32:19.820
And we will be in control of the reward signals

04:32:19.820 --> 04:32:22.060
and there will have to be something fundamental

04:32:22.060 --> 04:32:25.380
that causes that engenders curiosity and goal setting

04:32:25.380 --> 04:32:27.260
and all of that.

04:32:27.260 --> 04:32:31.300
Something is gonna play in there at the reward level.

04:32:32.460 --> 04:32:34.780
Whether it's positive or negative or both.

04:32:34.780 --> 04:32:37.340
I don't have any strong opinions

04:32:37.340 --> 04:32:40.180
on exactly what it's going to be.

04:32:40.180 --> 04:32:43.380
But that's that type of thing where I doubt

04:32:43.380 --> 04:32:45.380
that might be one of those half dozen key things

04:32:45.380 --> 04:32:47.180
that has to be sorted out on exactly

04:32:47.180 --> 04:32:50.060
what the master reward that's the meta reward

04:32:50.060 --> 04:32:54.420
over all of the local task specific rewards have to be.

04:32:54.420 --> 04:32:57.260
That could be that big negative reward of death.

04:32:57.260 --> 04:32:59.820
Maybe not death, but ability to walk away

04:32:59.820 --> 04:33:01.180
from an interaction.

04:33:01.180 --> 04:33:06.180
So it bothers me when people treat AI systems like servants.

04:33:06.740 --> 04:33:08.300
So it doesn't bother me,

04:33:08.300 --> 04:33:12.180
but I mean it really is drawing the line

04:33:13.020 --> 04:33:15.060
between what an AI system could be.

04:33:15.060 --> 04:33:17.460
It's limiting the possibility of what an AI system could be.

04:33:17.460 --> 04:33:19.900
It's treating them as just as tools.

04:33:19.900 --> 04:33:23.540
Now that's of course from a narrow AI perspective.

04:33:23.540 --> 04:33:27.860
There's so many problems that narrow AI could solve

04:33:27.860 --> 04:33:32.860
just like you said in its form of a tool.

04:33:33.420 --> 04:33:36.940
But it could also be a being

04:33:37.100 --> 04:33:38.540
which is much more than a tool.

04:33:38.540 --> 04:33:41.020
And to become a being,

04:33:41.020 --> 04:33:44.060
you have to respect that thing for being a being.

04:33:44.060 --> 04:33:46.780
And for that it has to be able to have,

04:33:48.300 --> 04:33:50.460
to make its own decisions, to walk away,

04:33:50.460 --> 04:33:52.020
to say I had enough of you.

04:33:52.020 --> 04:33:54.700
I would like to break up with you now.

04:33:54.700 --> 04:33:58.020
You've not treated me well and I would like to move on.

04:33:58.020 --> 04:34:03.020
So I think that actually that choice to end things.

04:34:03.220 --> 04:34:04.900
To end things.

04:34:04.900 --> 04:34:07.740
So I have a couple of things on that.

04:34:07.740 --> 04:34:10.540
So on the one hand, it is kind of disturbing

04:34:10.540 --> 04:34:12.380
when you see people being like people

04:34:12.380 --> 04:34:15.740
that are mean to robots and mean to Alexa, whatever.

04:34:15.740 --> 04:34:19.020
And that seems to speak badly about humanity.

04:34:19.020 --> 04:34:21.540
But there's also the exact opposite side of that

04:34:21.540 --> 04:34:24.380
where you have so many people that imbue humanity

04:34:24.380 --> 04:34:26.940
in inanimate objects or things that are toys

04:34:26.940 --> 04:34:28.900
or that are relatively limited.

04:34:28.900 --> 04:34:31.980
So I think there may even be more danger

04:34:31.980 --> 04:34:34.340
about people putting more emotional investment

04:34:34.340 --> 04:34:37.380
into a lot of these proto-AIs in different ways.

04:34:37.380 --> 04:34:38.580
Yeah.

04:34:38.580 --> 04:34:41.380
And then the AI would manipulate that.

04:34:41.380 --> 04:34:45.140
But as far as the AI ethnic sides of things,

04:34:45.140 --> 04:34:48.820
I really stay away from any of those discussions

04:34:48.820 --> 04:34:50.500
or even really thinking about it.

04:34:50.500 --> 04:34:52.620
It's similar with the safety things

04:34:52.620 --> 04:34:54.340
where I think it's just premature.

04:34:54.340 --> 04:34:56.300
And there's a certain class of people

04:34:56.300 --> 04:34:59.180
that enjoy thinking about impractical things,

04:34:59.180 --> 04:35:00.540
things that are not in the world

04:35:00.540 --> 04:35:04.020
and of pragmatic effect around you.

04:35:04.020 --> 04:35:06.340
And I think that, again,

04:35:06.340 --> 04:35:08.300
because I don't think there's gonna be a fast takeoff,

04:35:08.300 --> 04:35:11.020
I think we actually will have time to have these debates

04:35:11.020 --> 04:35:13.740
when we know the shape of what we're debating.

04:35:13.740 --> 04:35:15.820
And some people do take a principled approach

04:35:15.820 --> 04:35:17.420
that they think it's gonna go too fast,

04:35:17.420 --> 04:35:18.980
that you really do need to get ahead of it,

04:35:18.980 --> 04:35:20.580
that you need to be thinking about this

04:35:20.580 --> 04:35:22.660
because we have slow processes

04:35:22.660 --> 04:35:24.500
of coming to any kind of consensus

04:35:24.500 --> 04:35:26.940
or even coming up with ideas about this.

04:35:26.940 --> 04:35:30.900
And maybe that's true.

04:35:30.900 --> 04:35:33.300
I wouldn't put any of my money or funding

04:35:33.300 --> 04:35:34.620
into something like that

04:35:34.620 --> 04:35:36.820
because I don't think it's a problem yet.

04:35:36.820 --> 04:35:39.540
And I think that we will have these signs of life

04:35:39.540 --> 04:35:42.300
when we've got our learning disabled toddler,

04:35:42.300 --> 04:35:43.780
we should really start talking about

04:35:43.780 --> 04:35:45.780
some of the safety and ethics issues,

04:35:45.780 --> 04:35:47.780
but probably not before then.

04:35:47.780 --> 04:35:49.820
Can you elaborate briefly

04:35:49.820 --> 04:35:52.580
about why you don't think there'll be a fast takeoff?

04:35:52.580 --> 04:35:55.580
Is there some deep intuition you have about it?

04:35:55.580 --> 04:35:58.380
Is it because it's grounded in the physical world or why?

04:35:58.380 --> 04:36:00.420
Yeah, so it is my belief

04:36:00.420 --> 04:36:01.820
that we're gonna start off with something

04:36:01.820 --> 04:36:04.340
that requires thousands of GPUs.

04:36:04.340 --> 04:36:06.860
And I don't know if you've tried to go

04:36:06.860 --> 04:36:10.260
get a thousand GPU instance on a cloud anytime recently,

04:36:10.260 --> 04:36:11.580
but these are not things

04:36:11.580 --> 04:36:14.060
that you can just go spin up hundreds of.

04:36:14.980 --> 04:36:17.060
There are real challenges to,

04:36:17.060 --> 04:36:19.100
I mean, these things are gonna take data centers

04:36:19.100 --> 04:36:21.700
and data centers take years to build.

04:36:21.700 --> 04:36:24.260
And the last few years, we've seen a few of them

04:36:24.260 --> 04:36:26.220
kind of coming up, going in different places.

04:36:26.220 --> 04:36:27.980
They're big engineering efforts.

04:36:27.980 --> 04:36:30.340
You can hear people bemoan about the fact

04:36:30.340 --> 04:36:33.900
that I know the network was wired all wrong

04:36:33.900 --> 04:36:35.700
and it took them a month to go unwire it

04:36:35.700 --> 04:36:37.380
and rewire it the right way.

04:36:37.380 --> 04:36:40.740
These aren't things that you can just magic into existence.

04:36:40.740 --> 04:36:43.540
And the ideas of, like the old tropes

04:36:43.540 --> 04:36:45.300
about it's gonna escape onto the internet

04:36:45.300 --> 04:36:47.700
and take over other systems,

04:36:47.700 --> 04:36:49.620
the fast takeoff ones are clearly nonsense

04:36:49.620 --> 04:36:51.620
because you just can't open TCP connections

04:36:51.620 --> 04:36:53.940
above a certain rate, no matter how smart you are,

04:36:53.940 --> 04:36:56.060
even if you have perfect hacking ability,

04:36:56.060 --> 04:36:58.620
that take over the world in an instant sort of thing

04:36:58.620 --> 04:37:00.860
just isn't plausible at all.

04:37:00.860 --> 04:37:03.780
And even if you had access to all of the resources,

04:37:03.780 --> 04:37:06.420
these are going to be specialized systems

04:37:06.420 --> 04:37:08.580
where you're going to wind up with something

04:37:08.580 --> 04:37:11.660
that is architected around exactly this chip

04:37:11.660 --> 04:37:12.940
with this interconnect,

04:37:12.940 --> 04:37:15.140
and it's not just gonna be able to be plopped

04:37:15.140 --> 04:37:15.980
somewhere else.

04:37:15.980 --> 04:37:18.260
Now, interestingly, it is going to be something

04:37:18.260 --> 04:37:21.900
that the entire code for all of it

04:37:21.900 --> 04:37:23.300
will easily fit on a thumb drive.

04:37:23.300 --> 04:37:26.140
That's total spy movie thriller sorts of things

04:37:26.140 --> 04:37:29.180
where you could have, hey, we cracked the secret AGI

04:37:29.180 --> 04:37:30.700
and it fits on this thumb drive

04:37:30.700 --> 04:37:31.860
and anyone could steal it.

04:37:31.860 --> 04:37:32.860
Now they're still gonna have to build

04:37:32.860 --> 04:37:34.940
the right data center to deploy it

04:37:34.940 --> 04:37:37.540
and have the right kind of life experience curriculum

04:37:37.540 --> 04:37:39.980
to take it up to the point where it's valuable.

04:37:39.980 --> 04:37:41.180
But the real core of it,

04:37:41.180 --> 04:37:43.340
the magic that's gonna happen there

04:37:43.340 --> 04:37:45.140
is going to be very small.

04:37:45.140 --> 04:37:47.340
It's again, tens of thousands of lines of code,

04:37:47.340 --> 04:37:49.020
not millions of lines of code.

04:37:49.020 --> 04:37:50.940
It is possible to imagine a world,

04:37:50.940 --> 04:37:53.980
as you mentioned in the spy thriller view,

04:37:53.980 --> 04:37:57.100
if it's just a few lines of code,

04:37:58.780 --> 04:38:00.220
we can imagine a world

04:38:00.220 --> 04:38:02.460
where the surface of computation is growing,

04:38:02.460 --> 04:38:04.420
maybe growing exponentially,

04:38:04.420 --> 04:38:09.420
meaning the refrigerators start getting a GPU.

04:38:09.780 --> 04:38:13.660
And just, first of all, the smartphones,

04:38:13.660 --> 04:38:15.260
the billions of smartphones.

04:38:15.260 --> 04:38:20.260
But maybe if there become highways

04:38:20.660 --> 04:38:23.660
through which code can spread across the entirety

04:38:23.660 --> 04:38:25.540
of the computation surface,

04:38:25.540 --> 04:38:30.540
then you don't any longer have to book AWS, GPUs.

04:38:32.060 --> 04:38:34.100
There were real fundamental issues there.

04:38:34.100 --> 04:38:36.540
When you start getting down to taking an actual problem

04:38:36.540 --> 04:38:39.220
and putting it on an abstract machine like that,

04:38:39.220 --> 04:38:42.340
that has not worked out well in practice.

04:38:42.340 --> 04:38:45.340
And the idea that there was always,

04:38:45.340 --> 04:38:47.220
like it's always been easy to come up with ways

04:38:47.220 --> 04:38:48.900
to get compute faster,

04:38:48.900 --> 04:38:52.460
say more flops or more giga ops or whatever there.

04:38:52.460 --> 04:38:54.140
That's usually the easy part.

04:38:54.140 --> 04:38:56.060
But you then have interconnect

04:38:56.060 --> 04:38:58.940
and then memory for what goes into it.

04:38:58.940 --> 04:39:01.380
And when you talk about saying, well, cell phones,

04:39:01.380 --> 04:39:03.300
well, you're limited to like a 5G connection

04:39:03.300 --> 04:39:04.340
or something on that.

04:39:04.340 --> 04:39:08.620
And if you say how, if you take your calculation

04:39:08.620 --> 04:39:11.780
and you factor it across a million cell phones

04:39:11.780 --> 04:39:15.180
instead of a thousand GPUs in a warehouse,

04:39:15.180 --> 04:39:18.060
you might be able to have some kind of a substrate like that,

04:39:18.060 --> 04:39:22.300
but it could be operating then at one 1000th the speed.

04:39:22.300 --> 04:39:24.980
And so yes, you could have an AGI working there,

04:39:24.980 --> 04:39:26.660
but it wouldn't be a real time AGI.

04:39:26.660 --> 04:39:28.700
It would be something that is operating

04:39:28.700 --> 04:39:30.860
at really a snail's pace,

04:39:30.860 --> 04:39:34.620
much, much slower than kind of human level thought for things.

04:39:34.620 --> 04:39:36.700
So I'm not worried about that problem.

04:39:36.700 --> 04:39:39.260
You're transferring the problem into the interconnect,

04:39:39.260 --> 04:39:41.900
the communication, the shared memory,

04:39:41.900 --> 04:39:44.260
the collective intelligence aspect of it,

04:39:44.260 --> 04:39:46.100
which is extremely difficult as well.

04:39:46.100 --> 04:39:48.180
I mean, it's back to the very earliest days

04:39:48.180 --> 04:39:49.060
of supercomputers.

04:39:49.060 --> 04:39:50.900
You still have the balance

04:39:50.900 --> 04:39:53.940
between bandwidth storage and computation.

04:39:53.940 --> 04:39:56.860
And sometimes they're easier to get one or the other,

04:39:56.860 --> 04:40:00.300
but it's been remarkably constant across all those years

04:40:00.300 --> 04:40:02.300
that you still need all three.

04:40:03.820 --> 04:40:07.540
What do your efforts now, you mentioned to me

04:40:07.540 --> 04:40:11.340
that you're really committing to AI at this stage.

04:40:11.340 --> 04:40:13.100
What do you see your life

04:40:13.100 --> 04:40:15.660
in the next few months, years look like?

04:40:15.820 --> 04:40:18.540
What do you hope to achieve here?

04:40:18.540 --> 04:40:22.420
So I literally just this week signed a term sheet

04:40:22.420 --> 04:40:25.380
to take some investment money for my company

04:40:25.380 --> 04:40:29.420
where the last two years I had backed off from Meta

04:40:29.420 --> 04:40:32.660
and I was still doing my consulting CTO role there,

04:40:32.660 --> 04:40:35.180
but I had styled it as I was going to take

04:40:35.180 --> 04:40:37.500
the Victorian gentleman scientist route

04:40:37.500 --> 04:40:40.780
where I was gonna be the wealthy person

04:40:40.780 --> 04:40:42.540
that was going to go pursue science

04:40:42.540 --> 04:40:44.980
and learn about this and do experiments.

04:40:44.980 --> 04:40:47.500
And honestly, I'm surprised there aren't more people

04:40:47.500 --> 04:40:50.540
like that that are like me, technical people

04:40:50.540 --> 04:40:53.340
that made a bunch of money and are interested

04:40:53.340 --> 04:40:55.980
in some of these possibly the biggest leverage point

04:40:55.980 --> 04:40:57.420
in human history.

04:40:57.420 --> 04:41:00.820
I mean, I know of, I've heard of a couple organizations

04:41:00.820 --> 04:41:03.260
that are basically led by one rich techie guy

04:41:03.260 --> 04:41:06.860
that gets a few people around him to try to work on this,

04:41:06.860 --> 04:41:08.420
but I'm surprised that there's not more,

04:41:08.420 --> 04:41:10.420
that there aren't like a dozen of them.

04:41:11.580 --> 04:41:13.140
I mean, maybe people are still think

04:41:13.140 --> 04:41:14.740
that it's an unapproachable problem

04:41:14.740 --> 04:41:17.940
that it's kind of beyond their ability to get a wrench on

04:41:17.940 --> 04:41:20.060
and have some effect on like whatever startups

04:41:20.060 --> 04:41:24.380
they've run before, but that was my kind of,

04:41:24.380 --> 04:41:25.700
like with all the stuff I've learned,

04:41:25.700 --> 04:41:28.540
whether it's gaming, aerospace, whatever,

04:41:28.540 --> 04:41:30.580
I go through a larval phase where I'm like,

04:41:30.580 --> 04:41:33.180
okay, I'm sucking up all of this information,

04:41:33.180 --> 04:41:36.620
trying to see, is this something that I can actually do?

04:41:36.620 --> 04:41:38.460
Is this something that's practical

04:41:38.460 --> 04:41:41.300
to devote a large chunk of my life to?

04:41:41.340 --> 04:41:44.220
And I've gone through that with the AI,

04:41:44.220 --> 04:41:46.220
machine learning space of things.

04:41:46.220 --> 04:41:49.580
And I think I've got my arms around it.

04:41:49.580 --> 04:41:50.860
I've got the measure of it,

04:41:50.860 --> 04:41:53.260
where some of the most brilliant people in the world

04:41:53.260 --> 04:41:54.740
are working on this problem,

04:41:54.740 --> 04:41:58.380
but nobody knows exactly the path that it's going on.

04:41:58.380 --> 04:42:00.140
We're throwing a lot of things at the wall

04:42:00.140 --> 04:42:05.140
and seeing what sticks, but I have another interesting thing

04:42:05.140 --> 04:42:06.820
just learning about all of this,

04:42:06.820 --> 04:42:08.860
the contingency of your path to knowledge

04:42:08.860 --> 04:42:11.100
and talking about the associations and the context

04:42:11.100 --> 04:42:12.460
that you have with them,

04:42:12.460 --> 04:42:15.220
where people that learn in the same path

04:42:15.220 --> 04:42:17.460
will have similar thought processes.

04:42:17.460 --> 04:42:19.620
And I think it's useful that I come at this

04:42:19.620 --> 04:42:22.180
from a different background, a different history,

04:42:22.180 --> 04:42:23.700
than the people that have had

04:42:23.700 --> 04:42:25.900
the largely academic backgrounds for this,

04:42:25.900 --> 04:42:28.100
where I have huge blind spots

04:42:28.100 --> 04:42:30.060
that they could easily point out,

04:42:30.060 --> 04:42:33.500
but I have a different set of experiences in history

04:42:33.500 --> 04:42:35.820
and approaches to problems in systems engineering

04:42:35.820 --> 04:42:39.660
that might turn out to be useful.

04:42:39.660 --> 04:42:41.540
And I can afford to take that bet

04:42:41.540 --> 04:42:44.140
where I'm not gonna be destitute.

04:42:46.060 --> 04:42:48.340
I have enough money to fund myself working on this

04:42:48.340 --> 04:42:49.860
for the rest of my life.

04:42:49.860 --> 04:42:54.860
But what I was finding is that I was still not committing,

04:42:55.340 --> 04:42:58.940
where I had a foot firmly in the VR and meta side of things,

04:42:58.940 --> 04:43:02.660
where in theory, I've got a very nice position there.

04:43:02.660 --> 04:43:06.380
I only have to work one day a week for my consulting role,

04:43:06.380 --> 04:43:08.580
but I was engaging every day.

04:43:08.580 --> 04:43:10.300
I'd still be like, my computer's there,

04:43:10.300 --> 04:43:12.220
I'd be going and checking the workplace and notes

04:43:12.220 --> 04:43:15.860
and testing different things and communicating with people.

04:43:15.860 --> 04:43:19.380
But I did make the decision recently

04:43:19.380 --> 04:43:21.500
that no, I'm gonna get serious.

04:43:21.500 --> 04:43:24.460
I'm still gonna keep my ties with meta,

04:43:24.460 --> 04:43:28.380
but I am seriously going for the AGI side of things.

04:43:28.380 --> 04:43:30.140
And it's actually a really interesting point

04:43:30.140 --> 04:43:32.660
because a lot of the machine learning,

04:43:32.660 --> 04:43:34.780
the AI community is quite large,

04:43:34.780 --> 04:43:37.980
but really, basically almost everybody

04:43:37.980 --> 04:43:40.700
has taken the same trajectory through life

04:43:41.660 --> 04:43:42.660
in that community.

04:43:42.660 --> 04:43:44.540
And it's so interesting to have somebody like you,

04:43:44.540 --> 04:43:47.100
which are with a fundamentally different trajectory.

04:43:47.100 --> 04:43:49.300
And that's where the big solutions can come

04:43:49.300 --> 04:43:51.540
because there's a kind of silo

04:43:51.540 --> 04:43:54.380
and it is a bunch of people kind of following

04:43:54.380 --> 04:43:56.100
the same kind of set of ideas.

04:43:56.100 --> 04:43:59.380
And I was really worried that I didn't wanna come off

04:43:59.380 --> 04:44:02.460
as an arrogant outsider for things

04:44:02.460 --> 04:44:05.500
where I have all the respect in the world for the work.

04:44:05.500 --> 04:44:07.100
It's been a miracle decade.

04:44:07.100 --> 04:44:09.860
We're in the midst of a scientific revolution happening now

04:44:09.860 --> 04:44:12.540
and everybody doing this is,

04:44:12.540 --> 04:44:14.540
these are the Einstein's and Bohr's

04:44:14.540 --> 04:44:16.780
and whatever's of our modern era.

04:44:17.860 --> 04:44:20.060
And I was really happy to see that the people

04:44:20.060 --> 04:44:21.540
that I've sat down and talked with,

04:44:21.540 --> 04:44:24.540
everybody does seem to really be quite great about,

04:44:24.540 --> 04:44:26.100
just happy to talk about things,

04:44:26.100 --> 04:44:28.740
willing to acknowledge that we don't know what we're doing,

04:44:28.740 --> 04:44:30.940
we're figuring it out as we go along.

04:44:30.940 --> 04:44:34.580
And I mean, I've got a huge debt on this

04:44:34.580 --> 04:44:36.580
where it's all really started for me

04:44:36.580 --> 04:44:39.900
because Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to open AI

04:44:39.900 --> 04:44:42.820
and it was at a point when I didn't know anything

04:44:42.820 --> 04:44:46.700
about what was really going on in machine learning.

04:44:46.700 --> 04:44:48.340
And in fact, it's funny how the first time

04:44:48.340 --> 04:44:50.460
you reached out to me, it's like four years ago

04:44:50.460 --> 04:44:51.660
for your AI podcast.

04:44:51.660 --> 04:44:56.660
Yeah, for people who listening to this should know that,

04:44:59.740 --> 04:45:02.740
first of all, obviously I've been a huge fan of yours

04:45:02.740 --> 04:45:04.980
for the longest time, but we've agreed to talk like,

04:45:05.020 --> 04:45:06.580
yeah, like four years ago,

04:45:06.580 --> 04:45:07.620
back when this was called

04:45:07.620 --> 04:45:09.820
the Artificial Intelligence Podcast,

04:45:09.820 --> 04:45:13.060
we wanted to do a thing and you said yes.

04:45:13.060 --> 04:45:13.900
And then I said, it's like,

04:45:13.900 --> 04:45:15.620
I don't know anything about modern AI.

04:45:15.620 --> 04:45:16.460
That's right.

04:45:16.460 --> 04:45:18.740
I said, I could kind of take an angle on machine perception

04:45:18.740 --> 04:45:20.260
because I'm doing a lot of that

04:45:20.260 --> 04:45:22.060
with the sensors and the virtual reality,

04:45:22.060 --> 04:45:24.660
but we could probably find something to talk about.

04:45:24.660 --> 04:45:26.940
And then so, I mean, and that's where,

04:45:26.940 --> 04:45:30.180
when did Sam talk to you about open AI around the same time?

04:45:30.180 --> 04:45:32.220
No, it was a little bit, it was a bit after that.

04:45:32.220 --> 04:45:35.100
So I had done the most basic work.

04:45:35.100 --> 04:45:37.820
I had kind of done the neural networks from scratch

04:45:37.820 --> 04:45:39.820
where I'd gone and written it all in C

04:45:39.820 --> 04:45:42.260
just to make sure I understood back propagation

04:45:42.260 --> 04:45:45.580
at the lowest level and my nuts and bolts approach.

04:45:45.580 --> 04:45:48.140
But after Sam approached me,

04:45:48.140 --> 04:45:51.220
I was flattering to think that he thought

04:45:51.220 --> 04:45:53.700
that I could be useful at open AI,

04:45:53.700 --> 04:45:56.740
largely for kind of like systems optimization

04:45:56.740 --> 04:46:00.340
sorts of things, without being an expert.

04:46:00.340 --> 04:46:04.300
But I asked Ilya Sutskever to give me a reading list

04:46:04.300 --> 04:46:08.860
and he gave me a binder full of all the papers that like,

04:46:08.860 --> 04:46:10.580
okay, these are the important things.

04:46:10.580 --> 04:46:12.740
If you really read and understand all of these,

04:46:12.740 --> 04:46:15.540
you'll know like 80% of what most of the,

04:46:15.540 --> 04:46:17.540
the machine language researchers work on.

04:46:17.540 --> 04:46:19.660
And I went through and I read all those papers

04:46:19.660 --> 04:46:22.100
multiple times and highlighted them and went through

04:46:22.100 --> 04:46:24.300
and kind of figured the things out there

04:46:24.300 --> 04:46:25.740
and then started branching out

04:46:25.740 --> 04:46:28.140
into my own sets of research on things.

04:46:28.140 --> 04:46:30.820
And I actually started writing my own experiments

04:46:30.820 --> 04:46:33.420
and doing kind of figuring out,

04:46:33.420 --> 04:46:35.140
finding out what I don't know,

04:46:35.140 --> 04:46:36.660
what the limits of my knowledge are

04:46:36.660 --> 04:46:39.420
and starting to get some of my angles of attack on things.

04:46:39.420 --> 04:46:41.540
The things that I think are a little bit different

04:46:41.540 --> 04:46:44.540
from what people are doing.

04:46:44.540 --> 04:46:46.900
And I've had a couple years now,

04:46:46.900 --> 04:46:49.100
like two years since I kind of left

04:46:49.100 --> 04:46:51.540
the full-time position at Meta.

04:46:51.540 --> 04:46:54.740
And now I've kind of pulled the trigger and said,

04:46:54.740 --> 04:46:56.300
I'm gonna get serious about it,

04:46:56.300 --> 04:46:58.220
but some of my lessons all the way back

04:46:58.220 --> 04:47:00.900
to Armadillo Aerospace about how I know I need

04:47:00.900 --> 04:47:02.380
to be more committed to this,

04:47:02.380 --> 04:47:04.620
where there is that,

04:47:04.620 --> 04:47:07.020
it's both a freedom and a cost in some ways.

04:47:07.020 --> 04:47:08.900
When you know that you're wealthy enough to say,

04:47:08.900 --> 04:47:10.860
it's like, this doesn't really mean anything.

04:47:10.860 --> 04:47:12.820
I can spend, you know,

04:47:12.820 --> 04:47:14.780
I can spend a million dollars a year

04:47:14.780 --> 04:47:17.860
for the rest of my life and it doesn't mean anything.

04:47:17.860 --> 04:47:19.420
It's fine.

04:47:19.420 --> 04:47:22.780
But that is an opportunity to just kind of meander.

04:47:22.780 --> 04:47:25.780
And I could see that in myself when I'm doing some things.

04:47:25.780 --> 04:47:28.500
It's like, oh, this is a kind of interesting, curious thing.

04:47:28.500 --> 04:47:29.980
Let's look at this for a little while.

04:47:29.980 --> 04:47:31.060
Let's look at that.

04:47:31.060 --> 04:47:33.860
It's not really bearing down on the problem.

04:47:33.860 --> 04:47:37.060
So there's a few things that I've done

04:47:37.060 --> 04:47:39.300
that are kind of tactics for myself

04:47:39.300 --> 04:47:40.460
to make me more effective.

04:47:40.460 --> 04:47:43.380
Like one thing I noticed I was not doing well

04:47:43.380 --> 04:47:47.780
is I had a Google Cloud account to get GPUs there.

04:47:47.780 --> 04:47:49.620
And I was finding I was very rarely doing that

04:47:49.620 --> 04:47:52.340
for no good psychological reasons where I'm like,

04:47:52.340 --> 04:47:54.140
oh, I can always think of something to do

04:47:54.180 --> 04:47:56.860
other than to spin up instances and run an experiment.

04:47:56.860 --> 04:47:58.980
I can, you know, keep working on my local Titans

04:47:58.980 --> 04:48:01.860
or something, but it was really stupid.

04:48:01.860 --> 04:48:03.300
I mean, it was not a lot of money.

04:48:03.300 --> 04:48:05.860
I should have been running more experiments there.

04:48:05.860 --> 04:48:07.740
So I thought to myself, well,

04:48:07.740 --> 04:48:10.540
I'm gonna go buy a quarter million dollar DGX station.

04:48:10.540 --> 04:48:12.100
I'm gonna just like sit it right there

04:48:12.100 --> 04:48:14.220
and it's gonna mock me if I'm not using it.

04:48:14.220 --> 04:48:16.220
If the fans aren't running on that thing,

04:48:16.220 --> 04:48:18.540
I'm not properly utilizing it.

04:48:18.540 --> 04:48:19.620
And that's been helpful.

04:48:19.620 --> 04:48:22.220
You know, I've done a lot more experiments since then.

04:48:22.220 --> 04:48:24.940
It's been interesting where I thought I'd be doing

04:48:24.940 --> 04:48:27.260
all this low-level NVLink optimized stuff,

04:48:27.260 --> 04:48:29.940
but 90% of what I do is just spin up four instances

04:48:29.940 --> 04:48:32.820
of an experiment with different hyperparameters on it.

04:48:32.820 --> 04:48:33.820
Oh, interesting.

04:48:33.820 --> 04:48:37.140
You're doing like really sort of building up intuition

04:48:37.140 --> 04:48:39.380
by doing ML experiments of different kinds.

04:48:40.660 --> 04:48:44.340
But so the next big thing though is I am, you know,

04:48:44.340 --> 04:48:47.580
I decided that I was gonna take some investor money

04:48:47.580 --> 04:48:51.740
because I have an overactive sense of responsibility

04:48:51.740 --> 04:48:53.420
about other people's money.

04:48:53.420 --> 04:48:57.020
I am, and it's like, I don't want, I mean,

04:48:57.020 --> 04:49:00.380
a lot of my push and my passionate entreaties

04:49:00.380 --> 04:49:01.820
for things at Meta are it's like,

04:49:01.820 --> 04:49:03.740
I don't want Zuck to have wasted his money

04:49:03.740 --> 04:49:05.140
investing in Oculus.

04:49:05.140 --> 04:49:06.300
I want it to work out.

04:49:06.300 --> 04:49:07.700
I want it to change the world.

04:49:07.700 --> 04:49:10.500
I want it to be worth all of this time, money,

04:49:10.500 --> 04:49:12.180
and effort going into it.

04:49:12.180 --> 04:49:15.260
And I expect that it's going to be like that

04:49:15.260 --> 04:49:17.620
with my company where-

04:49:17.620 --> 04:49:20.180
That's a huge forcing function, this investment.

04:49:20.180 --> 04:49:23.300
Investors that are going to expect something of me.

04:49:23.300 --> 04:49:25.420
Now, we've all had the conversation

04:49:25.420 --> 04:49:28.260
that this is a low probability long-term bet.

04:49:28.260 --> 04:49:31.100
It's not something that there's a million things I could do

04:49:31.100 --> 04:49:33.940
that I would have line of sight on the value proposition for.

04:49:33.940 --> 04:49:34.860
This isn't that.

04:49:34.860 --> 04:49:38.220
I think there are unknown unknowns in the way,

04:49:38.220 --> 04:49:41.420
but it's one of these things that it's, you know,

04:49:41.420 --> 04:49:43.540
it's hyperbole, but it's potentially

04:49:43.540 --> 04:49:45.820
one of the most important things humans ever do.

04:49:45.820 --> 04:49:48.220
And it's something that I think is within our lifetimes,

04:49:48.220 --> 04:49:51.500
if not within a decade, to happen.

04:49:51.500 --> 04:49:54.820
So yeah, this is just now happening.

04:49:54.820 --> 04:49:56.860
Like term sheet, like the ink is barely,

04:49:56.860 --> 04:49:58.260
virtual ink's barely dry on us.

04:49:58.260 --> 04:49:59.180
It's drying.

04:49:59.180 --> 04:50:01.060
I mean, as I mentioned to you offline,

04:50:01.060 --> 04:50:02.980
like somebody I admire,

04:50:02.980 --> 04:50:04.740
somebody you know, Andre Capati,

04:50:04.740 --> 04:50:07.500
I think the two of you, different trajectories in life,

04:50:07.500 --> 04:50:10.220
but approach problems similarly in that

04:50:10.220 --> 04:50:13.260
he codes stuff from scratch up all the time.

04:50:13.260 --> 04:50:16.740
And he's created a bunch of little things

04:50:16.740 --> 04:50:21.740
outside of, even outside the course at Stanford

04:50:22.020 --> 04:50:24.020
that have been tremendously useful

04:50:24.020 --> 04:50:26.420
to build up intuition about stuff,

04:50:26.420 --> 04:50:27.740
but also to help people.

04:50:27.740 --> 04:50:30.060
And they're all in the realm of AI.

04:50:31.660 --> 04:50:34.340
Do you see yourself potentially doing things like this

04:50:34.340 --> 04:50:37.380
or, you know, not necessarily solving a gigantic problem,

04:50:37.380 --> 04:50:40.660
but on the journey, on the path to that,

04:50:40.660 --> 04:50:45.660
building up intuitions and sharing code

04:50:46.500 --> 04:50:51.500
or ideas or systems that give inklings of AGI,

04:50:52.540 --> 04:50:55.500
but also kind of are useful to people in some way?

04:50:55.500 --> 04:50:57.220
So yeah, first of all, Andre is awesome.

04:50:57.220 --> 04:50:59.700
I learned a lot when I was going through my larval phase

04:50:59.700 --> 04:51:02.180
from his blog posts and his Stanford course,

04:51:02.180 --> 04:51:04.140
and you know, super valuable.

04:51:04.140 --> 04:51:06.220
I got to meet him first a couple of years ago

04:51:06.220 --> 04:51:08.380
when I was first kind of starting off

04:51:08.380 --> 04:51:11.060
on my gentleman scientist bit.

04:51:11.060 --> 04:51:13.460
And just a couple of months ago

04:51:13.460 --> 04:51:15.420
when he went out on his sabbatical,

04:51:16.140 --> 04:51:17.620
he stopped by in Dallas and we talked for a while,

04:51:17.620 --> 04:51:19.660
and I had a great time with him.

04:51:19.660 --> 04:51:21.340
And then when I heard he actually left Tesla,

04:51:21.340 --> 04:51:24.180
I did, of course, along with a hundred other people say,

04:51:24.180 --> 04:51:26.660
hey, if you ever want to work with me,

04:51:26.660 --> 04:51:28.180
it would be an honor.

04:51:28.180 --> 04:51:30.380
So he thinks that he's going to be doing

04:51:30.380 --> 04:51:31.420
this educational work,

04:51:31.420 --> 04:51:32.940
but I think someone's going to make him an offer

04:51:32.940 --> 04:51:36.660
he can't refuse before he gets too far along on it.

04:51:36.660 --> 04:51:39.180
Oh, his current interest is education.

04:51:39.180 --> 04:51:42.820
I was like, yeah, he's a special mind.

04:51:42.820 --> 04:51:44.220
Is there something you could speak to

04:51:44.220 --> 04:51:47.500
what makes him so special from your understanding?

04:51:47.500 --> 04:51:50.660
He did, he was very much a programmer's programmer

04:51:50.660 --> 04:51:52.340
that was doing machine learning work

04:51:52.340 --> 04:51:56.020
rather than, it's a different feel than an academic

04:51:56.020 --> 04:51:57.900
where you can see it in papers sometimes

04:51:57.900 --> 04:52:00.100
where somebody that's really a mathematician

04:52:00.100 --> 04:52:01.500
or a statistician at heart,

04:52:01.500 --> 04:52:04.260
and they're doing something with machine learning.

04:52:04.260 --> 04:52:07.060
But, you know, Andre is about getting something done

04:52:07.060 --> 04:52:10.020
and you could see it in like all of his earliest approaches

04:52:10.020 --> 04:52:10.860
to it's like, okay,

04:52:10.860 --> 04:52:12.820
here's how reinforcement learning works.

04:52:12.820 --> 04:52:14.580
Here's how recurrent neural networks work.

04:52:14.580 --> 04:52:16.700
Here's how transformers work.

04:52:16.700 --> 04:52:19.300
Here's how crypto works.

04:52:19.300 --> 04:52:23.340
And I am, and yeah, it's just, he's a hacker's,

04:52:23.340 --> 04:52:25.460
you know, one of his old posts was like a hacker's guide

04:52:25.460 --> 04:52:26.660
to machine learning.

04:52:26.660 --> 04:52:28.020
And, you know, he deprecated that and said,

04:52:28.020 --> 04:52:29.820
don't really pay attention to what's in here,

04:52:29.820 --> 04:52:33.780
but it's that thought that carries through in a lot of it

04:52:33.780 --> 04:52:36.940
where it is that back again to that hacker mentality

04:52:36.940 --> 04:52:38.860
and the hacker ethic with what he's doing

04:52:38.860 --> 04:52:40.940
and in sharing all of it.

04:52:40.940 --> 04:52:43.620
Yeah, and a lot of his approach to a new thing,

04:52:43.620 --> 04:52:45.340
like you said, larva stage,

04:52:45.340 --> 04:52:48.740
is let me code up the simplest possible thing

04:52:48.740 --> 04:52:50.380
to build up intuition about it.

04:52:50.380 --> 04:52:52.780
Yeah, like I say, I sketch with structs and things

04:52:52.780 --> 04:52:54.580
when I'm just thinking about a problem,

04:52:54.580 --> 04:52:56.620
I'm thinking in some degree of code.

04:52:58.140 --> 04:53:01.460
You are also, among many things, a martial artist,

04:53:01.460 --> 04:53:03.100
both Judo and Jujitsu.

04:53:03.100 --> 04:53:07.220
How has this helped make you the person you are?

04:53:07.220 --> 04:53:09.220
So, I mean, I was a competent club player

04:53:09.220 --> 04:53:10.900
in Judo and grappling.

04:53:11.860 --> 04:53:13.980
I was by no means any kind of a superstar,

04:53:13.980 --> 04:53:17.180
but it was, I went through a few phases with it

04:53:17.180 --> 04:53:20.500
where I did some when I was quite young,

04:53:20.500 --> 04:53:22.260
a little bit more when I was 17.

04:53:23.260 --> 04:53:27.140
And then I got into it kind of seriously in my mid-30s.

04:53:27.140 --> 04:53:29.060
And I went pretty far with it,

04:53:29.060 --> 04:53:32.660
and I was pretty good at some of the things that I was doing.

04:53:32.660 --> 04:53:35.940
And I did appreciate it quite a bit where,

04:53:35.940 --> 04:53:37.500
I mean, on the one hand, it's always,

04:53:37.500 --> 04:53:39.220
if you're gonna do exercise or something,

04:53:39.220 --> 04:53:41.300
it's a more motivating form of exercise.

04:53:41.300 --> 04:53:43.340
If someone is crushing you,

04:53:43.340 --> 04:53:46.780
you are motivated to do something about that,

04:53:46.780 --> 04:53:49.660
to up your attributes and be better about getting out of that.

04:53:49.660 --> 04:53:51.740
Up your attributes, yes.

04:53:51.740 --> 04:53:56.740
But there's also that sense that I was not a sports guy.

04:53:57.140 --> 04:53:59.580
I did do wrestling in junior high,

04:53:59.580 --> 04:54:03.460
and I often wish that, I think I would have been good for me

04:54:03.460 --> 04:54:05.380
if I'd carried that on into high school

04:54:05.380 --> 04:54:07.060
and had a little bit more of that.

04:54:07.060 --> 04:54:08.780
I mean, it's like I, you know,

04:54:08.780 --> 04:54:10.820
filch a little bit of wrestling vibe

04:54:10.820 --> 04:54:13.460
with always going on about embracing the grind

04:54:13.460 --> 04:54:16.260
and like that push that I associate with the wrestling team

04:54:16.260 --> 04:54:20.060
that in hindsight, I wish I had gone through that

04:54:20.060 --> 04:54:21.900
and pushed myself that way.

04:54:21.900 --> 04:54:24.820
But even getting back into Judo and Jiu-Jitsu

04:54:24.820 --> 04:54:28.580
in my mid-30s as usually the old man on the mat with that,

04:54:28.580 --> 04:54:32.820
there was still the sense that, you know,

04:54:32.820 --> 04:54:36.620
working out with the group and having the guys

04:54:36.620 --> 04:54:38.860
that you're beating each other up with it,

04:54:38.860 --> 04:54:41.780
but you just feel good coming out of it.

04:54:41.780 --> 04:54:44.820
And I can remember those driving home,

04:54:44.820 --> 04:54:47.100
aching in various ways and just thinking,

04:54:47.100 --> 04:54:49.260
it's like, oh, that was really great.

04:54:49.260 --> 04:54:52.460
And, you know, it's mixing with a bunch of people

04:54:52.460 --> 04:54:54.220
that had nothing to do with any of the things

04:54:54.220 --> 04:54:55.820
that I worked with.

04:54:55.820 --> 04:54:56.700
You know, every once in a while,

04:54:56.700 --> 04:54:59.740
someone would be like, oh, you're the doom guy.

04:54:59.740 --> 04:55:03.340
But for the most part, it was just different slice of life,

04:55:03.340 --> 04:55:04.500
a good thing.

04:55:04.580 --> 04:55:07.180
And I made the call when I was 40.

04:55:07.180 --> 04:55:09.140
That's like, maybe I'm getting a little old for this.

04:55:09.140 --> 04:55:11.980
I had separated a rib and tweaked a few things.

04:55:11.980 --> 04:55:15.620
And I got out of this without any really bad injuries.

04:55:15.620 --> 04:55:18.020
And it was like, have I dodged enough bullets?

04:55:18.020 --> 04:55:20.140
Should I, you know, should I hang it up?

04:55:20.140 --> 04:55:24.180
I went back, I've gone a couple times in the last decade

04:55:24.180 --> 04:55:26.140
trying to get my kids into it a little bit.

04:55:26.140 --> 04:55:27.820
I didn't really stick with any of them,

04:55:27.820 --> 04:55:30.060
but it was fun to get back on the mats.

04:55:30.060 --> 04:55:32.780
I really hurts for a while when you haven't gone.

04:55:32.780 --> 04:55:34.460
I've gone for a while,

04:55:34.460 --> 04:55:37.740
but I still debate this pretty constantly.

04:55:37.740 --> 04:55:39.540
My brother's only a year younger than me

04:55:39.540 --> 04:55:41.980
and he's going kind of hard in jujitsu right now.

04:55:41.980 --> 04:55:43.700
And I, you know, he was just,

04:55:43.700 --> 04:55:46.100
he won a few medals at the last tournament he was at.

04:55:46.100 --> 04:55:46.940
So he's competing too.

04:55:46.940 --> 04:55:48.700
Yeah, and I was thinking, yeah,

04:55:48.700 --> 04:55:50.300
I guess we're in the executive division

04:55:50.300 --> 04:55:53.900
if you're over 50, you know, or over 45 or something.

04:55:53.900 --> 04:55:56.500
And it's not out of the question

04:55:56.500 --> 04:55:59.020
that I'd go back at some point to do some of this.

04:55:59.020 --> 04:56:02.020
But again, I'm just reorganizing my life around

04:56:02.020 --> 04:56:04.700
more focus, probably not going to happen.

04:56:04.700 --> 04:56:07.020
I'm pushing my exercise around

04:56:07.020 --> 04:56:10.260
to give me a longer uninterrupted intellectual focus time,

04:56:10.260 --> 04:56:11.660
pushing it to the beginning or the end of the game.

04:56:11.660 --> 04:56:13.500
Like running and stuff like that, walking.

04:56:13.500 --> 04:56:14.340
Yeah.

04:56:14.340 --> 04:56:17.460
Yeah, running and calisthenics and some things like that.

04:56:17.460 --> 04:56:19.940
But it allows you to still think about a problem.

04:56:19.940 --> 04:56:22.660
But if you're going to a judo club or something,

04:56:22.660 --> 04:56:23.500
you've got it fixed.

04:56:23.500 --> 04:56:25.020
It's going to be seven o'clock or whatever,

04:56:25.020 --> 04:56:27.140
10 o'clock on Saturday.

04:56:27.140 --> 04:56:29.020
Although I talked about this a little bit

04:56:29.020 --> 04:56:30.020
when I was on Rogan.

04:56:30.020 --> 04:56:32.900
And shortly after that, Carlos Machado did reach out

04:56:32.900 --> 04:56:36.100
and I had trained with him for years back in the day.

04:56:36.100 --> 04:56:38.940
And he was like, hey, we've got kind of a small private club

04:56:38.940 --> 04:56:41.740
with a bunch of executive type people.

04:56:41.740 --> 04:56:45.340
And it does tempt me.

04:56:45.340 --> 04:56:46.900
Yeah, I don't know if you know him,

04:56:46.900 --> 04:56:49.940
but John Donohert moved here to Austin

04:56:50.900 --> 04:56:52.540
with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks.

04:56:52.540 --> 04:56:55.260
And he has a very interesting way,

04:56:55.260 --> 04:56:58.620
very deep systematic way of thinking about jiu-jitsu

04:56:58.660 --> 04:57:01.820
that reveals the chest of it,

04:57:05.020 --> 04:57:06.620
the science of it.

04:57:06.620 --> 04:57:09.820
And I do think about that more as kind of an older person

04:57:09.820 --> 04:57:11.060
considering the martial arts,

04:57:11.060 --> 04:57:13.420
where I can remember the very earliest days

04:57:13.420 --> 04:57:15.300
getting back into judo and I'm like,

04:57:15.300 --> 04:57:17.180
teach me submissions right now.

04:57:17.180 --> 04:57:20.020
It's like, learn the armbar, learn the choke.

04:57:20.020 --> 04:57:22.460
But as you get older, you start thinking more about,

04:57:22.460 --> 04:57:24.420
it's like, okay, I really do want to learn

04:57:24.420 --> 04:57:26.180
the entire canon of judo.

04:57:26.180 --> 04:57:28.180
It's like all the different things there

04:57:28.180 --> 04:57:30.340
and like all the different approaches for it.

04:57:30.340 --> 04:57:32.260
Not just the, you know, if you want to compete,

04:57:32.260 --> 04:57:33.380
there's just a handful of things

04:57:33.380 --> 04:57:34.700
you learn really, really well.

04:57:34.700 --> 04:57:36.780
But sometimes there's interest in learning

04:57:36.780 --> 04:57:38.340
a little bit more of the scope there

04:57:38.340 --> 04:57:40.860
and figuring some things out from, you know,

04:57:40.860 --> 04:57:43.620
at one point I had, it wasn't exactly a spreadsheet,

04:57:43.620 --> 04:57:46.220
but I did have a, you know, a big long text file

04:57:46.220 --> 04:57:47.700
with like, here's the things that I learned

04:57:47.700 --> 04:57:50.300
and here are like ways you chain this together.

04:57:50.300 --> 04:57:53.700
And while, when I went back a few years ago,

04:57:53.700 --> 04:57:56.020
it was good to see that I whipped myself back

04:57:56.060 --> 04:57:58.780
into reasonable shape about doing the basic grappling.

04:57:58.780 --> 04:58:00.660
But I know there was a ton of the subtleties

04:58:00.660 --> 04:58:02.180
that were just, that were gone,

04:58:02.180 --> 04:58:04.980
but could probably be brought back reasonably quickly.

04:58:04.980 --> 04:58:06.420
And there's also the benefit.

04:58:06.420 --> 04:58:09.220
I mean, you're exceptionally successful now.

04:58:11.500 --> 04:58:13.340
You're brilliant.

04:58:13.340 --> 04:58:17.700
And the problem, the old problem with the ego is-

04:58:17.700 --> 04:58:20.060
I still pushed kind of harder than I should.

04:58:20.060 --> 04:58:22.940
I mean, that was, I was one of those people that I,

04:58:23.580 --> 04:58:26.980
I'm on the smaller side for a lot of the people competing

04:58:26.980 --> 04:58:29.540
and I would, you know, I'd go with all the big guys

04:58:29.540 --> 04:58:32.580
and I'd go hard and I'd push myself a lot.

04:58:32.580 --> 04:58:35.220
And that would be one of those where I would,

04:58:35.220 --> 04:58:37.660
I, you know, I'd be dangerous to anyone

04:58:37.660 --> 04:58:38.740
for the first five minutes,

04:58:38.740 --> 04:58:40.940
but then sometimes after that I'm already dead.

04:58:40.940 --> 04:58:42.580
And I knew it was terrible for me

04:58:42.580 --> 04:58:44.500
because it made the, you know,

04:58:44.500 --> 04:58:46.980
it meant I got less training time with all of that

04:58:46.980 --> 04:58:49.300
when you go and you just gas out, you know,

04:58:49.300 --> 04:58:50.700
relatively quickly there.

04:58:50.740 --> 04:58:53.860
And I like to think that I would be better about that

04:58:53.860 --> 04:58:55.500
where after I gave up judo,

04:58:55.500 --> 04:58:57.060
I started doing the half marathons

04:58:57.060 --> 04:58:58.980
and Tough Mudders and things like that.

04:58:58.980 --> 04:59:02.580
And so when I did go back to the local judokai club,

04:59:02.580 --> 04:59:04.460
I thought it's like, oh, I should have better cardio

04:59:04.460 --> 04:59:07.060
for this because I'm a runner now and I do all of this

04:59:07.060 --> 04:59:08.580
and didn't work out that way.

04:59:08.580 --> 04:59:11.780
It was the same old thing where just push really hard,

04:59:11.780 --> 04:59:13.540
strain really hard.

04:59:13.540 --> 04:59:16.220
And of course, when I worked with good guys like Carlos,

04:59:16.220 --> 04:59:19.260
it's like, just the whole flow like water thing is real

04:59:19.260 --> 04:59:20.580
and he's just like-

04:59:21.420 --> 04:59:22.260
That's true with judo too.

04:59:22.260 --> 04:59:24.020
Some of the best people like I've trained

04:59:24.020 --> 04:59:25.300
with Olympic gold medalists

04:59:25.300 --> 04:59:29.460
and for some reason with them, everything's easier.

04:59:29.460 --> 04:59:34.420
Everything is, you actually start to feel the science of it,

04:59:34.420 --> 04:59:36.940
the music of it, the dance of it.

04:59:36.940 --> 04:59:38.420
Everything is effortless.

04:59:39.780 --> 04:59:42.220
You understand that there's an art to it.

04:59:42.220 --> 04:59:43.540
It's not just an exercise.

04:59:43.540 --> 04:59:46.660
It was interesting where I did go to the Kodakon in Japan,

04:59:46.660 --> 04:59:49.300
kind of the birthplace of judo and everything.

04:59:49.300 --> 04:59:51.580
And I remember I rolled with one old guy.

04:59:51.580 --> 04:59:53.540
I didn't start standing,

04:59:53.540 --> 04:59:55.940
just started on groundwork and it was a,

04:59:55.940 --> 04:59:58.540
and it was striking how different it was from Carlos.

04:59:58.540 --> 05:00:00.740
He was still, he was better than me and he got my arm

05:00:00.740 --> 05:00:02.540
and I had to tap there,

05:00:02.540 --> 05:00:04.980
but it was a completely different style

05:00:04.980 --> 05:00:06.980
where I just felt like I could do nothing.

05:00:06.980 --> 05:00:08.140
He was just enveloping me

05:00:08.140 --> 05:00:11.180
and just slowly ground it down, put my arm and bent it

05:00:11.180 --> 05:00:14.580
while with Carlos, he's just loose and free

05:00:14.580 --> 05:00:15.580
and you always thought like,

05:00:15.580 --> 05:00:17.020
oh, you're just gonna go grab something,

05:00:17.020 --> 05:00:18.740
but you never had any chance to do it.

05:00:19.020 --> 05:00:20.100
It was very different feeling.

05:00:20.100 --> 05:00:21.660
That's a good summary of the difference

05:00:21.660 --> 05:00:23.260
between jiu-jitsu and judo.

05:00:23.260 --> 05:00:25.180
In jiu-jitsu, it is a dance

05:00:25.180 --> 05:00:26.940
and you feel like there's a freedom.

05:00:26.940 --> 05:00:30.020
And actually, anybody I tried,

05:00:30.020 --> 05:00:34.060
like Gordon Ryan, one of the best grappler in the world,

05:00:34.060 --> 05:00:35.980
Nogi grappler in the world,

05:00:35.980 --> 05:00:38.660
there's a feeling like you can do anything,

05:00:38.660 --> 05:00:41.660
but when you actually try to do something, you can't.

05:00:41.660 --> 05:00:42.940
Just magically doesn't work.

05:00:42.940 --> 05:00:44.780
But with the best judo players in the world,

05:00:44.780 --> 05:00:48.100
yeah, it does feel like there's a blanket

05:00:48.180 --> 05:00:50.340
that weighs a thousand pounds on top of you

05:00:50.340 --> 05:00:53.300
and there's not a feeling like you can do anything.

05:00:53.300 --> 05:00:54.780
You're just, you're trapped.

05:00:54.780 --> 05:00:57.660
And that's a style, that's a difference

05:00:57.660 --> 05:00:58.940
in the style of martial arts.

05:00:58.940 --> 05:01:01.940
But it's also, once you start to study,

05:01:01.940 --> 05:01:04.540
you understand it all has to do with human movement

05:01:04.540 --> 05:01:06.140
and the physics of it and the leverage

05:01:06.140 --> 05:01:07.060
and all that kind of stuff.

05:01:07.060 --> 05:01:09.380
And that's like, that's super fascinating.

05:01:09.380 --> 05:01:11.020
At the end of the day, for me,

05:01:11.020 --> 05:01:13.620
the biggest benefit is in the humbling aspect.

05:01:13.620 --> 05:01:18.620
When another human being tells you that there's a hierarchy

05:01:20.540 --> 05:01:25.540
or you're not that special.

05:01:25.540 --> 05:01:28.020
And in the most extreme case, when you tap to a choke,

05:01:28.020 --> 05:01:32.180
you are basically living because somebody lets you live.

05:01:32.180 --> 05:01:34.540
And that is one of those, if you think about it,

05:01:34.540 --> 05:01:36.500
that is a closer brush with mortality

05:01:36.500 --> 05:01:38.940
than most people consider.

05:01:39.940 --> 05:01:44.940
And that kind of humbling act is good to take to your work

05:01:45.380 --> 05:01:47.820
then where it's harder to get humbled.

05:01:48.980 --> 05:01:51.620
Yeah, because nobody that does any martial art

05:01:51.620 --> 05:01:54.500
is coming out thinking I'm the best in the world at anything

05:01:54.500 --> 05:01:56.380
because everybody loses.

05:01:57.380 --> 05:01:59.740
Let me ask you for advice.

05:01:59.740 --> 05:02:02.780
What advice would you give to young people today

05:02:02.780 --> 05:02:07.300
about life, about career, how they can have a job,

05:02:07.300 --> 05:02:09.500
how they can have an impact,

05:02:09.500 --> 05:02:11.980
how they can have a life they can be proud of?

05:02:12.980 --> 05:02:14.380
So it was kind of fun.

05:02:14.380 --> 05:02:17.740
I got invited to give the commencement speech back at the,

05:02:17.740 --> 05:02:21.460
I went to a college for two semesters and dropped out

05:02:21.460 --> 05:02:23.380
and went on to do my tech stuff,

05:02:23.380 --> 05:02:25.020
but they still wanted me to come back

05:02:25.020 --> 05:02:26.780
and give a commencement speech.

05:02:26.780 --> 05:02:29.260
And I've got that pinned on my Twitter account.

05:02:29.260 --> 05:02:32.380
I still feel good about everything that I said there.

05:02:32.380 --> 05:02:36.980
And my biggest point was that the path for me

05:02:36.980 --> 05:02:38.580
might not be the path for everyone.

05:02:38.580 --> 05:02:41.660
And in fact, the advice, the path that I took

05:02:41.660 --> 05:02:43.380
and even the advice that I would give

05:02:43.380 --> 05:02:46.140
based on my experience and learnings

05:02:46.140 --> 05:02:49.020
probably isn't the best advice for everyone

05:02:49.020 --> 05:02:52.580
because what I did was all about this knowledge in depth.

05:02:52.580 --> 05:02:56.340
It was about not just having this surface level ability

05:02:56.340 --> 05:02:57.740
to make things do what I want,

05:02:57.740 --> 05:02:59.860
but to really understand them through and through

05:02:59.860 --> 05:03:02.460
to let me do the systems engineering work

05:03:02.460 --> 05:03:05.180
and to sometimes find these inefficiencies

05:03:05.180 --> 05:03:06.500
that can be bypassed.

05:03:07.220 --> 05:03:10.260
And that the whole world doesn't need that.

05:03:10.260 --> 05:03:12.780
Most programmers don't, or engineers of any kind

05:03:12.780 --> 05:03:14.340
don't necessarily need to do that.

05:03:14.340 --> 05:03:16.060
They need to do a little job

05:03:16.060 --> 05:03:19.220
that's been parceled out to them, be reliable,

05:03:19.220 --> 05:03:22.980
let people depend on you, do quality work with all of that.

05:03:22.980 --> 05:03:26.420
But people that do have an inclination

05:03:26.420 --> 05:03:30.220
for wanting to know things deeper and learn things deeper,

05:03:32.380 --> 05:03:35.020
there are just layers and layers of things out there

05:03:35.020 --> 05:03:36.780
and it's amazing.

05:03:36.780 --> 05:03:40.100
If you're the right person that is excited about that,

05:03:41.220 --> 05:03:42.820
the world's never been like this before.

05:03:42.820 --> 05:03:43.780
It's better than ever.

05:03:43.780 --> 05:03:46.900
I mean, everything that was wonderful for me is still there

05:03:46.900 --> 05:03:49.420
and there's whole new worlds to explore

05:03:49.420 --> 05:03:52.020
on the different things that you can do.

05:03:52.020 --> 05:03:56.900
And that it's hard work, embrace the grind with it

05:03:56.900 --> 05:03:59.380
and understand as much as you can

05:03:59.380 --> 05:04:02.340
and then be prepared for opportunities

05:04:02.340 --> 05:04:05.180
to present themselves where you can't just say,

05:04:05.180 --> 05:04:08.020
this is my goal in life and just push at that.

05:04:08.020 --> 05:04:09.340
I mean, you might be able to do that,

05:04:09.340 --> 05:04:11.420
but you're going to make more total progress

05:04:11.420 --> 05:04:15.660
if you say I'm preparing myself with this broad set of tools

05:04:15.660 --> 05:04:19.140
and then I'm being aware of all the way things are changing

05:04:19.140 --> 05:04:20.460
as I move through the world

05:04:20.460 --> 05:04:22.500
and as the whole world changes around me

05:04:22.500 --> 05:04:24.180
and then looking for opportunities

05:04:24.180 --> 05:04:26.460
to deploy the tools that you've built.

05:04:26.460 --> 05:04:28.740
And there's going to be more and more

05:04:28.740 --> 05:04:30.380
of those types of things there

05:04:30.380 --> 05:04:32.820
where an awareness of what's happening,

05:04:32.820 --> 05:04:34.580
where the inefficiencies are,

05:04:34.620 --> 05:04:36.220
what things can be done,

05:04:36.220 --> 05:04:39.180
what's possible versus what's current practice

05:04:39.180 --> 05:04:40.860
and then finding those areas

05:04:40.860 --> 05:04:42.980
where you can go and make an adjustment

05:04:42.980 --> 05:04:46.140
and make something that may affect millions

05:04:46.140 --> 05:04:49.220
or billions of people in the world, make it better.

05:04:49.220 --> 05:04:52.100
When maybe from your own example,

05:04:52.100 --> 05:04:54.300
how were you able to recognize this about yourself

05:04:54.300 --> 05:04:57.220
that you saw the layers in a particular thing

05:04:57.220 --> 05:04:59.740
and you were drawn to discovering

05:04:59.740 --> 05:05:01.700
deeper and deeper truths about it?

05:05:01.700 --> 05:05:03.900
Is that something that was obvious to you

05:05:03.940 --> 05:05:05.860
that you couldn't help or is there some actions

05:05:05.860 --> 05:05:08.940
you had to take to actually allow yourself to dig deep?

05:05:08.940 --> 05:05:11.340
So in the earliest days of personal computers,

05:05:11.340 --> 05:05:13.500
I remember the reference manuals

05:05:13.500 --> 05:05:16.860
and the very early ones even had schematics of computers

05:05:16.860 --> 05:05:19.820
in the background, in the back of the books,

05:05:19.820 --> 05:05:21.980
as well as firmware listings and things.

05:05:21.980 --> 05:05:24.300
And I could look at that and at that time,

05:05:24.300 --> 05:05:25.980
when I was a younger teenager,

05:05:25.980 --> 05:05:28.020
I didn't understand a lot of that stuff,

05:05:28.020 --> 05:05:30.340
how the different things worked.

05:05:30.340 --> 05:05:32.940
I was pulling out the information that I could get,

05:05:32.940 --> 05:05:35.100
but I always wanted to know all of that.

05:05:35.100 --> 05:05:37.820
There was like kind of magical information

05:05:37.820 --> 05:05:39.860
sitting down there, it's like the elder lore

05:05:39.860 --> 05:05:43.460
that some gray beard wizard is the keeper of.

05:05:43.460 --> 05:05:46.900
And so I always felt that pull for wanting to know more,

05:05:46.900 --> 05:05:51.540
wanting to explore the mysterious areas there.

05:05:51.540 --> 05:05:54.540
And that followed right in through all the things

05:05:54.540 --> 05:05:57.060
that got the value, exploring the video cards

05:05:57.060 --> 05:06:00.900
leading to the scrolling advantages,

05:06:00.900 --> 05:06:03.020
exploring some of the academic papers and things,

05:06:03.020 --> 05:06:05.380
learning about BSP trees and the different things

05:06:05.380 --> 05:06:08.700
that I could do with those systems.

05:06:08.700 --> 05:06:12.420
And just the huge larval phases going through aerospace,

05:06:12.420 --> 05:06:15.220
just reading bookshelves full of books.

05:06:15.220 --> 05:06:17.100
I mean, again, that point where I have enough money,

05:06:17.100 --> 05:06:18.540
I can buy all the books I want.

05:06:18.540 --> 05:06:23.140
It was so valuable there where I was terrible with my money

05:06:23.140 --> 05:06:23.980
when I was a kid.

05:06:23.980 --> 05:06:25.380
My mom thought I would always be broke

05:06:25.380 --> 05:06:28.580
because I'd buy my comic books and just be out of money.

05:06:28.580 --> 05:06:30.980
But it was like all the pizza I want,

05:06:30.980 --> 05:06:34.780
all the diet coke I want, video games, and then books.

05:06:34.780 --> 05:06:36.300
And it didn't take that much.

05:06:36.300 --> 05:06:39.740
As soon as I was making 27K a year, I felt rich.

05:06:39.740 --> 05:06:42.340
And I was just getting all the things that I wanted.

05:06:42.340 --> 05:06:46.220
But that sense of, books have always been magical to me.

05:06:46.220 --> 05:06:48.260
And that was one of the things that really made me smile

05:06:48.260 --> 05:06:51.540
is Andre had said, when he came over to my house,

05:06:51.540 --> 05:06:53.700
he said he found my library inspiring.

05:06:53.700 --> 05:06:54.540
Just like that.

05:06:54.540 --> 05:06:56.260
And it was great to see, I used to look at him,

05:06:56.260 --> 05:06:57.300
he's kind of a younger guy.

05:06:57.300 --> 05:06:59.940
I sometimes wonder if younger people these days

05:06:59.940 --> 05:07:02.460
have the same relationship with books that I do

05:07:02.460 --> 05:07:05.940
where they were such a cornerstone for me in so many ways.

05:07:05.940 --> 05:07:08.420
But that sense that, yeah, I always wanted to know it all.

05:07:08.420 --> 05:07:09.660
I know I can't.

05:07:09.660 --> 05:07:11.340
And that was like one of the last things I said.

05:07:11.340 --> 05:07:12.860
You can't know everything,

05:07:12.860 --> 05:07:16.140
but you should convince yourself that you can know anything.

05:07:16.140 --> 05:07:18.180
Any one particular thing,

05:07:18.180 --> 05:07:20.820
it was created and discovered by humans, you can learn it.

05:07:20.820 --> 05:07:22.820
You can find out what you need on there.

05:07:22.820 --> 05:07:24.300
And you can learn it deeply.

05:07:24.300 --> 05:07:25.140
Yeah.

05:07:25.140 --> 05:07:28.260
You can drive a nail down through whatever layer cake

05:07:28.260 --> 05:07:31.980
problem space you've got and learn a cross section there.

05:07:31.980 --> 05:07:34.260
And not only can you have an impact doing that,

05:07:34.260 --> 05:07:37.700
you can attain happiness doing that.

05:07:37.700 --> 05:07:39.060
There's something so fulfilling

05:07:39.060 --> 05:07:41.180
about becoming a craftsman of a thing.

05:07:41.180 --> 05:07:42.900
Yeah, and I don't want to tell people that,

05:07:42.900 --> 05:07:44.940
look, this is a good career move,

05:07:44.940 --> 05:07:47.540
just grit your teeth and bear it.

05:07:50.780 --> 05:07:52.380
And I do think it is possible sometimes

05:07:52.380 --> 05:07:54.340
to find the joy in something.

05:07:54.340 --> 05:07:56.060
It might not immediately appeal to you,

05:07:56.060 --> 05:08:00.180
but I had told people early on in software times

05:08:00.180 --> 05:08:03.380
that a lot of game developers are in it

05:08:03.380 --> 05:08:05.900
just because they are so passionate about games.

05:08:05.900 --> 05:08:08.940
But I was always really more flexible

05:08:08.940 --> 05:08:11.500
in what appealed to me where I said,

05:08:11.500 --> 05:08:15.340
I think I could be quite engaged doing operating system work

05:08:15.340 --> 05:08:17.020
or even database work.

05:08:17.020 --> 05:08:19.340
I would find the interest in that

05:08:19.340 --> 05:08:21.580
because I think most things that are significant

05:08:21.620 --> 05:08:25.180
in the world have a lot of layers and complexity to them

05:08:25.180 --> 05:08:28.300
and a lot of opportunities hidden within them.

05:08:28.300 --> 05:08:30.540
So that would probably be the most important thing

05:08:30.540 --> 05:08:33.700
to encourage to people is that you can,

05:08:33.700 --> 05:08:35.500
it's like weaponized curiosity.

05:08:35.500 --> 05:08:38.340
You can deploy your curiosity to find,

05:08:38.340 --> 05:08:41.420
to kind of like make things useful and valuable to you

05:08:41.420 --> 05:08:43.980
even if they don't immediately appear that way.

05:08:43.980 --> 05:08:47.260
Deploy your curiosity, yeah, that's very true.

05:08:47.260 --> 05:08:49.220
We've mentioned this debate point,

05:08:49.220 --> 05:08:53.500
whether mortality or fear of mortality is fundamental

05:08:53.500 --> 05:08:56.420
to creating an AGI, but let's talk about

05:08:56.420 --> 05:08:58.620
whether it's fundamental to human beings.

05:08:58.620 --> 05:09:01.420
Do you think about your own mortality?

05:09:01.420 --> 05:09:03.020
I really don't.

05:09:03.020 --> 05:09:05.980
And you probably always have to like take

05:09:05.980 --> 05:09:07.860
with a grain of salt anything somebody says

05:09:07.860 --> 05:09:09.900
about fundamental things like that.

05:09:11.020 --> 05:09:16.020
But I don't think about really aging, impending death,

05:09:16.020 --> 05:09:19.740
legacy with my children, things like that.

05:09:19.740 --> 05:09:23.140
And clearly it seems most of the world does a lot,

05:09:23.140 --> 05:09:24.460
a lot more than I do.

05:09:25.460 --> 05:09:29.340
So I mean, I think I'm an outlier in that where it's,

05:09:30.260 --> 05:09:34.140
yeah, it doesn't wind up being a real part of my thinking

05:09:34.140 --> 05:09:35.980
and motivation about things.

05:09:35.980 --> 05:09:40.620
So daily existence is about sort of the people you love

05:09:40.620 --> 05:09:43.420
and the problems before you.

05:09:43.420 --> 05:09:47.060
I'm very much focused on what I'm working on right now.

05:09:47.060 --> 05:09:48.900
I do take that back.

05:09:48.900 --> 05:09:51.940
There's one aspect where the kind of finiteness

05:09:51.940 --> 05:09:53.660
of the life does impact me.

05:09:53.660 --> 05:09:56.940
And that is about thinking about the scope of the problems

05:09:56.940 --> 05:09:57.940
that I'm working on.

05:09:58.860 --> 05:10:00.260
When I decided to work on,

05:10:00.260 --> 05:10:02.460
when I was like nuclear fission or AGI,

05:10:02.460 --> 05:10:06.940
these are big ticket things that are impact

05:10:06.940 --> 05:10:08.700
large fractions of the world.

05:10:08.700 --> 05:10:11.700
And I was thinking to myself at some level that,

05:10:11.700 --> 05:10:15.980
okay, I mean, I may have a couple more swings at bat

05:10:15.980 --> 05:10:17.780
with me at full capability,

05:10:17.780 --> 05:10:22.300
but yes, my mental abilities will decay with age,

05:10:22.300 --> 05:10:23.220
mostly inevitably.

05:10:23.220 --> 05:10:25.380
I don't think it's a 0% chance

05:10:25.380 --> 05:10:26.860
that we will address some of that

05:10:26.860 --> 05:10:28.500
before it becomes a problem for me.

05:10:28.500 --> 05:10:31.780
I think exciting medical stuff in the next couple of decades,

05:10:31.780 --> 05:10:34.100
but I do have this kind of vague plan

05:10:34.100 --> 05:10:36.300
that when I'm not at the top of my game

05:10:36.300 --> 05:10:38.700
and I don't feel that I'm in a position

05:10:38.700 --> 05:10:40.660
to put a dent in the world some way,

05:10:40.660 --> 05:10:42.060
that I'll probably wind up doing

05:10:42.060 --> 05:10:44.780
some kind of recreational retro programming

05:10:44.780 --> 05:10:48.340
or I'll work on something

05:10:48.340 --> 05:10:50.300
that I would not devote my life to now,

05:10:50.300 --> 05:10:52.140
but I can while away my time

05:10:52.140 --> 05:10:54.380
as the old man gardening in the code worlds.

05:10:56.540 --> 05:10:59.740
And then to step back even bigger,

05:10:59.740 --> 05:11:01.980
let me ask you about why we're here.

05:11:01.980 --> 05:11:04.820
We human beings, what's the meaning of it all?

05:11:04.820 --> 05:11:07.060
What's the meaning of life, John Carmack?

05:11:07.060 --> 05:11:09.060
So very similar with that last question.

05:11:09.060 --> 05:11:12.460
I know a lot of people fret about this question a lot,

05:11:12.460 --> 05:11:14.220
and I just really don't.

05:11:14.220 --> 05:11:15.580
I really don't give a damn.

05:11:15.580 --> 05:11:18.580
We are biological creatures

05:11:18.580 --> 05:11:21.300
that happenstance of evolution.

05:11:21.300 --> 05:11:24.580
We have innate drives that evolution crafted

05:11:24.580 --> 05:11:27.780
for survival and passing on of genetic codes.

05:11:30.540 --> 05:11:32.220
I don't find a lot of value

05:11:32.220 --> 05:11:34.180
in trying to go much deeper than that.

05:11:34.180 --> 05:11:35.540
I have my motivations,

05:11:35.540 --> 05:11:38.860
some of which are probably genetically coded

05:11:39.660 --> 05:11:42.180
and many of which are contingent on my upbringing

05:11:42.180 --> 05:11:44.540
and the path that I've had through my life.

05:11:44.540 --> 05:11:48.900
I don't run into like spates of depression or ennui

05:11:48.900 --> 05:11:52.660
or anything that winds up being a challenge

05:11:52.660 --> 05:11:54.700
and forcing a degree of soul searching

05:11:54.700 --> 05:11:56.100
with things like that.

05:11:56.100 --> 05:11:59.900
I seem to be okay, you know, kind of without that.

05:12:01.300 --> 05:12:03.900
As a brilliant ant in the ant colony

05:12:03.900 --> 05:12:05.340
without looking up to the sky,

05:12:05.340 --> 05:12:07.100
wondering why the hell am I here again?

05:12:07.100 --> 05:12:07.940
Yeah.

05:12:08.500 --> 05:12:13.180
The why of it, the incredible mystery

05:12:13.180 --> 05:12:15.220
of the fact that we started,

05:12:15.220 --> 05:12:17.740
first of all, the origin of life on earth.

05:12:17.740 --> 05:12:20.740
And from that, from single cell organisms,

05:12:20.740 --> 05:12:22.980
the entirety of the evolutionary process

05:12:22.980 --> 05:12:26.100
took us somehow to this incredibly intelligent thing

05:12:26.100 --> 05:12:30.580
that is able to build Wolfenstein 3D and doom and quake

05:12:30.580 --> 05:12:33.780
and take a crack at the problem of AGI

05:12:33.780 --> 05:12:37.540
and create things that eventually supersede human beings.

05:12:37.540 --> 05:12:41.300
That doesn't, the why of it is.

05:12:42.380 --> 05:12:46.740
It's been my experience that people that focus on,

05:12:46.740 --> 05:12:49.900
that don't focus on the here and now right in front of them

05:12:49.900 --> 05:12:51.220
tend to be less effective.

05:12:51.220 --> 05:12:53.420
I mean, it's not a hundred percent, you know,

05:12:53.420 --> 05:12:55.460
vision matters to some people,

05:12:55.460 --> 05:12:59.500
but it doesn't seem to be a necessary motivator for me.

05:12:59.500 --> 05:13:02.260
And I think that the process of getting there

05:13:02.260 --> 05:13:05.460
is usually done against like the magic of gradient descent.

05:13:05.460 --> 05:13:08.580
People just don't believe that just looking locally

05:13:08.580 --> 05:13:11.060
gets you to all of these spectacular things.

05:13:11.060 --> 05:13:13.900
That's been, you know, the decades of looking at,

05:13:15.700 --> 05:13:17.660
really some of the smartest people in the world

05:13:17.660 --> 05:13:20.580
that would just push back forever against this idea

05:13:20.580 --> 05:13:24.300
that it's not this grand sophisticated vision of everything,

05:13:24.300 --> 05:13:27.260
but little tiny steps, local information,

05:13:27.260 --> 05:13:29.780
winds up leading to all the best answers.

05:13:29.780 --> 05:13:34.620
So the meaning of life is following locally

05:13:34.620 --> 05:13:36.660
wherever the gradient descent takes you.

05:13:37.740 --> 05:13:39.340
This was an incredible conversation,

05:13:39.340 --> 05:13:41.100
officially the longest conversation

05:13:41.100 --> 05:13:43.500
I've ever done on the podcast,

05:13:43.500 --> 05:13:45.900
which means a lot to me because I get to do it

05:13:45.900 --> 05:13:47.180
with one of my heroes, John.

05:13:47.180 --> 05:13:48.900
I can't tell you how much it means to me

05:13:48.900 --> 05:13:50.540
that you would sit down with me.

05:13:50.540 --> 05:13:52.180
You're an incredible human being.

05:13:53.180 --> 05:13:54.460
I can't wait what you do next,

05:13:54.460 --> 05:13:56.060
but you've already changed the world.

05:13:56.060 --> 05:13:58.140
You're an inspiration to so many people.

05:13:58.140 --> 05:14:02.580
And again, we haven't covered like most of what I was playing

05:14:02.580 --> 05:14:05.780
to talk about, so I hope we get a chance to talk someday

05:14:05.780 --> 05:14:08.620
in the future and I can't wait to see what you do next.

05:14:08.620 --> 05:14:10.340
Thank you so much again for talking to me.

05:14:10.340 --> 05:14:12.140
Thank you very much.

05:14:12.140 --> 05:14:14.900
Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Carmack.

05:14:14.900 --> 05:14:16.140
To support this podcast,

05:14:16.140 --> 05:14:18.780
please check out our sponsors in the description.

05:14:18.780 --> 05:14:20.740
And now let me leave you with some words

05:14:20.740 --> 05:14:22.300
from John Carmack himself.

05:14:23.420 --> 05:14:27.140
Focused hard work is the real key to success.

05:14:27.140 --> 05:14:29.060
Keep your eyes on the goal

05:14:29.060 --> 05:14:32.460
and just keep taking the next step towards completing it.

05:14:33.300 --> 05:14:35.340
If you aren't sure which way to do something,

05:14:35.340 --> 05:14:38.060
do it both ways and see which works better.

05:14:39.340 --> 05:14:42.260
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
