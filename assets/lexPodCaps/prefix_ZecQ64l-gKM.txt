00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
The following is a conversation with Lik Ronin,

00:02.720 --> 00:05.160
a chemist from University of Glasgow,

00:05.160 --> 00:06.680
who's one of the most fascinating,

00:06.680 --> 00:09.420
brilliant, out of the box thinking scientists

00:09.420 --> 00:10.660
I've ever spoken to.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.600
This episode was recorded more than two weeks ago,

00:14.600 --> 00:17.200
so the war in Ukraine is not mentioned.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.400
I have been spending a lot of time each day

00:19.400 --> 00:22.080
talking to people in Ukraine and Russia.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.920
I have family, friends, colleagues,

00:23.920 --> 00:27.340
and loved ones in both countries.

00:27.380 --> 00:30.260
I will try to release a solo episode on this war,

00:30.260 --> 00:31.920
but I've been failing to find the words

00:31.920 --> 00:36.020
that make sense of it for myself and others,

00:36.020 --> 00:37.620
so I may not.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.100
I ask for your understanding,

00:39.100 --> 00:40.660
no matter which path I take.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.460
Most of my time is spent trying to help

00:44.460 --> 00:46.280
as much as I can privately.

00:47.220 --> 00:49.380
I'm talking to people who are suffering,

00:49.380 --> 00:51.460
who are angry, afraid.

00:52.780 --> 00:55.740
When I returned to this conversation with Lee,

00:55.740 --> 00:56.980
I couldn't help but smile.

00:57.940 --> 01:01.620
He's a beautiful, brilliant, and hilarious human being.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.740
He's basically a human manifestation

01:03.740 --> 01:06.540
of the mad scientist Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.

01:08.020 --> 01:11.060
I thought about quitting this podcast for a time,

01:11.060 --> 01:13.340
but for now at least, I'll keep going.

01:14.180 --> 01:16.140
I love people too much.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.940
You, the listener.

01:17.940 --> 01:21.380
I meet folks on the street or when I run.

01:21.380 --> 01:23.660
You say a few kind words about the podcast,

01:23.660 --> 01:26.840
and we talk about life, the small things,

01:26.840 --> 01:28.280
and the big things.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.540
All of it gives me hope.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.400
People are just amazing.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.100
You are amazing.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.320
I ask for your support, wisdom, and patience

01:37.320 --> 01:41.560
as I keep going with this silly little podcast,

01:41.560 --> 01:44.000
including through some difficult conversations,

01:45.820 --> 01:49.500
and hopefully many fascinating and fun ones too.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.380
This is the Lux Freedman Podcast.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.440
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:56.440 --> 01:57.680
in the description.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.520
And now to your friends, here's Lee Cronin.

02:02.560 --> 02:05.800
How do you think life originated on Earth,

02:05.800 --> 02:09.400
and what insights does that give us about life?

02:09.400 --> 02:11.480
If we go back to the origin of Earth,

02:11.480 --> 02:16.480
and you think about maybe 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 billion years ago,

02:16.500 --> 02:17.640
planet was quite hot.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.780
There was a limited number of minerals.

02:19.780 --> 02:22.160
There was some carbon, some water,

02:22.160 --> 02:24.520
and I think that maybe it was a really simple

02:24.520 --> 02:28.280
set of chemistry that we really don't understand.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.680
So that means you've got a finite number of elements

02:30.680 --> 02:34.320
that are going to react very simply with one another,

02:34.320 --> 02:36.320
and out of that mess comes a cell.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.000
So literally sand turns into cells,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.060
and it seems to happen quick.

02:41.060 --> 02:44.520
So what I think I can say with some degree of,

02:44.520 --> 02:46.880
I think not certainty, but curiosity,

02:46.880 --> 02:50.320
genuine curiosity is that life happened fast.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.840
Yeah, so when we say fast,

02:53.080 --> 02:56.120
this is a pretty surprising fact,

02:56.120 --> 02:58.120
and maybe you can actually correct me and elaborate,

02:58.120 --> 03:02.560
but it seems like most, like 70 or 80% of the time

03:02.560 --> 03:04.480
that Earth has been around, there's been life on it,

03:04.480 --> 03:06.200
like some very significant percentage.

03:06.200 --> 03:11.200
So when you say fast, like the slow part is from single cell

03:11.460 --> 03:14.320
or from bacteria to some more complicated organism,

03:14.320 --> 03:17.560
it seems like most of the time that Earth has been around,

03:17.560 --> 03:21.600
it's been single cell or like very basic organisms,

03:21.600 --> 03:23.120
like a couple billion years.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.280
But yeah, you're right, that's really,

03:25.280 --> 03:30.000
I recently kind of revisited our history and saw this,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.840
and I was just looking at the timeline.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.400
Wait a minute, like how did life just spring up so quickly?

03:36.400 --> 03:38.200
Like really quickly?

03:38.200 --> 03:41.440
That makes me think that it really wanted to,

03:41.440 --> 03:45.980
like put another way, it's very easy for life to spring.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.820
Yeah, I agree, I think it's much more inevitable,

03:48.820 --> 03:52.780
and I think I try to kind of, not provoke,

03:52.780 --> 03:54.660
but try and push chemists to think about this,

03:54.660 --> 03:57.780
because chemists are central to this problem, right?

03:57.780 --> 04:00.040
Of understanding the origin of life on Earth, at least,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.380
because we're made of chemistry.

04:02.380 --> 04:05.340
But I wonder if the origin of life on a planet,

04:05.340 --> 04:07.220
or sorry, the emergence of life on the planet

04:07.220 --> 04:12.220
is as common as the formation of a star.

04:12.780 --> 04:15.420
And if you start framing it in that way,

04:15.420 --> 04:17.020
it allows you to then look at the universe

04:17.020 --> 04:18.980
slightly differently, because,

04:18.980 --> 04:21.560
and we can get into this, I think, in quite some detail,

04:21.560 --> 04:24.260
but I think, to come back to your question,

04:24.260 --> 04:27.820
I have little idea of how life got started,

04:27.820 --> 04:29.660
but I know it was simple,

04:29.660 --> 04:32.420
and I know that the process of selection

04:32.420 --> 04:36.340
had to occur before the biology was established,

04:36.340 --> 04:39.780
so that selection built the framework

04:39.780 --> 04:44.300
from which life kind of grew in complexity and capability

04:44.300 --> 04:46.340
and functionality and autonomy.

04:46.340 --> 04:48.380
And I think these are all really important words

04:48.380 --> 04:51.180
that we can unpack over the next while.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.140
Can you say all the words again?

04:53.140 --> 04:57.980
So you said selection, so natural selection,

04:57.980 --> 04:59.860
the original A-B testing.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.900
And so, and then complexity,

05:01.900 --> 05:05.500
and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication,

05:05.500 --> 05:09.020
because I think that people misunderstand what life is.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.020
Some people say that life is a cell,

05:12.020 --> 05:15.300
and some people that say that life is a virus,

05:15.300 --> 05:19.820
or life is an on-off switch.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.020
I don't think it's that.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.080
Life is the universe developing a memory,

05:25.020 --> 05:27.500
and the laws of physics, and the way,

05:27.500 --> 05:28.900
well, there are no laws of physics.

05:28.900 --> 05:32.900
Physics is just memory-free stuff, right?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.500
So there's only a finite number of ways

05:34.500 --> 05:38.620
you can arrange the fundamental particles to do the things.

05:38.620 --> 05:43.460
Life is the universe developing a memory.

05:43.460 --> 05:48.460
So it's like sewing a piece of art slowly,

05:49.380 --> 05:50.820
and then you can look back at it.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.620
So there's a stickiness to life.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.700
It's like the universe doing stuff,

05:58.700 --> 06:01.860
and when you say memory, it's like there's a stickiness

06:01.860 --> 06:04.100
to a bunch of the stuff that's building together.

06:04.100 --> 06:09.100
So you can, in a stable way, trace back the complexity

06:10.980 --> 06:13.100
that tells a coherent story.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.540
Yeah, and I think, yeah.

06:14.540 --> 06:19.540
Okay, that's, by the way, very poetic and beautiful.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.180
Life is the universe developing a memory.

06:24.220 --> 06:25.940
Okay, and then there's autonomy.

06:25.940 --> 06:27.620
You said complexity, we'll talk about,

06:27.620 --> 06:30.140
but it's a really interesting idea

06:30.140 --> 06:33.580
that selection preceded biology.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.100
Yeah, I think.

06:35.100 --> 06:38.420
So, first of all, what is chemistry?

06:38.420 --> 06:41.420
Like, does sand still count as chemistry?

06:41.420 --> 06:44.020
Sure, I mean, as a chemist, a card-carrying chemist,

06:44.020 --> 06:45.980
if I'm allowed a card, I don't know.

06:45.980 --> 06:46.820
Don't know what I am most days, actually.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.340
What is a card made of?

06:49.740 --> 06:52.180
What's the chemical composition of the card?

06:52.180 --> 06:53.900
Yeah, so what is chemistry?

06:53.900 --> 06:55.660
Well, chemistry is the thing that happens

06:55.660 --> 06:58.380
when you bring electrons together and you form bonds.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.380
So bonds, or I say to people

07:00.380 --> 07:02.420
when they talk about life elsewhere,

07:02.700 --> 07:04.820
and I just say, well, there's bonds, there's hope,

07:04.820 --> 07:07.020
because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.540
They allow you to record those memories,

07:09.540 --> 07:11.380
or at least on Earth.

07:11.380 --> 07:15.620
You could imagine a Stanislav Lemtri world

07:15.620 --> 07:17.260
where you might have life emerging

07:17.260 --> 07:19.700
or intelligence emerging before life.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.020
That may be something to do, like Solaris or something,

07:22.020 --> 07:27.020
but to get to selection, if atoms can combine

07:27.300 --> 07:31.940
and form bonds, those atoms can bond to different elements

07:32.500 --> 07:35.620
and those molecules will have different identities

07:35.620 --> 07:37.140
and interact with each other differently,

07:37.140 --> 07:39.940
and then you can start to have some degree of causation

07:39.940 --> 07:44.940
or interaction, and then selection, and then existence,

07:45.100 --> 07:49.820
and then you go up the path of complexity.

07:49.820 --> 07:52.980
And so, at least on Earth, as we know it,

07:52.980 --> 07:56.380
there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals

07:56.380 --> 08:01.380
to start searching that conventorial space of bonds.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
So, okay, this is a really interesting question.

08:03.500 --> 08:04.820
Let's lay it out.

08:04.820 --> 08:07.940
So, bonds, almost like cards.

08:07.940 --> 08:12.020
We say there's bonds, there is life,

08:12.020 --> 08:14.300
there's intelligence, there's consciousness.

08:14.300 --> 08:19.300
And what you just made me realize is those can emerge,

08:22.460 --> 08:24.620
or let's put bonds aside.

08:24.620 --> 08:27.180
Those can emerge in any order.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.820
That's really brilliant.

08:28.820 --> 08:32.180
So, intelligence can come before life.

08:32.180 --> 08:36.220
It's like panpsychists believe that consciousness,

08:36.220 --> 08:41.220
I guess, comes before life and before intelligence.

08:41.660 --> 08:43.900
So, consciousness permeates all matter,

08:43.900 --> 08:46.060
it's some kind of fabric of reality.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.980
Okay, so within this framework,

08:47.980 --> 08:50.020
you can arrange everything,

08:50.020 --> 08:52.380
but you need to have the bonds

08:53.940 --> 08:55.420
that precedes everything else.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.580
Oh, and the other thing is selection.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.860
So, like the mechanism of selection.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.820
That could precede,

09:02.820 --> 09:04.660
couldn't that precede bonds too?

09:04.660 --> 09:05.740
Whatever the hell selection is.

09:05.740 --> 09:09.260
So, I would say that there is an elegant order to it.

09:09.260 --> 09:13.580
Bonds allow selection, allows the emergence of life,

09:13.580 --> 09:15.860
allows the emergence of multicellularity,

09:15.860 --> 09:18.300
and then more information processing,

09:18.300 --> 09:19.700
building state machines all the way up.

09:19.700 --> 09:23.500
However, you could imagine a situation if you had,

09:23.500 --> 09:25.380
I don't know, a neutron star or a sun,

09:25.380 --> 09:28.660
or what, a ferromagnetic loops interacting with one another,

09:28.660 --> 09:31.100
and these oscillators building state machines,

09:31.100 --> 09:32.740
and these state machines reading something out

09:32.740 --> 09:34.300
in the environment.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.460
Over time, these state machines would be able

09:36.460 --> 09:39.340
to literally record what happened in the past

09:39.340 --> 09:41.580
and sense what's going on in the present

09:41.580 --> 09:43.140
and imagine the future.

09:43.140 --> 09:45.780
However, I don't think it's ever gonna be

09:45.780 --> 09:49.020
within a human comprehension, that type of life.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.500
I wouldn't count it out because, you know,

09:52.500 --> 09:54.060
whenever you, I know in science,

09:54.060 --> 09:55.900
whenever I say something's impossible,

09:55.900 --> 09:57.020
I then wake up the next day and say,

09:57.020 --> 09:57.860
no, that's actually wrong.

09:57.860 --> 10:00.540
I mean, there are some limits, of course.

10:00.540 --> 10:03.500
I don't see myself traveling fast and light anytime soon,

10:03.500 --> 10:04.340
but-

10:04.340 --> 10:05.620
Eric Weinstein says that's possible,

10:05.620 --> 10:06.660
so he will say you're-

10:06.660 --> 10:08.700
Sure, but I'm an experimentalist as well.

10:08.700 --> 10:11.540
So, one of my, I have two superpowers.

10:11.540 --> 10:14.540
My stupidity, and I don't mean that as a, you know,

10:14.540 --> 10:16.660
I'm like absolutely completely witless,

10:16.660 --> 10:19.020
but I mean my ability to kind of just start again

10:19.020 --> 10:22.260
and ask the question and then do it with an experiment.

10:22.260 --> 10:24.380
I always wanted to be a theoretician growing up,

10:24.380 --> 10:27.180
but I just didn't have the intellectual capability,

10:27.180 --> 10:30.620
but I was able to think of experiments in my head

10:30.620 --> 10:35.620
I could then do in my lab or when I was a child outside,

10:35.820 --> 10:37.860
and then those experiments in my head

10:37.860 --> 10:40.060
and then outside reinforced one another.

10:40.060 --> 10:41.380
So, I think that's a very good way

10:41.380 --> 10:44.380
of kind of grounding the science, right?

10:44.380 --> 10:46.700
Well, that's a nice way to think about theoreticians

10:46.700 --> 10:49.660
is they're just people who run experiments in their head.

10:49.660 --> 10:51.660
I mean, that's exactly what Einstein did, right?

10:51.660 --> 10:54.460
But you're also capable of doing that in the head,

10:54.460 --> 10:57.020
in your head, inside your head and in the real world

10:57.020 --> 10:59.460
and the connection between the two

10:59.460 --> 11:02.620
is when you first discovered your superpower of stupidity.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.460
I like it.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.460
Okay, what's the second superpower?

11:05.460 --> 11:08.460
Your accent or is that?

11:08.460 --> 11:09.300
Well, I don't know.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.620
I'm, I like, I am genuinely curious.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.820
So, my curious, so I have a, you know,

11:13.820 --> 11:15.060
like everybody ego problems,

11:15.060 --> 11:16.940
but my curiosity is bigger than my ego.

11:16.940 --> 11:20.300
So, as long as that happens, I can, I can, I can-

11:20.300 --> 11:21.340
Oh, that's awesome.

11:21.340 --> 11:22.300
That is so powerful.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.980
You're just dropping some powerful lines.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.820
So, curiosity is bigger than ego.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.180
That's something I have to think about

11:28.180 --> 11:30.860
because you always struggle about the role of ego in life

11:30.860 --> 11:35.860
and that's, that's so nice to think about,

11:36.260 --> 11:37.780
don't think about the size of ego,

11:37.780 --> 11:38.940
the absolute size of ego.

11:38.940 --> 11:42.180
Think about the relative size of ego to the other,

11:42.180 --> 11:44.100
the other horse is pulling at you

11:44.100 --> 11:46.620
and if the curiosity one is bigger,

11:46.620 --> 11:51.260
then ego will do just fine and make you fun to talk to.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.660
Anyway, so those are the two superpowers.

11:53.660 --> 11:55.340
How do those connect to natural selection

11:55.340 --> 11:58.500
or in selection and bonds and I forgot already,

11:58.500 --> 12:00.020
life and consciousness.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.100
So, we're going back to selection in the universe

12:02.100 --> 12:03.860
and origin of life on earth.

12:03.860 --> 12:06.540
I mean, selection is a,

12:06.540 --> 12:09.100
I'm convinced that selection is a force in the universe.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.140
So, not me, not a fundamental force,

12:11.140 --> 12:14.500
but a directing, but it is a directing force

12:14.500 --> 12:17.820
because existence, although existence

12:17.820 --> 12:19.180
appears to be the default,

12:20.100 --> 12:21.660
the existence of what, why does,

12:23.020 --> 12:24.340
we can get to this later, I think,

12:24.340 --> 12:29.140
but it's amazing that discreet things exist

12:29.140 --> 12:33.740
and you see this cup, it's not the sexiest cup in the world,

12:33.740 --> 12:35.020
but it's pretty functional.

12:35.020 --> 12:39.780
This cup, the complexity of this cup isn't just in the object,

12:39.780 --> 12:42.180
it is literally the lineage of people making cups

12:42.180 --> 12:44.460
and recognizing that, seeing that in their head,

12:44.460 --> 12:45.740
making an abstraction of a cup

12:45.740 --> 12:47.140
and then making a different one.

12:47.140 --> 12:50.460
So, I wonder how many billions of cups

12:50.460 --> 12:52.900
have come before this one

12:52.900 --> 12:55.060
and that's a process of selection and existence

12:55.060 --> 12:57.300
and the only reason the cup is still used is quite useful.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.140
I like the handle, it's convenient,

12:59.140 --> 13:01.700
so I don't die, I can keep hydration.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.900
And so, I think we are missing something fundamental

13:04.900 --> 13:07.060
in the universe about selection.

13:07.060 --> 13:12.060
And I think what biology is, is a selection amplifier

13:12.580 --> 13:14.940
and that this is where autonomy comes in

13:14.940 --> 13:17.300
and actually, I think that how humanity is gonna,

13:17.300 --> 13:20.420
humans and autonomous robots

13:20.420 --> 13:22.500
or whatever we're gonna call them in the future

13:22.500 --> 13:24.660
will supercharge that even further.

13:24.660 --> 13:26.860
So, selection is happening in the universe

13:26.860 --> 13:29.740
but if you look in the asteroid belt selection,

13:29.740 --> 13:33.540
if objects are being kicked in and out the asteroid belt,

13:33.540 --> 13:35.060
those trajectories are quite complex.

13:35.060 --> 13:37.060
You don't really look at that as productive selection

13:37.060 --> 13:40.020
because it's not doing anything to improve its function.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.860
But is it?

13:40.860 --> 13:43.700
The asteroid belt has existed for some time.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.500
So, there is some selection going on

13:45.500 --> 13:49.500
but the functionality is somewhat limited.

13:49.500 --> 13:53.380
On earth, at the formation of earth,

13:53.380 --> 13:56.820
interaction of chemicals and molecules in the environment

13:56.820 --> 13:59.300
gave selection and then things could happen

13:59.300 --> 14:01.780
because you could think about in chemistry,

14:01.780 --> 14:04.060
we could have an infinite number of reactions happen

14:04.060 --> 14:04.900
but they don't all,

14:04.900 --> 14:06.980
all the reactions that are allowed to happen don't happen.

14:06.980 --> 14:07.820
Why?

14:07.820 --> 14:08.860
Because there are energy barriers.

14:08.860 --> 14:12.060
So, there must be some things called catalysts out there

14:12.060 --> 14:14.660
or there are bits of minerals

14:14.660 --> 14:17.060
that when two molecules get together in that mineral,

14:17.060 --> 14:19.220
it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction

14:19.220 --> 14:21.580
and so the reaction is promoted.

14:21.580 --> 14:22.940
So, suddenly you get one reaction

14:22.940 --> 14:26.180
over another series of possibilities occurring

14:26.180 --> 14:28.140
that makes a particular molecule

14:28.140 --> 14:30.020
and this keeps happening in steps.

14:30.020 --> 14:31.620
And before you know it,

14:31.620 --> 14:34.420
almost these waves as discrete reactions work together

14:34.420 --> 14:38.100
and you start to build a machinery

14:38.100 --> 14:41.900
that is run by existence.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.980
So, as you go forward in time,

14:44.980 --> 14:47.020
the fact that the molecules,

14:47.020 --> 14:48.060
the bonds are getting,

14:48.060 --> 14:49.540
there are more bonds in a molecule,

14:49.540 --> 14:50.940
there's more function,

14:50.940 --> 14:52.500
there's more capability for this molecule

14:52.500 --> 14:55.340
to interact with other molecules to redirect them.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.180
It's like a series of little

14:57.180 --> 15:00.020
and I don't want to use this term too much

15:00.020 --> 15:01.180
but it's almost thinking about

15:01.180 --> 15:04.700
the simplest von Neumann constructor

15:04.700 --> 15:06.020
that's the simplest molecule

15:06.020 --> 15:07.580
that could build a more complicated molecule

15:07.580 --> 15:09.140
to build a more complicated molecule.

15:09.140 --> 15:10.020
And before you know it,

15:10.020 --> 15:11.460
when that more complicated molecule

15:11.460 --> 15:14.780
can act on the causal chain that's produced itself

15:14.780 --> 15:15.940
and change it,

15:15.940 --> 15:18.500
suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy

15:18.500 --> 15:21.860
and that's where life, I think, emerges in earnest.

15:21.860 --> 15:24.740
Every single word in the past few paragraphs,

15:24.740 --> 15:26.260
let's break those apart.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.020
Who's von Neumann?

15:29.020 --> 15:30.940
What's the constructor?

15:30.940 --> 15:33.900
The closing of the loop that you're talking about?

15:35.940 --> 15:37.980
The molecule that starts becoming,

15:38.020 --> 15:41.900
I think you said the smallest von Neumann constructor,

15:41.900 --> 15:43.340
the smallest, the minimal.

15:43.340 --> 15:45.460
So what do all those things mean

15:45.460 --> 15:48.020
and what are we supposed to imagine

15:48.020 --> 15:51.300
when we think about the smallest von Neumann constructor?

15:51.300 --> 15:54.260
So John von Neumann is a real hero,

15:54.260 --> 15:55.860
actually not just me but many people,

15:55.860 --> 15:58.620
I think computer science and physics.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.620
He was an incredible intellect

16:01.540 --> 16:03.060
who probably solved a lot of the problems

16:03.060 --> 16:04.180
that we're working on today

16:04.180 --> 16:06.580
and just forgot to write them down.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.500
I'm not sure if it's John von Neumann or Johnny

16:09.500 --> 16:10.780
as I think his friends called him,

16:10.780 --> 16:14.860
but I think he was Hungarian mathematician,

16:14.860 --> 16:18.580
came to the US and basically was involved

16:18.580 --> 16:21.460
in the Manhattan Project and developing computation

16:21.460 --> 16:24.300
and came up with all sorts of ideas

16:24.300 --> 16:25.700
and I think he was one of the first people

16:25.700 --> 16:27.460
to come up with cellular automata.

16:28.860 --> 16:29.700
Really?

16:29.700 --> 16:30.540
I didn't know this whole fact.

16:30.540 --> 16:32.380
I think so.

16:32.380 --> 16:34.860
Well anyway, if he didn't come up with it,

16:34.900 --> 16:37.260
he probably did come up with it and didn't write it down.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.820
There was a couple of people who did at the same time

16:38.820 --> 16:40.140
and then Conway obviously took it on

16:40.140 --> 16:42.620
and then Wolfram loves CAs,

16:42.620 --> 16:44.740
there is his fabric of the universe.

16:44.740 --> 16:48.340
And what I think he imagined was that he wasn't satisfied

16:48.340 --> 16:51.380
and this may be incorrect recollection,

16:51.380 --> 16:53.820
but a lot of what I say is gonna be kind of

16:55.060 --> 16:56.180
just way out of my...

16:56.180 --> 16:59.020
You're just part of the universe

17:00.380 --> 17:02.300
creating its memory, designing.

17:02.300 --> 17:04.180
Exactly, yeah, rewriting history.

17:04.860 --> 17:06.580
Exactly, imperfectly.

17:06.580 --> 17:09.100
But what I mean is I think he liked this idea

17:09.100 --> 17:14.100
of thinking about how could a Turing machine

17:14.300 --> 17:16.780
literally build itself without a Turing machine, right?

17:16.780 --> 17:19.620
It's like literally how did state machines emerge

17:19.620 --> 17:21.660
and I think that von Neumann constructors,

17:21.660 --> 17:24.780
he wanted to conceive of a minimal thing,

17:24.780 --> 17:28.420
autonoma, that could build itself

17:28.420 --> 17:30.700
and what would those rules look like in the world

17:30.700 --> 17:32.820
and that's what a von Neumann kind of constructor

17:32.820 --> 17:35.500
looked like, like it's a minimal hypothetical object

17:35.500 --> 17:37.900
that could build itself, self-replicate.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.340
And I'm really fascinated by that

17:41.340 --> 17:45.100
because I think that although it's probably not

17:45.100 --> 17:47.980
exactly what happened, it's a nice model

17:47.980 --> 17:49.540
because as chemists, if we could go back

17:49.540 --> 17:51.980
to the origin of life and think about

17:51.980 --> 17:55.980
what is a minimal machine that can get structured randomly,

17:55.980 --> 18:00.980
so like with no prime mover, with no architect,

18:01.220 --> 18:03.580
it assembles through just existence.

18:03.580 --> 18:06.180
So random stuff bumping in together

18:06.180 --> 18:07.820
and you make this first molecule.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.500
So you have molecule A and molecule A interacts

18:11.500 --> 18:14.060
with another random molecule B and they get together

18:14.060 --> 18:15.500
and they realize by working together,

18:15.500 --> 18:17.580
they can make more of themselves

18:17.580 --> 18:19.540
but then they realize they can mutate

18:19.540 --> 18:21.420
so they can make AB prime.

18:21.420 --> 18:25.940
So AB prime's different to AB and then AB prime

18:25.940 --> 18:29.500
can then act back where A and B were being created

18:29.540 --> 18:32.940
and slightly nudge that causal chain

18:32.940 --> 18:37.940
and make AB prime more evolvable or learn more.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.540
So that's the closing the loop part.

18:40.540 --> 18:42.020
Closing the loop part, got it.

18:42.020 --> 18:46.900
It feels like the mutation part is not that difficult.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.660
It feels like the difficult part is just creating

18:48.660 --> 18:50.860
a copy of yourself as step one.

18:50.860 --> 18:55.860
It seems like one of the greatest inventions

18:56.180 --> 18:57.580
in the history of the universe

18:57.580 --> 19:01.620
is the first molecule that figured out,

19:01.620 --> 19:04.620
holy shit, I can create a copy of myself.

19:04.620 --> 19:06.940
How hard is that?

19:06.940 --> 19:09.740
I think it's really, really easy.

19:09.740 --> 19:10.980
Okay, I did not expect that.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.620
I think it's really, really easy.

19:12.620 --> 19:15.140
Well, let's take a step back.

19:15.140 --> 19:19.260
I think replicating molecules are rare

19:19.260 --> 19:22.060
but if you say, I think I was saying on,

19:22.060 --> 19:23.780
I probably got into trouble on Twitter.

19:23.780 --> 19:24.940
I was trying to work this.

19:24.940 --> 19:27.180
There's about more than 18 mils of water in there

19:27.180 --> 19:31.700
so one mole of water, 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.580
That's about the number of stars in the universe,

19:33.580 --> 19:34.660
I think, of the order.

19:34.660 --> 19:36.180
So there's three universe worth.

19:36.180 --> 19:37.020
But between one and-

19:37.020 --> 19:38.460
Oh, did somebody corrected you on Twitter?

19:38.460 --> 19:40.860
Yeah, as if I'm always being corrected.

19:40.860 --> 19:43.100
It's a great fact but there's a lot of molecules

19:43.100 --> 19:46.060
in the water and so there's a lot of,

19:46.060 --> 19:49.540
so although it's for you and me really hard to conceive of,

19:49.540 --> 19:54.540
if existence is not the default for a long period of time

19:55.220 --> 19:57.820
because what happens is the molecules get degraded.

19:57.820 --> 20:00.060
So much of the possibilities in the universe

20:00.060 --> 20:01.860
are just broken back into atoms.

20:01.860 --> 20:06.020
So you have this kind of destruction of the molecules

20:06.020 --> 20:07.700
for our chemical reactions.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.980
So you only need one or two molecules

20:09.980 --> 20:12.260
to become good at copying themselves

20:12.260 --> 20:15.060
for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool

20:15.060 --> 20:16.380
and start to grow.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.940
And so then replication actually over time

20:18.940 --> 20:23.020
when you have bonds I think is much simpler, much easier.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.540
And I even found this in my lab years ago.

20:25.540 --> 20:29.460
I had one of the reasons I started doing inorganic chemistry

20:29.460 --> 20:31.460
and making rust, making a bit of rust

20:31.460 --> 20:35.020
based on a thing called molybdenum, molybdenum oxide.

20:35.020 --> 20:37.100
Is this molybdenum oxide?

20:37.100 --> 20:38.620
Very simple.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.940
But when you add acid to it and some electrons,

20:40.940 --> 20:44.700
they make these molecules you just cannot possibly imagine

20:44.700 --> 20:46.980
would be constructed big gigantic wheels

20:46.980 --> 20:50.180
of 154 molybdenum atoms in a wheel

20:50.220 --> 20:54.420
or icosadodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms

20:54.420 --> 20:55.500
all in the same pot.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.980
And I realized when I,

20:56.980 --> 20:58.820
and I just finished experiments two years ago,

20:58.820 --> 21:00.980
I've just published a couple of papers on this

21:00.980 --> 21:05.140
that they're actually, there is a random small molecule

21:05.140 --> 21:07.900
with 12 atoms in it that can form randomly

21:07.900 --> 21:10.900
but it happens to template its own production.

21:10.900 --> 21:14.100
And then by chance it templates the ring,

21:14.100 --> 21:17.340
just an accident, just like, just an absolute accident.

21:17.340 --> 21:22.020
And that ring also helps make the small 12 mer.

21:22.020 --> 21:25.540
And so you have what's called an autocatalytic set

21:25.540 --> 21:30.540
where A makes B and B helps make A and vice versa

21:32.900 --> 21:34.580
and you then make this loop.

21:34.580 --> 21:39.580
So it's a bit like these, they all work in synergy

21:40.060 --> 21:43.540
to make this chain of events that grow.

21:43.540 --> 21:46.620
And it doesn't take a very sophisticated model

21:46.620 --> 21:50.580
to show that if you have these objects are competing

21:50.580 --> 21:53.340
and then collaborating to help one another build,

21:53.340 --> 21:55.060
they just grow out of the mess.

21:55.060 --> 21:58.340
And although they seem improbable, they are improbable,

21:58.340 --> 22:01.580
in fact impossible in one step.

22:01.580 --> 22:02.820
There's multiple steps.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.340
This is when the blind people look

22:04.340 --> 22:06.700
at the blind watchmaker argument

22:06.700 --> 22:08.340
when you're talking about how could a watch

22:08.340 --> 22:10.900
suddenly spontaneously emerge?

22:10.900 --> 22:13.340
Well, it doesn't, it's a lineage of watches

22:13.340 --> 22:17.860
and cruder devices that are bootstrapped onto one another.

22:19.220 --> 22:23.300
Right, so it's very improbable,

22:23.300 --> 22:25.460
but once you get that little discovery,

22:25.460 --> 22:29.620
like with the wheel and fire,

22:29.620 --> 22:34.620
it just explodes because it's so successful, it explodes.

22:35.060 --> 22:37.820
It's basically selection.

22:37.820 --> 22:40.540
So this templating mechanism that allows you

22:40.540 --> 22:43.460
to have a little blueprint for yourself,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.100
how you go through different procedures

22:45.100 --> 22:46.620
is to build copies of yourself.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.940
So in chemistry somehow it's possible to imagine

22:52.940 --> 22:57.020
that that kind of thing is easy to spring up.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.820
In more complex organisms, it feels like a different thing

22:59.820 --> 23:01.700
and much more complicated.

23:01.700 --> 23:05.100
We're having multiple abstractions of the birds

23:05.100 --> 23:06.820
and the bees conversation here,

23:06.820 --> 23:10.260
but with human, sorry, with complex organisms,

23:10.940 --> 23:12.740
it feels like difficult to have reproduction.

23:15.940 --> 23:18.820
That's gonna get clipped out, I'm gonna make fun of that.

23:20.820 --> 23:23.900
It's difficult to develop this idea

23:23.900 --> 23:25.860
of making copies of yourself or no,

23:26.900 --> 23:30.260
because that seems like a magical idea for life to,

23:32.180 --> 23:36.580
wow, that feels like very necessary for what selection is,

23:36.580 --> 23:37.780
for what evolution is,

23:37.780 --> 23:40.660
but then if selection precedes all of this,

23:40.660 --> 23:43.500
then maybe these are just like echoes

23:43.500 --> 23:47.420
of the selecting mechanism at different scales.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.460
Yeah, that's exactly it.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.740
So selection is the default in the universe,

23:50.740 --> 23:54.860
if you want to, and what happens is that life,

23:54.860 --> 23:57.700
the solution that life has got on earth,

23:57.700 --> 24:01.340
life on earth, biology on earth is unique to earth,

24:01.340 --> 24:03.260
we can talk about that,

24:03.260 --> 24:05.780
and that was really hard fought for,

24:05.780 --> 24:08.700
but that is the solution that works on earth,

24:08.700 --> 24:10.660
the ribosome, the fundamental machine

24:10.660 --> 24:15.220
that is responsible for every cell on earth,

24:15.220 --> 24:18.540
of wherever it is in the kingdom of life.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.220
That is an incredibly complex object,

24:21.220 --> 24:22.900
but it was evolved over time,

24:22.900 --> 24:24.660
and it wasn't involved in a vacuum,

24:24.660 --> 24:26.820
and I think that once we understand

24:26.820 --> 24:31.820
that selection can occur without the ribosome,

24:32.780 --> 24:34.220
but what the ribosome does,

24:34.220 --> 24:37.220
it's a phase transition in replication,

24:37.220 --> 24:39.620
and I think that that, and also technology,

24:39.620 --> 24:44.620
that is probably much easier to get to than we think.

24:45.780 --> 24:50.820
Why do you put the ribosome as a central part

24:50.820 --> 24:52.420
of living organisms on earth?

24:52.420 --> 24:53.700
It basically is a combination

24:53.700 --> 24:57.260
of two different polymer systems, so RNA and peptides,

24:57.260 --> 24:59.500
so the RNA world, if you like,

24:59.500 --> 25:02.420
gets transmitted and builds proteins,

25:02.420 --> 25:03.700
and the proteins are responsible

25:03.700 --> 25:05.180
for all the catalysis,

25:05.180 --> 25:07.300
the majority of the catalysis that goes on in the cell.

25:07.300 --> 25:11.460
No ribosome, no proteins, no decoding, no evolution.

25:11.460 --> 25:14.300
So ribosome is looking at the action.

25:14.300 --> 25:18.060
You don't put the RNA itself as the critical thing.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.780
Information, you put action as the most important thing.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.300
I think the actual molecules that we have in biology

25:23.300 --> 25:24.780
right now are entirely contingent

25:24.780 --> 25:27.300
on the history of life on earth.

25:27.300 --> 25:29.020
There are so many possible solutions,

25:29.020 --> 25:31.100
and this is where chemistry got itself into,

25:31.100 --> 25:32.060
the origin of life chemistry

25:32.060 --> 25:33.420
gets itself into a bit of a trap.

25:33.420 --> 25:35.260
Yeah, let me interrupt you there.

25:35.260 --> 25:36.820
You've tweeted, you're gonna get,

25:36.820 --> 25:40.540
I'm gonna cite your tweets like it's Shakespeare, okay?

25:40.540 --> 25:43.740
It's surprising you haven't gotten canceled on Twitter yet.

25:43.740 --> 25:45.620
Your brilliance once again saves you.

25:46.660 --> 25:47.500
I'm just kidding.

25:49.020 --> 25:51.300
You like to have a little bit of fun on Twitter.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.780
You've tweeted that, quote,

25:52.780 --> 25:56.020
origin of life research is a scam.

25:56.860 --> 26:00.180
So if this is Shakespeare, can we analyze this word?

26:00.180 --> 26:02.300
Why is the origin of life research a scam?

26:02.300 --> 26:05.220
Aren't you kind of doing origin of life research?

26:06.740 --> 26:07.860
Okay, it was tongue in cheek,

26:07.860 --> 26:10.900
but yeah, I think, and I meant it as tongue in cheek.

26:10.900 --> 26:14.420
I am, I'm not doing the origin of life research.

26:14.420 --> 26:16.780
I'm trying to make artificial life.

26:16.780 --> 26:20.060
And I also want to bound the likelihood

26:20.060 --> 26:21.300
of the origin of life on earth,

26:21.300 --> 26:23.780
but more importantly to find origin of life elsewhere.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.980
But let me directly address the tweet.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.900
There are many, many good chemists out there

26:27.900 --> 26:31.460
doing origin of life research, but I want to nudge them.

26:31.540 --> 26:35.300
And I think they're brilliant, like there's no question.

26:35.300 --> 26:38.820
The chemistry they are doing, the motivation is great.

26:38.820 --> 26:40.580
So what I meant by that tweet is saying

26:40.580 --> 26:43.020
that maybe they're making assumptions about saying,

26:43.020 --> 26:47.460
if only I could make this particular type of molecule,

26:47.460 --> 26:52.140
say this RNA molecule or this phosphodiester

26:52.140 --> 26:54.180
or this other molecule,

26:54.180 --> 26:57.820
it's gonna somehow unlock the origin of life.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.580
And I think that origin of life has been looking at this

27:00.580 --> 27:01.980
for a very long time.

27:01.980 --> 27:05.700
And whilst I think it's brilliant to work out

27:05.700 --> 27:08.220
how you can get to those molecules,

27:08.220 --> 27:11.460
I think that chemistry and chemists doing origin of life

27:11.460 --> 27:15.940
could be nudged into doing something even more profound.

27:15.940 --> 27:20.300
And so the argument I'm making, it's a bit like right now,

27:20.300 --> 27:22.980
let's say, I don't know, the first Tesla

27:22.980 --> 27:25.860
that makes its way to, I don't know,

27:25.860 --> 27:27.060
into a new country in the world.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.700
Let's say there's country X

27:29.700 --> 27:31.180
that has never had a Tesla before

27:31.180 --> 27:32.020
and they get the Tesla.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.380
Russia.

27:33.380 --> 27:35.660
And what they do is they take the Tesla apart

27:35.660 --> 27:38.420
and say, we wanna find the origin of cars in the universe

27:38.420 --> 27:41.100
and say, okay, how did this form and how did this form?

27:41.100 --> 27:43.700
And they just randomly keep making till they make the door,

27:43.700 --> 27:45.300
they make the wheel, they make the steering column

27:45.300 --> 27:46.220
and all this stuff.

27:46.220 --> 27:48.140
And they say, oh, that's the route.

27:48.140 --> 27:50.420
That's the way cars emerged on earth.

27:50.420 --> 27:53.340
But actually we know that there's a causal chain of cars

27:53.340 --> 27:56.100
going right back to Henry Ford and the Horson carriage.

27:56.140 --> 28:00.340
And before that, maybe where people were using wheels.

28:00.340 --> 28:04.380
And I think that obsession with the identities

28:04.380 --> 28:06.140
that we see in biology right now

28:06.140 --> 28:09.260
are giving us a false sense of security

28:09.260 --> 28:10.980
about what we're looking for.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.780
And I think that origin of life chemistry

28:15.100 --> 28:20.100
is in danger of not making the progress that it deserves

28:20.740 --> 28:22.780
because the chemists are doing this.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.260
The field is exploding right now.

28:24.260 --> 28:25.980
There's amazing people out there.

28:26.860 --> 28:27.700
Young and old doing this.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.620
And there's deservedly so more money going in.

28:30.620 --> 28:32.940
I used to complain there's more money being spent

28:32.940 --> 28:34.820
searching for the Higgs boson that we know exists

28:34.820 --> 28:36.540
and the origin of life.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.140
Why is that?

28:38.140 --> 28:39.780
We understand the origin of life.

28:39.780 --> 28:42.180
We're gonna actually work out what life is.

28:42.180 --> 28:43.660
We're gonna be at a bound the likelihood

28:43.660 --> 28:45.700
of finding life elsewhere in the universe.

28:45.700 --> 28:48.620
And most important for us, we are gonna know

28:48.620 --> 28:50.700
or have a good idea of what the future of humanity

28:50.700 --> 28:51.900
looks like.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.980
We need to understand that although we're precious,

28:54.980 --> 28:57.140
we're not the only life forms in the universe.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.700
Well, that's my very strong impression.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.100
I have no data for that.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.180
It's just right now a belief.

29:02.180 --> 29:05.140
And I want to turn that belief into more than a belief

29:05.140 --> 29:07.180
by experimentation.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.340
But coming back to the scam, the scam is

29:10.340 --> 29:15.340
if we just make this RNA, we've got this fluke event,

29:16.020 --> 29:17.540
we know how that's simple.

29:17.540 --> 29:21.220
Let's make this phosphodiester or let's make ATP or ADP.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.420
We've got that part nailed.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.420
Let's now make this other molecule, another molecule.

29:24.420 --> 29:26.460
And how many molecules are gonna be enough?

29:26.460 --> 29:29.060
And then the reason I say this is when you go back

29:29.060 --> 29:33.660
to Craig Venter, when he invented his life form,

29:33.660 --> 29:38.660
Cyndia, this minimal plasma is a myoplasma,

29:41.620 --> 29:43.140
it's something I don't know the name of it,

29:43.140 --> 29:45.780
but he made this wonderful cell and said,

29:45.780 --> 29:49.180
I've invented life, not quite.

29:49.180 --> 29:52.660
He facsimile-ed the genome from this entity

29:52.660 --> 29:55.620
and made it in the lab or the DNA,

29:55.620 --> 29:56.940
but he didn't make the cell.

29:56.940 --> 30:00.940
He had to take an existing cell that has a causal chain

30:00.940 --> 30:02.660
going all the way back to Luca.

30:02.660 --> 30:06.180
And he showed when he took out the gene, the genes

30:06.180 --> 30:09.820
and put in his genes, synthesized, the cell could boot up.

30:09.820 --> 30:11.940
But it's remarkable that he could not make a cell

30:11.940 --> 30:12.900
from scratch.

30:12.900 --> 30:16.140
And even now today, synthetic biologists cannot make a cell

30:16.140 --> 30:20.340
from scratch because there's some contingent information

30:20.340 --> 30:23.820
embodied outside the genome in the cell.

30:23.820 --> 30:26.180
And that is just incredible.

30:26.180 --> 30:28.140
So there's lots of layers to the scam.

30:29.980 --> 30:32.980
Well, let me then ask the question,

30:32.980 --> 30:37.260
how can we create life in the lab from scratch?

30:37.260 --> 30:39.460
What have been the most promising attempts

30:39.460 --> 30:41.900
at creating life in the lab from scratch?

30:41.900 --> 30:44.260
Has anyone actually been able to do it?

30:44.260 --> 30:46.380
Do you think anyone will be able to do it

30:46.380 --> 30:48.580
in the near future if they haven't already?

30:49.420 --> 30:53.660
Um, yeah, I think that nobody has made life

30:53.660 --> 30:54.740
in the lab from scratch.

30:54.740 --> 30:57.380
Lots of people would argue that they have made progress.

30:57.380 --> 30:59.300
The Craig Venter, I think the synthesis

30:59.300 --> 31:03.580
of a synthetic genome milestone in human achievement.

31:03.580 --> 31:04.420
Brilliant.

31:04.420 --> 31:06.340
Yeah, can we just walk back and say,

31:06.340 --> 31:09.740
what would you say from your perspective,

31:09.740 --> 31:12.980
one of the world experts in exactly this area,

31:12.980 --> 31:15.100
what does it mean to create life from scratch?

31:15.100 --> 31:17.260
Where if you sit back, whether you do it

31:17.260 --> 31:19.180
or somebody else does it, it's like,

31:20.060 --> 31:24.580
damn, this is, we just created life.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.580
Well, what I would, I can tell you what I would expect,

31:27.580 --> 31:30.220
I would like to be able to do,

31:30.220 --> 31:35.220
is to go from sand to cells in my lab.

31:35.540 --> 31:36.380
And-

31:37.540 --> 31:39.060
Can you explain what sand is?

31:39.060 --> 31:40.980
Yeah, just inorganic, just inorganic stuff.

31:40.980 --> 31:45.820
Like basically just, so sand is just silicon oxide

31:45.820 --> 31:47.220
with some other ions in it,

31:48.180 --> 31:50.940
maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates,

31:50.940 --> 31:52.940
just basically clearly dead stuff

31:52.940 --> 31:55.540
that you could just grind rocks into sand.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.900
And it would be what, in a kind of vacuum

31:57.900 --> 32:00.660
so they could remove anything else that could possibly

32:01.940 --> 32:06.260
be like a shadow of life that can assist in the chemical-

32:06.260 --> 32:07.100
You could do that.

32:07.100 --> 32:08.940
You could insist and say, look, I'm gonna take,

32:08.940 --> 32:10.700
and not just inorganic, I want some more,

32:10.700 --> 32:12.540
I wanna cheat and have some organic,

32:12.540 --> 32:13.860
but I want inorganic organic,

32:13.860 --> 32:16.060
and I'll explain the play on words in a moment.

32:16.060 --> 32:19.380
So I would like to basically put into a world,

32:19.380 --> 32:22.740
let's say a completely synthetic world,

32:22.740 --> 32:24.460
if you like, a closed world,

32:24.460 --> 32:26.660
put some inorganic materials

32:26.660 --> 32:29.980
and just literally add some energy in some form,

32:29.980 --> 32:33.620
be it lightning or heat, UV light,

32:33.620 --> 32:37.140
and run this thing in cycles over time

32:37.140 --> 32:38.580
and let it solve the search problem.

32:38.580 --> 32:41.100
So I see the origin of life as a search problem

32:41.100 --> 32:42.660
in chemical space.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.540
And then I would wait, literally wait for a life form

32:45.580 --> 32:46.580
to crawl out of the test tube.

32:46.580 --> 32:48.100
That's a joke I tell my group.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.620
Literally wait for a very, don't worry,

32:51.620 --> 32:52.540
it's gonna be very feeble,

32:52.540 --> 32:54.700
it's not gonna take over the world.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.060
There's ways of ethically containing-

32:56.060 --> 32:57.220
Famous last words.

32:58.220 --> 33:00.220
Indeed, indeed, indeed.

33:00.220 --> 33:01.420
But I-

33:01.420 --> 33:03.260
You know this is being recorded, right?

33:03.260 --> 33:05.660
It'll make you, it will not make you look good

33:05.660 --> 33:07.660
once it crawls out of the lab

33:07.660 --> 33:09.940
and destroys all of human civilization, but yes.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.060
But there is very good,

33:11.060 --> 33:13.420
there's very good things you can do to prevent that.

33:13.420 --> 33:15.580
For instance, if you put stuff in your world,

33:15.580 --> 33:17.460
which isn't earth-abundant,

33:17.460 --> 33:20.420
so let's say we make life based on molybdenum

33:20.420 --> 33:21.940
and it escapes, it would die immediately

33:21.940 --> 33:23.460
because there's not enough molybdenum in the environment.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.700
So we can put in, we can do responsible life,

33:26.700 --> 33:29.900
or as I fantasized with my research group on our away day,

33:29.900 --> 33:31.500
they would go in, it's, you know,

33:31.500 --> 33:33.580
I think it's actually morally,

33:33.580 --> 33:38.020
if we don't find, until humanity finds life in the universe,

33:38.020 --> 33:39.260
this is going on a tangent,

33:39.260 --> 33:42.020
it's our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs,

33:42.020 --> 33:43.820
identify dead planets and bomb them

33:43.820 --> 33:46.580
with our origin of life machines and make them alive.

33:46.580 --> 33:49.700
I think it is our moral obligation to do that.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.780
I'm sure some people might argue with me about that,

33:51.780 --> 33:54.420
but I think that we need more life in the universe.

33:54.420 --> 33:58.980
And then we kind of forget, we did it and then come back.

33:58.980 --> 34:02.260
And they say, where did you come from?

34:02.260 --> 34:04.020
But coming back to the, what I'd expect.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.500
So I just say- Father, are you back?

34:06.500 --> 34:08.060
It's, I think this is once again,

34:08.060 --> 34:09.220
a Rick and Morty episode.

34:09.220 --> 34:11.940
It's definitely all Rick and Morty all the way down.

34:12.860 --> 34:15.580
So I imagine we have this pristine experiment

34:15.580 --> 34:18.140
and everything is, you know, sanitized

34:18.140 --> 34:21.980
and we put in inorganic materials and we have cycles

34:21.980 --> 34:24.540
with them, day, night cycles, up, down, whatever.

34:24.540 --> 34:27.300
And we look for evidence of replication

34:27.300 --> 34:28.820
and evolution over time.

34:28.820 --> 34:30.620
And that's what the experiment should be.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.500
Now, are there people doing this in the world right now?

34:32.500 --> 34:33.820
There are a couple of,

34:33.820 --> 34:35.820
there's some really good groups doing this.

34:35.820 --> 34:37.220
There's some really interesting scientists

34:37.220 --> 34:38.780
doing this around the world.

34:38.780 --> 34:43.780
They're kind of perhaps too much associated with the scam.

34:44.540 --> 34:48.500
So, and so they're using molecules

34:48.500 --> 34:50.900
that were already invented by biology.

34:50.900 --> 34:54.140
So there's a bit of replication built in,

34:54.140 --> 34:57.700
but I still think the work they're doing is amazing.

34:57.700 --> 35:00.220
But I would like people to be a bit freer and say,

35:00.220 --> 35:03.540
let's just basically shake a load of sand in a box

35:03.540 --> 35:04.580
and wait for life to come out

35:04.580 --> 35:06.340
because that's what happened on earth.

35:06.340 --> 35:08.020
And so we have to understand that.

35:08.020 --> 35:10.180
Now, how would I know I've been successful?

35:10.180 --> 35:11.940
Well, because I'm not obsessing

35:11.940 --> 35:15.100
with what molecules are in life now,

35:16.100 --> 35:19.860
I would wager a vast quantity of money.

35:19.860 --> 35:21.940
I'm not very rich, so it'd just be a few dollars.

35:21.940 --> 35:26.940
But for me, the solution space will be different.

35:27.220 --> 35:31.060
So the genetic material will be not RNA.

35:31.060 --> 35:33.620
The proteins will not be what we think.

35:33.620 --> 35:36.140
The solutions will be just completely different.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.780
And it might be, and it will be very feeble

35:37.780 --> 35:40.900
because that's the other thing we should be able to show

35:40.900 --> 35:43.820
fairly robustly that even if I did make

35:43.820 --> 35:46.060
or someone did make a new life form in the lab,

35:46.060 --> 35:50.060
it would be so poor that it's not gonna leap out.

35:50.060 --> 35:55.060
It is the fear about making a lethal life form

35:56.060 --> 36:00.660
in the lab from scratch is similar to us imagining

36:00.660 --> 36:02.660
that we're gonna make the Terminator,

36:02.660 --> 36:05.820
Boston Dynamics tomorrow, simply not.

36:05.860 --> 36:08.460
And the problem is we don't communicate that properly.

36:08.460 --> 36:12.860
I know you yourself, you explain this very well.

36:12.860 --> 36:14.980
There is not the AI catastrophe coming.

36:16.020 --> 36:16.980
We're very far away from that.

36:16.980 --> 36:18.420
That doesn't mean we should ignore it.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.020
Same with the origin of life catastrophe.

36:20.020 --> 36:21.900
It's not coming anytime soon.

36:21.900 --> 36:23.100
We shouldn't ignore it.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.340
But we shouldn't let that fear stop us

36:25.340 --> 36:26.540
from doing those experiments.

36:26.540 --> 36:28.500
But this is a much, much longer discussion

36:28.500 --> 36:29.860
because there's a lot of details there.

36:29.860 --> 36:33.620
I would say there is potential for catastrophic events

36:33.620 --> 36:37.020
to happen in much dumber ways.

36:37.020 --> 36:40.060
In AI space, there's a lot of ways to create,

36:40.060 --> 36:42.660
like social networks are creating

36:42.660 --> 36:46.300
a kind of accelerated set of events

36:46.300 --> 36:48.380
that we might not be able to control.

36:48.380 --> 36:53.260
The social network virality in the digital space

36:53.260 --> 36:57.660
can create mass movements of ideas

36:57.660 --> 37:00.340
that can then, if times are tough,

37:00.340 --> 37:02.980
create military conflict and all those kinds of things.

37:02.980 --> 37:05.660
But that's not super intelligent AI.

37:05.660 --> 37:09.740
That's an interesting, at scale, application of AI.

37:09.740 --> 37:13.300
If you look at viruses, viruses are pretty dumb.

37:13.300 --> 37:16.820
But at scale, their application is pretty detrimental.

37:16.820 --> 37:21.820
And so origin of life, much like all the kind of virology,

37:25.220 --> 37:27.220
the very contentious word

37:27.220 --> 37:29.300
of gain of function research in virology,

37:29.300 --> 37:31.740
sort of like research on viruses,

37:33.460 --> 37:36.140
messing with them genetically,

37:36.140 --> 37:39.020
that can create a lot of problems if not done well.

37:39.020 --> 37:41.860
So we have to be very cautious.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.300
So there's a kind of,

37:43.300 --> 37:47.140
whenever you're ultra cautious about stuff in AI

37:47.140 --> 37:50.780
or in virology and biology,

37:50.780 --> 37:53.460
it borders on cynicism, I would say,

37:53.460 --> 37:55.420
where it's like everything we do

37:55.420 --> 37:58.700
is going to turn out to be destructive and terrible.

37:58.700 --> 38:01.020
So I'm just going to sit here and do nothing.

38:01.020 --> 38:03.500
Okay, that's a possible solution,

38:03.500 --> 38:06.420
except for the fact that somebody's going to do it.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.540
Science and technology progresses.

38:10.540 --> 38:14.820
So we have to do it in an ethical way, in a good way,

38:14.820 --> 38:17.860
considering in a transparent way, in an open way,

38:19.020 --> 38:23.820
considering all the possible positive trajectories

38:23.820 --> 38:25.540
that could be taken and making sure

38:25.540 --> 38:28.300
as much as possible that we walk those trajectories.

38:28.300 --> 38:31.140
So yeah, I don't think Terminator is coming,

38:31.140 --> 38:35.260
but a totally unexpected version of Terminator

38:35.260 --> 38:36.380
may be around the corner.

38:36.380 --> 38:37.340
Yeah, it might be here already.

38:37.340 --> 38:39.020
Yeah, so I agree with that.

38:39.020 --> 38:41.500
And so going back to the origin of life discussion,

38:41.500 --> 38:44.540
I think that in synthetic biology right now,

38:44.540 --> 38:49.140
we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes

38:49.140 --> 38:51.500
and edit synthetic biology to do things.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.980
So that's kind of, that's where things might go wrong,

38:53.980 --> 38:56.340
in the same way as Twitter turning ourselves

38:56.340 --> 38:59.500
into kind of strange scale effects.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.820
I would love origin of life research

39:01.820 --> 39:04.620
or artificial life research to get to the point

39:04.620 --> 39:06.860
where we have those worries,

39:06.860 --> 39:07.700
because that's why I think

39:07.700 --> 39:08.900
we're just so far away from that.

39:08.900 --> 39:10.740
We are just, you know, right now,

39:10.740 --> 39:13.140
I think there are two really important angles.

39:13.140 --> 39:15.900
There is the origin of life people,

39:15.900 --> 39:18.820
researchers who are faithfully working on this

39:18.820 --> 39:20.580
and trying to make those molecules,

39:20.580 --> 39:22.780
the scan molecules I talk about.

39:22.780 --> 39:24.900
And then there are people on the creationist side

39:24.900 --> 39:26.980
just saying, look, the fact you can't make these molecules

39:26.980 --> 39:29.980
and you can't make a cell means that evolution isn't true

39:29.980 --> 39:30.820
and all this other stuff.

39:30.820 --> 39:31.660
Gotcha.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.220
Yeah, and so, and I find that really frustrating

39:34.220 --> 39:35.980
because actually the origin of life research

39:35.980 --> 39:37.860
is all working in good faith, right?

39:37.860 --> 39:38.700
Yes.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.900
And so what I'm trying to do is give origin of life research

39:41.900 --> 39:46.900
a little bit more of an open context.

39:47.220 --> 39:49.460
And one of the things I think is important,

39:49.460 --> 39:52.340
I really want to make a new life form in my lifetime.

39:52.340 --> 39:56.060
I really want to prove that life is a general phenomena,

39:56.060 --> 39:58.140
a bit like gravity in the universe,

39:58.140 --> 39:59.940
because I think that's gonna be really important

39:59.940 --> 40:04.940
for humanity's global psychological state meaning

40:05.460 --> 40:06.300
going forward.

40:06.300 --> 40:09.100
That's beautifully, that's beautifully put.

40:09.100 --> 40:12.500
So one, it will help us understand ourselves.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.220
So that's useful for science,

40:14.220 --> 40:17.660
but two, it gives us a kind of hope,

40:17.660 --> 40:22.660
if not an awe at all the huge amounts

40:24.020 --> 40:26.380
of alien civilizations that are out there.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.140
If you can build life and understand

40:29.140 --> 40:31.900
just how easy it is to build life,

40:31.900 --> 40:35.540
then that's just as good, if not much better

40:35.540 --> 40:38.260
than discovering life on another planet.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.100
Yeah.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.620
I mean, it's cheaper.

40:41.620 --> 40:44.460
It's much cheaper and much easier

40:44.460 --> 40:47.460
and probably much more conclusive

40:47.460 --> 40:50.020
because once you're able to create life,

40:50.020 --> 40:52.260
like you said, it's a search problem

40:52.260 --> 40:55.580
that there's probably a lot of different ways to do it.

40:55.580 --> 40:58.940
So once you create the, once you find the first solution,

40:58.940 --> 41:00.620
you probably have all the right methodology

41:00.620 --> 41:02.660
for finding all kinds of other solutions.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.860
Yeah, and wouldn't it be great if we could find a solution?

41:04.860 --> 41:07.580
I mean, it's probably a bit late for,

41:07.580 --> 41:09.060
I mean, I worry about climate change,

41:09.060 --> 41:10.660
but I'm not that worried about climate change.

41:10.660 --> 41:13.420
And I think one day you could think about,

41:13.420 --> 41:15.140
could we engineer a new type of life form

41:15.140 --> 41:17.900
that could basically, and I don't want to do this,

41:17.900 --> 41:19.460
so I don't think we should do this necessarily,

41:19.460 --> 41:21.180
but it's a good thought experiment

41:21.180 --> 41:23.620
that would perhaps take CO2 out of the atmosphere

41:23.620 --> 41:26.060
or an intermediate life form, so it's not quite alive.

41:26.060 --> 41:28.900
It's almost like an add-on that we can,

41:28.900 --> 41:32.660
a time-dependent add-on you could give

41:32.660 --> 41:37.060
to say cyanobacteria in the ocean or to maybe to wheat

41:37.060 --> 41:38.140
and say, right, we're just gonna,

41:38.140 --> 41:40.300
we're gonna fix a bit more CO2

41:40.300 --> 41:42.060
and we're gonna work out how much we need to fix

41:42.060 --> 41:44.580
to basically save the climate

41:44.580 --> 41:47.660
and we're gonna use evolutionary principles

41:47.660 --> 41:49.540
to basically get there.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.940
What worries me is that biology has had a few billion years

41:51.940 --> 41:56.700
to find a solution for CO2 fixation, hasn't really done,

41:56.700 --> 41:58.900
it's not, the solution isn't brilliant for our needs,

41:58.900 --> 42:00.780
but biology wasn't thinking about our needs,

42:00.780 --> 42:03.180
biology was thinking about biology's needs.

42:03.180 --> 42:06.700
But I think if we can do, as you say, make life in the lab,

42:06.700 --> 42:09.700
then suddenly we don't need to go to everywhere

42:09.700 --> 42:10.940
and conclusively prove it.

42:10.940 --> 42:12.420
I think we make life in the lab,

42:12.420 --> 42:14.300
we look at the extent of life in the solar system,

42:14.300 --> 42:16.460
how far did Earth life get?

42:16.460 --> 42:17.780
Probably we're all Martians,

42:17.780 --> 42:19.260
probably life got going on Mars,

42:19.260 --> 42:21.220
the chemistry on Mars seeded Earth,

42:21.220 --> 42:22.940
that might have been a legitimate way

42:22.940 --> 42:25.540
to kind of truncate the surface space.

42:25.540 --> 42:26.580
But in the outer solar system,

42:26.580 --> 42:28.340
we might have completely different life forms

42:28.340 --> 42:32.060
on Enceladus, on Europa and Titan

42:32.060 --> 42:33.380
and that would be a cool thing because-

42:33.380 --> 42:35.060
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute,

42:35.060 --> 42:36.380
wait a minute.

42:36.380 --> 42:40.340
Did you just say that you think in terms of likelihood,

42:40.340 --> 42:43.620
life started on Mars, like statistically speaking,

42:43.660 --> 42:45.900
life started on Mars and seeded Earth?

42:45.900 --> 42:48.380
It could be possible because life was like,

42:48.380 --> 42:51.020
so Mars was habitable for the type of life

42:51.020 --> 42:53.940
that we have right now, type of chemistry before Earth.

42:53.940 --> 42:57.060
So it seems to me that Mars got searching,

42:57.060 --> 42:58.980
doing chemistry, right?

42:58.980 --> 42:59.820
And-

42:59.820 --> 43:00.860
It started way before.

43:00.860 --> 43:03.060
Yeah, and so they had a few more replicators

43:03.060 --> 43:05.380
and some other stuff and if those replicators

43:05.380 --> 43:07.740
got ejected from Mars and landed on Earth,

43:07.740 --> 43:10.380
and Earth was like, I don't need to start again.

43:10.380 --> 43:11.620
Right.

43:11.620 --> 43:13.340
Thanks for that and then it just carried on.

43:13.860 --> 43:17.900
I'm not going, I think we will find evidence of life on Mars,

43:17.900 --> 43:21.220
either life we put there by mistake, contamination,

43:21.220 --> 43:24.540
or actually life, the earliest remnants of life

43:24.540 --> 43:26.060
and that would be really exciting,

43:26.060 --> 43:28.140
it's a really good reason to go there

43:28.140 --> 43:29.620
but I think it's more unlikely

43:29.620 --> 43:31.620
because of the gravitational situation in the solar system,

43:31.620 --> 43:33.700
if we find life in the outer solar system-

43:33.700 --> 43:35.900
Titan and all that, that would be its own thing.

43:35.900 --> 43:36.740
Exactly.

43:36.740 --> 43:37.980
Wow, that would be so cool.

43:37.980 --> 43:40.820
If we go to Mars and we find life that looks

43:40.820 --> 43:43.060
a hell of a lot similar to Earth life

43:43.740 --> 43:46.780
and then we go to Titan and all those weird moons

43:46.780 --> 43:49.060
with the ices and the volcanoes and all that kind of stuff

43:49.060 --> 43:52.500
and then we find there something that looks,

43:52.500 --> 43:54.860
I don't know, way weirder.

43:54.860 --> 43:55.700
Yeah.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.660
Some other, some non-RNA type of situation.

43:57.660 --> 43:59.580
Or we might find almost life,

43:59.580 --> 44:01.900
like in the pre-biodic chemical space

44:01.900 --> 44:03.660
and I think there are four types of exoplanets

44:03.660 --> 44:04.540
we can go look for, right?

44:04.540 --> 44:07.220
Because when JWST goes up and touch wood,

44:07.220 --> 44:09.500
it goes up and everything's fine.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.420
When we look at a star, well we know,

44:11.420 --> 44:13.460
statistically most stars have planets around them.

44:13.460 --> 44:14.700
What type of planet are they?

44:14.700 --> 44:16.420
Are they gonna be dead?

44:16.420 --> 44:20.660
Are they gonna be just a pre-biodic origin of life coming?

44:20.660 --> 44:23.420
So are they gonna be technological?

44:23.420 --> 44:25.140
And so with intelligence on them,

44:25.140 --> 44:27.300
and will they have died?

44:27.300 --> 44:30.620
So from, had life on them, but gone.

44:30.620 --> 44:31.460
Those are the four states of-

44:31.460 --> 44:33.260
The four, and so suddenly,

44:33.260 --> 44:34.980
it's a bit like I want to classify planets

44:34.980 --> 44:37.020
the way we classify stars.

44:37.020 --> 44:37.860
Yeah.

44:37.860 --> 44:40.740
And I think that in terms of rather than having this,

44:41.180 --> 44:43.500
we've found methane as evidence of life.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.300
We found oxygen as evidence of life.

44:45.300 --> 44:48.380
We found whatever molecule marker

44:48.380 --> 44:51.780
and start to then frame things a little bit more.

44:51.780 --> 44:54.020
As those four states, which by the way,

44:54.020 --> 44:55.140
you're just saying four,

44:55.140 --> 44:58.780
but there could be a before the dead.

44:58.780 --> 45:00.100
There could be other states

45:00.100 --> 45:02.140
that we humans can't even conceive of.

45:02.140 --> 45:04.580
Just pre-biotic, almost alive,

45:04.580 --> 45:06.260
got the possibility to come alive.

45:06.260 --> 45:07.100
I think-

45:07.100 --> 45:09.300
But there could be a post-technological.

45:09.300 --> 45:12.060
Whatever we think of as technology,

45:12.060 --> 45:16.860
that could be pre-conscious,

45:18.300 --> 45:20.580
where we all meld into one super intelligent,

45:20.580 --> 45:21.980
conscious, or some weird thing

45:21.980 --> 45:23.900
that naturally happens over time.

45:23.900 --> 45:24.740
Yeah, yeah.

45:24.740 --> 45:26.820
I mean, I think that all bets are on them.

45:26.820 --> 45:28.140
The metaverse.

45:28.140 --> 45:30.020
Yeah, we are.

45:30.020 --> 45:32.500
We join into a virtual metaverse

45:32.500 --> 45:35.380
and start creating, which is kind of an interesting idea,

45:35.380 --> 45:38.460
almost arbitrary number of copies of each other,

45:38.500 --> 45:40.100
much more quickly,

45:40.100 --> 45:42.140
to mess with different ideas in mind.

45:42.140 --> 45:45.700
I can create 1,000 copies of Lex,

45:45.700 --> 45:48.100
every possible version of Lex,

45:48.100 --> 45:49.700
and then just see,

45:49.700 --> 45:52.740
and then I just have them argue with each other

45:52.740 --> 45:56.380
until in the space of ideas and see who wins out.

45:56.380 --> 45:58.100
How could that possibly go wrong?

45:58.100 --> 46:01.660
But anyway, especially in this digital space,

46:01.660 --> 46:04.540
where you can start exploring with AIs mixed in,

46:04.540 --> 46:07.500
you can start engineering arbitrary intelligences.

46:07.540 --> 46:10.140
You can start playing in the space of ideas,

46:10.140 --> 46:11.580
which might move us into a world

46:11.580 --> 46:15.300
that looks very different than a biological world.

46:15.300 --> 46:17.660
Our current world, the technology,

46:17.660 --> 46:20.820
is still very much tied to our biology.

46:22.060 --> 46:23.580
We might move past that completely.

46:23.580 --> 46:24.420
Oh, definitely.

46:24.420 --> 46:25.420
We definitely will.

46:25.420 --> 46:26.260
We definitely will.

46:26.260 --> 46:27.380
Because that could be another phase then.

46:27.380 --> 46:28.220
Sure.

46:28.220 --> 46:29.060
Because then you...

46:29.060 --> 46:30.820
But I did say technological, so I think I agree with you.

46:30.820 --> 46:32.580
I think, so you can have, let's get this right.

46:32.580 --> 46:36.540
So dead world, no prospect of alive.

46:36.540 --> 46:40.940
Prebiotic world, life emerging, living, and technological.

46:40.940 --> 46:42.220
And you probably, and the dead one,

46:42.220 --> 46:43.060
you probably won't be able to tell

46:43.060 --> 46:46.060
between the dead never been alive and the dead one,

46:46.060 --> 46:48.060
maybe you've got some artifacts, and maybe there's five.

46:48.060 --> 46:50.460
There's probably not more than five.

46:50.460 --> 46:52.420
And I think the technological one

46:52.420 --> 46:56.380
could have life on it still, but it might just have exceeded.

46:56.380 --> 46:58.860
Because one way that life might survive on Earth

46:58.860 --> 47:01.820
is if we can work out how to deal with the coming,

47:01.820 --> 47:05.500
the real climate change that comes when the sun expands.

47:05.540 --> 47:07.340
There might be a way to survive that.

47:09.500 --> 47:11.780
But yeah, I think that we need to start thinking

47:11.780 --> 47:13.980
statistically when it comes to looking

47:13.980 --> 47:15.260
for life in the universe.

47:15.260 --> 47:20.260
Let me ask you then sort of statistically,

47:20.700 --> 47:23.900
how many alien civilizations are out there

47:23.900 --> 47:26.540
in those four phases that you're talking about?

47:26.540 --> 47:28.620
When you look up to the stars,

47:28.620 --> 47:30.860
and you're sipping on some wine,

47:30.860 --> 47:35.380
and talking to other people with British accents

47:36.260 --> 47:38.340
about something intelligent and intellectual, I'm sure,

47:39.860 --> 47:42.740
do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations

47:42.740 --> 47:45.700
looking back at us and wondering the same?

47:45.700 --> 47:48.540
My romantic view of the universe

47:48.540 --> 47:52.220
is really taking loans from my logical self.

47:52.220 --> 47:55.500
So what I'm saying is I have no idea.

47:55.500 --> 47:59.460
But having said that, there is no reason

47:59.460 --> 48:04.460
to suppose that life is as hard as we first thought it was.

48:04.820 --> 48:08.780
And so if we just take Earth as a marker,

48:08.780 --> 48:12.220
and if I think that life is a much more general phenomena

48:12.220 --> 48:13.300
than just our biology,

48:13.300 --> 48:16.700
then I think the universe is full of life.

48:16.700 --> 48:18.860
And the reason for the Fermi paradox

48:18.860 --> 48:22.220
is not that they're not out there,

48:22.220 --> 48:24.980
it's just that we can't interact with the other life forms

48:24.980 --> 48:27.020
because they're so different.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.980
And I'm not saying that they're necessarily like

48:28.980 --> 48:31.780
as depicted in Arrival or other, you know,

48:32.740 --> 48:35.140
I'm just saying that perhaps

48:36.540 --> 48:39.900
there are very few universal facts in the universe.

48:39.900 --> 48:44.900
And maybe that is not, it's quite hard,

48:45.060 --> 48:47.220
our technologies are quite divergent.

48:47.220 --> 48:49.540
And so I think that it's very hard to know

48:49.540 --> 48:51.420
how we're gonna interact with alien life.

48:51.420 --> 48:53.740
You think there's a lot of kinds of life that's possible.

48:53.740 --> 48:55.260
I guess that was the intuition.

48:55.260 --> 48:56.340
Yeah.

48:56.340 --> 49:01.340
You provided that the way biology itself

49:02.380 --> 49:04.620
but even this particular kinds of biology

49:04.620 --> 49:05.620
that we have on Earth

49:07.100 --> 49:11.540
is something that is just one sample

49:11.540 --> 49:16.540
of nearly infinite number of other possible complex,

49:16.820 --> 49:19.300
autonomous self-replicating type of things

49:19.300 --> 49:20.660
that could be possible.

49:20.660 --> 49:24.300
And so we're almost unable to see

49:24.300 --> 49:28.500
the alternative versions of us, huh.

49:28.500 --> 49:31.860
I mean, we'll still be able to detect them.

49:31.860 --> 49:33.860
We'll still be able to interact with them.

49:33.860 --> 49:36.820
We'll still be able to like which,

49:36.820 --> 49:39.260
what's exactly is lost in translation.

49:39.260 --> 49:41.300
Why can't we see them?

49:41.300 --> 49:42.740
Why can't we talk to them?

49:42.740 --> 49:46.100
Because I too have a sense,

49:47.820 --> 49:49.780
you put it way more poetically,

49:49.780 --> 49:54.780
but it seems both statistically

49:54.900 --> 49:58.620
and sort of romantically,

49:58.620 --> 50:02.060
it feels like the universe should be teaming with life,

50:02.060 --> 50:04.020
like super intelligent life.

50:04.980 --> 50:09.060
And I just, I sit there and the Fermi paradox

50:09.060 --> 50:12.900
is very, it's felt very distinctly by me

50:12.900 --> 50:15.780
when I look up at the stars because it's like,

50:15.780 --> 50:19.260
it's the same way I feel when I'm driving through New Jersey

50:19.260 --> 50:23.180
and listening to Bruce Springsteen and feel quite sad.

50:23.180 --> 50:25.060
It's like Lucy Kay talks about pulling off

50:25.060 --> 50:27.740
to the side of the road and just weeping a little bit.

50:27.740 --> 50:31.220
I'm almost like wondering like,

50:31.220 --> 50:33.820
hey, why aren't you talking to us?

50:33.820 --> 50:35.020
It feels lonely.

50:35.020 --> 50:38.300
It feels lonely because it feels like they're out there.

50:38.300 --> 50:40.140
I think that there are a number of answers to that.

50:40.140 --> 50:42.700
I think the Fermi paradox is perhaps based on

50:42.700 --> 50:47.300
the assumption that if life did emerge in the universe,

50:47.300 --> 50:49.220
it would be similar to our life

50:49.220 --> 50:50.980
and there's only one solution.

50:50.980 --> 50:52.860
And I think that what we've got to start to do

50:53.540 --> 50:56.180
is go out and look for selection detection

50:56.180 --> 50:58.380
rather than an evolution detection

50:58.380 --> 50:59.980
rather than life detection.

51:01.420 --> 51:03.460
And I think that once we start to do that,

51:03.460 --> 51:07.060
we might start to see really interesting things.

51:07.060 --> 51:09.220
And we haven't been doing this for very long.

51:10.220 --> 51:12.660
And we are living in an expanding universe

51:12.660 --> 51:15.740
so that makes the problem a little bit harder.

51:15.740 --> 51:18.020
Everybody's always leaving.

51:18.020 --> 51:18.860
But I'm-

51:18.860 --> 51:19.860
Distance-wise.

51:19.860 --> 51:22.900
I'm very optimistic that we will,

51:22.900 --> 51:23.740
well, I don't know.

51:23.740 --> 51:25.820
There are two movies that came out

51:25.820 --> 51:27.740
within six months of one another,

51:27.740 --> 51:30.220
Ad Astra and Cosmos.

51:30.220 --> 51:32.900
Ad Astra, they're very expensive blockbuster,

51:32.900 --> 51:35.900
with Brad Pitt in it and saying there is no life

51:35.900 --> 51:37.260
and it's all, we've got to,

51:37.260 --> 51:39.140
life on earth has more pressures than Cosmos,

51:39.140 --> 51:40.380
which is a UK production,

51:40.380 --> 51:42.940
which basically aliens came and visited earth one day

51:42.940 --> 51:45.180
and they were discovered in the UK, right?

51:45.180 --> 51:47.460
It was quite, it's a fun film.

51:48.420 --> 51:50.420
But I really loved those two films.

51:50.420 --> 51:53.540
And at the same time, those films,

51:53.540 --> 51:54.780
at the time those films are coming out,

51:54.780 --> 51:58.540
I was working on a paper, a life detection paper.

51:58.540 --> 52:02.020
And I felt it was so hard to publish this paper.

52:02.020 --> 52:03.700
And it was almost as depressed,

52:03.700 --> 52:06.500
I got so depressed trying to get this science out there

52:06.500 --> 52:11.300
that I felt the depression of the film in Ad Astra,

52:11.300 --> 52:14.700
like life is, there's no life elsewhere in the universe.

52:14.700 --> 52:17.420
And, but I'm incredibly optimistic

52:18.380 --> 52:19.340
that I think we will find life in the universe,

52:19.340 --> 52:21.060
firm evidence of life.

52:21.060 --> 52:22.460
And it will have to start on earth,

52:22.460 --> 52:24.380
making life on earth and surprising us.

52:24.380 --> 52:25.660
We have to surprise ourselves

52:25.660 --> 52:28.420
and make non-biological life on earth.

52:28.420 --> 52:31.420
And then people say, well, you made this life on earth,

52:31.420 --> 52:34.380
therefore you're part of the causal chain of that.

52:34.380 --> 52:35.580
And that might be true.

52:35.580 --> 52:38.940
But if I can show how I'm able to do it

52:38.940 --> 52:40.820
with very little cheating

52:40.820 --> 52:42.380
or very little information inputs,

52:42.380 --> 52:45.940
just creating like a model planet, some description,

52:45.980 --> 52:48.540
and watching life emerge,

52:48.540 --> 52:51.180
then I think that we will be even to persuade

52:51.180 --> 52:55.100
even the hardest critic that it's possible.

52:55.100 --> 52:57.700
Now, with regards to the Fermi paradox,

52:57.700 --> 53:01.420
I think that we might crush that with the JWST.

53:01.420 --> 53:03.180
It's basically, if I recall correctly,

53:03.180 --> 53:06.460
the mirror is about 10 times the size of the Hubble

53:06.460 --> 53:09.060
that we're gonna be able to do spectroscopy,

53:09.060 --> 53:11.780
look at colors of exoplanets, I think,

53:11.780 --> 53:13.780
not brilliantly, but we'll be able to start

53:13.780 --> 53:15.300
to classify them.

53:15.300 --> 53:18.900
And we'll start to get a real feel

53:18.900 --> 53:21.420
for what's going on in the universe on these exoplanets.

53:21.420 --> 53:25.260
Because it's only in the last few decades, I think,

53:25.260 --> 53:26.700
maybe even last decade,

53:26.700 --> 53:31.380
that we even came to recognize

53:31.380 --> 53:33.900
that exoplanets even are common.

53:33.900 --> 53:36.180
And I think that that gives us a lot of optimism

53:36.180 --> 53:38.700
that life is gonna be out there.

53:38.700 --> 53:40.580
But I think we have to start framing,

53:42.540 --> 53:44.060
we have to start preparing the fact

53:44.060 --> 53:46.900
that biology is only one solution.

53:46.900 --> 53:50.620
I can tell you with confidence that biology on Earth

53:50.620 --> 53:52.620
does not exist anywhere else in the universe.

53:52.620 --> 53:54.700
We are absolutely unique.

53:54.700 --> 53:56.860
Well, okay, I love the confidence,

53:56.860 --> 54:01.860
but where does that confidence come from?

54:02.380 --> 54:07.380
Chemistry, how many options does chemistry really have?

54:07.620 --> 54:08.860
Many, that's the point.

54:08.860 --> 54:09.740
And the thing is,

54:09.740 --> 54:12.900
this is where the origin of life scam comes in,

54:12.900 --> 54:16.220
is that people don't count the numbers.

54:16.220 --> 54:19.980
So if biology as you find on Earth is common everywhere,

54:19.980 --> 54:21.580
then there's something really weird going on

54:21.580 --> 54:23.940
that basically written in the quantum mechanics,

54:23.940 --> 54:24.900
there's some kind of,

54:24.900 --> 54:26.660
these bonds must form over these bonds

54:26.660 --> 54:28.260
and this catalyst must form over this catalyst

54:28.260 --> 54:30.140
when they're all quite equal.

54:30.140 --> 54:31.860
Life is contingent.

54:31.860 --> 54:33.780
The origin of life on Earth

54:33.780 --> 54:35.700
was contingent upon the chemistry available

54:35.700 --> 54:38.620
at the origin of life on Earth.

54:38.620 --> 54:43.380
So that means if we want to find other Earth-like worlds,

54:43.380 --> 54:45.100
we look for the same kind of rocky world,

54:45.100 --> 54:47.860
we might look in the same zone as Earth

54:47.860 --> 54:50.340
and we might expect reasonably

54:50.340 --> 54:53.820
to find biological-like stuff going on.

54:53.820 --> 54:55.540
That would be a reasonable hypothesis,

54:55.540 --> 54:57.380
but it won't be the same, it can't be.

54:57.380 --> 55:00.500
It's like saying, I don't believe in magic.

55:00.500 --> 55:02.500
That's why I'm sure.

55:02.500 --> 55:03.660
I just don't believe in magic.

55:03.660 --> 55:06.500
I believe in statistics and I can do experiments.

55:06.540 --> 55:08.460
And so I won't get the same,

55:08.460 --> 55:10.060
exactly the same sequence of events,

55:10.060 --> 55:11.500
I'll get something different.

55:11.500 --> 55:14.420
And so there is TikTok elsewhere in the universe,

55:14.420 --> 55:16.620
but it's not the same as our TikTok, right?

55:16.620 --> 55:17.900
That's what I mean.

55:17.900 --> 55:20.180
Which aspect of it is not the same?

55:20.180 --> 55:23.540
Well, I just think, so what is TikTok?

55:23.540 --> 55:26.860
TikTok is a social media where people upload videos,

55:26.860 --> 55:28.140
right, of silly videos.

55:28.140 --> 55:29.500
So I guess there might be-

55:29.500 --> 55:31.060
Well, there's humor, there's attention,

55:31.060 --> 55:33.140
there's ability to process,

55:33.140 --> 55:35.500
there's ability for intelligent organisms

55:35.500 --> 55:38.660
to collaborate on ideas and find humor in ideas

55:38.660 --> 55:41.900
and play with those ideas, make them viral memes.

55:43.780 --> 55:46.620
Humor seems to be kind of fundamental to the human experience.

55:46.620 --> 55:48.820
And I think that that's a really interesting question

55:48.820 --> 55:52.380
we can ask, is humor a fundamental thing in the universe?

55:52.380 --> 55:53.660
I think maybe it will be, right?

55:53.660 --> 55:56.820
In terms of, you think about in a game theoretic sense,

55:56.820 --> 56:00.460
humor, the emergence of humor serves a role

56:00.460 --> 56:01.660
in our game engine.

56:01.660 --> 56:04.820
And so if selection is fundamental in the universe,

56:04.980 --> 56:05.820
so is humor.

56:06.940 --> 56:10.300
Well, I actually don't know exactly

56:10.300 --> 56:12.580
what role humor serves.

56:12.580 --> 56:15.380
Maybe it's like, from a chemical perspective,

56:15.380 --> 56:20.380
it's like a catalyst for,

56:20.380 --> 56:21.540
I guess it serves several purposes.

56:21.540 --> 56:23.740
One is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet.

56:23.740 --> 56:25.500
That's modern humor.

56:25.500 --> 56:28.260
But humor is also a good way to deal

56:28.260 --> 56:30.820
with the difficulty of life.

56:30.820 --> 56:34.620
It's a kind of valve, release valve for suffering.

56:35.500 --> 56:39.140
Like, throughout human history, life has been really hard.

56:39.140 --> 56:41.220
And for the people that I have known in my life

56:41.220 --> 56:44.820
who've lived through some really difficult things,

56:44.820 --> 56:47.260
humor is part of how they deal with that.

56:47.260 --> 56:48.100
Yeah.

56:48.100 --> 56:49.380
Because it's usually dark humor.

56:49.380 --> 56:51.540
But yeah, it's interesting.

56:51.540 --> 56:56.060
I don't know exactly what's the more mathematically

56:56.060 --> 56:58.900
general way to formulate what the hell is humor.

56:59.580 --> 57:01.020
What humor does it serve?

57:01.020 --> 57:03.780
But I still, we're kind of joking here,

57:03.780 --> 57:08.780
but it's a counterintuitive idea to me

57:09.780 --> 57:14.620
to think that life elsewhere in the universe

57:14.620 --> 57:17.420
is very different than life on Earth.

57:17.420 --> 57:22.420
And also, like, all of each instantiation of life

57:23.380 --> 57:26.020
is likely very different from each other.

57:26.020 --> 57:26.860
Yeah.

57:27.220 --> 57:30.540
Maybe there's a few clusters of similar-like life,

57:30.540 --> 57:34.220
but it's much more likely is what you're saying.

57:34.220 --> 57:36.260
To me, it's a kind of novel thought.

57:36.260 --> 57:37.620
I'm not sure what to do with it.

57:37.620 --> 57:39.580
But you're saying that there's,

57:39.580 --> 57:43.300
it's more common to be a weird odd cast

57:43.300 --> 57:44.940
in the full spectrum of life

57:44.940 --> 57:48.220
than it is to be in some usual cluster.

57:48.220 --> 57:51.580
So every instantiation of a kind of chemistry

57:51.580 --> 57:53.500
that results in complexity that's autonomous

57:53.500 --> 57:56.940
of self-replicating however the hell you define life,

57:56.940 --> 57:59.780
that is going to be very different every time.

57:59.780 --> 58:00.620
I don't know.

58:01.460 --> 58:05.020
It feels like a selection is a fundamental

58:05.020 --> 58:08.020
kind of directed force in the universe.

58:08.020 --> 58:11.580
Won't selection result in a few pockets

58:11.580 --> 58:13.540
of interesting complexities?

58:13.540 --> 58:18.540
I mean, yeah, if we ran Earth over again,

58:20.020 --> 58:20.940
over and over and over,

58:20.940 --> 58:22.300
you're saying it's going to come up,

58:23.140 --> 58:26.020
there's not going to be elephants every time?

58:26.020 --> 58:27.500
Yeah, I don't think so.

58:27.500 --> 58:30.540
I think that there will be similarities.

58:30.540 --> 58:32.300
And I think we don't know enough

58:32.300 --> 58:36.540
about how selection is globally works.

58:37.900 --> 58:41.140
But it might be that the elephant,

58:41.140 --> 58:42.660
the emergence of elephants was wired

58:42.660 --> 58:44.420
into the history of Earth in some way,

58:44.420 --> 58:47.980
like the gravitational force, how evolution was going,

58:47.980 --> 58:49.380
Cambrian explosions, blah, blah, blah,

58:49.380 --> 58:50.780
the emergence of mammals.

58:50.780 --> 58:53.740
But I just don't know enough about the contingency,

58:53.740 --> 58:54.900
the variability.

58:54.900 --> 58:57.260
All I do know is you count the number of bits

58:57.260 --> 58:59.300
of information required to make an element,

58:59.300 --> 59:03.580
sorry, an elephant, and think about the causal chain

59:03.580 --> 59:05.700
that provide the lineage of elephants

59:05.700 --> 59:07.620
going all the way back to Luca,

59:07.620 --> 59:10.340
there's a huge scope for divergence.

59:10.340 --> 59:15.060
Yeah, but just like you said, with chemistry and selection,

59:16.180 --> 59:19.660
the things that result in self-replicating

59:20.940 --> 59:24.900
chemistry and self-replicating organisms,

59:26.580 --> 59:29.380
those are extremely unlikely, as you're saying,

59:30.580 --> 59:33.140
but once they're successful, they multiply.

59:33.140 --> 59:37.700
So it might be a tiny subset of all things

59:37.700 --> 59:40.100
that are possible in the universe, chemically speaking,

59:40.100 --> 59:41.820
it might be a very tiny subset

59:41.820 --> 59:44.660
is actually successful at creating elephants,

59:44.660 --> 59:48.180
or elephant-like, or slash human-like creatures.

59:48.180 --> 59:49.020
Well, there's two different questions.

59:49.020 --> 59:51.460
The first one, if we were to reset Earth

59:51.460 --> 59:52.740
and to start again.

59:52.740 --> 59:54.940
At the different phases, sorry to keep interrupting.

59:54.940 --> 59:56.900
Yeah, no, if we restart Earth and start again,

59:56.900 --> 59:58.620
say we could go back to the beginning

59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.940
and do the experiment or have a number of Earths,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.620
how similar would biology be?

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:06.460
I would say that there would be broad similarities,

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:09.140
but the emergence of mammals is not a given

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.500
unless we're gonna throw an asteroid at each planet

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:15.740
at each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happened.

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.980
Then there's the other thing about

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.460
when you go to another Earth-like planet elsewhere,

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.940
maybe there's a different ratio of particular elements,

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:27.300
maybe the bombardment at the beginning of the planet

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.460
was quicker or longer than Earth,

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.820
and I just don't have enough information there.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:37.740
What I do know is that the complexity of the story

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:42.340
of life on Earth gives us lots of scope for variation,

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:45.620
and I just don't think it's a reasonable mathematical

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.980
assumption to think that life on Earth

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.580
that happened again would be same as what we have now.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:55.700
Okay, but you've also extended that to say that we might,

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.420
as an explanation for the Fermi paradox,

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:02.700
that that means we're not able to interact with them,

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.940
or that's an explanation for why we haven't,

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:10.540
at scale, heard from aliens is they're different than us.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.500
We've only been looking for, say, 70, 80 years,

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.460
so I think that the reason we have not found aliens yet

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:20.020
is that we haven't worked out what life is.

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:23.980
No, but the aliens have worked that out, surely.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.380
Statistically speaking, there must be a large number

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.820
of aliens that are way ahead of us

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.540
on this whole life question,

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:37.340
unless there's something about this stage

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:40.940
of intellectual evolution that often quickly results

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.580
in nuclear war and destroys itself,

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:47.580
like the, there's something in this process

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:52.500
that eventually, I don't know, crystallizes the complexity

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.860
and it stops, either dies or stops developing,

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.180
but most likely they already figured it out,

01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.900
and why aren't they contacting us?

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.940
There's some grad student somewhere

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.540
wants to study a new green planet.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.500
Maybe they have, I mean, maybe, I mean, I don't,

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.140
I mean, I don't have a coherent answer

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.940
to your question other than to say

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:15.500
that if there are other aliens out there

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.600
and they're far more advanced,

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.900
they might be in contact with each other

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.500
and they might also, we might be at a point

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.620
where what I'm saying quite critically

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.860
is it takes two to talk, right?

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.100
So the aliens might be there,

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.220
but if we don't have the ability to recognize them

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.700
and talk to them, then the aliens aren't going

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.100
to want to talk to us,

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.580
and I think that's a critical point

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:42.180
that probably if that's a filter,

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.420
there needs to be an ability for one

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.740
to communicate with the other

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.240
and we need to know what life is before we do that.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.900
So we haven't qualified to even join their club

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:51.860
to have a talk.

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.820
Well, I think they still want to teach us how to talk, right?

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:59.820
But my worry is that, or I think they would want

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.660
to teach us how to talk like you do when you meet it.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:07.980
Like when you even meet, I was going to say child,

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.780
but that's a human species.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.400
I mean like an ant.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.700
You want to try to communicate with them

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:19.400
through whatever devices you can, given what an ant is like.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.900
I just, I worry mostly about that humans

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:25.060
are just too close-minded or don't have the right tools.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.240
No, I'm going to push back on this quite significantly.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.660
I would say because we don't understand what life is

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:32.420
and because we don't understand

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.220
how life emerged in the universe,

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:37.460
we don't understand the physics that gave rise to life yet.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.700
And that means our description, fundamental description,

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.940
I'm way out of my pay grade, even further out,

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.860
but I'll say it anyway, because I think it's a fun-

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.260
You don't get paid much anyway, as you said earlier.

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:50.980
So I would say that we,

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.940
because we don't understand the universe yet,

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:56.060
we do not understand how the universe spat out life

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.660
and we don't know what life is.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.780
And I think that until we understand that,

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.980
it is going to limit our ability to even,

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.060
we don't qualify to talk to the aliens.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.480
So I'm going to say that they might be there,

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.620
but we just, I'm not going to say that I believe

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:12.460
in inter-dimensional aliens being present in this room.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.820
Yeah, but I think you're just being self-critical,

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.460
like we don't qualify.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.380
I think the fact that we don't qualify qualifies us.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.060
We're interesting in our innocence.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:25.740
No, I'm saying that because we don't understand

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.740
causal chains and the way that information

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.360
is propagated in the universe,

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.200
and we don't understand what replication is yet,

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.160
and we don't understand how life emerged.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.760
I think that we would not recognize aliens

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.200
and if someone doesn't recognize you,

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.360
you wouldn't go and talk to it.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.720
You don't go and talk to ants.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.280
You don't go and talk to birds,

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.800
or maybe some birds you do, right?

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.200
Because you can, there's just enough cognition.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.120
So I'm saying because we don't have enough,

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:58.760
our cognitive abilities are not yet where they need to be,

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.200
we probably aren't even communicating with them.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.920
So you don't agree with the dating strategy

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.680
of playing hard to get?

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.520
Because us humans, that seems to attract us.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.280
Within a species, that's fine,

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.700
but I think we don't actually have abstraction.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.640
No, actually, I think in this talk, in this conversation,

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.960
you've helped me crystallize something

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.260
that I think has been troubling me for a long time

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.200
with the thermoparadox.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.880
I'm pretty sure that a reasonable avenue

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.520
is to say that you would not go and talk to your cat

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.200
about calculus, right?

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.320
But I would still pet it.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.320
Sure, but I'm not talking about petting a cat.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:37.200
The analogy is that the aliens are not going to talk to us

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.040
because we, and I'm using calculus as an analogy

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:44.320
for abstraction, because we lack the layer,

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.440
the fundamental layer of understanding what life is

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.320
and what the universe is in our reality,

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.880
that it would be so counterproductive

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:55.320
interacting with intelligent alien species

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.880
that it would cause more angst for human race.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.520
But they don't care, okay.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.080
They gotta be self-interested,

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.920
so they don't care about, is it interesting for them?

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:11.920
Maybe they, I mean, surely there's a way to pet the cat

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:19.720
in this analogy, because even if we lack

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.600
complete understanding, it must be a very frustrating

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.520
experience for other kinds of intelligence

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.120
to communicate with us, still there must be a way

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.480
to interact with us, like perturb the system

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.840
in interesting ways to see what these creatures do.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.040
We might actually find the answer, I mean, again,

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.280
out of my pay grade, in a simulation of Earth,

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.920
or let's say a simulation where we allow

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.200
an intelligent AI to emerge, right,

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.200
and that AI, we then give it the objective

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.000
is to be curious, interact with other intelligence

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.280
in its universe, and then we might find

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.440
the parameters required for that AI to work with us,

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.320
and I think you'll find if the AI will not talk

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.800
to other AIs that don't share the ability

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.400
to abstract to the level of the AI,

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:13.280
because it's just a cat, and are you gonna travel

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.320
20 light years to go and pet a cat?

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.200
So not because of the inability to do so,

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.200
but because of boredom, it's more interesting,

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.120
it will start talking to, it will spend most,

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:28.960
it will spend a majority of its time talking

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.560
to other AI systems that can at least

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.240
somewhat understand it, it's much more fun.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.960
It's a bit like, do we know that plants are conscious?

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.240
Well, plants aren't conscious in the way

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.800
we typically think, but we don't talk to them,

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.640
they could be, right?

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.080
Yeah, but there's a lot of people on Earth

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.400
who like gardening, there's always going to be a weird-

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.160
They're not talking, they're just gardening.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.240
Okay, well, you're not romantic enough

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.120
to see gardening as a way of communication

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:48.960
between humans and plants.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.320
Oh, okay, you got me there.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.120
But there is ways, there's always going to be

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:55.640
the people who are curious, Jane Goodall,

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.560
who lives with the chimps, right?

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.880
There's always going to be curious intelligent species

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:05.880
that visit the weird Earth planet and try to interact.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.360
I mean, it's, yeah, I think it's a super cool idea

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.000
that you're expressing, I just kind of have a sense,

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.160
maybe it's a hope that there's always going to be

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.400
a desire to interact, even with those that don't,

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.000
can't possibly understand the depth of what you understand.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.680
So I'm with you, so I want to be as positive as you

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:29.360
that aliens do exist and we will interact with them.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.400
What I'm trying to do is to give you a reasonable hypothesis

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:37.560
why we haven't yet, and also something to strive for,

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.880
to be able to do that.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.760
I mean, you know, there is the other view

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:46.080
that the universe is just too big and life is just too rare,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.360
but I want to come up with an alternative explanation,

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.160
which I think is reasonable,

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.720
and not being philosophically and scientifically thought out,

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.920
which is this, if you can't actually communicate

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.760
with the object, the thing, competently,

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.240
you don't even know it's there, then there's no point yet.

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.520
See, I disagree with that, but I'm totally aligned

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.120
with your hopeful vision, which is like,

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.600
we need to understand the origin of life.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.520
It will help us engineer life,

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:15.160
it will help us engineer intelligent life

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.560
through perhaps on the computer side, through simulation,

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.920
and explore all the ways that life emerges,

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.120
and that will allow us to, I think the fundamental reason

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.160
we don't see overwhelming amounts of life

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:31.560
is I actually believe aliens, of course,

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:35.760
these are all just kind of open-minded beliefs.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.960
It's difficult to know for sure about any of this,

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.920
but I think there's a lot of alien civilizations

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.000
which are actively communicating with us,

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.480
and we're too dumb.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.720
We don't have the right tools to see it.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.560
That's what I'm saying.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.840
No, but maybe I misinterpreted you,

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:56.240
but I interpreted you to say they kind of tried a few times,

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.520
and they're like, oh, God.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.680
No, no, no, what I'm saying is, so this goes two ways.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.760
Yeah, I agree with you.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.840
There could be information out there,

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:04.960
but just put it in such a way

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.600
that we just don't understand it yet.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.440
Right.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.240
So sorry if I didn't make that clear.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.080
I mean, it's not just, I don't think we,

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.600
I think we qualify as soon as we can decode their signal.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.880
Right, so when you say qualify, got it, got it.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.680
So you mean we're just not smart enough.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.320
The word qualify was throwing me off.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.560
So we're not smart enough to do,

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.240
it's like, but we just need to get smarter.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.440
And there's a lot of people who believe,

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.640
let me get your opinion on this, about UFO sightings.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.640
So sightings of weird phenomena,

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.240
that, you know, what does UFO mean?

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.640
It means it's a flying object,

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:48.640
and it's not identified clearly at the time of sighting.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.560
That's what UFO means.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.440
So it could be a physics phenomena,

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.280
it could be ball lightning,

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:55.160
it could be all kinds of fascinating.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.600
I was always fascinated with ball lightning as a,

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.840
like the fact that there could be physical phenomena

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.040
in this world that are observable by the human eye.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.840
Of course, all physical phenomena generally are fascinating

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.840
that are, that really smart people can't explain.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.160
I love that, because it's like, wait a minute,

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.080
especially if you can replicate it,

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.680
it's like, wait a minute, how does this happen?

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.200
That's like the precursor to giant discoveries

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.520
in chemistry and biology and physics and so on.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.120
But it sucks when those events are super rare, right?

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:32.560
Physical, like leg ball lightning, so that's out there.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.720
And then, of course, that phenomena

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.480
could have other interpretations that don't have to do

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:40.400
with the physics and chemistry of the biology of Earth.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.080
It could have to do with more extraterrestrial explanations

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:48.800
that, in large part, thanks to Hollywood and movies

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.960
and all those kinds of things,

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.560
captivates the imaginations of millions of people.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.800
But just because it's science fiction

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.600
that captivates the imagination of people

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.000
doesn't mean that some of those sightings

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.480
all it takes is one.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.480
One of those sightings is actually a sign

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.240
that it's extraterrestrial intelligence,

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.240
that it's an object that's not of this particular world.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.360
Do you think there's a chance that that's the case?

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.520
What do you make, especially the pilot sightings,

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.760
what do you make of those?

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.160
So I agree that there's a chance, there's always a chance.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.600
Any good scientist would have to, or observationist

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.240
would have to, I think,

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.160
or observationist would have to,

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.120
I want to see if aliens exist, come to Earth.

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.440
What I know about the universe is I think it's unlikely

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.200
right now that there are aliens visiting us,

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.480
but not impossible.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:48.520
I think the releases, the dramatization

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.840
that's been happening politically,

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.600
saying we're gonna release all this information,

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.560
this classified information,

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.320
I was kind of disappointed because it was just

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.000
very poor material.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And right now, the ability to capture high resolution video,

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.440
everybody is carrying around with them

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.240
an incredible video device now,

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.240
and we haven't got more compelling data.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.640
And so that we've just seen grainy pictures,

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.400
a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.240
and whatnot.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.640
And so I think on balance, I think it's extremely unlikely,

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.280
but I think something really interesting is happening.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.400
And also during the pandemic, right?

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.480
We've all been locked down.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.120
We all want to have, our imaginations are running riot.

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.040
And I think that, I don't think that the information

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.400
out there has convinced me there are anything interesting

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.680
on the UFO side.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.760
But what it has made me very interested about

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.840
is how humanity is opening up its mind

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.840
to ponder aliens and the mystery of our universe.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.760
And so I don't want to dissuade people

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.480
from having those thoughts and say you're stupid

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.160
and look at that, it's clearly incorrect.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.840
That's not right, that's not fair.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.920
What I would say is that I lack sufficient data,

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:14.120
replicated observations to make me go,

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.640
oh, I'm gonna take this seriously.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.280
But I'm really interested by the fact

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.640
that there is this great deal of interest.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.440
And I think that it drives me to maybe want

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.640
to make an artificial life form even more

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.560
and to help NASA and the Air Force

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.320
and whoever go and look for things even more,

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.160
because I think humanity wants to know what's out there.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.240
There's this yearning, isn't there?

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:41.120
Yeah, but I see, I almost,

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.480
depending on the day, I sometimes agree with you,

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.880
but with the thing you just said,

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.720
but one of the disappointing things to me

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.040
about the sightings, I still hold the belief

01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:00.160
that a non-zero number of them

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.040
is an indication of something very interesting.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.840
So I don't side with the people who say

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.760
everything can be explained with sensor artifacts

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.600
kind of thing.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.200
Yeah, I agree with you, I didn't say that either.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.000
I would say I just don't have enough data.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.600
But the thing I want to push back on

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.320
is the statement that everybody

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.440
has a high definition camera.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.960
One of the disappointing things to me

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.000
about the report that the government released,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.400
but in general, just having worked with government,

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.840
having worked with people all over,

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:36.240
is how incompetent we are.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.800
Like if you look at the response to the pandemic,

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.240
how incompetent we are in the face of great challenges

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.080
without great leadership.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.920
How incompetent we are in the face

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.400
of the great mysteries before us

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.840
without great leadership.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.040
And I just think it's actually,

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.040
the fact that there's a lot of high definition cameras

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.280
is not enough to capture the full richness

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.920
of weird, of the mysterious phenomena out there

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.440
of which extraterrestrial intelligence

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.120
visiting earth could be one.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.440
I don't think we have,

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.080
I don't think everybody having a smartphone

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.920
in their pocket is enough.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.480
I think that allows for TikTok videos.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.920
I don't think it allows for the capture

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.840
of even interesting, relatively rare human events.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.440
That's not that common.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.600
It's rare to be in the right moment

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.600
in the right time to be able to capture the thing.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.520
I agree, I agree.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.960
Let me rephrase what I think on this.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.760
I haven't seen enough information.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.840
I haven't really actively sought it out, I must admit.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.440
But I'm with you in that I love the idea

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.880
of anomaly detection in chemistry in particular.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.800
I want to make anomalies, sorry,

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:47.720
or not necessarily make anomalies.

01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:50.760
I want to understand an anomaly.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.560
Let me give you two from chemistry,

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.640
which are really quite interesting.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.280
Phlogiston, going way back,

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.080
where people said there's this thing called phlogiston.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.320
And for ages, the alchemists got really this kind of,

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.920
the fire is the thing.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.320
That's one, and then we determined

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.360
that phlogiston wasn't what we thought it is.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.320
Let's go to physics, the ether.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.480
The ether's a hard one,

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.480
because I think actually the ether might exist,

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.040
and I'll tell you what I think the ether is later.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.560
Can you explain ether?

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.440
As the vacuums, the light traveling

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.680
through the ether in the vacuum.

01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:31.040
There is some thing that we call the ether

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.560
that basically mediates the movement of light.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:38.280
And then the other one is cold fusion,

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.360
which is more of a, so a few years ago,

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:44.320
that people observed it when they did some electrochemistry,

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:48.280
when they were splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen,

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.640
that you got more energy out than you put in.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.880
And people got excited,

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.680
and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.960
And in the end, it was kind of discredited,

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.920
because you didn't detect neutrons and all that stuff.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.680
But I'm pretty sure, I'm a chemist,

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.160
I'm telling you this on your podcast, but why not?

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.400
I'm pretty sure there's interesting

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.400
electrochemical phenomena

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.920
that's not completely bottomed out yet,

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.440
that there is something there.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.960
However, we lack the technology and the experimental design.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.240
So what I'm saying in your response about aliens

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.400
is we lack the experimental design

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.480
to really capture these anomalies.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.760
And we are encircling the planet

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.360
with many more detection systems.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:29.000
We've got satellites everywhere.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.720
So there is, I do hope that we are gonna discover

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:32.560
more anomalies.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.560
And remember that the solar system isn't just static

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.160
in space, it's moving through the universe.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.720
So there's just more and more chance.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.920
I'm not what with Avi Loeb,

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:46.800
that he's generating all sorts of kind of a cult,

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.000
I would say, with this.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.520
But I'm not against him.

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.040
I think there is a finite chance,

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.200
if there are aliens in the universe,

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.800
that we're gonna happen upon them,

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.280
because we're moving through the universe.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.760
What's the nature of the following that Avi Loeb has?

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.240
He's doubling down more and more and more

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.240
and say there are aliens, interdimensional aliens

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.440
and everything else, right?

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.840
He's gone from space junk accelerating out of

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.560
to interdimensional stuff in a very short space of time.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.800
I see.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.840
He's obviously bored.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.720
Or he wants to tap into the psyche and understand.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.160
And he's playfully kind of trying to interact

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.880
with society and his peers to say,

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.560
stop saying it's not possible.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.520
Which I agree with, we shouldn't do that.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.640
But we should frame it statistically

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.800
in the same way we should frame everything

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.920
as good scientists, statistically.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.240
Yeah, good scientists.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.520
Recently, the idea of good scientists is,

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.720
I take quite skeptically.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.360
I've been listening to a lot of scientists

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.600
tell me about what is good science.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.400
That makes me sad, because you've been interviewed,

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.640
what I would consider a lot of really good scientists.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.000
No, that's true.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.920
But that's exactly right.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.480
And most of the people I talk to are incredible human beings.

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.880
But there's a humility that's required.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:10.040
Science is not, science cannot be dogmatism.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.480
Sure, I agree, I mean.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.480
Authority, a PhD does not give you authority.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:19.560
A lifelong pursuit of a particular task

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:21.040
does not give you authority.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:24.040
You're just as lost and clueless as everybody else,

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.320
but you're more curious and more stubborn.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.960
So that's a nice quality to have.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:34.960
But overall, just using the word science

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:40.680
and statistics can often, as you know,

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.200
kind of become a catalyst for dismissing new ideas,

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.440
out of the box ideas, wild ideas, all that kind of stuff.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.240
Well, yes and no.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.600
I think that, so I like to,

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.760
some people find me extremely annoying in science

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.160
because I'm basically, I'm quite rude and disruptive,

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.640
not in a rude, you know,

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.240
some people say they're ugly or stupid or anything like that.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:13.240
I just say, you're wrong, or why do you think this?

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.920
And something, a gift I got given by society

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:17.760
when I was very young,

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:20.680
because I was in the learning difficulties class at school

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.800
is I was told I was stupid.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.920
And so I know I'm stupid,

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:27.640
but I always wanted to be smart, right?

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:29.080
I remember going to school going,

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.600
maybe today they're gonna tell me

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.400
I'm not as stupid as I was yesterday.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.520
And I was always disappointed, always.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.680
And so when I went into academia and everyone said,

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.200
you're wrong, I was like, join the queue.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.480
Because it allowed me to walk through the wall.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:46.240
So I think that people like to always imagine science

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.160
is a bit like living in a Japanese house,

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.040
the paper walls, and everyone sits in their room.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.000
And I annoy people because I walk straight through the wall,

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.080
because why should I be a chemist and not a mathematician?

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.440
Why should I be a mathematician and not a computer scientist?

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.360
Because if the problem requires us

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.080
to walk through those walls,

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.440
but I like walking through the walls,

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.480
but then I have to put up,

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:12.480
I have to do good science,

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.080
I have to win the people in those rooms across

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.520
by good science, by taking their criticisms

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.040
and addressing them head on.

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.480
And I think we must do that.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.280
And I think that I try and do that in my own way.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.120
And I kind of love walking through the walls.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.240
And it gives me, it's difficult for me personally,

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.120
it's quite painful,

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.320
but it always leads to a deeper understanding

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.400
of the people I'm with.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.080
In particular, the arguments I have

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.440
with all sorts of interesting minds,

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.840
because I want to solve the problem,

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.400
or I want to understand more about why I exist.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.680
That's it, really.

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.800
And I think we have to not dismiss science on that basis.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.280
I think we can work with science.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:02.040
No, science is beautiful, but humans with egos

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.200
and all those kinds of things

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:08.200
can sometimes misuse good things,

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.720
like social justice,

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.240
like all ideas we all aspire to misuse

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:18.720
these beautiful ideas to manipulate people,

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.120
to all those kinds of things.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:20.960
Sure.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:25.520
There's assholes in every space and walk of life,

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:28.840
including science, and those are no good.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:29.840
But yes, you're right.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:34.640
The scientific method has proven to be quite useful.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.560
That said, for difficult questions,

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:41.560
for difficult explanations for rare phenomena,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.840
you have to walk cautiously.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:50.240
Because the scientific method,

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.280
when you totally don't understand something,

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.520
and it's rare, and you can't replicate it,

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.160
doesn't quite apply.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.320
I agree with you.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:02.160
The challenge is to not dismiss the anomaly

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.600
because you can't replicate it.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.280
I mean, we can talk about this.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:06.560
This is something I realized

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.600
when we were developing assembly theory.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.000
People thinking that the track they're on

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.480
is so dogmatic, but there is this thing

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:19.120
that they see, but they don't see.

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.280
It takes a bit of time,

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.360
and you just have to keep reframing it.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.040
My approach is to say, well, why can't this be right?

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.480
Why must we accept that RNA is the only way into life?

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:31.240
I mean, who says?

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:35.800
Does RNA have a special class of information

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.160
that's encoded in the universe?

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.600
No, of course it doesn't.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:41.080
RNA is not a special molecule

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.840
in the space of all the other molecules.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.520
But it's so elegant and simple,

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.680
and it works so well for the evolutionary process

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.120
that we kind of use that as an intuition to explain

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.440
that that must be the only way to have life.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:52.280
Sure.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.160
But you mentioned assembly theory.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.120
Well, first, let me pause.

01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:57.680
Bathroom break, needed?

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.880
Yeah, let's take two minutes.

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.480
We took a quick break, and offline,

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:07.400
you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home,

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.640
and then I said that you're basically Rick

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.920
from Rick and Morty, which is something

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.200
I've been thinking this whole conversation,

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:19.120
and then you say that there's a glowing pickle

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.600
that you used, something involving cold plasma, I believe.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:24.880
I don't know, but can you explain

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.320
the glowing pickle situation?

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.120
And is there many, arbitrarily many versions

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:37.400
of you in alternate dimensions that you're aware of?

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:42.200
I tried to make an electrochemical memory at home

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:47.200
using a pickle, and the only way I could get any traction

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.160
with it was actually by plugging it

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.640
into a very high-voltage alternating current

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:53.880
and then putting in a couple of electrodes,

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.000
but my kids weren't impressed.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.600
They're not impressed with anything I do,

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.920
any experiments I do at home.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.920
I think it's quite funny.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.360
But you connected a pickle to an electrode, I mean, you-

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:03.520
240 volts, yeah, AC,

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.880
and then had a couple of electrodes on it.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.280
So what happens is a pickle,

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.840
this is a classic thing you do.

01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.520
I mean, I shouldn't, pranks you do.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.200
You put a pickle into the mains

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.200
and just run away and leave it.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.640
And what happens is it starts to decompose.

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.080
It heats up and then explodes

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.000
because the water turns to steam

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.760
and it just violently explodes.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.800
But I wondered if I could cause the iron sodium

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.440
potassium ions in the pickle to migrate.

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.800
It'd been in a jar, right?

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.160
So it'd been in a brine.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:34.360
That was, yeah, that was not my best experiment.

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:35.960
So I've been doing far better experiments

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:37.000
in my lab at home.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.560
At that time it was a failed experiment,

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.680
but you never know.

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.600
It could, every experiment is a successful experiment

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.040
if you stick with it long enough.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.280
Well, I mean, I got kicked out of my own lab

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.880
by my research team many years ago and for good reason.

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.960
I mean, my team is brilliant

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.880
and I used to go and just break things.

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.240
So what I do do at home is I have a kind

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.240
of electronics workshop and I prototype experiments there.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.280
Then I try and suggest to my team sometimes,

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.240
maybe we can try this thing.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.520
And they would just say, oh, wow, that's not gonna work

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:10.360
because of this.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.080
And I'll say, aha, but actually I've tried

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.160
and here's some code and here's some hardware.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.280
Can we have a go?

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.520
So I'm doing that less and less now

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:20.800
as I get even more busy, but that's quite fun

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.240
because they feel that we're in the experiment together.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.640
You do in fact brilliantly, just like Rick

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:33.640
from Rick and Morty, connect chemistry with computation.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:39.360
So sort of, and when we say chemistry,

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.160
we don't mean the simulation of chemistry

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.920
or modeling of chemistry.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:49.240
We mean chemistry in the physical space

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.200
as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.240
We'll talk about that.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.040
But first you mentioned assembly theory.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:28:00.760
So we'll stick on theory in these big ideas.

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.000
I would say revolutionary ideas.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.280
This intersection between mathematics and philosophy.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.120
What is assembly theory?

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.680
And generally speaking, how would we recognize life

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.280
if we saw it?

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.880
So assembly theory is a theory, goes back a few years now

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.080
and my struggle for maybe almost 10 years

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.360
when I was going to origin of life conferences

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.240
and artificial life conferences where I thought

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.280
that everybody was dancing around the problem

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.720
of what life is and what it does.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.440
But I'll tell you about what assembly theory is

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:35.840
because I think it's easier.

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.280
So assembly theory literally says, if you take an object,

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.680
any given object, and you are able to break the object

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.400
into parts very gently, so just maybe let's say

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.000
take a piece of very intricate Chinese porcelain

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.240
and you tap it just with a hammer or the nail at some point

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.000
and it will fragment into many parts.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.880
And if that object is able to fragment into many

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:00.520
and you count those parts, the different parts,

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.600
so they're unsymmetrical.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:07.240
Assembly theory says the larger the number of parts,

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:10.200
unsymmetrical parts that object has,

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.520
the more likely it is that object has been created

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.080
by an evolutionary or information process,

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:19.000
especially if that object is not one-off,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.160
you've got an abundance of them.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.360
And that's really important.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.880
So because what I'm literally saying about the abundance,

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.320
if you have a one-off object and you break it into parts

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.480
and it has lots of parts, you'd say, well,

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.040
that could be incredibly intricate and complex,

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.960
but it could be just random.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:41.720
And I was troubled with this for years

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.680
because I saw in reality that assembly theory works.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.160
But when I talked to very good

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.680
computational complexity computation lists,

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.280
algorithmic complexity people, they said,

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.840
you haven't really done this properly,

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.800
you haven't thought about it.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.680
It's like, this is the random problem.

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:00.000
And so I kept working this up

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.160
because I invented an assembly theory in chemistry,

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.120
first of all, with molecules.

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:06.880
And so the thought experiment was,

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:11.520
how complex does a molecule need to be when I find it

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.520
that it couldn't possibly have risen by chance

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.240
probabilistically.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.320
And if I found this molecule able to detect

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:18.960
enough quantities in the same object,

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.840
like a machine, like a mass spectrometer.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.520
So typically in a mass spectrometer,

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.360
you weigh the molecules in electric field,

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.640
you probably have to have all the order

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:28.520
of 10,000 identical molecules to get a signal.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:32.880
So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.680
What's the chance of them occurring by chance?

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:37.520
Well, we can do the math.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.920
Let's take a molecule like strychnine or,

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.040
yeah, so strychnine is a good molecule actually to take.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.800
Or Viagra is a good molecule.

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.600
I made jokes about Viagra because it's complex molecule.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.440
And one of my friends said,

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.360
yeah, if we find Viagra on Mars in detectable quantities,

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.120
we know something is up.

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:55.960
Yeah.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:00.280
But anyway, it's a complex molecule.

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.720
So what you do is you take this molecule

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.800
in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.240
or in electric field and it breaks apart.

01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.960
And if the larger the number of different parts,

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.800
you know, when it starts to get to a threshold,

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.040
my idea was that that molecule could not be created

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.200
by chance probabilistically.

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:20.280
So that was where assembly theory was born

01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:22.800
in an experiment, in a mass spec experiment.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.360
And I was thinking about this

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:28.120
because NASA sending mass spectrometers to Mars, to Titan,

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.640
it's going to send them to Europa.

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:32.000
There's going to be a nuclear powered mass spectrometer

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.600
going to Titan.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.880
I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever.

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:37.280
They're not only sending a drone

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.440
that's going to fly around Titan,

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:42.560
it's going to be powered by a nuclear slug,

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:43.840
a nuclear battery,

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.920
and it's going to have a mass spectrometer on it.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.160
Is this already launched?

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.160
No, it's Dragonfly and it's going to be launched

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.000
in a few years.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.440
I think it got pushed a year because of the pandemic.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.200
So I think three or four years.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:59.280
Dragonfly, nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly to Titan

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:05.920
and collect data about the composition

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.600
of the various chemicals on Titan.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.360
Yeah, I'm trying to convince NASA.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.640
I don't know if I'll be able to convince

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.000
the Dragonfly team that they should apply this approach,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.040
but they will get data

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.840
and depending on how good their mass spectrometer is.

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:22.360
But I had this thought experiment anyway,

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:24.360
and I did this thought experiment.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.120
And for me, it seemed to work.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.080
I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.040
in assembly theory.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.600
And I basically, assembly theory,

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.760
if I take, let's just make it generic

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.200
and let's just take the word abracadabra.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.920
So can I, if you find the word,

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.160
so if you have a book with lots of words in it

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.800
and you find abracadabra one-off

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.520
and there's a rap book that's being written by,

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:48.440
in a random way, you know, set of monkeys in a room

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.480
and you know, and you un-typewriters

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:52.480
and you find one-off abracadabra, no big deal.

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:55.880
But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra,

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.480
well, that means something weird is going on.

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.440
But let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.280
So abracadabra has a, you know,

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.840
has a number of letters in it.

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:05.680
You can break it down.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.520
So you just cut the letters up.

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:09.640
But when you actually reassemble abracadabra,

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.440
the minimum number of ways of organizing those letters.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.360
So you'd have an A, a B, you know, and keep going up.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.880
There's just the, you can,

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.560
when you cut abracadabra up into parts,

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.080
you can put it together again in seven steps.

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:24.920
So what does that mean?

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:27.040
That means if you basically don't,

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.920
you're allowed to reuse things you make

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.560
in a chain at the beginning,

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.520
that's the memory of the universe,

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.040
the process that makes abracadabra.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.480
And because of that causal chain,

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.480
you can then get to abracadabra

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:40.440
quicker than the number of letters

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:43.200
for having to specify only in seven.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.640
So if you take that to a molecule

01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.920
and you cut the molecule up into parts

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.800
and you can, on the causal chain,

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:52.600
and you basically start with the atoms and then bonds,

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.520
and then you randomly add on those parts

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.360
to make the A, make the B, make the,

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.720
and keep going all the way up,

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.600
I found that literally, assembly theory

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.920
allows me to say how compressed a molecule is.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.840
So when there's some information in there.

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:09.640
And I realized assembly theory

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.280
isn't just confined to molecular space.

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:14.160
It can apply to anything.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.000
But let me finish the molecular argument.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.680
So what I did is I had this theory.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.680
I, with one of my students, we wrote an algorithm.

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:26.320
We basically took the 20 million molecules from the database

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.720
and we just calculate their assembly number.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:29.600
And that's the index.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.040
Like basically, if I take a molecule

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:33.920
and I cut it up into bonds,

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.640
what is the minimum number of steps I need to take

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:39.720
to reform that molecule from atoms?

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:42.600
So reusability of previously formed things

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.440
is somehow fundamental to the part of the box.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.400
It's like a memory in the universe, right?

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.720
I'm making lots of leaps here.

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:48.840
Like, it's kind of weird.

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.880
I'm saying, right, there's a process that can form

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.200
the A and the B and the C, let's say.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.320
And then there's, and because we've formed A and B before,

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.320
we can use A and B again with no extra cost,

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:00.080
except one unit.

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.560
So that's the kind of what the chain of events.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.240
And that's how you think about memory here

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.960
when you say the universe,

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:07.560
when you talk about the universe

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.880
or life is the universe creating memory.

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:12.880
Exactly.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.240
So we went through chemical space

01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.960
and we looked at the assembly numbers

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:18.600
and we were able to classify it.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.600
We said, okay, let's test it, let's go.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.960
So we're able to take a whole bunch of molecules

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.480
and assign an assembly index to them, okay?

01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:30.720
And it's just a function of the number of bonds

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:32.360
in the molecule and how much symmetry.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.800
So literally, assembly theory is a measure

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.920
of how little symmetry a molecule has.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.600
And so the more asymmetry, the more information,

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.440
the more weird it is,

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:44.400
like a Jackson Pollock or some description.

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.760
So I then went and did a load of experiments.

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.960
And I basically took those molecules,

01:35:49.960 --> 01:35:51.320
I cut them up in the mass spec

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.640
and measured the number of peaks

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:55.200
without any knowledge of the molecule.

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.200
And we found the assembly number,

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.600
there was almost a, not quite a one-to-one correlation,

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.760
but almost because not all bonds are equal,

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:03.920
they have different energies.

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.000
I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.720
NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance,

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.760
which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:13.120
and get a signature out.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.120
And I also used infrared.

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.240
And infrared and NMR almost gave us a one-to-one correlation.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.600
So what am I saying?

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.840
Saying by taking a molecule

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:26.080
and doing either infrared or NMR or mass spec,

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.120
I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.400
and then put it on a scale.

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:35.640
And what we did in the next part of the work

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.200
is we took molecules randomly from the environment,

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:41.440
from outer space, from all around earth,

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:46.440
from the sea, from Antarctica and from fossils and so on.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.760
And even NASA, because they didn't believe us,

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:53.040
blinded some samples and that we found

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:57.480
that all these samples that came from biology

01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:00.560
produced molecules that had a very high assembly number

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.920
above a threshold of about 15.

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:05.600
So basically the other stuff

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:08.680
that came from an ebiotic origin was low.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:10.240
There was no complexity there.

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.720
So we suddenly realized that on earth, at least,

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:16.200
there is a cutoff that natural phenomena

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.720
cannot produce molecules

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.080
that need more than 15 steps to make them.

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.320
So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of life,

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.440
a scale of technology as well.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:30.520
And literally you could just go sniffing for molecules

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:33.360
off earth, on Titan, on Mars.

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.680
And when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.760
that gives you more than 15 parts,

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:40.640
you'll know pretty much for sure

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:43.200
that it had to be produced by evolution.

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.400
And this allowed me to come up with a general definition

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.360
of life based on assembly theory,

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.600
to say that if I find an object

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.760
that has a large number of parts, say an iPhone,

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.560
or Boeing 747, or any complex object,

01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:00.400
and I can find it in abundance and cut it up,

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.080
I can tell you whether that has been produced

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:05.000
by an informational process or not.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.720
And that's what assembly theory kind of does.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.120
But it goes a bit further.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.280
I then realized that this isn't just about life,

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.320
it's about causation.

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.840
So actually, it tells you about

01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.400
whether there's a causal structure.

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:19.040
So now I can look at objects in the universe,

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.800
say that again, there's cup, and say, right,

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.760
I'm gonna look at how many independent parts it has.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.560
So that's the assembly number.

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.000
I'll then look at the abundance, how many cups?

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.800
There are two on this table, maybe there's a few more,

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:31.160
you got snatched away.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:36.160
So assembly is a function of the complexity of the object

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:39.400
times the number of copy numbers of that object,

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.920
or a function of the copy number normalized.

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:45.120
So I realized there's a new quantity in the universe.

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.160
You have energy, entropy, and assembly.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.240
So assembly, the way we should think about that

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.240
is how much reusability there is.

01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:57.880
Because what reusability is like,

01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.720
can you play devil's advocate to this?

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.080
Could this just be a nice

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:10.360
tertiary signal for living organisms?

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:13.440
Like some kind of distant signal that's,

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.160
yeah, this is a nice property,

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.760
but it's not capturing something fundamental.

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.280
Or do you think reusability is something fundamental

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.600
to life in complex organisms?

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.640
I think reusability is fundamental in the universe,

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:27.680
not just for life in complex organisms,

01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:29.440
it's about causation.

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.560
So I think assembly tells you, if you find objects,

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.880
because you can do this with trajectories as well,

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:36.720
you think about it,

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:41.720
that the fact there are objects in the universe, on Earth,

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.280
is weird.

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:45.240
You think about it,

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:48.120
we should just have a combinatorial explosion of stuff.

01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:53.120
The fact that not everything exists is really weird.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.040
Now then.

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:58.320
Yeah, and then as I'm looking at two mugs

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:04.160
and the things that exist are similar and multiply

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.120
in copies of each other.

01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.200
So I would say that assembly allows you

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.840
to do something that statistical mechanics

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.760
and people looking at entropy have got stuck with

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.960
for a while.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.440
So I'm making it pretty bold.

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.400
I mean, I'm writing a paper with Sarah Walker

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.960
on this at the moment.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.280
And we're realizing,

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.360
we don't wanna get ahead of ourselves

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.280
because I think that there's lots of ways

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.560
where this is a really interesting idea.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:33.480
It works for molecules and it appears to work

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.560
for any objects produced by causation.

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.480
Cause you can take a motor car,

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:37.680
you can look at the assembly of the motor car,

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:39.760
look at a book, look at the assembly of the book.

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.600
Assembly theory tells you there's a way

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.960
of compressing and reusing.

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.760
And so when people, I talk to information theorists,

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.840
they say, oh, this is just logical depth.

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.320
I say it is like logical depth,

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:53.960
but it's experimentally measurable.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.760
They say, oh, it's a bit like Komogorov complexity.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:57.840
But it's computable.

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.600
And now, okay, it's not infinitely computable,

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:02.320
gets MP hard very quickly, right?

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.200
It's very hard problem when you could get,

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.280
but it's a computable enough,

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.240
you could tractable enough to be able to tell

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.800
the difference between a molecule that's been formed

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:13.640
by the random background and by causation.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.560
And I think that that's really interesting

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:18.360
because until now,

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:21.040
there's no way of measuring complexity objectively.

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:26.120
Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.400
and programs and human beings to label things.

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.520
Assembly is label free.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.040
Well, not entirely.

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.880
We can talk about what that means in a minute.

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.880
Okay, my brain has been broken a couple times here.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.320
I'm sorry, I explained it really badly.

01:41:43.320 --> 01:41:44.880
No, it was very well explained.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:45.840
It was just fascinating.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:50.280
And it's, my brain is broken into pieces

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.880
and I'm trying to assemble it.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:58.240
So MP hard, so when you have a molecule,

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.080
you're trying to figure out, okay,

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.840
if we were to reuse parts of this molecule,

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.840
which parts can we reuse as an optimization problem,

01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:13.560
MP hard, to figure out the minimum amount

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:18.200
of reused components that will create this molecule.

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.720
And it becomes difficult when you start

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.760
to look at a huge, huge molecules, arbitrarily large.

01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:25.160
Cause I'm also like mapping this.

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.800
Can I think about this in complexity generally,

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.840
like looking at a cellular automata system

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:35.600
and saying, can this be used as a measure of complexity

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.760
for like arbitrarily complicated system?

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.400
Yeah, I think it can.

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:41.240
It can.

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.880
And I think that the question is, and what's the benefit?

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.560
Cause there's plenty of, I mean,

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.600
in computer science and mathematics and physics,

01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:51.120
people have been really seriously studying

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:53.240
complexity for a long time.

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:55.160
And I think there's a really interesting problems

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:58.600
of where we course grade and we lose information.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:00.160
And all assembly theory does really,

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:03.240
assembly theory just explains weak emergence.

01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:06.040
And so what assembly theory says, look,

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.920
going from the atoms that interact,

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:12.040
those first replicators that build one another,

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:14.960
assembly at the minimal level just tells you evidence

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.920
that there's been replication and selection.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:20.440
And I think the more selected something is,

01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:22.520
the higher the assembly.

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.080
And so we were able to start to know how to look

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.160
for selection in the universe.

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.440
If you go to the moon,

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.160
there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.960
except the human artifacts we've left there.

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.080
So again, let's go back to the sandbox.

01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:37.880
In assembly theory says,

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.080
if all the sand grains could stick together,

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.200
that's the infinite combinatorial explosion in the universe.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.800
That should be the default.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:45.960
We don't have that.

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:48.600
Now let's assemble sand grains together

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.080
and do them in every possible way.

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:54.760
So we have a series of minimal operations

01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.200
that can move the sand together.

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:57.920
But all that doesn't exist either.

01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:59.920
Now, because we have specific memory where we say,

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:02.280
well, we're gonna put three sand grains in line or four

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:05.440
and make a cross or a triangle or something unsymmetrical.

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.640
And once we've made the triangle

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:07.480
and the unsymmetrical thing,

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:09.280
we remember that we can use it again

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:10.920
because on that causal chain.

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.480
So what assembly theory allows you to do

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.680
is go to the actual object that you exist,

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.120
you find in space.

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:19.040
And actually the way you get there is by disassembling.

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.360
It's disassembly theory works by disassembling objects

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:27.720
you have and understanding the steps to create them.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.160
And it works for molecules beautifully

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:31.760
because you just break bonds.

01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:33.920
But like you said, it's gonna be hard, very difficult.

01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:35.600
It's a difficult problem to figure out

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.600
how to break them apart.

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:37.600
For molecules, it's easy.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:40.800
If you just keep low enough in molecular weight space,

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:41.720
it's good enough.

01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:43.880
So it's a complete theory.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.320
When we start to think about objects,

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.960
we can start to assign,

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.080
we can start to think about things at different levels,

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.560
different atoms, what you assign as your atom.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.640
So in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:57.280
because the word atom, I mean smallest breakable part.

01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:59.720
So in a molecule, the atom is the bond

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.440
because you break bonds, not atoms, right?

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.120
So in a car, the atom might be, I don't know,

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:09.840
a small amount of iron or the smallest reusable part,

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.520
a rivet, a piece of plastic or something.

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:14.800
So you gotta be really careful.

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.480
In a microprocessor, the atoms might be transistors.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:23.480
And so the amount of assembly that something has

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:24.760
is a function.

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.640
You have to look at the atom level.

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.240
What are your parts?

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:29.080
What are you counting?

01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.800
That's one of the things you get to choose.

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:32.760
What is, at what scale is the atom?

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.800
What is the minimal thing?

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.760
I mean, there's a huge amounts of trade-offs

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:39.720
in when you approach a system and try to analyze.

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:42.480
Like if you approach earth, you're an alien civilization,

01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:45.000
try to study earth, what is the atom

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.440
for trying to measure the complexity of life?

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.600
Is it, are humans the atoms?

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.560
I would say to start with, you just use molecules.

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:56.080
I can say for sure, if there are molecules

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.280
of sufficient complexity on earth,

01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.800
then I know that life has made them.

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.440
And then go further and show technology.

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.920
There are molecules that exist on earth

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.120
that are not possible even by biology.

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.520
You needed technology and you needed microprocessors

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.800
to get there.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:11.520
So that's really cool.

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.720
And there's a correlation between that,

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:18.640
between the coolness of that and assembly number,

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:21.640
whatever the measure, what would you call the measure?

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.600
Assembly index.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.440
Yeah, assembly index.

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.760
Yeah, so there are three kind of fundamental

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:26.760
kind of labels we have.

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.000
So there's the quantity of assembly

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.200
and the assembly, so if you have a box,

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.600
let's just have a box of molecules.

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.280
So I'm gonna have my box.

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:36.600
We count the number of identical molecules

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:38.080
and then we chop each molecule up

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:40.560
in an individual molecule class

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.320
and calculate the assembly number.

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.800
So basically you then have a function

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:49.480
that sums over all the molecules for each assembly

01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:50.720
and then you divide through.

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.280
So you make it divide through by the number of molecules.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.240
So that's the assembly index for the box.

01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.680
So that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box.

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.120
So basically the assembly equation we come up with

01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:05.040
is like basically the sum of e to the power

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.480
of the assembly index for molecule i

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.600
times the number of copies of the molecule i

01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:11.520
and then you normalize.

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.480
So you sum them all up and then normalize.

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:16.440
So some boxes are gonna be more assembled than others.

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:17.800
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:19.960
So if you were to look at me as a box,

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.880
so say I'm a box, am I assembling my parts?

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:27.080
In terms of like, how do you know what's my assembly index?

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:28.800
So I'd be gentle.

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.000
So let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:34.600
So let's just take a pile of sand the same way as you

01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:39.600
and I would take you and just cut up all the molecules.

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.600
I mean, and look at the number of copies

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.880
and assembly number.

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:46.280
So in sand, let's say there's probably gonna be nothing

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:48.480
more than the assembly number of two or three,

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.000
but there might be trillions and trillions of sand grains.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.880
In your body, there might be,

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.160
the assembly number is gonna be higher,

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.320
but there might not be quite as many copies

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:01.240
because the molecular weight is higher.

01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:03.040
So you do wanna average it out.

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.360
You can average, you do average it.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.160
I'm not defined by the most impressive molecules.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.720
No, no, you're an average in your volume.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.520
Well, I mean, we're just working this out,

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:13.520
but what's really cool is that you're gonna have

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.160
a really high assembly.

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:16.720
The sand will have a very low assembly.

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:19.520
Your causal power is much higher.

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:22.960
You get to make decisions, you're alive, you're aspiring.

01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:26.480
Assembly says something about causal power in the universe.

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:28.880
And that's not supposed to exist

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.600
because physicists don't accept

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:33.160
that causation exists at the bottom.

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.640
So I understand at the chemical level

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:37.720
why the assembly is causation.

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:38.640
Why is it causation?

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:41.000
Because it's capturing the memory.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:41.840
Exactly.

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:45.720
Capturing memory, but there's not an action to it.

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:50.720
So I'm trying to see how it leads to life.

01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:53.040
Well, it's what life does.

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:55.680
So I think it's, we don't know.

01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:56.520
So.

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:57.360
Yeah, that's a good question.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.160
What is life versus what does life do?

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.520
Yeah, so this is the definition of life.

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:04.480
The only definition we need, right?

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:05.320
What's the assembly?

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.960
Is basically that life is able to create objects

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.040
in abundance that are so complex,

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.720
the assembly number is so high,

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.760
they can't possibly form in an environment

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:20.360
where there's just random interactions.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.200
Yeah.

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.960
So suddenly you can put life on a scale

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:27.880
and then life doesn't exist actually in that sense.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:30.320
It's just how evolved you are.

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:33.080
And you as an object,

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:35.680
because you have incredible causal power,

01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:40.680
you can go and launch rockets or build cars

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:46.360
or create drugs or, you can do so many things.

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:49.000
You can build stuff, build more artifacts

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.360
that show that you have had causal power.

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.360
And that causal power was this kind of a lineage.

01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.840
And I think that over time,

01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:02.600
I've been realizing that physics as a discipline

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:04.960
has a number of problems associated with it.

01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.360
Me as a chemist is kind of interesting,

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.200
that assembly theory, and I'm really,

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:13.520
I wanna maintain some credibility in the physicist's eyes,

01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:14.440
but I have to push them

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.120
because physics is a really good discipline.

01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:22.280
Physics is about reducing the belief system,

01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.760
but they're down to some things in their belief system,

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.800
which is kind of really makes me kind of grumpy,

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.720
because number one is requiring order

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:33.440
at the beginning universe magically, we don't need that.

01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:35.240
The second is the second law.

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:38.160
Well, we don't actually need that.

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:40.320
This is blasphemous.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:43.440
In a minute, I'll recover my career in a second,

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.000
although I think the only good thing

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.160
about being the Regis chair

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:47.960
means I think there has to be an act of parliament

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:48.800
to fire me.

01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:49.640
Yeah.

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:54.640
But you can always go to Lee's Twitter and protest.

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:02.560
So we've got the order at the beginning.

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:03.400
Second law.

01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:04.240
Yeah, the second law,

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.360
and the fact that causation is emergent, right?

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:09.360
And that time is emergent.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.200
John Carroll just turned off this program.

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.880
I think he believes that it's emergent,

01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:15.600
so causation is not emergent.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.920
That's clearly incorrect,

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.160
because we wouldn't exist otherwise.

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:23.480
So physicists have kind of got confused about time.

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:25.600
Time is a real thing.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.360
Well, I mean, so look,

01:51:29.480 --> 01:51:31.160
I'm very happy with the current description

01:51:31.160 --> 01:51:32.720
of the universe, as physics gives me,

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:33.960
because I can do a lot of stuff, right?

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:36.560
I can go to the moon with Newtonian physics, I think,

01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:41.080
and I can understand the orbit of Mercury with relativity.

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:43.960
And I can build transistors with quantum mechanics, right?

01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.760
And I can do all this stuff.

01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:47.280
So I'm not saying the physics is wrong.

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:50.480
I'm just saying, if we say that time is fundamental,

01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.080
i.e. time is non-negotiable, there's a global clock,

01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:57.560
I don't need to require that there's order

01:51:57.560 --> 01:51:59.720
being magically made in the past,

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.960
because that asymmetry is built into the way

01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:03.320
the universe is.

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.960
So if time is fundamental,

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:09.560
I mean, you've been referring to as kind of

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.880
an interesting formulation of that is memory.

01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:14.720
Yeah.

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:18.920
So time is hard to like put a finger on,

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.560
like what the hell are we talking about?

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:21.720
Well, it's just a direction,

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.640
but memory is a construction,

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.680
especially when you have like,

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:29.000
think about these local pockets of complexity,

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000
these non-zero assembly index entities

01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.360
that's being constructed and they remember.

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:39.160
Never forget molecules.

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:41.920
But remember, the thing is I invented assembly theory.

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.440
I'll tell you I invented it.

01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.160
When I was a kid, I mean, the thing is,

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.320
I keep making fun of myself from a search group.

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:49.640
I've only ever had one idea.

01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:52.520
I keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or so

01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:54.040
since I had that idea.

01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:56.480
Well, aren't you the idea that the universe had?

01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:58.520
So it's very kind of hierarchical.

01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.360
Anyway, go ahead.

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.200
I'm sorry.

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:02.920
That's very poetic.

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:04.840
So I think I came up with assembly theory

01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:07.280
with the following idea when I was a kid.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.560
I was obsessed about survival kits.

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:12.520
What is the minimum stuff I would need

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:14.040
to basically replicate my reality?

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:17.080
And I love computers and I love technology

01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:18.360
or what technology is going to become.

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:20.400
So I imagined that I would have

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:22.880
basically this really big truck full of stuff.

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:25.520
And I thought, well, can I delete some of that stuff out?

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.520
Can I have a blueprint?

01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.680
And then, and in the end, I kept making this,

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:29.520
making it smaller.

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:32.280
I got to maybe half a truck and then to a suitcase.

01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:34.000
And then went, okay, well, screw it.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.600
I wanna carry my entire technology in my pocket.

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.640
How do I do it?

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.200
And I'm not gonna launch into a Steve Jobbie

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:43.200
and I'm an iPlayer.

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.960
I came up with a Matchbox survival kit.

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:47.280
In that Matchbox survival kit,

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:49.000
I would have the minimum stuff that would allow me

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.600
to interact the environment, to build my shelter,

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:57.280
to build a fishing rod, to build a water purification system.

01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:59.480
And it's kind of like, so what did I use in my box

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.640
to assemble in the environment,

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:04.280
to assemble, to assemble, to assemble?

01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:07.040
And I realized I could make a causal chain

01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.160
in my survival kit.

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:10.240
So I guess that's probably why I've been obsessed

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:12.000
with assembly theory for so long.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And I was just pre-configured to find it somewhere.

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.400
And when I saw it in molecules,

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:24.360
I realized that the causal structure that we say emerges

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:27.120
and the physics kind of gets really stuck

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.560
because they're saying that time,

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:29.720
you can go backwards in time.

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:33.160
I mean, how do we let physicists get away with the notion

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:35.200
that we can go back in time and meet ourselves?

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:40.200
I mean, that's clearly a very hard thing to let...

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.000
Physicists would not let other sciences get away

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.120
with that kind of heresy, right?

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:50.640
So why are physicists allowed to get away with it?

01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:51.480
Let's-

01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.280
So first of all, to push back to play devil's advocate,

01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:58.320
you are clearly married to the idea of memory.

01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:02.240
You see in this, again, Rick from Rick and Morty way,

01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:06.400
you see you have these deep dreams of the universe

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.920
that is writing the story through its memories,

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.880
through its chemical compounds

01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:12.440
that are just building on top of each other.

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:16.000
And then they find useful components they can reuse.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.760
And then the reused components create systems

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:21.760
that themselves are then reused

01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:24.040
and all in this way construct things.

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:27.840
But when you think of that as memory,

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:31.920
it seems like quite sad that you can walk that back.

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.840
But at the same time, it feels like that memory,

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:37.000
you can walk in both directions on that memory

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:37.960
in terms of time.

01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:39.480
You could walk in both directions,

01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:42.000
but I don't think that makes any sense

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:47.040
because the problem that I have with time being reversible

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.440
is that, I mean, I'm just a,

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.200
I'm a dumb experimental chemist, right?

01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:58.920
So I love burning stuff, burning stuff and building stuff.

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.160
But when I think of reversible phenomena,

01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:02.240
I imagine in my head,

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:05.240
I have to actually manufacture some time.

01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:08.160
I have to borrow time from the universe to do that.

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.080
I can't, when anyone says,

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:13.160
let's imagine that we can go back in time or reversibility.

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.000
You can't do that.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.200
You can't step out of time.

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:16.320
Time is non-negotiable.

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:17.160
It's happening.

01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.520
No, but see, you're assuming that time is fundamental,

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.760
which most of us do when we go day to day,

01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:27.280
but it takes a leap of wild imagination

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.760
to think that time is emergent.

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.960
No, time is not emergent.

01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:32.920
Yeah, I mean, this is an argument we can have,

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:35.960
but I believe I can come up with an experiment.

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:37.560
An experiment that proves that time

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:38.880
cannot possibly be emergent?

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:43.320
An experiment that shows how assembly theory

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:48.200
kind of is the way that the universe produces selection

01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:50.680
and that selection gives rise to life.

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:53.440
And also to say, well, hang on,

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:55.320
we could allow ourselves to have a theory

01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.200
that requires us to have these statements to be possible.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:03.160
Like we need to have order in the past,

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:06.240
or we can have used the past hypothesis,

01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:10.840
which is order in the past, but as well, okay.

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.840
And we have to have an arrow of time.

01:57:12.840 --> 01:57:16.400
We have to require that entropy increases.

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.000
And we have to say, and then we can say, look,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.720
the universe is completely closed and there's no novelty,

01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:23.960
or that novelty is predetermined.

01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:26.440
What I'm saying is very, very important

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:28.680
that time is fundamental, which means,

01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.080
if you think about it,

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.680
the universe becomes more and more novel each step.

01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:33.920
It generates this more states

01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:35.880
and next step than it was before.

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:37.960
So that means bigger search.

01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:39.920
So what I'm saying is that the universe

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:42.120
wasn't capable of consciousness at day one.

01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:46.240
Actually, because it didn't have enough states.

01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:49.280
But today, the universe is, so it's like, how?

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:50.840
All right, all right, hold on a second.

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:53.960
Now we've pissed off the panpsychist too.

01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:54.800
Okay.

01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:57.960
No, this is brilliant, sorry.

01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.720
Part of me is just joking, having fun with this thing,

01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:03.080
but because you're saying a lot of brilliant stuff

01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:05.840
and I'm trying to slow it down before my brain explodes.

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:09.440
I wanna break apart some of the fascinating things

01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:10.360
you're saying.

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:14.720
So novelty, novelty is increasing in the universe

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:17.000
because the number of states is increasing.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.480
What do you mean by states?

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.800
So I think the physicists almost got everything right.

01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:22.960
I can't fault them at all.

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:24.480
I just think there's a little bit of dogma.

01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:26.120
I'm just trying to play devil's advocate.

01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:28.800
I'm very happy to be entirely wrong on this, right?

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:31.120
I'm not right on many things at all.

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:34.080
But if I can make less assumptions

01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:35.960
about the universe with this,

01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:38.120
then potentially that's a more powerful way

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.760
of looking at things.

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:41.840
If you think of time as fundamental,

01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:43.480
you can make less assumptions overall.

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:44.320
Exactly.

01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:48.040
Fundamental, I don't need to add on a magical second law

01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.520
because the second law comes out of the fact

01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:52.760
the universe is actually, there's more states available.

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:54.600
I mean, we might even be able to do weird things

01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:55.920
like dark energy in the universe

01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:58.680
might actually just be time, right?

01:58:58.680 --> 01:59:01.000
Yeah, but then you still have to explain

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.560
why time is fundamental

01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:04.480
because I can give you one explanation

01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:07.040
that's simpler than time and say God.

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.720
You know, like just because it's simple

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:12.640
doesn't mean it's, you still have to explain God

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.240
and you still have to explain time.

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:15.600
Like why is it fundamental?

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:18.040
So let's just say existence is default,

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:19.600
which means time is the default.

01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:22.040
So how did you go from the existence

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:23.360
to the default of time?

01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:25.000
Well, look, we exist, right?

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.040
So let's just be very-

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.040
We're yet to talk about what exist means.

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:30.440
All right, let's go all the way back.

01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:31.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:32.600
I think it's very poetic and beautiful

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:34.200
what you're weaving into this.

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:37.160
I don't think this conversation is even about the assembly

01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:41.040
which is fascinating and we'll keep mentioning

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.040
in assembly index and this idea

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:47.000
that I don't think is necessarily connected to time.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.480
Oh, I think it is deeply connected.

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:50.240
I can't explain it yet.

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:52.600
So you don't think everything you've said

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:56.080
about assembly theory and assembly index

01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:58.640
can still be correct even if time is emergent?

01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:00.800
So yeah, right now assembly theory

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:02.160
appears to work.

02:00:02.160 --> 02:00:04.160
I appear to be able to measure objects

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:05.800
of high assembly in a mass spectrometer

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:08.200
and look at their abundance and all that's fine, right?

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:09.840
It's a nice, if nothing else,

02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.960
it's a nice way of looking at how molecules

02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:13.280
can compress things.

02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:17.200
Now, am I saying that a time has to be fundamental

02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:18.760
or not emergent for assembly theory to work?

02:00:18.760 --> 02:00:23.360
No, I think I'm saying that the universe,

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.760
it appears that the universe has many different ways

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:26.600
of using time.

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:28.400
You could have three different types of time.

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:30.040
You could just have time that's,

02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:30.880
the way I would think of it,

02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:33.360
if you want to hold on to emergent time,

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.200
I think that's fine.

02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:35.600
Let's do that for a second.

02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:37.480
Hold on to emergent time

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:39.600
and the universe is just doing its thing.

02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:42.280
Then assembly time only exists when the universe starts

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:43.800
to write memories through bonds.

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:46.680
So let's just say there's rocks running around,

02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:49.360
when the bond happens and selection starts,

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:54.360
suddenly the universe is remembering cause in the past

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:58.000
and those structures will have effects in the future.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.920
So suddenly a new type of time emerges

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:02.400
at that point, which has a direction.

02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.240
And I think Sean Carroll at this point

02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:06.560
might even turn the podcast back on and go,

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.840
okay, I can deal with that, that's fine.

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.960
But I'm just basically trying to condense the conversation

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.080
and say, hey, let's just have time fundamental

02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:15.360
and see how that screws with people's minds.

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.720
You're triggering people by saying fundamental.

02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:18.560
Why not?

02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.360
Well, you just say like, let's say.

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:22.200
Look, I'm walking through the wall.

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:27.000
Why should I grow up in a world where time,

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.080
I don't go back in time.

02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:30.800
I don't meet myself in the past.

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:34.360
There are no aliens coming from the future, right?

02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:35.840
You know, it's just like.

02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:38.720
No, no, but that's not, no, no, no, no, hold on a second.

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:41.840
That's like saying, we're talking about biology

02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:44.920
or like evolutionary psychology and you saying,

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:48.560
okay, let's just assume that clothing is fundamental.

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.440
People wearing clothes is fundamental.

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.360
It's like, no, no, no, no, wait a minute.

02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:55.720
You can't, like, I think you're gonna get a lot of trouble

02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:57.640
if you assume time is fundamental.

02:01:58.440 --> 02:02:00.080
Give me one reason why I'm getting into trouble

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:01.360
with time being fundamental.

02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:06.360
Because you might not understand the origins of this memory

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:08.120
that might be deeper.

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.200
Like that, this memory, that could be a thing

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:13.320
that's explaining the construction

02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:17.720
of these higher complexities better

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:21.200
than just saying it's a search.

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:26.200
It's chemicals doing a search for reusable, reusable chemicals.

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.520
Reusable structures that they can then use as bricks

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:32.680
to build a house.

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:34.400
Okay, so I accept that.

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:37.120
So let's go back a second because it's a kind of,

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:40.720
it is, I wanted to drop the time bomb at this part

02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:42.160
because I think we can carry on discussing it

02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:45.640
for many, many, many, many, many days, many months.

02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:50.920
But I'm happy to accept that it might be wrong.

02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:53.800
But what I would like to do is imagine a universe

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:56.600
where time is fundamental and time is emergent

02:02:56.600 --> 02:03:00.320
and ask, let's just then talk about causation

02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:02.880
because physicists require that causation,

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:04.400
so this is where I'm gonna go.

02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:08.440
Causation emerges and it doesn't exist at the microscale.

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.880
Well, that clearly is wrong

02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:12.240
because if causation has to emerge at the macroscale,

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:13.640
life cannot emerge.

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:15.200
So how does life emerge?

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:17.920
Life requires molecules to bump into each other,

02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.840
produce replicators.

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.880
Those replicators need to produce polymers.

02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:24.600
There needs to be cause and effect at the molecular level.

02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:26.560
There needs to be a non-agordic

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:29.640
to an agordic transition at some point.

02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:34.640
And those replicators have consequence,

02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:37.560
material consequence in the universe.

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.760
Physicists just say, oh, you know what?

02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:42.480
I'm gonna have a bunch of particles in a box.

02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:44.880
I'm gonna think about it in a Newtonian way,

02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:48.040
in a quantum way, and I'll add on an arrow of time

02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:50.200
so I can label things.

02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:51.840
And causation will happen magically later.

02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:52.680
Well, how?

02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:53.600
Explain causation.

02:03:54.920 --> 02:03:55.760
And they can't.

02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:58.520
The only way I can reconcile causation

02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:00.600
is having a fundamental time

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:03.280
because this allows me to have a deterministic universe

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.480
that creates novelty.

02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:08.320
And there's so many things to unpack here,

02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:09.760
but let's go back to the point.

02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:12.560
You said, can assembly theory work with emergent time?

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:16.560
Sure, it can, but it doesn't give me a deep satisfaction

02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:21.080
about how causation and assembly gives rise

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:24.640
to these objects that move through time and space.

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:27.200
And again, what am I saying to bring it back?

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:31.280
I can say, without fear, take this water bottle

02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:32.120
and look at this water bottle

02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:32.960
and look at the features on it.

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:35.800
There's writing, you've got a load of them.

02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:38.680
I know that causal structures gave rise to this.

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:40.920
In fact, I'm not looking at just one water bottle here.

02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:42.120
I'm looking at every water bottle

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.600
that's ever been conceived of by humanity.

02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:47.040
This here is a special object.

02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.760
In fact, Leibniz knew this.

02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:52.080
Leibniz, who was at the same time as Newton,

02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:53.200
he kind of got stuck.

02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:56.040
I think Leibniz actually invented assembly theory.

02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:57.040
He gave soul.

02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:58.680
The soul that you see in objects

02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:01.120
wasn't the mystical soul, it is assembly.

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:04.000
It is a fact there's been a history of objects related.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.760
And without the object in the past,

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.360
this object wouldn't exist.

02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:12.640
There is a lineage and there is conserved structures,

02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:14.760
causal structures have given rise to those.

02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:15.600
Fair enough.

02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:18.080
And you're saying it's just a simpler view

02:05:18.080 --> 02:05:20.640
if time is fundamental.

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:23.640
And it shakes the physicist cage a bit, right?

02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:25.840
Because I'm saying, but I think that...

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:30.840
I just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages.

02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:34.480
I would say that, you know, Lee Smolin,

02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:35.720
I don't want to speak for Lee.

02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:37.640
I'm talking to Lee about this.

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:39.440
I think Lee also is in agreement

02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.360
that time has to be fundamental.

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:42.840
But I think he goes further.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:44.680
Even in space, I don't think you can go back

02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:46.920
to the same place in space.

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:48.320
I've been to Austin a few times now.

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.080
This is my, I think, third time I've been to Austin.

02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.440
Is Austin in the same place?

02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:53.280
No.

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.520
The solar system is moving through space.

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:58.880
I'm not going back in the same space.

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:00.000
Locally, I am.

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:03.320
Every event in the universe is unique.

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:05.640
In space.

02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:06.480
And time.

02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:07.320
And time.

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:10.200
Doesn't mean we can't go back there.

02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:13.240
Doesn't mean we can't go back, though.

02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:18.240
I mean, let's just rest this conversation,

02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:22.560
which was beautiful, with a quote from the Rolling Stones

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.240
that you can't always get what you want,

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:27.800
which is, you want time to be fundamental,

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:30.080
but if you try, you'll get what you need,

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:32.120
which is assembly theory.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:34.280
Okay, let me ask you about,

02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:36.720
continue talking about complexity,

02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:41.800
and to clarify it with this beautiful theory of yours,

02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:43.680
that you're developing,

02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:45.320
and I'm sure we'll continue developing,

02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:48.320
both in the lab and in theory.

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:52.280
Yeah, it can't be said enough,

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:56.040
just the ideas you're playing with in your head are just,

02:06:56.040 --> 02:06:58.120
and we've been talking about, are just beautiful.

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:01.120
So if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally,

02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:05.760
maybe in an admiring, romantic way,

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:09.200
how does complexity emerge from simple rules?

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:11.320
The why, the how.

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:15.000
Okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.440
I would say that the problem I have right now is,

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.320
I mean, you're right, we can, about time as well.

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:22.600
The problem is, I have this hammer called assembly,

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:24.560
and everything I see is a nail.

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:27.480
So now, let's just apply it to all sorts of things.

02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:28.920
We take the Bernard instability.

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:31.160
The Bernard instability is you have oil,

02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:35.160
if you heat up oil, let's say on a frying pan,

02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.520
when you get convection, you get honeycomb patterns.

02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:40.600
Take the formation of snowflakes, right?

02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:45.600
Take the emergence of a tropical storm

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:47.600
or the storm on Jupiter.

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:50.120
When people say, let's talk about complexity in general,

02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:51.640
what they're saying is,

02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:54.440
let's take this collection of objects

02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:56.920
that are correlated in some way

02:07:56.920 --> 02:08:00.200
and try and work out how many moving parts

02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.000
or how this got, how this exists.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.880
So what people have been doing for a very long time

02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:09.360
is taking complexity and counting what they've lost,

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:11.200
calculating the entropy.

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:13.960
And the reason why I'm pushing very hard on assembly

02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:16.440
is entropy tells you how much you've lost.

02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:18.840
It doesn't tell you the microstates are gone.

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.800
But if you embrace the bottom up with assembly,

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:26.400
those states, and you then understand the causal chain

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:28.760
that gives rise to the emergence.

02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:31.520
So what I think assembly will help us do

02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:34.360
is understand weak emergence, at the very least,

02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:39.800
and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.800
And I've been fascinated with complexity theory

02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:43.640
for many years.

02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:46.680
I mean, as soon as I could,

02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:48.480
I learned of the Mandelbrot set

02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:52.640
and I could just type it up in my computer and run it

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:55.800
and just show it and see it kind of unfold.

02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:58.840
It was just this kind of,

02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:01.480
this mathematical reality that existed in front of me,

02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:04.040
I just found incredible.

02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:07.120
But then I realized that actually we were cheating.

02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:09.520
We're putting in the boundary conditions all the time.

02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:11.520
We're putting in information.

02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:13.640
And so when people talk to me

02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:16.080
about the complexity of things,

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:17.440
I say, but relative what?

02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:18.760
How do you measure them?

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.600
So my attempt, my small attempt, naive attempt,

02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:25.440
because there's many greater minds than mine

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:27.560
on the planet right now thinking about this properly,

02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:29.440
and you've had some of them on the podcast, right?

02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:31.780
They're just absolutely fantastic.

02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:35.620
But I'm wondering if we might be able to reformat

02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:39.860
the way we would explore algorithmic complexity

02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:41.100
using assembly.

02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:45.260
What's the minimum number of constraints we need

02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:47.860
in our system for this to unfold?

02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:49.700
So whether it's like, you know,

02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:52.620
if you take some particles and put them in a box,

02:09:52.620 --> 02:09:53.780
at a certain box size,

02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:57.100
you get quasi crystallinity coming out, right?

02:09:57.100 --> 02:10:00.540
But that emergence, it's not magic.

02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:03.780
It must come from the boundary conditions you put in.

02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:07.100
So all I'm saying is a lot of the complexity that we see

02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:10.260
is a direct read of the constraints we put in,

02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.980
but we just don't understand.

02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:14.620
So as I said earlier to the poor origin of life chemists,

02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:17.340
you know, origin of life is a scam.

02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:20.340
I would say lots of complexity calculation theories,

02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:21.660
a bit of a scam,

02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:22.900
because we put the constraints in,

02:10:22.900 --> 02:10:25.260
but we don't count them correctly.

02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:26.140
And I'm wondering if-

02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:28.340
Oh, you're thinking and starting to drop,

02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:31.780
is assembly theory, assembly index

02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:33.340
is a way to count to the constraints?

02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:34.180
Yes, that's it.

02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:35.020
That's all it is.

02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:36.780
So assembly theory doesn't do,

02:10:36.780 --> 02:10:40.060
doesn't lower any of the importance of complexity theory,

02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:42.180
but it allows us to go across domains

02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:44.460
and start to compare things,

02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:46.220
compare the complexity of a molecule,

02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:49.700
of a microprocessor, of the text you've writing,

02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:52.020
of the music you may compose.

02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:55.260
You've tweeted, quote,

02:10:55.260 --> 02:10:58.300
assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood

02:10:58.300 --> 02:11:01.900
we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom.

02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:03.420
So we've applied assembly theory

02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:06.020
to cellular automata in life and chemistry.

02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:09.540
What does Nietzsche have to do with assembly theory?

02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:12.100
Oh, that gets me into free will and everything.

02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:14.540
So let me say that again.

02:11:14.540 --> 02:11:16.580
Assembly theory explains why Nietzsche understood

02:11:16.580 --> 02:11:20.340
we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom,

02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:22.420
limited freedom, I suppose,

02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:25.140
is referring to the fact that there's constraints

02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:28.820
or what is radical freedom?

02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:30.220
What is freedom?

02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:33.500
So Sartre was like believed in absolute freedom

02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:36.700
and that he could do whatever he wanted

02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:38.660
in his imagination.

02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:41.820
And Nietzsche understood that his freedom

02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:43.220
was somewhat more limited.

02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:46.220
And it kind of takes me back to this computer game

02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:47.980
that I played when I was 10.

02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:50.060
So I think it's called Dragon's Lair.

02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:51.740
Okay.

02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:52.580
Do you know Dragon's Lair?

02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.100
I think I know Dragon's Lair, yeah.

02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:56.380
Dragon's Lair, I knew I was being conned, right?

02:11:56.380 --> 02:11:57.740
Dragon's Lair, when you play the game,

02:11:57.740 --> 02:11:59.020
you're lucky that you grew up

02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:01.500
in a basically procedurally generated worlds.

02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:03.140
That was RPG a little bit.

02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:05.620
No, it's like, is it turn-based play?

02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:06.620
Was it? No.

02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:09.500
It was a role-playing game, but really good graphics

02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:11.620
and one of the first laser discs.

02:12:11.620 --> 02:12:13.540
And when you actually flick the stick,

02:12:13.540 --> 02:12:16.540
you took, it's like it was like a graphical adventure game

02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:18.140
with animation.

02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:19.940
And when I played this game, I really,

02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:22.100
you could get through the game in 12 minutes

02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:23.940
if you knew what you were doing, not making mistakes,

02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:25.740
just play the disc, play the disc, play the disc.

02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:27.500
So it was just that timing.

02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:29.700
And actually it was a complete fraud

02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:33.700
because all the animation has been pre-recorded on the disc.

02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:36.140
It's like the Black Mirror, the first interactive

02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:40.660
where they had all the several million kind of permutations

02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.820
of the movie that you could select on Netflix.

02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:44.740
I've forgotten the name of it.

02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:47.700
So this was exactly that in the laser disc.

02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:50.820
You basically go left, go right, fight the ogre,

02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:52.060
slay the dragon.

02:12:52.060 --> 02:12:53.860
And when you flick the joystick at the right time,

02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:55.980
it just goes to the next animation to play.

02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:57.980
It's not really generating it.

02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:00.460
And I played that game and I knew I was being had.

02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:03.220
Oh, okay, I see.

02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:07.300
So to you, Dragon Lair is the first time you realized

02:13:07.300 --> 02:13:09.380
that free will is an illusion.

02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:10.220
Yeah.

02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:14.980
And why does assembly theory give you hints

02:13:14.980 --> 02:13:17.140
about free will, whether it's an illusion or not?

02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:21.340
So not tightly, if I do think I have some will

02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:24.020
and I think I am an agent and I think I can interact

02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:27.100
and I can play around with the model I have of the world

02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:28.300
and the cost functions, right?

02:13:28.300 --> 02:13:30.260
And I can hack my own cost functions,

02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:32.340
which means I have a little bit of free will.

02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:35.180
But as much as I want to do stuff in the universe,

02:13:35.180 --> 02:13:37.340
I don't think I could suddenly say,

02:13:37.340 --> 02:13:38.540
I mean, actually this is ridiculous

02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:39.860
because now I say I could try and do it, right?

02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:41.220
It's like I'm suddenly give up everything

02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:44.180
and become a rapper tomorrow, right?

02:13:44.180 --> 02:13:45.900
Maybe I could try that,

02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:48.700
but I don't have sufficient agency

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:50.060
to make that necessarily happen.

02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:51.500
I'm on a trajectory.

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:52.340
So when in Dragon's Lair,

02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:56.540
I know that I have some trajectories that I can play with

02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:58.940
where Sartre realized he thought

02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:00.780
that he had no assembly, no memory.

02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:03.420
He could just leap across and do everything.

02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:07.580
And Nietzsche said, okay, I realize I don't have full freedom,

02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:09.340
but I have some freedom.

02:14:09.340 --> 02:14:11.300
And the assembly theory basically says that.

02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:14.180
It says, if you have these constraints in your past,

02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:16.420
they limit what you were able to do in the future,

02:14:16.420 --> 02:14:19.300
but you can use them to do amazing things.

02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:23.860
Let's say I'm a poppy plant and I'm creating some opiates.

02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:25.780
The opiates are really interesting molecules.

02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:27.780
I mean, they're obviously great for medicine,

02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:29.740
cause great problems in society,

02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:33.420
but let's imagine we fast forward a billion years.

02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:37.780
What will the opioids look like in a billion years?

02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:38.620
Well, we can guess

02:14:38.620 --> 02:14:41.300
because we can see how those proteins will evolve

02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:44.900
and we can see how the secondary metabolites will change.

02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:46.460
But they can't go radical.

02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:48.580
They can't suddenly become, I don't know,

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:52.260
like a molecule that you find in an OLED in a display.

02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:54.260
They will have some, they will be limited

02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:56.940
by the causal chain that produced them.

02:14:56.940 --> 02:14:59.940
And that's what I'm getting at, saying you're,

02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:03.540
we're predictive, we are unpredictably predictable

02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:06.580
or predictably unpredictable

02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:08.860
within a constraint on the trajectory we're on.

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:11.780
Yeah, so the predictably part is the constraints

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:14.140
of the trajectory and the unpredictable part

02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:16.620
is the part that you still haven't really clarified

02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:20.020
the origin of the little bit of freedom.

02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:20.860
Yeah.

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:22.540
So you're just arguing,

02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:26.740
you're basically saying that radical freedom is impossible.

02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:29.100
You're really operating in a world of constraints

02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:31.780
that are constrained by the memory of the trajectory

02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:34.420
of the chemistry that led to who you are, okay.

02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:39.020
But, you know, even just a tiny bit of freedom,

02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:44.020
even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages,

02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:49.340
if you can move around in that cage a little bit,

02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:50.580
you're free.

02:15:50.580 --> 02:15:51.420
I agree.

02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:55.700
And so the question is in assembly theory,

02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:57.500
if we're thinking about free will,

02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:59.700
where does the little bit of freedom come from?

02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:03.700
What is the eye that can decide to be a rapper?

02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:06.940
What, why, what is that?

02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:10.460
That's a cute little trick we've convinced each other of

02:16:10.460 --> 02:16:13.460
so we can do fun tricks at parties

02:16:13.460 --> 02:16:15.300
or is there something fundamental

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:18.860
that allows us to feel free, to be free?

02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:21.860
I think that that's the question that I want to answer.

02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:23.220
I know you want to answer it.

02:16:23.220 --> 02:16:24.940
And I think it's so profound.

02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:27.140
Let me have a go at it.

02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:30.260
I would say that I don't take the stance of Sam Harris

02:16:30.260 --> 02:16:31.780
because I think Sam Harris, when he said,

02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:33.980
the way he says it is almost, it's really interesting.

02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:35.020
I'd love to talk to him about it.

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:37.620
Sam Harris almost thinks himself out of existence, right?

02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:40.980
Because, do you know what I mean?

02:16:40.980 --> 02:16:43.580
Well, I mean, he has different views

02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:45.340
on consciousness versus free will.

02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:47.420
I think he saves himself with consciousness.

02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:49.980
He thinks himself out of existence with free will.

02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:50.940
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:53.260
So that means there's no point, right?

02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:54.100
So I-

02:16:54.100 --> 02:16:55.820
He's a leaf floating on a river.

02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:57.020
Yeah.

02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:01.540
I think that he's, I don't know,

02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:03.580
I'd love to ask him whether he really believes that

02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:04.620
and then we could play some games.

02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:05.460
Oh yeah.

02:17:05.460 --> 02:17:06.380
No, no, I then would say,

02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:08.900
I'll get him to play a game of cards with me

02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:11.580
and I'll work out the conditions on which he says no.

02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:13.420
And then I'll get him to the conditions he says yes.

02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:14.260
And then I'll trap him

02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:17.180
in his logical inconsistency with that argument.

02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:19.980
Because at some point when he loses enough money

02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:21.940
or the prospect of losing enough money,

02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:26.900
there's a way of basically mapping out a series of,

02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:30.900
so what will is about, let's not call it free will,

02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:34.540
what will is about is to have a series of decisions

02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:36.820
equally weighted in front of you.

02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:39.620
And those decisions aren't necessarily energy minimization.

02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:43.220
Those decisions are a function of the model

02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:45.940
you've made in your mind, you're in your simulation

02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:48.740
and the way you've interacted in reality

02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:52.100
and also other interactions that you're having

02:17:52.100 --> 02:17:55.260
with other individuals and happenstance.

02:17:55.260 --> 02:18:00.260
And I think that there's a little bit of delay in time.

02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:03.820
So I think what you're able to do is say,

02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:06.660
well, I'm gonna do the counterfactual.

02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:08.140
I've done all of them.

02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:10.740
And I'm gonna go this way.

02:18:10.740 --> 02:18:12.060
And you probably don't know why.

02:18:12.060 --> 02:18:14.780
I think free will is actually very complex interaction

02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:18.780
between your unconscious and your conscious brain.

02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:20.700
And I think the reason why we're arguing about it

02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:23.780
is so interesting in that we just,

02:18:23.780 --> 02:18:26.940
some people outsource their free will

02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:28.820
to their unconscious brain.

02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:31.180
And some people try and overthink

02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:33.100
the free will in the conscious brain.

02:18:33.100 --> 02:18:35.460
I would say that Sam Harris has realized

02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:36.900
his conscious brain doesn't have free will

02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:38.620
but his unconscious brain does.

02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:39.660
That's my guess, right?

02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:41.780
And that he can't have access to the unconscious brain.

02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:43.700
Yeah, and that's kind of annoying.

02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:46.420
So he's going to, through meditation,

02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:48.060
come to acceptance with that fact.

02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:50.540
Yeah, which is maybe okay.

02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:55.060
But I do think that I have the ability to make decisions

02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:56.020
and I like my decisions.

02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:58.540
In fact, I mean, this is an argument I have

02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:03.260
with some people that some days I feel I have no free will

02:19:03.260 --> 02:19:04.780
and it's just an illusion.

02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:08.020
And this is one, and it makes me more radical if you like,

02:19:08.020 --> 02:19:11.620
as I get to explore more of the state space.

02:19:11.620 --> 02:19:13.620
And I'm like, I'm gonna try and affect the world now.

02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:15.220
I'm really gonna ask the question

02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:17.620
that maybe I dare not ask or dare not

02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:19.660
or do the thing I dare not do.

02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:21.780
And that allows me to kind of explore more.

02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:25.540
It's funny that if you truly accept

02:19:25.540 --> 02:19:27.020
that there's no free will,

02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:30.700
that is a kind of radical freedom.

02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:32.940
It's funny.

02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:37.660
But you're, because the little bit of the illusion

02:19:37.660 --> 02:19:40.020
under that framework that you have

02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:41.980
that you can make choices,

02:19:41.980 --> 02:19:45.460
if choice is just an illusion of psychology,

02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:47.380
you can do whatever the hell you want.

02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:48.860
But we don't, do we?

02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:49.700
And I think-

02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:51.540
But because you don't truly accept

02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:56.540
that you think that there's a choice,

02:19:56.900 --> 02:20:01.500
which is why you don't just do whatever the hell you want.

02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:03.060
You feel like there's some responsibility

02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:05.580
for making the wrong choice, which is why you don't do it.

02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:06.940
But if you truly accept

02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:08.900
that the choice has already been made,

02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:12.500
then you can go, I don't know,

02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:14.100
what is the most radical thing?

02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:19.860
I mean, but yeah, I wonder what,

02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:21.860
what am I preventing myself from doing

02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:23.500
that I would really want to do?

02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:26.140
Probably like humor stuff.

02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:31.140
Like I would love to, if I could like save a game,

02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:34.500
do the thing, and then reload it later,

02:20:34.500 --> 02:20:37.060
like do undo, it'd probably be humor.

02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:40.340
Just to do something like super hilarious.

02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:43.860
That's super embarrassing.

02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:46.620
And then just go, I mean, it's basically just fun.

02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:47.980
I would add more fun to the world.

02:20:47.980 --> 02:20:49.260
I mean, I sometimes do that.

02:20:49.260 --> 02:20:54.260
Because I sometimes, I try and mess up my reality

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:57.260
in unusual ways by just doing things

02:20:57.260 --> 02:20:59.340
because I'm bored, but not bored.

02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:00.580
I'm not expressing this very well.

02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:02.500
I think that this is a really interesting problem

02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:05.540
that perhaps the hard sciences don't really understand

02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:06.660
that they are responsible for,

02:21:06.660 --> 02:21:09.500
because the question about how life emerged

02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:10.740
and how intelligence emerges

02:21:10.740 --> 02:21:12.300
and consciousness and free will,

02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:14.500
they're all ultimately boiling down

02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:16.740
to some of the same mechanics, I think.

02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:19.300
My feeling is that they are the same problem

02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:20.940
again and again and again.

02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:24.740
The transition from a boring world

02:21:24.740 --> 02:21:26.780
or a world in which there is no selection.

02:21:26.780 --> 02:21:28.580
So I wonder if free will has something to do

02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:30.260
with selection and models,

02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:32.500
and also the models you're generating in the brain

02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:34.140
and also the amount of memory,

02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:35.380
your working memory have available

02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:37.500
any one time to generate counterfactuals.

02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:38.340
Well, that's fascinating.

02:21:38.340 --> 02:21:42.140
So like the decision-making process is a kind of selection

02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:46.660
and that could be just yet another manifestation

02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:49.540
of the selection mechanism that's pervasive

02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:50.380
throughout the universe.

02:21:50.380 --> 02:21:52.620
Okay, that's fascinating to think about.

02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:56.980
Yeah, there's not some kind of fundamental,

02:21:56.980 --> 02:21:59.300
its own thing or something like that,

02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:01.980
that is just yet another example of selection.

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:06.300
Yeah, and in the universe that's intrinsically open,

02:22:06.300 --> 02:22:08.660
you want to do that because you generate novelty.

02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:10.700
You mentioned something about

02:22:10.700 --> 02:22:13.940
do cellular automata exist outside the human mind

02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:16.060
in our little offline conversation.

02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:18.820
Why is that an interesting question?

02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:22.460
So cellular automata, complexity,

02:22:22.460 --> 02:22:24.340
what's the relationship between complexity

02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:28.940
in the human mind and trees falling in the forest?

02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:30.540
Infrastructure, so the CA,

02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:34.060
so when John von Neumann and Conway and Feynman

02:22:34.060 --> 02:22:35.820
were doing CA, they were doing it on paper.

02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:37.180
CA is cellular automata.

02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:38.900
Just drawing them on paper.

02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:40.060
How awesome is that,

02:22:40.060 --> 02:22:42.300
that they were doing cellular automata on paper?

02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:43.140
Yeah.

02:22:43.180 --> 02:22:44.500
They were doing it on a computer

02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:48.780
that takes forever to print out anything and program.

02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:49.620
Sure.

02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:50.980
People are now with the TikTok,

02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:53.620
kids these days with the TikTok,

02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:55.220
don't understand how amazing it is

02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:57.060
to just play with cellular automata,

02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:59.980
arbitrarily changing the rules as you want

02:22:59.980 --> 02:23:00.940
to the initial conditions

02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:04.020
and see the beautiful patterns emerge,

02:23:04.020 --> 02:23:06.180
sing with fractals, all of that, just all.

02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:07.540
You've just given me a brilliant idea.

02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:08.780
I wonder if there's a TikTok account

02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:10.700
that's just dedicated to putting out CA rules,

02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:12.620
and if there isn't, we should make one.

02:23:12.620 --> 02:23:14.100
100%.

02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:14.940
And that will get.

02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:16.660
So we have millions of views.

02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:17.740
Millions, yes.

02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:20.260
No, it'll get dozens.

02:23:20.260 --> 02:23:21.460
We'll just have them running.

02:23:21.460 --> 02:23:25.460
So look, I kind of, CA, I love CAs.

02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:28.060
Sorry.

02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:31.020
Yeah, no.

02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:31.860
We just have to make one.

02:23:31.860 --> 02:23:34.100
I actually, a few years ago,

02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:36.100
I made some robots that talk to each other,

02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:40.020
chemical robots that played the game of Hex,

02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:42.980
invented by John Nash, by doing chemistry,

02:23:42.980 --> 02:23:44.980
and they communicated via Twitter,

02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:46.540
which experiments they were doing,

02:23:46.540 --> 02:23:49.780
and they had a lookup table of experiments,

02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:51.700
and robot one said, I'm doing experiment 10,

02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:53.700
and the other robot, okay, I'll do experiment one then.

02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:55.820
And they communicated via Twitter.

02:23:55.820 --> 02:23:57.340
Publicly or DMs?

02:23:57.340 --> 02:23:58.740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:01.420
Can you maybe quickly explain what the game of Hex is?

02:24:01.420 --> 02:24:04.300
Yeah, so it's basically a hexagonal board,

02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:07.460
and you try and basically, you color each element

02:24:07.460 --> 02:24:08.860
on the board of each hexagon,

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:10.660
and you try and get from one side to the other,

02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:12.460
and the other one tries to block you.

02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:13.820
How are they connected?

02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:14.660
So what are the robots?

02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:16.740
So it's a chemical.

02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:17.580
Yeah, let's go back.

02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:20.620
So the two robots, each robot was doing die chemistry,

02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:23.020
so making RGB, red, green, blue, red, green, blue,

02:24:23.020 --> 02:24:25.340
red, green, blue, and they could just choose

02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:28.460
from experiments to do red, green, blue.

02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:29.460
Initially, I said to my group,

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:31.500
we need to make two chemical robots that play chess,

02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:33.460
and my group were like, that's too hard.

02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:35.340
No, go away.

02:24:35.340 --> 02:24:36.740
But anyways, we had the robot.

02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:41.740
By the way, people listening to this should probably know

02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:46.940
that Lee Cronin is an amazing group of brilliant people.

02:24:46.940 --> 02:24:48.860
He's exceptionally well-published.

02:24:48.860 --> 02:24:52.260
He's written a huge number of amazing papers.

02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:57.260
Whenever he calls himself stupid and is a sign of humility,

02:24:57.940 --> 02:25:00.260
and I deeply respect that and appreciate it,

02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:02.020
so people listening to this should know

02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:04.380
this is a world-class scientist

02:25:04.380 --> 02:25:05.660
who doesn't take himself seriously,

02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:07.820
which I really appreciate and love.

02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:11.780
Anywho, talking about serious science,

02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:16.020
we're back to your group rejecting your idea

02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:21.020
of chemical robots playing chess via dies,

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:24.580
so you went to a simpler game of Hex.

02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:26.340
Okay, so what else?

02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:27.740
The team that did it were brilliant.

02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:31.540
I think they still have PTSD from doing it,

02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:32.660
because I said this is a workshop.

02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:36.780
What I'd often do is I have about 60 people on my team,

02:25:36.780 --> 02:25:38.260
and occasionally before lockdown,

02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:40.340
I would say, I'm a bit bored.

02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:41.660
We're gonna have a workshop on something.

02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:42.660
Who wants to come?

02:25:42.660 --> 02:25:44.820
And then basically about 20 people turn up to my office,

02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:46.740
and I say, we're gonna do this mad thing.

02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:49.380
And then it would just self-organize,

02:25:49.380 --> 02:25:51.140
and some of them would be like, no, I'm not doing this.

02:25:51.140 --> 02:25:54.540
And then you get left with the happy dozen.

02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:56.100
And what we did is we built this robot,

02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:57.820
and doing die chemistry is really easy.

02:25:57.820 --> 02:25:59.060
You can just take two molecules,

02:25:59.060 --> 02:26:00.900
react them together, and change color.

02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:03.100
And what I wanted to do is have a palette

02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:04.580
of different molecules.

02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:07.020
You can react combinatorially and get different colors.

02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:09.500
So you got two robots, and I went, wouldn't it be cool

02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:12.100
if the robots basically shared

02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:14.140
the same list of reactions to do?

02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:15.740
And they said, oh, and because of,

02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:18.740
then you could do a kind of multi-core chemistry.

02:26:18.740 --> 02:26:20.540
Like they weren't, so you'd have two chemical reactions

02:26:20.540 --> 02:26:22.660
going on at once, and they could basically

02:26:22.660 --> 02:26:23.740
outsource the problem.

02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:25.300
But they're sharing the same tape.

02:26:25.300 --> 02:26:27.260
Exactly, so robot one would say,

02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:28.980
I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do experiment one,

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:30.900
and the other robot says, I'll do experiment 100.

02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:32.900
And then they cross it off.

02:26:32.900 --> 02:26:33.740
But I wanted to make it-

02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:34.900
That's brilliant, by the way.

02:26:34.900 --> 02:26:35.740
I wanted to make-

02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:36.580
That is genius, sorry.

02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:38.340
Well, I wanted to make it groovier.

02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:41.180
And I said, look, let's have them competing

02:26:41.180 --> 02:26:43.780
to make, so they're playing a game of hex.

02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:46.460
And so when the robot does an experiment,

02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:48.500
and the more blue the die,

02:26:48.500 --> 02:26:51.220
the more it gets, the higher chance it gets

02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:53.500
to make the move it wants on the hex board.

02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:56.540
So if it gets a red color, it gets down-weighted

02:26:56.540 --> 02:26:57.620
than the other robot.

02:26:57.700 --> 02:26:59.380
And so what the robots could do is they play,

02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:02.340
each player move, and because the fitness function

02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:05.260
or the optimization function was to make the color blue,

02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:10.260
they started to invent reactions we weren't on the list.

02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:13.100
And they did this by not cleaning,

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:14.700
because we made cleaning optional.

02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:17.300
So when one robot realized, if it didn't clean its pipe,

02:27:17.300 --> 02:27:19.180
so it could get blue more quickly,

02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:20.340
and the other robot realized that,

02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:21.900
so it was like getting dirty as well.

02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:22.740
And they-

02:27:22.740 --> 02:27:27.220
Unintended consequences of super intelligence, okay.

02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:28.740
That was the game.

02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:29.580
And we-

02:27:29.580 --> 02:27:30.540
Communicating through Twitter though.

02:27:30.540 --> 02:27:31.820
They were doing it through Twitter,

02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:33.340
and Twitter banned them a couple of times.

02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:34.860
I said, come on, you've got a couple of robots

02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:37.260
doing chemistry, it's really cool, stop banning them.

02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:39.460
But in the end, we had to take them off Twitter,

02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:41.220
and they just communicated via a server,

02:27:41.220 --> 02:27:43.140
because it was just, there were people saying,

02:27:43.140 --> 02:27:46.140
you can still find it, CroninLab1 and CroninLab2

02:27:46.140 --> 02:27:49.140
on Twitter, and it was like, make move, wait,

02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:53.420
mix A and B, wait 10 seconds, answer blue.

02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:56.100
I really find it super compelling

02:27:56.100 --> 02:27:59.660
that you would have a chemical entity

02:28:00.700 --> 02:28:03.140
that's communicating with the world.

02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:03.980
That was one of the things I wanna do

02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:05.900
with my origin of life reaction, right,

02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:10.860
is basically have a reactor that's basically

02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:12.860
just randomly enumerating through chemical space

02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:14.740
and have some kind of cycle,

02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:17.220
and then read out what the molecule's reading out

02:28:17.220 --> 02:28:18.780
using a mass spectrometer,

02:28:18.780 --> 02:28:22.420
and then convert that to text, and publish it on Twitter,

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:24.260
and then wait until it says I'm alive.

02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:29.180
I reckon that Twitter account would get a lot of followers,

02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:30.380
and I'm still trying to convince my group

02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:32.740
that we should just make an origin of life Twitter account,

02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:37.340
where it's going, and it's like, hello, testing, I'm here.

02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:39.140
Well, I'll share it, I like it,

02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:40.700
I particularly enjoy this idea

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:46.700
of a non-human entity communicating with the world

02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:48.860
via a human-designed social network.

02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:51.500
It's quite a beautiful idea.

02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:58.260
How we were talking about CAs existing outside the human mind.

02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:02.580
Yeah, so I really admire Stephen Wolfram,

02:29:02.580 --> 02:29:05.420
I think he's a genius, clearly a genius,

02:29:05.420 --> 02:29:06.420
and trapped is actually,

02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:08.260
it's like a problem with being so smart,

02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:11.580
is you get trapped in your own mind, right?

02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:14.580
And I tried to actually, I tried to convince Stephen

02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:15.860
that Sembri theory wasn't nonsense,

02:29:15.860 --> 02:29:17.820
he was like, no, it's just nonsense.

02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:18.780
I was a little bit sad by that.

02:29:18.780 --> 02:29:20.900
So nonsense applied, even if it applied

02:29:20.900 --> 02:29:22.780
to the simplest construct

02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:25.020
of a one-dimensional cellular automata, for example.

02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:26.300
Yeah, yeah, but I mean, actually,

02:29:26.300 --> 02:29:28.340
maybe I'm doing myself a bit too down.

02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:30.980
It was just as a theory was coming through

02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:33.220
and I didn't really know how to explain it.

02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:36.660
But we are gonna use Sembri theory in CAs instead of automata,

02:29:36.660 --> 02:29:40.020
but I wanted to, what I was really curious about

02:29:40.020 --> 02:29:43.820
is why people marvel, I mean, you marvel at CAs

02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:45.940
and their complexity, and I said, well, hang on,

02:29:45.940 --> 02:29:47.180
that complexity's baked in,

02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:50.500
because if you play the game of life in a CA,

02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:52.700
you have to run it on a computer.

02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:55.660
You have to have a, you have to do a number of operations,

02:29:55.660 --> 02:29:57.180
put in the boundary conditions.

02:29:57.180 --> 02:29:59.860
So is it surprising that you get this structure out?

02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:02.900
Is it manufactured by the boundary conditions?

02:30:02.900 --> 02:30:06.180
And it is interesting because I think

02:30:07.780 --> 02:30:09.340
cellular automata running them

02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:14.060
is teaching me something about what real numbers are and aren't.

02:30:14.060 --> 02:30:15.140
I haven't quite got there yet.

02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:16.820
I was playing on the airplane coming over,

02:30:16.820 --> 02:30:18.260
I'm just realized I have no idea

02:30:18.260 --> 02:30:20.060
what real numbers are really.

02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:21.820
And I was like, well, I do actually have some notion

02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:23.020
of what real numbers are.

02:30:24.220 --> 02:30:28.860
And I think thinking about real numbers as functions

02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:30.900
rather than numbers is more appropriate.

02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:33.580
And then if you then apply that to CAs,

02:30:33.580 --> 02:30:36.180
then you're saying, well, actually,

02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:39.980
why am I seeing this complexity in this rule?

02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:44.700
Is it, you know, you've got this deterministic system,

02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:48.100
and yet you get this incredible structure coming out.

02:30:48.100 --> 02:30:51.340
Well, isn't that what you'd get with any real number

02:30:51.340 --> 02:30:54.340
as you apply it as a function,

02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:57.220
and you're trying to read it out to an arbitrary precision?

02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:00.820
And I wonder if CAs are just helping me,

02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:03.580
my misunderstanding is CAs might be helping me understand them

02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:04.420
in terms of real numbers.

02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:05.260
I don't know what you think.

02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:06.340
Yeah, well, the function,

02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:10.820
but the devil's in the function.

02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:13.420
It's like, which is the function

02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:16.820
that's generating your real number?

02:31:16.900 --> 02:31:20.860
Like that, it seems like it's very important

02:31:20.860 --> 02:31:22.740
the specific algorithm of that function,

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:25.180
because some lead to something super trivial,

02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:27.340
some lead to something that's all chaotic,

02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:30.940
and some lead to things that are just walked

02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:35.420
that fine line of complexity and structure.

02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:36.260
I think we agree.

02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:37.220
So let's take it back a second.

02:31:37.220 --> 02:31:40.820
So take the logistic map or something, logistic equation,

02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:43.100
where you have this equation, which is,

02:31:44.460 --> 02:31:46.620
you don't know what's gonna happen to M plus one,

02:31:47.460 --> 02:31:48.940
but once you've done M plus one, you know full time,

02:31:48.940 --> 02:31:50.420
you can't predict it.

02:31:50.420 --> 02:31:53.220
For me, CAs and logistic equation feel similar.

02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:57.420
And I think what's incredibly interesting,

02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:02.420
and I share your kind of wonder at running a CA,

02:32:03.860 --> 02:32:05.500
but also I'm saying, well, what is it

02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:06.660
about the boundary conditions

02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:08.620
and the way I'm running that calculation?

02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:10.220
So in my group, with my team,

02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:13.100
we actually made a chemical CA, we made game of life,

02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:15.140
we actually made a physical grid.

02:32:15.140 --> 02:32:16.460
I haven't been able to publish this paper

02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:19.140
because it's been trapped in purgatory for a long time.

02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:20.180
You wrote it up as a paper,

02:32:20.180 --> 02:32:23.220
how to do a chemical formulation of the game of life.

02:32:23.220 --> 02:32:25.780
We made a chemical computer and little cells.

02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:26.940
And I was playing game of life.

02:32:26.940 --> 02:32:29.940
With a BZ reactions, each cell would pulse on and off,

02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:31.260
on and off, on and off.

02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:34.260
We have little sterobars and we have little gates.

02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:37.260
And we actually played Conway's game of life in there.

02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:38.860
And we got structures in that,

02:32:38.860 --> 02:32:41.900
we got structures in that game from the chemistry

02:32:41.900 --> 02:32:44.300
that you wouldn't expect from the actual CA.

02:32:44.340 --> 02:32:46.500
So that's kind of cool in that.

02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:50.420
Cause they're interacting outside of the cells more.

02:32:50.420 --> 02:32:52.180
So what's happening is you're getting noise.

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:55.420
So the thing is that you've got this BZ reaction

02:32:55.420 --> 02:32:56.900
and it gives on off, on off, on off,

02:32:56.900 --> 02:32:58.820
but there's also a wake

02:32:58.820 --> 02:33:01.460
and those wakes constructively interfere

02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:06.460
and in such a non-trivial way that's non-deterministic

02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:11.020
and the non-determinism in the system

02:33:11.020 --> 02:33:12.740
gives very rich dynamics.

02:33:12.740 --> 02:33:14.020
And I was wondering if I could physically

02:33:14.020 --> 02:33:16.980
make a chemical computer with this CA

02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:20.180
that gives me something different

02:33:20.180 --> 02:33:25.180
that I can't get in a silicon representation of a CA

02:33:25.420 --> 02:33:27.140
where all the states are clean.

02:33:27.140 --> 02:33:29.060
Cause you don't have the noise

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:30.700
trailing into the next round.

02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:32.140
You just have the state.

02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:33.780
So the paper in particular,

02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:37.060
so it's just a beautiful idea to use a chemical computer

02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:39.300
to construct a cellular automaton,

02:33:39.300 --> 02:33:41.300
the famous one of game of life.

02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:42.340
But it's also interesting

02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:45.820
and it's a really interesting scientific question

02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:48.420
of whether some kind of random perturbations

02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:51.140
or some source of randomness

02:33:51.140 --> 02:33:56.140
can have a significant constructive effect

02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:00.340
on the complexity of the system.

02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:03.140
And indeed, I mean, whether it's random

02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:04.740
or just non-deterministic

02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:08.140
and can we bake in that non-determinism at the beginning?

02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:10.580
You know, I wonder what is the,

02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:12.540
I'm trying to think about what is the encoding space.

02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:14.300
Encoding space is pretty big.

02:34:14.300 --> 02:34:19.300
We have 49 star, so 49 cells, 49 chem bits,

02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:23.740
all connected to one another in like an analog computer,

02:34:23.740 --> 02:34:27.020
but being read out discreetly as the BZ reaction.

02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:30.300
So just to say the BZ reaction is a chemical oscillator.

02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:31.460
And what happened in each cell

02:34:31.460 --> 02:34:33.100
is it goes between red and blue.

02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:36.420
So two Russians discovered it, Belousov-Zapiskinsky.

02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:38.500
I think Belousov first proposed it

02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:39.540
and everyone said, you're crazy.

02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:40.740
It breaks the second law.

02:34:40.740 --> 02:34:42.780
And Zapisinsky said, no, it doesn't break the second law.

02:34:42.780 --> 02:34:44.100
It's consuming a fuel.

02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:47.580
And so, and then, and it's like,

02:34:47.580 --> 02:34:50.340
there's a lot of chemistry hidden

02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:51.980
in the Russian literature actually.

02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:54.740
That just because the Russians just wrote it in Russian,

02:34:54.740 --> 02:34:56.580
they didn't publish it in English-speaking journals.

02:34:56.580 --> 02:34:57.580
It's heartbreaking actually.

02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:01.700
Well, it's sad and it's great that it's there, right?

02:35:01.700 --> 02:35:02.540
It's not lost.

02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:05.100
I'm sure we will find a way of translating it properly.

02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:08.780
Well, the silver lining slash greater sadness

02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:11.220
of all of this is there's probably ideas

02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:12.900
in English-speaking,

02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:16.220
like there's ideas in certain disciplines

02:35:16.220 --> 02:35:20.140
that if discovered by other disciplines

02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:22.380
would crack open some of the biggest mysteries

02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:23.620
in those disciplines.

02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:26.340
Like computer science, for example,

02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:30.140
is trying to solve problems

02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:32.860
like nobody else has ever tried to solve problems.

02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:35.540
As if it's not already been all addressed

02:35:35.540 --> 02:35:38.540
in cognitive science, in psychology, in mathematics,

02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:42.900
in physics, in just whatever you want, economics even.

02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:44.700
But if you look into that literature,

02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:47.660
you might be able to discover some beautiful ideas.

02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:51.260
Obviously, Russian is an interesting case of this

02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:53.500
because there's a Lawson translation.

02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:57.460
But you said there's a source of fuel, a source of energy.

02:35:57.460 --> 02:35:59.220
Yeah, yeah, so the BZ reaction,

02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:02.540
you have an acid in there called melonic acid.

02:36:02.540 --> 02:36:07.300
And what happens is it's basically like a battery

02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:10.700
that powers it and it loses CO2, so decarboxylates.

02:36:10.700 --> 02:36:12.060
It's just a chemical reaction.

02:36:12.060 --> 02:36:14.500
What that means we have to do is continuously feed

02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:16.540
or we just keep the BZ reaction going

02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:21.100
in a long enough time so it's like it's reversible in time.

02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:24.260
But only like, yeah.

02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:26.380
But only like, but it's fascinating.

02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:27.700
I mean, the team that did it,

02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:29.700
I'm really proud of their persistence.

02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:32.220
We made a chemical computer.

02:36:33.300 --> 02:36:34.420
It can solve little problems.

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:36.340
It can solve traveling salesman problems, actually.

02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:37.820
Nice.

02:36:37.820 --> 02:36:38.660
But like I say, it's...

02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:41.020
But not any faster than the regular computer.

02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.180
Is there something you could do?

02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:45.060
Maybe, I'm not sure.

02:36:46.220 --> 02:36:49.780
I think we can come up with a way of solving problems,

02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:52.100
also really complex, hard ones,

02:36:54.180 --> 02:36:55.540
because it's an analog computer

02:36:55.540 --> 02:36:59.620
and it can energy minimize really quickly.

02:37:00.540 --> 02:37:02.380
It doesn't have to basically go through every element

02:37:02.380 --> 02:37:05.460
in the matrix, like flip it, it just reads out.

02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:10.460
So we can actually do Monte Carlo by just shaking the box.

02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:12.060
It's literally a box shaker.

02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:14.900
You don't actually have to encode the shaking of the box

02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:17.500
in a silicon memory and then just shuffle everything around.

02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:18.340
Yeah, and you can...

02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:19.660
It's analog, it's natural.

02:37:19.660 --> 02:37:23.460
So it's an organic computer.

02:37:23.460 --> 02:37:25.900
Yeah, so I was playing around with this

02:37:25.900 --> 02:37:27.500
and I was kind of annoying some of my colleagues.

02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.820
I'm wondering if we can get to chemical supremacy,

02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:31.500
like quantum supremacy.

02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:36.020
And I kind of calculated how big the grid has to be

02:37:36.020 --> 02:37:37.820
so we can actually start to solve problems

02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:40.060
faster than the silicon computer.

02:37:40.060 --> 02:37:43.300
But I'm not willing to state how that is yet

02:37:43.300 --> 02:37:44.780
because I'm probably wrong.

02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:47.460
It's not that it's any top secret thing.

02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:49.460
I think I can make a chemical computer

02:37:49.460 --> 02:37:51.420
that can solve optimization problems

02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:53.100
faster than the silicon computer.

02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:55.580
That's fascinating.

02:37:55.620 --> 02:37:57.900
But then you're unsure how big that has to be.

02:37:57.900 --> 02:37:58.740
Yeah, I think...

02:37:58.740 --> 02:38:00.900
It might be a big box, hard to shake.

02:38:00.900 --> 02:38:03.060
It might be exactly a big box, hard to shake

02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:05.140
and basically a bit sloppy.

02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:08.220
Did we answer the question about

02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:11.260
do cellular automata exist outside the mind?

02:38:11.260 --> 02:38:14.380
We didn't, but I would posit that they don't.

02:38:15.980 --> 02:38:17.740
But I think minds can, well...

02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:19.820
So the mind is fundamental.

02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:21.300
What's the, why?

02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:23.220
Well, I mean, sorry, let's just go to the back.

02:38:23.220 --> 02:38:25.020
So as a physical phenomena,

02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:28.540
do CAs exist in physical reality, right?

02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:30.820
I would say they probably don't exist

02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:32.020
outside the human mind,

02:38:32.020 --> 02:38:32.980
but now we've constructed them,

02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:34.700
they exist in computer memories,

02:38:34.700 --> 02:38:36.980
they exist in my lab, they exist on paper.

02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:40.700
So they are, they emerge from the human mind.

02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:41.940
I'm just interested in,

02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:43.900
because Stephen Wolfram likes CAs,

02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:45.020
a lot of people like CAs

02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:46.380
and likes to think of them

02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:49.380
as minimal computational elements.

02:38:49.380 --> 02:38:52.020
I'm just saying, well, do they exist in reality

02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:54.300
or are they a representation of a simple machine

02:38:54.300 --> 02:38:56.260
that's just very elegant to implement?

02:38:57.540 --> 02:38:59.100
So it's a platonic question, I guess.

02:38:59.100 --> 02:38:59.940
Yeah.

02:38:59.940 --> 02:39:03.180
I mean, it's, there's initial conditions,

02:39:03.180 --> 02:39:05.340
there's a memory in the system,

02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:06.460
there are simple rules

02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:09.100
that dictate the evolution of the system.

02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:10.980
So what exists?

02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:12.820
The idea, the rules, the...

02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:14.820
Yeah, people are using CAs

02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:16.820
as models for things in reality

02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:21.660
to say, hey, look, you can do this thing in a CA.

02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:24.460
When I see this, I'm saying, oh, that's cool,

02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:26.020
but what does that tell me about reality?

02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:27.540
Where's the CA in space-time?

02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:28.380
Oh, I see.

02:39:28.380 --> 02:39:29.220
Well, right.

02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:30.460
It's a mathematical object.

02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:32.940
So for people who don't know cellular automata,

02:39:32.940 --> 02:39:34.540
there's usually a grid,

02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:36.020
whether it's one-dimensional, two-dimensional

02:39:36.020 --> 02:39:36.860
or three-dimensional,

02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:39.340
and it evolves by simple local rules,

02:39:39.340 --> 02:39:40.940
like you die or are born

02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:44.340
if the neighbors are alive or dead.

02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:46.700
And it turns out if you have,

02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:49.100
with certain kinds of initial conditions

02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:50.660
and with certain kinds of very simple rules,

02:39:50.660 --> 02:39:54.060
you can create arbitrarily complex

02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:55.100
and beautiful systems.

02:39:55.100 --> 02:40:01.060
And to me, whether drugs are involved or not,

02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:03.220
I can sit back for hours

02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:07.060
and enjoy the mystery of it,

02:40:07.060 --> 02:40:10.780
how such complexity can emerge as it gives me,

02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:14.260
almost like, people talk about religious experiences,

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:19.460
it gives me a sense that you get to have a glimpse

02:40:20.300 --> 02:40:23.620
at the origin of this whole thing.

02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:28.620
Whatever is creating this complexity

02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:31.660
from such simplicity is the very thing

02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:34.940
that brought my mind to life,

02:40:34.940 --> 02:40:39.940
this me, the human, our human civilization.

02:40:40.420 --> 02:40:45.420
And yes, those constructs are pretty trivial.

02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:48.380
I mean, that's part of their magic,

02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:51.860
is even in this trivial framework,

02:40:51.860 --> 02:40:54.020
you could see the emergence,

02:40:54.020 --> 02:40:56.300
or especially in this trivial framework,

02:40:56.300 --> 02:40:59.260
you could see the emergence of complexity from simplicity.

02:40:59.260 --> 02:41:03.260
I guess what Lee, you're saying is that this is not,

02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:08.780
this is high complexity,

02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:13.100
this is highly unlike systems we see in the physical world,

02:41:13.100 --> 02:41:17.340
even though they probably carry some of the same magic,

02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:18.660
like mechanistically.

02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:22.420
I mean, I'm saying that the operating system

02:41:22.420 --> 02:41:26.180
that a CA has to exist on is quite complex.

02:41:26.180 --> 02:41:28.980
And so I wonder if you're getting the complexity

02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:30.540
out of the CA from the boundary conditions

02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:33.620
of the operating system, the underlying digital computer.

02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:36.860
Oh, wow, so those are some strong words against CAs then.

02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:40.660
Not against, I mean, I'm in love with CAs as well.

02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:44.540
I'm just saying they aren't as trivial as people think,

02:41:44.540 --> 02:41:45.900
they are incredible.

02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:47.220
To get to that richness,

02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:51.020
you have to iterate billions of times,

02:41:51.020 --> 02:41:54.940
and you need a display, and you need a math co-processor,

02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:57.700
and you need a von Neumann machine

02:41:57.700 --> 02:41:58.940
based on a Turing machine

02:41:58.940 --> 02:42:01.620
with digital error correction and states.

02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:05.780
Wow, to think that for the simplicity of a grid,

02:42:05.780 --> 02:42:08.820
you're basically saying a grid is not simple.

02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:09.780
Yeah.

02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:12.820
It requires incredible complexity to bring a grid to life.

02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:13.660
Yeah.

02:42:15.260 --> 02:42:16.100
Yeah, that's it.

02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:17.380
Well, then what is simple?

02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:18.420
That's all I wanted to say.

02:42:18.420 --> 02:42:20.460
I agree with you with the wonder of CAs, I just think,

02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:22.980
but remember, we take so much for granted

02:42:22.980 --> 02:42:24.820
what the CA is resting on,

02:42:24.820 --> 02:42:28.340
because von Neumann and Feynman weren't showing,

02:42:28.340 --> 02:42:30.020
weren't seeing these elaborate structures,

02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:31.460
they could not get that far.

02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:34.940
Yeah, but that's the limitation of their mind.

02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:37.420
Yeah, yeah, exactly, the limitation of their pencil.

02:42:37.420 --> 02:42:40.700
But I think that's, the question is

02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:44.180
whether the essential elements of the cellular automata

02:42:47.300 --> 02:42:50.860
is present without all the complexities

02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:52.460
required to build a computer.

02:42:52.460 --> 02:42:56.100
And my intuition, the reason I find it incredible

02:42:56.100 --> 02:42:58.340
is that, yeah, my intuition is yes,

02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:00.860
it might look different,

02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:05.180
there might not be a grid-like structure,

02:43:05.180 --> 02:43:09.780
but local interactions operating under simple rules

02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:14.620
and resulting in multi-hierarchical complex structures

02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:17.980
feels like a thing that doesn't require a computer.

02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:20.100
I agree, but coming back to von Neumann

02:43:20.100 --> 02:43:22.980
and Feynman and Wolfram,

02:43:22.980 --> 02:43:24.900
their minds, the non-trivial minds,

02:43:24.900 --> 02:43:26.620
to create those architectures and do it

02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:30.780
and to put on those state transitions

02:43:31.660 --> 02:43:32.500
and I think that's something

02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:34.540
that's really incredibly interesting

02:43:34.540 --> 02:43:38.100
that is understanding how the human mind

02:43:38.100 --> 02:43:40.740
builds those state transition machines.

02:43:41.660 --> 02:43:43.420
I could see how deeply in love

02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:45.060
with the idea of memory you are.

02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:49.740
So it's like how much of E equals MC squared

02:43:51.860 --> 02:43:56.500
is more than an equation, it has Albert Einstein in it.

02:43:57.740 --> 02:43:59.540
You're saying like you can't just say

02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:03.940
this is like the equations of physics

02:44:03.940 --> 02:44:08.940
are a really good simple capture of a physical phenomena.

02:44:10.100 --> 02:44:15.020
It is also, that equation has the memory of the humans.

02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:17.660
Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.

02:44:18.660 --> 02:44:21.460
But I don't, I don't know if you're implying this,

02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:25.060
I don't, that's a beautiful idea,

02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:27.140
but I don't know if I'm comfortable

02:44:27.140 --> 02:44:31.020
with that sort of diminishing the power of that equation.

02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:31.860
No, no, it enhances it.

02:44:31.860 --> 02:44:33.580
Because it's built on the shoulders, it enhances it.

02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:35.180
I think it enhances it, it's not,

02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:38.060
that equation is a minimal compressed representation

02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:39.340
of reality, right?

02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:43.420
We can use machine learning or Max Tegmark's AI Feynman

02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:45.060
to find lots of solutions for gravity,

02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:47.300
but isn't it wonderful that the laws that we do find

02:44:47.300 --> 02:44:49.580
are the maximally compressed representations?

02:44:50.900 --> 02:44:54.500
Yeah, but that representation, you can now give it as,

02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:56.580
I guess the universe has the memory of Einstein

02:44:56.580 --> 02:44:58.300
with that representation,

02:44:58.300 --> 02:45:00.860
but then you can now give it as a gift for free.

02:45:00.860 --> 02:45:02.100
Yeah, yeah, it's low memory.

02:45:02.100 --> 02:45:02.940
To other alien civilizations.

02:45:02.940 --> 02:45:04.180
Einstein had to go through a lot of pain together,

02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:06.460
but it's low memory, so I say that physics

02:45:06.460 --> 02:45:08.740
and chemistry and biology are the same discipline.

02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:11.780
They're just physics, laws in physics,

02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:13.340
there's no such thing as a law in physics,

02:45:13.340 --> 02:45:15.540
it's just low memory stuff.

02:45:15.540 --> 02:45:16.900
Because you've got low memory stuff,

02:45:16.900 --> 02:45:19.780
you can, things reoccur quickly.

02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:22.100
As you build in more memory, you get to chemistry,

02:45:22.100 --> 02:45:24.020
so things become more contingent.

02:45:24.020 --> 02:45:26.180
When you get to biology, more contingent still,

02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:27.660
and then technology.

02:45:27.660 --> 02:45:28.820
So the more memory you need,

02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:31.500
the more your laws are local.

02:45:31.500 --> 02:45:34.340
That's all I'm saying, in that the less memory,

02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:36.340
the more the laws are universal, because they're not laws,

02:45:36.340 --> 02:45:37.940
they are just low memory states.

02:45:40.100 --> 02:45:42.900
We have to talk about a thing

02:45:42.900 --> 02:45:45.380
you've kind of mentioned already a bunch of times,

02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:49.660
but doing computation through chemistry,

02:45:49.660 --> 02:45:51.860
chemical-based computation.

02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:55.220
I've seen you refer to it as,

02:45:55.220 --> 02:46:00.220
in a sexy title of Kemputation, Kemputation.

02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:02.660
So what is Kemputation,

02:46:02.660 --> 02:46:06.220
and what is chemically, chemical-based computation?

02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:10.500
Okay, so Kemputation is a name I gave to the process

02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:12.980
of building a state machine

02:46:12.980 --> 02:46:15.900
to make any molecule physically in the lab.

02:46:15.900 --> 02:46:19.460
And so as a chemist, chemists make molecules by hand.

02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:22.900
And they're quite hard,

02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:25.300
the chemists have a lot of tacit knowledge,

02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:26.860
a lot of ambiguity.

02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:29.740
It's not possible to go uniformly to the literature

02:46:29.740 --> 02:46:32.460
and read a recipe to make a molecule,

02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:35.420
and then go and make it in the lab every time.

02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:37.460
Some recipes are better than others,

02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:42.460
but they all assume some knowledge.

02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:44.860
And it's not universal what that is.

02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:49.620
So it's carried from human to human,

02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:51.180
some of that implicit knowledge.

02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:53.220
And you're saying, can we remove the human from the patient?

02:46:53.220 --> 02:46:55.740
Can we program?

02:46:55.740 --> 02:46:58.660
Well, by the way, what is a state machine?

02:46:58.660 --> 02:47:01.820
So a state machine is a, I suppose,

02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:05.780
a object, either abstract or mechanical,

02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:10.580
where you can do a unit operation on it

02:47:10.580 --> 02:47:12.300
and flick it from one state to another.

02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:15.940
So a turnstile would be a good example of a state machine.

02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:17.380
There's some kinds of states

02:47:17.380 --> 02:47:19.660
and some kind of transitions between states.

02:47:19.660 --> 02:47:23.620
And it's very formal in nature

02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:25.180
in terms of how it's precise.

02:47:25.180 --> 02:47:28.100
Yes, you can mathematically precisely

02:47:28.100 --> 02:47:29.420
describe a state machine.

02:47:29.420 --> 02:47:33.140
So I mean, a very simple Boolean gates

02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:35.460
are a very good way of building

02:47:35.460 --> 02:47:37.500
kind of logic-based state machines.

02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:39.940
Obviously a Turing machine,

02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:41.460
the concept of a Turing machine

02:47:41.460 --> 02:47:43.540
where you have a tape and a read head

02:47:43.540 --> 02:47:46.180
and a series of rules in a table.

02:47:46.180 --> 02:47:49.380
And you would basically look at what's on the tape.

02:47:49.380 --> 02:47:51.620
And if you're shifting the tape from left to right,

02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:53.500
and if you see a zero or one,

02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:54.980
you look in your lookup table and say,

02:47:54.980 --> 02:47:57.420
right, I've seen a zero and a one.

02:47:57.420 --> 02:47:58.260
I then do,

02:48:00.380 --> 02:48:01.660
I then respond to that.

02:48:01.660 --> 02:48:03.700
So the turnstile would be,

02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:06.660
is there a human being pushing the turnstile

02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:09.260
in direction clockwise?

02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:11.380
If yes, I will open, let them go.

02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:13.140
If it's anti-clockwise, no.

02:48:13.140 --> 02:48:15.100
So yeah, so a state machine has some labels

02:48:15.100 --> 02:48:17.900
and a transition diagram.

02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:22.100
So you're looking to come up with a chemical computer

02:48:22.100 --> 02:48:25.540
to form state machines to create molecules?

02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:29.300
Or what's the chicken and the egg?

02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:31.460
So computation is not a chemical computer

02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:33.140
because we talked a few minutes about

02:48:33.140 --> 02:48:35.220
actually doing computations with chemicals.

02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:37.500
What I'm now saying is I want to use state machines

02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:39.620
to transform chemicals.

02:48:40.580 --> 02:48:42.700
So build chemicals programmatically.

02:48:42.700 --> 02:48:44.460
Yeah, I mean, I get in trouble saying this.

02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:46.980
I said to my group, oh, I shouldn't say it

02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:49.580
because if I said, look, we should make the crack bot,

02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:51.180
is it in the crack robot?

02:48:51.180 --> 02:48:52.020
The robot that makes crack.

02:48:52.020 --> 02:48:52.860
The crack bot?

02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:55.220
Oh, crack bot.

02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:56.420
The robot that makes crack,

02:48:56.420 --> 02:48:58.220
but maybe we should scrub this from.

02:49:00.580 --> 02:49:03.100
Or, well, so maybe you can educate me

02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:06.140
on breaking bad with like maths, right?

02:49:06.140 --> 02:49:07.580
Yeah, so in breaking bad.

02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:12.300
You want to make basically some kind of mix of

02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:15.420
ex machina and breaking bad.

02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:16.260
No, I don't.

02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:17.620
For the record, I don't.

02:49:17.620 --> 02:49:18.460
You don't.

02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:19.940
I said, that's what I'm going to do

02:49:19.940 --> 02:49:21.540
once you release the papers.

02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:28.900
I shaved my head and I'm going to live a life of crime.

02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:29.780
Anyway, I'm sorry.

02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:30.620
No, no.

02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:32.180
So yeah, let's get back to,

02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:34.500
so indeed it is about making drugs,

02:49:34.500 --> 02:49:36.660
but importantly, making important drugs.

02:49:38.020 --> 02:49:39.860
All drugs matter.

02:49:39.860 --> 02:49:41.500
Yeah, but let's go back.

02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:46.020
So the basic thesis is chemistry is very analog.

02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:47.300
There is no state machine.

02:49:48.900 --> 02:49:52.780
And I wandered into the, through the paper walls

02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:54.980
in the Japanese house a few years ago and said,

02:49:54.980 --> 02:49:58.140
okay, hey, organic chemist, why are you doing this analog?

02:49:58.140 --> 02:50:00.420
They said, well, chemistry is really hard.

02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:03.340
You can't automate it, it's impossible.

02:50:03.340 --> 02:50:05.260
I said, but is it impossible?

02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:06.100
They said, yeah.

02:50:06.940 --> 02:50:09.580
I got the impression they're saying it's magic.

02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:11.780
And so when people tell me things are magic,

02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:14.180
it's like, no, no, they can't be magic.

02:50:14.180 --> 02:50:15.700
Right, so let's break this down.

02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:19.580
And so what I did is I went to my group one day

02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:21.700
about eight years ago and said, hey guys,

02:50:21.700 --> 02:50:24.420
I've written this new programming language for you.

02:50:24.420 --> 02:50:26.700
And so everything is clear.

02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:29.580
And you're not allowed to just wander around the lab

02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:31.540
willy nilly, you have to pick up things in order,

02:50:31.540 --> 02:50:34.300
go to the balance at the right time and all this stuff.

02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:36.020
And they looked at me as if I was insane

02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:37.740
and basically kicked me out of the lab and said,

02:50:37.740 --> 02:50:39.580
no, don't do that, we're not doing that.

02:50:39.580 --> 02:50:40.420
And I said, okay.

02:50:40.420 --> 02:50:42.060
So I went back the next day and said,

02:50:43.180 --> 02:50:45.740
I'm gonna find some money so we can make cool robots

02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:46.820
to do chemical reactions.

02:50:46.820 --> 02:50:48.900
And everyone went, that's cool.

02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:51.540
And so in that process.

02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:54.140
The person tried to convert the humans to become robots

02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:57.300
and next you agree you might as well just create the robots.

02:50:57.300 --> 02:51:00.140
Yes, so in that the formalization process.

02:51:00.140 --> 02:51:02.620
Yeah, so what I did is said, look, chemical,

02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:04.940
to make a molecule, you need to do four things abstractly.

02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:07.020
I want to make a chemical Turing machine.

02:51:07.020 --> 02:51:08.780
Because a Turing machine, you think about this,

02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:10.060
imagine a Turing machine.

02:51:10.060 --> 02:51:14.580
Turing machine is the ultimate abstraction of a computation

02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:17.900
because it's been shown by Turing and others

02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:19.900
that basically a universal Turing machine

02:51:19.900 --> 02:51:23.020
should be able to do all computations that you can imagine.

02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:25.620
It's like, wow, why don't I think of a Turing machine

02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:27.900
for chemistry, let's think of a magic robot

02:51:27.900 --> 02:51:29.740
that can make any molecule.

02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:31.540
Let's think about that for a second.

02:51:31.540 --> 02:51:33.500
Okay, great, how do we then implement it?

02:51:33.500 --> 02:51:35.740
And I think, so what is the abstraction?

02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:39.260
So to make any molecule, you have to do a reaction.

02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:40.380
So you have to put reagents together,

02:51:40.380 --> 02:51:43.860
do a reaction in a flask, typically.

02:51:43.860 --> 02:51:45.860
Then after the reaction, you have to stop the reaction.

02:51:45.860 --> 02:51:47.340
So you do what's called a workup.

02:51:47.340 --> 02:51:51.540
So whatever, cool it down, add some liquid to it, extract.

02:51:51.540 --> 02:51:53.540
So then after you do the workup, you separate.

02:51:53.540 --> 02:51:55.900
So you then remove the molecules, separate them all out.

02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:58.140
And then the final step is purification.

02:51:58.140 --> 02:52:01.700
So reaction, workup, separate, purify.

02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:05.900
So this is basically exactly like a Turing machine

02:52:05.900 --> 02:52:08.300
where you have your tape, you have your tape head,

02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:10.380
you have some rules, and then you run it.

02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:11.740
So I thought, cool.

02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:12.820
I went to all the chemists and said,

02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:15.300
look, chemistry isn't that hard.

02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:18.340
Reaction, workup, separation, purification,

02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:20.940
do that in cycles, forever, for any molecule,

02:52:20.940 --> 02:52:23.180
all the chemistry, done.

02:52:23.180 --> 02:52:26.180
And they said, chemistry is that hard.

02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:28.580
I said, but just in principle.

02:52:28.580 --> 02:52:30.500
And I got a few very enlightened people to say,

02:52:30.500 --> 02:52:33.140
yeah, okay, in principle, but it ain't gonna work.

02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:36.620
And this was in about 2013, 2014.

02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:39.820
And I found myself going to an architecture conference

02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:40.820
almost by accident.

02:52:40.820 --> 02:52:42.740
It's like, why am I at this random conference

02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:44.420
on architecture?

02:52:44.420 --> 02:52:45.940
And that was because I published a paper

02:52:45.940 --> 02:52:47.860
on inorganic architecture.

02:52:47.860 --> 02:52:49.420
And they said, come to architecture conference,

02:52:49.420 --> 02:52:52.340
but the inorganic architecture is for nano architecture.

02:52:52.340 --> 02:52:53.180
And I went, okay.

02:52:53.180 --> 02:52:54.900
And then I found these guys at the conference,

02:52:54.900 --> 02:52:57.420
3D printing, ping pong balls and shapes.

02:52:57.420 --> 02:52:58.900
And this is through it, 3D printing was cool.

02:52:58.900 --> 02:53:00.500
And I was like, this is ridiculous.

02:53:00.500 --> 02:53:01.940
Why are you 3D printing ping pong balls?

02:53:01.940 --> 02:53:03.460
And I gave them a whole load of abuse,

02:53:03.460 --> 02:53:05.380
like I normally do when I first meet people,

02:53:05.380 --> 02:53:07.300
how to win friends and influence people.

02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:10.300
And then I was like, oh my God, you guys are geniuses.

02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:12.060
And so I got from, they were a bit confused

02:53:12.060 --> 02:53:13.140
because I was calling them idiots

02:53:13.140 --> 02:53:14.180
and then call them geniuses.

02:53:14.180 --> 02:53:16.180
It's like, will you come to my lab

02:53:16.180 --> 02:53:18.300
and we're gonna build a robot to do chemistry

02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:19.140
with a 3D printer?

02:53:19.140 --> 02:53:21.020
And I said, oh, that's cool, all right.

02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:22.380
So I had them come to the lab

02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:24.060
and we started to 3D print test tubes.

02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:26.820
So you imagine, 3D print a bottle

02:53:26.820 --> 02:53:30.540
and then use the same gantry to basically,

02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:34.140
rather than to squirt out a plastic out of a nozzle,

02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:36.380
have a little syringe and jump chemicals in.

02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:37.220
So we had the 3D printer,

02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:39.620
they could simultaneously print the test tube

02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:42.100
and then put chemicals into the test tube.

02:53:42.100 --> 02:53:42.940
And then-

02:53:42.940 --> 02:53:44.460
Oh, so it's really end to end.

02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:45.300
Yeah, I was like, that'll be cool

02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:47.140
because they've got G-code to do it all.

02:53:47.140 --> 02:53:48.740
I was like, that's cool.

02:53:48.740 --> 02:53:50.780
So I got my group doing this and I developed it a bit.

02:53:50.780 --> 02:53:54.620
And I realized that we could take those unit operations

02:53:54.660 --> 02:53:57.180
and we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves.

02:53:57.180 --> 02:54:00.820
And I realized that I could basically take the literature

02:54:00.820 --> 02:54:05.820
and I made the first version of the computer in 2016, 17.

02:54:05.900 --> 02:54:07.540
I made some architectural decisions.

02:54:07.540 --> 02:54:09.420
So I designed the pumps and valves in my group.

02:54:09.420 --> 02:54:10.780
I did all the electronics in my group.

02:54:10.780 --> 02:54:12.300
They were brilliant.

02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:15.900
I cannot pay tribute to my group enough in doing this.

02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:16.740
They were just brilliant.

02:54:16.740 --> 02:54:18.460
And there were some poor souls there that said,

02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:21.300
Lee, why are you making this design electronics?

02:54:21.300 --> 02:54:24.260
I'm like, well, because I don't understand it.

02:54:24.860 --> 02:54:26.060
So you're making this design stuff

02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:26.900
because you don't understand.

02:54:26.900 --> 02:54:29.700
It's like, yeah, it's like, but can we not just buy some?

02:54:29.700 --> 02:54:31.580
I said, well, we can, but then I don't understand

02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:34.540
how to, you know, what bus they're gonna use

02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:36.060
and the serial ports and all this stuff.

02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:39.060
I just wanted, and I made, I came up with a decision

02:54:39.060 --> 02:54:41.140
to design a bunch of pumps and valves

02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:42.660
and use power over ethernet.

02:54:42.660 --> 02:54:46.380
So I got one cable for power and data, plug them all in,

02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:48.100
plug them all into a router.

02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:51.380
And then I made the state machine.

02:54:51.380 --> 02:54:53.700
And there was a couple of cool things I did.

02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:54.940
Oh, they did, actually.

02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:57.180
We got the abstraction.

02:54:57.180 --> 02:55:01.620
So reaction, workup, separation, purification.

02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:06.100
And then I made the decision to do it in batch.

02:55:06.100 --> 02:55:07.940
Now it's in batch.

02:55:07.940 --> 02:55:10.660
All chemistry had been digitized before, apparently,

02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:11.860
and once it's been done.

02:55:11.860 --> 02:55:13.980
But everyone had been doing it in flow.

02:55:13.980 --> 02:55:16.260
And flow is continuous, and there are infinities everywhere.

02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:19.060
And you have to just, and I realized

02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:20.660
that I could actually make a state machine

02:55:20.740 --> 02:55:23.860
where I basically put stuff in the reactor,

02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:26.900
turn it from one state to another state,

02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:28.380
stop it, and just read it out.

02:55:28.380 --> 02:55:30.660
And okay, and I was kind of bitching

02:55:30.660 --> 02:55:32.340
at electrical engineers saying, you have it easy.

02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:34.780
You don't have to clean out the electrons, you know.

02:55:34.780 --> 02:55:36.380
Electrons don't leave a big mess.

02:55:36.380 --> 02:55:37.900
They leave some EM waste.

02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:39.780
But in my state machine, I built in cleaning.

02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:41.620
So it's like, we do an operation,

02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:43.300
then it cleans the backbone, then can do it again.

02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:44.140
So there's no-

02:55:44.140 --> 02:55:44.980
That's fascinating.

02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:47.140
So what we managed to do over a couple of years

02:55:47.140 --> 02:55:50.620
is develop the hardware, develop the state machine,

02:55:51.540 --> 02:55:52.380
and we encoded three molecules.

02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:53.340
We did three, the first three.

02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:54.740
We did nitrile, a sleeping drug,

02:55:54.740 --> 02:55:57.180
rifinamide, anti-seizure, and Viagra.

02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:59.540
You know, and I could make jokes on the paper.

02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:02.100
It's a hard problem, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:04.300
That is very good.

02:56:04.300 --> 02:56:06.420
And then in the next one, what we did is said, okay,

02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:09.500
my poor organic chemist said, look, Lee,

02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:11.220
we've worked with you this long.

02:56:11.220 --> 02:56:12.900
We've made a robot that looks like

02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:14.660
it's gonna take our jobs away.

02:56:14.660 --> 02:56:17.980
And not just take our jobs away,

02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:19.060
what we love in the lab,

02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:20.820
but now we have to become programmers,

02:56:20.820 --> 02:56:22.020
but we're not even good programmers.

02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:25.060
We just have to spend ages writing lines of code

02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:27.460
that are boring and it's not as elegant.

02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:28.860
I went, you're right.

02:56:28.860 --> 02:56:32.700
So then, but I knew because I had this abstraction

02:56:32.700 --> 02:56:34.940
and I knew that there was language,

02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:36.540
I could suddenly develop a state machine

02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:37.700
that would interpret the language,

02:56:37.700 --> 02:56:39.500
which was lossy and ambiguous,

02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:42.100
and populate my abstraction.

02:56:42.100 --> 02:56:44.300
So I built a chemical programming language

02:56:44.300 --> 02:56:46.940
that is actually gonna be recursively innumerable.

02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:48.580
It's gonna be a Turing complete language, actually,

02:56:48.580 --> 02:56:49.420
which is kind of cool,

02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:51.500
which means it's fully verifiable.

02:56:51.500 --> 02:56:55.260
So where we are now is we can now read the literature

02:56:55.260 --> 02:56:56.860
using a bit of natural language processing.

02:56:56.860 --> 02:56:57.700
It's not the best.

02:56:57.700 --> 02:56:59.500
Many other groups have done better job,

02:56:59.500 --> 02:57:01.220
but we can use that language reading

02:57:01.220 --> 02:57:04.020
to populate the state machine

02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:05.860
and basically add, subtract.

02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:08.780
We got about a number of primitives

02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:12.660
that we basically program loops

02:57:12.660 --> 02:57:14.300
that we dovetail together

02:57:14.300 --> 02:57:15.780
and we can make any molecule with it.

02:57:15.780 --> 02:57:18.220
Okay, so that's the kind of program synthesis.

02:57:18.220 --> 02:57:19.940
So you start, like literally,

02:57:19.940 --> 02:57:21.820
you talk about like a paper,

02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:24.660
like a scientific paper that's being read

02:57:24.660 --> 02:57:27.140
to natural language processing,

02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:32.140
extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions

02:57:33.380 --> 02:57:38.380
and the chemical molecules and compounds involved.

02:57:38.540 --> 02:57:43.540
And then that in GPT terms serves as a prompt

02:57:45.900 --> 02:57:47.620
for the program synthesis

02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:49.300
that's kind of trivial right now.

02:57:49.300 --> 02:57:51.220
There you have a bunch of different like for loops

02:57:51.220 --> 02:57:56.060
and so on that creates a program in this chemical language

02:57:56.060 --> 02:58:00.300
that can then be interpreted by the chemical computer,

02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:01.700
the computer.

02:58:01.700 --> 02:58:02.540
Yeah, computer.

02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:04.260
That's the word. Computer, yeah.

02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:07.860
Everything sounds better in your British accent,

02:58:07.860 --> 02:58:09.260
but I love it.

02:58:09.260 --> 02:58:12.100
So into the computer and that's able to then

02:58:13.380 --> 02:58:17.100
basically be a 3D printer for these molecules.

02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:18.460
Yeah, I wouldn't call it a 3D printer.

02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:21.060
I would call it a universal chemical reaction system

02:58:21.060 --> 02:58:22.700
because 3D printing gives the wrong impression,

02:58:22.700 --> 02:58:25.220
but yeah, and it purifies.

02:58:25.220 --> 02:58:27.660
And the nice thing is that that code now,

02:58:27.660 --> 02:58:32.580
we call it the KyDL code is really interesting

02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:36.260
because now, so computation, what is computation?

02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:41.260
Computation is what computing is to mathematics, I think.

02:58:41.380 --> 02:58:44.700
Computation is the process of taking chemical code

02:58:44.700 --> 02:58:46.380
and some input reagents

02:58:46.380 --> 02:58:51.180
and making the molecule reproducibly every time

02:58:51.180 --> 02:58:52.220
without fail.

02:58:52.220 --> 02:58:53.380
What is computation?

02:58:53.380 --> 02:58:55.580
It's the process of using a program

02:58:55.580 --> 02:58:57.780
to take some input conditions

02:58:57.780 --> 02:59:01.060
and give you an output, same every time, right?

02:59:01.060 --> 02:59:02.260
Well, reliably.

02:59:02.260 --> 02:59:05.700
So the problem is, now maybe you can push back

02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:07.500
and correct me on this.

02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:09.980
So I know biology is messy.

02:59:09.980 --> 02:59:12.420
My question is how messy is chemistry?

02:59:12.420 --> 02:59:15.660
So if we use the analogy of a computer,

02:59:15.660 --> 02:59:20.660
it's easier to make computation in a computer very precise

02:59:21.940 --> 02:59:26.220
that it's repeatable and makes errors almost never

02:59:26.220 --> 02:59:28.460
if it does the exact same way over and over

02:59:28.460 --> 02:59:29.580
and over and over.

02:59:29.580 --> 02:59:30.580
What about chemistry?

02:59:30.580 --> 02:59:32.740
Is there messiness in the whole thing?

02:59:32.740 --> 02:59:33.940
Can that be somehow leveraged?

02:59:33.940 --> 02:59:34.780
Can that be controlled?

02:59:34.780 --> 02:59:36.220
Can be that removed?

02:59:36.220 --> 02:59:38.300
Do we wanna remove it from the system?

02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:39.700
Oh, yes and no, right.

02:59:39.700 --> 02:59:40.740
Is there messiness?

02:59:42.700 --> 02:59:45.020
There is messiness because chemistry is like

02:59:45.740 --> 02:59:49.220
you're doing reactions on billions of molecules

02:59:49.220 --> 02:59:50.180
and they don't always work,

02:59:50.180 --> 02:59:52.100
but you've got purification there.

02:59:52.100 --> 02:59:54.460
And so what we've found is at the beginning,

02:59:54.460 --> 02:59:55.940
everyone said, it can't work.

02:59:55.940 --> 02:59:56.860
It's gonna be too messy.

02:59:56.860 --> 02:59:58.020
It will just fail.

02:59:58.020 --> 03:00:00.220
And I said, but you managed to get chemistry to work

03:00:00.220 --> 03:00:01.060
in the lab.

03:00:01.060 --> 03:00:01.900
Are you magic?

03:00:01.900 --> 03:00:02.740
Are you doing something?

03:00:02.740 --> 03:00:05.940
So I would say, now go back to the first ever computer

03:00:05.940 --> 03:00:09.460
or the ENIAC, 5 million soldered joints,

03:00:09.460 --> 03:00:12.780
400,000 valves that are exploding all the time.

03:00:12.780 --> 03:00:14.460
Was that, would you have gone,

03:00:15.060 --> 03:00:15.980
that's messy.

03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:21.060
Have we got the equivalent of the ENIAC in my lab?

03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:23.540
We've got 15 computers in the lab now

03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:24.940
and are they unreliable?

03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:26.940
Yeah, they fall apart here and there,

03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:29.540
but are they getting better really quickly?

03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:30.380
Yeah.

03:00:30.380 --> 03:00:32.300
Are they now able to reliably make more?

03:00:32.300 --> 03:00:33.300
Are we at the point in the lab

03:00:33.300 --> 03:00:34.780
where there are some molecules

03:00:34.780 --> 03:00:37.420
we would rather make on the computer

03:00:37.420 --> 03:00:38.500
than have a human being make?

03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:39.780
Yeah, we've just done.

03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:44.020
We've just made an anti-influenza molecule

03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:47.900
and some antivirals, six steps on the computer

03:00:47.900 --> 03:00:51.140
that would take a human being about one week

03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:54.900
to make Arbidol of continuous labor.

03:00:54.900 --> 03:00:56.180
And all they do now is load up the reagents,

03:00:56.180 --> 03:00:58.260
press go button and just go away and drink coffee.

03:00:58.260 --> 03:00:59.100
Wow.

03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:01.980
So this, I mean, and this is,

03:01:01.980 --> 03:01:04.340
you're saying this computer is just the early days.

03:01:04.340 --> 03:01:06.300
And so like some of the criticism

03:01:06.300 --> 03:01:08.100
just has to do with the early days.

03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:10.260
And yes, I would say there's something like this

03:01:10.260 --> 03:01:13.980
that is quite impossible.

03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:17.980
So the fact that you're doing this is incredible.

03:01:17.980 --> 03:01:20.820
Not impossible, of course, but extremely difficult.

03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:22.980
It did seem really difficult.

03:01:22.980 --> 03:01:25.140
And I do keep pinching myself when I go in the lab.

03:01:25.140 --> 03:01:25.980
I was like, is it working?

03:01:25.980 --> 03:01:26.820
Like, yep.

03:01:26.820 --> 03:01:29.300
And it's not, you know, it does clog.

03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:30.500
It does stop.

03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:31.420
You gotta clean.

03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:32.500
This is great.

03:01:32.500 --> 03:01:35.140
You know, but it's getting more reliable

03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:38.020
because I made some, we just made design decisions

03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:40.500
and said, we are not gonna abandon the abstraction.

03:01:40.500 --> 03:01:41.340
Think about it.

03:01:41.340 --> 03:01:45.860
If the von Neumann implementation was abandoned,

03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:47.780
I mean, think about what we do to semiconductors

03:01:47.780 --> 03:01:51.660
to really constrain them to what we do to silicon

03:01:51.660 --> 03:01:53.460
in a fab lab.

03:01:53.460 --> 03:01:55.380
We take computation for granted.

03:01:55.380 --> 03:01:57.660
Silicon is not in its natural state.

03:01:57.660 --> 03:01:58.980
We are doping the hell out of it.

03:01:58.980 --> 03:02:00.860
It's incredible what they're able to accomplish

03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:03.660
and achieve that reliability at the scale they do.

03:02:03.660 --> 03:02:07.580
Like you said, that's after Moore's law, what we have now.

03:02:07.580 --> 03:02:12.580
And where we, you know, how it started, you know.

03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:14.020
So think about it now.

03:02:14.020 --> 03:02:14.860
We started at the bottom.

03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:15.700
Now we're here.

03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:17.100
We have only have 20 million molecules,

03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:19.580
well, say 20 million molecules in one database,

03:02:19.580 --> 03:02:21.260
maybe a few hundred million

03:02:21.260 --> 03:02:23.420
in all the pharmaceutical companies.

03:02:23.420 --> 03:02:25.420
And those few hundred million molecules

03:02:25.420 --> 03:02:27.460
are responsible for all the drugs

03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:28.580
that we've had in humanity,

03:02:28.580 --> 03:02:32.300
except, you know, biologics for the last 50 years.

03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:35.500
Now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print,

03:02:35.500 --> 03:02:36.340
goes out of prints,

03:02:36.500 --> 03:02:37.460
because there's only a finite number

03:02:37.460 --> 03:02:38.780
of manufacturing facilities in the world

03:02:38.780 --> 03:02:39.620
that make these drugs.

03:02:39.620 --> 03:02:40.460
Is that a print?

03:02:40.460 --> 03:02:41.300
Yeah.

03:02:41.300 --> 03:02:42.140
Computer.

03:02:42.140 --> 03:02:42.980
This is a printing press.

03:02:42.980 --> 03:02:44.100
For chemistry.

03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:45.140
Yeah.

03:02:45.140 --> 03:02:47.500
And not only that, we can protect the CHI-DL

03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:49.140
so we can stop bad actors doing it.

03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:51.380
We can encrypt them and we can give people like-

03:02:51.380 --> 03:02:52.900
CHI-DL, that's the name, sorry to interrupt,

03:02:52.900 --> 03:02:54.580
is the name of the programming language?

03:02:54.580 --> 03:02:56.780
The CHI-DL is the name of the programming language

03:02:56.780 --> 03:02:58.580
and the code we give the chemicals.

03:02:58.580 --> 03:03:01.980
So CHI, as in, you know, just for,

03:03:01.980 --> 03:03:04.140
it's like a, it's actually like an XML format,

03:03:04.140 --> 03:03:06.500
but I've now taken it from script

03:03:06.500 --> 03:03:10.220
to a fully expressible programming language

03:03:10.220 --> 03:03:12.700
so we can do dynamics and there's four loops in there

03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:13.820
and conditional statements.

03:03:13.820 --> 03:03:14.660
Right.

03:03:14.660 --> 03:03:19.300
But the structure, it started out as like an XML thing.

03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:20.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:03:20.140 --> 03:03:21.900
And now we also, the chemist doesn't need to program

03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:23.660
in CHI-DL, they can just go to the software

03:03:23.660 --> 03:03:26.220
and type in add A to B, reflux,

03:03:26.220 --> 03:03:27.180
do what they would normally do

03:03:27.180 --> 03:03:28.500
and you just converse it to CHI-DL

03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:30.540
and they have a linter to check it and error correct.

03:03:30.540 --> 03:03:34.340
How do you, you know, not with ASCII,

03:03:34.340 --> 03:03:36.260
but because it's a Greek letter,

03:03:36.260 --> 03:03:39.740
how do you go with, how do you spell it

03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:42.300
just using the English alphabet?

03:03:42.300 --> 03:03:43.140
We just-

03:03:43.140 --> 03:03:43.980
X-D-L?

03:03:43.980 --> 03:03:46.020
X-D-L, all we use, we put in CHI.

03:03:46.020 --> 03:03:47.580
And it was named by one of my students

03:03:47.580 --> 03:03:49.940
and one of my post-docs many years ago

03:03:49.940 --> 03:03:50.980
and I quite liked it.

03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:53.500
It's like, it's important, I think,

03:03:53.500 --> 03:03:55.660
when the team are contributing to such big ideas,

03:03:55.660 --> 03:03:57.540
because there are ideas as well.

03:03:57.540 --> 03:04:00.500
I try not to just rename, I didn't call it Cronin,

03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:06.460
because they keep saying, is the chemistry,

03:04:06.580 --> 03:04:08.020
when they're putting stuff in the computer,

03:04:08.020 --> 03:04:08.860
one of my students said,

03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:10.660
we are asking that, is it Cronin complete?

03:04:10.660 --> 03:04:11.500
And I was like, what does that mean?

03:04:11.500 --> 03:04:13.900
I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine?

03:04:13.900 --> 03:04:18.420
And I was like, oh, is that a compliment or a majority?

03:04:18.420 --> 03:04:20.700
And they're like, well, it might be both.

03:04:21.700 --> 03:04:24.580
Yeah, so you tweeted, quote,

03:04:24.580 --> 03:04:25.940
why does chemistry need

03:04:25.940 --> 03:04:28.300
a universal programming language, question mark?

03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:31.860
For all the reasons you can think of,

03:04:31.860 --> 03:04:35.740
reliability, interoperability, collaboration,

03:04:35.740 --> 03:04:39.140
remove ambiguity, lower cost, increase safety,

03:04:39.140 --> 03:04:42.380
open up discovery, molecular customization,

03:04:42.380 --> 03:04:46.300
and publication of executable chemical code.

03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:51.980
Which is fascinating, by the way, just publish code.

03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:56.260
And can you maybe elaborate a little bit more

03:04:56.260 --> 03:04:57.660
about this CHI DL?

03:04:57.900 --> 03:05:01.500
What does the universal language of chemistry look like?

03:05:01.500 --> 03:05:04.820
A Cronin complete language.

03:05:04.820 --> 03:05:07.380
It's a Turing complete language, really.

03:05:07.380 --> 03:05:11.020
But so what it has, it has a series of operators in it,

03:05:11.020 --> 03:05:14.020
like add, heat, stir.

03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:17.940
So there's a bunch of just unit operations.

03:05:17.940 --> 03:05:19.660
And all it is really is just,

03:05:20.820 --> 03:05:22.740
with chemical engineers, when I talked about this,

03:05:22.740 --> 03:05:26.020
that you've just rediscovered chemical engineering.

03:05:26.020 --> 03:05:27.780
And I said, well, yeah, I know.

03:05:27.780 --> 03:05:30.140
I said, well, that's trivial.

03:05:30.140 --> 03:05:31.820
I said, well, not really.

03:05:31.820 --> 03:05:32.860
Well, yes, it is trivial.

03:05:32.860 --> 03:05:33.700
And that's why it's good,

03:05:33.700 --> 03:05:36.820
because not only have we rediscovered chemical engineering,

03:05:36.820 --> 03:05:38.940
we've made it implementable on a universal hardware

03:05:38.940 --> 03:05:40.740
that doesn't cost very much money.

03:05:40.740 --> 03:05:43.940
And so the CHI DL has a series of statements,

03:05:43.940 --> 03:05:46.140
like define the reactor.

03:05:46.140 --> 03:05:49.300
So it defines the reagents.

03:05:49.300 --> 03:05:50.660
So they're all labels.

03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:52.180
So you assign them.

03:05:52.180 --> 03:05:55.020
And what I also implemented at the beginning

03:05:55.020 --> 03:05:58.020
is because I give all the hardware an IP address,

03:05:58.020 --> 03:05:59.580
you put it on a graph.

03:05:59.580 --> 03:06:02.300
And so what it does is like the graph is equivalent

03:06:02.300 --> 03:06:06.620
to the processor firmware, the processor code.

03:06:06.620 --> 03:06:08.660
So when you take your CHI DL

03:06:08.660 --> 03:06:10.220
and you go to run it on your computer,

03:06:10.220 --> 03:06:12.100
you can run it on any compatible hardware

03:06:12.100 --> 03:06:12.940
in any configuration.

03:06:12.940 --> 03:06:14.820
It says, what's your graph look like?

03:06:14.820 --> 03:06:17.020
As long as I can solve the problem on the graph

03:06:17.020 --> 03:06:18.100
with these unit operations,

03:06:18.100 --> 03:06:21.620
you have the resources available, chem piles.

03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:22.580
Ah ha.

03:06:25.580 --> 03:06:27.060
All right, we can carry on for years.

03:06:27.060 --> 03:06:29.060
I mean, it is really, it's chempilation.

03:06:29.060 --> 03:06:31.900
And what it now does is it says,

03:06:31.900 --> 03:06:34.460
okay, the problem we have before is

03:06:34.460 --> 03:06:37.780
it was possible to do robotics for chemistry,

03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:39.420
but the robots are really expensive.

03:06:39.420 --> 03:06:40.580
They were unique.

03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:42.780
They were vendor locked.

03:06:42.780 --> 03:06:44.500
And what I want to do is to make sure

03:06:44.500 --> 03:06:45.980
that every chemist in the world

03:06:45.980 --> 03:06:49.900
can get access to machinery like this at virtually no cost,

03:06:49.900 --> 03:06:51.780
because it makes it safer.

03:06:51.780 --> 03:06:53.700
It makes it more reliable.

03:06:53.700 --> 03:06:55.260
And then if you go to literature

03:06:55.260 --> 03:06:58.340
and you find a molecule that could potentially cure cancer,

03:06:58.340 --> 03:07:00.380
and let's say the molecule that could potentially cure cancer

03:07:00.380 --> 03:07:02.980
takes you three years to repeat,

03:07:02.980 --> 03:07:06.540
and maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time

03:07:06.540 --> 03:07:07.860
and they never get it back.

03:07:09.940 --> 03:07:12.740
So it's really hard to kind of get all the way

03:07:12.740 --> 03:07:13.580
to that molecule,

03:07:13.580 --> 03:07:16.420
and it limits the ability of humanity to build on it.

03:07:16.420 --> 03:07:19.020
If they just download the code and can execute it,

03:07:19.020 --> 03:07:20.860
it turns, I would say,

03:07:20.860 --> 03:07:23.180
the electronic laboratory notebook in chemistry

03:07:23.180 --> 03:07:25.260
is a data symmetry,

03:07:26.420 --> 03:07:28.580
because no one will ever reproduce it.

03:07:28.580 --> 03:07:30.900
But now the data symmetry is a Jupiter notebook,

03:07:30.900 --> 03:07:31.740
and you can just execute it.

03:07:31.740 --> 03:07:33.580
A notebook and people can play with it.

03:07:33.580 --> 03:07:37.860
The access to it, orders of magnitude is increased.

03:07:37.860 --> 03:07:41.460
We'll talk about the, so as with all technologies,

03:07:41.460 --> 03:07:43.780
I think there's way more exciting possibilities,

03:07:43.780 --> 03:07:45.660
but there are also terrifying possibilities,

03:07:45.660 --> 03:07:47.420
and we'll talk about all of them.

03:07:47.420 --> 03:07:49.500
But let me just kind of linger

03:07:49.500 --> 03:07:51.420
on the machine learning side of this.

03:07:51.420 --> 03:07:53.460
So you're describing programming,

03:07:53.460 --> 03:07:56.380
but it's a language.

03:07:56.380 --> 03:07:58.820
I don't know if you've heard about OpenAI Codex,

03:07:58.820 --> 03:07:59.660
which is-

03:07:59.660 --> 03:08:00.660
Yeah, I'm playing with it.

03:08:00.660 --> 03:08:01.500
You're playing with it?

03:08:01.500 --> 03:08:02.580
Of course you are.

03:08:02.580 --> 03:08:07.980
You really are Rick from Rick and Morty.

03:08:07.980 --> 03:08:08.820
This is great.

03:08:08.820 --> 03:08:09.660
Okay.

03:08:10.860 --> 03:08:12.140
Except philosophically deep.

03:08:12.140 --> 03:08:14.980
I mean, he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too.

03:08:14.980 --> 03:08:16.540
So for people who don't know,

03:08:16.580 --> 03:08:20.300
GPT, GPT-3, it's a language model

03:08:20.300 --> 03:08:22.740
that can do natural language generation.

03:08:22.740 --> 03:08:23.940
So you can give it a prompt

03:08:23.940 --> 03:08:26.460
and it can complete the rest of it.

03:08:26.460 --> 03:08:28.980
But it turns out that that kind of prompt,

03:08:28.980 --> 03:08:32.020
it's not just completes the rest of this generating

03:08:34.620 --> 03:08:36.460
like novel sounding text.

03:08:36.460 --> 03:08:38.300
And then you can apply that to generation

03:08:38.300 --> 03:08:40.740
of other kinds of stuff.

03:08:40.740 --> 03:08:43.940
So these kinds of transformer based language models

03:08:43.940 --> 03:08:48.940
are really good at forming deep representations

03:08:49.780 --> 03:08:54.460
of a particular space, like a medium, like language.

03:08:54.460 --> 03:08:55.300
So you can then apply it

03:08:55.300 --> 03:08:58.420
to a specific subset of language like programming.

03:08:58.420 --> 03:09:01.740
So you can have it learn the representation

03:09:01.740 --> 03:09:03.220
of the Python programming language

03:09:03.220 --> 03:09:06.620
and use it to then generate syntactically

03:09:06.620 --> 03:09:10.500
and semantically correct programs.

03:09:10.500 --> 03:09:12.180
So you can start to make progress

03:09:12.180 --> 03:09:14.820
on one of the hardest problems in computer science,

03:09:14.820 --> 03:09:16.100
which is program synthesis.

03:09:16.100 --> 03:09:19.660
How do you write programs that accomplish different tasks?

03:09:19.660 --> 03:09:23.220
So what OpenAI Codex does

03:09:23.220 --> 03:09:25.860
is it to generate those programs

03:09:25.860 --> 03:09:28.740
based on a prompt of some kind.

03:09:28.740 --> 03:09:30.820
Usually you can do a natural language prompt.

03:09:30.820 --> 03:09:32.820
So basically, as you do when you program,

03:09:32.820 --> 03:09:35.700
you write some comment,

03:09:35.700 --> 03:09:38.020
which serves the basic documentation

03:09:38.020 --> 03:09:39.540
of the inputs and the outputs

03:09:39.540 --> 03:09:41.260
and the function of the particular set of code

03:09:41.260 --> 03:09:43.300
and it's able to generate that.

03:09:43.300 --> 03:09:45.820
Point being is you can generate programs

03:09:46.780 --> 03:09:49.660
using machine learning, using neural networks.

03:09:51.140 --> 03:09:56.140
Those programs operate on the boring old computer.

03:09:56.980 --> 03:09:59.580
Can you generate programs that operate,

03:09:59.580 --> 03:10:01.700
there's gotta be a clever version of programs for this,

03:10:01.700 --> 03:10:06.460
but can you write programs that operate on a computer?

03:10:06.460 --> 03:10:08.780
Yep, there's actually software out there right now.

03:10:08.780 --> 03:10:10.340
You can go and do it.

03:10:11.100 --> 03:10:14.300
Yeah, yeah, it's a heuristic, it's rule-based,

03:10:14.300 --> 03:10:19.300
but we have, what we've done, inspired by Codex actually,

03:10:20.340 --> 03:10:23.540
is over the summer, I ran a little workshop.

03:10:23.540 --> 03:10:25.140
Some of my groups got this inspired idea

03:10:25.140 --> 03:10:28.060
that we should get a load of students

03:10:28.060 --> 03:10:30.660
and ask them to manually collect data

03:10:30.660 --> 03:10:34.180
to label chemical procedures into KyDL.

03:10:35.220 --> 03:10:38.820
And we have a course synth reader.

03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:41.940
So there's a bunch of people doing this right now,

03:10:41.940 --> 03:10:45.140
but they're doing it without abstraction.

03:10:46.140 --> 03:10:47.460
And because we have an abstraction

03:10:47.460 --> 03:10:50.260
that's implementable in the hardware,

03:10:50.260 --> 03:10:54.500
we've developed basically a chemical analog of Codex.

03:10:55.500 --> 03:10:56.900
When you say, sorry, Jintra,

03:10:56.900 --> 03:10:59.300
when you say abstraction in the hardware,

03:10:59.300 --> 03:11:00.140
what do you mean?

03:11:00.140 --> 03:11:01.780
So right now, a lot of people doing machine learning

03:11:01.780 --> 03:11:04.420
and reading chemistry and saying,

03:11:04.420 --> 03:11:05.980
oh, you've got all these operations,

03:11:05.980 --> 03:11:07.900
add, shake, whatever, heat.

03:11:08.540 --> 03:11:11.260
But because they don't have a uniform,

03:11:11.260 --> 03:11:12.820
I mean, there's a couple of groups doing it,

03:11:12.820 --> 03:11:15.660
competitors, actually, and they're good, very good,

03:11:15.660 --> 03:11:20.500
but they can't run that code automatically.

03:11:20.500 --> 03:11:23.700
They are losing meaning.

03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:28.300
And the really important thing that you have to do

03:11:28.300 --> 03:11:29.980
is generate context.

03:11:29.980 --> 03:11:32.780
And so what we've learned to do with our abstraction

03:11:32.780 --> 03:11:36.420
is make sure we can pull the context out of the text.

03:11:36.420 --> 03:11:40.500
And so can we take a chemical procedure

03:11:40.500 --> 03:11:42.820
and read it and generate our executable code?

03:11:42.820 --> 03:11:43.940
Yes.

03:11:43.940 --> 03:11:45.980
What's the hardest part about that whole pipeline

03:11:45.980 --> 03:11:47.060
from the initial text,

03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:49.340
interpreting the initial text of a paper,

03:11:49.340 --> 03:11:52.260
extracting the meaningful context

03:11:52.260 --> 03:11:54.380
and the meaningful chemical information

03:11:54.380 --> 03:11:56.780
to then generating the program

03:11:56.780 --> 03:12:00.300
to then running that program in the hardware.

03:12:00.300 --> 03:12:02.340
What's the hardest part about that pipeline

03:12:02.340 --> 03:12:05.780
as we look towards a universal Turing computer?

03:12:05.780 --> 03:12:10.580
So the hardest thing with the pipeline

03:12:10.580 --> 03:12:15.580
is that the software, the model gets confused

03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:18.300
between some meanings, right?

03:12:18.300 --> 03:12:21.700
So if chemists are very good at inventing words

03:12:21.700 --> 03:12:22.860
that aren't broken down,

03:12:22.860 --> 03:12:25.980
so I would, the classic word that you would use

03:12:25.980 --> 03:12:28.220
for boiling something is called reflux.

03:12:28.220 --> 03:12:31.020
So reflux is, you would have a solvent

03:12:31.020 --> 03:12:33.700
in a round-bottom flask, at reflux it would be boiling,

03:12:33.700 --> 03:12:35.980
going up the reflux condenser and coming down.

03:12:35.980 --> 03:12:40.180
But that term reflux, two reflux could be changed

03:12:40.180 --> 03:12:44.300
to people often make up words, new words,

03:12:44.300 --> 03:12:47.340
and then the software can fall over.

03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:50.940
But what we've been able to do is a bit like in Python

03:12:50.940 --> 03:12:52.500
or any programming language

03:12:52.500 --> 03:12:55.100
is identify when things aren't matched.

03:12:55.100 --> 03:12:57.340
So you present the code and you say, this isn't matched.

03:12:57.340 --> 03:12:58.540
You may want to think about this.

03:12:58.540 --> 03:13:01.100
And then the user goes and says, oh, I mean reflux

03:13:01.100 --> 03:13:02.660
and just ticks a box and collects it.

03:13:02.660 --> 03:13:07.660
So what the codex or the ChemEx does in this case,

03:13:08.540 --> 03:13:12.500
is it just, it suggests the first go

03:13:12.500 --> 03:13:14.140
and then the chemist goes in and corrects it.

03:13:14.140 --> 03:13:16.260
And I really want the chemist to correct it

03:13:16.260 --> 03:13:21.260
because it's not safe, I believe, for it to allow AI

03:13:22.020 --> 03:13:25.100
to just read literature and generate code at this stage.

03:13:25.100 --> 03:13:29.180
Because now you're having actual, by the way, ChemEx, nice.

03:13:29.940 --> 03:13:31.980
Nice name.

03:13:33.540 --> 03:13:38.020
So you are unlike, which is fascinating.

03:13:39.220 --> 03:13:42.340
We live in a fascinating moment in human history.

03:13:42.340 --> 03:13:47.020
But yes, you're literally connecting AI

03:13:47.020 --> 03:13:52.020
to some physical and like it's building something

03:13:52.140 --> 03:13:56.300
in the physical realm, especially in the space of chemistry

03:13:57.140 --> 03:14:02.140
that operates sort of invisibly.

03:14:02.660 --> 03:14:05.500
Yeah, yeah, I would say that's right.

03:14:05.500 --> 03:14:07.460
And it's really important to understand

03:14:07.460 --> 03:14:09.300
those labeling schemes, right?

03:14:09.300 --> 03:14:11.340
And one of the things I was never,

03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:12.700
I was always worried about at the beginning

03:14:12.700 --> 03:14:15.260
that the abstraction was gonna fall over.

03:14:15.260 --> 03:14:18.340
And the way we did it was just by brute force to start with.

03:14:18.340 --> 03:14:19.900
We just kept reading the literature and saying,

03:14:19.900 --> 03:14:20.740
is there anything new?

03:14:20.740 --> 03:14:21.900
Can we add a new rule in?

03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:25.380
And actually our KIDL language expand exploded.

03:14:25.420 --> 03:14:28.180
There was so many extra things we had to keep adding.

03:14:28.180 --> 03:14:31.180
And then I realized the primitives still were maintained

03:14:31.180 --> 03:14:32.700
and I could break them down again.

03:14:32.700 --> 03:14:35.140
So it's pretty good.

03:14:35.140 --> 03:14:36.140
I mean, there are problems.

03:14:36.140 --> 03:14:38.540
There are problems of interpreting any big sentence

03:14:38.540 --> 03:14:40.740
and turning it into an actionable code.

03:14:40.740 --> 03:14:42.700
And then Codex is not without its problems.

03:14:42.700 --> 03:14:44.140
You can crash it quite easily, right?

03:14:44.140 --> 03:14:45.580
You can generate nonsense.

03:14:45.580 --> 03:14:47.700
But boy, it's interesting.

03:14:47.700 --> 03:14:52.700
I would love to learn to program now using Codex, right?

03:14:52.820 --> 03:14:54.220
Just hacking around, right?

03:14:54.220 --> 03:14:55.980
And I wonder if chemists in the future will learn

03:14:55.980 --> 03:15:00.140
to do chemistry by just hacking around

03:15:00.140 --> 03:15:02.180
with the system writing different things.

03:15:02.180 --> 03:15:04.340
Because the key thing that we're doing with chemistry

03:15:04.340 --> 03:15:07.260
is that where a lot of mathematical chemistry went wrong

03:15:07.260 --> 03:15:11.580
is people, and I think Wolfram does this in Mathematica.

03:15:11.580 --> 03:15:15.700
He assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom A

03:15:15.700 --> 03:15:18.260
or molecule A reacts with molecule B to give molecule C.

03:15:18.260 --> 03:15:20.500
That's not what chemistry is.

03:15:20.500 --> 03:15:23.140
Chemistry is take some molecule,

03:15:23.140 --> 03:15:26.740
take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it

03:15:27.780 --> 03:15:29.420
and then extract it.

03:15:29.420 --> 03:15:32.580
So the programming language is actually with respect

03:15:32.580 --> 03:15:35.420
to the process operations.

03:15:35.420 --> 03:15:37.820
And if you flick in process space,

03:15:37.820 --> 03:15:41.540
not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything

03:15:41.540 --> 03:15:43.260
because there's only a finite number of processes

03:15:43.260 --> 03:15:45.180
you need to do in chemistry.

03:15:45.180 --> 03:15:47.260
And that's reassuring.

03:15:47.260 --> 03:15:49.100
And so we're in the middle of it.

03:15:49.100 --> 03:15:50.460
It's really exciting.

03:15:51.620 --> 03:15:53.620
It's not the be all and the end all.

03:15:53.620 --> 03:15:55.820
And there is, like I say, errors that can creep in.

03:15:55.820 --> 03:15:57.460
One day we might be able to do it

03:15:57.460 --> 03:15:59.380
without human interaction, you simulate it.

03:15:59.380 --> 03:16:01.500
And you'll know enough about the simulation

03:16:01.500 --> 03:16:05.420
that the lab won't catch fire.

03:16:05.420 --> 03:16:07.060
But there are so many safety issues right now

03:16:07.060 --> 03:16:09.740
that we've got to really be very careful,

03:16:09.740 --> 03:16:11.940
protecting the user, protecting the environment,

03:16:11.940 --> 03:16:13.060
protecting misuse.

03:16:13.060 --> 03:16:14.900
I mean, there's lots to discuss

03:16:14.900 --> 03:16:16.100
if you want to go down that route

03:16:16.100 --> 03:16:17.620
because it's very, very interesting.

03:16:17.620 --> 03:16:20.580
You don't want Novichok being made

03:16:20.580 --> 03:16:23.660
or explosives being made

03:16:23.660 --> 03:16:26.340
or recreational drugs being made.

03:16:26.340 --> 03:16:28.620
But how do you stop a molecular biologist

03:16:28.620 --> 03:16:31.460
making a drug that's gonna be important

03:16:31.460 --> 03:16:35.260
for them looking at their particular assay

03:16:35.260 --> 03:16:38.940
on a bad actor trying to make methamphetamine?

03:16:38.940 --> 03:16:41.100
I saw how you looked at me when you said bad actor,

03:16:41.100 --> 03:16:42.940
but that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

03:16:42.940 --> 03:16:45.460
I'm trying to get the details of this so I can be first.

03:16:45.460 --> 03:16:47.460
Don't worry, we can protect you from yourself.

03:16:48.300 --> 03:16:51.340
Okay, I'm not sure that's true,

03:16:51.340 --> 03:16:54.060
but that statement gives me hope.

03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:59.060
Does this ultimately excite you about the future

03:17:00.660 --> 03:17:01.980
or does it terrify you?

03:17:01.980 --> 03:17:06.980
So we mentioned that time is fundamental.

03:17:07.100 --> 03:17:12.100
It seems like you're at the cutting edge of progress

03:17:12.460 --> 03:17:15.780
that will have to happen, that will happen,

03:17:15.780 --> 03:17:17.380
that there's no stopping it.

03:17:18.660 --> 03:17:20.820
And as we've been talking about,

03:17:20.820 --> 03:17:24.660
I see obviously a huge number of exciting possibilities.

03:17:24.660 --> 03:17:29.300
So whenever you automate these kinds of things,

03:17:29.300 --> 03:17:31.420
just the world opens up.

03:17:31.420 --> 03:17:34.620
It's like programming itself and the computer,

03:17:34.620 --> 03:17:39.540
regular computer, has created innumerable applications.

03:17:39.540 --> 03:17:43.580
It made the world better in so many dimensions

03:17:43.580 --> 03:17:45.940
and it created of course a lot of negative things

03:17:45.940 --> 03:17:48.940
that we for some reason like to focus on

03:17:48.940 --> 03:17:52.340
using that very technology to tweet about it.

03:17:52.340 --> 03:17:55.460
But I think it made a much better world,

03:17:55.460 --> 03:17:57.580
but it created a lot of new dangers.

03:17:57.580 --> 03:18:02.580
So maybe you can speak to when you have,

03:18:02.580 --> 03:18:07.580
when you kind of stand at the end of the road

03:18:07.740 --> 03:18:12.740
for building a really solid, reliable, universal computer.

03:18:14.460 --> 03:18:16.380
What are the possibilities that are positive?

03:18:16.380 --> 03:18:18.100
What are the possibilities that are negative?

03:18:18.100 --> 03:18:21.060
How can we minimize the chance of the negative?

03:18:21.060 --> 03:18:22.460
Yeah, that's a really good question.

03:18:22.460 --> 03:18:25.300
So there's so many positive things from drug discovery,

03:18:25.300 --> 03:18:28.740
from supply chain stress,

03:18:28.740 --> 03:18:30.660
for basically enabling chemists

03:18:30.660 --> 03:18:32.580
to basically build more productive in the lab, right?

03:18:32.580 --> 03:18:35.300
Where the computer is not gonna replace the chemist.

03:18:35.300 --> 03:18:37.380
There's gonna be a Moore's law of molecules, right?

03:18:37.380 --> 03:18:39.740
There's gonna be so many more molecules we can design,

03:18:39.740 --> 03:18:41.540
so many more diseases we can cure.

03:18:41.540 --> 03:18:43.420
So chemists in the lab as researchers,

03:18:43.420 --> 03:18:44.740
that's better for science.

03:18:44.740 --> 03:18:48.340
So they can build a bunch of like,

03:18:48.340 --> 03:18:50.380
they could do science at a much more accelerated pace.

03:18:50.380 --> 03:18:51.980
So it's not just the development of drugs.

03:18:51.980 --> 03:18:54.300
It's actually like doing the basic understanding

03:18:54.300 --> 03:18:55.140
of the science of drugs.

03:18:55.140 --> 03:18:57.780
And the personalization, the cost of drugs right now,

03:18:57.780 --> 03:18:58.860
we're all living longer.

03:18:58.860 --> 03:19:00.380
We're all having more and more,

03:19:00.380 --> 03:19:02.340
we know more about our genomic development.

03:19:02.340 --> 03:19:05.020
We know about our predetermination

03:19:05.020 --> 03:19:06.460
and we might be able to,

03:19:06.460 --> 03:19:08.660
one dream I've got is like, imagine,

03:19:09.660 --> 03:19:11.900
you can work at your genome assistant,

03:19:11.900 --> 03:19:14.580
tells you you're gonna get cancer in seven years time,

03:19:14.580 --> 03:19:16.820
and you have your personal computer

03:19:16.820 --> 03:19:20.060
that cooks up the right molecule just for you to cure it,

03:19:20.060 --> 03:19:20.900
right?

03:19:20.900 --> 03:19:22.460
That's a really positive idea.

03:19:22.460 --> 03:19:25.260
The other thing is when drugs,

03:19:25.260 --> 03:19:28.660
so right now I think it is absolutely outrageous

03:19:28.660 --> 03:19:33.140
that not all of humanity has access to medicine.

03:19:33.140 --> 03:19:34.780
And I think the computer

03:19:34.780 --> 03:19:36.020
might be able to change that fundamentally

03:19:36.020 --> 03:19:38.940
because it will disrupt the way things are manufactured.

03:19:38.940 --> 03:19:40.860
So let's stop thinking about manufacturing

03:19:40.860 --> 03:19:41.900
in different factories.

03:19:41.900 --> 03:19:44.420
Let's say that computers,

03:19:44.420 --> 03:19:47.020
clinical grade computers or drug grade computers

03:19:47.020 --> 03:19:49.740
will be in facilities all around the world

03:19:49.740 --> 03:19:52.700
and they can make things on demand.

03:19:52.700 --> 03:19:54.420
As a function of the cost,

03:19:54.420 --> 03:19:56.060
maybe people won't be able to afford the latest

03:19:56.060 --> 03:19:57.220
and greatest patent,

03:19:57.220 --> 03:20:00.180
but maybe they'll be able to get the next best thing

03:20:00.180 --> 03:20:02.780
and we'll basically democratize,

03:20:02.780 --> 03:20:06.620
make available drugs to everybody that they need.

03:20:06.620 --> 03:20:10.540
And there's lots of really interesting things there.

03:20:10.540 --> 03:20:12.540
So I think that's gonna happen.

03:20:12.540 --> 03:20:16.980
I think that now let's take the negative.

03:20:16.980 --> 03:20:18.260
Before we do that,

03:20:18.260 --> 03:20:19.460
let's imagine what happened,

03:20:19.460 --> 03:20:21.900
go back to a really tragic accident a few years ago,

03:20:21.900 --> 03:20:23.020
well not accident,

03:20:23.020 --> 03:20:26.060
an act of murder by that pilot on the,

03:20:26.060 --> 03:20:28.380
I think it was Eurowings or Swisswings,

03:20:28.380 --> 03:20:30.700
but what he did is plane took off.

03:20:31.500 --> 03:20:33.540
He waited till his pilot went to the toilet.

03:20:33.540 --> 03:20:34.380
He was a co-pilot.

03:20:34.380 --> 03:20:37.820
He locked the door and then set the autopilot

03:20:39.220 --> 03:20:40.060
above the Alps.

03:20:40.060 --> 03:20:44.260
He set the altimeter or the descend height to zero.

03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:48.140
So the computer just took the plane into the Alps.

03:20:48.140 --> 03:20:51.700
Now, I mean, that was such a tragedy.

03:20:51.700 --> 03:20:53.220
Obviously the guy was mentally ill,

03:20:53.220 --> 03:20:55.140
but it wasn't just a tragedy for him.

03:20:55.140 --> 03:20:57.100
It was for all the people on board.

03:20:57.100 --> 03:20:59.500
But what if, and I was inspired by this and my thinking,

03:20:59.500 --> 03:21:04.060
what can I do to anticipate problems like this

03:21:04.060 --> 03:21:05.260
in the computer?

03:21:05.260 --> 03:21:08.380
Had the software, and I'm sure Boeing and Airbus

03:21:08.380 --> 03:21:11.260
will be thinking, oh, maybe I can give the computer

03:21:11.260 --> 03:21:12.660
a bit more situational awareness.

03:21:12.660 --> 03:21:15.660
So whenever someone tries to drop the height of the plane

03:21:15.660 --> 03:21:16.820
and it knows it's above the Alps,

03:21:16.820 --> 03:21:18.260
we'll just say, oh no, computer says,

03:21:18.260 --> 03:21:20.540
no, we're not letting you do that.

03:21:20.540 --> 03:21:22.220
Of course he would have been out to find another way.

03:21:22.220 --> 03:21:24.260
Maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel or something,

03:21:24.260 --> 03:21:25.340
but you know.

03:21:25.340 --> 03:21:28.820
Keep anticipating all the large number of trajectories

03:21:28.820 --> 03:21:29.660
that can go negative.

03:21:29.660 --> 03:21:31.460
All those kinds of running into the Alps

03:21:31.460 --> 03:21:36.460
and try to at least make it easy for the engineers

03:21:36.780 --> 03:21:38.540
to build systems that are protecting us that.

03:21:38.540 --> 03:21:40.500
Yeah, and let's just think,

03:21:40.500 --> 03:21:43.020
what in the computer world right now with KyDLs,

03:21:43.020 --> 03:21:45.060
let's just not think about what I'm doing right now.

03:21:45.060 --> 03:21:47.140
What I'm doing right now is completely open, right?

03:21:47.140 --> 03:21:49.020
Everyone's gonna know KyDLs and be playing with them,

03:21:49.020 --> 03:21:51.380
making them more easier and easier and easier.

03:21:51.380 --> 03:21:53.060
But what we're gonna start to do,

03:21:53.060 --> 03:21:58.060
it makes sense to encrypt the KyDLs in such a way

03:21:59.020 --> 03:22:01.140
let's say you work for a pharmaceutical company

03:22:01.140 --> 03:22:03.540
and you have a license to make a given molecule.

03:22:03.540 --> 03:22:05.180
Well, you get issued with a license

03:22:05.180 --> 03:22:07.420
by the FDA or your local authority.

03:22:07.420 --> 03:22:08.940
And they'll say, right, your license to do it,

03:22:08.940 --> 03:22:12.340
here it is, it's encrypted and the KyDL gets run.

03:22:12.340 --> 03:22:14.540
So you have a license for that instance of use.

03:22:14.540 --> 03:22:15.420
Easy to do.

03:22:15.420 --> 03:22:17.580
Computer science has already solved the problem.

03:22:17.580 --> 03:22:21.220
So the fact that we all trust online banking, right?

03:22:21.220 --> 03:22:23.060
The right now, then we can secure it.

03:22:23.060 --> 03:22:26.020
I'm 100% sure we can secure the computer.

03:22:26.980 --> 03:22:28.660
Because of the way we have a many,

03:22:28.660 --> 03:22:31.980
it's like the same mapping problem

03:22:31.980 --> 03:22:34.460
that you to actually reverse engineer a KyDL

03:22:34.460 --> 03:22:37.420
will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key.

03:22:38.740 --> 03:22:40.340
Brute force, it will be cheaper

03:22:41.300 --> 03:22:44.420
to just actually buy the regulated medicine.

03:22:44.420 --> 03:22:46.900
And actually people aren't gonna want to then

03:22:46.900 --> 03:22:49.380
make their own fake pharmaceuticals

03:22:49.380 --> 03:22:51.420
because it'll be so cheap to do it.

03:22:51.420 --> 03:22:53.700
We'll drop the cost of access to drugs.

03:22:53.700 --> 03:22:54.780
Now what will happen?

03:22:54.780 --> 03:22:56.180
Recreational drugs.

03:22:56.180 --> 03:22:57.020
People will start saying,

03:22:57.020 --> 03:22:59.700
well, I want access to recreational drugs.

03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:01.220
Well, it's gonna be up to,

03:23:01.220 --> 03:23:03.940
it's gonna accelerate that social discussion

03:23:03.940 --> 03:23:06.340
that's happening in the US and Canada and UK,

03:23:06.340 --> 03:23:07.180
everywhere, right?

03:23:07.180 --> 03:23:10.340
Because cost goes down, access goes up.

03:23:10.340 --> 03:23:13.780
Giving cannabis THC to some people who've got epilepsy

03:23:13.780 --> 03:23:16.540
isn't literally, forgive the term, a no-brainer

03:23:16.540 --> 03:23:19.660
because these poor people go from seizures like every day

03:23:19.660 --> 03:23:22.500
to maybe seizures just once every few months.

03:23:22.860 --> 03:23:25.460
That's an interesting idea to try to minimize the chance

03:23:25.460 --> 03:23:29.020
that it can get into the hands of individuals,

03:23:29.020 --> 03:23:32.940
like terrorists or people that want to do harm.

03:23:32.940 --> 03:23:35.700
Now with that kind of thing,

03:23:35.700 --> 03:23:39.180
you're putting a lot of power in the hands of governments,

03:23:39.180 --> 03:23:40.500
in the hands of institutions.

03:23:40.500 --> 03:23:44.140
And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism

03:23:44.140 --> 03:23:45.300
you might have of governments

03:23:45.300 --> 03:23:48.380
that can sometimes use these for ill,

03:23:48.380 --> 03:23:50.220
use them as weapons of war,

03:23:50.220 --> 03:23:54.740
not weapon, not tools of betterment.

03:23:54.740 --> 03:23:59.580
So, and sometimes not just war against other nations,

03:23:59.580 --> 03:24:01.540
but war against its own people

03:24:01.540 --> 03:24:03.460
has been done throughout history.

03:24:04.540 --> 03:24:06.220
Well, I'm thinking, so there's another way of doing it,

03:24:06.220 --> 03:24:09.260
a decentralized peer-to-peer version

03:24:09.260 --> 03:24:11.220
where, and what you have to do,

03:24:11.220 --> 03:24:13.060
I'm not saying you should adopt a blockchain,

03:24:13.060 --> 03:24:14.940
but there is a way of maybe taking KyDLs

03:24:14.940 --> 03:24:16.220
and put them in blockchain.

03:24:16.220 --> 03:24:17.780
Here's an idea, let's just say,

03:24:17.780 --> 03:24:18.820
the way we're doing it in my lab right now

03:24:18.860 --> 03:24:20.420
is we go to the literature,

03:24:20.420 --> 03:24:23.140
we take a recipe to make a molecule,

03:24:23.140 --> 03:24:24.940
convert that to KyDL,

03:24:24.940 --> 03:24:28.180
and diligently make it in the robot and validate it.

03:24:28.180 --> 03:24:30.820
We, that, so we, that I would call mining,

03:24:30.820 --> 03:24:33.580
proof of work, proof of synthesis, right?

03:24:33.580 --> 03:24:35.060
Proof of the synthesis.

03:24:35.060 --> 03:24:35.940
Yeah, yeah, but this is cool,

03:24:35.940 --> 03:24:38.940
because certainly when you actually synthesize it,

03:24:38.940 --> 03:24:40.180
you can get the analytical data,

03:24:40.180 --> 03:24:41.540
but there's also a fingerprint in there

03:24:41.540 --> 03:24:43.660
of the impurities that get carried across,

03:24:43.660 --> 03:24:46.420
because you can never make one something 100% pure.

03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:47.780
That fingerprint will allow you

03:24:47.780 --> 03:24:49.700
to secure your KyDL.

03:24:49.700 --> 03:24:51.500
So what you do is encrypt those two things.

03:24:51.500 --> 03:24:54.140
So suddenly you can have people out there mining,

03:24:54.140 --> 03:24:56.260
and what you could do, perhaps,

03:24:56.260 --> 03:24:58.060
is do the type of thing,

03:24:58.060 --> 03:25:00.220
we need to basically look at the way

03:25:00.220 --> 03:25:03.220
that contact tracing should have been done in COVID,

03:25:03.220 --> 03:25:05.500
where people are given the information.

03:25:05.500 --> 03:25:07.940
Say you've just been in contact with someone COVID,

03:25:07.940 --> 03:25:10.540
you choose, I'm not telling you to stay at home,

03:25:10.540 --> 03:25:12.260
you choose, right?

03:25:12.260 --> 03:25:14.260
So now, if we could imagine a similar thing,

03:25:14.260 --> 03:25:17.460
like, you know, you have got access to these chemicals,

03:25:17.460 --> 03:25:18.500
they will have these effects,

03:25:18.500 --> 03:25:20.940
you choose and publicize it,

03:25:20.940 --> 03:25:22.660
or maybe it's out somewhere, I don't know,

03:25:22.660 --> 03:25:25.260
I'm not a policymaker on this.

03:25:25.260 --> 03:25:27.540
And what my job here is to

03:25:27.540 --> 03:25:29.220
not just make the technology possible,

03:25:29.220 --> 03:25:31.940
but to have as open as a discussion as possible

03:25:31.940 --> 03:25:33.340
with people to say, hey,

03:25:33.340 --> 03:25:36.900
can we stop childhood mortality with this technology?

03:25:36.900 --> 03:25:40.300
And to those benefits outweigh the one-off

03:25:40.300 --> 03:25:42.420
where people might use it for terrorism,

03:25:42.420 --> 03:25:45.340
or people might use it for recreational drugs.

03:25:45.380 --> 03:25:47.380
Chemify, which is the name of the entity

03:25:47.380 --> 03:25:48.580
that will make this happen,

03:25:48.580 --> 03:25:51.020
I think we have some social responsibilities

03:25:51.020 --> 03:25:53.380
as an entity to make sure that we're not enabling people

03:25:53.380 --> 03:25:56.780
to manufacture personal drugs, weapons at will.

03:25:56.780 --> 03:25:59.660
And what we have to do is have a discussion with society,

03:25:59.660 --> 03:26:01.260
with the people who invest in this,

03:26:01.260 --> 03:26:03.660
with people that are gonna pay for this,

03:26:03.660 --> 03:26:05.860
to say, well, do you wanna live longer?

03:26:05.860 --> 03:26:07.540
And do you wanna be healthier?

03:26:07.540 --> 03:26:09.660
And are you willing to accept some of the risks?

03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:11.820
And I think that's a discussion to have.

03:26:11.820 --> 03:26:14.620
So by the way, when you say personal drugs,

03:26:14.620 --> 03:26:16.260
do you mean the illegal ones,

03:26:16.260 --> 03:26:19.860
or do you have a concern of just putting the manufacturer

03:26:19.860 --> 03:26:24.860
of any kind of legal drugs in the hands of regular people,

03:26:25.980 --> 03:26:28.140
because they might, like dose matters,

03:26:28.140 --> 03:26:29.940
they might take away too much?

03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:31.380
I mean, I would say, to be honest,

03:26:31.380 --> 03:26:34.100
that the chances of computers being,

03:26:34.100 --> 03:26:35.780
well, should always never,

03:26:35.780 --> 03:26:37.580
so the fact I can now say this means

03:26:37.580 --> 03:26:39.660
it's totally gonna come true, right?

03:26:39.660 --> 03:26:40.900
I'm going to do it.

03:26:40.900 --> 03:26:44.220
I cannot imagine that computers will be in people's houses

03:26:44.220 --> 03:26:48.940
anytime soon, but they might be at the local pharmacy, right?

03:26:48.940 --> 03:26:51.140
And if you've got a drug manufacturing facility

03:26:51.140 --> 03:26:53.580
in every town, then you just go

03:26:53.580 --> 03:26:54.700
and they give you a prescription.

03:26:54.700 --> 03:26:56.260
They do it in such a way, they format it

03:26:56.260 --> 03:26:59.380
so that you don't have to take 10 pills every day.

03:26:59.380 --> 03:27:01.940
You get one manufactured for you

03:27:01.940 --> 03:27:03.580
that has all the materials you need

03:27:03.580 --> 03:27:04.980
and the right distribution.

03:27:04.980 --> 03:27:05.820
Got it.

03:27:05.820 --> 03:27:07.300
But you mentioned recreation of drugs,

03:27:07.300 --> 03:27:09.220
and the reason I mentioned it,

03:27:09.220 --> 03:27:11.980
because I know people are gonna speak up on this.

03:27:11.980 --> 03:27:14.740
If the drug is legal, there's, to me,

03:27:14.740 --> 03:27:17.380
no reason why you can't manufacture,

03:27:17.380 --> 03:27:18.780
I mean, for recreation.

03:27:18.780 --> 03:27:19.620
I mean, you can do it right now.

03:27:19.620 --> 03:27:21.460
What do you have against fun, Lee?

03:27:24.580 --> 03:27:28.020
So, I mean, I'm a chemistry professor in a university

03:27:28.020 --> 03:27:29.420
who's an entrepreneur as well.

03:27:29.420 --> 03:27:31.780
I just think I need to be as responsible

03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:33.020
as I can in the discussion.

03:27:33.020 --> 03:27:34.220
Sure.

03:27:34.220 --> 03:27:35.140
No, sure, sure.

03:27:35.140 --> 03:27:37.780
But I know, so let me be the one that says,

03:27:37.780 --> 03:27:40.180
there's nothing, because you have said

03:27:40.220 --> 03:27:43.860
recreational drugs and terrorism in the same sentence.

03:27:43.860 --> 03:27:45.060
Yeah, yeah, okay.

03:27:45.060 --> 03:27:47.980
I think let's make sure we draw a line

03:27:47.980 --> 03:27:50.740
that there's real dangers to the world

03:27:50.740 --> 03:27:53.380
of terrorists, of bio warfare,

03:27:53.380 --> 03:27:56.140
and then there's a little bit of weed, so.

03:27:56.140 --> 03:27:59.980
So, I have, I mean, I think it's up to the society

03:27:59.980 --> 03:28:03.020
to tell its governments what it wants,

03:28:03.020 --> 03:28:04.700
what's acceptable, right?

03:28:04.700 --> 03:28:09.220
And if it becomes, let's say that THCs become

03:28:09.220 --> 03:28:12.860
heavily acceptable and that you can modify them.

03:28:12.860 --> 03:28:15.620
So, let's say there's, let's say it's like blood type.

03:28:15.620 --> 03:28:17.420
There's a particular type of THC

03:28:17.420 --> 03:28:20.340
that you tolerate better than I do.

03:28:20.340 --> 03:28:23.140
Then why not have a machine that makes the one you like?

03:28:23.140 --> 03:28:23.980
Yeah.

03:28:23.980 --> 03:28:24.820
And then, and why not?

03:28:24.820 --> 03:28:25.980
It's the perfect brownie.

03:28:26.980 --> 03:28:28.700
And I think that that's fine,

03:28:29.620 --> 03:28:32.340
but I'm, you know, we're so far away from that.

03:28:32.340 --> 03:28:34.500
I can barely get the thing to work in the lab, right?

03:28:34.500 --> 03:28:36.780
I mean, it's reliability and all this other stuff,

03:28:36.780 --> 03:28:39.100
but what I think is gonna happen in the short term,

03:28:39.980 --> 03:28:43.980
it's gonna turbocharge molecular discovery, reliability,

03:28:43.980 --> 03:28:45.500
and that will change the world.

03:28:45.500 --> 03:28:46.980
That's super exciting.

03:28:46.980 --> 03:28:49.340
You have a draft of a paper titled

03:28:49.340 --> 03:28:50.900
Autonomous Intelligent Exploration,

03:28:50.900 --> 03:28:53.780
Discovery and Optimization of Nanomaterials.

03:28:53.780 --> 03:28:55.820
So, we are talking about

03:28:55.820 --> 03:28:58.820
automating engineering of nanomaterials.

03:28:58.820 --> 03:29:01.100
How hard is this problem?

03:29:01.100 --> 03:29:04.860
And as we continue down this thread of the positives

03:29:04.860 --> 03:29:06.780
and the worrisome,

03:29:06.820 --> 03:29:09.700
what are the things we should be excited about

03:29:09.700 --> 03:29:12.340
and what are the things we should be terrified about

03:29:12.340 --> 03:29:13.980
and how do we minimize the chance

03:29:13.980 --> 03:29:18.100
of the terrifying consequences?

03:29:18.100 --> 03:29:21.420
So, in this robot, the robot does all the heavy lifting.

03:29:21.420 --> 03:29:24.500
So, the robot basically is an embodied AI.

03:29:24.500 --> 03:29:29.500
I really like AI in a domain-specific way.

03:29:29.900 --> 03:29:31.500
One that, as you should say at this point,

03:29:31.500 --> 03:29:34.300
there was an attempt in the 60s,

03:29:34.300 --> 03:29:37.340
Joshua Ledenberg and some really important people

03:29:37.340 --> 03:29:40.220
did this that made an AI to try and guess

03:29:40.220 --> 03:29:42.220
if organic molecules in the mass spectrum

03:29:42.220 --> 03:29:43.740
were alien or not.

03:29:43.740 --> 03:29:44.780
Yes.

03:29:44.780 --> 03:29:45.620
And they failed

03:29:45.620 --> 03:29:47.700
because they didn't have assembly theory.

03:29:47.700 --> 03:29:48.900
I see.

03:29:48.900 --> 03:29:49.740
And when I, and I-

03:29:49.740 --> 03:29:51.820
Wait, what does assembly theory give you

03:29:51.820 --> 03:29:53.580
about alien versus human life?

03:29:53.580 --> 03:29:55.700
Well, no, it just, it tells you about unknown,

03:29:55.700 --> 03:29:56.540
the degree of unknown.

03:29:56.540 --> 03:29:57.540
So, you can fingerprint stuff.

03:29:57.540 --> 03:29:58.900
They weren't looking at,

03:29:58.900 --> 03:30:01.300
they were trying to basically just look at the corpus

03:30:01.300 --> 03:30:04.100
of complex organic molecules.

03:30:04.540 --> 03:30:06.300
When I was a bit down about assembly theory,

03:30:06.300 --> 03:30:08.180
because I couldn't convince referees

03:30:08.180 --> 03:30:10.260
and couldn't convince computational,

03:30:11.660 --> 03:30:14.540
people interested in computational complexity,

03:30:14.540 --> 03:30:16.340
I was really quite depressed about it.

03:30:16.340 --> 03:30:20.140
And I mean, I've been working with Sarah Walker's team

03:30:20.140 --> 03:30:21.220
and I think she, you know,

03:30:21.220 --> 03:30:23.620
I think she also invented assembly theory in some way.

03:30:23.620 --> 03:30:25.180
We can talk about it later.

03:30:25.180 --> 03:30:30.180
When I found the AI not working for the Dendrel project,

03:30:30.980 --> 03:30:34.700
I suddenly realized I wasn't totally insane.

03:30:34.700 --> 03:30:37.220
Coming back to this nano robot.

03:30:37.220 --> 03:30:40.020
So what it does, it's basically like a computer,

03:30:40.020 --> 03:30:42.980
but now what it does is it squirts a liquid

03:30:42.980 --> 03:30:45.420
with gold in it, in the test tube,

03:30:45.420 --> 03:30:49.660
and it adds some reducing agents,

03:30:49.660 --> 03:30:51.620
so some electrons to make the gold

03:30:51.620 --> 03:30:53.260
turn into a nanoparticle.

03:30:53.260 --> 03:30:54.820
Now, when gold becomes a nanoparticle,

03:30:54.820 --> 03:30:56.820
it gets a characteristic color, a plasmon.

03:30:56.820 --> 03:30:58.740
So it's a bit like if you look at the sheen

03:30:58.740 --> 03:31:01.300
on a gold wedding ring or gold bar or something,

03:31:01.300 --> 03:31:03.660
those are the ways of conducting electrons

03:31:03.660 --> 03:31:05.860
basically reflect light.

03:31:05.860 --> 03:31:09.580
What we did is we randomly squirt the gold particle

03:31:09.580 --> 03:31:11.940
and the reducing agent in and we measure the UV,

03:31:11.940 --> 03:31:13.540
we measure the color.

03:31:13.540 --> 03:31:16.900
And so what we do is we've got, the robot has a mind,

03:31:16.900 --> 03:31:20.380
so it has a mind where in a simulation,

03:31:20.380 --> 03:31:23.860
it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon,

03:31:23.860 --> 03:31:27.340
the color that comes out, randomly imagines in its head.

03:31:28.300 --> 03:31:29.820
So that's the imaginary side of the robot.

03:31:29.820 --> 03:31:30.860
And the physical side of the robot,

03:31:30.860 --> 03:31:34.620
it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color

03:31:34.620 --> 03:31:36.420
and it uses a genetic algorithm

03:31:36.420 --> 03:31:38.660
and a map elite actually on it.

03:31:38.660 --> 03:31:41.820
And it goes around in cycles and refines

03:31:43.220 --> 03:31:45.380
the color to the objective.

03:31:45.380 --> 03:31:46.780
Now we use two different points.

03:31:46.780 --> 03:31:50.300
We have an exploration and an optimization.

03:31:50.300 --> 03:31:51.140
They're two different.

03:31:51.140 --> 03:31:54.420
So the exploration just says, just do random stuff

03:31:54.420 --> 03:31:55.940
and see how many different things you can get.

03:31:55.940 --> 03:31:57.500
And when you get different things,

03:31:57.500 --> 03:32:00.780
try and optimize and make the peak sharper, sharper, sharper.

03:32:00.780 --> 03:32:03.180
And what it does after a number of cycles

03:32:03.180 --> 03:32:05.420
is it physically takes a sample

03:32:05.420 --> 03:32:07.860
of the optimized nanomaterial,

03:32:07.860 --> 03:32:10.140
resets all of the round bottom flasks,

03:32:10.140 --> 03:32:14.660
cleans them and puts the seed, physical seed back in.

03:32:14.660 --> 03:32:15.900
And then what this robot is able to do

03:32:15.900 --> 03:32:20.620
is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions

03:32:20.620 --> 03:32:23.060
in just a thousand experiments in three days.

03:32:24.020 --> 03:32:26.540
And it makes five generations of nanoparticles

03:32:26.540 --> 03:32:28.580
which get nicer and nicer in terms of shape

03:32:28.580 --> 03:32:30.140
and color and definition.

03:32:30.140 --> 03:32:33.100
And then at the end it outputs a Kyde-L code.

03:32:33.100 --> 03:32:34.020
That could then be-

03:32:34.020 --> 03:32:38.220
Wow, it's doing the search for programs

03:32:38.220 --> 03:32:39.700
in the physical space.

03:32:39.700 --> 03:32:42.620
So it's doing a kind of reinforcement learning.

03:32:42.620 --> 03:32:44.180
Yeah, yeah, in the physical space.

03:32:44.180 --> 03:32:46.580
With the exploration and the optimization.

03:32:46.580 --> 03:32:48.740
And that Kyde-L will work on any computer

03:32:48.740 --> 03:32:49.700
or any qualified hardware.

03:32:49.700 --> 03:32:53.220
Now that's it, now that's a general piece of code

03:32:53.220 --> 03:32:57.900
that can replicate somewhat, maybe perfectly,

03:32:57.900 --> 03:32:58.940
what it created.

03:32:58.940 --> 03:33:00.340
That's amazing, that's incredible.

03:33:00.340 --> 03:33:02.180
But the nanoparticles themselves are dumb.

03:33:02.180 --> 03:33:03.540
The robot has all the thinking.

03:33:03.540 --> 03:33:06.620
So we don't try and imply any self-replication

03:33:06.620 --> 03:33:09.700
or try and get the particles to make themselves.

03:33:09.700 --> 03:33:11.500
Although it would be cool to try.

03:33:11.500 --> 03:33:13.060
So, well, there you go.

03:33:13.060 --> 03:33:14.940
Those are famous last words

03:33:14.940 --> 03:33:16.780
for the end of human civilization.

03:33:16.780 --> 03:33:17.860
Would be cool to try.

03:33:17.860 --> 03:33:21.420
So is it possible to create molecules

03:33:21.420 --> 03:33:24.820
that start approaching this question

03:33:24.820 --> 03:33:26.580
that we started this conversation,

03:33:26.580 --> 03:33:29.540
which is the origin of life.

03:33:29.540 --> 03:33:33.980
To start to create molecules that have lifelike qualities.

03:33:33.980 --> 03:33:36.220
So have the replication,

03:33:36.220 --> 03:33:40.140
have like complex, start to create complex organisms.

03:33:40.140 --> 03:33:42.020
So we have done this with the oxides.

03:33:42.020 --> 03:33:43.900
I talked about earlier with the molybdenum oxides

03:33:43.900 --> 03:33:45.740
and the rings and the bulls.

03:33:45.740 --> 03:33:48.340
And the problem is that they do,

03:33:49.300 --> 03:33:52.020
they autocadalytically enhance one another.

03:33:52.020 --> 03:33:55.780
So they would, I guess you would call it self-replication.

03:33:55.780 --> 03:34:00.780
But because there's limited function and mutation,

03:34:01.900 --> 03:34:02.740
they're pretty dumb.

03:34:02.740 --> 03:34:04.540
So they don't do very much.

03:34:04.540 --> 03:34:09.540
So I think the prospect of us being able to engineer

03:34:10.340 --> 03:34:13.700
a nanomaterial life form in the short term,

03:34:13.700 --> 03:34:14.780
like I said earlier,

03:34:14.820 --> 03:34:16.460
my aim is to do this, of course.

03:34:16.460 --> 03:34:18.500
I mean, on one hand, I'm saying it's impossible.

03:34:18.500 --> 03:34:19.580
On the other hand, I'm saying I'm doing it.

03:34:19.580 --> 03:34:20.420
So which is it, Lee?

03:34:20.420 --> 03:34:23.740
It's like, well, I think we can do it,

03:34:23.740 --> 03:34:25.020
but only in the robot.

03:34:25.020 --> 03:34:26.460
So the causal chain that's gonna allow it

03:34:26.460 --> 03:34:27.540
is in the robot.

03:34:27.540 --> 03:34:30.060
These particles, if they do start to self-replicate,

03:34:30.060 --> 03:34:32.340
the system's gonna be so fragile

03:34:32.340 --> 03:34:35.980
that I don't think anything dangerous will come out.

03:34:35.980 --> 03:34:38.300
And it doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them

03:34:38.300 --> 03:34:42.300
as potentially, I mean, I don't want to scare people

03:34:42.300 --> 03:34:43.260
like gain of function,

03:34:43.260 --> 03:34:45.180
we're gonna produce stuff that comes out.

03:34:45.180 --> 03:34:48.100
Our number one kill switch is that we always try

03:34:48.100 --> 03:34:52.500
to search a space of objects

03:34:52.500 --> 03:34:55.860
that don't exist in the environment.

03:34:55.860 --> 03:34:58.580
So even if something got out, it just would die immediately.

03:34:58.580 --> 03:35:02.140
It's like making a silicon life form or something or, you know.

03:35:02.140 --> 03:35:04.380
Which is the opposite of oftentimes

03:35:04.380 --> 03:35:06.420
gain of function research just focused on, like,

03:35:06.420 --> 03:35:09.380
how do you get a dangerous thing

03:35:09.380 --> 03:35:11.740
to be closer to something that works with humans?

03:35:12.140 --> 03:35:13.460
So have it jump to humans.

03:35:13.460 --> 03:35:16.860
So that's the one good mode to operate on

03:35:16.860 --> 03:35:21.860
is always try to operate on chemical entities

03:35:22.140 --> 03:35:25.260
that are very different than the kind of chemical environment

03:35:25.260 --> 03:35:26.340
that humans operate in.

03:35:26.340 --> 03:35:29.620
Yeah, and also, I mean, I'll say something dramatic,

03:35:29.620 --> 03:35:34.620
which may not be true, so I should be careful.

03:35:35.180 --> 03:35:39.140
If, let's say, we did discover a new living system

03:35:39.140 --> 03:35:41.900
and it was made out of a shadow biosphere

03:35:42.900 --> 03:35:45.380
and we just released it in the environment, who cares?

03:35:45.380 --> 03:35:46.940
It's gonna use different stuff.

03:35:48.260 --> 03:35:49.580
It'll just live.

03:35:50.420 --> 03:35:51.260
Just live, yeah.

03:35:52.540 --> 03:35:55.780
One of my biggest fantasies is actually is like a planet

03:35:55.780 --> 03:35:58.380
that's basically half in the sun, it doesn't rotate, right?

03:35:58.380 --> 03:36:02.220
And you have two different origins of life on that planet

03:36:03.300 --> 03:36:05.140
and they don't share the same chemistry.

03:36:05.140 --> 03:36:05.980
Yeah.

03:36:05.980 --> 03:36:08.100
And then the only way time they recognize each other

03:36:08.100 --> 03:36:09.660
is when they become intelligent, they go,

03:36:09.660 --> 03:36:10.660
well, what's that moving?

03:36:10.660 --> 03:36:11.500
Yeah.

03:36:12.940 --> 03:36:14.780
They co-evolve, that's fascinating.

03:36:14.780 --> 03:36:17.500
I mean, so one fascinating thing to do

03:36:17.500 --> 03:36:20.820
is exactly what you were saying, which is a life bomb,

03:36:20.820 --> 03:36:25.820
which is like try to focus on atmospheres

03:36:25.940 --> 03:36:29.740
or chemical conditions of other planets

03:36:29.740 --> 03:36:34.740
and try within this kind of exploration optimization system

03:36:35.740 --> 03:36:40.740
try to discover life forms that can work

03:36:40.740 --> 03:36:43.660
in those conditions and then you send those life forms

03:36:43.660 --> 03:36:46.100
over there and see what kind of stuff they build up.

03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:48.540
Like you can do like a large scale,

03:36:48.540 --> 03:36:51.660
it's kind of a safe physical environment

03:36:51.660 --> 03:36:54.500
to do large scale experiments, it's another planet.

03:36:54.500 --> 03:36:57.020
Yeah, so look, I'm gonna say something quite contentious.

03:36:57.020 --> 03:36:58.780
I mean, Elon wants to go to Mars,

03:36:58.780 --> 03:37:00.260
I think it's brilliant, wants to go to Mars,

03:37:00.260 --> 03:37:02.340
but I would counter that and say,

03:37:02.580 --> 03:37:06.100
is Elon just obsessed with getting humanity off Earth

03:37:06.100 --> 03:37:08.140
or what about just technology?

03:37:08.140 --> 03:37:10.740
So if we do technology, so Elon either needs

03:37:10.740 --> 03:37:11.860
to take a computer to Mars

03:37:11.860 --> 03:37:14.220
because he needs to manufacture drugs on demand, right?

03:37:14.220 --> 03:37:15.860
Because you zero cost payload

03:37:15.860 --> 03:37:17.500
and all that stuff is just code.

03:37:17.500 --> 03:37:20.100
Or what we do is we actually say, hang on,

03:37:20.100 --> 03:37:22.620
it's quite hard for humans to survive on Mars.

03:37:22.620 --> 03:37:25.500
Why don't we write a series of origin of life algorithms

03:37:25.500 --> 03:37:27.620
where we embed our culture in it, right?

03:37:27.620 --> 03:37:30.260
It's a very Ridley spot Prometheus, right?

03:37:30.260 --> 03:37:31.820
Which is a terrible film by the way.

03:37:31.940 --> 03:37:36.940
But anyway, and dump it on Mars and just terraform Mars.

03:37:37.300 --> 03:37:39.660
And what we do is we evolve life on Mars

03:37:39.660 --> 03:37:42.180
that is suited to life on Mars

03:37:42.180 --> 03:37:44.660
rather than brute forcing human life on Mars.

03:37:44.660 --> 03:37:48.580
So one of the questions is, what is human culture?

03:37:48.580 --> 03:37:50.180
What are the things you encode?

03:37:50.180 --> 03:37:52.660
Some of it is knowledge, some of it is information.

03:37:52.660 --> 03:37:55.340
But the thing that Elon talks about,

03:37:56.340 --> 03:37:58.700
the thing I think about, I think you think about as well

03:37:58.700 --> 03:38:03.700
is some of the more unique aspects of what makes us human,

03:38:06.420 --> 03:38:09.780
which is our particular kind of consciousness.

03:38:09.780 --> 03:38:13.220
So he talks about the flame of human consciousness.

03:38:13.220 --> 03:38:15.140
That's one of the questions is,

03:38:15.140 --> 03:38:20.140
can we instill consciousness into other beings?

03:38:22.140 --> 03:38:24.340
Because that's a sad thought

03:38:24.340 --> 03:38:27.860
that whatever this thing inside our minds

03:38:27.860 --> 03:38:32.860
that hopes and dreams and fears and loves can all die.

03:38:33.940 --> 03:38:37.540
Yeah, but I think you already know the answer to that question.

03:38:37.540 --> 03:38:40.180
I have a robot lawn mower at home.

03:38:40.180 --> 03:38:42.380
My kids call it CC, cool cutter.

03:38:42.380 --> 03:38:44.740
It's a robot mow.

03:38:44.740 --> 03:38:46.020
And the way it works,

03:38:46.020 --> 03:38:48.020
it has an electric field around the perimeter

03:38:48.020 --> 03:38:49.940
and it just tell it the area.

03:38:49.940 --> 03:38:52.860
And it goes out and goes from its base station,

03:38:52.860 --> 03:38:55.220
just mows a bit, gets to the perimeter,

03:38:55.220 --> 03:38:57.620
detects the perimeter and then chooses a random angle,

03:38:57.620 --> 03:38:58.900
rotates around and goes on.

03:38:58.900 --> 03:38:59.740
Yeah.

03:38:59.740 --> 03:39:02.020
But my kids call it cool cutter.

03:39:02.020 --> 03:39:02.860
It's a she.

03:39:02.860 --> 03:39:03.780
I don't know why it's a she.

03:39:03.780 --> 03:39:05.420
They just, they, when they were like quite young,

03:39:05.420 --> 03:39:08.420
they called it, I don't want to be sexist there.

03:39:08.420 --> 03:39:10.020
It could be a he, but they liked.

03:39:11.860 --> 03:39:13.140
They gendered the lawn mower.

03:39:13.140 --> 03:39:14.140
They gendered the lawn mower.

03:39:14.140 --> 03:39:14.980
Okay.

03:39:14.980 --> 03:39:15.820
Yeah, why not?

03:39:15.820 --> 03:39:17.820
But I was thinking this lawn mower,

03:39:17.820 --> 03:39:20.780
if you apply integrated information theory to lawn mower,

03:39:20.780 --> 03:39:22.660
lawn mower is conscious.

03:39:22.660 --> 03:39:25.020
Now, integrated information theory

03:39:25.980 --> 03:39:28.220
is that people say as a flawed way measuring consciousness,

03:39:28.220 --> 03:39:29.060
but I don't think it is.

03:39:29.060 --> 03:39:32.060
I think assembly theory actually measures consciousness

03:39:32.060 --> 03:39:33.220
in the same way.

03:39:33.220 --> 03:39:35.900
Consciousness is something that is generated

03:39:35.900 --> 03:39:38.820
over a population of objects of humans.

03:39:38.820 --> 03:39:40.980
Consciousness didn't suddenly spring in.

03:39:40.980 --> 03:39:43.180
Our consciousness has evolved together, right?

03:39:43.180 --> 03:39:45.980
The fact we're here and the robots we leave behind,

03:39:45.980 --> 03:39:47.140
they all have some of that.

03:39:47.140 --> 03:39:49.100
So we won't lose it all.

03:39:49.100 --> 03:39:50.900
Sure, consciousness requires

03:39:50.900 --> 03:39:52.820
that we have many models being generated.

03:39:52.820 --> 03:39:54.940
It's not just one domain specific AI, right?

03:39:55.780 --> 03:39:57.460
The way it created consciousness,

03:39:57.460 --> 03:39:58.700
I'm gonna say unashamedly,

03:39:58.700 --> 03:40:01.300
the best way to make a consciousness

03:40:01.300 --> 03:40:02.900
is in a chemical system

03:40:02.900 --> 03:40:05.340
because you just have access to many more states.

03:40:05.340 --> 03:40:06.300
And the problem right now

03:40:06.300 --> 03:40:08.620
with making silicon consciousness

03:40:08.620 --> 03:40:10.900
is you just don't have enough states.

03:40:10.900 --> 03:40:12.780
So there are more possible states,

03:40:12.780 --> 03:40:15.020
or sorry, there are more possible configurations possible

03:40:15.020 --> 03:40:17.980
in your brain than there are atoms in the universe.

03:40:17.980 --> 03:40:20.500
And you can switch between them.

03:40:20.500 --> 03:40:22.380
You can't do that on a core I-10.

03:40:22.740 --> 03:40:25.260
It's got 10 billion, 12 billion, 14 billion transistors,

03:40:25.260 --> 03:40:28.340
but you can't reconfigure them as dynamically.

03:40:28.340 --> 03:40:31.420
Well, you've shared this intuition a few times already

03:40:31.420 --> 03:40:34.620
that the larger number of states

03:40:34.620 --> 03:40:38.420
somehow correlates to greater possibility of life,

03:40:38.420 --> 03:40:42.380
but it's also possible the constraints are essential here.

03:40:42.380 --> 03:40:43.420
Yeah, yeah.

03:40:43.420 --> 03:40:45.620
I mean, but coming back to the,

03:40:45.620 --> 03:40:46.820
you worry that something's lost.

03:40:46.820 --> 03:40:47.660
I agree.

03:40:48.620 --> 03:40:53.620
But I think that, you know, we will get to an AGI,

03:40:53.740 --> 03:40:56.180
but I wonder if it's not,

03:40:56.180 --> 03:40:58.260
it can't be separate from human,

03:40:58.260 --> 03:41:00.060
it can't be separate from human consciousness

03:41:00.060 --> 03:41:03.020
because the causal chain that produced it came from humans.

03:41:03.020 --> 03:41:06.380
So what I kind of try and suggest heavily

03:41:06.380 --> 03:41:11.380
to people worry about the existential threat of AI saying,

03:41:11.500 --> 03:41:13.420
I mean, you put it much more elegantly earlier,

03:41:13.420 --> 03:41:15.820
like we should worry about algorithms,

03:41:15.820 --> 03:41:18.660
dumb algorithms written by human beings on Twitter,

03:41:18.660 --> 03:41:21.140
driving us insane, right?

03:41:21.140 --> 03:41:23.260
And doing acting in odd ways.

03:41:23.260 --> 03:41:24.940
Yeah, I think intelligence,

03:41:24.940 --> 03:41:27.100
this is what I have been in eloquent

03:41:27.100 --> 03:41:28.620
in trying to describe it,

03:41:30.180 --> 03:41:33.740
partially because I try not to think

03:41:33.740 --> 03:41:34.940
too deeply through this stuff

03:41:34.940 --> 03:41:36.260
because then you become a philosopher,

03:41:36.260 --> 03:41:40.460
I still aspire to actually building a bunch of stuff.

03:41:40.460 --> 03:41:45.120
But my sense is super intelligence leads to,

03:41:46.740 --> 03:41:48.780
deep integration into human society.

03:41:48.780 --> 03:41:51.980
So like intelligence is strongly correlated.

03:41:51.980 --> 03:41:56.980
Like intelligence, the way we conceive of intelligence

03:41:56.980 --> 03:42:01.980
materializes as a thing that becomes a fun entity

03:42:03.300 --> 03:42:06.420
to have at a party with humans.

03:42:06.420 --> 03:42:09.980
So like it's a mix of wit, intelligence, humor,

03:42:09.980 --> 03:42:11.740
like intelligence, like knowledge,

03:42:11.740 --> 03:42:14.340
ability to do reasoning and so on,

03:42:14.340 --> 03:42:17.980
but also humor, emotional intelligence,

03:42:17.980 --> 03:42:22.980
ability to love, to dream, to share those dreams,

03:42:23.460 --> 03:42:28.080
to play the game of human civilization,

03:42:28.080 --> 03:42:30.100
the push and pull, the whole dance of it,

03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:31.380
the whole dance of life.

03:42:31.380 --> 03:42:35.420
And I think that kind of super intelligent being

03:42:35.420 --> 03:42:38.140
is not the thing that worries me.

03:42:38.140 --> 03:42:41.100
I think that ultimately will enrich life.

03:42:41.100 --> 03:42:43.020
It's again, the dumb algorithms,

03:42:43.020 --> 03:42:46.540
the dumb algorithms that scale in the hands of people

03:42:46.540 --> 03:42:48.820
that are too, don't study history,

03:42:48.820 --> 03:42:51.740
that don't study human psychology and human nature,

03:42:51.740 --> 03:42:56.740
just applying too broadly for selfish near-term interests.

03:42:56.960 --> 03:42:58.440
That's the biggest danger.

03:42:58.440 --> 03:43:01.380
Yeah, I think it's not a new danger, right?

03:43:01.380 --> 03:43:04.620
I now know how I should use Twitter

03:43:04.620 --> 03:43:07.440
and how I shouldn't use Twitter, right?

03:43:07.440 --> 03:43:09.600
I like to provoke people into thinking.

03:43:09.600 --> 03:43:11.540
I don't want to provoke people into outrage.

03:43:11.540 --> 03:43:12.380
It's not fun.

03:43:12.380 --> 03:43:14.620
It's not a good thing for humans to do, right?

03:43:14.620 --> 03:43:16.700
And I think that when you get people into outrage,

03:43:16.700 --> 03:43:20.020
they take sides and taking sides is really bad.

03:43:20.020 --> 03:43:22.060
But I think that we're all beginning to see this.

03:43:22.060 --> 03:43:24.780
And I think that actually I'm very optimistic

03:43:24.780 --> 03:43:28.980
about how things will evolve because I wonder

03:43:28.980 --> 03:43:31.980
how much productivity has Twitter

03:43:31.980 --> 03:43:33.780
and social media has taken out of humanity

03:43:33.780 --> 03:43:36.580
because how many now, I mean,

03:43:36.580 --> 03:43:38.940
so the good thing about Twitter is it gives power.

03:43:38.940 --> 03:43:41.300
So it gives voice to minorities, right?

03:43:41.780 --> 03:43:44.220
And that's good to some degree.

03:43:44.220 --> 03:43:47.440
But I wonder how much voice does it give

03:43:47.440 --> 03:43:52.440
to all sorts of other problems

03:43:52.440 --> 03:43:54.300
that don't need this emerge?

03:43:54.300 --> 03:43:56.660
By the way, when you say minorities, I think,

03:43:57.820 --> 03:44:00.000
or at least if I were to agree with you,

03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:02.380
what I would say is minorities broadly defined,

03:44:02.380 --> 03:44:07.380
any small groups of people that,

03:44:07.860 --> 03:44:12.860
it magnifies the concerns of the small versus the big.

03:44:12.940 --> 03:44:14.640
That is good to some degree.

03:44:15.700 --> 03:44:18.020
But I think, I mean, I have to be careful

03:44:18.020 --> 03:44:20.980
because I think I have a very,

03:44:20.980 --> 03:44:23.460
I mean, I think that the world isn't that broken, right?

03:44:23.460 --> 03:44:25.140
I think the world is a pretty cool place.

03:44:25.140 --> 03:44:27.020
I think academia is really great.

03:44:27.020 --> 03:44:31.580
I think climate change presents a really interesting problem

03:44:31.580 --> 03:44:33.560
for humanity that we will solve.

03:44:33.560 --> 03:44:35.860
I like how you said it's a pretty cool problem

03:44:36.820 --> 03:44:37.660
for civilization.

03:44:37.660 --> 03:44:38.500
It's a big one.

03:44:38.500 --> 03:44:42.620
Well, there's a bunch of really, really big problems

03:44:42.620 --> 03:44:45.960
that if solved can significantly improve

03:44:45.960 --> 03:44:47.580
the quality of life.

03:44:47.580 --> 03:44:49.580
That ultimately is what we're trying to do,

03:44:49.580 --> 03:44:51.700
improve how awesome life is

03:44:51.700 --> 03:44:53.420
for the maximum number of people.

03:44:53.420 --> 03:44:56.620
Yeah, and I think the coming back to consciousness,

03:44:56.620 --> 03:45:00.340
I don't think the universe is doomed to heat death, right?

03:45:00.340 --> 03:45:01.460
It's one of the optimists.

03:45:01.460 --> 03:45:03.300
That's why I want to kind of nudge you

03:45:03.300 --> 03:45:04.760
into thinking that time is fundamental

03:45:04.760 --> 03:45:05.880
because if time is fundamental,

03:45:05.880 --> 03:45:09.240
then suddenly you don't have to give it back.

03:45:09.240 --> 03:45:11.240
The universe just constructs stuff.

03:45:11.240 --> 03:45:13.320
You know, and what we see around us in our construction,

03:45:13.320 --> 03:45:16.120
I know everyone's worried about how fragile civilization is.

03:45:16.120 --> 03:45:17.800
And I mean, look at the fundamentals.

03:45:17.800 --> 03:45:22.040
We're good until the sun expands, right?

03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:23.840
We've got quite a lot of resource on earth.

03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:25.720
We're trying to be quite cooperative.

03:45:25.720 --> 03:45:27.800
Humans are nice to each other

03:45:27.800 --> 03:45:31.920
when they're not under enormous stress.

03:45:31.920 --> 03:45:33.820
But coming back to the consciousness thing,

03:45:33.820 --> 03:45:36.660
are we going to send human beings to Mars

03:45:36.660 --> 03:45:38.460
or conscious robots to Mars?

03:45:38.460 --> 03:45:40.500
Or are we going to send some hybrid?

03:45:40.500 --> 03:45:43.380
And I don't know the answer to that question right now.

03:45:43.380 --> 03:45:45.260
I guess, you know, Elon is going to have

03:45:45.260 --> 03:45:46.540
a pretty good go at getting there.

03:45:46.540 --> 03:45:50.940
I'm not sure whether, I have my doubts,

03:45:50.940 --> 03:45:52.500
but I'm not qualified.

03:45:52.500 --> 03:45:54.340
You know, I'm sure people have their doubts

03:45:54.340 --> 03:45:58.340
that computation works, but I've got it working.

03:45:58.340 --> 03:45:59.380
And I, you know.

03:45:59.380 --> 03:46:02.900
And most of the cool technologies we have today,

03:46:03.700 --> 03:46:06.900
and take for granted, like the airplane,

03:46:06.900 --> 03:46:10.820
a aforementioned airplane, were things that people doubted.

03:46:10.820 --> 03:46:13.100
Every, like majority of people doubted

03:46:13.100 --> 03:46:16.140
before they came to life and they come to life.

03:46:16.140 --> 03:46:19.180
And speaking of hybrid AI and humans,

03:46:19.180 --> 03:46:21.540
it's fascinating to think about all the different ways

03:46:21.540 --> 03:46:25.100
that hybridization, that merger can happen.

03:46:25.100 --> 03:46:27.340
I mean, we currently have the smartphone,

03:46:27.340 --> 03:46:28.540
so there's already a hybrid,

03:46:28.540 --> 03:46:31.460
but there's all kinds of ways that hybrid happens,

03:46:31.460 --> 03:46:34.420
how we and other technology play together,

03:46:34.420 --> 03:46:37.500
like a computer, how that changes

03:46:37.500 --> 03:46:40.780
the fabric of human civilization is like wide open.

03:46:40.780 --> 03:46:42.580
Who knows, who knows?

03:46:42.580 --> 03:46:43.820
If you remove,

03:46:46.100 --> 03:46:47.780
if you remove cancer,

03:46:47.780 --> 03:46:52.500
if you remove major diseases from humanity,

03:46:54.020 --> 03:46:55.660
there's going to be a bunch of consequences

03:46:55.660 --> 03:46:57.180
we're not anticipating.

03:46:57.180 --> 03:47:01.140
Many of them positive, but many of them negative.

03:47:01.140 --> 03:47:04.180
Many of them, most of them, at least I hope,

03:47:04.180 --> 03:47:06.660
are weird and wonderful and fun

03:47:06.660 --> 03:47:08.740
in ways that are totally unexpected.

03:47:08.740 --> 03:47:11.860
And we sitting on a porch with a bottle of Jack Daniels

03:47:11.860 --> 03:47:14.540
and a rocker will say, kids these days

03:47:14.540 --> 03:47:17.260
don't appreciate how hard we had it back in the day.

03:47:17.260 --> 03:47:21.380
I gotta ask you, speaking of nudging,

03:47:21.380 --> 03:47:25.220
you and Josje Bach nudge each other on Twitter

03:47:25.220 --> 03:47:29.460
quite a bit in wonderful intellectual debates.

03:47:29.460 --> 03:47:30.860
And of course, for people who don't know,

03:47:31.540 --> 03:47:32.380
Josje Bach is this brilliant guy.

03:47:32.380 --> 03:47:34.380
He's been on the podcast a couple times.

03:47:35.340 --> 03:47:38.820
You tweeted, or he tweeted,

03:47:38.820 --> 03:47:41.140
Josje Bach, everyone should follow him as well.

03:47:41.140 --> 03:47:43.380
You should definitely follow Mr. Lee Cronin,

03:47:43.380 --> 03:47:44.460
Dr. Lee Cronin.

03:47:45.900 --> 03:47:48.180
He tweeted, dinner with Lee Cronin.

03:47:48.180 --> 03:47:50.900
We discussed that while we can translate

03:47:50.900 --> 03:47:54.420
every working model of existence into a Turing machine,

03:47:54.420 --> 03:47:56.820
the structure of the universe might be given

03:47:56.820 --> 03:47:59.700
by wakes of non-existence in a pattern generated

03:47:59.700 --> 03:48:04.220
by all possible automata which exist by default.

03:48:05.820 --> 03:48:09.940
And then he followed on saying face to face is the best.

03:48:09.940 --> 03:48:12.180
So the dinner was face to face.

03:48:12.180 --> 03:48:16.460
What is Josje talking about in wakes, quote,

03:48:16.460 --> 03:48:19.820
wakes of non-existence in a pattern generated

03:48:19.820 --> 03:48:24.820
by all possible automata which exist by default?

03:48:25.460 --> 03:48:29.860
So automata exists by default, apparently.

03:48:29.860 --> 03:48:31.740
And then there's wakes of non-existence.

03:48:31.740 --> 03:48:34.900
What the hell is non-existence in the universe?

03:48:34.900 --> 03:48:39.340
That's, and also in another conversation,

03:48:40.900 --> 03:48:44.420
you tweeted, it's state machines all the way down,

03:48:44.420 --> 03:48:46.220
which presumably is the origin story

03:48:46.220 --> 03:48:47.780
of this dinner discussion.

03:48:47.780 --> 03:48:52.780
And then Josje said, again, nudging, nudging.

03:48:53.220 --> 03:48:54.660
Nudging slash trolling.

03:48:55.540 --> 03:48:57.900
Josje said, you've seen the light.

03:48:57.900 --> 03:48:59.260
Welcome, friend.

03:48:59.260 --> 03:49:01.660
Many foundational physicists effectively believe

03:49:01.660 --> 03:49:04.420
in some form of hypercomputation.

03:49:04.420 --> 03:49:07.060
Lee is coming around to this idea.

03:49:07.060 --> 03:49:10.180
And then you said, I think there are notable differences.

03:49:10.180 --> 03:49:13.100
First, I think the universe does not have to be a computer.

03:49:13.100 --> 03:49:16.820
Second, I want to understand how the universe emerges

03:49:16.820 --> 03:49:18.460
constructors that build computers.

03:49:18.460 --> 03:49:23.460
And third is that there is something below church touring.

03:49:24.980 --> 03:49:29.980
Okay, what the heck is this dinner conversation about?

03:49:30.780 --> 03:49:34.700
Maybe put another way, maybe zooming out a little bit.

03:49:34.700 --> 03:49:37.020
Are there interesting agreements or disagreements

03:49:37.020 --> 03:49:41.540
between you and Josje Bach that can elucidate

03:49:41.540 --> 03:49:44.060
some of the other topics we've been talking about?

03:49:44.060 --> 03:49:46.100
Yeah, so Josje has an incredible mind

03:49:46.100 --> 03:49:51.100
and he's so well-read and uses language really elegantly.

03:49:53.300 --> 03:49:54.820
It bamboozles me at times.

03:49:54.820 --> 03:49:59.820
So often I'm describing concepts in a way

03:50:00.420 --> 03:50:03.140
that I built from the ground up.

03:50:03.140 --> 03:50:05.300
And so we misunderstand each other a lot.

03:50:05.300 --> 03:50:07.020
And he's floating in the clouds?

03:50:07.020 --> 03:50:08.860
Is that what you're saying?

03:50:08.860 --> 03:50:10.260
Not quite, but I think so.

03:50:10.260 --> 03:50:11.620
This concept of a Turing machine.

03:50:11.620 --> 03:50:15.420
So Turing machines, I would argue,

03:50:15.420 --> 03:50:18.540
and I think this is not, the Turing machine,

03:50:18.540 --> 03:50:21.060
the universe is not a Turing machine.

03:50:21.060 --> 03:50:23.260
Biology is not even a Turing machine, right?

03:50:23.260 --> 03:50:25.660
And because Turing machines don't evolve, right?

03:50:25.660 --> 03:50:27.740
There is this problem that people see

03:50:27.740 --> 03:50:30.140
Turing machines everywhere, but isn't it interesting?

03:50:30.140 --> 03:50:31.620
The universe gave rise to biology,

03:50:31.620 --> 03:50:32.860
that gave rise to intelligence,

03:50:32.860 --> 03:50:34.460
that gave rise to Alan Turing,

03:50:34.460 --> 03:50:37.100
who invented the abstraction of the Turing machine

03:50:37.100 --> 03:50:39.620
and allowed us to digitize.

03:50:39.620 --> 03:50:43.380
And so I've been looking for the mystery

03:50:43.380 --> 03:50:45.540
at the origin of life, the origin of intelligence,

03:50:45.540 --> 03:50:46.460
and the origin of this.

03:50:46.460 --> 03:50:48.380
And when I discussed with Yasha,

03:50:48.380 --> 03:50:50.260
I think Yasha, he was saying,

03:50:50.260 --> 03:50:51.700
well, the universe, of course,

03:50:51.700 --> 03:50:53.340
the universe is a Turing machine.

03:50:53.340 --> 03:50:56.300
Of course, there's a hyper computer there.

03:50:56.300 --> 03:50:59.900
And I think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms

03:50:59.900 --> 03:51:02.260
because of course it's possible for a Turing machine

03:51:02.260 --> 03:51:04.220
or computers to exist in the universe.

03:51:04.220 --> 03:51:05.540
We have them.

03:51:05.540 --> 03:51:07.780
But what I'm trying to understand is

03:51:07.780 --> 03:51:11.380
where did the transition of continuous discrete occur?

03:51:11.780 --> 03:51:14.900
And this is because of my general foolishness

03:51:14.900 --> 03:51:19.540
of understanding the continuous.

03:51:19.540 --> 03:51:23.540
But I guess what I'm trying to say is

03:51:23.540 --> 03:51:26.780
there were constructors before there were abstractors,

03:51:26.780 --> 03:51:28.780
because how did the universe

03:51:28.780 --> 03:51:31.460
abstract itself into existence?

03:51:31.460 --> 03:51:32.820
And it goes back to earlier saying,

03:51:32.820 --> 03:51:35.220
could the universe of intelligence have come first?

03:51:35.220 --> 03:51:37.260
What's a constructor, what's an abstractor?

03:51:37.260 --> 03:51:40.580
So the abstractor is the ability of, say,

03:51:40.580 --> 03:51:45.100
of Alan Turing and Gödel and Church

03:51:45.100 --> 03:51:48.980
to think about the mathematical universe

03:51:48.980 --> 03:51:51.940
and to label things, and then from those labels

03:51:51.940 --> 03:51:56.060
to come up with a set of axioms with those labels

03:51:56.060 --> 03:51:58.820
and to basically understand the universe mathematically

03:51:58.820 --> 03:52:01.180
and say, okay, I can label things.

03:52:01.180 --> 03:52:03.140
But where did the labeler come from?

03:52:03.140 --> 03:52:04.700
Where is the prime labeler?

03:52:04.700 --> 03:52:09.700
Even if the universe is not a Turing computer,

03:52:11.580 --> 03:52:14.060
does that negate the possibility

03:52:14.060 --> 03:52:16.300
that a Turing computer can simulate the universe?

03:52:16.300 --> 03:52:18.700
Like, just because the abstraction was formed

03:52:18.700 --> 03:52:22.700
at a later time, does that mean that abstraction,

03:52:22.700 --> 03:52:24.900
this is to our cellular automata conversation.

03:52:24.900 --> 03:52:26.700
You were taking away some of the magic

03:52:26.700 --> 03:52:29.420
from the cellular automata because very intelligent

03:52:29.420 --> 03:52:32.380
biological systems came up with that cellular automata.

03:52:32.380 --> 03:52:34.420
Well, this is where the existence is the default, right?

03:52:34.420 --> 03:52:36.300
Is it, does the fact that we exist

03:52:36.300 --> 03:52:38.140
and we can come up with a Turing machine,

03:52:38.140 --> 03:52:40.100
does that mean the universe has to be

03:52:40.100 --> 03:52:41.980
a Turing machine as well?

03:52:41.980 --> 03:52:44.060
But can it be a Turing machine though?

03:52:44.060 --> 03:52:46.900
That's a, so there has to be and can it be?

03:52:46.900 --> 03:52:48.740
Can it be, sure.

03:52:50.300 --> 03:52:53.620
I don't know, I don't understand if it has to be or not.

03:52:53.620 --> 03:52:54.780
Can it be?

03:52:54.780 --> 03:52:57.980
But can the universe have Turing machines in it?

03:52:57.980 --> 03:53:00.060
Sure, they do, they exist now.

03:53:01.020 --> 03:53:05.540
I'm wondering though, maybe, and this is random,

03:53:05.540 --> 03:53:07.460
things get really hairy,

03:53:07.500 --> 03:53:09.460
is I think the universe, maybe in the past,

03:53:09.460 --> 03:53:13.580
did not have the computational power that it has now.

03:53:17.940 --> 03:53:21.620
This is almost like a law of physics kind of,

03:53:21.620 --> 03:53:24.340
so the computational power is not,

03:53:27.140 --> 03:53:28.740
you can get some free lunch?

03:53:28.740 --> 03:53:30.700
Yeah, I mean, the fact that we now,

03:53:30.700 --> 03:53:32.380
we sit here in this period in time

03:53:32.380 --> 03:53:34.020
and we can imagine all these robots

03:53:34.020 --> 03:53:36.100
and all these machines and we built them.

03:53:36.140 --> 03:53:38.340
And so we can easily imagine going back in time

03:53:38.340 --> 03:53:39.820
that the universe was capable of having them,

03:53:39.820 --> 03:53:41.980
but I don't think it can.

03:53:41.980 --> 03:53:45.300
So the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally?

03:53:45.300 --> 03:53:46.860
And I think that's why,

03:53:46.860 --> 03:53:48.580
I don't want to go back to the time discussion,

03:53:48.580 --> 03:53:50.820
but I think it has some relationship with it.

03:53:50.820 --> 03:53:53.500
The universe is basically smarter now than it used to be

03:53:53.500 --> 03:53:57.100
and it's gonna continue getting smarter over time

03:53:57.100 --> 03:53:59.460
because of novelty generation

03:53:59.460 --> 03:54:01.020
and the ability to create objects

03:54:01.020 --> 03:54:02.500
within objects within objects.

03:54:02.500 --> 03:54:05.300
You know, there's a, perhaps as God in physics,

03:54:05.300 --> 03:54:07.940
there's this intuition of conservation.

03:54:07.940 --> 03:54:08.780
Yeah.

03:54:08.780 --> 03:54:10.620
That stuff is conserved, like you're not,

03:54:10.620 --> 03:54:13.780
you've always had all, everything,

03:54:13.780 --> 03:54:18.580
you're just rearranging books on the bookshelf through time.

03:54:18.580 --> 03:54:19.420
So, okay.

03:54:19.420 --> 03:54:21.700
But you're saying like new books are being written.

03:54:21.700 --> 03:54:23.020
Which law do you want to break?

03:54:23.020 --> 03:54:25.940
At the origin of the Big Bang,

03:54:25.940 --> 03:54:27.380
you had to break the second law

03:54:27.380 --> 03:54:28.500
because we got order for free.

03:54:28.500 --> 03:54:29.580
Yeah.

03:54:29.580 --> 03:54:30.420
Well, what I'm telling you now

03:54:30.420 --> 03:54:33.460
is that the energy isn't conserved from the universe.

03:54:33.460 --> 03:54:34.580
Oh, it was the second law.

03:54:34.580 --> 03:54:35.500
Okay, I got you.

03:54:35.500 --> 03:54:38.100
So because, but not in a mad way.

03:54:38.100 --> 03:54:43.100
Okay, so computation potentially is not conserved,

03:54:44.700 --> 03:54:46.500
which is a fascinating idea.

03:54:46.500 --> 03:54:49.260
Intelligence is not conserved.

03:54:50.340 --> 03:54:52.540
Complexity is not conserved.

03:54:54.700 --> 03:54:59.700
I suppose that's deeply connected to time being fundamental.

03:55:01.220 --> 03:55:03.220
The natural consequence of that

03:55:03.220 --> 03:55:05.340
is if time is fundamental

03:55:05.340 --> 03:55:09.700
and the universe is inflating in time, if you like,

03:55:09.700 --> 03:55:11.900
then there are one or two conservation laws

03:55:11.900 --> 03:55:14.100
that we need to have a look at.

03:55:14.100 --> 03:55:16.260
And I wonder if that means the total energy

03:55:16.260 --> 03:55:19.020
of the universe is actually increasing over time.

03:55:19.020 --> 03:55:21.140
And this may be completely ludicrous,

03:55:21.140 --> 03:55:25.340
but we do have all this dark energy that's,

03:55:25.340 --> 03:55:28.100
we have some anomalies, let's say,

03:55:28.100 --> 03:55:29.420
dark matter and dark energy.

03:55:29.420 --> 03:55:31.020
If we don't add them in,

03:55:31.020 --> 03:55:35.460
the galaxy is so dark matter, I think doesn't hold,

03:55:35.460 --> 03:55:37.020
you know, you need to hold the galaxies together

03:55:37.020 --> 03:55:38.940
and there's some other observational issues.

03:55:38.940 --> 03:55:40.660
Could dark energy just be time?

03:55:42.180 --> 03:55:44.540
So figuring out what dark energy is

03:55:44.540 --> 03:55:48.140
might give us some deep clues about this,

03:55:50.140 --> 03:55:53.180
not just time, but the consequences of time.

03:55:53.180 --> 03:55:55.340
So it could be that, I mean,

03:55:55.340 --> 03:55:57.260
I'm not saying there's perpetual motions allowed

03:55:57.260 --> 03:55:59.140
in this free lunch, but I'm saying

03:55:59.140 --> 03:56:02.900
if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric

03:56:02.900 --> 03:56:04.140
and it appears to be,

03:56:05.940 --> 03:56:08.740
and it's generating novelty and it appears to,

03:56:09.740 --> 03:56:13.540
couldn't that just be mechanistically how reality works?

03:56:13.540 --> 03:56:18.540
And therefore, I don't really like this idea that the,

03:56:18.740 --> 03:56:21.980
so I want to live in a deterministic universe

03:56:21.980 --> 03:56:25.220
that is undetermined, right?

03:56:25.220 --> 03:56:27.660
The only way I can do that is if time is fundamental.

03:56:28.580 --> 03:56:31.380
Because otherwise, all the rest of it is just sleight of hand

03:56:31.380 --> 03:56:33.300
because the physicist will say,

03:56:33.300 --> 03:56:35.340
yes, everything's deterministic,

03:56:35.340 --> 03:56:38.540
Newtonian mechanics is deterministic,

03:56:38.540 --> 03:56:40.540
quantum mechanics is deterministic,

03:56:40.540 --> 03:56:42.460
let's take the ever-ready in view.

03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:44.060
And then basically we can just draw out

03:56:44.060 --> 03:56:46.180
this massive universe branching,

03:56:46.180 --> 03:56:48.020
but it closes again and we get it all back.

03:56:48.020 --> 03:56:50.900
And don't worry, your feeling of free will is effective.

03:56:51.980 --> 03:56:53.540
But what the physicists are actually saying

03:56:53.540 --> 03:56:55.500
is the entire future is mapped out.

03:56:55.500 --> 03:56:59.140
And that is clearly problematical.

03:57:00.020 --> 03:57:01.540
And clearly.

03:57:03.380 --> 03:57:05.020
That's not so clear.

03:57:05.020 --> 03:57:05.860
Yeah.

03:57:05.860 --> 03:57:07.820
It's just problematic.

03:57:07.820 --> 03:57:10.220
Well, yeah, yeah, so it's-

03:57:10.220 --> 03:57:12.060
Because then maybe it's just the way it is.

03:57:12.060 --> 03:57:13.140
It's problematic to you,

03:57:13.140 --> 03:57:15.020
a particular creature along this timeline.

03:57:15.020 --> 03:57:16.460
I want to reduce the number of beliefs

03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:18.460
I need to understand the universe.

03:57:18.460 --> 03:57:19.740
So if time is fundamental,

03:57:19.740 --> 03:57:23.940
I don't need to have magic order at the beginning,

03:57:23.980 --> 03:57:25.580
and I don't need a second law.

03:57:25.580 --> 03:57:27.380
But you do need the magical belief

03:57:27.380 --> 03:57:28.780
that time is fundamental.

03:57:28.780 --> 03:57:32.180
Well, I need the observation that I'm seeing

03:57:32.180 --> 03:57:34.380
to be just the how it is all the way down.

03:57:34.380 --> 03:57:35.980
But the earth also looks flat

03:57:37.220 --> 03:57:40.780
if you agree with your observation.

03:57:40.780 --> 03:57:43.460
So we can't necessarily trust our observation.

03:57:43.460 --> 03:57:44.620
I know the earth isn't flat

03:57:44.620 --> 03:57:46.340
because I can send a satellite into space.

03:57:46.340 --> 03:57:47.380
No, but now you see,

03:57:47.380 --> 03:57:49.700
now you're using the tools of science

03:57:49.700 --> 03:57:51.260
and the technology of science.

03:57:51.260 --> 03:57:53.180
But I'm saying I'm going to do experiments

03:57:53.180 --> 03:57:55.100
that start to show.

03:57:55.100 --> 03:57:57.380
I mean, I think that it's worth,

03:57:57.380 --> 03:57:58.940
so if you can't,

03:57:58.940 --> 03:58:01.020
so if I cannot do an experiment

03:58:01.020 --> 03:58:04.620
or a thought experiment that will test this assumption,

03:58:04.620 --> 03:58:07.740
then the assumption is without merit really in the end.

03:58:07.740 --> 03:58:09.500
You know, that's fine.

03:58:09.500 --> 03:58:11.340
Yeah, so that's a beautiful idea

03:58:11.340 --> 03:58:12.420
you hold yourself to.

03:58:14.620 --> 03:58:18.740
Given that you think deeply in a philosophical way,

03:58:18.740 --> 03:58:21.820
you think about some of these really important issues

03:58:21.820 --> 03:58:25.860
and you have theoretical frameworks like assembly theory,

03:58:27.140 --> 03:58:29.980
it's really nice that you're always grounded

03:58:29.980 --> 03:58:31.340
with experiment.

03:58:31.340 --> 03:58:33.260
That's so refreshing.

03:58:33.260 --> 03:58:35.300
That's so beautifully refreshing.

03:58:35.300 --> 03:58:40.300
Now that we're holding you to the grounded in experiment,

03:58:40.580 --> 03:58:42.260
to the harsh truth of reality,

03:58:42.260 --> 03:58:45.180
let me ask the big ridiculous question.

03:58:45.180 --> 03:58:47.420
What is the meaning of this whole thing?

03:58:47.420 --> 03:58:48.940
What's the meaning of life?

03:58:48.940 --> 03:58:49.900
Why?

03:58:49.940 --> 03:58:52.660
This time is fundamental.

03:58:52.660 --> 03:58:54.900
It's marching forward.

03:58:54.900 --> 03:58:58.140
And along this long timeline,

03:58:58.140 --> 03:59:01.620
come along a bunch of descendants of apes

03:59:01.620 --> 03:59:05.620
that have come up with cellular automata and computers

03:59:05.620 --> 03:59:07.500
and now computers.

03:59:07.500 --> 03:59:08.340
Why?

03:59:09.820 --> 03:59:11.860
I have so many different answers to this question.

03:59:11.860 --> 03:59:13.860
It depends on what day.

03:59:13.860 --> 03:59:15.380
I would say that given the way

03:59:15.380 --> 03:59:16.540
of the conversation we had today,

03:59:16.540 --> 03:59:18.500
I'd say the meaning,

03:59:18.540 --> 03:59:19.900
well, we make our own meaning.

03:59:19.900 --> 03:59:20.980
I think that's fine.

03:59:20.980 --> 03:59:24.740
But I think the universe wants to explore

03:59:24.740 --> 03:59:28.660
every possible configuration that it's allowed us to explore.

03:59:28.660 --> 03:59:30.420
And this goes back to the kind of question

03:59:30.420 --> 03:59:32.020
that you're asking about Yasha

03:59:32.020 --> 03:59:35.220
and the existence and non-existence of things, right?

03:59:35.220 --> 03:59:37.100
So if the universe is a Turing machine,

03:59:37.100 --> 03:59:38.940
it's churning through a lot of states

03:59:40.220 --> 03:59:42.260
and you think about combinatorial theory

03:59:42.260 --> 03:59:45.260
before assembly theory, so everything is possible.

03:59:45.260 --> 03:59:47.540
What Yasha and I were saying is,

03:59:47.540 --> 03:59:49.860
well, not everything is possible.

03:59:49.860 --> 03:59:52.060
We don't see the combinatorial explosion.

03:59:52.060 --> 03:59:53.780
We see something else.

03:59:53.780 --> 03:59:57.740
And what we see is evidence of memory.

03:59:57.740 --> 04:00:00.540
So there clearly seems to be some interference

04:00:00.540 --> 04:00:04.180
between the combinatorial explosion of things

04:00:04.180 --> 04:00:06.180
and what the universe allows.

04:00:06.180 --> 04:00:08.260
And it's like this kind of constructive,

04:00:08.260 --> 04:00:09.820
destructive interference.

04:00:10.700 --> 04:00:13.660
So maybe the universe is not just about,

04:00:14.500 --> 04:00:18.220
it is assembling objects in space and time.

04:00:18.220 --> 04:00:22.140
And those objects are able to search more space and time.

04:00:22.140 --> 04:00:24.260
And the universe is just infinitely creative.

04:00:24.260 --> 04:00:27.300
And I guess I'm searching for why the universe

04:00:27.300 --> 04:00:28.380
is infinitely creative.

04:00:28.380 --> 04:00:29.460
Is it infinitely creative?

04:00:29.460 --> 04:00:31.380
And maybe the meaning is just simply to make

04:00:31.380 --> 04:00:34.780
as many objects, create as many things as possible.

04:00:34.780 --> 04:00:36.420
And I see a future of the universe

04:00:36.420 --> 04:00:38.700
that doesn't result in the heat death of the universe.

04:00:38.700 --> 04:00:42.820
The universe is gonna extract every ounce of creativity

04:00:42.820 --> 04:00:43.860
it can out of it.

04:00:43.860 --> 04:00:45.940
Cause that's what we see on earth, right?

04:00:45.940 --> 04:00:49.060
And if you think that almost like intelligence

04:00:49.060 --> 04:00:52.380
is not conserved, that maybe creativity isn't either.

04:00:52.380 --> 04:00:57.060
Maybe like, it's an infinite well.

04:00:57.060 --> 04:01:00.460
So like creativity is ultimately tied to novelty.

04:01:00.460 --> 04:01:03.740
You're coming up with cool new configurations of things.

04:01:03.740 --> 04:01:06.340
And maybe that just can continue indefinitely.

04:01:06.340 --> 04:01:09.940
And this human species that was created along the way

04:01:09.940 --> 04:01:13.380
is probably just one method,

04:01:13.380 --> 04:01:16.620
like that's able to ask the universe about itself.

04:01:16.620 --> 04:01:19.500
It's just one way to explore creativity.

04:01:19.500 --> 04:01:22.700
Maybe there's other meta levels on top of that.

04:01:22.700 --> 04:01:24.900
Like obviously as a collective intelligence

04:01:24.900 --> 04:01:26.100
we'll create organisms.

04:01:26.100 --> 04:01:31.100
Maybe there'll be organisms that ask themselves questions

04:01:31.380 --> 04:01:36.380
about themselves in a deeper, bigger picture way

04:01:36.780 --> 04:01:38.220
that we humans do.

04:01:38.260 --> 04:01:39.860
First to ask questions about the humans

04:01:39.860 --> 04:01:42.980
and then construct some kind of hybrid systems

04:01:42.980 --> 04:01:45.540
that ask themselves about the collective aspect.

04:01:45.540 --> 04:01:47.140
Just like some weird stacking

04:01:47.140 --> 04:01:49.140
that we can't even imagine yet.

04:01:49.140 --> 04:01:49.980
And that's stacking.

04:01:49.980 --> 04:01:51.460
I mean, I have discussed this stacking a lot

04:01:51.460 --> 04:01:54.140
with Sarah Walker who's a professor of physics

04:01:54.140 --> 04:01:57.500
and astrobiology at ASU.

04:01:57.500 --> 04:02:02.100
And we argue about how creative the universe is gonna be

04:02:02.100 --> 04:02:03.900
and is it as deterministic as all that?

04:02:03.900 --> 04:02:07.660
Because I think she's more of a free will thinker

04:02:07.660 --> 04:02:10.100
and I'm of a less free will thinker.

04:02:10.100 --> 04:02:12.260
But I think we're beginning to converge

04:02:12.260 --> 04:02:14.020
and understanding that

04:02:14.020 --> 04:02:16.020
because there's simply a missing understanding.

04:02:16.020 --> 04:02:19.060
Right now we don't understand how the universe,

04:02:19.060 --> 04:02:21.380
we don't know what rules the universe has

04:02:21.380 --> 04:02:23.500
to allow the universe to contemplate itself.

04:02:23.500 --> 04:02:25.180
So asking the meaning of it

04:02:25.180 --> 04:02:28.300
before we even know what those rules are is premature.

04:02:28.300 --> 04:02:30.700
But my guess is that it's not meaningless

04:02:30.700 --> 04:02:32.100
and it isn't just about that.

04:02:32.100 --> 04:02:33.900
And there are three levels of meanings.

04:02:33.900 --> 04:02:35.860
Obviously the universe wants us to do stuff.

04:02:35.860 --> 04:02:36.940
We're interacting with each other

04:02:36.940 --> 04:02:38.580
so we create meaning in our own society

04:02:38.580 --> 04:02:41.260
and our own interactions with humanity.

04:02:41.260 --> 04:02:44.500
But I do think there is something else going on.

04:02:44.500 --> 04:02:47.700
But because reality is so weird,

04:02:47.700 --> 04:02:50.020
we're just scratching at that.

04:02:50.020 --> 04:02:52.980
And I think that we have to make the experiments better

04:02:52.980 --> 04:02:56.620
and we have to perhaps join across

04:02:56.620 --> 04:02:58.660
not just for the computation lists.

04:02:58.660 --> 04:03:01.180
And what I tried to do with Yasha is meet him halfway.

04:03:01.180 --> 04:03:03.260
Say, well, what happens if I become a computation list?

04:03:03.260 --> 04:03:04.300
What do I gain?

04:03:04.300 --> 04:03:05.700
A lot it turns out

04:03:05.700 --> 04:03:08.220
because I can make Turing machines in the universe.

04:03:08.220 --> 04:03:09.900
Because on the one hand, I'm making computers

04:03:09.900 --> 04:03:12.060
which are state machines inspired by Turing.

04:03:12.060 --> 04:03:14.620
On the other hand, I'm saying they can't exist.

04:03:14.620 --> 04:03:16.980
Well, clearly I can't have my cake and eat it.

04:03:16.980 --> 04:03:19.020
So there's something weird going on there.

04:03:19.020 --> 04:03:20.620
So then did the universe have to make

04:03:20.620 --> 04:03:22.660
a continuous to discrete transition

04:03:22.660 --> 04:03:23.860
or is the universe just discrete?

04:03:23.860 --> 04:03:25.420
It's probably just discrete.

04:03:25.420 --> 04:03:27.540
So if it's just discrete, then there are,

04:03:27.540 --> 04:03:31.300
I will then give Yasha his Turing-like property

04:03:31.300 --> 04:03:32.140
in the universe.

04:03:32.140 --> 04:03:33.660
But maybe there's something else below it

04:03:33.660 --> 04:03:35.500
which is the constructor that constructs

04:03:35.500 --> 04:03:37.820
the Turing machine that then constructs,

04:03:37.820 --> 04:03:40.220
you know, it's a bit like the,

04:03:40.220 --> 04:03:42.940
you generate a computing system

04:03:42.940 --> 04:03:44.660
that then is able to build an abstraction

04:03:44.660 --> 04:03:46.660
that then recognizes,

04:03:46.660 --> 04:03:48.540
it can make a generalizable abstraction

04:03:48.540 --> 04:03:50.780
because human beings with mathematics

04:03:50.780 --> 04:03:55.220
have been able to go on and build physical computers,

04:03:55.220 --> 04:03:57.100
if that makes any sense.

04:03:57.100 --> 04:03:58.140
And I think that's the meaning.

04:03:58.140 --> 04:04:00.860
I think that's, you know, as far as we can,

04:04:00.860 --> 04:04:02.420
the meaning will be further elucidated

04:04:02.420 --> 04:04:03.700
with further experiments.

04:04:06.820 --> 04:04:08.460
Well, you mentioned Sarah.

04:04:08.460 --> 04:04:11.460
I think you and Sarah Walker

04:04:11.460 --> 04:04:14.500
are just these fascinating human beings.

04:04:14.500 --> 04:04:18.580
I'm really fortunate to have the opportunity

04:04:18.580 --> 04:04:20.180
to be in your presence, to study your work,

04:04:20.180 --> 04:04:21.700
to follow along with your work.

04:04:21.700 --> 04:04:23.780
I'm big, I'm a big fan.

04:04:23.780 --> 04:04:25.620
Like I told you offline,

04:04:25.620 --> 04:04:27.420
I hope we get a chance to talk again

04:04:27.420 --> 04:04:29.940
with perhaps just the two of us,

04:04:29.940 --> 04:04:30.860
but also with Sarah.

04:04:30.860 --> 04:04:35.380
That's a fascinating dynamic for people who haven't heard.

04:04:35.380 --> 04:04:38.260
I suppose on Clubhouse is where I heard you guys talk,

04:04:38.260 --> 04:04:39.980
but you have an incredible dynamic.

04:04:39.980 --> 04:04:43.220
And I also can't wait to hear you and Josje talk.

04:04:43.220 --> 04:04:48.220
So I think if there's some point in this predetermined

04:04:48.220 --> 04:04:50.220
or yet to be determined future,

04:04:51.460 --> 04:04:54.940
where the three of us, you and Sarah,

04:04:54.940 --> 04:04:57.980
or the four of us with Josje could meet and talk

04:04:57.980 --> 04:04:59.380
would be a beautiful future.

04:05:00.340 --> 04:05:02.180
I look forward to most futures,

04:05:02.180 --> 04:05:04.660
but I look forward to that one in particular.

04:05:04.660 --> 04:05:06.140
Lee, thank you so much

04:05:06.140 --> 04:05:08.340
for spending your valuable time with me today.

04:05:08.340 --> 04:05:10.700
Thanks, Lex, it's been a pleasure.

04:05:10.700 --> 04:05:13.660
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin.

04:05:13.660 --> 04:05:15.180
To support this podcast,

04:05:15.180 --> 04:05:18.140
please check out our sponsors in the description.

04:05:18.140 --> 04:05:20.420
And now let me leave you with some words

04:05:20.420 --> 04:05:22.460
from the mad scientist Rick Sanchez

04:05:22.460 --> 04:05:23.980
of Rick and Morty fame.

04:05:25.140 --> 04:05:27.540
To live is to risk it all.

04:05:28.460 --> 04:05:31.820
Otherwise, you're just an inner chunk

04:05:31.820 --> 04:05:34.220
of randomly assembled molecules

04:05:34.220 --> 04:05:36.860
drifting wherever the universe blows you.

04:05:39.140 --> 04:05:41.780
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
