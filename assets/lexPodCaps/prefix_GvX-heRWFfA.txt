00:00.000 --> 00:01.740
the war continues after the battle's end.

00:01.740 --> 00:03.540
This is something that's hard for Americans to understand.

00:03.540 --> 00:05.160
Our system is built with the presumption

00:05.160 --> 00:07.620
when war is over, when we sign a piece of paper,

00:07.620 --> 00:08.700
everyone can go home.

00:09.580 --> 00:10.680
It's not what happens.

00:12.820 --> 00:15.380
The following is a conversation with Jeremy Suri,

00:15.380 --> 00:17.940
a historian at UT Austin.

00:17.940 --> 00:19.820
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.700
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:21.700 --> 00:23.040
in the description.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.840
And now, dear friends, here's Jeremy Suri.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.220
What is the main idea,

00:29.840 --> 00:31.760
the main case that you make in your new book,

00:31.760 --> 00:33.440
Civil War by Other Means,

00:33.440 --> 00:36.520
America's Long and Unfinished Fight for Democracy?

00:36.520 --> 00:39.480
So our democratic institutions in the United States,

00:39.480 --> 00:41.480
they are filled with many virtues

00:41.480 --> 00:44.200
and many elements in their design

00:44.200 --> 00:47.080
that improve our society and allow for innovation,

00:47.080 --> 00:48.640
but they also have many flaws in them,

00:48.640 --> 00:51.520
as any institutions created by human beings have.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.480
And the flaws in our institutions

00:53.480 --> 00:57.840
go back to a number of judgments and perspectives

00:57.840 --> 01:01.300
that people in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries had.

01:01.300 --> 01:04.260
And those flaws have been built into our institutions

01:04.260 --> 01:07.180
and they continue to hinder innovation

01:07.180 --> 01:08.740
and growth in our society.

01:08.740 --> 01:11.700
Three of the flaws that I emphasize in this book

01:11.700 --> 01:14.160
are flaws of exclusion,

01:14.160 --> 01:15.780
the ways our institutions exclude people,

01:15.780 --> 01:18.580
not just African-Americans, many different groups,

01:19.460 --> 01:22.780
the ways our institutions also give power

01:22.780 --> 01:24.860
to certain people who have position

01:24.860 --> 01:28.580
rather than skill or intelligence or quality.

01:28.580 --> 01:29.740
And third, and most of all,

01:29.740 --> 01:33.380
the ways our institutions embed certain myths in our society,

01:33.380 --> 01:36.300
myths that prevent us from gaining the knowledge

01:36.300 --> 01:38.000
we need to improve our world.

01:38.000 --> 01:38.900
In all of these ways,

01:38.900 --> 01:43.660
our democracy is hindered by the false reverence

01:43.660 --> 01:46.720
for institutions that actually need to be reformed,

01:46.720 --> 01:48.940
just as we need to highlight the good elements of them.

01:48.940 --> 01:50.220
That's really what my book is about.

01:50.220 --> 01:53.700
And then the myth, the false reverence,

01:53.700 --> 01:54.900
what are we talking about there?

01:54.900 --> 01:57.120
So there's a way in which we believe

01:57.120 --> 01:59.300
that if we love our country,

01:59.300 --> 02:01.980
it's somehow wrong to criticize our institutions.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.920
I believe if you love your country,

02:03.920 --> 02:05.340
you want to encourage your institutions

02:05.340 --> 02:06.260
to get better and better.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.960
I love my university where I work,

02:07.960 --> 02:08.800
but I want it to be better.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.820
We have many flaws.

02:09.820 --> 02:10.660
I love my family,

02:10.660 --> 02:12.180
but I'm constantly telling family members

02:12.180 --> 02:13.980
how they can be better.

02:13.980 --> 02:17.420
That's what true knowledge leadership is about,

02:17.420 --> 02:18.740
not just cheerleading.

02:18.740 --> 02:20.060
What's the counterpoint to that?

02:20.060 --> 02:24.260
Because the other extreme is a deep,

02:24.260 --> 02:28.220
all-encompassing cynicism towards institutions.

02:28.220 --> 02:32.180
So for me, I like the idea of loving America,

02:32.180 --> 02:34.700
which seems to be sometimes a politicized statement

02:34.700 --> 02:38.660
these days that you believe in the ideals of this country.

02:38.660 --> 02:42.900
That seems to be either a naive or a political statement

02:42.900 --> 02:43.860
the way it's interpreted.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.480
So the flip side of that,

02:45.480 --> 02:48.100
having a healthy skepticism of institutions is good,

02:48.100 --> 02:51.900
but having a complete paralyzing cynicism seems to be bad.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.740
Absolutely, both are ahistorical positions.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.240
What I try to do as a historian

02:56.240 --> 02:57.700
is work in between those spaces.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.020
The virtue is in the middle ground,

03:00.020 --> 03:01.340
for better or for worse.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.660
And what we have to recognize

03:03.660 --> 03:06.180
is that our institutions are necessary.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.300
There's a reason government exists.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.460
There's a reason our union was created.

03:11.460 --> 03:14.760
That's what Abraham Lincoln was heroically fighting for.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.420
So we have to believe in our union.

03:16.420 --> 03:17.900
We have to believe in our government.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.100
And we as business people, as intellectuals,

03:20.100 --> 03:23.180
we have to be part of the solution, not the problem.

03:23.180 --> 03:26.060
But that doesn't mean just ignoring

03:26.060 --> 03:27.460
the deep flaws in our institutions,

03:27.460 --> 03:30.420
even if we find personally ways to get around them.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.820
What really worries me is that there are a lot of

03:32.820 --> 03:36.220
very intelligent, well-intentioned people in our society

03:36.220 --> 03:38.740
who have figured out how to live with the flaws

03:38.740 --> 03:40.060
in our institutions,

03:40.060 --> 03:41.580
rather than how to use their skills

03:41.580 --> 03:43.760
to correct the flaws in our institutions.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.460
There's folks like somebody that lives next door to me,

03:46.460 --> 03:48.260
like a malice as an anarchist.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.820
Philosophically, maybe more than practically,

03:51.820 --> 03:53.980
just sort of argues for that position.

03:54.820 --> 03:57.300
It's an interesting thought experiment, I would say.

03:57.300 --> 04:01.080
And so if you have these flaws as institutions,

04:01.080 --> 04:04.020
one thing to do, as the communists did

04:04.020 --> 04:05.260
at the beginning of the 20th century,

04:05.260 --> 04:08.220
is to burn the thing down and start anew.

04:08.220 --> 04:12.080
And the other is to fix from within.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.420
One step, one slow step at a time.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.420
What's the case for both?

04:17.260 --> 04:18.100
From a history perspective.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.060
Sure, so historically, there has always been an urge

04:21.060 --> 04:22.860
to burn down the institutions and start again,

04:22.860 --> 04:24.540
start with a blank slate.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.860
The historical record is that almost never works.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.900
Because what happens when you destroy the institutions,

04:28.900 --> 04:32.260
you gave the example of the Bolshevik Revolution.

04:32.260 --> 04:34.180
When you destroy the institutions,

04:34.180 --> 04:37.480
all you do is in the jungle that's left behind,

04:37.480 --> 04:40.140
you give advantages to those who are the most powerful.

04:40.140 --> 04:42.900
Institutions always place certain limits

04:42.900 --> 04:44.800
upon the most powerful in the jungle.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.240
If you go back to the jungle,

04:47.080 --> 04:48.280
the most powerful are actually going to have

04:48.280 --> 04:50.120
the most influence and most control.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.200
So the revolutionaries who are usually the vulnerable

04:53.200 --> 04:55.280
turn out to then be the victims of the revolution.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.760
And this is exactly what we saw with the French Revolution,

04:57.760 --> 04:59.000
with the Russian Revolution.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.900
So the record for that is not a great record.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.720
There still might be times to do that,

05:02.720 --> 05:04.800
but I think we should be very cautious about that.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.600
The record for working through institutions

05:06.600 --> 05:08.080
is a much better record.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.840
Now, what we have to be careful about

05:09.840 --> 05:11.240
is as we're working through institutions,

05:11.240 --> 05:13.180
not to become bought into them,

05:13.180 --> 05:15.480
not to become of those institutions.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.840
So what I've written about in this book and in other books,

05:17.840 --> 05:19.880
my book on Henry Kissinger, for example,

05:19.880 --> 05:22.160
is how it's important when in an institution

05:22.160 --> 05:24.520
to still bring an outsider perspective.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.640
I believe in being an inside outsider.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.760
And I think most of your listeners are inside outsiders.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.100
There are people who care about what's going on inside,

05:32.100 --> 05:34.160
but they're bringing some new ideas from the outside.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.400
I think the correct statement to say

05:35.400 --> 05:36.420
is most of the listeners,

05:36.420 --> 05:40.800
most people aspire to be inside or outsiders,

05:40.800 --> 05:43.020
but we, human nature is such

05:43.020 --> 05:45.900
that we easily become insider insiders.

05:45.900 --> 05:50.160
So like, we like that idea, but the reality is,

05:50.160 --> 05:53.540
and I've been very fortunate because of this podcast

05:53.540 --> 05:56.740
to talk to certain folks that live in certain bubbles.

05:57.620 --> 06:02.620
And it's very hard to know when you're in a bubble

06:03.520 --> 06:06.340
that you should get out of the bubble of thought.

06:06.340 --> 06:08.540
And that's a really tricky thing because like, yeah,

06:08.540 --> 06:11.900
when you're, whether it's politics, whether it's science,

06:11.940 --> 06:16.080
whether it's any pursuits in life,

06:17.100 --> 06:19.420
because everybody around you, all your friends,

06:19.420 --> 06:20.740
you have like a little rat race

06:20.740 --> 06:22.340
and you're competing with each other.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.180
And then you get a promotion, you get excited,

06:24.180 --> 06:26.740
and you can see how you can get more and more power.

06:26.740 --> 06:31.620
It's not like a dark, cynical rat race, it's fun.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.220
That's the process of life.

06:33.220 --> 06:38.220
And then you forget that you just collectively

06:38.620 --> 06:41.140
have created a set of rules for the game that you're playing.

06:41.140 --> 06:43.820
You forget that this game doesn't have to have these rules.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.900
You can break them.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.980
This happens in like, in Wall Street,

06:48.980 --> 06:51.900
like the financial system, everybody starts to like,

06:51.900 --> 06:54.580
collectively agree on a set of rules that they play

06:54.580 --> 06:55.780
and they don't realize like,

06:55.780 --> 06:57.460
we don't have to be playing this game.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.500
It's tough, it's really tough.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.060
It takes a special kind of human being

07:01.060 --> 07:04.780
as opposed to being anti-establishment on everything,

07:04.780 --> 07:07.860
which also gets a lot of attention,

07:07.860 --> 07:11.220
but being just enough anti-establishment

07:11.220 --> 07:14.900
to figure out ideas how to improve the establishment.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.020
That's such a tricky place to operate.

07:17.020 --> 07:17.860
I agree.

07:17.860 --> 07:20.140
I like the word iconoclastic.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.540
I think it's important to be an iconoclast,

07:22.540 --> 07:27.540
which is to say you love ideas, you're serious about ideas,

07:27.540 --> 07:30.620
but you're never comfortable with consensus.

07:30.620 --> 07:31.980
And I write about that in this book.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.100
I've written about that actually a lot

07:33.100 --> 07:34.140
in the New York Times too.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.980
I think consensus is overstated.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.300
As someone who's half Jewish and half Hindu,

07:41.300 --> 07:43.220
I don't wanna live in a society where everyone agrees,

07:43.220 --> 07:45.940
cause my guess is they're gonna come after people like me.

07:45.940 --> 07:48.500
I wanna live in a society that's pluralistic.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.380
This is what Abraham Lincoln was really fighting for

07:50.380 --> 07:51.220
in the Civil War.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.500
It's what the Civil War is really about.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.860
And what my book's about, which is that we need a society

07:55.860 --> 07:58.620
where institutions encourage, as you say,

07:58.620 --> 08:00.180
different modes of thought

08:00.180 --> 08:01.740
and respect different modes of thought

08:01.740 --> 08:03.300
and work through disagreement.

08:03.300 --> 08:06.060
So a society should not be a society where everyone agrees.

08:06.060 --> 08:07.660
A democratic society should be a society

08:08.460 --> 08:10.100
where people disagree, but can still work together.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.220
That's the Lincoln vision.

08:12.220 --> 08:13.220
And how do you get there?

08:13.220 --> 08:15.500
I think you get there by having a historical perspective,

08:15.500 --> 08:18.100
always knowing that no matter what moment you're in

08:18.100 --> 08:20.900
and no matter what room you're in with really smart people,

08:20.900 --> 08:22.740
there are always things they're missing.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.500
We know that as historians.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.820
No one is clairvoyant.

08:25.820 --> 08:28.020
And the iconoclast is looking for the things

08:28.020 --> 08:31.020
that have been forgotten, the silences in the room.

08:31.020 --> 08:35.020
And also I wonder what kind of skill,

08:35.020 --> 08:38.260
what kind of processes are required for the iconoclast

08:38.260 --> 08:41.500
to reveal what is missing to the rest of the room.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.220
Because it's not just shouting with a megaphone

08:44.220 --> 08:45.060
that something is missing

08:45.060 --> 08:47.060
because nobody will listen to you.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.420
You have to convince them.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.260
Right.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.220
It's honestly where I have trouble myself

08:51.220 --> 08:54.020
because I often find myself in that iconoclastic role

08:54.020 --> 08:56.260
and people don't like to hear it.

08:56.260 --> 08:59.940
I like to believe that people are acting out of goodwill,

08:59.940 --> 09:01.260
which I think they usually are,

09:01.260 --> 09:02.820
and that people are open to new ideas.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.380
But you find very quickly,

09:04.420 --> 09:06.140
even those who you think are open-minded,

09:06.140 --> 09:08.820
once they've committed themselves and put their money

09:08.820 --> 09:10.740
and their reputation on the line,

09:10.740 --> 09:11.900
they don't want to hear otherwise.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.340
So in a sense, what you say is bigger

09:14.340 --> 09:16.260
than even being an iconoclast.

09:16.260 --> 09:19.140
It's being able to persuade and work with people

09:19.140 --> 09:20.780
who are afraid of your ideas.

09:20.780 --> 09:23.060
Yeah, I think the key is like in conversations

09:23.060 --> 09:26.060
is to get people out of a defensive position.

09:26.060 --> 09:29.300
Like make them realize we're on the same side

09:29.300 --> 09:30.540
we're brothers and sisters.

09:30.540 --> 09:34.220
And from that place, I think you just raise the question.

09:35.220 --> 09:38.900
It's a little thought that just lands.

09:38.900 --> 09:42.140
And then I've noticed this time and time again,

09:42.140 --> 09:43.820
just a little subtle thing.

09:43.820 --> 09:47.340
And then months later, it percolates somewhere in the mind.

09:47.340 --> 09:50.020
It's like, all right, that little doubt.

09:50.020 --> 09:53.300
Because I also realized in these battles,

09:53.300 --> 09:54.780
especially political battles,

09:55.660 --> 10:00.660
people often don't have folks on their side

10:00.940 --> 10:03.300
like that they can really trust.

10:04.180 --> 10:07.220
As a fellow human being to challenge them.

10:07.220 --> 10:08.980
That's a very difficult role to be in.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.660
And because in these battles,

10:10.660 --> 10:13.220
you kind of have a tribe and you have a set of ideas

10:13.220 --> 10:15.100
and there's another tribe and you have a set of ideas.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.060
And when somebody says something counter to your viewpoint,

10:18.060 --> 10:19.980
you almost always want to put them in the other tribe

10:19.980 --> 10:23.540
as opposed to having truly listening to another person.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.540
That takes skill, but ultimately I think

10:26.540 --> 10:28.460
that's the way to bridge these divides

10:28.460 --> 10:31.260
is having these kinds of conversations.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.580
That's why I'm actually, again,

10:33.580 --> 10:36.140
optimistically believe in the power of social media

10:36.140 --> 10:38.420
to do that if you design it well.

10:38.420 --> 10:41.980
But currently the battle rages on, on Twitter.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.820
Well, I think what you're getting at,

10:43.820 --> 10:46.940
which is so important, is storytelling.

10:46.940 --> 10:51.220
And all the great leaders that I've studied,

10:51.220 --> 10:53.700
some of whom are in this book, some of whom are not.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.820
Whether they're politicians, social activists,

10:57.500 --> 11:01.620
technologists, it's the story that gets people in.

11:01.620 --> 11:04.060
People don't respond to an argument.

11:04.060 --> 11:06.900
We're trained, at least in the United States,

11:06.900 --> 11:09.380
we're often trained to argue.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.500
You're told in a class, okay,

11:11.500 --> 11:13.660
this part of the room, take this position.

11:13.660 --> 11:15.300
This part of the room, take this position.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.620
And that's helpful because it forces you

11:16.620 --> 11:18.420
to see different sides of the argument.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.980
But in fact, those on one side never convinced those

11:20.980 --> 11:22.860
on the other side through argument.

11:22.860 --> 11:25.380
It's through a story that people can identify with.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.780
It's when you bring your argument to life in human terms.

11:28.780 --> 11:32.740
And someone again like Abraham Lincoln was a master at that.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.420
He told stories.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.940
He found ways to disarm people and to move them

11:37.940 --> 11:40.620
without their even realizing they were being moved.

11:42.660 --> 11:47.660
Yeah, not make it a debate, make it tell a story.

11:48.900 --> 11:49.740
That's fascinating.

11:49.740 --> 11:52.500
Because yes, some of the most convincing politicians,

11:52.500 --> 11:54.060
I don't feel like they're arguing a point.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.780
They're just telling a story.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.820
And then it gets in there, right?

11:57.820 --> 11:58.660
That's right, that's right.

11:58.660 --> 12:01.620
I mean, when we look at what Zelensky has done in Ukraine

12:01.620 --> 12:03.700
in response to the Russian invasion,

12:03.700 --> 12:06.460
and I know you were there on the front lines yourself.

12:07.580 --> 12:10.340
It's not that he's arguing a position that persuaded us.

12:10.340 --> 12:13.020
We already believe what we believed about Russia.

12:13.020 --> 12:16.100
But he's bringing the story of Ukrainian suffering to life

12:16.100 --> 12:18.980
and making us see the behavior of the Russians

12:18.980 --> 12:23.260
that is moving opinion around the world.

12:23.260 --> 12:24.460
Well, the interesting stuff,

12:24.460 --> 12:27.460
sometimes it's not actually the story told by the person,

12:27.460 --> 12:29.380
but the story told about the person.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.020
And some of that could be propaganda.

12:31.020 --> 12:35.020
Some of that could be legitimate stories,

12:35.020 --> 12:36.020
which is the fascinating thing.

12:36.020 --> 12:39.220
The power of story is the very power

12:39.220 --> 12:43.220
that's leveraged by propaganda to convince the populace.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.660
But the idea, one of the most powerful ideas

12:45.660 --> 12:47.940
when I traveled in Ukraine and in general,

12:47.940 --> 12:51.500
to me personally, the idea that President Zelensky

12:51.540 --> 12:55.220
stayed in Kiev in the early days of war,

12:55.220 --> 12:57.580
when everybody, from his inner circle

12:57.580 --> 12:59.740
to the United States, everybody in the West,

12:59.740 --> 13:02.020
and NATO, everybody was telling him.

13:02.020 --> 13:03.700
And even on the Russian side,

13:03.700 --> 13:07.140
I assume they thought he would leave, he would escape.

13:07.140 --> 13:07.980
And he didn't.

13:09.300 --> 13:12.180
From foolishness or from heroism, I don't know.

13:12.180 --> 13:15.620
But that's a story that I think united a country.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.700
And it's such a small thing, but it's powerful.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.460
It's the most basic of all human stories,

13:20.460 --> 13:22.540
the story of human courage.

13:22.540 --> 13:26.140
And I remember watching his social media feed on that.

13:26.140 --> 13:29.580
And he was standing outside, not even in a bunker,

13:29.580 --> 13:32.300
standing outside in Kiev as the Russian forces

13:32.300 --> 13:34.380
are attacking and saying, I'm here,

13:34.380 --> 13:36.700
and this minister is here, and this minister is here.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.140
We're not corrupt.

13:38.140 --> 13:41.060
We're not stooges of the Americans who told us to leave.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.380
We're staying because we care about Ukraine.

13:43.380 --> 13:46.260
And the story of courage, that's the story

13:46.260 --> 13:50.020
that babies grow up seeing their parents as courageous.

13:50.020 --> 13:51.980
It's the most natural of all stories.

13:51.980 --> 13:53.860
And that's also the stories for better or worse

13:53.860 --> 13:55.740
that are told throughout history.

13:55.740 --> 13:56.780
Yeah.

13:56.780 --> 14:01.780
Because stories of courage and stories of evil,

14:02.140 --> 14:05.580
those are the two extremes are the ones that are kind of,

14:05.580 --> 14:08.500
it's a nice mechanism to tell the stories of wars,

14:09.740 --> 14:13.300
of conflicts, of struggles, all of it.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.380
Yeah, yeah.

14:14.380 --> 14:15.540
The tension between those two.

14:15.540 --> 14:18.140
And the reason I believe studying history

14:18.140 --> 14:20.420
and writing about history is so essential

14:20.420 --> 14:22.900
is because it gives us more stories.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.100
The problem with much of our world, I think,

14:25.100 --> 14:27.020
is that we're confronted by data.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.980
We're confronted by information.

14:28.980 --> 14:30.620
And of course it's valuable,

14:30.620 --> 14:34.540
but it's easy to manipulate or misuse information.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.500
It's the stories that give us a structure.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.180
It's the stories where we find morality.

14:38.180 --> 14:40.740
It's the stories where we find political value.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.980
And what do you get from studying history?

14:42.980 --> 14:45.700
You learn more stories about more people.

14:45.700 --> 14:49.020
Yeah, I'm a sucker for courage, for stories of courage.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.380
Like I've been in too many rooms.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.540
I've often seen too many people

14:55.700 --> 14:58.780
sort of in subtle ways sacrifice their integrity

14:58.780 --> 14:59.940
and did nothing.

14:59.940 --> 15:04.940
And people that step up when the opinion is unpopular

15:05.580 --> 15:07.860
and they do something where they really put themselves

15:07.860 --> 15:09.220
on the line, whether it's their money,

15:09.220 --> 15:11.580
whether it's their wellbeing, I don't know.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.460
That gives me hope about humanity.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.540
And of course, during the war like Ukraine,

15:16.540 --> 15:18.540
you see that more and more.

15:18.540 --> 15:21.220
Now other people have a very cynical perspective of it

15:21.220 --> 15:23.220
that's saying, oh, those are just narratives

15:23.220 --> 15:26.420
that are constructed for propaganda purposes and so on.

15:26.420 --> 15:27.980
But I've seen it with my own eyes.

15:27.980 --> 15:31.460
There's heroes out there, both small and big.

15:31.460 --> 15:34.140
So just regular citizens and leaders.

15:34.140 --> 15:36.340
One set of heroes I learned about writing this book

15:36.340 --> 15:38.100
that I didn't know about that I should have

15:38.100 --> 15:42.580
are more than 100,000 former slaves

15:42.580 --> 15:45.020
who become Union soldiers during the Civil War.

15:45.020 --> 15:46.060
It's an extraordinary story.

15:46.060 --> 15:48.460
We think of it as North versus South,

15:48.460 --> 15:51.380
white Northern troops versus white Southern troops.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.460
There are, as I said, more than 100,000 slaves,

15:54.460 --> 15:59.180
no education, never anything other than slaves

15:59.180 --> 16:02.580
who flee their plantations, join the Union Army.

16:02.580 --> 16:03.780
And what I found in the research

16:03.780 --> 16:05.180
and other historians have written about this too

16:05.180 --> 16:08.260
is they become some of the most courageous soldiers

16:08.260 --> 16:09.940
because they know what they're fighting for,

16:09.940 --> 16:12.300
but there's something more to it than that.

16:12.300 --> 16:15.620
It seems in their stories that there is a humanity,

16:15.620 --> 16:18.220
a human desire for freedom

16:18.220 --> 16:21.580
and a human desire to improve oneself,

16:21.580 --> 16:23.460
even for those who have been denied,

16:23.460 --> 16:26.340
even the most basic rights for all of their lives.

16:26.340 --> 16:30.220
And I think that story should be inspiring to all of us

16:30.220 --> 16:31.460
as a story of courage,

16:31.460 --> 16:33.380
because we all deal with difficulties,

16:33.380 --> 16:36.180
but none of us are starting from slavery.

16:36.180 --> 16:38.860
That's really powerful that that flame,

16:38.860 --> 16:41.700
the longing for freedom can't be extinguished

16:41.740 --> 16:43.220
through the generations of slavery.

16:43.220 --> 16:44.340
So that's something you talk about.

16:44.340 --> 16:46.380
There's some deep sense in which

16:47.620 --> 16:51.300
while the war was in part about slavery,

16:51.300 --> 16:56.300
it's not the slaves themselves fought for their freedom

16:57.140 --> 16:58.500
and they won their freedom.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.100
I don't think it's a war about slavery.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.780
I think it's a war about freedom.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.900
Because if you say it's a war about slavery,

17:03.900 --> 17:05.660
then it sounds like it's an argument

17:05.660 --> 17:10.020
between the slave masters and the other white guys

17:10.020 --> 17:11.340
who didn't want slavery to exist.

17:11.340 --> 17:13.740
And of course that argument did exist,

17:13.740 --> 17:16.860
but it was a war over freedom,

17:16.860 --> 17:20.860
especially after 1863 into the second year of the war

17:20.860 --> 17:23.220
when Lincoln, because of war pressures,

17:24.540 --> 17:26.540
signs Emancipation Proclamation,

17:26.540 --> 17:30.180
which therefore says that the contraband,

17:30.180 --> 17:33.580
the property of Southerners, i.e. their slaves,

17:33.580 --> 17:37.180
will now be freed and brought into the Union Army.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.780
That makes it about freedom.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.540
Already the slaves were leaving the plantations.

17:41.540 --> 17:42.940
They knew what was going on

17:42.940 --> 17:44.300
and they were gonna get out of slavery

17:44.300 --> 17:45.580
as soon as they could.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.060
But now it becomes a war over freeing them,

17:48.060 --> 17:51.700
over opening that opportunity for them.

17:51.700 --> 17:52.940
And that's how the war ends.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.140
That's really important, right?

17:54.140 --> 17:55.980
And that's where we are in our politics today.

17:55.980 --> 17:56.900
It's the same debate.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.740
It's why I wrote this book.

17:58.740 --> 18:01.500
The challenge of our time is to understand

18:01.500 --> 18:03.700
how do we make our society open

18:03.700 --> 18:06.020
to more freedom for more people.

18:06.020 --> 18:08.900
So let's go to the beginning.

18:08.900 --> 18:12.620
How did the American Civil War start and why?

18:12.620 --> 18:14.380
So the American Civil War starts

18:14.380 --> 18:17.180
because of our flawed institutions.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.220
The founders had mixed views of slavery,

18:20.220 --> 18:23.900
but they wanted a system that would eventually work its way

18:23.900 --> 18:27.420
toward opening for more people of more kinds.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.660
Not necessarily equality,

18:28.660 --> 18:30.940
but they wanted a more open democratic system.

18:30.940 --> 18:33.540
But our institutions were designed in ways

18:33.540 --> 18:37.260
that gave disproportionate power to slave holders

18:37.260 --> 18:39.340
in particular states in the union,

18:39.340 --> 18:41.940
through the Senate, through the electoral college,

18:41.940 --> 18:43.500
through many of the institutions we talk about

18:43.500 --> 18:45.340
in our politics today.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.740
Therefore, that part of the country

18:47.740 --> 18:49.620
was in the words of Abraham Lincoln,

18:49.620 --> 18:52.180
holding the rest of the country hostage.

18:52.180 --> 18:54.780
For a poor white man like Abraham Lincoln,

18:54.780 --> 18:57.380
born in Kentucky, who makes his way in Illinois,

18:57.380 --> 19:00.420
slavery was an evil, not just for moral reasons.

19:00.420 --> 19:04.180
It was an evil because it denied him democratic opportunity.

19:04.180 --> 19:06.940
Why would anyone hire poor Abe to do something

19:06.940 --> 19:09.460
if they could get a slave to do it for free?

19:09.460 --> 19:11.820
And his economy of opportunity for him

19:11.820 --> 19:13.900
had to be an economy that was open

19:13.900 --> 19:15.020
and that did not have slavery,

19:15.020 --> 19:16.220
particularly in the new states

19:16.220 --> 19:18.100
that were coming into the union.

19:18.100 --> 19:21.060
Lincoln was one of the creators of the Republican Party,

19:21.060 --> 19:23.180
which was a party dedicated to making sure

19:23.180 --> 19:27.340
all new territory was open to anyone

19:27.340 --> 19:29.780
who was willing to work, any male figure

19:29.780 --> 19:30.780
who would be paid for their work.

19:30.780 --> 19:34.140
Free labor, free soil, free men, basic capitalism.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.860
Southerners, Southern plantation owners

19:35.860 --> 19:39.420
were an aristocracy that did not want that.

19:39.420 --> 19:40.580
They wanted to use slavery

19:40.580 --> 19:42.860
and expand slavery into the new territories.

19:42.860 --> 19:43.900
What caused the Civil War?

19:43.900 --> 19:48.300
The clash and our institutions that were unable to adapt

19:48.300 --> 19:51.940
and continue to give disproportionate power

19:51.940 --> 19:54.300
to these Southern plantation slave owners.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.940
The Supreme Court was dominated by them.

19:56.940 --> 19:58.900
Senate was dominated by them.

19:58.940 --> 20:01.980
And so the Republican Party came into power

20:01.980 --> 20:03.300
as a critique of that.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.260
And Southerners unwilling to accept,

20:07.260 --> 20:10.500
Southern Confederates unwilling to accept that change

20:10.500 --> 20:12.300
went to war with the union.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.620
So who was on each side?

20:13.620 --> 20:15.500
The union and Confederates.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.660
What are we talking about?

20:16.660 --> 20:17.620
What are the states?

20:17.620 --> 20:18.740
How many people?

20:20.340 --> 20:25.340
What's like the demographics and the dynamics of each side?

20:26.020 --> 20:28.580
The union side is much, much larger,

20:28.780 --> 20:29.740
in terms of population.

20:29.740 --> 20:32.060
I think about 22 million people.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.260
And it is what we would today recognize

20:34.260 --> 20:37.740
as all the states basically North of Virginia.

20:37.740 --> 20:39.380
The South is the states

20:39.380 --> 20:41.660
in the South of the Mason-Dixon line.

20:41.660 --> 20:45.260
So Virginia and there on South, West through Tennessee.

20:45.260 --> 20:47.300
So Texas, for example, is in the Confederacy.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.660
Tennessee is in the Confederacy.

20:49.660 --> 20:53.380
But other states like Missouri are border states.

20:53.380 --> 20:58.300
And the Confederacy is a much smaller entity.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.340
It's made up of about 9 million people

21:00.340 --> 21:02.300
plus about 4 million slaves.

21:02.300 --> 21:06.020
And it is a agricultural economy.

21:06.020 --> 21:07.060
Whereas the Northern economy

21:07.060 --> 21:09.260
is a more industrializing economy.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.180
Interestingly enough, the Confederate states

21:11.180 --> 21:14.180
are in some ways more international

21:14.180 --> 21:15.660
than the Northern states

21:15.660 --> 21:18.260
because they are exporters of cotton,

21:18.260 --> 21:20.060
exporters of tobacco.

21:20.060 --> 21:21.740
So they actually have very strong

21:21.740 --> 21:23.060
international economic ties,

21:23.060 --> 21:24.900
very strong ties to Great Britain.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.820
The United States was the largest source of cotton

21:26.820 --> 21:28.540
to the world before the Civil War.

21:28.540 --> 21:31.660
Egypt replaces that a little bit during the Civil War.

21:31.660 --> 21:33.780
But all the English textiles

21:33.780 --> 21:36.660
were American cotton from the South.

21:36.660 --> 21:39.580
And so it is the Southern half

21:39.580 --> 21:41.180
of what we would call the Eastern part

21:41.180 --> 21:43.580
of the United States today with far fewer people.

21:43.580 --> 21:47.500
It's made up, the Confederacy is, of landed families.

21:47.500 --> 21:51.260
Wealth in the Confederacy was land and slaves.

21:51.260 --> 21:52.740
The Northern United States

21:52.740 --> 21:56.060
is made up predominantly of small business owners

21:56.060 --> 21:58.260
and then larger financial interests,

21:58.260 --> 21:59.700
such as the banks in New York.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.260
And what about the military?

22:03.260 --> 22:05.580
Who are the people that picked up guns?

22:05.580 --> 22:06.540
What are the numbers there?

22:06.540 --> 22:09.420
So the Union also outnumbered the Confederacy.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.500
By far, but it is a really interesting question

22:11.500 --> 22:14.060
because there's no conscription in the Constitution.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.940
Unlike most other countries,

22:15.940 --> 22:18.340
our democracy is formed on the presumption

22:18.340 --> 22:19.860
that human beings should not be forced

22:19.860 --> 22:21.740
to go into the military if they don't want to.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.140
Most democracies in the world today actually still

22:24.140 --> 22:25.420
require military service.

22:25.420 --> 22:27.660
The United States is very rarely in its history.

22:27.660 --> 22:29.620
Done that, it's not in our Constitution.

22:29.620 --> 22:31.980
So during the Civil War,

22:31.980 --> 22:34.340
in the first months and years of the Civil War,

22:34.340 --> 22:38.620
Abraham Lincoln has to go to the different states,

22:38.620 --> 22:41.940
to the governors and ask the governors for volunteers.

22:41.940 --> 22:43.940
So the men who take up arms,

22:43.940 --> 22:46.060
especially in the first months of the war,

22:46.060 --> 22:48.260
are volunteers in the North.

22:48.260 --> 22:51.060
In the South, they're actually conscripted.

22:51.060 --> 22:52.820
And then as the war goes on,

22:52.860 --> 22:57.860
the Union will pass the Conscription Acts of 1862 and 1863,

22:58.100 --> 22:58.940
which for the first time,

22:58.940 --> 22:59.780
and this is really important

22:59.780 --> 23:01.580
because it creates new presidential powers.

23:01.580 --> 23:02.420
For the first time,

23:02.420 --> 23:04.780
Lincoln will have presidential power

23:04.780 --> 23:06.940
to force men into the Army,

23:06.940 --> 23:09.180
which is what leads to all kinds of draft riots

23:09.180 --> 23:11.300
in New York and elsewhere.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.140
But suffice it to say,

23:12.140 --> 23:13.620
the Union Army throughout the war

23:13.620 --> 23:17.420
is often three times the size of the Confederate Army.

23:17.420 --> 23:22.220
What's the relationship between this no conscription

23:22.220 --> 23:25.740
and people standing up to fight for ideas

23:25.740 --> 23:27.340
and the Second Amendment?

23:27.340 --> 23:29.700
A well-regulated militia being necessary

23:29.700 --> 23:31.300
to the security of a free state,

23:31.300 --> 23:33.540
the right of the people to keep and bear arms

23:33.540 --> 23:35.940
shall not be infringed.

23:35.940 --> 23:36.780
We're in Texas.

23:36.780 --> 23:37.900
Yeah, yes.

23:37.900 --> 23:41.460
What's the role of that in this story?

23:41.460 --> 23:45.020
The American population is already armed before the war.

23:45.020 --> 23:47.500
And so even though the Union and the Confederate Armies

23:47.500 --> 23:50.060
will manufacture and purchase arms,

23:50.060 --> 23:51.660
it is already an armed population.

23:51.700 --> 23:55.300
So the American presumption going into the war

23:55.300 --> 23:57.820
is that citizens will not be forced to serve,

23:57.820 --> 23:59.140
but they will serve in militias

23:59.140 --> 24:00.740
to protect their own property.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.700
And so the Second Amendment,

24:01.700 --> 24:03.700
the key part of the Second Amendment for me as a historian

24:03.700 --> 24:05.620
is the well-regulated militia part.

24:05.620 --> 24:09.620
The presumption that citizens as part of their civic duty

24:09.620 --> 24:13.620
do not have a duty to join a national army, Prussian style,

24:13.620 --> 24:15.380
but are supposed to be involved

24:15.380 --> 24:16.860
in defending their communities.

24:17.780 --> 24:19.260
And that's the reality.

24:19.260 --> 24:20.740
It's also a bit of a myth.

24:20.780 --> 24:23.940
And so Americans have, throughout their history,

24:23.940 --> 24:25.540
been gun owners.

24:25.540 --> 24:28.100
Not AK-47 owners, but gun owners.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.300
And gun ownership has been for the purpose

24:30.300 --> 24:32.260
of community self-defense.

24:32.260 --> 24:34.340
The question coming out of that is,

24:34.340 --> 24:36.180
what does that mean in terms of,

24:36.180 --> 24:38.460
do you have access to everything?

24:38.460 --> 24:40.140
Antonin Scalia, even himself,

24:40.140 --> 24:42.060
asked this question on the Supreme Court.

24:42.060 --> 24:45.940
He said, in one of the gun cases,

24:45.940 --> 24:47.620
you have the right to defend yourself,

24:47.620 --> 24:50.460
but you don't have the right to own an Uzi.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.140
You don't have the right to have a tank.

24:52.140 --> 24:53.460
I don't think they'd let you park a tank,

24:53.460 --> 24:55.340
Lex, in your parking spot, right?

24:55.340 --> 24:56.180
I looked into this.

24:56.180 --> 24:59.900
I think there's a gray area around tanks, actually.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.900
I think you're legit allowed to own a tank.

25:03.900 --> 25:04.740
Oh, you really?

25:04.740 --> 25:06.220
I think that, well, somebody looked into this,

25:06.220 --> 25:07.260
because somebody told me,

25:07.260 --> 25:09.180
but I could see that,

25:09.180 --> 25:11.380
because it's very difficult for that to get out of hand.

25:11.380 --> 25:12.300
Right, right.

25:12.300 --> 25:14.380
Okay, maybe one guy in a tank.

25:14.380 --> 25:17.100
You could be breaking laws in terms of the width

25:17.100 --> 25:19.820
of the vehicle that you're using to operate.

25:19.820 --> 25:22.060
Anyway, that's a hilarious discussion.

25:22.060 --> 25:23.780
But, sort of to make the case,

25:23.780 --> 25:25.780
speaking of AK-47s and rifles,

25:25.780 --> 25:27.420
and back to Ukraine for a second,

25:27.420 --> 25:29.900
one of the fascinating social experiments

25:29.900 --> 25:32.980
that happened in Ukraine at the beginning of the war

25:32.980 --> 25:36.940
is they handed out guns to everybody, rifles,

25:36.940 --> 25:39.420
and crime went down,

25:39.420 --> 25:41.700
which I think is really interesting.

25:41.700 --> 25:42.980
Yeah.

25:42.980 --> 25:45.100
I hope somebody does a kind of

25:45.100 --> 25:48.540
psychological data collection analysis effort here

25:48.540 --> 25:50.300
to try to understand why.

25:50.300 --> 25:54.700
Because it's not obvious to me that in a time of war,

25:54.700 --> 25:56.780
if you give guns to the entire populace,

25:56.780 --> 25:58.060
anyone who wants a gun,

25:58.060 --> 25:59.380
it's not going to,

25:59.380 --> 26:00.380
especially in a country

26:00.380 --> 26:02.860
who has historically suffered from corruption,

26:02.860 --> 26:05.780
not result in robberies and assaults

26:05.780 --> 26:06.780
and all that kind of stuff.

26:06.780 --> 26:08.100
There's a deep lesson there.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.780
Now, I don't know if you can extend that lesson

26:09.780 --> 26:11.140
beyond wartime, though.

26:11.140 --> 26:11.980
Right, that's the question.

26:11.980 --> 26:13.100
What happens after the war?

26:13.100 --> 26:15.100
I mean, my inclination would be to say

26:15.100 --> 26:16.140
that can work during war,

26:16.140 --> 26:18.500
but you have to take the guns back after the war.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.740
But they might be very upset when you try to take the guns.

26:21.740 --> 26:22.580
That's the problem.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.140
No, that's precisely the problem.

26:24.140 --> 26:25.540
That's actually part of the story here.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.300
I mean, what happens after the Civil War,

26:27.300 --> 26:29.780
after Appomattox in 1865,

26:29.780 --> 26:34.060
is that many Southern soldiers go home with their guns

26:34.060 --> 26:38.020
and they misuse their weapons to, quite frankly,

26:38.020 --> 26:42.380
shoot and intimidate former slaves who are now citizens.

26:42.380 --> 26:43.220
This is a big problem.

26:43.220 --> 26:45.980
I talk about this in the book in Memphis in 1866.

26:46.820 --> 26:50.340
It is former Confederate soldiers and police officers

26:50.340 --> 26:54.620
and judges who are responsible for hundreds of rapes

26:54.620 --> 26:56.100
within a two-day period

26:56.100 --> 26:59.620
and destroying an entire community of African Americans.

26:59.620 --> 27:00.780
And they're able to do that

27:00.780 --> 27:02.580
because they brought their guns home.

27:02.580 --> 27:06.100
But underneath the issue of guns there

27:06.100 --> 27:10.140
is just the fundamental issue of hatred

27:10.140 --> 27:15.140
and inability to see other humans in this world

27:15.980 --> 27:18.580
of value as another human being.

27:18.580 --> 27:22.020
What was the election of 1860 like

27:22.020 --> 27:24.420
that brought Lincoln to power?

27:24.420 --> 27:28.500
So the election of 1860 was a very divisive election.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.660
We have divisive, contested elections

27:31.660 --> 27:34.660
from 1860, really, until 1896.

27:34.660 --> 27:36.700
The 1860 election is the first election

27:36.700 --> 27:40.380
where a Republican is elected president, that is Lincoln,

27:40.380 --> 27:43.180
but he's elected president with less than 40% of the vote

27:43.220 --> 27:46.420
because you have two sets of Democrats running,

27:46.420 --> 27:49.300
Democrats who are out to defend the Confederacy

27:49.300 --> 27:52.580
and everything, and then Democrats who want to compromise,

27:52.580 --> 27:54.340
but still keep slavery.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.060
Most famous, Stephen Douglas,

27:56.060 --> 27:59.740
who argues for basically allowing each state

27:59.740 --> 28:01.740
to make its own decisions, popular sovereignty,

28:01.740 --> 28:02.780
as he called it.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.860
And then you still have traditional Whigs who are running.

28:04.860 --> 28:07.420
That was the party that preceded the Republican party.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.820
So you have four candidates.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.180
Lincoln wins a plurality.

28:10.180 --> 28:13.340
Lincoln is elected largely because the states

28:13.340 --> 28:17.220
that are anti-slavery or anti-expansion of slavery

28:17.220 --> 28:19.860
are not a majority, but they're a plurality.

28:19.860 --> 28:23.340
And the other states have basically a factionalized.

28:23.340 --> 28:26.580
And so they're unable to have a united front against him.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.700
Was the main topic at hand slavery?

28:29.700 --> 28:31.620
I think the main topic at hand at that time

28:31.620 --> 28:35.540
was the expansion of slavery into new territories.

28:35.540 --> 28:36.380
Into new territories.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.180
It was not, whether to abolish slavery or not,

28:38.300 --> 28:39.140
but Lincoln is very careful

28:39.140 --> 28:41.300
and his correspondence is clear.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.700
He wants no one on his side during the election

28:43.700 --> 28:46.100
to say that he's arguing for abolitionism,

28:46.100 --> 28:48.340
even though he personally supported that.

28:48.340 --> 28:50.940
What he wants to say is the Republican party

28:50.940 --> 28:54.220
is for no new slave territories.

28:54.220 --> 28:58.540
Did he make it clear that he was for abolition?

28:58.540 --> 29:01.340
No, he was intentionally unclear about that.

29:03.340 --> 29:06.340
Do you think he was throughout his life?

29:06.380 --> 29:10.020
Was there a deep, because that takes quite a vision.

29:10.020 --> 29:11.500
Like you look at society today

29:12.340 --> 29:17.340
and it takes quite a man to see

29:17.740 --> 29:19.420
that there's something deeply broken

29:19.420 --> 29:21.140
where a lot of people take for granted.

29:21.140 --> 29:24.420
I mean, into modern day, you could see factory farming

29:24.420 --> 29:26.300
as one of those things that in a hundred years

29:26.300 --> 29:28.340
we might see as like the torture,

29:28.340 --> 29:32.060
the mass torture of animals could be seen as evil.

29:32.060 --> 29:34.420
But just to look around and wake up to that,

29:34.420 --> 29:36.540
especially in a leadership position.

29:36.540 --> 29:38.260
Yeah, was he able to see that?

29:38.260 --> 29:39.100
In some ways, yes.

29:39.100 --> 29:39.920
In some ways, no.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.060
I mean, the premise of your question is really important

29:42.060 --> 29:46.780
that to us, it's obvious that slavery is a horror.

29:46.780 --> 29:48.220
But to those who had grown up with it,

29:48.220 --> 29:50.260
who had grown up seeing that,

29:50.260 --> 29:52.180
it was hard to imagine a different world.

29:52.180 --> 29:53.740
So you're right.

29:53.740 --> 29:55.900
Lincoln's imagination like everyone else's

29:55.900 --> 29:57.820
was limited by his time.

29:57.820 --> 29:59.700
I don't think Lincoln imagined a world

29:59.700 --> 30:01.660
of equality between the races,

30:01.660 --> 30:05.500
but he had come to see that slavery was horrible.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.600
And historians have differed in how he came to this.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.580
Part of it is that he had a father

30:12.580 --> 30:14.700
who treated him like a slave.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.580
And you can see in his early correspondence

30:16.580 --> 30:18.140
how much he hates that his father,

30:18.140 --> 30:19.900
who was a struggling farmer,

30:19.900 --> 30:22.700
was basically trying to control Lincoln's life.

30:22.700 --> 30:25.620
And he came to understand personally,

30:25.620 --> 30:27.460
I think how horrible it is to have someone else

30:27.460 --> 30:29.720
tell you what you should do with your labor,

30:29.720 --> 30:32.800
not giving you your own choices.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.360
But Lincoln was also a pragmatist.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.160
This is what made him a great politician.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.960
He wanted to work through institutions,

30:37.960 --> 30:39.720
not to burn them down.

30:39.720 --> 30:44.720
And he famously said that if he could preserve the union

30:45.320 --> 30:47.140
and stop the spread of slavery

30:47.140 --> 30:49.360
by allowing slavery to stay in the South, he would.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.440
If he could do it by eliminating slavery in the South,

30:51.440 --> 30:53.080
if he could do it by buying the slaves

30:53.080 --> 30:55.200
and sending them somewhere else, he would.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.920
His main goal, what he ran on,

30:57.920 --> 31:00.580
was that the new territories west of Illinois,

31:00.580 --> 31:02.460
that they would be areas for free,

31:02.460 --> 31:05.540
poor white men like him, not slavery.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.800
What do you learn about human nature

31:09.800 --> 31:11.960
if we step back and look at the big picture of it,

31:11.960 --> 31:14.560
that slavery has been a part of human civilization

31:14.560 --> 31:15.920
for thousands of years,

31:15.920 --> 31:20.580
that this American slavery is not a new phenomenon?

31:21.700 --> 31:23.800
I think history teaches us a very pessimistic

31:23.800 --> 31:25.280
and a very optimistic lesson.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.560
The pessimistic lesson is that human beings

31:27.560 --> 31:31.640
are capable of doing enormous harm and brutality

31:31.640 --> 31:33.680
to their fellow man and woman.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.520
And we see that with genocide in our world today,

31:36.520 --> 31:40.400
that human beings are capable with the right stimuli,

31:40.400 --> 31:45.160
the right incentives of enslaving others.

31:45.160 --> 31:48.200
I mean, genocide is in the same category, right?

31:49.720 --> 31:54.080
The optimistic side is that human beings are also capable

31:54.080 --> 31:56.460
with proper leadership and governance

31:56.460 --> 31:58.720
of resisting those urges,

31:58.720 --> 32:01.780
of putting those energies into productive uses

32:01.780 --> 32:02.820
for other people.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.420
But I don't think that comes naturally.

32:05.420 --> 32:08.260
I think that's where leadership and institutions matter.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.340
But leadership and institutions can tame us.

32:10.340 --> 32:13.620
We can tame, we can civilize ourselves.

32:13.620 --> 32:16.220
For a long time, we stopped using that verb to civilize.

32:16.220 --> 32:17.940
I believe in civilization.

32:17.940 --> 32:19.980
I believe there's a civilizing role.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.380
Lincoln spoke of that, right?

32:21.380 --> 32:22.380
So did Franklin Roosevelt,

32:22.380 --> 32:24.720
the civilizing role that government plays.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.400
Education is only a part of that.

32:27.300 --> 32:29.680
It's creating laws, minimal laws, but laws nonetheless,

32:29.680 --> 32:34.360
that incentivize and penalize us for going to the dark side.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.600
But if we allow that to happen,

32:35.600 --> 32:38.160
or we have leaders who encourage us to go to the dark side,

32:38.160 --> 32:42.440
we can very quickly go down a deep, dark tunnel.

32:42.440 --> 32:46.440
See, I believe that most people want to do good.

32:46.440 --> 32:49.520
And the power of institutions, if done well,

32:50.720 --> 32:54.440
they encourage and protect you if you want to do good.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.480
So if you're just in the jungle,

32:58.400 --> 33:00.360
from a game theoretic perspective,

33:00.360 --> 33:02.800
you get punished for doing good.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.280
So being extremely self-centered and greedy,

33:06.280 --> 33:08.480
and even violent and manipulative

33:08.480 --> 33:11.660
can have, from a game theory perspective, benefits.

33:11.660 --> 33:14.200
But I don't think that's what most humans want.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.620
Institutions allow you to do what you actually want,

33:16.620 --> 33:19.600
which is to do good for the world, do good for others,

33:19.600 --> 33:23.280
and actually, in so doing, do good for yourself.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.840
Institutions protect that natural human instinct, I think.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.320
And what you just articulated,

33:28.320 --> 33:31.100
which I think the historical record is very strong on,

33:31.100 --> 33:33.240
is the classic liberal position.

33:33.240 --> 33:36.620
That's what liberalism means in a 19th century sense, right?

33:36.620 --> 33:39.280
That you believe in civilizing human beings

33:39.280 --> 33:40.400
through institutions.

33:40.400 --> 33:44.400
That begins with education, kindergarten is an institution,

33:44.400 --> 33:49.400
laws, and just basic habits that are enforced by society.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.440
How do you think people thought about the idea,

33:53.480 --> 33:56.400
how did they square the idea of all men are created equal,

33:56.400 --> 34:00.400
those very powerful words at the founding of this nation?

34:01.400 --> 34:03.240
How did they square that with slavery?

34:04.240 --> 34:07.080
For many Americans, saying all men were created equal

34:07.080 --> 34:10.240
required slavery, because it meant that

34:10.240 --> 34:12.880
the equality of white people was dependent upon

34:12.880 --> 34:14.480
others doing the work for us.

34:14.480 --> 34:17.040
In the way some people view it,

34:17.520 --> 34:21.520
in the way some people view animal labor today.

34:21.520 --> 34:25.600
And maybe in 50 years, we'll see that as a contradiction.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.320
But the notion among many Americans

34:28.320 --> 34:29.840
in the 17th, 18th century,

34:29.840 --> 34:31.740
and this would also be true for those in other societies,

34:31.740 --> 34:36.660
was that equality for white men meant

34:36.660 --> 34:39.480
that you had access to the labor of others

34:39.480 --> 34:42.560
that would allow you to equalize other differences.

34:42.560 --> 34:46.480
So you could produce enough food

34:46.480 --> 34:49.360
so your family could live equally well-nourished

34:49.360 --> 34:52.720
as other families because you had slaves on the land

34:52.720 --> 34:53.720
doing the farming for you.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.760
This is Thomas Jefferson's world.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.000
So it's like animal farm, all animals are equal

34:59.000 --> 35:00.560
but some are more equal than others.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.400
That's right.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.840
And I think that's still the way people view things.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.680
Yeah.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.520
Right?

35:05.520 --> 35:07.800
I don't know if that's a liberal position

35:07.800 --> 35:09.000
or it's just a human position

35:09.000 --> 35:13.700
that all humans have equal value,

35:13.700 --> 35:17.420
just on the basic level of humanity.

35:17.420 --> 35:19.180
But do we really believe that?

35:19.180 --> 35:22.180
We want to, I don't know if our society

35:22.180 --> 35:23.700
really believes that yet.

35:23.700 --> 35:24.980
And I don't know exactly.

35:24.980 --> 35:27.900
I mean, it's super complicated, of course.

35:27.900 --> 35:30.140
When you realize the amount of suffering

35:30.140 --> 35:31.680
that's going on in the world

35:31.680 --> 35:34.860
where there's children dying from starvation in Africa

35:34.860 --> 35:36.940
and to say that all humans are equal,

35:36.940 --> 35:39.580
well, a few dollars can save their life.

35:39.580 --> 35:42.780
And instead we buy a Starbucks coffee

35:42.780 --> 35:46.500
and are willing to pay 10, 50, $100,000

35:46.500 --> 35:50.100
to save a child, our child, like somebody from our family

35:50.100 --> 35:54.060
and don't want to spend $2 to save a child over in Africa.

35:54.060 --> 35:54.900
Right.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.380
So there's, and I think Sam Harris or others

35:57.380 --> 35:59.660
have talked about like, well, I don't want to live

35:59.660 --> 36:04.660
in a world where we'd rather send $2 to Africa.

36:04.980 --> 36:07.420
There's something deeply human about saving those

36:07.420 --> 36:09.620
that are really close to you, the ones we love.

36:09.620 --> 36:13.980
So that like hypocrisy that seems to go attention

36:13.980 --> 36:17.460
with the basic ethics of alleviating suffering in the world,

36:17.460 --> 36:19.140
that's also really human.

36:19.140 --> 36:23.780
That's also part of this ideal of all men are created equal.

36:23.780 --> 36:26.020
It's a complicated, messy world, ethically.

36:26.020 --> 36:28.900
It is, but I mean, I think at least the way I think

36:28.900 --> 36:31.900
about it is, so what are the things even

36:31.900 --> 36:36.180
within our own society where we choose to do something

36:36.180 --> 36:38.860
with our resources that actually doesn't help

36:38.860 --> 36:40.340
the lives of many people?

36:40.340 --> 36:43.700
So we invest in all kinds of things that are often

36:43.700 --> 36:45.460
because someone is lobbying for them.

36:45.460 --> 36:46.860
This happens on both sides of the aisle.

36:46.860 --> 36:48.980
This is not a political statement, right?

36:48.980 --> 36:52.220
Rather than saying, you know, if we invested a little more

36:52.220 --> 36:54.100
of our money, really a little more, we can make sure

36:54.100 --> 36:57.220
every child in this country had decent healthcare.

36:57.220 --> 36:59.340
We can make sure every child in this country

36:59.340 --> 37:02.140
had what they needed to start life healthy.

37:03.300 --> 37:05.460
And that would not require us to sacrifice a lot,

37:05.460 --> 37:08.260
but it would require us to sacrifice a few things.

37:09.140 --> 37:10.620
Yeah, so there's a balance there.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.740
And I also noticed the passive-aggressive statement

37:13.740 --> 37:16.140
you're making about how I'm spending my money.

37:16.140 --> 37:17.660
Hey, well, me too.

37:17.660 --> 37:19.380
Spending it a little more wisely.

37:21.100 --> 37:24.100
You know, I like to eat nice meals at nice restaurants,

37:24.100 --> 37:26.060
so I'm as guilty of this as you are.

37:27.380 --> 37:29.980
I got a couch, and that couch serves no purpose.

37:29.980 --> 37:30.820
It looks nice, though.

37:30.820 --> 37:31.660
No, it's a nice looking couch.

37:31.660 --> 37:33.020
Thank you, I appreciate that.

37:33.020 --> 37:33.940
It's actually very clean.

37:33.940 --> 37:35.780
I got it for occasional Instagram photos

37:35.780 --> 37:37.100
to look like an adult.

37:37.100 --> 37:40.940
Okay, because everything else in my life is a giant mess.

37:42.900 --> 37:46.060
What role did the ideas that the founding documents

37:46.060 --> 37:48.580
of this country play in this war,

37:48.580 --> 37:51.980
the war between the Union and the Confederate states,

37:51.980 --> 37:54.500
and the founding ideas that were supposed to be

37:54.500 --> 37:55.620
unifying to this country?

37:55.620 --> 37:57.660
Is there interesting tensions there?

37:57.660 --> 37:59.460
Well, there were certainly tensions because

37:59.460 --> 38:01.540
built into the founding documents, of course,

38:01.540 --> 38:04.740
is slavery, and inequality, and women's exclusion

38:04.740 --> 38:07.140
from voting and things of that sort.

38:07.140 --> 38:10.020
But the real brilliance of Abraham Lincoln

38:10.020 --> 38:12.620
is to build on the brilliance of the founders

38:12.620 --> 38:15.860
and turn the Union position into the defense

38:15.860 --> 38:18.420
of the core ideas of the country.

38:18.420 --> 38:21.300
So the Confederacy is defending one idea,

38:21.300 --> 38:22.300
the idea of slavery.

38:23.380 --> 38:26.820
Lincoln takes the basket of all the deeper ideas

38:26.820 --> 38:28.060
and puts them together.

38:28.060 --> 38:30.020
Three things the war is about for Lincoln,

38:30.020 --> 38:32.700
and this is why his speeches still resonate with us today.

38:32.700 --> 38:33.820
Every time I'm in Washington,

38:33.820 --> 38:35.700
I go to the Lincoln Memorial.

38:35.700 --> 38:37.820
It's the best memorial, best monument,

38:37.820 --> 38:39.540
I think, in the world, actually.

38:39.540 --> 38:43.220
And there are always people there,

38:43.220 --> 38:47.620
reading Gettysburg Address and the second inaugural.

38:47.620 --> 38:48.980
Lincoln had two years of education,

38:48.980 --> 38:50.580
yet he found the words to describe

38:50.580 --> 38:52.140
what our country was about better than anyone,

38:52.140 --> 38:54.740
and it's because he went back to these founding values,

38:54.740 --> 38:57.180
three values, we already talked about one, freedom.

38:59.060 --> 39:01.780
And freedom is actually complex, but it's also simple.

39:02.780 --> 39:05.580
The simple Lincoln definition is that freedom

39:05.580 --> 39:10.140
is the right of each person to work for himself or herself,

39:10.140 --> 39:12.020
which is to say, it doesn't mean you own your own company,

39:12.020 --> 39:14.340
it means you control your labor.

39:14.340 --> 39:17.820
And no one can tell you you have to work for a certain wage.

39:17.820 --> 39:20.940
You might not have a job, but you decide, you decide, right?

39:20.940 --> 39:23.100
You can see where that comes from his own background

39:23.100 --> 39:24.100
as a poor man, right?

39:24.100 --> 39:27.020
So freedom is the control of your own labor.

39:27.020 --> 39:29.740
Second, democracy, government of the people,

39:29.740 --> 39:31.300
by the people, for the people.

39:31.300 --> 39:32.540
The government is to serve the people,

39:32.540 --> 39:34.620
it's to come from the people.

39:34.620 --> 39:36.900
And then the third point, justice

39:36.900 --> 39:38.700
and helping all human beings.

39:39.580 --> 39:42.540
He, at the end of his life, as the Civil War is ending,

39:42.540 --> 39:46.340
he never declares that the South should be punished.

39:46.340 --> 39:49.020
His argument is that we shouldn't apologize

39:49.020 --> 39:50.540
for their misdeeds,

39:50.540 --> 39:52.460
but that all should be part of this future.

39:52.460 --> 39:53.780
He's not arguing for consensus,

39:53.780 --> 39:55.660
he's arguing for a society

39:55.660 --> 39:58.500
where everyone has a stake going forward.

39:58.500 --> 40:01.020
So justice, democracy, freedom.

40:01.820 --> 40:03.580
Those are the gifts.

40:03.580 --> 40:05.300
I talked about the flaws in our system.

40:05.300 --> 40:07.420
Those are the virtues in our system

40:07.420 --> 40:10.700
that our founders coming out of the enlightenment planted

40:10.700 --> 40:12.220
and Lincoln carries them forward.

40:12.220 --> 40:15.340
He gives us the 2.0 version of them.

40:15.340 --> 40:18.740
So a few tangent questions about each of those.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.100
So one on democracy,

40:21.780 --> 40:24.300
people often bring up the United States is not a democracy,

40:24.300 --> 40:27.700
it's a republic that is representative.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.220
Is there some interesting tensions there in terminology

40:30.220 --> 40:34.060
or is, yeah, can you maybe kind of expand

40:34.060 --> 40:36.380
on the different versions of democracy?

40:37.300 --> 40:38.660
So the philosophy of democracy,

40:38.660 --> 40:40.900
but also the practical implementations of it.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.780
Sure, the founders intended for us to be a democracy.

40:43.780 --> 40:45.700
This argument that they want us to be a republic

40:45.700 --> 40:49.180
instead of a democracy is one of these made up myths.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.980
They believed that fundamentally what they were creating

40:52.980 --> 40:56.300
was a society, very few of which had existed before,

40:56.300 --> 40:58.900
a society where the government would be of the people,

40:58.900 --> 41:00.060
by the people, for the people.

41:00.060 --> 41:01.420
That's what they expected, right?

41:01.420 --> 41:02.260
That's what it meant.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.860
So the legitimacy of our government was not gonna be

41:04.860 --> 41:07.940
that the person in charge was of royal blood.

41:07.940 --> 41:09.340
That's the way the Europeans did it.

41:09.340 --> 41:12.740
Or that the person in charge had killed enough people,

41:12.740 --> 41:16.420
a la Genghis Khan, or that the person in charge

41:16.420 --> 41:18.140
was serving a particular class.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.460
It was that the person in charge,

41:19.460 --> 41:22.460
the institutions were to serve the people.

41:22.460 --> 41:25.220
They adopted Republican tools to get there

41:26.420 --> 41:29.620
because they were fearful appropriately

41:29.660 --> 41:33.580
of simply throwing every issue up to the masses.

41:33.580 --> 41:35.780
Democracy is not mob rule.

41:35.780 --> 41:38.740
Democracy is where you create procedures

41:38.740 --> 41:42.740
to assess the public will and to act in ways

41:42.740 --> 41:46.060
that serve the public without harming other elements

41:46.060 --> 41:48.060
of the public that are not in the majority.

41:48.060 --> 41:50.740
That's why we have a constitution and a bill of rights.

41:50.740 --> 41:53.100
And for their time, the founders did not believe

41:53.100 --> 41:55.180
that women should be part of this discussion,

41:55.180 --> 41:56.660
that they were not capable.

41:56.660 --> 41:57.860
They were wrong about that.

41:57.860 --> 41:59.220
In their time, that's how they thought.

41:59.220 --> 42:00.860
We've, of course, changed that.

42:00.860 --> 42:04.100
They believed you had to have property to have a stake.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.500
We don't believe that anymore.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.420
So we can argue over the details.

42:07.420 --> 42:10.500
And those 50 years from now will criticize us

42:10.500 --> 42:12.420
for the way we think about these things.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.380
But it was fundamentally about,

42:14.380 --> 42:17.940
this is the radicalism of the American experiment,

42:17.940 --> 42:21.060
that government should serve the people, all people.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.100
So democracy means of the people,

42:23.100 --> 42:24.620
by the people, for the people.

42:24.620 --> 42:28.420
And then it doesn't actually give any details

42:28.420 --> 42:29.380
of how you implement that,

42:29.380 --> 42:31.380
because you could implement all kinds of ways.

42:31.380 --> 42:32.820
And I think what we've learned as historians,

42:32.820 --> 42:33.740
and I think what the founders knew,

42:33.740 --> 42:35.060
because they were very well read

42:35.060 --> 42:36.700
in the history of Rome and Greece,

42:36.700 --> 42:39.380
was that democracy will always have unique characteristics

42:39.380 --> 42:40.780
for the culture that it's in.

42:42.540 --> 42:44.220
If coming out of the war against Russia,

42:44.220 --> 42:46.580
Ukraine is able to build a better democracy

42:46.580 --> 42:47.580
than it had before,

42:47.580 --> 42:50.340
it's never gonna look like the United States.

42:50.340 --> 42:52.340
It's, I'm not saying it's gonna be worse or better.

42:52.340 --> 42:53.660
A culture matters.

42:53.660 --> 42:57.140
The particular history of societies matters.

42:57.180 --> 42:59.500
Japan is a vibrant democracy.

42:59.500 --> 43:01.020
I've been there many times.

43:01.020 --> 43:04.540
It does not look at all like the American democracy.

43:04.540 --> 43:07.820
So democracy is a set of values.

43:07.820 --> 43:09.620
The implementation of those values

43:09.620 --> 43:12.740
is a set of practical institutional decisions one makes

43:12.740 --> 43:15.260
based in one's cultural position.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.100
So just the one on that topic, is there,

43:17.100 --> 43:20.220
if you do representative, you said like,

43:20.220 --> 43:25.220
democracy should not, one failure mode is mob rule.

43:25.900 --> 43:27.500
So it should not descend into that.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.180
Not every issue should be up to everybody.

43:29.180 --> 43:30.020
Correct.

43:30.020 --> 43:31.540
Okay, so you have representation,

43:31.540 --> 43:36.540
but Stalin similarly felt that he could represent

43:38.700 --> 43:40.380
the interests of the public.

43:40.380 --> 43:43.820
He was also helping represent the interests of the public.

43:43.820 --> 43:45.940
So that's a failure mode too.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.340
If the people representing the public

43:48.340 --> 43:50.140
become more and more powerful,

43:50.140 --> 43:51.900
they start becoming detached

43:51.900 --> 43:55.020
from actually being able to represent

43:55.860 --> 43:57.780
or having just a basic human sense of what the public wants.

43:57.780 --> 44:01.220
I think being of the people by the people for the people

44:01.220 --> 44:04.180
means you are in some way accountable to the people.

44:04.180 --> 44:07.060
And the problem with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union,

44:07.060 --> 44:10.260
this was already evident before Stalin came into power,

44:10.260 --> 44:13.340
is the same problem the Communist Party of China has today,

44:13.340 --> 44:16.260
which is that you have leadership that's non-accountable.

44:18.020 --> 44:21.340
Well, let me go then to one of the other three principles

44:21.340 --> 44:22.740
of freedom, because one of the ways

44:22.740 --> 44:24.340
to keep government accountable

44:24.340 --> 44:26.300
is the freedom of the press.

44:26.300 --> 44:28.500
So there's the internet and on the internet

44:28.500 --> 44:31.460
there's social networks and one of them is called Twitter.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.580
I think you have an account there,

44:32.580 --> 44:33.980
people should follow you.

44:33.980 --> 44:37.860
And recently people have been throwing around recently

44:37.860 --> 44:40.340
for a while the words of freedom of speech.

44:41.540 --> 44:45.380
Just out of curiosity, for a tangent upon a tangent,

44:45.380 --> 44:48.900
what do you think of freedom of speech as it is today

44:48.900 --> 44:51.420
and as it was at that time during the Civil War,

44:51.420 --> 44:54.380
after the Civil War and throughout the history of America?

44:54.380 --> 44:57.660
So freedom of speech has always been one of the core tenants

44:57.660 --> 45:01.740
of American democracy and I'm near absolutist on it

45:01.740 --> 45:05.660
because I think that people should have the right to speak.

45:05.660 --> 45:08.980
What makes our democracy function

45:08.980 --> 45:11.500
is that there is always room for,

45:11.500 --> 45:13.740
quite frankly, people like you and me

45:13.740 --> 45:18.220
who like to disagree and have reasons to disagree.

45:18.220 --> 45:21.140
So I am against almost all forms of censorship.

45:21.140 --> 45:23.540
The only time I believe in censorship

45:23.540 --> 45:26.660
is if somehow an individual or a newspaper

45:26.660 --> 45:29.460
has stolen the Ukrainian plans

45:29.460 --> 45:32.100
for their next military movements in the next week.

45:32.100 --> 45:34.820
You should not be able to publish that right now,

45:34.820 --> 45:38.060
maybe after they act, but criticism, opinion,

45:38.060 --> 45:41.100
interpretation should be wide open.

45:41.100 --> 45:46.100
Now that doesn't mean though that you have the right

45:46.420 --> 45:49.740
to come to my classroom and start shouting

45:49.740 --> 45:51.420
and saying whatever you want.

45:51.420 --> 45:54.140
You have the right on the street corner to do that,

45:54.140 --> 45:57.060
but my classroom is a classroom for my students

45:57.060 --> 45:58.300
with a particular purpose.

45:58.300 --> 45:59.940
Sorry about that from last week,

45:59.940 --> 46:04.140
I'll never do it again, I apologize, I'm really sorry.

46:04.140 --> 46:05.660
It's okay, it's all right.

46:05.660 --> 46:07.220
I get drunk and I get,

46:07.220 --> 46:08.060
so the people who don't know,

46:08.060 --> 46:10.700
you're a professor at UT Austin, it's nearby,

46:10.700 --> 46:13.420
so sometimes I get a little drunk and wander in there,

46:13.420 --> 46:14.540
I apologize. You're not the only one.

46:14.540 --> 46:15.860
Was that you? I didn't even know it was you.

46:15.860 --> 46:16.700
I'm sorry.

46:17.580 --> 46:18.420
Okay.

46:18.420 --> 46:21.940
So the point is that free speech is not licensed

46:21.940 --> 46:24.300
to invade someone else's space,

46:24.300 --> 46:26.260
and I also believe in private enterprise,

46:26.260 --> 46:31.260
so I think that if I owned a social media network,

46:31.740 --> 46:36.140
I don't, it would be up to me to decide

46:36.140 --> 46:38.540
who gets to speak on that network and who doesn't,

46:38.540 --> 46:41.060
and then people could decide not to use it

46:41.060 --> 46:42.300
if they don't wanna use it.

46:42.300 --> 46:45.140
But there's, so yes, that's one of the founding principles,

46:45.140 --> 46:47.380
so oftentimes when you talk about censorship,

46:47.380 --> 46:49.580
that's government censorship.

46:49.580 --> 46:52.860
So social media, if you run a social media company,

46:52.860 --> 46:55.580
you should be able to decide from a technical perspective

46:55.580 --> 46:57.060
of what freedom of speech means.

46:57.060 --> 47:01.340
But there's some deeper ethical, philosophical sense of

47:02.460 --> 47:06.300
how do you create a world where every voice is heard

47:06.300 --> 47:08.020
of the people, by the people, for the people?

47:08.020 --> 47:11.940
That's not a, that's a complicated technical problem.

47:11.940 --> 47:13.620
When you have a public square,

47:13.620 --> 47:15.500
how do you have a productive conversation

47:15.500 --> 47:16.900
where critics aren't silenced,

47:16.900 --> 47:19.740
but at the same time, whoever has the bigger megaphone

47:19.740 --> 47:22.100
is not gonna crowd out everybody else?

47:22.100 --> 47:26.540
So I think it's very important to create rules of the game

47:26.540 --> 47:29.060
that give everyone a chance to get started

47:29.060 --> 47:33.580
and that allow for guideposts to be created

47:33.580 --> 47:35.380
from the will of the community,

47:35.380 --> 47:39.500
which is to say that we as a community can say,

47:39.500 --> 47:41.580
we can't stop people from speaking,

47:41.580 --> 47:44.260
but we as a community can say that in certain forms,

47:44.260 --> 47:47.260
we're gonna create certain rules for who gets to speak

47:47.260 --> 47:49.140
and who doesn't, under what terms,

47:49.140 --> 47:50.780
but they can still have somewhere else to go.

47:50.780 --> 47:53.980
So I believe in opening space for everyone,

47:53.980 --> 47:57.580
but creating certain spaces within those spaces

47:57.580 --> 47:59.460
that are designed for certain purposes.

47:59.460 --> 48:01.060
That's what a school does.

48:01.060 --> 48:04.860
So I will not bring someone to speak to my students

48:04.860 --> 48:06.780
who is unqualified.

48:06.780 --> 48:08.260
It's not a political judgment.

48:08.260 --> 48:09.820
The rules at a university

48:09.820 --> 48:11.260
or we're an educational institution,

48:11.260 --> 48:13.020
you need to have the educational credentials

48:13.020 --> 48:14.860
to come speak about artificial intelligence.

48:14.860 --> 48:18.900
I'm not gonna bring some bum off the street to do that.

48:18.900 --> 48:19.740
We have certain rules,

48:19.740 --> 48:21.340
but that bum on the street can still,

48:21.340 --> 48:23.140
in his own space or her own space,

48:23.140 --> 48:24.620
can still say what he or she wants to say

48:24.620 --> 48:26.100
about artificial intelligence.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.620
This is how newspapers work.

48:27.620 --> 48:29.060
When I write for the New York Times,

48:29.060 --> 48:31.540
they have an editorial team.

48:31.540 --> 48:33.980
The editorial team makes certain decisions.

48:33.980 --> 48:37.100
They check facts and there are certain points of view.

48:37.100 --> 48:39.100
They don't allow antisemitic comments.

48:40.340 --> 48:43.220
You're not gonna be able to publish an antisemitic screed,

48:43.220 --> 48:46.340
whether you think it's true or not true in the New York Times,

48:46.340 --> 48:49.100
but that doesn't prevent you from finding somewhere else.

48:49.100 --> 48:52.220
So we allow entities to create certain rules of the game.

48:52.220 --> 48:55.380
We make transparent what those rules are,

48:55.380 --> 48:56.660
and then we as citizens know

48:56.660 --> 48:58.020
where to go to get our information.

48:58.020 --> 49:00.620
What's been a problem the last few decades, I think,

49:00.620 --> 49:02.180
is it hasn't been clear

49:02.180 --> 49:03.820
what the rules are in different places

49:03.820 --> 49:06.220
and what are the legitimate places to get information

49:06.220 --> 49:07.060
and what are not.

49:07.060 --> 49:09.180
Yeah, the transparency seems to be very critical there.

49:09.220 --> 49:10.740
Even for the New York Times,

49:10.740 --> 49:12.820
I think there's a lot of skepticism

49:12.820 --> 49:16.660
about which way the editorial processes lean.

49:16.660 --> 49:18.940
I mean, there's a public perception that it's,

49:18.940 --> 49:20.380
especially for opinions,

49:20.380 --> 49:23.540
it's going to be very left-leaning in the New York Times.

49:23.540 --> 49:27.580
And without transparency about what the process is like,

49:27.580 --> 49:29.340
about the people involved,

49:29.340 --> 49:31.380
all you do, like, conspiracy theories

49:31.380 --> 49:33.900
and the general public opinion about that

49:33.900 --> 49:36.380
is going to go wild.

49:36.380 --> 49:39.100
And I think that's okay for the New York Times.

49:39.940 --> 49:42.420
People can, in a collective way, figure stuff out.

49:42.420 --> 49:44.420
Like, they can say, okay, New York Times,

49:45.620 --> 49:48.780
73% of the time is going to lean left in their head.

49:48.780 --> 49:51.620
They have, like, a loose estimation or whatever.

49:51.620 --> 49:53.740
But for a platform like Twitter,

49:53.740 --> 49:57.020
it seems like it's more complicated.

49:57.020 --> 49:58.460
Of course, there should be rules of the game,

49:58.460 --> 50:02.860
but I think there's, maybe I want to say a responsibility

50:02.860 --> 50:05.100
to also create incentives

50:05.100 --> 50:10.100
for people to do high effort empathetic debate

50:10.260 --> 50:12.740
versus throwing poop at each other.

50:12.740 --> 50:15.140
Yeah, I think those are two slightly different things,

50:15.140 --> 50:16.140
though I agree.

50:16.140 --> 50:19.900
I think that my view is that the failure of Facebook

50:19.900 --> 50:22.500
and Twitter and others in recent years

50:22.500 --> 50:25.140
has been that they have been completely untransparent

50:25.140 --> 50:26.380
about their rules.

50:26.380 --> 50:30.020
So what I would think would advance us

50:30.020 --> 50:32.580
is if they had a set of rules that were clear,

50:32.580 --> 50:34.660
that were consistently followed,

50:35.220 --> 50:36.820
and we understood what they were,

50:36.820 --> 50:39.500
that would also tell us as consumers

50:39.500 --> 50:41.900
how much, what the biases are,

50:41.900 --> 50:43.260
how to understand what's going on.

50:43.260 --> 50:44.380
It seems, if I might say,

50:44.380 --> 50:46.100
that since Elon Musk has taken over Twitter,

50:46.100 --> 50:47.860
it's been arbitrary in who's thrown off

50:47.860 --> 50:49.460
and who's not thrown off.

50:49.460 --> 50:50.820
And that's a real problem.

50:50.820 --> 50:54.220
Arbitrariness is in some ways the opposite of democracy.

50:54.220 --> 50:57.860
But there's also a hidden arbitrariness

50:57.860 --> 51:00.860
in interpretation of the rules.

51:00.900 --> 51:04.860
So for example, what comment incites violence?

51:05.740 --> 51:07.900
That's really, really difficult to figure out to me.

51:07.900 --> 51:09.260
There's a gray area.

51:09.260 --> 51:11.900
Obviously, there's very clear versions of that.

51:11.900 --> 51:14.060
But if I know anything about people

51:14.060 --> 51:15.860
that try to incite violence,

51:15.860 --> 51:18.740
they're usually not coming out and clearly saying it.

51:18.740 --> 51:21.340
They're usually kind of dog whistling it.

51:21.340 --> 51:23.700
And same with racism and anti-Semitism, all of that.

51:23.700 --> 51:25.220
It's usually dog whistles.

51:25.220 --> 51:29.300
So like, and they usually have fun playing with the rules,

51:29.300 --> 51:30.380
playing around the rules.

51:31.020 --> 51:31.860
It's a gray area.

51:31.860 --> 51:34.340
Same with June COVID, misinformation.

51:34.340 --> 51:36.020
What's misinformation, right?

51:36.020 --> 51:36.860
I agree.

51:36.860 --> 51:38.860
And some of these are age-old problems.

51:38.860 --> 51:40.380
Our legal system, common law,

51:40.380 --> 51:43.020
has been struggling with what is incitement to violence

51:43.020 --> 51:45.100
since the first Supreme Court decisions

51:45.100 --> 51:46.420
in the 18th century, right?

51:46.420 --> 51:49.180
So you're absolutely right.

51:49.180 --> 51:50.460
But I will say this.

51:50.460 --> 51:51.340
There are certain things

51:51.340 --> 51:53.260
that are clearly incitement to violence.

51:53.260 --> 51:54.940
I'll give you very clear examples.

51:56.140 --> 51:57.260
I'll just make it personal, right?

51:57.260 --> 51:59.620
My wife is an elected official here in Austin.

51:59.660 --> 52:01.860
There have been people who have put things up on Twitter

52:01.860 --> 52:03.540
calling for her to be hanged

52:03.540 --> 52:05.460
or calling for her to be attacked.

52:05.460 --> 52:06.940
That's incitement to violence.

52:06.940 --> 52:10.300
When you specifically call for violence against someone.

52:10.300 --> 52:11.460
I agree, there's a lot of other stuff

52:11.460 --> 52:12.540
where it's a gray area,

52:12.540 --> 52:17.220
but we could start if we're applying these rules

52:17.220 --> 52:19.420
by getting that material off of these sites.

52:19.420 --> 52:22.060
So some of that is a problem of scale too,

52:22.060 --> 52:25.300
but the gray area is still a forever problem

52:25.300 --> 52:26.980
that we may never be able to solve

52:27.020 --> 52:29.940
and maybe the tension within the gray area

52:29.940 --> 52:32.100
is the very process of democracy.

52:32.100 --> 52:35.140
But saying like, we need to take our country back.

52:35.140 --> 52:36.460
Is that incitement to violence?

52:36.460 --> 52:37.300
I don't think that.

52:37.300 --> 52:38.660
I think we need to take our country back, just that?

52:38.660 --> 52:41.220
No, because I might say that.

52:41.220 --> 52:42.380
I might say we need to take our-

52:42.380 --> 52:43.900
I say that all the time.

52:43.900 --> 52:46.860
Again, I walk around drunk just screaming at everybody.

52:46.860 --> 52:48.620
I thought you wanted us to take you back.

52:48.620 --> 52:51.140
Exactly, I was very confused.

52:51.140 --> 52:52.620
My messaging needs to work.

52:52.620 --> 52:54.940
But let's go to the January 6th example, right?

52:54.940 --> 52:57.980
To say, hang Mike Pence, that's incitement to violence.

52:57.980 --> 52:58.940
Yeah.

52:58.940 --> 53:03.940
To say, go get Nancy, that's incitement to violence.

53:04.100 --> 53:05.420
Yeah, yeah, it's very clear.

53:05.420 --> 53:06.820
Again, I don't think that's the big problem.

53:06.820 --> 53:08.580
The big problem is the gray area.

53:08.580 --> 53:12.780
But yeah, and the other problem is just how to get,

53:12.780 --> 53:16.500
how to technically find the large scale of comments

53:16.500 --> 53:19.140
and posts and so on that are doing

53:19.140 --> 53:20.020
this kind of clear-

53:20.020 --> 53:21.140
Yeah, but it's something for you to solve.

53:21.140 --> 53:21.980
I understand, I understand.

53:21.980 --> 53:23.700
I mean, don't ask me those questions.

53:23.700 --> 53:26.620
Well, I have to say, some of that is motivation,

53:26.620 --> 53:29.260
some of that is vision, and some of that is execution.

53:29.260 --> 53:32.180
So for example, just to go briefly on a dark topic,

53:33.580 --> 53:35.700
something I've recently became aware of is

53:36.820 --> 53:38.740
Facebook and Twitter and so on.

53:38.740 --> 53:43.020
People post violence on there, like videos of violence,

53:43.020 --> 53:47.460
child porn, some of the darkest things in this world.

53:47.460 --> 53:51.780
And to find them at scale is a difficult problem.

53:51.780 --> 53:55.140
And to act on it aggressively is a difficult problem.

53:55.140 --> 54:00.140
But that, I think part of this motivation,

54:00.700 --> 54:03.140
like saying this is a big problem, we need to take this on,

54:03.140 --> 54:07.220
we need to find all the darkest aspects of human nature

54:07.220 --> 54:10.380
that rise and appear on our platform and remove them

54:10.380 --> 54:14.820
so that we can create a place for humanity to flourish

54:14.820 --> 54:16.140
through the process of conversation.

54:16.140 --> 54:17.820
But it's just hard, it's just really hard.

54:17.820 --> 54:19.740
When you look at like millions of posts,

54:19.740 --> 54:24.620
trillions of interactions, it's wild with the amount of data.

54:24.620 --> 54:27.620
But where we are now with social media

54:27.620 --> 54:30.100
seemed wild and impossible five years ago, right?

54:30.100 --> 54:30.940
Yes.

54:30.940 --> 54:34.660
I actually, what frustrates me is I think there are people

54:34.660 --> 54:37.700
who have politicized this issue in unnecessary ways.

54:37.700 --> 54:40.340
Everyone, regardless of their politics,

54:40.340 --> 54:42.100
should support what you just said.

54:42.100 --> 54:46.620
Investing our money, maybe grants from the federal government

54:46.620 --> 54:49.460
in AI-skilled people like you

54:49.460 --> 54:52.980
figuring out ways to get violent videos off of it.

54:52.980 --> 54:54.900
That shouldn't be political.

54:54.900 --> 54:57.060
Well, some of that also requires being transparent

54:57.060 --> 54:59.620
from a social media company perspective

54:59.620 --> 55:03.660
and transparent in a way that really resists being political.

55:03.660 --> 55:06.260
To be able to be transparent about your fight

55:06.260 --> 55:11.180
against these evils while still not succumbing

55:11.180 --> 55:14.740
to the sort of the political narratives of it.

55:14.740 --> 55:17.100
That's tricky, but you have to do that kind of,

55:17.100 --> 55:19.420
and walk calmly through the fire.

55:19.420 --> 55:22.180
That's what Twitter feels like if you're being political.

55:22.180 --> 55:24.780
It's like a firing squad from every side.

55:24.780 --> 55:26.500
As a leader, you have to kind of walk calmly.

55:26.500 --> 55:30.460
Right, and that is where we need a new generation

55:30.460 --> 55:33.540
of people who will have diverse politics,

55:33.540 --> 55:35.100
but will stand up against that, right?

55:35.100 --> 55:37.380
I mean, the lesson from after the Civil War

55:37.380 --> 55:39.460
is where progress is made,

55:39.460 --> 55:41.780
the war doesn't solve problems of hate.

55:41.780 --> 55:44.060
Where progress is made is where you have local leaders

55:44.060 --> 55:46.540
and others who stand up and say, we can differ,

55:46.540 --> 55:48.940
but we're gonna stop calling people

55:48.940 --> 55:50.460
from certain backgrounds monkeys,

55:50.460 --> 55:52.820
which was a common thing to do at that time.

55:52.820 --> 55:55.660
Jews are still called monkeys in certain places, right?

55:55.660 --> 55:56.940
People have to stand up

55:56.940 --> 56:00.300
while still maintaining their political differences.

56:00.300 --> 56:02.140
Several hundred thousand people died.

56:03.180 --> 56:06.580
What made this war such a deadly war?

56:06.580 --> 56:08.300
It's extraordinary how many people died,

56:08.300 --> 56:09.980
more than half a million.

56:09.980 --> 56:13.300
And this was without a single automatic rifle,

56:13.300 --> 56:14.740
without a single bomb.

56:14.740 --> 56:16.700
It was mostly in hand-to-hand combat,

56:16.700 --> 56:21.140
which is to say that these 600,000 or so people who died,

56:21.140 --> 56:23.500
they died where the person who killed them was standing

56:23.500 --> 56:25.580
within a few feet of them.

56:25.580 --> 56:26.940
And that's really hard.

56:26.940 --> 56:28.900
Most of the killing that happens in wars today

56:28.900 --> 56:30.420
is actually from a distance.

56:30.420 --> 56:33.180
It's by a drone, it's by a bomb, it's by a rocket,

56:33.180 --> 56:35.860
or by an automatic weapon.

56:35.860 --> 56:40.060
And just to make this even more focused, to this day,

56:40.060 --> 56:42.260
the deadliest day in American history

56:42.340 --> 56:43.780
is during the Civil War.

56:43.780 --> 56:46.420
September 1862 in Antietam,

56:46.420 --> 56:51.420
more than 22,000 Americans killed one another hand-to-hand.

56:52.220 --> 56:54.540
There hasn't been a day that deadly in American history

56:54.540 --> 56:55.380
since then.

56:55.380 --> 56:58.380
That's amazing considering the technological changes.

56:58.380 --> 57:00.700
What was in the mind of those soldiers on each side?

57:00.700 --> 57:02.780
Was there conviction for ideas?

57:02.780 --> 57:04.740
Did they hate the other side?

57:04.740 --> 57:07.340
I think actually they were fighting out of fear.

57:08.260 --> 57:10.620
What we know from reading their letters,

57:10.620 --> 57:12.820
what we know from the accounts,

57:12.820 --> 57:16.580
is that yes, they're ideas that are promoted to them

57:16.580 --> 57:17.940
to get them to the battlefield.

57:17.940 --> 57:19.780
They believe in what they're doing,

57:19.780 --> 57:21.340
but here it's the same as World War I.

57:21.340 --> 57:23.180
And I think the Civil War and World War I

57:23.180 --> 57:25.020
are very similar as wars.

57:25.020 --> 57:27.260
You are in these horrible conditions.

57:27.260 --> 57:29.100
You're attacked and you have the chance

57:29.100 --> 57:33.420
to either kill the other side and live or die.

57:33.420 --> 57:35.260
And you fight to live

57:35.260 --> 57:38.340
and you fight to save the people next to you.

57:38.340 --> 57:40.060
What is true about war?

57:40.100 --> 57:42.180
What is both good and dangerous about it

57:42.180 --> 57:45.620
is you form an almost unparalleled bond

57:45.620 --> 57:46.700
with those on your side.

57:46.700 --> 57:49.620
This is the men under arms scenario, right?

57:49.620 --> 57:51.740
And that's where the killing goes.

57:51.740 --> 57:52.740
And it's a civil war,

57:52.740 --> 57:55.780
which means sometimes it's brother against brother,

57:56.900 --> 57:57.740
quite literally.

57:57.740 --> 58:00.940
And what it teaches us is how human beings

58:00.940 --> 58:04.780
can be put into fighting and will commit enormous damage.

58:04.780 --> 58:06.060
And that's why this happens.

58:06.060 --> 58:07.740
It goes on for four years.

58:07.820 --> 58:10.620
Just the extensive research you've done

58:11.460 --> 58:13.900
on this war for this book,

58:13.900 --> 58:15.620
what are some of the worst

58:15.620 --> 58:17.540
and some of the best aspects of human nature

58:17.540 --> 58:19.540
that you found?

58:19.540 --> 58:22.140
Like you said, brother against brother.

58:22.140 --> 58:24.060
That's pretty powerful.

58:24.060 --> 58:25.140
They're both, right?

58:25.140 --> 58:27.580
So the level of violence that human beings are capable of,

58:27.580 --> 58:29.940
how long they're able to sustain it.

58:29.940 --> 58:31.060
The South should not have,

58:31.060 --> 58:33.060
the Confederacy should not have lasted in this war

58:33.060 --> 58:34.380
as long as it did.

58:34.420 --> 58:38.140
By the end, I mean, they're starving

58:38.140 --> 58:39.860
and they keep fighting.

58:39.860 --> 58:43.660
So the resilience in war of societies

58:43.660 --> 58:47.980
and the power of hate to move people.

58:47.980 --> 58:49.940
What are the bright sides?

58:49.940 --> 58:52.620
You see in Lincoln and Grant,

58:52.620 --> 58:55.180
who I talk about a lot in the book as well, Ulysses Grant,

58:55.180 --> 58:57.500
you see the ability of empathetic figures

58:57.500 --> 59:00.500
to still rise above this in spite of all the horror.

59:00.500 --> 59:04.100
Lincoln went to visit more soldiers in war

59:04.100 --> 59:06.380
than any president ever has,

59:06.380 --> 59:09.540
often at personal peril because he was close to the lines

59:09.540 --> 59:10.460
and he connected.

59:10.460 --> 59:12.060
It wasn't propaganda.

59:12.060 --> 59:14.340
There weren't always reporters following him.

59:14.340 --> 59:18.220
He was able to build empathy in this context.

59:18.220 --> 59:21.540
And I think, as I said, war is horrible as it is,

59:21.540 --> 59:24.100
often gives opportunities to certain groups.

59:24.100 --> 59:26.220
So African-Americans, former slaves,

59:26.220 --> 59:29.060
are able to prove themselves as citizens.

59:29.060 --> 59:31.580
Jews did this an enormous number in World War II.

59:31.580 --> 59:33.660
Henry Kissinger, who I wrote about before,

59:33.660 --> 59:35.940
he really only gets recognized as an American.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.460
He's a German Jewish immigrant.

59:37.460 --> 59:38.540
He's seen as an American

59:38.540 --> 59:40.980
because of his service in World War II.

59:40.980 --> 59:44.820
So the bright side of this is that often in the case of war,

59:44.820 --> 59:49.100
on your own side, you will let go of some of your prejudices.

59:49.100 --> 59:50.980
Ulysses Grant has a total transformation.

59:50.980 --> 59:55.420
He goes into the Civil War, an anti-Semite and a racist.

59:55.420 --> 59:57.780
He comes out with actually very enlightened views

59:57.780 --> 01:00:00.300
because he sees what Jewish soldiers

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:02.180
and what African-American soldiers did.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.740
What's Ulysses Grant's story?

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.340
What do you learn from him?

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:08.900
Is he a hero or a villain of this war?

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.460
I think he's a hero, though he's a flawed hero,

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.500
as all heroes are.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.780
He's a man from Ohio and Illinois

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.620
who was really a failed businessman time and again,

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:27.900
and had an ability to command people in war.

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.420
Where did this come from?

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.500
He was a clear communicator and an empathetic figure.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.220
He tended to drink too much,

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.900
but he was the kind of person people wanted to follow.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:37.900
They trusted him.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.820
And so in battle, that became very important.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.140
And the second thing is he did his homework.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.940
He had a sense of the terrain.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.500
He had a sense of the environment he was operating in,

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.180
and he was ruthless in pursuing what he had studied.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.860
So he turns out at battles like Vicksburg and elsewhere

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.820
to actually undertake some pretty revolutionary maneuvers.

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.460
And then he figures out that the advantage now

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.900
is on his side in numbers,

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.220
and he just pounds Lee, pounds him to death,

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.660
similar to what the United States does

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:12.540
at the end of World War II with Germany and Japan.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.300
He comes out of the war, Grant does.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.740
He's a believer in union.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:20.260
He wants to protect former slaves and other groups,

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.460
and he tries to use the military for that purpose.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.540
He's limited.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.580
And then as president, he tries to do that as well.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.860
Right now, we still use many of the laws

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.660
that were passed during Grant's presidency

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.020
to prosecute insurrectionists.

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.300
So the 900 or so people who have been prosecuted

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.220
for breaking into the Capitol

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.980
and attacking police on January 6,

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.420
those insurrectionists, they've been prosecuted

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.940
under the 1871 anti-Klux Klan law.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.740
So that's a big accomplishment by Grant,

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:49.580
and we still benefit from it.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.620
The problem is Grant was not a great politician.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.300
Unlike Lincoln, he didn't give good speeches.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:59.340
He wasn't a persuasive figure in a political space.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.500
And so he had trouble building support

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.260
for what he was doing,

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.620
even though he was trying to do what in the end,

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.260
I think, were the right things.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.980
What was the role of the KKK at that time?

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.780
So the Kulaks Klan is formed at the end of the Civil War

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.300
by Confederate veterans, first in Tennessee,

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.460
in Pulaski, Tennessee, and then it spreads elsewhere.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:18.300
And there are other groups that are similar,

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.300
the Red Shirts and various others.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:24.420
These are veterans of the Confederate Army

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.220
who come home and are committed to continuing the war.

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.700
They are gonna use their power at home

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.820
and their weapons to intimidate and if necessary,

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.980
kill people who challenge their authority,

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:40.420
not just African-Americans, Jews, Catholics, various others.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.660
They are going to basically protect

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.100
the continued rule of the same families

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.100
who owned the slaves before

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:51.820
in post-slavery Tennessee and post-slavery South Carolina.

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.340
And when we get to voting,

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.380
they're often the groups

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.660
that are preventing people from voting.

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.740
The white sheets and the ritual around that

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:02.420
was all an effort to provide

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.860
a certain ritualistic legitimacy and hide identity,

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.660
though everyone knew who they were.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:08.940
Oh, so that whole brand,

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.420
that whole practice was there from the very beginning.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.580
Have you studied the KKK's history a little bit?

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.100
I have and there are a number of other historians

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.540
who have too, so I've used their research as well.

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.380
I'm kind of curious.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.740
I have to admit that my knowledge of it

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.140
is very kind of caricature knowledge.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.180
I'm sure there's interesting stories and threads

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:27.660
because I think there's different competing organizations

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.860
or something like that within the United States.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.940
And I feel like through that lens,

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.580
you can tell a story of the United States also

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.420
of these different groups.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.740
They're often business associations.

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:38.180
I mean, there's a lot of work

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:41.220
showing that actually people joined the KKK

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.580
for the reasons I just laid out,

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:45.300
but also because it was networking for your business.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.100
You gained legitimacy in the area that you were in.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.820
So these were community groups that were formed

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:54.140
to help white business people.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.420
They helped white sheriffs get elected.

01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:58.460
What we have to understand today

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.540
is when we're debating policing,

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.020
this history matters enormously, right?

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.500
I have nothing against police.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.940
My cousin, one of my closest relatives,

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:08.460
just retired from 25 years

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.700
in the New York Police Department.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.020
Thank God he survived.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:11.860
I have deep respect.

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.020
I'm one of the best public servants I know.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.460
But what we also have to recognize

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.180
as we respect police officers

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:20.540
is that for many communities in our country,

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:21.660
they know this history.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.500
And the KKK in the 1870s and in the 1930s,

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.420
you look at any KKK organization as I have in my research

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:32.460
and you find the police chiefs are the KKK members,

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:34.980
the local police officers, local judges,

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:37.420
because it was how you became police chief.

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:41.660
So these groups infiltrated some of the main institutions

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.300
in our nation.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:44.140
I don't even think they infiltrated.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.180
I think they were part of those institutions.

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.460
The deeper question today in the 21st century

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:51.820
is one, how much of that is still there

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.020
and how much of the history of that

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.980
reverberates through the institutions.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.100
And I'm making the latter point

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.220
that it's not there that much now,

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:00.860
but people remember it.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:04.100
And some people would even say it's not there at all,

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:07.260
that there is not institutional racism in policing.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.420
But if that's the case,

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.180
then you can also say that

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:15.220
if there is not direct institutional racism there,

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.340
what is it, the echoes of history still have effects?

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.420
Of course, and that's really important

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.820
and that we have to take that seriously.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.460
That's not an excuse for people then saying

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.300
nasty things about the police,

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.420
but it is what we have to recognize.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.260
Look, I'm Jewish and there are certain

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:35.700
elements of Russian behavior today I see in Ukraine

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.060
that reverberate with the history of how

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:41.900
my grandparents dealt with pogroms in Russia, right?

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.980
Even though what Putin is doing in Ukraine

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.340
might not technically be a pogrom,

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.980
that history matters in how I view these issues

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.540
and that's a reality.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.740
Yeah, I went to 7-Eleven recently

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.300
and what did I eat?

01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:57.780
I ate one of their salads.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.060
I'm sorry, I love 7-Eleven, I'm sorry.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.660
I ate one of the salads and got like terrible food poisoning.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.220
I was suffering for like four days

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.340
and now I can't, I love 7-Eleven.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:11.340
I love going to 7-Eleven late at night in sweatpants

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:12.580
and just I escaped the world.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:14.540
I'm listening to an audio book

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.140
and now every time I pass that salad

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.980
for the rest of my life, I would have hate for that salad.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:23.820
So history matters, even if the salad

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:26.900
is no longer have any bad stuff in it.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.940
It's probably the lettuce or something, whatever,

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.660
mostly for humor's sake, but I'm also giving

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:37.820
a kind of metaphor that history can have an individual

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.660
and a large-scale society effect on human interactions,

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.740
both the good and the bad.

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.860
If you actually recommend to me offline books on the KKK,

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.180
they'll be really happy to.

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:53.380
There were a few mentioned in the footnotes in my book here.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.940
And also in part, because I also want to understand

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.380
the white nationalism, white supremacists,

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.500
Christian supremacists or Christian nationalism,

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.660
all those different subgroups in the United States

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.500
and elsewhere in the world.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.460
I'm a bit, my mind has been focused

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.220
on some of the better aspects of human nature

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:13.060
that it's nice to also understand

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.460
some of the darker aspects.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.340
Let me ask you sort of a personal question for me.

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.900
Do you think it's possible, do you think it's useful

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.340
to do a podcast conversation with somebody like David Duke

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:31.340
or somebody, this was somebody that everybody knows

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.900
so it's not like you're giving a platform to somebody

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.900
that's a hidden member of the KKK

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:42.180
or like a, it's sort of putting a pretty face

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.500
on some dark ideas, but everybody knows.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.220
And so now you're just exploring,

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:49.020
you're sitting across the table, maybe not in his case,

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.700
maybe somebody who's an active KKK member

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:57.700
sitting across from a person that literally hates me, Lex.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.860
I think that's fascinating to explore that way.

01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:05.140
I think so long as what you are doing

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:09.380
is not boosting someone, so taking an obscure figure

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:12.580
and making that figure now famous,

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.220
but if it's someone who's already infamous

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:17.820
and it helps us to understand them,

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.420
and as so long as your effort

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.180
is to ask them tough questions, which you do, right?

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:26.380
You don't give them all the questions in advance,

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.740
you don't have limitations on what you can ask.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:32.420
So long as it is a real interview, not pablum,

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.860
then I'm for it.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.500
What I'm against is a softball interview

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.020
that allows someone to sound reasonable when they're not.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.020
But the way I've seen you do this

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.340
when you've had figures like that,

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.420
I won't name who I have in mind,

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:45.700
but when I've seen that is, I think that's useful

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.060
because honestly, the historian in me

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.620
and the citizen in me wants to understand.

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:54.940
My Jewish grandfather always was the first

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:58.460
to be against any effort to suppress anti-Semites

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.740
because his view was he wanted to know who they were

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:02.980
and he wanted to know what they thought

01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:04.700
so he could be prepared.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.940
And I also see, perhaps as a historian,

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.860
you may be able to appreciate this kind of thing,

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:13.340
that's probably how you see the world,

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:17.100
but there's several ways to see a human being,

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.980
like Vladimir Putin is an example.

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.780
One is a political figure

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:25.740
that's currently doing actions on the world,

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:28.580
geopolitics internally, the politics of Russia,

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.980
but there's also that human being in a historical context.

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:35.020
And collecting information about that person

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:37.540
in the historical context is also very valuable.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.260
So you could see interviews with Hitler

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:45.260
in 39, 40, 41 as being very bad and detrimental

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.620
to all that is good in the world.

01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:49.900
But at the same time,

01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:52.420
it's important to understand that human mind,

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.060
how power affects that mind,

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.140
how power corrupts it, how they see the world.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.620
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:01.060
I would be all in favor and maybe he will

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.300
if Vladimir Putin would sit down with you.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.140
Absolutely.

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.460
I don't think you're boosting someone like that

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.580
when you ask them tough questions.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.460
In fact, I think that's what we need to do.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:11.820
Those sorts of figures tend to insulate themselves

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.060
from tough questions.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.020
So just to restate,

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:17.860
I am for the Lex Friedman interview

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.140
of those sorts of figures.

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:23.100
I am not for the puff piece on Fox and Friends

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.340
where they just come on and they're asked,

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.180
oh, isn't it, tell us what you think of this.

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:30.020
Yes.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:30.860
Tell us what you think of that.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.540
So there's a balance there because a lot of people

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.740
that interview somebody like Vladimir Putin,

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:39.180
all they do is hard-hitting questions.

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.540
They often demonstrate a lack of knowledge

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.940
of the perspective of the Russian people and the president.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.540
There's not an empathy to understanding

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:48.260
that this is a popularly elected,

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.660
you can criticize that notion,

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.580
but this is still a theater that represents

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.420
the beliefs of a large number of people

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.780
and they have their own life story.

01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:56.620
They see the world.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.420
They believe they're doing good for the world.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:03.420
And I don't, that idea seems to not permeate the questions

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.740
and the thoughts that people say

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:09.220
because they're afraid of being attacked

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.540
by the people back home, fellow journalists,

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.020
for not being hard enough.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:13.860
Well, maybe.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.740
I think that's probably true.

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:18.020
I think in my experience with interviewers

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.460
is that a lot of them are really lazy.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:23.180
You're not, which is why I like talking to you.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.060
Can I just say, okay, this is not you saying it.

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:26.980
Can I just rant?

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:29.220
If you're sitting across from Xi Jinping

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:34.100
or from Vladimir Putin, you should be fired

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:37.820
if you have not read at least several books on the guy.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:40.820
The surprising lack of research

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.460
that people do leading up to it.

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:45.500
So you need to be a historian or a biographer.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.660
You need to be the kind of person

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:48.540
that writes biographies or histories

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.340
before you sit in front of the person.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:53.940
Not a low effort journalist.

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.820
And it's so surprising to me

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.500
that I think they're probably really busy

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.380
and it's probably not part of the culture

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.780
of the people that do interviews

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.180
to do deep, deep investigative.

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.780
You need to be the kind of person that lives that idea.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.540
See it as a documentary that you work on

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:09.860
for three years kind of thing.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:13.220
Anyway, of course some journalists do do that

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.220
and they do that masterfully

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.900
and that's the best of journalism.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.940
But I think a lot of the times when the questions are,

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.860
as you said, out of touch with the society

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.860
that person is leading,

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.980
it's because the interviewer hasn't taken the time.

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:28.460
And I understand you can't be an expert on every subject

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:29.740
but you can do what you do, right?

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:31.660
You read my book to prepare for this.

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:32.500
You look things up.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.580
You had a sense of the person you're talking to

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.660
and you put the time in to do that.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:39.900
This is what I always tell my students, right?

01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.780
The secret to success in anything

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.100
is outworking other people.

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.060
Be more prepared, right?

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.940
What you show is like an iceberg.

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.500
It's the tip of the iceberg, right?

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.060
Is what people see.

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.060
It's all the work that goes on below the surface.

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:54.860
And if you work hard enough, which I aspire to do,

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.900
at the end of the day, just like an animal farm,

01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:01.020
you'll be like the horse boxer and slaughtered unjustly

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:02.860
by those that are much more powerful than you.

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.060
But you'll be happy when you're slaughtered.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:07.500
You have lived for the right ideal

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.780
and history will remember you fondly.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.780
Okay, what about Robert Lee Lee?

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.580
So he's the Confederate general that you mentioned.

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.940
Was he a hero or a villain?

01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:16.780
To me, he's a villain.

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.780
Many people treat Robert Lee Lee as a hero.

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:20.740
And one of the points I make in the book

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.260
is we have to rethink that.

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.860
And it's very important for our society

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.740
because Robert Lee Lee pops up all over our society,

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.020
names of schools, names of streets.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:31.940
And he also embeds and justify certain behaviors

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.300
that I think are really bad.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.700
Lee was a tremendous general.

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.700
He had the weaker side and he managed to use

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:42.020
maneuver, secrecy and circumstance

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.540
to give himself so many advantages

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.540
and win so many battles he should have lost.

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:48.340
So in terms of the technical generalship,

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.380
he's a great general.

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.340
But Lee at the end of the war

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.020
never wants to really acknowledge defeat.

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.100
What he acknowledges at Appomattox

01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.100
is that his soldiers will have to leave the battlefield

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.540
because they have not won on the battlefield.

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:05.940
But he refuses to do what Grant asks him,

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.820
which is to help sell his side on the fact

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.060
that we're going into a post-war moment

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.820
where they don't have to see themselves as losers,

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:16.020
but they have to get on board with change.

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.820
Real leadership is convincing people who follow you

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.460
that they have to change when they don't wanna change.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.340
Lee refuses to do that.

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.020
He says to Grant, I quote this in the book,

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:27.860
he says to Grant at Appomattox,

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.220
if you wanna change the South,

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.660
you have to run your army over the South three or four times.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:35.180
He's not gonna do anything, he's not gonna help.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:39.820
And he becomes a figure who people rally around

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:42.300
in the rest of his life and even after he dies.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:47.300
So it is as if at the end of World War II,

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.220
Hitler had been allowed to just retire

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.020
and he didn't go back into politics, but yet he was there

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:57.900
and he continued to have meetings with former Nazis

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.740
and people would rally around the idea of bringing back

01:15:00.740 --> 01:15:02.260
or going back to Hitler's ideas.

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.140
Think of how harmful that would be.

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:07.900
Lee played that kind of role after the war.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.940
And I think it's one of the problems we have now.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.060
I don't think we should continue to revere him

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.820
because it justifies too much

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.580
of what the Confederates stood for.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.300
And that's the difference that you highlight

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.980
between World War II and the Civil War

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:25.260
that in the case of Hitler, there was an end to that war.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.380
There's a very distinctive clear end to that war.

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:30.020
And you also make the case that World War II

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:34.940
is not a good example, not a good model of a war

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:36.820
to help us analyze history.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:39.140
It's given Americans the wrong idea of what war is

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.540
because World War II ends as most wars don't end.

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.140
World War II ends with a complete defeat

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.580
of the German army and the German society

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:49.220
and the near complete defeat of Japan.

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:53.860
And we're both sides in different ways, except defeat.

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:55.260
What I'm pointing out in the book

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:59.700
is that most wars don't end with one side accepting defeat.

01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.860
And generally the war continues after the battles end.

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.660
This is something that's hard for Americans to understand.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.300
Our system is built with the presumption

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.780
when war is over, when we sign a piece of paper,

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:09.860
everyone can go home.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.020
It's not what happens.

01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.740
I mean, Civil War is a special case.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:17.220
It's especially a strong case of that

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.620
because the people that fought the war

01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.140
are still living in that land.

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.100
That's exactly right.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.420
And in this case, some of them are leaders also.

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:25.940
Many of them become the leaders of the very areas

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.900
that they were leading before.

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:30.500
And I think that's another lesson here too

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.740
that we did undertake after World War II,

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:33.820
though in a flawed way.

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:35.740
We had a Nuremberg system.

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:38.100
We did prohibit at least Nazi leaders

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.140
from coming back into power.

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:41.420
We made an exception for the emperor in Japan,

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:44.060
but we generally followed the same rule in Japan.

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:46.700
Whereas in the United States, as I point out,

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:48.580
many of the leaders of the Confederacy,

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.180
first of all, don't surrender.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:52.300
They flee to Mexico.

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:55.380
Then they come back after they lose in Mexico a second time,

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:56.580
they come back to the United States

01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:58.900
and they get elected to office.

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.700
The guy who writes the election laws in Texas,

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.180
Alexander Watkins Terrell,

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.180
most people don't know this even in Texas.

01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:07.660
He was a Confederate general, fled to Mexico,

01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:10.220
so he committed treason by joining the army

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.380
of Maximilian, emperor of Mexico,

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.140
who was put in power by Louis Napoleon.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:16.060
After Maximilian's defeated,

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:18.220
Alexander Watkins Terrell comes back to Texas,

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:20.420
runs for the state legislature,

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:22.540
and then writes the election laws.

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.380
It's crazy.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.460
Can you make the case for that,

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:27.460
that that's a feature of the American system, not a bug,

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:31.020
that that is an implementation of justice that you forgive,

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.860
that you don't persecute everybody

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:35.740
on the other side of the war?

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.580
Maybe, and I think that's a good feature

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:40.180
in terms of lower level individuals,

01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.380
but I think a bad feature of our system

01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:47.380
is we do allow elite figures who have committed wrongdoing,

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:50.300
we give them many ways to get out of punishment.

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.620
You are more likely to be punished in this society

01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:55.700
if you do something wrong and you're not an elite figure

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.060
than if you are an elite figure.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:58.340
There should be a proportional,

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.700
like forgiveness should be equally distributed across.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.420
And it's not, and it's not.

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.460
But we could change that.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.940
We could fix that.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:06.780
How do we fix that?

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:08.860
But how do we fix that?

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:10.340
What I think was argued at the end,

01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.780
this is one of the really important things

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:12.620
about studying history.

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.100
You learn about ideas that were not pursued

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:17.100
that could be pursued today.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.620
At the end of the Civil War,

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:21.540
there was an effort to ban anyone

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:24.220
who was in a leadership position in the Confederacy

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:26.660
from ever serving in federal office again.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.420
That's the third element of the 14th Amendment.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.460
It's in the 14th Amendment.

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:33.620
The 14th Amendment clause three says

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.500
that if you took an oath of office,

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.180
meaning you were elected to office,

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:40.620
you're an elite figure, and you violated that oath,

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.020
you can still live in the country.

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.300
You can still get rich,

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.100
but you can't run for elected office again.

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:50.380
And we've never really implemented that.

01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.300
Is it obvious that everybody who is in a leadership position

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:57.100
on the Confederate side is a bad person

01:18:57.100 --> 01:18:59.420
for the future of the United States?

01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:02.060
Or is that just a safe thing to assume

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.740
for the future of the nation?

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.540
I think it's the latter.

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.180
People do things for all kinds of reasons,

01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.140
and sometimes they have regrets.

01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.940
That's also why we have the pardoning capability.

01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:13.020
You could pardon someone individually

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.380
if they show you that they've changed.

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:16.780
And it would only create fairness,

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:19.700
because right now, let's say, Lex,

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.460
you take out a huge, huge loan,

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.980
and you don't pay your loan back,

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.980
that will go on your credit,

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:28.060
and you won't get a big loan again.

01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:29.900
You don't get to say,

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:30.860
just give me another chance.

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.820
You're gonna have to prove.

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:33.660
Right.

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:36.740
I think about holding public office in the same way.

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:40.700
If you've violated your credit rating on that,

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.420
you should have a much higher road to go

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.980
to prove to us that you should be back in office.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:52.180
How did the war end, in quotes?

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.500
So you said, and you make this case in the book,

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.340
in some sense, the elements,

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:00.980
the tensions behind the Civil War continue to this day,

01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.340
but officially, how did the war end?

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:06.780
So officially, the war ends at Appomattox

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:10.180
in the early spring of 1865,

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:14.180
when Grant has pretty much smashed Robert E. Lee's army.

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.860
Appomattox Courthouse is a small town in Virginia,

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:19.260
and the two men meet,

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:21.660
and there are portraits of this

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:24.220
as a painting of it we have in the book.

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.260
And Grant and Lee sign a paper

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.180
which basically allows Lee's soldiers

01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:30.740
to leave the battlefield

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:33.260
and leave with their sidearms to go back home.

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.780
That's pretty much the end.

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.340
Jefferson Davis, who's the president of the Confederacy,

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.660
goes into hiding.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:43.620
He's later captured and then not convicted.

01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:46.340
But there's no formal settlement in the way there is

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.660
at the end of World War II,

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.060
where they meet in Yokohama Bay,

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.700
the U.S. and Japanese leaders in Sinai.

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:52.580
This is not that.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.100
So what stands out to you as brilliant ideas

01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.860
during this time and actions of Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln?

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:02.540
So I mentioned his values.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.620
I think a number of the things that he does

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:06.220
that are quite extraordinary.

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:09.420
First, in emancipating the slaves.

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.620
Now, the slaves were freeing themselves,

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:14.700
but Lincoln recognizes that he needs more labor

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:15.980
in the Union army.

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:20.020
And he recognizes that there's still a lot of resistance.

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:22.780
And what he does is he makes the case

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.300
for freeing the slaves based on the argument,

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:28.580
not just of the moral value of that,

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:31.100
but based on how that will benefit the North.

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:34.020
He's able to convince non-abolitionists

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:36.540
to pursue abolitionist policies

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:39.420
by serving their own interests.

01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.300
What he's basically saying by 1863 or 64 is,

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.420
I can ask for more white soldiers

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.060
or I can bring in former slaves.

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:47.300
Would you like me to take your son

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.620
or would you like me to put in?

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:50.220
It's the same thing Franklin Roosevelt does

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:51.340
during World War II.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:53.940
He says, we need to build more planes and more tanks.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:56.220
And I'm sending all the soldiers off to Europe.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.620
I've got all this African-American population in the South.

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:00.220
Wouldn't you like me to move them up to Chicago

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.060
so we can win this war and build things in the factories?

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:08.060
So Lincoln uses the war to move the country forward morally,

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:10.820
even if at times he's convincing people

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:12.900
by using other reasons.

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.260
And I think that's great politics.

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:16.940
I guess that's one of the components of great leadership

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:21.940
is do the right thing for the wrong reasons.

01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:27.260
Publicly sounding wrong reasons, yeah.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.260
Find ways to move people.

01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.420
What we talked about before,

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.700
different stories move different people.

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:34.700
So you can tell different stories.

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.020
He tells one set of stories to the religious leaders

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.500
who are abolitionists and a different set of stories

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.540
to the New York bankers.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.420
And that's leadership.

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:43.740
You tell different kinds of stories

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.700
to move people to a new position.

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:50.460
The other thing Lincoln is really brilliant at

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.860
is managing the international side of this.

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.740
So one of the real dangers for the Union

01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.140
is that the British will come in

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.260
on the side of the Confederacy.

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:00.740
The Confederates expected the British would,

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:02.340
because again, the Confederates were selling

01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.060
all their cotton to Britain.

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.820
And they knew that the British leadership, first of all,

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.940
was very happy to work with slave-holding societies,

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:10.060
even though they didn't have slaves.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.660
And number two, that they believe the Union

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:13.620
was getting too strong

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.580
and threatening the British and Canada.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.980
So there were many reasons the British

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.140
might have gone in with the Confederates.

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:23.500
Lincoln mixes sticks and carrots with the British.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.980
He threatens them.

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:28.340
And when the British actually try to send diplomats

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:31.340
to negotiate with Southerners, he interdicts that.

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:34.020
He basically initiates a quarantine of the South.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:36.500
On the other hand, he reaches out to them

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.460
and tries to show that he wants better relations

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.300
and makes the argument that they will actually benefit more

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.060
from having the industrial capability

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:44.180
of the Union on their side.

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:46.180
So he's a very good diplomat.

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.060
He is considered to be one of the great presidents

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.180
in the history of the United States.

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.780
Are there ways that he failed?

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.860
Is there things he could have done better?

01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.540
So he failed in the ways that most great leaders fail,

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.100
which is that he had a terrible succession plan.

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.060
His vice president, who I spend a lot of time on

01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:08.180
in the book, Andrew Johnson,

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.900
who is probably our worst president ever,

01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.660
Andrew Johnson had no business being anywhere

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.020
near the presidency.

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:19.020
Andrew Johnson was the only Southern Senator

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.020
who did not secede.

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:23.020
And so even though he was a Democrat,

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.940
Lincoln wanted to show that he was creating a unity ticket

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:29.420
when he ran for reelection in 1864.

01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:30.740
This happens today, right?

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:33.220
So he put someone on as vice president

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.500
who he didn't even like,

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:36.860
but who we thought was politically useful.

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:39.940
Problem is, when Lincoln was assassinated,

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:40.940
this guy took over.

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:44.140
Andrew Johnson was drunk at his own inauguration.

01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.860
The guy was a true drunkard.

01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:49.060
He was not prepared to lead in any sense,

01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:51.380
intellectually, politically,

01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:54.220
and he was against most of the principles Lincoln was for.

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:59.380
And the irony is that when Lincoln is assassinated

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:01.340
in April of 1865,

01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:02.460
Andrew Johnson takes over

01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.620
and he has all the war powers Lincoln had.

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.620
That was not good planning by Lincoln.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.700
And we can look back on it now and say,

01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.260
even though Lincoln is the first president

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.380
who was assassinated,

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:15.260
he should have known that there were people coming for him.

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.940
It wasn't inevitable that he'd be assassinated,

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:18.140
but he should have had a backup plan

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.540
for who would take over,

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:22.260
hopefully someone who was capable of doing the job,

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.940
and Andrew Johnson was not capable.

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:25.260
So for me, for a person,

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.220
if I were to put myself in Lincoln's shoes

01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:29.940
or any leadership position shoes,

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:33.060
it is difficult to think about what happens after my death,

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.420
after I'm gone, right?

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.860
To plan well.

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.980
But at the same time,

01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:42.980
if you care about your actions to have a long-term impact,

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:46.180
it seems like you should have a succession plan

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.580
that continues on the path,

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.260
that continues to carry the ideals that you've implemented.

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:55.500
So I'm unsure why people don't do that more often.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.060
Like I wonder how much Vladimir Putin

01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:01.660
spends percentage of time per day

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:05.140
thinking what happens after he's gone

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:07.860
to help flourish the nation and the region

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.660
that he deeply cares for.

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:11.700
I wonder, and the same as for other presidents,

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.700
Donald Trump, Joe Biden,

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.060
they might think politically,

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:19.820
like how do I guarantee there's a Democrat or a Republican?

01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:23.340
But do they think like visionary for the country?

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.180
I don't know, I wonder.

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.140
I think that's very rare,

01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:28.340
and I think what I understand from the literature

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:30.860
among business people who talk about this a lot

01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:34.420
is what ends up happening is you become so powerful

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:37.060
you assume you're always gonna be in power.

01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:38.260
You convince yourself of that.

01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:40.860
You convince yourself that the end is far away.

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.580
And of course, for Lincoln, the end could have been far away.

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:45.060
He was healthy, he was only in his 50s.

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.180
He could have lived a lot longer,

01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:49.820
but it also ended fast as it could.

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:53.220
And my understanding is that most Americans

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:55.100
don't prepare their wills in the States,

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:57.300
and it doesn't matter whether they're rich or poor.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:59.940
They assume things are just gonna go on

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:02.380
because it's not fun to think about this.

01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:03.220
Yeah.

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:06.020
But I feel like it's freeing.

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:08.580
Like, you know what I did, which is interesting?

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.660
Before I went to Ukraine, I recorded a video.

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.180
I set up a whole thing where I record a video.

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:14.460
What happens if I die?

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:15.780
I record a video to release,

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:20.180
and I gave my brother access to my passwords,

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:21.820
so that, and I gave him instructions.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.820
You're not allowed to look at this,

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:25.100
but please publish this if I die.

01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:28.340
And you know, that made me, it sounds silly and ridiculous,

01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:31.300
but that made me feel free

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.500
to do the best thing I wanna do.

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:34.940
It's like, it's a liberating,

01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:36.580
so like, I guess that's for your will,

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:40.060
but also, like, do the best possible damn job you can.

01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:42.620
I feel like as a leader, having a plan,

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:45.820
what happens if you, and not if you fail, if you die,

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:50.820
if you, or you lose some of the oomph,

01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:52.820
some of the power, some of the momentum

01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.580
that is driving you currently,

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:57.740
that there's going to be a handoff where you will still,

01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.940
and you will still be remembered as a great man or woman

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:03.140
but you identify one of the other problems, right,

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:05.940
which is one of the other reasons why someone like Lincoln

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:09.500
or certainly Henry Kissinger doesn't create a successor

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.620
because you're afraid they're going to steal your passwords.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.540
You're afraid they're gonna steal the power from you.

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:14.380
That's true.

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:15.500
You had to find someone, your brother,

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.140
hopefully who you could trust.

01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:19.540
No, no, no, let's just be clear.

01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.620
I love my brother, but he's a troll.

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.780
So there's a feature on the password,

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.740
on whatever password manager I may or may not use,

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:30.100
and there's a bunch of services like this.

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:32.180
It's interesting, I don't know if you know about this.

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.740
I've learned about all of this,

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:39.820
is you can have them request access

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:42.740
and it's gonna wait 30 days before it gives them access.

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:46.620
So it's kind of has this built-in trust,

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:50.180
trust padding, but it's interesting.

01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:52.780
I mean, to me, on that aspect is just to have a plan

01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:53.820
in all aspects of life.

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:56.780
This is for leadership in your private life.

01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:00.220
What happens to not just your will

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:02.860
and your wealth or whatever,

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.540
but what happens to other stuff like social media

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.940
and all of that in this digital world?

01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:10.220
Anything you care about if you want it to live on,

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.220
and that's the problem,

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:16.220
but unless you can devise a technical solution like that,

01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:19.300
you have to give someone power now.

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.140
And that's the tricky thing.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:23.420
I mean, democracy is a kind of technology.

01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:25.380
You're gonna have to figure out how to do it correctly,

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.980
how to have that power propagate,

01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:29.340
and especially during war,

01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:34.340
how you get everybody together into this warmongering mood,

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:39.260
and then how do you come down from that and just relax?

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.100
Precisely.

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.180
So in some sense, that's, with Andrew Johnson,

01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:46.900
that was the problem, is the over-centralization of power.

01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:48.500
It was the over-centralization of power,

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:53.500
but it was also that Lincoln had a designated successor

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:56.500
who was going to do and tried to do everything

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.460
that ran against what Lincoln was doing,

01:29:58.460 --> 01:29:59.700
and it set the country back.

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.860
We went forward at the end of the Civil War,

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:03.860
and then we went backward,

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:06.780
more so than we would have if there had been a new election,

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.460
because if there had been a new election,

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.780
there still would be reason for that person running,

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:11.940
even if they were on the other side,

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.260
to try to find some compromised positions.

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.860
Andrew Johnson inherited power

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.460
with very few limitations on how he used that power.

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.900
Congress wasn't even in session.

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:23.980
And so this became very directly a problem

01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.260
because Andrew Johnson started pardoning Southerners,

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:28.460
allowing them to come back into power.

01:30:28.460 --> 01:30:31.100
So he had like a few months where he just went wild.

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:33.820
Yeah, it's giving the car keys

01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.540
to someone who's not prepared to drive,

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.780
but decided that they're gonna do

01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:39.540
what they want with the car for a while.

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.740
All right, is there any level

01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:46.780
to which power corrupted Lincoln, a war president?

01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.540
Yes, I do think there were some areas,

01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:51.340
and I think that even though he was a great president,

01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.980
not our greatest president,

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:56.540
maybe one of the greatest figures of our history,

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:57.500
he was flawed.

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.500
One is his problem of succession,

01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:04.500
but also I think Lincoln over invested

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:05.820
in the power of the presidency.

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:10.540
He came to believe too much in the role of one man

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:15.540
and not in creating a more balanced approach to governance.

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:16.620
And that's a function of war.

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.260
That's where war is dangerous.

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:21.300
War has an inherent centralizing power

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.980
in a democracy, and that is dangerous,

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.460
because even when you have the best of people running a war,

01:31:27.460 --> 01:31:29.460
that gives them a lot of power to make decisions.

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:30.860
Yeah, how do you come down from that?

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.300
I see that was Zelensky and Putin currently.

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.140
It's a war.

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:34.980
How do you come down?

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:39.700
Because Ukraine and everybody, anybody in a war,

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:43.020
especially if you're fighting for the ideal of democracy,

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.540
it seems like war is anti-democratic.

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:46.380
It is.

01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:48.340
So how do you come down from that?

01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:51.180
That what's the interesting mechanism of,

01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:52.540
some of it is leadership.

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.700
You have to be like a George Washington type figure

01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:56.460
to be able to walk away from power.

01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:58.820
I think you gave the answer right there.

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.180
You need to walk away from power

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.140
or you need to be forced to walk away from power.

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.340
Historically, one of the things that democracies

01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:07.140
have tended to do when they have a chance

01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:09.860
is to vote out of office the victor in the war.

01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:11.340
Think about Winston Churchill.

01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:15.100
Roosevelt is elected to his fourth term

01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:16.620
when he's still in the war.

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:19.500
It's not clear that he would have been elected again,

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.820
let's say he lived on,

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.580
because there is a sensibility

01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:26.580
that the person has become too powerful in this role

01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:28.620
and that someone else should now step in.

01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:30.340
Someone else who's also not a war president

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.500
but has other interests.

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:35.100
So let's hope Ukraine wins this war.

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.220
Zelensky should then step down

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:41.140
or someone else should be voted in.

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.860
It will be dangerous if he remains president.

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.660
Let's say he wins somehow and a true victory,

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.500
just as a hypothetical.

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:49.660
He should not be praised.

01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:53.460
He should be praised, maybe given a nice villa,

01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:57.220
but someone else should take over

01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:00.580
because the problem is that he's gonna have too much power

01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:03.260
and honestly, he's going to be too out of touch

01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:05.420
with what the country needs after the war.

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:08.380
What do you think would have happened if Lincoln had lived?

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:11.060
That's the sort of counterfactual view of history.

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:11.980
It's an interesting question

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.580
that probably you think about a lot,

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:14.700
this gets really a lot.

01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:16.500
What would have happened if he didn't get assassinated?

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:17.940
It's a reasonable question

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:20.060
because it was not inevitable he'd be assassinated.

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:21.740
He could have had more protection that night.

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:24.380
He'd invited Ulysses Grant to go to the theater with him

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:25.980
and Grant and his wife didn't go.

01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:26.820
If they had been there,

01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:28.460
there would have been more protection for Grant.

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:32.060
So you would have had at least double the security there.

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:34.180
So there are many ways in which he might not have died.

01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:37.940
I think it still would have been a difficult transition,

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.020
but I think there were a few things

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:39.860
that would have been better.

01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.340
First of all, Lincoln would not have pardoned

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.740
all of these Confederate leaders

01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:44.740
and allowed them to come back into power.

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:46.620
Lincoln also would have been a better politician

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:49.660
at holding his Republican coalition together.

01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:52.140
And I think Lincoln was more committed

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.380
to empowering former slaves and others.

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:56.460
So we still would have had a lot of conflicts,

01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:59.500
but I think what would have been a degree of difficulty

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:04.020
was doubled or tripled because Lincoln was removed

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:06.900
and the opposite came into power with Andrew Johnson.

01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:08.500
So you don't think there's a case you made

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:13.500
that Andrew Johnson turned out to be a bad decision,

01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:16.220
but the spirit of the decision is the correct one?

01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:18.540
No, I think it was a terrible decision

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:21.380
because you should never put someone one step away

01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:23.740
from enormous power who's not prepared.

01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:24.900
Oh, in that sense.

01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:26.660
So in that sense, I got it.

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.820
But the other, the spirit of the decision,

01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:32.700
meaning you put somebody who represents

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.460
a very opposing viewpoint than you.

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:38.860
Well, I'm for that so long as that person is on board

01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:41.940
with some of the basic values that you're pursuing

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:44.020
and that person is capable of doing the job.

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:45.500
Well, do you think that was obvious to him

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.580
that Andrew Johnson was not capable of doing the job?

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.420
Yes.

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:52.980
I mean, everyone recognized that, but it made sense.

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:55.260
I mean, what Lincoln has to be praised for

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.540
is in the midst of a war,

01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:59.140
when at that point he was not doing well,

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.980
the war was not going well, he ran for reelection.

01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.660
He didn't try to postpone the election.

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:05.540
He didn't try to do anything.

01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:08.140
And so he needed all the help he could get when running.

01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:09.780
And so he wanted to have someone on there

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:11.020
who looked like a unity candidate

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:13.660
who could appeal to some Southerners.

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:16.860
So it made sense from a political point of view,

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.260
but it created a really big problem.

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.700
And there were people who said

01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:24.300
he should have removed Johnson as soon as he was elected.

01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:26.340
And in retrospect, he probably should have.

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:28.260
How gangster is that to during a war

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:30.020
still run the election?

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:30.860
It's extraordinary.

01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:34.420
I mean, he, Lincoln believed in democratic values.

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:35.500
He also believed he would win,

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.900
but he knew it was not guaranteed.

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.620
And it's interesting for people who don't know this,

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:41.340
the reason we have mail-in balloting in the US

01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:42.540
is because of that.

01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:47.540
So almost what, I think it's almost a million union voters

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:53.100
are away from their homes.

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.100
And so how do they vote?

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:57.140
As soldiers, as nurses, they vote by mail.

01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:59.100
The post office delivers their ballots.

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.460
That's why we have mail-in balloting.

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:03.180
What about the other counterfactual question

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.780
of what would have happened

01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:06.500
if Confederate States won the war?

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:08.380
The Confederate States had won the war.

01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:11.700
You would have seen, I think, a separate country

01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:12.540
in the South.

01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:14.220
You would have seen two countries

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:15.860
and that Confederate country would have been

01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:17.100
a smaller country,

01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:19.020
but it probably would have been able to defend itself

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.980
because it would have actually gotten much richer

01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:21.820
than it was.

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:22.660
It was poor at the time,

01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:24.460
but through its cotton trade and other things,

01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.180
it would have been recognized by Great Britain,

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.940
by France, by other societies.

01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:31.780
And you would have seen a Southern Republic.

01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:33.740
I don't think you would have seen

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:36.220
that Southern Republic dominate the continent.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:39.780
The Union had the men and people and had the resources,

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.540
but you would have seen a rival Republic

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:45.500
to the United States in the South.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.380
Do you think they had interest to dominate the continent,

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:49.900
to take over the Union?

01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.220
They had a foreign policy.

01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:52.180
They had a plan.

01:36:52.180 --> 01:36:53.180
Many have written about this.

01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:54.980
They had plans, many Southerners did,

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:57.500
of expanding into the Caribbean,

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.260
which was actually more feasible.

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.660
They did not have the personnel to occupy

01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:03.300
so much territory going out West,

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:04.580
if you think about the amount of land

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:05.860
that had to be covered.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:09.020
But they had the nautical capabilities and naval power

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:13.460
and the money to dominate islands in the Caribbean.

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.500
And those islands were important for their trade.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.660
So there were many Southerners

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.380
who wanted to take control of Cuba,

01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.860
wanted to take control of Haiti

01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:22.460
and the Dominican Republic.

01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:24.860
And so you probably would have seen

01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:27.100
Southern warfare in those areas.

01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:31.580
From a counterfactual history perspective,

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:35.140
can you make the case that secession

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:37.620
would have been created a better world?

01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:39.260
Like if we were sitting today

01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:40.660
and do back to the future thing,

01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:42.820
the secession in this context,

01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:46.020
if we put aside the suffering

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:49.180
and the loss of life in the war,

01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:51.340
that we'd be in a better world today?

01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.100
Just look into that political climate.

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.340
And can you also make the case that actually

01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:59.300
this outcome of the Union winning the war is the better one?

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:02.500
I think the Union victory is by far the better outcome,

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.460
because I think what you would have had otherwise

01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.860
is you would have had a slave republic in the South

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:10.140
that would have encouraged slavery

01:38:10.140 --> 01:38:11.460
in other parts of the world,

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.180
would have exported slavery,

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:17.060
and would have necessarily been hostile

01:38:17.060 --> 01:38:19.980
to many of the positive changes that occur in the Union,

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:22.300
the movement toward progressive reforms,

01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:25.020
creating cities with health codes and public education

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:25.860
and many of those things.

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.980
Public education really develops in the North

01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:30.860
as a way of training workers who are being paid

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:32.460
to be better workers in a factory.

01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.140
There's a reason you don't educate slaves,

01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.140
because if you educate slaves, they'll rebel.

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.500
Yeah, so don't you think there'll be a huge pressure

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:43.100
from the North to abolish slavery anyway?

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:43.940
There would have,

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:45.420
but I think the South could have survived

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:46.460
without another war.

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.460
I mean, I think the way that slavery

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:52.220
would have ended in the South,

01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.500
if it didn't end with the Civil War,

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.500
it would have been with another war.

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:56.940
I guess the deeper question is,

01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:00.860
is it better to work through your problems together,

01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:02.620
or is it better to get a divorce?

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:04.340
I think in this case,

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:06.460
it was better to work through the problems,

01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:07.540
not even working through them together,

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:08.740
it's better to work through the problems

01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:11.700
where one side has the resources

01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:14.460
to incentivize you to work through the problems

01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:16.060
rather than leaving you on your own

01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:18.060
to go your own direction.

01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:21.500
I think the argument against the Union winning

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:22.940
would be the argument that would be made

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.860
by those who believe they suffered

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:26.660
from Union power later on.

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.380
So you could argue if you're a historian

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.500
of Native Americans,

01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.700
if you're a historian of the Philippines,

01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:35.060
you could argue some of the areas

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:37.420
where this newly united nation

01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:38.780
coming out of the Civil War

01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:41.500
was able to use its power to spread its influence,

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:44.380
it would have been harder for the Union to do that

01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:47.740
if the Union had to deal with a rival to the South.

01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:51.340
So as a historian, the Union won.

01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:54.900
To which degree are the people from the Union,

01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.380
there is now the United States,

01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:58.060
the writers of the history,

01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:01.780
that color, the perspective of who's the good guys

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:02.860
and the bad guys?

01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:05.900
So this is such an interesting question because-

01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:07.820
I like how you take every question I ask

01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:09.580
and make it into a better question.

01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:10.580
No, no.

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.100
I deeply appreciate it.

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.460
I'll ask, every time I ask some ridiculous question

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:16.500
and you go, that's really interesting.

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:17.900
No, because they're really good questions,

01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:19.060
they're thoughtful questions.

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:22.460
Actually the best questions are not the simple ones, right?

01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:27.460
So the axiom is that the winners

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:31.300
write history and that's usually the case, right?

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:33.140
Most of the history I learned about Ukraine

01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.420
when I was growing up was written by Russians.

01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.100
It was Russian history of Ukraine.

01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:40.380
Most of the history of Europe has been written by Germans

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.460
and French and British citizens, right?

01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:44.300
I mean, so usually it's that way.

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:46.460
And for the most part, our history has been written

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:48.740
from a sort of Northeastern point of view,

01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:49.820
but it's very interesting.

01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:52.260
The history of the years after the Civil War

01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.860
that I focus on in this book

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:56.260
has largely been written by the losers

01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:59.420
because the Union and its legacies,

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:00.420
and I grew up in New York,

01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.780
so I'm growing up as a legacy of that, right?

01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:04.540
Those were individuals who wanted to write about

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.580
what happened long after the Civil War

01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:08.580
when the North got rich.

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:10.220
All those beautiful buildings in New York,

01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:12.580
all that wealth in New York, it's 1880s, 90s,

01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:15.220
it's the late 19th century, it's the Gilded Age.

01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:17.180
And that's what Northerners wanna write about, right?

01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:18.580
Because there's glory there.

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:21.340
The 20 years or so after the Civil War,

01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:25.460
the years that really count, 1865 to 1880 or so,

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:28.380
those years are ugly, it's messy.

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:29.740
And so who wrote about them?

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:31.180
Southerners wrote about them.

01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:34.140
And they wrote a story that was about

01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:38.860
Northern carpetbaggers and corrupt African-Americans.

01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:41.460
And this is the story that Americans learned

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.220
until a few years ago.

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:45.100
I've gone around the country talking about this book,

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:46.180
and the number of people have told me

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:48.220
they never learned this basic history

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:49.780
because they grew up in Chicago,

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:50.980
not because they grew up in Texas,

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:52.740
because they grew up in Chicago.

01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:54.660
And the story they were told, the Civil War ended,

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:57.260
oh, now let's talk about the Chicago World's Fair in 1893

01:41:57.260 --> 01:42:00.220
and how Chicago is coming of age as this great city.

01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:03.780
We don't like to write history in our country

01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:05.540
that's not about glory.

01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:07.540
I'm all for the greatness of our country,

01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.100
but you become great by studying your failures

01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.940
as well as your successes.

01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:13.580
And that's a real problem we have.

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:16.140
And I would love to see a kind of humility

01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:18.220
from a history perspective.

01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:19.660
One of the things that always surprised me

01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:23.260
just coming from the Soviet Union to the United States,

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:25.820
as you've, I think, spoken about,

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:28.060
is the perspective on World War II

01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:30.580
and who was the critical component of winning the war.

01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:32.340
Obviously, in the Soviet Union,

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:34.660
it's a great patriotic war.

01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:38.420
The Soviet Union are the ones that suffered

01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:40.940
and often actually don't emphasize the suffering.

01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:44.300
They emphasize the glory that they defeated this huge evil.

01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:47.260
But then you listen to the United States perspective on this

01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:50.580
and it's almost like the,

01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:52.420
I mean, there's several ways of phrasing it,

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.460
basically, the United States won the war.

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.340
Without the United States,

01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:56.820
it would be impossible to win the war.

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.140
There were the turning point.

01:42:58.140 --> 01:42:59.820
There were the last,

01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:03.380
my last, my everything, that song.

01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:05.980
My first, my last, my everything.

01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.900
So that, and I'm sure I went through it,

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:13.900
what growing up in maybe after war in Britain,

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.260
I wonder if there's history books written there

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.100
that basically say,

01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:18.940
and they could also make a pretty strong case,

01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.820
that Britain was central to the turning point.

01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:24.180
You could really make a strong case

01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:26.940
that like Churchill and Britain

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:28.500
were like the turning point of the war,

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:31.620
that they're responsible for some of the first failures,

01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:32.740
major failures of Hitler

01:43:32.740 --> 01:43:34.700
from a military strategy perspective.

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:38.540
But that's interesting to look at that very recent history

01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:40.220
from very different perspectives.

01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.620
And it's the same problem with the Civil War.

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.060
We wanna tell the story of the Union winning the war

01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:45.380
and then everything is good.

01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:46.220
Yeah.

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.300
And it's not the way it worked.

01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:52.740
What I'm really trying to get at is

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.820
when you love your country, you have to study the failures.

01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.780
Because by studying the failures,

01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:58.980
that's how you improve yourself.

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:01.700
And that's where you see where real courage is.

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.620
It's actually that Lincoln failed for so long

01:44:04.620 --> 01:44:06.380
that makes him a great president.

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:09.900
He lost more battles than he won, but he learned.

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:10.900
And he got it right in the end.

01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:11.940
Same with Ulysses Grant.

01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:12.980
I don't want generals.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.340
I'm just echoing Lincoln here.

01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:15.180
I don't want generals.

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:16.060
I don't want leaders who think

01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:17.260
they're gonna get it right the first time

01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:19.220
because they're never gonna get it right the first time.

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:21.500
You never get it right the first time in an AI experiment.

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:25.100
It's those who can work through failure learn from failure.

01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:28.700
And we as a society have to start doing that better.

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:31.340
We have to not just trumpet the successes.

01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:33.980
Let's talk about where we failed as Republicans,

01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:36.180
as Democrats, as independents.

01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:37.660
And let's move forward from there.

01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:41.980
In recent years have been a kind of movement

01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:44.660
of highlighting some of the hypocrisy,

01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:46.580
sort of highlighting the racism,

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.060
the fact that many of the founding fathers

01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:50.220
were slave owners, that kind of thing,

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:55.220
sort of highlighting from the current ethics of our world,

01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:58.580
showing that many of the people involved in the war

01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:00.460
on each side were evil.

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.740
What do you think about that perspective on history?

01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:03.980
I think it's super valuable.

01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:08.980
I think we should expose the gap between ideals and practice,

01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:12.620
but that doesn't mean we should throw away

01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:15.020
the great people who were also hypocrites

01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:17.020
because everyone I've studied is a hypocrite.

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:17.860
I'm a hypocrite.

01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.580
I think I'm a pretty good father.

01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.700
Luckily, my son is an even better mother,

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:24.740
but they're parts of me.

01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:27.420
I often find myself telling our children to do things

01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:29.060
that I didn't do, right?

01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:30.940
But they're smart and they recognize that

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.460
and they learn something from that.

01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:35.740
So let's not cover over the hypocrisy,

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:37.700
but let's not throw people away for being hypocritical.

01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.060
Here's my view of Thomas Jefferson,

01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:41.340
which is similar to my view of Abraham Lincoln, right?

01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:44.300
These are incredibly insightful, thoughtful people

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.380
who added so much to our country,

01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:50.060
but they also created flawed systems.

01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:54.220
And one of, excuse me, Jefferson's flaws

01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:55.940
was even though he saw all the evils of slavery,

01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:58.260
he was a terrible farmer and he could not imagine

01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:00.420
living the lifestyle he lived without slaves.

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.780
He could never work his way out of that,

01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:04.900
but that doesn't make the Declaration of Independence

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:05.740
less valuable.

01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:07.020
In fact, it makes it more valuable.

01:46:07.020 --> 01:46:09.220
There's more that we can learn from that.

01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:12.220
And to me, on the hypocrisy side,

01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:14.420
many of the people that participate in cancel culture

01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:16.420
and these kinds of movements

01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:20.180
that call everything is racist and so on,

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:24.420
sometimes they're highlighting properly

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:26.740
the evils in our current society,

01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:29.740
but the hypocrisy they have is not realizing

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:34.140
if they were placed in Germany in the 40s,

01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:36.300
if they were placed in the position

01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:40.540
of being a white Christian during slavery

01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:42.100
at the founding of this country,

01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:43.700
they would do the same thing.

01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.780
They would do the evils that are not criticizing,

01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:51.060
most of them, so that it takes a truly heroic human

01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:54.140
to think outside, to be aware of all the evils

01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:58.460
going on around you and take action.

01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:02.100
It's easy now on Twitter to call people as racist.

01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:05.460
What's hard is to see the racism when you're living in it

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:07.340
and your wellbeing is funded by it.

01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:08.860
Yep, I think that's right.

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:10.900
I think to analyze ourselves

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:13.420
and look honestly in the mirror is very hard.

01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:16.420
I also think, I make this point in actually all of my books,

01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:20.100
the real, and it's an Eli Wiesel point,

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.380
that a lot of the evil in our world

01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.300
is the evil of silence and just looking away.

01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:28.580
And one form of that on Twitter is just hitting like,

01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:32.620
it's a cheap way of pretending

01:47:32.620 --> 01:47:35.180
you're doing something that's important, right?

01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:36.740
After the Civil War,

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:38.500
there's all sorts of bad stuff that happens.

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:39.980
I talk about it a lot.

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:42.380
There always are people there who could stop it.

01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:45.860
Most people are not responsible for the bad activities,

01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.660
but most don't do something to stop it.

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:52.100
And when I say do something, I mean really do something.

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:55.220
Yeah, really, and that's also to push back and push back.

01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:00.020
Silence on Twitter is not what Eli Wiesel was talking about.

01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:01.580
Right.

01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:04.860
So sometimes silence on Twitter is the courageous action

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.420
because you wait and think and learn

01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:10.140
and have patience to truly understand the situation

01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:12.100
before you take actual action,

01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.340
not participate in the outrage crowds on Twitter,

01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:17.340
the hysteria of cancellation.

01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:19.300
What's hard to do is to speak up

01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.820
when everybody else is silent.

01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.820
That's what's hard to do.

01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:23.220
Right, and to speak up against those

01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.340
who you thought were on your side.

01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:27.140
Yes, exactly.

01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:30.340
Good luck to those on the left who speak up against the left.

01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:32.900
And the same, good luck to those on the right

01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:34.540
who speak up against the right.

01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:37.420
It's a lonely place.

01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:38.500
It's a painful place.

01:48:38.500 --> 01:48:40.260
That's why walking in the center is tough.

01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.180
You get attacked by both sides.

01:48:42.180 --> 01:48:45.020
So it's a wonderful, wonderful journey.

01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:47.820
And you know, what's interesting to me

01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.020
and what I learned writing this book,

01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.060
every book is a journey.

01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:53.900
What I learned in the laboratory of this book, right,

01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:57.140
was a lot of those figures who do stand up,

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.060
even in their own lifetime,

01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:01.860
they don't get the accolades they deserve,

01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:03.100
but they make a difference.

01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:05.980
And that's maybe not enough comfort

01:49:05.980 --> 01:49:08.260
because you want to see benefits in your own lifetime.

01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.380
But I think it really matters.

01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:10.660
And many of the figures I talk about

01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:12.660
were not even well known in their time.

01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:14.620
So you can make a difference.

01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:17.860
You do impart something small in the universe

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:19.420
that can grow into something better.

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.780
And we shouldn't forget that.

01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:22.820
Yeah, that's why I admire Boxer, the horse.

01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:23.660
I will work harder,

01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:27.740
even if it gets sent to the slaughter by the evil pigs.

01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:28.900
You're on Orwell today.

01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:29.740
I love you.

01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:30.740
I'm on recently.

01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:34.580
Animal Farm is one of my favorite books.

01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:35.420
I've been recently,

01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:38.300
I've just been rereading 1984 now.

01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:40.660
It's been politicized, that book in general.

01:49:40.660 --> 01:49:41.940
But to me, it's a love story.

01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:42.780
It is a love story.

01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:46.460
That there's a, like love is the,

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:49.100
like it's a story of an oppressive government,

01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:50.060
a surveillance state,

01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:53.180
and the nature of truth being manipulated by wartime,

01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:54.580
da, da, da, da, da, so on.

01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:59.020
But the beacon of hope in the human heart

01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:00.260
that pulls you out,

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.780
that wakes you up in a world like that

01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:04.900
is a love of another human being.

01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:05.780
It's transcendence.

01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:06.900
I totally agree.

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:07.740
My understanding,

01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:08.820
you would know better than I would,

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:11.300
is that it's now a best-selling book in Russia again.

01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.140
1984?

01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:13.420
Yeah, it's actually been downloaded more.

01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:15.060
There was a piece on NPR.

01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:15.900
I heard about this actually.

01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.220
Yeah, yeah.

01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.260
Well, I hope it's because they're looking for love.

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:20.700
That's what I was just gonna say.

01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:23.340
Hopefully not in all the wrong places.

01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:25.900
Hey, there's no such thing as the wrong places.

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:27.340
But that's my opinion.

01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:29.100
I'm the one that showed up naked and drunk

01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:30.420
to your classroom.

01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:31.820
I still surprised that was you.

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:35.220
I was wearing a wig, I'm sorry.

01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:36.100
Quick pause.

01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:36.940
Can I take a breath?

01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:37.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:41.940
And we're back.

01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:45.420
John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln.

01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:47.380
In his diary, as you write in your book,

01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:49.220
he wrote about Lincoln,

01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:52.580
our country owed all her troubles to him,

01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:56.460
and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment.

01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.940
The country is not what it was.

01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:00.460
What was the idea of the country

01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:02.980
that John Wilkes Booth believed in?

01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:04.140
You talked about this country

01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:06.980
that just constantly being repeated in his writing.

01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:10.060
For John Wilkes Booth and many other people

01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:11.940
who are close to the southern part of the country

01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:13.500
in the Confederacy,

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:15.740
they believe the country should be a democracy

01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:19.140
for white people, a bounded democracy.

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:21.780
And Booth was horrified,

01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:22.980
and we have to empathize with it.

01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:26.340
Not sympathize, but recognize how strange it seemed to him

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:28.020
that all of a sudden,

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:30.620
those who were slaves were now soldiers with guns.

01:51:30.620 --> 01:51:32.740
And he was particularly offended

01:51:32.740 --> 01:51:35.220
when he saw in Washington, DC,

01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:37.500
a group of African-American Union soldiers

01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:40.220
holding southern prisoners of war.

01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:42.540
And the world was turned upside down for him.

01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:44.500
Democracy for him, he believed in democracy,

01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.540
but democracy for white people.

01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:50.940
And that justified mistreating black people for him.

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:55.940
So country means white people.

01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:56.780
Yeah.

01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:59.700
And I don't think it's that different from...

01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:00.980
And white Christians.

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.620
White Christians, yes.

01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:05.740
Yeah, he was not arguing for Jewish emancipation either.

01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:08.980
I don't think that's really different

01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:10.860
from what we've seen in the 20th century

01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:13.380
for people who justify ethnic cleansing or genocide.

01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:17.740
Let's go to the extreme example of Hitler again

01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:19.340
that we've talked about before.

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:20.820
His view was actually,

01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:24.580
he claimed he wanted a democracy for Germany.

01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:27.060
He wanted a democracy of the right Germans.

01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:29.420
And he wanted those who he saw infecting

01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:31.540
and mongrelizing the society out.

01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:34.780
That's in essence what John Wilkes Booth thought.

01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:37.220
The scary thing is those kinds of ideas,

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:39.140
you can put a pretty face on them.

01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:40.780
Like you don't have to use,

01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:44.020
and maybe Hitler didn't until the war started,

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.140
or even parts of the war,

01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:49.140
make it so clear that he was going to do something

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:53.020
that you just want the certain kind of Germans

01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:55.740
that have made Germany a great nation

01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:57.700
to be the people that are running that nation,

01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:01.100
and other people who are not truly interested in,

01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:03.100
don't hold the interest of the country at heart.

01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:04.620
That they should go elsewhere

01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:06.540
where they can flourish also is wonderful.

01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:09.340
But like the good Germans,

01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:10.900
they've built all these amazing things

01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:13.540
which should give them the power and not to the others.

01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:16.380
And you can put a bunch of flowery language around that.

01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:19.060
Precisely, it's the argument that's made all the time today

01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:21.140
against immigration.

01:53:21.140 --> 01:53:23.100
That the wrong people are coming into our society.

01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.340
It's ironic,

01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:27.300
because it's often made by those who themselves are immigrants.

01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.620
History teaches us that those who have arrived as immigrants

01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:31.700
are no more likely to like those who come.

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.700
In fact, they might be against the next group

01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:34.620
for just this reason,

01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:36.100
because they think they're the right group.

01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:39.820
Can you describe to me if it's useful at all

01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:41.780
to know the difference,

01:53:41.780 --> 01:53:44.340
if there's a difference between white nationalism,

01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:46.420
white supremacism,

01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:49.020
and Christian nationalism?

01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.100
Is there an intersection between them?

01:53:51.100 --> 01:53:53.700
I've heard these terms used,

01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:55.660
oh, separatism too, right?

01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:58.380
Is there an interesting distinction

01:53:58.380 --> 01:54:01.660
that permeated that history that still lasts today?

01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:06.020
I think there's a long history in the United States

01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.580
of a belief in white supremacy.

01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:09.660
And it's not unique to the United States.

01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:11.820
We actually inherit this from Europe.

01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:15.580
And white supremacy is the belief

01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:17.780
that for whatever reason,

01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:21.100
those with lighter color skin,

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.820
usually of Northern European extraction,

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:26.140
are superior, have more rights,

01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:28.100
are the better people to make decisions,

01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:28.940
all sorts of things.

01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.460
And it's an aesthetic judgment

01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:32.500
as much as it is a political judgment.

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.540
And that gets embedded in our society, right?

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:35.620
We inherit that.

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:40.020
Christian nationalism is the presumption

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.060
that it's not just your race,

01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:44.940
but now it's also your Christian belief.

01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:47.380
And that is actually relatively new.

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:49.820
There are little pieces of that in our history.

01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:53.300
But many of those who are white supremacists,

01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:54.660
even those in the Confederacy,

01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:56.860
are not Christian nationalists

01:54:56.860 --> 01:55:00.060
because they don't agree on which kind of Christianity,

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:01.380
and they don't view those

01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:03.820
who are from a different denomination of Christianity

01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:05.300
as being good Christians.

01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:08.460
There isn't this big tent Christianity in the 19th century.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:12.620
This notion that there is one Christian nation

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.300
and that we're all part of it,

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:17.540
that's actually really a 20th century creation.

01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:19.540
It precedes the evangelical movement,

01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:22.020
but it's been made even more popular.

01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:24.220
But it would not make sense to a Confederate

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:26.380
to say we're a white Christian nation.

01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:30.220
It would make sense to say we're a white Protestant nation

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.220
because they didn't consider Catholics good Christians

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:34.180
or a white Presbyterian nation.

01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:38.100
And so that's something new.

01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:40.340
And I think what's particularly dangerous

01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:43.220
about this notion of Christian nationalism

01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:45.900
is it creates this false history,

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:48.020
saying we've always been together as Christians.

01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:50.300
That's always how we've denied, defined ourselves,

01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:51.540
and that's not accurate.

01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:52.980
Well, one interesting thing.

01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:57.460
So I recently talked to a left-leaning

01:55:57.460 --> 01:56:01.140
or maybe a far-left political streamer named Destiny,

01:56:01.140 --> 01:56:01.980
Stephen Bonnell.

01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:03.780
I don't know if you're familiar with him.

01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:07.060
He does live streaming debates with people.

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.060
It's very passionate.

01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:08.900
I've heard of this.

01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:09.740
My students have told me.

01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:10.860
I've not actually seen it.

01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:12.900
My students are always up on the most hip things.

01:56:13.860 --> 01:56:15.580
No, the funny thing about him,

01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:17.420
he's already considered like a boomer.

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:18.780
He's already the old streamer

01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:20.180
because he's been doing it for 10 years.

01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:21.780
He's not the cool kids anymore.

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:25.460
Anyway, he goes into some difficult political territory

01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:28.460
and he actually had a mini conversation with Nick Fuentes.

01:56:29.420 --> 01:56:32.740
And he says, I mean, some of it is humor,

01:56:32.740 --> 01:56:34.580
but some of it is pretty dark,

01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:37.980
hard-hitting sort of criticism.

01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:41.300
He says that anyone who claims to be a Christian nationalist

01:56:41.300 --> 01:56:46.300
asks them if they would rather have a million people

01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:50.620
who are atheists from Sweden who are white come,

01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:55.620
or if you would rather have a million people from Africa

01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:59.380
who are Christian come, and the truth comes out

01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:01.260
that this is a very surface level,

01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:04.020
this kind of idea of Christian nationalism is still,

01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:06.300
underneath it is a deep racism,

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:08.780
like hatred towards black people.

01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:10.460
I think that's, I'm sure that's right.

01:57:11.140 --> 01:57:12.180
That's the sense I got into,

01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:15.140
is does not seem to have deep kind of,

01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:17.260
yeah, the historical context to it.

01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:21.300
It's just a rebranding of the old kind of hate.

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:24.500
What I think is important though in drawing this distinction

01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:27.220
and why it really matters beyond the history of it

01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:31.980
is someone like Lincoln quotes scripture all the time.

01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:33.820
The second inaugural is filled,

01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:35.980
second inaugural address, Gettysburg address,

01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:38.260
filled with biblical references.

01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:41.820
But he does it in a way that's not Christian nationalist

01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:45.220
because he's using the texts to bring people together.

01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:48.060
He's using it as a fable of humanity.

01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:51.140
And you could say he's not open to Islamic thinking,

01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:53.220
he's ignorant of the Islamic world.

01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:57.100
But as a Jew, I'm a Jew, reading and studying Lincoln,

01:57:57.100 --> 01:57:58.420
I know he's a Christian,

01:57:58.420 --> 01:58:01.140
but I don't feel excluded from his rhetoric

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.420
because I share that Bible.

01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:06.340
We have different views, but I don't feel excluded.

01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.940
It actually brings people together.

01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:10.140
The Christian nationalist approach that we've seen

01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:12.940
in the 20th century, and especially in recent decades,

01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:15.420
is intended to divide people.

01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:17.180
It excludes Jews.

01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:19.060
It excludes Christians

01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:21.660
who don't interpret Christianity their way.

01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.620
And to say that's what we've always done

01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:26.340
is an entire distortion of our country,

01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:29.180
and it also hides why this is so dangerous.

01:58:29.180 --> 01:58:31.300
Insofar as Christianity matters to our country,

01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:33.020
it should be in the way Lincoln uses it

01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:36.660
as a set of common texts that many of us resonate with,

01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:38.260
knowing that we have different rituals

01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:39.660
and different understandings,

01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.940
not as a way to exclude people,

01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:44.500
and not as a cover for racism, which is what it is.

01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.460
It's kind of interesting that you could talk about,

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:49.380
I've talked to a lot of people, Muslim folks,

01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:50.900
Jewish folks, Christian folks,

01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:52.860
there's a way to talk about religion that's inclusive

01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:54.740
and then that's exclusive.

01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:58.020
And it's just been, I've been listening

01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:00.300
to a lot of these interfaith conversations,

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:01.980
and they're awesome.

01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:03.900
They celebrate the beauty of each religion,

01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.500
they banter and argue with each other

01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:09.180
about details and so on, but it feels like love.

01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:11.660
It feels like anybody from any of those religions

01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:14.380
would feel welcome at that party.

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:16.100
Yeah, and I think that's possible.

01:59:17.220 --> 01:59:20.540
Can you tell me about the disputed election of 1876?

01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:21.900
So this is fascinating.

01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:24.580
The 1876 election is one of many elections,

01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:28.500
we've had some recently, that are intensely controversial.

01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:31.380
And they're controversial because they're so close.

01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:33.020
They're controversial because it's not always clear

01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:34.500
who's won.

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:38.700
In 1876, Samuel Tilden, the governor of New York,

01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:41.540
who's running as the Democratic candidate,

01:59:41.540 --> 01:59:44.100
wins more votes across the country.

01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:46.340
So everyone knows he becomes president, right?

01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.540
Wrong, he doesn't become president

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:51.260
because in three states, South Carolina, Louisiana,

01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:54.540
and Florida, it's very, very close.

01:59:54.540 --> 01:59:57.060
And even though Tilden has more total votes,

01:59:57.060 --> 02:00:00.540
if he loses those states, the electors in those states,

02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:02.740
all of which go to the winner of the state,

02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:04.700
would actually make Rutherford B. Hayes

02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:06.620
the Republican candidate president.

02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:07.620
In all three of those states,

02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:10.300
you also have Republican governors who have just lost,

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:13.660
but are still the people who have to certify the election.

02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:16.140
All three states say that Hayes won,

02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:18.180
even though it's very close and disputed.

02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:20.300
So Hayes has won more electoral vote.

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:23.060
Of course, the Democrats don't accept that.

02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:25.260
And so we go into February,

02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:27.780
that the inauguration was done in March, not in January.

02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:29.860
We go from November to February

02:00:29.860 --> 02:00:32.540
without clear agreement on who the president is.

02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:36.420
In the end, there's an agreement that they come to a deal,

02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:39.380
which is where the Democrats will accept Hayes as president

02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:41.060
in return for Hayes doing all the things

02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:43.460
the Democrats want in the South.

02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:46.700
And so in essence, you have a deal made

02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:50.420
that one side will get all it wants

02:00:50.420 --> 02:00:53.420
while allowing the other side to have the figurehead.

02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:56.460
And so in a certain way, this marks a moment

02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:58.900
when the Confederacy wins.

02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:01.180
For example, Hayes has to agree to pull out

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.820
a federal force from the South,

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.220
which means there's no protection

02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:06.140
for fair elections going forward.

02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:08.820
And you'll see in states like Mississippi,

02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:12.220
the number of African-American voters will decline

02:01:12.220 --> 02:01:15.100
and not recover again until the late 20th century.

02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:17.340
So that's what that election does.

02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:19.500
And from 1876 until 1896,

02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:21.220
we have a series of elections that are very close.

02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:25.020
It happens also in 1888

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:27.980
that the person with the most popular vote loses,

02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:30.860
that's Grover Cleveland who loses to Benjamin Harrison.

02:01:31.820 --> 02:01:34.020
And again, we'll have the same issue

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:35.020
where there's a dispute.

02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:39.580
And so what that election shows us, 1876, 1888,

02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:40.820
is that our election system

02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:42.460
and the problem of having an electoral college

02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:43.580
really complicates things.

02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:46.620
It makes it harder for us to come to any kind of consensus,

02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:49.340
any kind of agreement on who's won an election.

02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:51.020
Super important for today

02:01:51.020 --> 02:01:52.860
because most of the 20th century,

02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:55.060
we don't have close elections, so it doesn't matter.

02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:56.380
When we come to a world today

02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:57.660
where our elections are very close,

02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:01.420
our system is not well-designed to deal with those issues.

02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:04.540
Do you draw any parallels with our time

02:02:04.540 --> 02:02:06.140
and what are some key differences?

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:08.300
There's been contested elections,

02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:11.860
Florida, Florida, Florida, through Al Gore,

02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:13.980
and there's been just contested election

02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.420
after contested election.

02:02:15.420 --> 02:02:17.460
And of course, most famously recently

02:02:18.780 --> 02:02:22.700
with the contested election that led to January 6th.

02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:26.260
So I think a couple of parallels and a couple of differences.

02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:28.980
One parallel is that when you have close elections,

02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:32.020
the losing side's never happy.

02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:34.900
It's a myth that when you have a close election,

02:02:34.900 --> 02:02:37.140
the other side just accepts it and it's not,

02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:38.380
that doesn't happen.

02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:40.380
And we need to be attentive to that and ready for that.

02:02:40.380 --> 02:02:43.140
January 6th actually should surprise us,

02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:44.660
not because it happened,

02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:46.460
but because it hadn't happened before.

02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:49.860
People who lose a close election are never happy

02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:51.860
and they always think that something has been done.

02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:53.060
That's one parallel.

02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:55.940
Second parallel is elections are violent.

02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:59.180
We have this myth that our elections are peaceful.

02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:01.020
No, there's always violence involved in one way

02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:03.460
or another, violence in either trying to prevent people

02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:05.620
from voting or violence in preventing people

02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:08.460
from preventing people from voting, right?

02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:12.100
Elections are not peaceful walks in the park.

02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:15.860
And that's why most countries have a centralized system

02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:19.020
to manage elections and provide protection for people.

02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:20.300
We need to think about that.

02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:23.220
A lot of people don't vote because they're afraid,

02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:24.260
they don't wanna take the time,

02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:25.900
but they're also afraid that they're gonna anger someone

02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:28.860
that they're gonna be seen as politicizing an issue.

02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:32.300
Differences, in 1876, there was fraud in the election.

02:03:33.220 --> 02:03:35.020
There were people who voted two, three times.

02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:37.060
One of the things that Ku Klux Klan did

02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:39.260
is it prevented black people from voting

02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:42.700
and that it helped white people go to multiple voting booths.

02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:43.940
And this was quite common.

02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:46.500
In the 1880s, if you went to vote,

02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:48.580
here's how it would happen in a place like Chicago

02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:51.820
and New York, the union boss from your factory

02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:54.060
would come and get you at the factory,

02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:56.220
give you lunch, get you drunk,

02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:58.540
and then drive you from one voting booth to another

02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:00.300
and give you a ballot that you would bring in

02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:03.380
and he would watch you deposit that ballot.

02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:05.740
Sounds pretty nice, not gonna lie.

02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:06.700
I take that right.

02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:08.140
So that's a difference.

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.100
That is not how our elections work now.

02:04:10.100 --> 02:04:12.980
One of our great accomplishments has been to eliminate

02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:14.860
virtually all the fraud in our elections.

02:04:14.860 --> 02:04:16.500
How have we done that?

02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:17.820
By creating safeguards.

02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:20.740
It is very difficult.

02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:23.380
All the evidence we have is that the minimal fraud

02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:26.100
that's occurred in elections are onesies and twosies

02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:28.060
and it's never, in the last 20 years,

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:30.140
had any big difference in the outcome of elections.

02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:32.180
So that's a big difference.

02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:33.860
And then another big difference, I think,

02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:38.180
is that in that time, the Democrats and Republicans

02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:39.900
are on the opposite sides of where they are now

02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:41.580
and that changes everything.

02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:44.540
So the Democrats then are the party of the Confederacy.

02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:46.340
The Democrats are the party of exclusion.

02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:49.340
The Republicans are more the party of economic expansion.

02:04:50.380 --> 02:04:52.740
And the Republicans are the big 10 party.

02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:54.220
We're reversed today.

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:59.220
Do you think because there's much less election fraud now,

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:03.140
like you described, one of the lessons

02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:05.180
we wanna maybe learn from that is

02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:07.660
there doesn't actually have to be election fraud

02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:10.180
for either side to claim there's election fraud.

02:05:10.180 --> 02:05:12.820
It seems like it's more and more common

02:05:12.820 --> 02:05:15.860
and it seems to me that in 2024 election

02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:19.020
in the United States, if a Republican wins,

02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:24.060
there would also be just maybe just as likely

02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:30.300
as if a Democrat wins that there would be

02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:35.740
nuanced claims of election fraud

02:05:35.740 --> 02:05:37.780
because it's become more and more normalized.

02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:40.220
I think what this history shows

02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:42.700
is that our election system makes it easy

02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:43.860
for people to claim fraud

02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:46.900
because it's so unnecessarily complex.

02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:48.740
First of all, we don't have a system

02:05:49.460 --> 02:05:50.300
where the person who gets the most votes

02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:51.380
is necessarily the winner.

02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:53.180
So that already creates one problem.

02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:55.940
Second problem is everything I talk about this in the book

02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:58.420
is controlled at the county level.

02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:01.660
So what happens with Hayes and Tilden in 1876

02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:03.300
is you have one county official who says

02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:04.380
they think one person won,

02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:06.900
another county official thinks says the other person won.

02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:09.380
There's no centralized system.

02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:11.700
It would be as if we allowed every airport

02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:13.260
to control safety in airplanes,

02:06:13.260 --> 02:06:14.420
our airplanes would not be safe.

02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:15.860
Our airplanes are safe because the FAA

02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:17.740
and the National Transportation Safety Board

02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:20.140
have strict universal guidelines

02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:21.380
for what makes for a safe plane

02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:24.100
and therefore our planes generally don't fall out of the sky.

02:06:24.100 --> 02:06:26.580
Our system is very complex.

02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:28.620
It has complex rules and has too many people

02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:31.220
who have authority in too many different places.

02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:34.420
Complexity makes it easier for someone to make an argument

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:36.060
that the wrong thing has been done.

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:37.500
We should simplify the system.

02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:40.340
In Brazil, they had a very close election

02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:42.940
and it's very hard for Bolsonaro

02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:45.540
who lost that close election to claim there was fraud

02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:46.980
because there's a central authority

02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:48.700
run by the judiciary that counted the votes

02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:50.100
and it's just simple.

02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:51.860
It's not about which states,

02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:53.620
it's not about who the county officials were.

02:06:53.620 --> 02:06:55.540
Did he claim or no?

02:06:55.540 --> 02:06:57.700
He has not acknowledged that he lost.

02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:01.340
Right, so to push back on your statement,

02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:03.020
I'm undefeated in monopoly and risk

02:07:03.020 --> 02:07:05.540
because anytime I lose, I walk away

02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:09.540
claiming there was fraud and cheating involved

02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:10.940
and I refuse to believe otherwise.

02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:14.740
I just think that accusations of fraud

02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:17.660
is a narrative that's disjoint from the reality

02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:19.380
of whether there was enough fraud.

02:07:19.380 --> 02:07:21.580
Yeah, yeah, I agree, but I think we make it

02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:23.140
a little easier for that narrative

02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:25.860
by having a complex convoluted system.

02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:27.540
And I wonder if there's other improvements

02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:29.220
that take us into the 21st century

02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:30.860
that allow for electronic voting.

02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:32.220
There's all kinds of improvements

02:07:32.220 --> 02:07:35.180
that it seems our system is dragging their feet on.

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:37.300
Rank chairs, voting, all that kind of stuff.

02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:38.700
Let's make this clear.

02:07:38.700 --> 02:07:41.380
We claim to be the greatest 21st century democracy

02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:43.300
and we still vote like the 19th century.

02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:45.300
We're not even in the 20th century.

02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:47.180
Most people, when they went to vote,

02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:50.460
they actually checked a box

02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:52.860
and put a piece of paper in a box, right?

02:07:52.860 --> 02:07:55.020
I mean, that's not 21st century.

02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:57.140
We can move millions of dollars,

02:07:57.140 --> 02:08:00.580
maybe billions for you, Lex, in bank accounts

02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:02.420
from our keyboard. Thank you.

02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:04.380
From our keyboards. Billions of rubles.

02:08:05.300 --> 02:08:07.900
Billions of pennies. Pennies.

02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:10.900
Why can we move money safely and not vote in the same way?

02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:12.060
Yeah, and at the same time,

02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:14.780
there's security there in the movement of money

02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:16.700
and then there's the actual engagement.

02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:19.980
Most of us, depending on your age demographic,

02:08:19.980 --> 02:08:23.220
click like on Facebook or Twitter or TikTok

02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:26.740
tens of thousands of times a year.

02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:30.340
I think this kind of mechanism constantly,

02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:32.380
and a like is a vote.

02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:34.100
So you're constantly voting, voting, voting, voting.

02:08:34.100 --> 02:08:37.420
We love voting. We love giving our opinion on that stuff.

02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:40.780
It just seems obvious that gamifying the system,

02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:42.500
which is essentially what the election is,

02:08:42.500 --> 02:08:44.820
making it fun to be engaged in different issues.

02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:46.380
And there's also be a case,

02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:49.260
now I don't understand these things deeply,

02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:52.740
but it always seemed to me that issue-based voting

02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:54.220
should be the future.

02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:57.380
It seems like too complicated to vote for singular people

02:08:57.380 --> 02:09:00.020
versus on ideas, which on Twitter,

02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:02.260
we don't necessarily vote for people.

02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:03.340
We vote for ideas.

02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:06.820
If you like a tweet or not, you like it and so on.

02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:09.340
That too seems to be like a possibility for improvement.

02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:11.180
Well, there's certainly a way to improve polling.

02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.660
We could measure public opinion better.

02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:15.700
We still poll as if we're in the early 20th century.

02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:17.060
They still actually call people.

02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.540
It's amazing to me.

02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:19.860
I was talking to one pollster.

02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:23.100
They will call a hundred people and get one person,

02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:24.340
but they still do that.

02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:26.500
They probably still call landlines, right?

02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.460
Yeah, well, they try to get cell phones too,

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.980
but they do call landlines.

02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:32.380
But one could create a system that would be far better

02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.620
in the way you're describing, it seems to me, Lex,

02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:37.980
to actually assess what people like and don't like.

02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:41.340
So your book, your work in general,

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:45.260
your perspective on history is, I would say,

02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:47.660
at least from my perspective, non-partisan.

02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:48.500
Thank you.

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:51.060
Yeah, you do exceptionally good job with that,

02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:53.180
despite the attacks and the criticisms.

02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.860
That said, you personally, just the way you speak,

02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:57.940
my judgment, and you can push back on this,

02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:00.700
I think you lean left in your politics

02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:01.700
on the political spectrum.

02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:03.180
Maybe you can push back on that.

02:10:03.180 --> 02:10:06.020
Can you make the case for either perspective

02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:08.700
on your own personality as a fan of yours

02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:12.660
that you do lean left or you don't lean left?

02:10:12.660 --> 02:10:14.460
I think it depends on the kinds of issues

02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:15.300
we're talking about.

02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:18.860
I do tend to lean left on the social and cultural issues.

02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:22.300
So I'm a believer, a firm believer.

02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:23.740
I didn't believe this when I was younger.

02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:26.780
I've come to believe that people should choose

02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:29.260
their own lifestyle and that we should get out of the way.

02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:31.780
I'm a believer, deep believer as a father

02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:35.420
of a 20-year-old woman that my 20-year-old daughter

02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:36.700
should have the right to make any choice

02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:38.740
she wants with her body.

02:10:38.740 --> 02:10:42.300
And if she were to get pregnant at a fraternity party

02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:45.700
at college, she should have the right to decide

02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:46.700
whether to have a child or not.

02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:51.060
So on those issues that would code me left of center,

02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:56.060
I'm actually reasonably conservative on fiscal issues.

02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:59.660
I don't think we should spend money we don't have.

02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:01.060
I'm skeptical.

02:11:01.060 --> 02:11:03.180
I've long been skeptical of cryptocurrency

02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:04.020
and things like that.

02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:05.500
Some of your listeners will disagree with me.

02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.940
This part is part of my own ignorance of cryptocurrency.

02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:10.140
But I'm conservative, lowercase C

02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:11.780
in the way I think about fiscal issues.

02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:13.540
I worry about debt.

02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:16.220
I'm a believer that there are certain areas

02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:18.860
where the federal government should play more of a role

02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:20.820
and there are other areas where things should be left

02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:21.900
to the localities.

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:24.820
And so sometimes that can code me one way or another.

02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:26.940
But I think I sound sometimes a little more left of center

02:11:26.940 --> 02:11:28.860
because on the social issues, that definitely.

02:11:28.860 --> 02:11:31.260
Well, there's other explanations

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:32.820
not to be grilling you too hard here.

02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:34.100
No, it's fair.

02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:37.460
Because you're also an exceptionally respected

02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:40.180
and successful professor in the university system

02:11:40.180 --> 02:11:44.540
where sometimes there is a lean towards the left.

02:11:44.540 --> 02:11:47.540
And the other aspect is I think your viewpoints on Trump

02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:52.780
where you're a strong critic of Donald Trump.

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:55.060
And I guess the question I want to ask is

02:11:55.060 --> 02:11:57.380
you as a historian, does that color

02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:59.740
your perspective of history?

02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:05.700
Do you ever catch yourself where maybe your criticism

02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:09.780
of Donald Trump might affect how you see the Civil War?

02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:12.500
Like as you were completely diving in

02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:14.580
and looking at the Civil War,

02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:18.060
are you able to put aside your sort of

02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:20.540
the current day political viewpoints?

02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:21.380
No, I'm not.

02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:24.500
I think we have to be honest that none of us are objective.

02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:25.980
We strive to be nonpartisan.

02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:27.420
I really liked when you said that

02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:29.660
because I think it's an aspiration.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:31.620
No one is objective.

02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:33.580
We all have our biases.

02:12:33.580 --> 02:12:36.180
Some people like chocolate, some like vanilla.

02:12:36.180 --> 02:12:38.140
And it's just, that's just the reality, right?

02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:40.740
And as far as I know, there's really hard,

02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:43.460
it's very hard even to biologically explain that.

02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:48.300
And so my view is that what a good historian,

02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:50.660
what a good scholar does, I don't care what the field is,

02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:53.100
is you're self-conscious of your biases

02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:57.660
and you try to recognize them

02:12:57.660 --> 02:12:59.780
as you're doing your research.

02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.660
And you make doubly certain

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:04.780
that where your research seems to reinforce your biases,

02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:07.980
that you actually have the evidence to make that argument.

02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:10.220
But I still believe even doing that,

02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:12.260
that someone with a slightly different perspective

02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:14.620
might read the same evidence in different ways.

02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:16.660
That's what makes history vibrant.

02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:20.540
So I wrote this book in part, as I say in the introduction,

02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:23.340
because I was self-critical watching Trump

02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:26.780
and the things I quite frankly find deeply dangerous

02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:29.900
about Donald Trump and about what happened on January 6th.

02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:32.780
And I found I had not thought deeply enough

02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:35.380
about the roots of that in our society.

02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:37.380
Because I don't believe Trump or any one figure

02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:38.820
creates these kinds of movements,

02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:40.820
they come out of a deeper history.

02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:43.100
Just a small side tangent,

02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:46.580
I do believe your work is non-partisan,

02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:50.180
but it's also funny that there are a lot of people

02:13:50.180 --> 02:13:51.580
on the right that would read your work

02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.300
and say that you're partisan.

02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:56.180
And I think the reason that can happen sometimes,

02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:57.340
not strongly though,

02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:59.580
I think you do a really good job,

02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:02.460
is the use of certain words also.

02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.620
I try to be cognizant of that.

02:14:05.620 --> 02:14:10.620
I try not to use words that trigger people's tribalism.

02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:12.620
It's kind of interesting.

02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:14.060
So you have to be also aware of that,

02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:15.300
maybe when you're writing history,

02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:16.620
when you're writing in general,

02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:18.940
is if you're interested in remaining,

02:14:18.940 --> 02:14:20.860
you can put on different hats.

02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.100
You can be carefree in just stating your opinion

02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:28.060
of criticizing Donald Trump or Joe Biden,

02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:30.260
or you can be non-partisan deliberately.

02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:32.340
And that takes skill, probably,

02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:33.940
and avoiding certain triggering words.

02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:36.700
And to me, it's about choosing your battles.

02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:40.540
So I try to write, because I want everyone to read them.

02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:42.700
I actually think people on the left and right

02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:43.780
have a lot to learn from this history.

02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:45.780
As so many people have said to me around the country,

02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:47.820
this is history I wish I had known before.

02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:51.500
But there are moments when I use words

02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:52.460
that I know are controversial

02:14:52.460 --> 02:14:54.060
because I'm trying to show there's a fact

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.860
that there's a space behind them.

02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:59.140
So white supremacy does exist.

02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:00.980
I've had people say, I don't think that's,

02:15:00.980 --> 02:15:03.140
I think that's a politically correct term,

02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:04.900
or it's a woke term.

02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:06.660
It can be used in the wrong ways.

02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:08.420
One should not go around calling everything

02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:09.860
one doesn't like that.

02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:13.340
But the Confederates were white supremacists.

02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:14.820
And I use that word,

02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:16.860
because I think it's an accurate descriptor,

02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:20.380
and we need to recognize that that is a part of our history.

02:15:20.380 --> 02:15:22.020
But that does trigger some people.

02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:25.340
That language is used to mean other things currently.

02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:27.580
So the press will take on certain terms

02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:28.500
like white supremacists

02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:30.500
and label everybody white supremacist.

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:33.460
Like a lot of people that basically are in the right

02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:34.300
or something like that,

02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:36.860
they use this outraged language

02:15:36.860 --> 02:15:38.500
and that actually ruins the ability

02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:40.860
to use the language precisely.

02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:41.700
Exactly.

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:42.540
For historical context.

02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:43.380
That's exactly right.

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:44.220
That's exactly right.

02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:46.660
But you do have to, unfortunately we do have to,

02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:47.780
no, actually people disagree.

02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:49.140
You might disagree with this.

02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:51.980
But I tend to try to avoid,

02:15:51.980 --> 02:15:55.540
like take on the responsibility of avoiding that language.

02:15:55.540 --> 02:15:57.500
Like if the press is using a certain kind of language,

02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:58.660
I try to avoid it.

02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:01.220
Yeah, what I try to do is sometimes avoid it,

02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:02.740
but where I think the language is necessary.

02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:03.580
Precise, yeah.

02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:05.740
To be precise, but also to contextualize.

02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:11.420
So I don't call all Confederates white supremacists,

02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:13.900
but I point out where white supremacist ideas

02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:16.860
have influenced them, right?

02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:18.500
And I point out where certain individuals

02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:20.420
are doing things that resonate with that.

02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:24.380
But I'm against these kind of blanket labels and categories.

02:16:24.380 --> 02:16:28.780
And you also have to speak about white supremacism

02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:31.060
in that context in a nuanced way.

02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:32.420
So people use white supremacist

02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:33.700
without thinking what that means

02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:35.500
and they just use it as a slow word,

02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:37.540
like this evil person. Correct.

02:16:37.540 --> 02:16:40.180
But white supremacist is also just an ideology

02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:41.980
that a lot of people have believed throughout.

02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:45.220
Supremacy, whatever, white, black supremacy,

02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:46.420
whatever supremacy.

02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:48.900
Believing that some people are better than others.

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:50.740
Some group is better than another.

02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:54.220
And there've been nations built around these kinds of ideas.

02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:57.060
And a lot of human history is built around those ideas.

02:16:57.060 --> 02:16:59.700
It's not just evil people believe in this.

02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:01.340
We in the United States of America

02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:04.420
believe this kind of ideology is not productive.

02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:06.380
It's unethical.

02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:09.260
But those ideas have been held by a lot of people

02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:11.180
and not like fringe groups.

02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:12.020
Right.

02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:14.540
But majorities of nations.

02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:17.300
I'd say the same about anti-Semitism.

02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:20.500
And there are many people who are not anti-Semites

02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:23.380
but don't recognize that they're carrying around

02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:27.100
or promoting anti-Semitic ideas or anti-Semitic myths.

02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:29.140
It's a thought that's been held by a lot of people

02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:30.980
and you need to be convinced out of it

02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:36.140
that that requires conversation and being empathetic.

02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:38.620
It's not just calling somebody anti-Semite

02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:41.660
and you're evil because you've ever said something

02:17:41.660 --> 02:17:44.620
that's kind of a dog whistle against Jewish people.

02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:46.380
You have to be open-hearted to that.

02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:48.140
These are ideas that you have to contend with it

02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:52.700
that you have to ultimately, I think,

02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:54.860
heal the division behind those ideas

02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:57.660
by having empathetic conversations with people

02:17:57.660 --> 02:18:00.220
as opposed to, again, throwing poop.

02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:02.260
I just like saying poop.

02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:03.340
All right.

02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:05.660
Ooh, I got a challenge for you.

02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:10.660
Given that you have been an outspoken critic of Donald Trump,

02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:13.020
can you say one thing you like

02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:16.140
and one thing you don't like about Donald Trump?

02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:19.860
And perhaps can you do the same for our current president,

02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:22.420
Joe Biden, one thing you like and one thing you dislike?

02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:24.460
So it's harder for me to do the one thing I dislike

02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:26.460
because there's so many things I dislike.

02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:31.140
But the one thing I like about Donald Trump,

02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:38.300
he believes that America should be a better country.

02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:41.140
I disagree on what he thinks it should be,

02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:42.860
but he's not a declineist.

02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:45.300
He's someone who believes the world could be made better.

02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:46.660
I disagree with what he's trying to do.

02:18:46.660 --> 02:18:48.340
I disagree with how he's trying to do it.

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.340
But I like the fact that he thinks it can be better.

02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:51.540
His whole argument for himself

02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:53.100
is that he can make things better.

02:18:53.100 --> 02:18:54.420
I don't think he can,

02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:55.780
but I think things can be made better.

02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:57.380
So I like the second half of that sentence

02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:59.460
when he says, I can make things better.

02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:00.300
Take the eye out.

02:19:00.300 --> 02:19:01.300
I like the can be better

02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:04.380
because there are too many people on the left and the right

02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:07.660
who think that we can't make things better

02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:08.860
that we can't make things better.

02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:12.260
We have to accept them as they are or they're getting worse.

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:14.340
I think a world without hope is horrible.

02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:16.780
And I think what he has offered his followers

02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:17.820
is a kind of hope.

02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:23.620
So underneath his message is a kind of optimism

02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:24.620
for the future of this nation.

02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:26.580
It's a narcissistic optimism, but it's still an optimism.

02:19:26.580 --> 02:19:31.580
Yes, that he's promising that if you elect him again,

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:34.500
he will make things better.

02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:36.660
And I think people need to be told

02:19:36.660 --> 02:19:38.620
that we need to believe that we can make things better.

02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:39.580
So that part I accept,

02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:43.420
and I reject those who say we can't make things better.

02:19:43.420 --> 02:19:44.860
My whole historical career is about showing

02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:48.020
that history gives us tools to make things better.

02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:51.700
So I like the idea of trying to make things better

02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:54.060
and giving people hope and reason to believe

02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:55.220
that things can be better.

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:58.060
What's the main thing you dislike about Donald Trump?

02:19:58.060 --> 02:20:03.060
I think he has no concern or care for the welfare

02:20:03.980 --> 02:20:06.140
of anyone other than himself.

02:20:06.140 --> 02:20:09.300
So do you mean on a basic human psychology perspective?

02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:13.860
And I think he doesn't even care about his children.

02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:16.620
I think he's just, I think it's him.

02:20:16.620 --> 02:20:18.100
I think he's gone into a rabbit hole.

02:20:18.100 --> 02:20:19.740
He might not always have been this way.

02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:21.420
I did watch him a long time in New York City

02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:23.420
when I was growing up in New York,

02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:24.860
and I think he's been in this path.

02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:26.300
And I think it's an extreme,

02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:28.300
it's a clinical kind of narcissism.

02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:31.260
So to you, when you analyze presidents

02:20:31.260 --> 02:20:32.900
and you've written about presidents,

02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:35.020
you don't just look at policies and so on,

02:20:35.020 --> 02:20:35.860
you look at the human being.

02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:37.420
Now, of course you have to.

02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:38.540
Leadership is about human being.

02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:40.660
Policy matters, it's one part of the equation,

02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:42.220
but it's not the only part.

02:20:42.220 --> 02:20:44.340
What about Joe Biden?

02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:45.900
What do you like and what do you dislike about him?

02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:49.980
So what I like about Joe Biden is in contrast to Trump,

02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:53.180
I think Joe Biden really right now in his career

02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:56.060
sees his role as the shepherd of democracy.

02:20:56.060 --> 02:20:58.580
He really believes that it's his role as president

02:20:58.580 --> 02:21:02.660
to make our democracy more stable and more vibrant.

02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:03.980
I think he really believes,

02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:06.580
I think that's why he's doing what he's doing right now.

02:21:06.580 --> 02:21:09.620
And he comes from that system, the political system,

02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:12.780
that basically the process of democracy,

02:21:12.780 --> 02:21:14.300
he's worked there for many decades.

02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:15.140
It's all he's done.

02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:16.740
Yeah, that's all he knows

02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:19.700
and he wants that to propagate for better and for worse.

02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:21.780
And he's not an extreme democratic partisan at all.

02:21:21.780 --> 02:21:24.420
He's actually a pretty middle of the road guy

02:21:24.420 --> 02:21:25.780
on most issues.

02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:27.180
Some people don't like him for that,

02:21:27.180 --> 02:21:30.620
but I think he is about democracy.

02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:32.700
What do I dislike about Biden?

02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:37.740
I think he does not have the capacity right now

02:21:37.900 --> 02:21:42.900
to provide the language and the public discussion

02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:45.100
of where our country should go.

02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:48.940
He doesn't have a language to inspire

02:21:48.940 --> 02:21:53.940
and build enthusiasm for the future.

02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:55.980
That'll probably be one of my,

02:21:55.980 --> 02:21:58.220
I mean, cause I'm a sucker for great speeches.

02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:01.860
And so for me, that's definitely a thing that stands out

02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:04.940
for several reasons, one in a time,

02:22:04.940 --> 02:22:06.860
because we've been facing so many challenges

02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:08.620
like the pandemic.

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:13.620
It just seems like, to me it seems like an easy like layup.

02:22:14.660 --> 02:22:17.140
There's so many troubles we're going through

02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:19.580
that just require a great unifying president

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:23.740
or the great, like just if I were to speak candidly

02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:27.700
about kind of the speaking ability of Obama, for example,

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:30.380
Obama would just destroy this right now,

02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:33.620
both on the war in Ukraine, on the pandemic,

02:22:33.620 --> 02:22:37.300
all of it, there's a hunger for unification, I believe.

02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:38.860
Maybe people disagree with that

02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:42.380
cause I think people have become cynical

02:22:42.380 --> 02:22:44.380
in that the divisions that we're experiencing

02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:47.220
are kind of already really baked in.

02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:50.020
They're really planted their feet, but I don't think so.

02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:51.500
I think there's a huge hunger,

02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:54.420
maybe a little bit of a quiet hunger for a unifier,

02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:55.860
for a great unifier.

02:22:55.860 --> 02:22:56.700
I agree, I agree.

02:22:56.700 --> 02:22:58.540
And I think what a great speech does

02:22:58.540 --> 02:23:01.700
is it's like a great piece of music or poetry.

02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:03.860
It helps you see something in yourself

02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:06.380
and feel something you didn't feel before.

02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:07.780
It doesn't overcome all different.

02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:09.900
I don't think that speeches are unifying,

02:23:09.900 --> 02:23:12.060
but I think what they are is they're mobilizing

02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:14.940
and you can mobilize people to the same mission

02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:16.460
with different points of view.

02:23:19.580 --> 02:23:21.580
Do you think Trump derangement syndrome

02:23:21.580 --> 02:23:23.660
is a medical condition?

02:23:23.660 --> 02:23:26.940
Also, is there such thing as Biden derangement syndrome?

02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:31.420
What I mean by that, it's a funny kind of question,

02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:34.980
but why are people so deeply outraged,

02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:39.140
seemingly beyond reason, at their hatred

02:23:39.140 --> 02:23:42.300
or support of Donald Trump, but hatred in particular?

02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:46.340
I've seen a lot of friends and people I respect

02:23:46.340 --> 02:23:47.740
lose their mind completely.

02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:49.140
Yeah, yeah.

02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:51.380
So I'm not sure it's a medical condition or not

02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:53.740
because I'm not a medical doctor.

02:23:53.740 --> 02:23:56.580
So as my kids say, I'm the wrong kind of doctor.

02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:59.140
I'm a doctor, so let me take you over from here.

02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:02.180
No, the fact that you get the doctor's sign

02:24:02.180 --> 02:24:04.860
after getting a PhD is a ridiculous hilarity to me.

02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:05.860
Hilarious, ridiculous.

02:24:05.860 --> 02:24:08.180
So as the wrong kind of doctor, I'll say,

02:24:08.180 --> 02:24:10.180
I'm not gonna comment on whether it's a medical condition,

02:24:10.180 --> 02:24:11.980
but I do think you're onto something.

02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:17.860
I think there is a way in which these men

02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:22.020
become touchstones of anger.

02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:26.220
And there's all kinds of anger and anxiety that people have.

02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:28.700
And I've seen this in other historical periods.

02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:31.780
You center it on one person.

02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:36.100
In a way, that's John Wilkes Booth and Lincoln.

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:38.660
He actually didn't have a personal beef with Lincoln.

02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:41.180
It was that all the things he feared

02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:44.300
were manifest in that.

02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:46.780
And I think that's an old story,

02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:49.380
and then it's made worse by social media

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:50.900
and the way we're bombarded.

02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:53.780
And it's like, it becomes a drug.

02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:56.540
I mean, there are people I know who hate Trump or Biden

02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:58.900
so much and just watch them.

02:24:58.900 --> 02:24:59.900
It's not that they don't watch them.

02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:01.060
It's that they do watch them, right?

02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:02.980
And it's just sort of, and it triggers you

02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:05.700
and you get hateful and then you feel

02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:08.420
like you've done something by shouting out your hate

02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:09.900
or typing in.

02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:11.980
And so I don't know if it's a derangement syndrome.

02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:15.780
I think it's a way in which our energy gets channeled

02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:18.900
and expressed in totally useless ways.

02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:19.820
Yeah.

02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:21.860
That's the interesting psychology, which reminds me,

02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:24.300
I need to explore that because I've noticed that,

02:25:24.300 --> 02:25:26.900
believe it or not, it's easy for me to believe,

02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:29.380
but there's people watching this right now

02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:31.300
who really hate me.

02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:33.140
And they're watching because they hate me.

02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:35.700
They hate the way I look, the way I speak,

02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:39.340
the mumbling, all of that, and they're still watching.

02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:44.260
And I'd like to say that, as I nervously try

02:25:44.260 --> 02:25:46.260
to explain myself, I'd like to say

02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:47.740
that that's not a productive way.

02:25:47.740 --> 02:25:48.560
I get it.

02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:51.160
I understand.

02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:54.960
There's a kind of, what is it?

02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:57.000
Is it the same psychological effect

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.880
when you see a car crash and you keep staring?

02:25:58.880 --> 02:25:59.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:00.720
It's some kind of thing that pulls you in.

02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:01.560
Totally.

02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:04.320
But I feel like it's that feeling,

02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:06.040
this is probably slightly different,

02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:09.760
but you kind of want to maybe feel something

02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.200
and there's an anger in you already,

02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:13.840
frustrations from day to day life, life is hard,

02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:16.280
and you just want to channel that anger towards something.

02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:18.480
But the internet really makes that easy

02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:20.200
for some reason.

02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:21.440
And it makes sense of your life, that's the problem.

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:23.720
For people whose lives are chaos,

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:26.880
hating you and blaming you gives order to their lives.

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:29.240
Yeah, if it makes you happy, please continue.

02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:32.800
I'm curious, it seems to bother you though, doesn't it?

02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.760
Yeah, hate of any kind, not towards me,

02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:37.160
just the people, because I think about them

02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:39.680
and I tend to think that most people

02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:42.000
are amazing human beings and have a capacity

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:43.560
to do great things in this world.

02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:47.720
And so I just think that's not a productive way of being.

02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:50.720
Psychologically, for anything whatsoever,

02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:52.840
everybody has quirks that you can hate,

02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:54.880
but you just focus on the really positive stuff

02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:56.720
and you celebrate that stuff and that feels good,

02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:59.120
that has a momentum to it.

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:01.240
I guess the hate has a momentum to it too,

02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:02.800
and that's what I'm trying to highlight.

02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:04.680
If you follow the momentum of hate,

02:27:04.680 --> 02:27:07.640
that's going to maybe feel good in the short term,

02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:11.160
but it's gonna fuck you over more and more in your life.

02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:12.960
And you have to be cognizant of that

02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:14.000
as you interact with the internet.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:15.160
I agree with everything you said,

02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:18.800
but I think people who do things

02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:21.080
that are influential and serious,

02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:23.280
there always are some people who hate them.

02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:25.760
I suppose that, but I wanted to show the difference

02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:30.080
between philosophical disagreement that borders on hate

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:33.320
and what's called hate watching,

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:36.520
where you just, which is what I would say TDS is,

02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:40.920
which is you're almost enjoying how much you hate this person,

02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:42.760
you're sitting in their hate and you forgot,

02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:45.040
you lose all reason, you lose everything,

02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:47.280
your capacity to think as an individual,

02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:50.160
to empathize with others, you lose all of that.

02:27:50.160 --> 02:27:52.800
You're in this muck of hate,

02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:56.240
and somehow it helps you make sense

02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:58.760
of this particular difficult moment in your life,

02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:02.720
but otherwise it just seems like a shitty way to live.

02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:05.200
But disagreement, definitely, I like disagreement.

02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:06.440
But I guess what I'm saying is,

02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:08.960
and I think this is your message too, right,

02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:12.920
is that don't let the fact that people don't like you

02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:14.200
or even that some people hate you

02:28:14.200 --> 02:28:16.080
stop you from doing the right thing.

02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:18.880
Think about how you can perhaps trigger them less,

02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:20.200
but don't stop what you're doing.

02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:22.960
I see too many, and this is why I bring this up,

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.320
too many of my students,

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.840
too many young, very talented people

02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:29.520
who are afraid to take risks

02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:31.920
because they're afraid that someone will hate them.

02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:33.960
And that can't get in your way.

02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:36.440
The reality is most people,

02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:38.600
or there will always be at least one person

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:42.920
that will have your back and that will support you,

02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:44.480
and just focus on them.

02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:46.240
As long as you're doing the right thing,

02:28:46.240 --> 02:28:48.200
focus on them for the strength.

02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:50.880
But in general, I'm exaggerating here

02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:52.440
because most of the time,

02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:55.240
99% of people are supportive on the internet.

02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:58.440
It's just that something about the human psychology

02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:00.760
really stands out to you when somebody criticizes.

02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:02.280
Well, it's easy on the internet.

02:29:02.280 --> 02:29:03.360
This is historically different

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:05.640
from where we were before in a society.

02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:08.080
It's very easy now to say hurtful things to people

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:09.840
and not have to even deal with them

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.200
looking at you in the face.

02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:14.200
One of the things that encourages politeness

02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:16.720
is the fact that we're looking at one another.

02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:19.560
And we are naturally programmed

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:23.960
not to want the other person to react to us in certain ways.

02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:26.120
But when we don't see their face,

02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:28.320
it's very easy to say all kinds of things.

02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:30.360
Let me actually comment on that point.

02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:32.000
There's a lot of people on the internet

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.040
that say that I don't sort of push back on points

02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:38.840
or criticize people or ask the hard questions enough.

02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:41.040
First of all, oftentimes I disagree with that.

02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:45.120
But also, I don't think you guys realize

02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:46.360
how hard that is to do

02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:48.360
when you're sitting with a person.

02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:49.560
I don't care about access.

02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:51.000
I don't care about them being famous.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:52.320
Just on a basic human level,

02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:55.600
it's really hard to ask a hard question

02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:56.440
from a place of empathy.

02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:57.320
Except when I'm sitting here,

02:29:57.320 --> 02:29:58.480
you seem to be able to ask me hard.

02:29:58.480 --> 02:29:59.840
No, this is a super fun,

02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:01.280
I mean, when there's brilliant people like you

02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:03.960
where there's nothing to push back on, that's easy.

02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:07.760
But there's a basic human thing that doesn't,

02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:09.560
I think it's almost easier to be a journalist.

02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:11.000
Journalists do this well

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.680
where they don't have empathy for the person.

02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:16.080
They're just asking the hard questions.

02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:19.440
So where were you at this time last night?

02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:20.960
Because that's very suspicious.

02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:22.920
It's in contradiction to what you said,

02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:24.720
and they're just doing factual stuff.

02:30:24.720 --> 02:30:27.560
And if you actually truly have a conversation

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:29.080
with another human being you empathize,

02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:31.280
it's very difficult.

02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.600
Because they have a story.

02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:34.720
They have a vision of themselves

02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:36.080
that they're the good person.

02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:40.120
And to call somebody a liar while having empathy,

02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:41.680
basically imply that they're a liar,

02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:43.960
that's damn, damn hard.

02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:48.960
So anyway, I'm trying to figure this thing out.

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:49.960
Can you make the case

02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:52.880
that the January 6th storming of the US Capitol

02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:54.160
is a big deal?

02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:57.520
And can you make the case that it is not a big deal?

02:30:57.520 --> 02:31:00.320
I think the case is overwhelming that it was a big deal.

02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:01.640
And I opened the book with this

02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:04.080
before going back to the end of the Civil War,

02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:06.480
because I think it echoes that moment.

02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:11.480
You had a group of people who literally tried to stop

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:16.760
the peaceful transfer of power and were intending,

02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:19.280
and there's overwhelming evidence of this,

02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:21.600
if they had caught the vice president

02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:25.520
or the speaker of the house to do bodily harm to them

02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:27.480
or to kidnap them.

02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:29.200
So this was a coup d'etat.

02:31:29.200 --> 02:31:30.440
That is the definition of a coup d'etat

02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:33.440
when you try to capture and prevent elected officials

02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:34.720
from doing their job.

02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:35.960
That's a huge deal.

02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:38.920
That had happened before in our country, in states,

02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:41.280
and I talk about this in Louisiana, in Tennessee,

02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:43.240
and places like that after the Civil War,

02:31:43.240 --> 02:31:44.640
but it never happened in the Capitol.

02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:45.720
That's a huge deal.

02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:47.760
That is, if I might say, that's like third,

02:31:47.760 --> 02:31:50.200
what we would think of as third world behavior

02:31:50.200 --> 02:31:51.040
in our society,

02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:52.960
and no offense to those from other parts of the world.

02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:53.920
I'm just trying to make a point

02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:56.720
is how we see that is happening somewhere else, not here.

02:31:56.720 --> 02:31:57.960
That's a big fucking deal.

02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:01.560
The case that is not a big deal,

02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:03.040
I guess the case to make there is

02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:04.720
that they didn't succeed.

02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:06.120
The case that is not a big deal

02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:08.000
is not that their intentions were not bad.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.120
I don't see how you can defend their intentions.

02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:13.280
The case that is not a big deal

02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:15.480
is they were a bunch of clowns.

02:32:15.480 --> 02:32:19.040
And yeah, they broke in, but in the end,

02:32:19.040 --> 02:32:20.360
once they got in there, they didn't know what to do,

02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:21.840
which is true.

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:26.080
And so, I think a professional coup plotter

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:28.200
would say these were the amateurs

02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:30.400
and that they had no real chance of succeeding

02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:32.960
because once they got into the Capitol,

02:32:33.880 --> 02:32:34.720
they had no plan what to do next.

02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:35.560
What are they gonna do?

02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:39.200
You know, steal Stapler from Nancy Pelosi's office.

02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:40.320
They didn't seem to have a plan,

02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:41.360
and then what ended up happening,

02:32:41.360 --> 02:32:43.520
they left the building.

02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:46.360
Well, that would be the case that it's not a big deal

02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:50.240
because their intention was not to overthrow.

02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:52.560
Their intention was to protest

02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:54.200
because if the intention was to overthrow,

02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:55.240
it would be much more organized.

02:32:55.240 --> 02:32:56.920
I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming

02:32:56.920 --> 02:32:58.240
that they intended to stop.

02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:00.880
They were there to stop the certification of the election.

02:33:00.880 --> 02:33:03.080
They were there to prevent Donald Trump

02:33:03.080 --> 02:33:04.720
from having to leave office.

02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:06.360
They just didn't have a good plan.

02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:08.760
This was the keystone cops.

02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:10.840
So you're saying there is some,

02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:12.920
like statistically some possibility

02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:15.480
that this would have succeeded

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:17.840
at halting the basic process of democracy.

02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:19.440
You could imagine a scenario where it might have

02:33:19.440 --> 02:33:20.320
if they had gotten lucky.

02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:23.560
Sure, if they had caught the vice president.

02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:25.960
But what could have, if they caught the vice president.

02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:27.360
They couldn't go on and certify then.

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:28.200
He has to be there.

02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:30.160
No, but don't you think that would resolve itself

02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:32.120
to police action and so on?

02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:36.520
My question is how much is this individual hooligans

02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:39.240
and how much of this is a gigantic movement

02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:41.680
that's challenging the very fabric of our democracy?

02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:43.440
Well, it's not a gigantic movement,

02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:45.200
but it was a small coup d'etat

02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:47.320
that could have actually made the transition

02:33:47.320 --> 02:33:48.160
much more difficult.

02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:49.280
Was there a scenario where Donald Trump

02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:50.760
stayed in office legitimately?

02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:52.600
No, but was there a scenario

02:33:52.600 --> 02:33:54.920
where they created a great deal of chaos

02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:56.720
that further undermine our democracy?

02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:57.560
Actually, yes.

02:33:57.560 --> 02:33:58.880
Here's how it would happen, right?

02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:00.800
They capture Pence, right?

02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:03.160
They either kidnap him and try to ransom him,

02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:05.920
or they, which is what they were trying to do

02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:08.320
with the Michigan governor, Governor Whitmer,

02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:09.760
or they kill him.

02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:11.120
And then Donald Trump says,

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:12.440
okay, well, there's no vice president,

02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:14.000
so you can't certify.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.240
The Senate would choose someone else to be vice president,

02:34:16.240 --> 02:34:18.080
but Donald Trump says, no, that's not legitimate.

02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:18.920
Do you think it's possible

02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:20.400
that Donald Trump would say something like that?

02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:22.080
Absolutely.

02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:22.920
I disagree with you.

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:26.800
He said that morning that Pence should not certify.

02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:27.880
He said that morning.

02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:30.640
But there's a difference between sort of Twitter rhetoric.

02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:32.120
No, no, he said it at a rally.

02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:33.880
Sure, rally rhetoric.

02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:36.040
And there is a threshold.

02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:37.480
It feels like a big leap.

02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:40.360
He asked people around him in the Oval Office

02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:41.440
how he could make that happen.

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:44.560
He tried to get a new person appointed attorney general

02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:45.600
who would do that.

02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:48.400
He tried to find legal justification for it.

02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:51.400
I think the evidence is overwhelming

02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:53.760
that Trump was supportive of efforts

02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:57.200
after the election didn't go the way he wanted

02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:59.080
to keep him in office.

02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:02.480
And whether that's legally actionable

02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:05.360
and whether one thinks that means he's a bad president

02:35:05.360 --> 02:35:09.920
or not is a matter of opinion, but facts are facts.

02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:11.600
Yeah, I just wonder if it's possible

02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:14.560
for him to have state president in this kind of context.

02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:15.400
No.

02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:16.400
It seems like a heated, just like you said,

02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:19.080
elections can even be violent.

02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:20.200
They're heated.

02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:22.040
People are very upset.

02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:25.400
When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016,

02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:27.240
I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:30.160
The amount of anger,

02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:35.720
I was just getting the energy I was getting from people.

02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:39.880
I mean, if there was any way to channel that anger,

02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:41.320
I think people would be in trouble.

02:35:41.320 --> 02:35:42.640
There's anger.

02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:43.560
Yeah, I agree with that.

02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:44.400
And that is right.

02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:47.840
And elections are violent, as I said, but this is different.

02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:51.960
This is the person in the office of the presidency

02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:54.240
using the power of the presidency

02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:58.040
to try to stay in office, to imperil people's lives,

02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:02.000
to distort our government on a scale we had not seen before.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.080
And these are not opinions of mine.

02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:05.920
We have the documentary evidence.

02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:08.360
We have the testimony from people about this.

02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:10.160
We can differ over what you think

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.280
of his presidency as a whole.

02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:13.720
We can differ over whether you think

02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:15.280
he should be held legally responsible.

02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:16.800
Those are matters of opinion.

02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:21.800
But the facts are he sat on January 6th, watched it on TV,

02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:25.520
did not send ever, ever,

02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:27.880
did he ever send any protection for Congress?

02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:28.800
That is his job.

02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:32.600
And throughout asked, continued to ask

02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.320
how this certification could be prevented.

02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:39.000
To you, that's not incompetence, that's malevolence.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:39.840
Absolutely.

02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:44.400
If I watch my children getting harmed

02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:47.280
and I don't do something about it, I'm watching it.

02:36:47.280 --> 02:36:50.920
And in fact, I take action that tries to help

02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:53.120
those who are doing the harm.

02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:54.760
You would not just say I'm an incompetent president.

02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:57.000
You would, a parent, you would say I was a negligent parent

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.800
and you'd call parental support to take away my children.

02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:03.360
I was troubled by the way the press covered it,

02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:05.720
that they politicized the crap out of that.

02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:10.880
And not just the press, but also Congress itself.

02:37:10.880 --> 02:37:13.320
It just seemed like impeachment and all of this.

02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:15.320
There just seemed to be a kind of circus

02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:20.320
that wasn't interested in democracy or non-partisanship.

02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:24.440
I don't, so it's very difficult for me

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:27.560
to see the situation with clear eyes

02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:29.640
because it's been colored by the press.

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:32.440
It's very difficult for me to know what is even true.

02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:35.560
Members of Congress, including our members of Congress

02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:38.040
from our district and others, right?

02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:40.360
Their lives were threatened.

02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:41.680
They were traumatized.

02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:44.120
I have a lot of students,

02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:46.920
at least a dozen who are staff members,

02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:48.600
more than half are Republicans.

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:53.920
Part of what traumatized them was that the president

02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:56.040
did not do his job to protect them.

02:37:56.040 --> 02:37:58.440
Yes, as a child would be traumatized,

02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:00.840
not only if harmed by someone,

02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:03.280
but if mom and dad don't do everything they can.

02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:04.800
One of the things that makes people feel safe

02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:05.800
is they know their parents,

02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:07.600
they know their person and authority

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:08.640
can't always keep them safe,

02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:10.520
but they wanna know the person's always trying.

02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:12.160
I agree with you that there, listen,

02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:16.360
I'm somebody that believes in this kind of idea of family,

02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:17.840
especially with people I work with,

02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:20.560
that to me is a high ideal to protect,

02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:22.400
but that's a little bit different.

02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:23.240
It's his job.

02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:24.080
Hold on a second.

02:38:24.080 --> 02:38:26.520
That's a little bit different than protecting democracy.

02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:27.840
Those are two different things.

02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:30.040
Protecting your employees

02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:32.400
and protecting democracy is an ideal.

02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:34.880
You could say he didn't protect either,

02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:36.600
but I think the criticism

02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:38.320
that he didn't protect the employees is one thing.

02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:40.080
But the employees in this case

02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:42.080
are the ones carrying out democracy.

02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:43.560
So it's like saying the general

02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:45.640
who doesn't protect his soldiers

02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:47.120
is maybe not protecting his employees.

02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:49.600
Those who are not protecting the war effort, right?

02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:51.560
It is his, the people we're talking about

02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:53.640
are the people who are actually doing the work of democracy

02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:56.000
at that moment, the most basic function of democracy,

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.200
which is certifying votes.

02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:00.520
And their lives with, I'm telling you,

02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:04.280
I had students, one who works for Senator Romney,

02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:08.080
for example, who spent hours in a closet,

02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:11.640
hearing people outside, looking on her phone,

02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:14.640
when is the president sending people to protect us

02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:15.880
so we can do our job?

02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:17.880
And she was not happy with the way the election turned out,

02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:19.760
but she was there to do her job

02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:21.760
because she believes in democracy,

02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:23.560
to serve as the Senate in the Senate's role.

02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:25.480
What should have Donald Trump done

02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:27.480
without turning him into a different human being?

02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:28.920
He should have immediately,

02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:32.360
just as we were watching things get breached,

02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:34.520
the moment that the members of the House and the Senate

02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:37.880
had to evacuate their respective chambers,

02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:40.960
he should have immediately gone on TV and Twitter

02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:45.280
in every space he could and tell his supporters to leave

02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:47.440
and say what he never said.

02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:49.320
This is un-American what you're doing.

02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:50.360
This is unacceptable.

02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:51.200
Never use those words.

02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:52.800
This is un-American, this is unacceptable.

02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:55.760
I am completely against anyone storming the Capitol

02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:57.880
like this, go home now, please.

02:39:57.880 --> 02:40:00.040
Or you can use his own language, but tell him to leave.

02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:03.960
Yeah, and immediately, we know he was watching for hours,

02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:06.800
and we have testimony from his own daughter, from Ivanka,

02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:08.440
saying she tried time and again

02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:10.920
to get him to say something earlier on, and he didn't.

02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:12.640
He watched it.

02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:15.800
He can still criticize all the politicians.

02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:17.080
He can criticize everyone he wants,

02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:18.080
but he should have told them to leave.

02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:20.840
All he used to do in that moment is basic,

02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:24.160
a protecting democracy, protecting the Capitol, leave.

02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:25.800
Tell them to leave and do everything he can

02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:27.240
to find any kind of force he can give

02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:28.880
to go protect the Capitol.

02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:31.800
I wonder how difficult it is

02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:33.840
to lose a presidential election.

02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:36.360
It's happened so many times.

02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:37.920
I understand that, but it's,

02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:41.360
especially when like, what is it,

02:40:41.360 --> 02:40:44.040
you know, 80 million people vote for you,

02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:46.680
or like some, like millions and millions and millions

02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:47.520
of people vote for you.

02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:48.720
It's crazy.

02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:49.560
It's crazy.

02:40:49.560 --> 02:40:50.880
This democracy thing is crazy.

02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:55.320
George H.W. Bush won a war in the Middle East, right?

02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:56.960
He had 90% approval rating,

02:40:56.960 --> 02:40:58.920
and then a year later lost the election.

02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:00.880
To someone, Bill Clinton, he thought,

02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:02.480
had none of the experience he had,

02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:06.520
someone he believed didn't have the right moral character,

02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:08.840
and Bush did everything he could

02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:10.600
to help the next president get started well,

02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:12.720
and they became good friends.

02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.080
George W. Bush, he didn't love Obama.

02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:18.960
That's considered one of the smoothest transitions.

02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:21.960
George W. Bush ordered every single person

02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:24.840
in his administration to do everything they could

02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:25.800
to help the new administration.

02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:27.520
That's what a leader does.

02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:30.560
Yeah, humility is one of the things I admire in leaders.

02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:34.280
Well, that felt heated.

02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:37.880
Speaking of which, can you just linger on,

02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:40.200
how do you think we can heal the divide in this country?

02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:41.040
Do you think it's possible?

02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:43.120
There feels to be a strong division.

02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:44.280
I think we can heal the divide.

02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:47.480
I think, as you said, there's so many opportunities

02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:49.720
with new technology to bring people together,

02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:51.680
just as we're using it to tear them apart.

02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:54.920
I have the best job in the world

02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:58.360
because I get to teach so many students.

02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:00.600
I have 300 in my class in the spring,

02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:02.400
in my US history class,

02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:03.560
and what I've found with my students

02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:06.800
is they're mostly not Democrats or Republicans.

02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:08.440
They mostly care about the same things.

02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:11.360
Every one of my students seems to care about climate change.

02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:13.480
I thought you were going to say TikTok, but okay.

02:42:13.480 --> 02:42:14.320
Yeah, okay.

02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:16.480
Second to that, climate change.

02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:19.480
You know, and I think they offer a new future for us,

02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:21.680
and here's what I'll say as a historian.

02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:25.160
We go through cycles of division and cycles of less division

02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:26.760
and less partisanship.

02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:28.800
One moment when we're in a situation

02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:30.960
where people agree too much on the mainstream

02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:32.920
encourages people to go to the extremes.

02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:34.320
When people see the extremes,

02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:36.200
they want to come back to the middle,

02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:37.720
and that is where my students are.

02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:41.520
Most of my students want lower inflation.

02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:43.320
They agree with Republicans on that,

02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:45.760
but they want more to be done about climate change.

02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:47.040
They're in the middle on these issues,

02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:49.800
and I think giving them more opportunity.

02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:53.400
So what's the best way to heal our divisions, honestly?

02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:54.840
Get the old men out.

02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:56.960
Get the old men out of the old men's world.

02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:01.160
Get the old men out and the young women and men in.

02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:03.280
Because they ultimately don't have that same division

02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:05.120
and they're like deeply baked in.

02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:08.040
Not only that, they find it disgusting

02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:09.320
in the way you and I do.

02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:11.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.440
What's the right way to have conversations?

02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:15.720
I mean, just to stay on that

02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:17.720
with people on the left and the right.

02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:21.240
Yeah, I mean, I don't know how often you practice this.

02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:22.160
You care about politics.

02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:25.440
How often do you talk to people who voted for Trump

02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:26.760
or who are Republicans?

02:43:27.320 --> 02:43:28.880
I try, but it's hard.

02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:32.160
75% of the people I talk to are not those people.

02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:33.920
Do you have people who are Trump supporters

02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:35.200
in your extended family?

02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:38.480
Thanksgiving?

02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:40.000
No, I don't in my extended family.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.440
Are they no longer?

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:43.720
They're no longer in my family.

02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:47.480
It's all in its fashion.

02:43:47.480 --> 02:43:49.680
I have taken them out of the photograph.

02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:50.880
You just erase, yeah.

02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:54.920
I do, but I know I have friends who fall into that,

02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:57.040
but it's still a minority of my friend group.

02:43:57.040 --> 02:43:59.360
So I wanna be clear that I'm not as good at this

02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:02.240
as I should, but I think we do have to reach out.

02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:05.880
But I also, I'm less interested honestly

02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:10.880
in re-fighting old battles with old dogs.

02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:14.040
I'm more interested in finding ways

02:44:14.040 --> 02:44:18.880
to get a new crop of people educated and involved

02:44:18.880 --> 02:44:23.880
and engaged without imparting the same partisanship on them.

02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:29.640
So I will support and encourage,

02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:31.320
especially any student of mine,

02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:34.720
but any young person who is smart, has good ideas,

02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:35.560
I don't care whether,

02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:37.360
I don't ask whether they're a Democrat or Republican.

02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:39.120
And I have given money to some young candidates

02:44:39.120 --> 02:44:40.280
who are not Democrats.

02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:45.000
So that's the way, I think it's a generational change.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:49.680
And I think it's reaching out and trying to get people

02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:52.280
to see beyond partisan divisions

02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:54.520
who are in their 20s and teens rather than,

02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:56.040
and that's why we do our podcast,

02:44:56.040 --> 02:44:57.760
this is democracy, Zachary and I do that,

02:44:57.760 --> 02:44:59.880
my son and I, because we're exactly that.

02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:01.160
You will never hear an episode

02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:03.120
where we take one side or another.

02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:05.320
Our goal is to explain the issue,

02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:09.440
whether it's the challenges of democracy in China

02:45:09.440 --> 02:45:13.160
or it's climate change or whatever it is,

02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:16.440
or it's memory of war in our society

02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:17.640
and to explain the issue

02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:19.520
and then offer people an optimistic pathway

02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:21.360
that's neither one side nor the other.

02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:23.880
So actually to push back a little bit on young people,

02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:28.440
I do see that, the exhaustion with the sort of partisanship,

02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:30.760
but I've also, and this I think is the case

02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:32.760
throughout history and I see it now,

02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:35.520
especially in the teenage years,

02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:37.600
especially if I'm being honest with boys,

02:45:38.480 --> 02:45:42.760
there's a desire for extremism in various directions,

02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:44.320
all kinds of extremism,

02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:48.240
like just extreme awesomeness or extreme anything,

02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:52.880
just extreme and F the man that tries to make me behave,

02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:53.920
this kind of energy.

02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:56.480
And that's why you can take any ideology,

02:45:56.480 --> 02:45:58.800
basically any extreme ideology starts being exciting,

02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:00.920
whether you're a Marxist or a communist,

02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:04.080
you're not just gonna be like for socialized healthcare.

02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:06.320
You're gonna be like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:09.080
Let's go full hammer and sickle.

02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:11.080
I'm gonna wear red.

02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:13.520
And then the same with white supremacy

02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:16.920
or just red pill movement.

02:46:16.920 --> 02:46:20.480
The way you see society, the way you see the world,

02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:21.840
the extremism is there.

02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:26.240
And part of that, it's kind of to steal that perspective,

02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:29.400
it can be productive, that energy, if it's controlled.

02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:31.760
And especially if we have institutions

02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:34.360
that keep it a little under control.

02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:38.040
One of the criticisms I have with, a lot of people have,

02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:41.640
I'm actually much more moderate than that criticism

02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:43.840
of universities is they give a little too much power

02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:45.800
to the 18 year old who just showed up

02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:47.960
with their Marxist books and so on.

02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:49.800
And they wanna burn the whole thing down.

02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:50.960
That's beautiful.

02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:53.320
But the whole process of the universities

02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:57.120
get different viewpoints, educate more,

02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:00.440
make that person's viewpoint more sophisticated,

02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:02.720
complex, nuanced and all that kind of thing.

02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:03.640
I think you're right,

02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:06.040
but I think that's more talk than action.

02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:10.080
In my experience, there is, especially among young men,

02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:11.000
you're absolutely right,

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.800
there is a valorization of the tough guy.

02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:18.640
Because most men 18 and 19 are still not fully comfortable

02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:21.320
in their masculinity, however they're going to define it.

02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:26.040
And so a way of performing that is being extreme

02:47:26.040 --> 02:47:27.080
in one way or another.

02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:29.200
And I've definitely seen that,

02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:32.720
but I think it's more often than not rhetoric

02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:36.280
and actually there's a very strong power

02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:39.320
of peer pressure and conformity that works on young people.

02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:41.600
And the positive side of that now

02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:43.840
is the peer pressure among them

02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:45.680
is not to join one party or the other.

02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:47.680
It's to say, this is terrible.

02:47:47.680 --> 02:47:50.240
Look at how our parents are screwing things up

02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:51.880
and they're right.

02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:53.960
And I think we can lean into that

02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:57.880
and get a lot of positive creative action out of that.

02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:00.080
On universities, you brought this up a few times

02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:01.880
and I think we have to be careful.

02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:03.520
I think you and I agree on this.

02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:05.720
It's not that universities are free of bias,

02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:07.640
but universities, especially large universities,

02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:11.800
whether it's UT, MIT, Yale, whatever we're talking about,

02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:13.560
they're large complex empires.

02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:18.160
And most universities, people in the arts,

02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:20.880
tend to be a little left of center at self-selection.

02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:23.840
Those in engineering tend to be pretty much in the middle.

02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:26.920
And those at business schools tend to be right of center.

02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:31.320
And so I think we need to be careful not to generalize.

02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:32.360
At the University of Texas,

02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:34.840
there's as much influence from the business school

02:48:34.840 --> 02:48:36.480
and the athletic department

02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:38.280
as there is from the humanities.

02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:41.080
So it's not a left leaning campus.

02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:43.080
And that's also true at Yale.

02:48:43.240 --> 02:48:44.720
You have the School of Management at Yale.

02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:47.880
You have a huge medical school,

02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:50.760
people who are very professional and less political

02:48:50.760 --> 02:48:51.640
on a lot of these issues.

02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:53.320
So I think we have to be careful.

02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:55.760
I think there's certain pockets of things,

02:48:55.760 --> 02:48:57.840
but some of that you're never going to avoid.

02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:01.080
Engineers are always gonna be the people who-

02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:01.920
Hey, no, easy now.

02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:03.640
No, no, no, but I'm sure you're gonna,

02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:07.480
who want to generally find some objective measure

02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:09.280
and avoid political interpretation.

02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:11.120
They wanna find their objective measure.

02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:14.200
I'm surprised how most people in robotics don't seem to,

02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:15.120
they're afraid of humans.

02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:15.960
They run away from humans.

02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:17.920
Precisely, precisely.

02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:20.800
And the arts people are always gonna be more touchy feely

02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:23.360
and the business people are always gonna like markets.

02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:26.720
My own personal opinion on this is,

02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:28.280
this is just me talking.

02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:31.480
I don't know if it's grounded in data,

02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:32.920
but just my own experiences,

02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:35.920
it seems a lot of the things that people criticize

02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:38.200
about universities comes from administrations,

02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:39.360
from the bureaucracies.

02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:42.960
The faculty and the students are, even with biases,

02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:46.640
are really interesting people and all of their different,

02:49:46.640 --> 02:49:47.600
I wouldn't call them biases,

02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:50.720
but the different perspectives add to the conversation.

02:49:50.720 --> 02:49:53.480
It's the administrate too much, of course you need,

02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:55.680
just like with institutions, you need some,

02:49:55.680 --> 02:49:58.400
but too much, it becomes too heavy-handed.

02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:03.240
And somehow that has been getting a little bit out of hand

02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:06.200
at a bunch of universities, just too much administration.

02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:07.560
And I don't know what the mechanism is

02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:09.520
to make it more efficient,

02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:10.800
but that's been always the struggle.

02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:13.160
Maybe the public criticism is the very mechanism

02:50:13.160 --> 02:50:16.240
that makes universities, the administration smaller.

02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:17.840
Absolutely, we have those issues

02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:20.600
and you can also say athletics has gotten out of control.

02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:21.440
Sure, yeah.

02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:25.120
Like you said, you co-host a podcast

02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:28.400
with your son Zachary called This Is Democracy.

02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:31.360
What's been, there's a million questions I can ask,

02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:33.680
but just that pops to memory,

02:50:33.680 --> 02:50:35.280
what's been a challenging

02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:38.360
or maybe an eye-opening conversation you've had on it?

02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:41.200
Oh, we've had a lot of eye-opening conversations.

02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:46.200
Our most recent episode is an episode on the German right.

02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:50.440
As I'm sure many of your listeners know,

02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:52.640
there was a group called the Reichsberger.

02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:54.160
I think they still exist in Germany.

02:50:54.160 --> 02:50:57.200
They were actually led by a former German prince

02:50:57.200 --> 02:51:00.880
and they had been planning to assassinate

02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:03.800
the Bundeskanzler and were organizing

02:51:03.800 --> 02:51:04.880
all sorts of other efforts.

02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:08.720
They do not believe that the current German government

02:51:08.720 --> 02:51:09.560
is legitimate.

02:51:09.560 --> 02:51:10.760
They think the last legitimate government

02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:11.600
was the Nazi government.

02:51:11.600 --> 02:51:13.640
They see the whole post-war period as illegitimate.

02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:14.880
So it's the German far right.

02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:18.400
Correct, and we had on a member

02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:20.720
of the German Bundestag, of their parliament,

02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:22.720
who's been involved in the investigations

02:51:22.720 --> 02:51:25.240
or in the oversight of the investigations

02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:29.480
and talking with her about the depth of these issues

02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:31.280
and the challenges they face in Germany.

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:34.160
It's certainly not a huge part of German society,

02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:36.040
but it's a significant number of people,

02:51:36.040 --> 02:51:39.200
probably more than 20,000 people who are part of this,

02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:43.280
to me brought home how much of what we thought

02:51:43.280 --> 02:51:45.640
was the past is still in the present.

02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:48.720
And I think that's a recurring theme in our show.

02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:50.080
And our show is optimistic,

02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:52.800
which is not about woes to the world.

02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:54.360
It's actually about taking issues.

02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:56.320
We take a topic each week that's in the news.

02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:58.440
We go back to understand the history

02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:00.560
and we then use that history to make better policy,

02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:02.720
to talk about how to make better policy today.

02:52:02.840 --> 02:52:06.640
And in this case, it was clear that even in Germany,

02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:10.560
there's a lot of unfinished work in explaining to people

02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:13.000
and helping those, for instance, in the former East,

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.200
where a lot of this group has its support,

02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:17.760
why this government is legitimate,

02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:19.240
why it operates the way it does,

02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:20.480
and addressing their concerns.

02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:23.240
It was strikingly similar to some of the problems

02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:24.320
we have in our own society.

02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:26.280
Yeah, it's interesting that there's a far right movement

02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:28.560
in Germany, so you look at different parts of the world

02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:29.800
as well, not just the United States.

02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:31.880
We do, we did an episode recently

02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:34.640
on China, on the effects of zero COVID

02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:36.720
and the protests in China.

02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:39.120
We've done a number of episodes on the war in Ukraine.

02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:43.480
Our role each week is to have on either a policymaker,

02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:46.760
a scholar, or an activist who can help us understand

02:52:46.760 --> 02:52:48.920
an issue and get beyond partisanship.

02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:50.880
So what's been eye-opening are some of the details,

02:52:50.880 --> 02:52:52.760
but what's also been eye-opening, honestly,

02:52:52.760 --> 02:52:55.680
is how easy it is to have a nonpartisan conversation.

02:52:56.520 --> 02:52:57.360
It's not hard.

02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:00.880
We open every episode with a poem that Zachary writes.

02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:02.960
He writes an original poem, I'll brag on my son.

02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:05.760
He's the youth poet laureate in Austin right now,

02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:08.200
and he writes a poem on each topic.

02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:10.360
What's the style of poetry, usually?

02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:11.400
Is he dark, is he?

02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:14.400
No, he's usually, he's often ironic.

02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:16.000
Ironic, like with a bit of humor?

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.360
Yes, and he likes wordplays.

02:53:18.360 --> 02:53:22.120
So he's not like a rebellious, dark teenager that's just?

02:53:22.120 --> 02:53:24.440
No, he's a creative know-it-all.

02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:28.560
Strong words, you would probably disagree.

02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:29.400
But what's interesting-

02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:31.480
Sounds like you're the know-it-all on the boxes.

02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:32.320
Oh, no, no.

02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:35.080
We do have a lot of followers,

02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:36.960
and most of them comment on him, they don't comment on me.

02:53:36.960 --> 02:53:38.640
So I'm the junior partner.

02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:40.640
You're the Yoko Ono of the partnership.

02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:41.840
Correct, correct.

02:53:41.840 --> 02:53:44.400
But what I will say, and this is a really optimistic thing

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:47.880
that I deeply believe, if you frame things properly,

02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:50.320
you open with a poem, you open with questions,

02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:52.480
not with partisan positions.

02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:53.680
Even when we have someone on

02:53:53.680 --> 02:53:55.920
who's a known Republican or Democrat,

02:53:55.920 --> 02:53:58.400
we can have a very nonpartisan conversation.

02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:00.160
I mean, of course we get criticisms,

02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:01.480
but we're almost never criticized

02:54:01.480 --> 02:54:04.600
for being partisan one way or the other.

02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:05.560
It's not hard to do this.

02:54:05.560 --> 02:54:07.200
You just have to make an effort

02:54:07.200 --> 02:54:11.640
to avoid the partisan claptrap that we can all fall into.

02:54:11.640 --> 02:54:13.080
Focus on the humanity.

02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:15.600
What has your brilliant, popular son,

02:54:15.600 --> 02:54:17.200
Zachary, taught you about life?

02:54:18.920 --> 02:54:20.720
Oh, he's taught me so much in his 18 years,

02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:23.000
as has our daughter who's 20.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.520
Two things stand out.

02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:29.520
He's taught me that a new generation has so much to offer.

02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:32.920
And I don't just mean because he's smart and engaged

02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:33.760
as our daughter is too.

02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:36.960
I also mean that you realize when you have a child

02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:38.600
that even though you're doing the same things with them,

02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:41.280
they see the world differently and legitimately.

02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:44.200
And it reminds us that the world can be seen legitimately

02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:45.720
in different ways.

02:54:45.720 --> 02:54:47.360
And it's not that he and I disagree

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:48.560
on major political issues.

02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:51.400
It's actually the small stuff that he sees differently.

02:54:51.400 --> 02:54:53.440
Like in the details, you see that you can have

02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:55.440
very different perspectives.

02:54:55.440 --> 02:54:56.280
Exactly.

02:54:56.280 --> 02:54:58.360
You have a very different way to draw,

02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:00.800
to create a painting of the same scene.

02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:03.400
And then the other thing he's taught me is,

02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:06.600
as I said about the poetry, the importance of the arts.

02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:09.320
I've always been a lover of the arts,

02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:12.000
but it had always been in some ways parallel

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:13.640
to my historical scholarship.

02:55:13.640 --> 02:55:15.960
We need to do a better job of integrating

02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:18.920
as the Greeks did, right?

02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:21.160
The artistry, all the things we do,

02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:22.760
we separate them as disciplines,

02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:24.680
but they're all deeply connected.

02:55:24.680 --> 02:55:26.280
This is what I like about your podcast, honestly,

02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:27.880
is that you integrate all these things.

02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:29.160
You'll have people on with AI,

02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:30.640
you'll have a guy doing arm wrestling,

02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:32.480
you have all these things together, right?

02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:36.280
And it's that these worlds come together

02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:38.840
and there's a lot to gain by bringing the arts

02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:40.040
and the sciences and all this together.

02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:41.640
It's an obvious thing to say, but we forget.

02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:44.240
Yeah, and it somehow becomes bigger

02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:45.600
than the individual parts.

02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:48.600
What gives you hope about the future?

02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:50.960
You looked at, especially with this book,

02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:54.920
it's just such a divisive part of our history

02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:58.280
and the claim, the idea that you carry through the book,

02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:00.960
that that division still permeates our society.

02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:02.160
So what gives you hope?

02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:03.920
I try to end the book on a very hopeful note

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:05.120
because I am hopeful.

02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:09.640
I'm hopeful that these divisions were made by people

02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:11.680
and can be unmade by people.

02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:15.680
I do not believe that what I describe in this book,

02:56:15.680 --> 02:56:19.720
the division, the hate that we see today as well,

02:56:19.760 --> 02:56:22.400
I don't think it's inevitable.

02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:25.120
I think it can be actually corrected quite easily

02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:29.320
and corrected easily by addressing the challenges

02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:31.400
in our institutions, the ways in which this history

02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:33.040
has been embodied in our institutions,

02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:34.800
even though we're different.

02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:37.560
And through our own recognizing of it,

02:56:37.560 --> 02:56:38.960
the gift of the last few years,

02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:40.400
I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican,

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.160
the gift of the last few years

02:56:42.160 --> 02:56:45.120
is that we've been able to see the horror around us.

02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:47.480
And once you see the horror, you can do something about it.

02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:49.320
What's dangerous is when the horror is there

02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:51.280
and you don't see it and it's hidden.

02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:52.280
It's been unmasked.

02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:53.840
I don't care where you stand.

02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:56.720
I've probably spoken in about 25, 30 cities

02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:57.560
about this book.

02:56:57.560 --> 02:56:59.000
Every audience I've asked,

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
how many of you have been shaken by the last four

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:04.720
to five years and everyone everywhere has raised their hand.

02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:06.040
That's a gift.

02:57:06.040 --> 02:57:08.040
That's consciousness raising.

02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:10.720
I grew up in a time in the 1980s

02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:12.320
when we were concerned everyone was apathetic.

02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:13.920
That was what was being said.

02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:16.440
We had lower voter turnout than we have now.

02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:18.560
People didn't seem to care.

02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:20.560
My students, when I was a young professor,

02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:21.400
I'm still young,

02:57:21.400 --> 02:57:23.360
when I was a very young professor in the early 2000s,

02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:25.240
my students all wanted to go work for banks.

02:57:25.240 --> 02:57:26.080
They just wanted to make money.

02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:27.560
The best students wanted to go work for Goldman.

02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:29.120
We're not in that world anymore.

02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:31.320
There's been a consciousness raising.

02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:33.920
Knowing there's a problem, naming the problem,

02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:36.560
gives us a chance to fix the problem.

02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:39.040
And I think that's where we are as a society now.

02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:42.040
Young people are excited to solve the problem.

02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:44.240
Do you think the individual,

02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:46.400
like if a young person is listening to this,

02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:48.480
do you think the individual has power in this?

02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:50.200
Absolutely.

02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:51.840
I think the individual has a huge amount of power now.

02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:53.000
There's a demographic reason.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.760
We've got all these old people who have held on too long.

02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:57.800
Look at president, look at senate,

02:57:57.800 --> 02:57:59.800
look at any institution.

02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:02.120
And they're all, we're reaching a demographic cliff.

02:58:02.120 --> 02:58:05.640
Unlike China, we have a large population that's coming up.

02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:08.960
So those who are watching now who are in their 20s,

02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:11.480
they're gonna get to move into leadership positions

02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:13.840
much faster than their parents did.

02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:14.800
Let's go.

02:58:14.800 --> 02:58:15.640
Yeah, so that's one.

02:58:15.640 --> 02:58:18.880
And then the second thing is just what we're doing here.

02:58:18.880 --> 02:58:21.640
I mean, social media when used properly

02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:23.400
gives a platform to young people.

02:58:24.880 --> 02:58:26.440
They don't have to go through the New York Times

02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:27.360
like I do, right?

02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:30.240
This is why I do the podcast with my son.

02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:32.080
Find other ways.

02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:33.680
You reach millions of people.

02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:37.240
And this can be done.

02:58:37.240 --> 02:58:38.840
You don't need to wait for the old guys

02:58:38.840 --> 02:58:41.520
to give you the check mark that it's okay.

02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:45.320
Just put on a suit, get a haircut,

02:58:46.280 --> 02:58:49.960
start speaking nonsense into a microphone, and yeah.

02:58:49.960 --> 02:58:51.960
Well also, I mean, have a very neat place.

02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:56.280
That's why I love you.

02:58:56.280 --> 02:58:58.160
All right, Jeremy, you're an incredible human being.

02:58:58.160 --> 02:58:59.560
Thank you for talking once more time.

02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:01.160
Thank you for writing this important book.

02:59:01.160 --> 02:59:06.160
I hope you keep writing and I hope to keep talking to you

02:59:06.320 --> 02:59:10.880
because you're the shining beacon of political hope

02:59:10.880 --> 02:59:13.880
I have here in Austin that we get to enjoy.

02:59:13.920 --> 02:59:15.440
I wanna thank you for having me on

02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:16.640
and thank you for your show.

02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:18.920
I think what you're doing is so important

02:59:18.920 --> 02:59:22.360
and I really deeply respect what you do.

02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:24.680
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:59:24.680 --> 02:59:25.800
with Jeremy Suri.

02:59:25.800 --> 02:59:27.000
To support this podcast,

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.680
please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:31.160
And now, let me leave you

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:33.800
with some words from Abraham Lincoln.

02:59:33.800 --> 02:59:36.840
Nearly all men can stand adversity.

02:59:36.840 --> 02:59:40.240
If you want to test a man's character, give him power.

02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:44.040
Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.
