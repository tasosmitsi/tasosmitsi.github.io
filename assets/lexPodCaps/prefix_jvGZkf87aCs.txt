00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
When you imagine a song, is it the opening you imagine?

00:04.120 --> 00:08.440
No, it's kind of a, it's just a, I never think opening.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.000
I never think final.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.160
I think soundscape of how I'm feeling right now.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.280
So it could be the middle of the song for all I know

00:16.280 --> 00:18.240
when I'm, you know, when I'm, when I'm doing that.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.640
But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody

00:22.640 --> 00:25.440
and music really come at the same time.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.340
Like I, by same time I mean, I'm,

00:29.740 --> 00:33.720
I'm, as I'm expressing maybe, you know, I'm feeling like.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.600
Puh, ka, puh, puh, puh, pah, ka, puh, ka, puh, puh, puh,

00:37.600 --> 00:40.800
mmm, ka, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.880
Like it's not that simple, but it's like, I'll hear it.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.560
Like it's like, here's all the orchestra

00:45.560 --> 00:47.520
and you're kind of just pressing all the buttons at once.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.760
And melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.

00:51.760 --> 00:58.840
The following is a conversation with Dan Reynolds, the lead singer of Imagine Dragons, one of

00:58.840 --> 01:04.960
the most popular bands in the world with over 75 million records sold and with four songs

01:04.960 --> 01:08.840
being streamed over a billion times on Spotify.

01:08.840 --> 01:14.160
Given all that, Dan is one of the most down-to-earth, kind, thoughtful, and fascinating human beings

01:14.160 --> 01:20.560
I've ever met, grounded in part by his lifelong struggle with mental health.

01:20.560 --> 01:26.960
The darkness, the love, and the creative brilliance are all there in this one humble mind.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.200
For this reason, and many others, we became fast friends.

01:30.200 --> 01:35.560
Plus, he recently started his journey in programming, which funny enough is where we start this

01:35.560 --> 01:40.480
wide-ranging, deeply personal, and fun conversation.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.160
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.600
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.680
And now, dear friends, here's Dan Reynolds.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.360
We were talking offline that you're not just getting into programming.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.680
What's the most beautiful program you've ever written?

01:57.680 --> 02:01.200
Something that brought you joy?

02:01.200 --> 02:04.600
There's something, I really love completion.

02:04.600 --> 02:07.120
It's the reason that I'm addicted to songwriting.

02:07.120 --> 02:13.720
I like there being nothing and then having some blocks or tools and building them into

02:13.720 --> 02:16.560
what you want it to look like.

02:16.560 --> 02:22.480
And then I find it incredibly rewarding to stand back and look at what you did at the

02:22.480 --> 02:23.480
end.

02:23.480 --> 02:24.480
It could be anything.

02:24.480 --> 02:32.200
For me, it was as simple to begin with as just because it's object-oriented, like making

02:32.200 --> 02:33.200
a cube move.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.520
As simple as that.

02:35.520 --> 02:42.200
Understanding that and knowing that I built that and made it do that is really rewarding.

02:42.200 --> 02:47.680
And I think it's the thing that drew me into wanting to learn more.

02:47.680 --> 02:53.360
But as far as what is some grandiose, like some big piece of code that I've done, absolutely

02:53.360 --> 02:54.360
not.

02:54.360 --> 02:59.880
I'm still at a level where it's more like, what is a tutorial that I followed and got,

02:59.880 --> 03:04.880
and then, yeah, so I couldn't say I'm at a level where I've done anything beautiful

03:04.880 --> 03:05.880
at all in code.

03:06.120 --> 03:12.520
But you're also interested in potentially, like your heart is drawn to creating games.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.280
Creating anything.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.280
And completing it.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.280
Yeah.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.480
That's the good, the feel-good is it's done.

03:18.480 --> 03:19.480
Yeah.

03:19.480 --> 03:27.360
I mean, I've been working over the last two years with actually a team out of Kiev on,

03:27.360 --> 03:31.200
and we can get into that as a whole other story, but on a computer game.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.120
And really have kept that kind of under wraps.

03:34.120 --> 03:38.760
But yeah, we're kind of getting to a point now where we have a prototype that we can

03:38.760 --> 03:41.240
play and it's a lot of fun.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.480
And thankfully, all the team members are in safe places now.

03:45.480 --> 03:50.040
Things have obviously been on hold for a little bit, but when that started is when I really

03:50.040 --> 03:55.000
decided, okay, I need to understand base level coding in C Sharp, so I'm not an idiot talking

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
to these people.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.320
And so it's, yeah, we've been doing that for a couple of years.

03:59.360 --> 04:05.360
Is there any parallels between the final completion that you feel with programming, which I think

04:05.360 --> 04:07.200
is a little bit more definitive.

04:07.200 --> 04:10.080
Like there's debugging, the code doesn't work, it's messy and so on.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.400
There's the early design stages, you're not sure like how to have functions and classes,

04:14.400 --> 04:15.400
how it's all going to work.

04:15.400 --> 04:19.480
And then it comes together and it's really done because it works and there's a cube moving

04:19.480 --> 04:21.240
on the screen.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.040
Is there any parallels between that and music?

04:24.040 --> 04:28.280
Because are you really ever done done with a song?

04:29.240 --> 04:33.680
It's exactly the same thing for me, just in that it's art.

04:33.680 --> 04:41.520
I really believe that we have not fully encapsulated artists, like when we say art, I think most

04:41.520 --> 04:50.520
people think, okay, the medium must be painting or drawing or music or writing.

04:50.520 --> 04:57.080
But I really believe anytime you're creating some things, engineers, for instance, you're

04:57.120 --> 05:04.120
creating something with tools that you have and it can be incredibly beautiful.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.760
And it's never done.

05:07.760 --> 05:14.760
I feel like I look at songs that I've done and I never felt, you have to let go or I

05:14.760 --> 05:19.040
have to let go and that's all I've, I'm just continually making myself let go.

05:19.040 --> 05:25.440
But I look at songs that I've done and wish I had done more or kept going down that road

05:25.440 --> 05:26.880
and what would have happened.

05:26.880 --> 05:33.200
I'm really contained to because of what our band is and what our fans expect and there's

05:33.200 --> 05:39.920
so much more to it that it's like I'm fitting in a box always.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.440
This song shouldn't be longer than three minutes and 30 seconds and I don't know if I remember

05:44.440 --> 05:46.240
the chorus after I heard it.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.880
Maybe I need to hear the chorus three times instead of those two times.

05:49.880 --> 06:01.800
There's certain, especially in pop music, it's really hard to, yeah, it feels like there's

06:01.800 --> 06:04.700
confines even though people are like, well, there's no confines, but still everybody's

06:04.700 --> 06:07.240
writing a pop song that's a few minutes.

06:07.240 --> 06:12.960
Are those explicit in your mind or are they just kind of, the gut is like you said, chorus,

06:12.960 --> 06:15.440
should you have chorus once, twice or three times?

06:15.440 --> 06:17.600
Is that a gut thing or is that a rule thing?

06:17.840 --> 06:18.840
I think it's a rule.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.440
I mean, it's obviously a rule I impose on myself.

06:22.440 --> 06:26.880
Nobody's in my house saying, hey, Dan, if you don't do this, I'm going to punish you.

06:26.880 --> 06:32.960
There's no major label president that's like, imagine dragons needs to make pop music, Dan.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.560
My manager doesn't even tell me that.

06:35.560 --> 06:40.600
I do it because it's what I perceive to be enjoyable.

06:40.600 --> 06:46.300
I grew up listening to a ton of pop music and then I ended up being in what is quote

06:46.300 --> 06:49.540
unquote, a rock band, which I've never perceived it as that.

06:49.540 --> 06:54.380
But that's kind of what the world has called it and that's fine.

06:54.380 --> 07:01.100
So you're a prisoner of a prison that you yourself constructed, there you go.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.300
The confines are yours.

07:03.300 --> 07:07.700
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm a happy prisoner of the prison that I have created

07:07.700 --> 07:11.140
for myself and I made that prison thinking that it was a mansion.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.460
So you worked with Rick Rubin.

07:12.460 --> 07:16.140
What does Rick think about your prison?

07:16.140 --> 07:28.900
Rick was interesting to hear his outside opinion when we first met because my biggest focus

07:28.900 --> 07:35.420
for so much of my life, my biggest fear was, and this stems from I think middle schools

07:35.420 --> 07:41.580
when it started, but everyone being in on a joke except for yourself.

07:41.580 --> 07:48.020
The thought of thinking you're good at something and really you're terrible at it and you're

07:48.020 --> 07:50.980
surrounded by people who are saying, yeah, you're good at it and then by themselves they're

07:50.980 --> 07:54.500
like, he's terrible at this.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.940
Not just in regards to music or art, but anything in life.

07:57.940 --> 08:05.380
And I think maybe from having six older brothers, it stems from that too, always feeling inadequate

08:05.380 --> 08:10.180
and like the annoying younger brother.

08:10.180 --> 08:14.340
Anyway, so Rick's, and that's something I've learned to let go of as I've gotten older

08:14.340 --> 08:21.420
and had life experiences, but one of the things that Rick said really early on that has stuck

08:21.420 --> 08:26.380
with me was he said, yeah, we were Zooming the first time we met.

08:26.380 --> 08:32.980
He said, I'd really like to work with you because I feel like you're not confined to

08:32.980 --> 08:33.980
a sound.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.540
You've done a lot of different sounds and so it's exciting because I feel like your

08:37.540 --> 08:42.340
fans are forgiving more than other rock bands or bands because most people when they hear

08:42.340 --> 08:48.180
a band, there's a very specific sound with it.

08:48.180 --> 08:57.820
They do folk music or they do California rock or they do surf or they do, and your fans

08:57.820 --> 09:00.200
kind of want that.

09:00.200 --> 09:04.300
They want them to do that thing and then they don't do it and sometimes that goes well,

09:04.300 --> 09:09.140
but a lot of times it doesn't and critics and everybody is like, go back to the thing

09:09.140 --> 09:12.940
that you did good and do that.

09:12.940 --> 09:23.220
Rick felt whether he was right or wrong that we could do, we hop genres so much and that's

09:23.220 --> 09:27.420
been to our benefit and detriment, I think.

09:27.420 --> 09:29.660
Why detriment?

09:29.660 --> 09:33.860
Because people want you to be something.

09:33.860 --> 09:38.380
You can believe it more.

09:38.380 --> 09:40.420
It's more authentic if you never change.

09:40.420 --> 09:41.420
I guess.

09:41.420 --> 09:42.420
I don't know.

09:42.420 --> 09:47.420
I mean, certainly it's not something I subscribe to because I create music, but I also grew

09:47.420 --> 09:50.780
up listening to a lot of different genres.

09:50.780 --> 09:56.380
I would listen to Cat Stevens and the next song would be Biggie and then the next song

09:56.380 --> 09:58.340
would be Nirvana.

09:58.340 --> 10:04.060
It was like, I like a lot of, and then Billy Joel and then Enya, it was like, you know

10:04.060 --> 10:05.060
what I mean?

10:05.060 --> 10:08.740
I was a product and I was a product of the 90s, which if you listen to 90s music, it

10:08.740 --> 10:13.580
really was a lot of reason that people say, well, 90s were terrible, like a lot of people

10:13.580 --> 10:14.580
say that.

10:14.580 --> 10:18.260
I love the 90s were my favorite decade of music.

10:18.260 --> 10:24.980
There was a lot of genre hopping and I don't know, I love that.

10:24.980 --> 10:30.860
She had the, 90s had the boy bands and it had Pearl Jam and Nirvana.

10:30.860 --> 10:37.700
And it had a lot of, like Women of the 90s is probably my biggest influence, like kind

10:37.700 --> 10:43.220
of that like angry rock women of the 90s, like Alanis Morissette, Jagged Little Pills,

10:43.220 --> 10:45.860
one of my favorite records of all time.

10:45.860 --> 10:53.500
The lyrics were so intimate and I don't know if she was angry or not, sorry if she wasn't.

10:54.180 --> 10:55.580
Yeah, but there was an anger to it.

10:55.580 --> 10:56.580
There was angst.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.140
Yeah, it was like angstiness.

10:58.140 --> 11:02.940
And that in hip hop of the 90s influences me and then my dad.

11:02.940 --> 11:06.140
So anything my dad listened to, which my dad didn't listen to any of that, my dad listened

11:06.140 --> 11:13.700
to like Harry Nelson, The Beatles, Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Billy Joel.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.940
It was very much like singer songwriter.

11:15.940 --> 11:18.940
Do you mind if we throughout this listen to a few songs, because you mentioned here in

11:19.620 --> 11:25.260
I was actually yesterday and the day before listening to a lot of his stuff and it's just

11:25.260 --> 11:28.660
like, damn, he's good.

11:28.660 --> 11:33.260
And not as known as he should be.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.140
Like I was getting, do you mind if I play?

11:36.140 --> 11:37.140
No, please.

11:37.140 --> 11:38.140
Yeah.

11:38.140 --> 11:43.380
I don't know, not to open this conversation with a love song.

11:43.380 --> 11:46.860
I would like that actually.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.780
Without You is an incredible song.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.980
Oh man, that's yeah.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.380
And the heartbreak and the longing.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.780
What?

12:02.780 --> 12:04.940
He's the best to do it, in my opinion.

12:04.940 --> 12:07.940
In my opinion, he's the best to do it.

12:07.940 --> 12:10.900
The vocal range.

12:10.940 --> 12:21.540
And just the sadness of like, there's something, I don't even want to talk over him because

12:21.540 --> 12:27.420
this is one of my favorite songs too, but I think people have a really good bullshit

12:27.420 --> 12:37.540
indicator and music, in my opinion, whenever I meet a young artist and say, well, I'm trying

12:37.540 --> 12:44.220
to make a new band and I want to do something like how to be successful, I really think

12:44.220 --> 12:48.980
understanding that people have a really good bullshit indicator is the most important part

12:48.980 --> 12:49.980
of being an artist.

12:49.980 --> 12:55.300
And I'll explain what that means, at least to me.

12:55.300 --> 13:06.140
I think that in order to have success or be a leader or whether it's an art or anything,

13:06.140 --> 13:11.500
you'll need to believe that you believe what you're doing.

13:11.500 --> 13:17.860
I think the best actors, really, when they're doing their thing, it's like they, it's not

13:17.860 --> 13:18.860
acting.

13:18.860 --> 13:24.820
They're in it and it's how they feel and they're expressing that sorrow or joy or whatever

13:24.820 --> 13:25.820
it is.

13:25.820 --> 13:31.380
Harry, for me, Harry Nilsson, I just believe it.

13:31.380 --> 13:37.300
He sings that and I feel it and whether he's the greatest bullshitter of all time, I don't

13:37.300 --> 13:38.300
think that's the case.

13:38.300 --> 13:42.420
I think he probably was singing that song and he just could transport himself to wherever

13:42.420 --> 13:44.780
he was.

13:44.780 --> 13:47.100
It's what makes a great live act.

13:47.100 --> 13:53.380
It's what makes a great song and someone could be the best actor and sing that in the same

13:54.380 --> 13:59.300
Same EQ, same compression, same everything.

13:59.300 --> 14:05.500
And there's some unknown there that I, you know, I think hopefully it will be known at

14:05.500 --> 14:06.500
some point.

14:06.500 --> 14:10.700
It's some scientific thing, but there's something there that the energy or something that people

14:10.700 --> 14:14.660
can perceive it and say, true or false.

14:14.660 --> 14:19.100
And if it resonates as true, it's so much more meaningful and it lives on.

14:19.260 --> 14:23.900
And if it doesn't, that for me is what is good art or bad.

14:23.900 --> 14:27.980
Like for people to dispute over, like, well, Sonic should sound like that's silly to me.

14:27.980 --> 14:31.700
It's like a song or even a painting.

14:31.700 --> 14:36.860
Like, it's just the truthfulness of it.

14:36.860 --> 14:43.620
Yeah, the truly great art ghost has to go to that place where you really are feeling

14:43.620 --> 14:47.940
it. Like you forget that you're being recorded, you forget there's an audience, you really

14:47.940 --> 14:48.940
are feeling it.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.100
Yeah, which I totally agree with you.

14:53.100 --> 15:00.500
One of the things that I love about the Internet is it's brought the bullshit detector of the

15:00.500 --> 15:08.940
masses to power, which is beautiful because then the masses uplift the really authentic.

15:08.940 --> 15:14.220
Right. And even if you didn't write the song, I think it helps a lot, probably, if you wrote

15:14.220 --> 15:20.260
the song. But, you know, I was a little bit, maybe a lot since we're in Vegas, a little

15:20.260 --> 15:24.220
heartbroken that to find out that Elvis didn't write his songs.

15:25.300 --> 15:32.740
But I like, for example, Rocket Man, Elton John, like to find out that Elton John didn't

15:32.740 --> 15:38.260
really know where the words of Rocket Man came from, meaning like the depths of it.

15:38.260 --> 15:43.900
It's interesting. But nevertheless, he's super authentic because for Elton John and for

15:43.900 --> 15:49.220
Elvis, there's something in the in the fun and the darkness and the entertainment of

15:49.220 --> 15:53.860
it. Like he goes to some place in his mind that might not be deeply connected from where

15:53.860 --> 16:00.820
the lyrics came from, but he relates it to whatever is in his mind and goes to that place

16:00.820 --> 16:01.380
emotionally.

16:01.380 --> 16:03.180
Yeah. And and that's what I think it is.

16:03.180 --> 16:07.220
And that's why an actor, like I said, can be completely honest to me.

16:07.220 --> 16:12.140
Maybe they didn't write the script, but I write like I've always written all my own

16:12.140 --> 16:18.620
lyrics. It's a really personal thing to me, but I will say I see people all the time who

16:18.620 --> 16:26.100
are performers like Elton John, for instance, who didn't write the lyrics that I believe

16:26.100 --> 16:31.620
that they it means just as much to them as what I wrote because they find the meaning

16:31.620 --> 16:34.420
in it for themselves, at least the greats do.

16:34.420 --> 16:37.060
And I think that that's the difference maker.

16:37.860 --> 16:43.420
And I think you can perceive and I'm sure you've seen art that doesn't move you and maybe

16:43.420 --> 16:49.620
it moves someone else. But for you, for some reason, you perceive it to be uninteresting

16:49.620 --> 16:53.740
to you. And I feel like a lot of the time I'm saying that it's of course sonically,

16:53.740 --> 16:58.380
maybe it's uninteresting to you. But I think the majority of the time for myself, I can

16:58.380 --> 17:04.900
find inspiration in any sonic value or painting as long as I see it and I feel truth from

17:04.900 --> 17:06.140
the person that created it.

17:06.820 --> 17:13.220
Yeah, but for me, the lyrics, maybe not the entirety of the lyrics, but a few words can

17:13.980 --> 17:17.820
can do wonders to take you to a place. And sometimes those words don't need to be

17:17.820 --> 17:22.660
connected with the other words. That's the beauty of music. They're allowed to float

17:22.900 --> 17:27.940
in the space of mixed metaphors. Yes, they're allowed to just jump around and somehow it

17:27.940 --> 17:34.620
paints a picture without actually what is it? Glycerine by Bush. Right. But it's also

17:34.700 --> 17:40.660
the person says it, right? It's like it's the it's the feeling of exactly and the

17:40.660 --> 17:44.620
same person could say that word 10 other ways and you don't care. But someone says

17:44.660 --> 17:51.300
glycerine or whatever it is. And it's like, oh, you know what? I feel that. The way

17:51.300 --> 17:53.940
he said that he meant it to me. You know what I mean?

17:56.580 --> 18:01.660
No, I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving. But I guess that's

18:01.700 --> 18:03.260
just the way the story goes.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.580
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows. Yes, it shows.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.060
Let me ask you to analyze the song.

18:13.500 --> 18:19.820
Do you so there's a there's a lady possibly who's leaving him. Do you think he's

18:19.820 --> 18:21.300
leaving her or she's leaving him?

18:22.540 --> 18:31.060
She wants to when I think of all my sorrow and I had you there, but then I

18:31.060 --> 18:43.140
let you go. And now it's only fair that I should let you know what you should.

18:43.300 --> 18:48.180
And the chorus is I can't live if living is without you. Can't live. I can't give

18:48.180 --> 18:53.100
any more. He's got a voice on him.

18:53.460 --> 18:58.660
Yeah, he does. And if you really there's been some incredible documentation on his

18:58.660 --> 19:05.020
life and the end of his life. And so my answer to this is probably skewed based

19:05.020 --> 19:09.500
on what I've seen about his life, too. But he he was a real alcoholic at the end

19:09.500 --> 19:14.940
of his life and it destroyed his voice and ended up killing him as well.

19:18.660 --> 19:27.420
And so when I hear that, I perceive it as someone who is destructive and in a

19:27.420 --> 19:30.380
destructive place in life and can't love someone properly.

19:30.780 --> 19:33.700
And so they can't live with them, but they can't live without them type thing,

19:34.020 --> 19:36.620
which is really something that I really identify with.

19:36.620 --> 19:43.580
And I think is. You know, one of the struggles of life is loving yourself enough.

19:46.940 --> 19:51.940
Forgiving yourself for four things and letting yourself love someone else.

19:52.020 --> 19:56.620
And, you know, at least when I listen to that, I hear Harry being like, and maybe

19:56.620 --> 19:58.740
I'm wrong, but this is how I perceive it, at least is.

20:01.540 --> 20:05.660
Not loving himself and feeling like he's deserving of this person, like I have to

20:05.660 --> 20:08.500
let you go. I hear that, of course, and people say, oh, well, he's breaking up

20:08.500 --> 20:12.500
with her. But there's so much more complexity and nuance to the relationships

20:12.500 --> 20:17.620
and that knife. And for my wife and I went through really difficult separation.

20:19.540 --> 20:24.020
And that's, you know, a story for another day or different question or something.

20:24.020 --> 20:29.020
But the nuance of it makes me think of this when I hear this, which is.

20:30.660 --> 20:35.340
There's just more to being with someone or not being with someone than, hey, I

20:35.340 --> 20:39.980
think that person's really attractive or hey, that person makes me laugh or not.

20:39.980 --> 20:42.020
Or I love them and now I don't love them.

20:42.380 --> 20:47.460
Love is such a complex nuanced thing that a lot of times there's just more going

20:47.460 --> 20:48.620
on behind the scenes, I think.

20:49.460 --> 20:55.780
Yeah, on a small tangent on that, just as a curious question, have you paid any

20:55.780 --> 20:58.180
attention to the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trials?

20:58.780 --> 21:03.180
I have watched quite a bit of it because my wife really loves it and she watches

21:03.180 --> 21:03.940
it in bed at night.

21:04.620 --> 21:09.100
So it's raw, like to me it's really, cause you, you've mentioned how complicated

21:09.100 --> 21:13.860
love can be and it's, I've never seen, I don't care about the celebrity nature of

21:13.860 --> 21:14.060
it.

21:14.260 --> 21:20.020
I don't care if it was, I don't care who it is, but it's just laid out in such raw

21:20.020 --> 21:24.980
form, the, uh, for the world to see it, for the world to see the toxicity, but

21:24.980 --> 21:30.740
also the passion and, and, uh, clearly sort of, uh, the drugs and the drinking,

21:30.740 --> 21:36.620
but also like the longing and the dreams and I will always be with you.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.820
I will die for you.

21:38.220 --> 21:43.140
The, the, the places, the, the rollercoaster of love and it's all there

21:44.780 --> 21:46.460
at the end, past the end.

21:46.940 --> 21:50.820
So it's like, um, I've also recently reread the rise and fall of the third

21:50.820 --> 21:53.700
Reich about, uh, Hitler Nazi Germany.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.420
It's the rise and the fall.

21:55.740 --> 21:59.540
And it's interesting to look at the entirety of that process after it's all

21:59.540 --> 22:03.740
over many, many decades after it's all over that book in particular written by

22:03.740 --> 22:05.060
the person that was actually there.

22:05.580 --> 22:11.740
And so here we're seeing two people in the context of the courtroom analyzing

22:11.740 --> 22:13.900
this rise and fall of a love affair.

22:15.100 --> 22:15.860
It's fascinating.

22:15.900 --> 22:19.060
You know, the truth is I was telling my wife this actually just the other day

22:19.060 --> 22:23.900
cause she was asking me when I thought about it, it makes me really sad.

22:24.780 --> 22:26.100
It's it's humorous.

22:26.140 --> 22:26.700
Don't get me wrong.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.780
There's a lot of parts in it that are just really funny.

22:30.780 --> 22:35.860
But I look at it and I also see the internet and you know, someone's always

22:35.860 --> 22:39.300
the villain and someone's the hero, which is such a funny thing.

22:39.300 --> 22:42.060
And we, we talked about a little about this offline before we got on this,

22:42.060 --> 22:46.940
but I have a real firm belief in life that it's just more complex than

22:46.940 --> 22:49.180
you think always, always.

22:49.220 --> 22:55.300
And we, and Johnny, for instance, is very charismatic and, and you, you

22:55.300 --> 22:59.300
love him and he's funny and this way he does things and he looks certain

22:59.300 --> 23:03.660
ways and he says things he's just, you really love him.

23:03.660 --> 23:05.740
And I feel like, and maybe I'm wrong on this, but it looks like the

23:05.740 --> 23:08.940
internet is really living like Johnny is the winner.

23:09.260 --> 23:10.820
Amber is, is the villain.

23:10.820 --> 23:13.820
And I kind of look at it and I kind of look at it and I feel like,

23:15.100 --> 23:16.580
were any of you in their bedroom?

23:16.740 --> 23:19.500
Like were any of you there for these things?

23:19.500 --> 23:20.820
And I'm not saying one way or the other.

23:20.820 --> 23:26.900
Like the, all I see when I look at that is two people with a lot of

23:26.940 --> 23:29.580
deep seated hurt anger.

23:30.100 --> 23:33.660
And that anger is so poisonous to both of them and they're, and they're

23:33.660 --> 23:35.820
getting through it in the way that they only know how.

23:35.820 --> 23:40.460
And I'm not saying we should, you know, we shouldn't be able to look at parts

23:40.460 --> 23:45.420
of it and laugh about it and stuff and be virtuous or something, but just

23:45.420 --> 23:51.300
that there's not a hero, I think, unless you're, you've been living

23:51.300 --> 23:53.140
with Amber and Johnny, you don't know.

23:53.180 --> 23:56.220
And just cause one seems more charismatic in the moment or funnier

23:56.500 --> 24:01.580
or more believable, even doesn't mean that their truth is the truth.

24:04.180 --> 24:07.540
And I feel like there's still love there too, which makes, oh,

24:07.540 --> 24:08.380
that's the hardest part.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.340
He won't even look at her.

24:09.700 --> 24:13.140
He looks down the whole time and maybe people say, well, it's cause

24:13.180 --> 24:16.380
anger or, or hurt or whatever.

24:16.980 --> 24:20.860
But I, the way that she looks and stuff, it feels, it just feels like there's

24:20.860 --> 24:23.820
so much hurt there that it hurt.

24:23.860 --> 24:25.140
It hurts me to watch it.

24:25.140 --> 24:29.500
I just feel like, oh, my heart just like aches for them and, and for both of them.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.100
And I don't know either of them personally.

24:31.100 --> 24:36.020
And, and, you know, I don't know, just hurts, but it's, I've never, I've never

24:36.020 --> 24:38.580
seen sort of love laid out in this raw kind of way.

24:38.820 --> 24:42.060
It makes me feel better about.

24:43.500 --> 24:49.020
Like it almost gives you seeing people have gone through a struggle in this sort

24:49.020 --> 24:55.100
of mundane kind of way, gives you room to struggle yourself about the messiness

24:55.100 --> 24:59.940
of love, like you're supposed to like relationship is supposed to be simple

24:59.940 --> 25:02.820
and whatever, but this like, oh man, this it's like art.

25:03.580 --> 25:03.940
Yeah.

25:04.980 --> 25:08.900
And for the record, like, I don't feel like it shouldn't be shown.

25:08.980 --> 25:11.620
Like, I think it's actually really beautiful art.

25:11.620 --> 25:12.100
And I agree.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.900
There's going to be a lot of people who walk away from it and are changed in

25:14.900 --> 25:16.540
certain ways or look at things different.

25:16.780 --> 25:19.620
I'm not saying it's changed in the whole world, the Johnny Deftral, but it's art.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.780
It's just like, you would look at a painting and it might affect you.

25:22.500 --> 25:28.020
Um, my only commentary is more that there's not, I think it's silly when

25:28.020 --> 25:31.300
people say who's right and who's wrong and who's the clear villain and who's

25:31.300 --> 25:34.700
the, like we love as humans, we have to have an answer for everything.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.620
We have to put everything in a box and it's like, well, we're looking at this

25:37.620 --> 25:40.620
and we're deciding you're right and you're wrong.

25:41.020 --> 25:43.980
And I just think that's, it's silly unless it's your life.

25:44.380 --> 25:49.220
So speaking of heroes and villains and highs and lows, you grew up in Las Vegas

25:49.820 --> 25:54.100
and you said that Vegas is a performing town, a town of high stakes, drama and

25:54.100 --> 25:59.380
eccentricity is a town of high highs and low lows, and I'll be damned if my

25:59.380 --> 26:02.780
therapist didn't point out that correlation out to me personally, a long time ago.

26:03.660 --> 26:09.900
Uh, so to me, Vegas from the outside is romanticized by certain movies.

26:09.900 --> 26:15.980
The lows define the beauty of this town and, uh, certain movies.

26:16.500 --> 26:24.660
So to me, Casino, uh, was Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone, um, leaving

26:24.660 --> 26:32.420
Las Vegas with Nicholas Cage, if you're unloading in Las Vegas with, uh, uh, with

26:32.420 --> 26:35.020
the Chinese template, uh, Hunter Thompson.

26:35.620 --> 26:40.620
First of all, what's your favorite representation of Vegas from a darker

26:40.780 --> 26:48.060
side and do you draw any wisdom insight from the, the, the darkness, the lows

26:48.060 --> 26:51.300
and the highs in those movies or is it over romanticized?

26:52.500 --> 26:58.860
So I, I grew up in a really conservative Mormon family and Vegas was established

26:58.860 --> 27:00.460
by the Mormons and the mob.

27:00.900 --> 27:06.580
Those were like the two very different worlds that created what Vegas is.

27:06.660 --> 27:10.100
And if you live in Vegas, it really shows in a lot of ways because

27:10.100 --> 27:14.420
Vegas has the, you know, the strip and the parties and the craziness, but

27:14.420 --> 27:21.180
it also has very like neighborhoods and, and big families and conservative people

27:21.180 --> 27:26.020
and, and, and, and liberal people living together in a really interesting way.

27:27.020 --> 27:34.020
And for me growing up here, for instance, was a lot of like driving on the freeway

27:34.020 --> 27:37.300
and my mom being like, children, close your eyes, there's a naked woman on that

27:37.300 --> 27:40.380
billboard and never came on on our way to church.

27:40.380 --> 27:40.740
You know what I mean?

27:40.740 --> 27:43.740
It was like, but also being like, Whoa, this is crazy.

27:43.740 --> 27:47.300
This is, you know, taking in whatever I could when I could.

27:47.380 --> 27:47.780
Yeah.

27:47.860 --> 27:53.020
Um, so I saw, and I'm grateful for that.

27:53.020 --> 27:56.740
Like, I really love that I didn't grow up as a Mormon in, for instance, like Utah

27:56.740 --> 28:00.660
or something like the typical place, uh, because I, I saw both sides and I

28:00.660 --> 28:03.020
appreciated something from both sides.

28:03.100 --> 28:06.700
And now as a person now who's not religious, but just spiritually minded,

28:07.860 --> 28:13.620
you know, I, I, I, I, I'm grateful for that divergent character, that

28:13.620 --> 28:17.340
juxtaposition dual edged sword that Vegas is.

28:17.380 --> 28:22.540
And I try to apply that to everything in life, which is like Johnny Depp

28:22.540 --> 28:25.020
and then Amber, it's like, there's two sides to every story.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.660
There's always two sides to every coin.

28:26.660 --> 28:29.020
There's always, and there's something to be said for both.

28:29.420 --> 28:34.820
Like I try to see people and, and even if, you know, it's just, yeah, I

28:34.820 --> 28:35.860
try to apply that to life.

28:36.340 --> 28:41.540
As far as a movie that personifies Vegas or, or something in that medium

28:41.540 --> 28:45.900
that personifies Vegas in, in a way that, that resonates with me.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.100
Don't say hangover.

28:47.540 --> 28:48.340
No, no.

28:48.340 --> 28:48.780
Yeah.

28:49.460 --> 28:53.660
I also like, I wasn't even allowed to watch PG 13 movies growing up.

28:53.860 --> 28:57.780
So I, a lot of the movies that you're saying, like I, I didn't, I either didn't

28:57.780 --> 29:01.180
see, I didn't have cable television, you know, I wasn't like a pilgrim, but I had

29:01.180 --> 29:03.140
a really, really conservative upbringing.

29:03.500 --> 29:07.460
So it didn't define your intellectual like development.

29:08.060 --> 29:12.380
No, no, I just, uh, I can't think of any movie that comes to mind where I'm like,

29:12.460 --> 29:13.660
that's my Vegas movie.

29:13.700 --> 29:14.180
You know what I mean?

29:14.180 --> 29:17.500
Like, I'm sure I've seen some of the movies you've said now, but I don't, I

29:17.500 --> 29:23.860
can't think of one that I'm like, actually personifies Vegas in a way that feels

29:23.900 --> 29:28.820
honest to me, like, or, or, or like, wasn't there a Chevy, was there a Chevy chase?

29:28.980 --> 29:29.460
Yeah.

29:29.460 --> 29:29.820
Yeah.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.740
I think that's maybe the only one I thought of that came in my mind where I

29:32.740 --> 29:36.220
was like, cause I love Chevy chase so much that maybe it's one of his, uh,

29:36.260 --> 29:38.100
Vegas Vegas vacation or something.

29:38.180 --> 29:38.540
Yeah.

29:38.820 --> 29:42.380
So, but that's more like lighthearted, that kind of stuff.

29:42.380 --> 29:42.620
Right.

29:42.620 --> 29:47.060
It's not like, I guess what I would say is there's no truth that has been that

29:47.060 --> 29:53.260
I've seen of Vegas, cause what I see of Vegas is, uh, there's obviously like the

29:53.260 --> 29:57.020
parties and stuff in the nightlife, which I'm not big party person, so it's, I

29:57.020 --> 30:02.220
haven't really experienced much of that, but I've also, there's also drugs and I've,

30:02.220 --> 30:04.060
I have a strange relationship with drugs.

30:04.060 --> 30:06.260
Cause I've lost a few friends to drug overdoses.

30:06.260 --> 30:12.380
And so I don't, that's not romantic to me, but there's also like, um, yeah.

30:12.380 --> 30:16.020
I mean, you asked for a dark reflection of, I can, I guess I certainly see a

30:16.020 --> 30:20.500
dark reflection to Vegas and I don't, I feel like Vegas is typically personified.

30:20.500 --> 30:25.140
It's like at the tables and everything, but it's also like, I have like friends

30:25.140 --> 30:27.660
who've lost all their money to gambling addiction.

30:27.660 --> 30:32.180
And so it's like, what I guess, uh, yeah, somebody maybe needs

30:32.260 --> 30:33.940
to make, maybe that's an open spot.

30:33.940 --> 30:36.100
There needs to be a dark side to Vegas.

30:36.820 --> 30:41.180
And it's about Mormons in Vegas that's dying to drug overdose or

30:41.180 --> 30:42.300
getting shot by the mob.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.020
Yeah.

30:44.300 --> 30:48.180
Uh, so you mentioned your spirituality.

30:48.300 --> 30:54.740
You've, um, you said that having a crisis of faith or just the philosophical

30:54.740 --> 31:01.100
question of asking who is God, does God exist or in thinking of the flip side

31:01.100 --> 31:05.380
that of mortality, what happens when we die, those kinds of things were

31:05.380 --> 31:12.020
extremely difficult, uh, deep, um, things for you, uh, in, in terms of your

31:12.020 --> 31:16.540
development, the whole process of figuring that out, um, why does it hurt

31:16.540 --> 31:18.300
so much to lose faith in God?

31:20.180 --> 31:24.900
Yeah, I would say that the seeking of God, let's say that is an obsession

31:24.900 --> 31:26.860
for me and has been since I was young.

31:27.580 --> 31:36.180
I really feel that I'm a deep, deep, deeply like committed to finding

31:36.180 --> 31:39.500
answers in life and there's some answers that I don't think there's an answer to.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.980
And I'm also very OCD by nature.

31:41.980 --> 31:43.820
So I just don't give up to that.

31:43.820 --> 31:46.820
I'm like, well, there must be somewhere in Tibet.

31:46.860 --> 31:50.980
There's some teacher or there's, there's somebody out there that has the answer.

31:51.580 --> 31:53.500
Or maybe it's yet to be found.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.220
I'm going to find it.

31:54.820 --> 32:01.500
Um, I'm really, my life has been to date, probably unhealthily committed to

32:02.300 --> 32:09.420
finding answers about God or the lack thereof and, um, mortality.

32:10.340 --> 32:11.340
It's all I sing about.

32:11.420 --> 32:13.180
It's all, all our records have been about.

32:13.780 --> 32:14.980
Who do you think is God?

32:15.420 --> 32:17.020
Have you ever gotten a glimpse?

32:17.540 --> 32:23.580
You know, I will say the closest I feel like I have been to experiencing God is,

32:23.820 --> 32:30.740
uh, and this sounds so, uh, maybe, I don't know, I don't know how it sounds,

32:30.740 --> 32:32.620
but it's through ayahuasca for me.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.500
That's, that's my honest answer for you.

32:34.500 --> 32:40.020
I feel like I had pretty much given up all hope of there being anything greater

32:40.020 --> 32:47.620
than, you know, us being, you know, evolving and being here and then dying

32:47.620 --> 32:51.580
and you're gone and that's it and nothingness and from nothingness we came

32:51.580 --> 32:57.260
and nothingness we go to where I am now, which is there are answers to be found.

32:57.620 --> 32:58.500
I don't know them.

32:58.820 --> 33:02.660
Like, I don't know what God looks like or if God is anything to do with the word

33:02.660 --> 33:07.540
God and the way that we say it, but I do believe pretty fervently that there

33:07.540 --> 33:10.740
is more to be found.

33:11.340 --> 33:12.980
Is it motion sensor or no?

33:13.060 --> 33:14.020
I don't know what that was.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.660
Looked like they have all died actually.

33:17.420 --> 33:18.220
Do you know which one is it?

33:18.220 --> 33:18.980
Is it this one right here?

33:21.900 --> 33:22.420
That's fine.

33:24.140 --> 33:24.660
Take it out.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.500
Give him a hold of his chair.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.020
See if I can get it like this.

33:31.020 --> 33:31.380
Yeah.

33:35.620 --> 33:36.220
Almost there.

33:37.260 --> 33:37.900
I really don't know.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.940
There's got to be like some saying about this.

33:44.580 --> 33:45.060
There we go.

33:46.860 --> 33:47.940
It's no Chinese proverb.

33:47.940 --> 33:48.860
Yeah, yeah.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.700
Uh, how many people does it take to, what is it on school?

33:52.820 --> 33:53.380
Uh, light bulb.

33:54.100 --> 33:54.860
It was hot too.

33:55.220 --> 33:57.580
It was like, I was doing like the two finger like technique.

33:57.900 --> 33:58.180
Yeah.

33:58.740 --> 34:00.020
Well, I'm glad you survived that.

34:00.100 --> 34:00.420
Thanks.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.820
That'd be pretty ironic if we're talking about mortality and then

34:03.900 --> 34:04.780
this would be it for you.

34:07.940 --> 34:09.660
I've never done an OASCA.

34:09.660 --> 34:11.300
So it's a, it's a mixture of two plants.

34:11.300 --> 34:16.140
One of them is DMT, but a lot of people I really respect very, very intelligent

34:16.140 --> 34:22.140
people had profound experiences with, with I was, what is that?

34:22.180 --> 34:23.260
What, where do you go?

34:23.300 --> 34:24.140
Where does the mind go?

34:24.220 --> 34:25.540
What, what the heck is up with that?

34:26.380 --> 34:29.660
I'll first say that I am like, I can't even smoke weed.

34:29.980 --> 34:35.380
I really do not enjoy it, uh, because I hate to let go of control.

34:35.940 --> 34:41.940
Like if I feel out of control in life, it's like one of my biggest weaknesses.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.300
It's like very scary for me.

34:43.300 --> 34:47.700
I don't, and some people, you know, really enjoy letting go in that way.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.060
I really don't.

34:49.980 --> 34:55.780
So I was pretty terrified to make the jump then to I wasca, but my wife, who

34:55.780 --> 35:03.940
I deeply respect, um, made a profound change, uh, through I wasca and I saw it.

35:03.980 --> 35:04.820
She led the way.

35:04.980 --> 35:05.500
Yeah.

35:05.620 --> 35:10.740
And it wasn't a strange, like, I think most, we have a thing in America that's

35:10.900 --> 35:16.020
like a misconception, a stigma on psychedelics where, you know, it's

35:16.020 --> 35:21.500
like, it's a drug and it makes some people crazy and then you're going to

35:21.500 --> 35:23.380
be on the street and you're going to be out of your mind or you're going to

35:23.380 --> 35:28.420
become like, you know, a crazy person basically.

35:28.860 --> 35:33.340
And I think I really bought into that notion because again, I was raised, I

35:33.340 --> 35:34.580
wasn't even raised with cable TV.

35:34.580 --> 35:35.020
You know what I mean?

35:35.020 --> 35:39.620
Like I wasca is very, I didn't, you know, you can imagine what that

35:39.620 --> 35:40.620
was like for a Mormon kid.

35:40.620 --> 35:42.700
I didn't know anything about it and never touched drugs at all.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.500
And never even touched a cigarette, you know?

35:45.500 --> 35:50.340
Um, anyway, so I think we have this misconception about it where

35:50.340 --> 35:56.260
Americans are quick to go to their doctor and take any medication or

35:56.260 --> 36:06.500
drug, um, but you know, whoa, when it comes to like psychedelics, uh, anyway,

36:06.820 --> 36:10.740
that being said, I, so I had that trepidation going into it, but I really

36:10.740 --> 36:13.820
love and respect my wife and I saw it make a profound impact in her life

36:13.820 --> 36:19.740
where she suddenly was able to heal from a lot of trauma that she has.

36:19.740 --> 36:23.700
She had a really, she went through a lot in her life and it really helped her

36:23.700 --> 36:30.380
heal, but it also set her in a new path spiritually that seemed really like a

36:30.380 --> 36:31.340
place that I wanted to be.

36:32.260 --> 36:35.180
So I did it and I did it twice.

36:35.540 --> 36:38.140
The first time it didn't really have an effect on me, which happens to

36:38.140 --> 36:39.100
a lot of people, I guess.

36:39.740 --> 36:43.500
Um, I drank, you know, this little thing and there was like this

36:43.500 --> 36:45.140
shaman who came over from overseas.

36:45.140 --> 36:51.060
It was really, had been in, in the plant, you know, world for decades

36:51.060 --> 36:55.660
and was a really incredible, um, I don't even know if he likes to be called

36:55.660 --> 37:00.260
shaman, but there's supposed to be like 30, 60 minutes to take effect.

37:00.780 --> 37:05.180
A few hours, uh, the, the, the journey lasts

37:05.220 --> 37:06.980
about four, four hours, four hours.

37:07.420 --> 37:07.580
Yeah.

37:07.580 --> 37:10.660
So the second time I took it, I took, took it in, in, I would

37:10.660 --> 37:12.340
say 20, 30 minutes in exactly.

37:12.340 --> 37:20.260
I started to, I started to feel like I was like the dimension of what is

37:20.260 --> 37:28.940
reality, the curtain was pulled open and there was a lot more to discover.

37:29.940 --> 37:32.380
And it really blew my mind in a way that I think it would

37:32.380 --> 37:34.100
probably blow anybody's mind.

37:34.500 --> 37:39.020
If for instance, God descended or some Christian God or whatever it is, we

37:39.020 --> 37:41.300
all think it'd be this beautiful thing, but in reality, it would probably

37:41.300 --> 37:44.260
make people super fearful and think that they've lost their mind.

37:44.860 --> 37:49.380
Um, like I've always, yeah, I've always like joked that if the Mormon God

37:49.380 --> 37:53.660
came down and told my mom, like, if God himself came down and told my mom,

37:53.900 --> 37:55.020
Mormonism is incorrect.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.980
She would say, Satan.

37:57.140 --> 37:57.380
Yeah.

37:57.380 --> 38:01.380
You know, it's like we're never, I think our minds are just not prepared for a

38:01.380 --> 38:07.060
lot of, of, uh, of anything that's really extreme and it was very extreme.

38:07.340 --> 38:11.380
It was like the curtain of life was, was cut open, which scared me.

38:11.380 --> 38:15.780
But then I felt very much, and a lot of people that I've talked to have a

38:15.780 --> 38:19.100
similar thing where I felt very much like I was either communicating with

38:20.180 --> 38:26.620
something that was perceived as God to me or highest sense of self or mind.

38:27.260 --> 38:29.980
Or mother earth, or, you know, it's called so many different names, but it's

38:29.980 --> 38:36.060
really, it's very, a lot of people have a very spiritual, similar experience

38:36.060 --> 38:40.140
with ayahuasca in just in that it's like this kind of profoundness.

38:40.140 --> 38:45.820
It wasn't like, there was nothing, uh, at least for me, that was, um, that felt

38:45.820 --> 38:49.660
like just like my, like psychedelic funny cartoons or something.

38:49.660 --> 38:53.980
It was like, I'm about to go on a journey and it's, and I'm going to

38:53.980 --> 38:57.620
communicate, I'm communicating with something that feels incredibly wise.

38:58.180 --> 39:02.100
Showed me a lot of things in my life, kind of almost like from a bird's

39:02.100 --> 39:04.980
eye, almost like I was looking through a video camera at a younger me.

39:05.860 --> 39:08.060
There was a particular thing that it communicated to me.

39:09.220 --> 39:16.740
Um, I really have a hard time with, with accepting success and not feeling,

39:16.740 --> 39:21.300
um, like feeling undeserving or something.

39:21.300 --> 39:25.740
I can't quite put it into words, but of, of my position and what I've been given,

39:25.740 --> 39:32.540
I've been given so much, um, and it showed me this thing from when I was

39:32.540 --> 39:34.940
young and explained to me why I am where I am now.

39:34.940 --> 39:41.060
And, and I, I, to this day, like it did not feel like myself telling myself that

39:41.140 --> 39:42.260
that's the only way I can explain it.

39:42.260 --> 39:45.500
Like, and there was a lot more that it showed me and that was

39:45.500 --> 39:46.980
incredibly healing for me.

39:47.500 --> 39:55.820
But just to be like, to put it into a short thing, cause there's so much to this.

39:57.540 --> 40:04.340
It felt, I walked away feeling very convinced that there is more to be known

40:04.420 --> 40:12.540
for sure, and a lot of my deep like things that were traumatic for me didn't

40:12.540 --> 40:15.740
feel traumatic anymore, specifically crisis of faith.

40:16.060 --> 40:22.220
I was very angry at my parents and my community for raising me in what

40:22.220 --> 40:25.540
I perceive to be falsehoods.

40:26.100 --> 40:31.940
Um, and that, and that, uh, I felt like the bedrock of everything I believed

40:32.300 --> 40:33.900
was ripped out for me in my twenties.

40:33.940 --> 40:36.260
And then it was like, good luck in life.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.420
But really my parents had given me everything that they could, and they

40:40.420 --> 40:42.860
believe that very much so still.

40:43.820 --> 40:48.260
But, uh, a naive young me was angry and felt like they had been duped.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.580
And thus I had been duped.

40:50.460 --> 40:56.340
But ayahuasca really showed me this roadmap of like, this is truth and

40:56.340 --> 40:59.740
you're concerning yourself about a grain of sand, which is Mormonism or whatever

40:59.740 --> 41:03.900
it is, and there may be some truths in that tiny grain of sand and there

41:03.900 --> 41:07.940
may be falsities, but so is all these other grains of sand, like focus on

41:07.940 --> 41:11.740
the truth, stop focusing on these little details that are meaningless and

41:11.740 --> 41:15.780
forgive and let go of people believing in those things to begin with.

41:16.500 --> 41:19.900
I don't know if that makes sense, but that was like the core thing I was

41:19.900 --> 41:24.060
taught and to let go of control, stop needing to control everything.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.460
And it felt like the wisdom was coming from elsewhere.

41:26.660 --> 41:31.500
Like it's really, I do not believe at least in my current self.

41:31.500 --> 41:37.580
I don't have that, the mindfulness that I believe that exists in me to, to

41:37.580 --> 41:39.100
reach a lot of the conclusions that I did.

41:39.100 --> 41:42.420
And there was a lot more to it that would be for like a late night

41:42.420 --> 41:48.780
conversation with you, but it's so hard to put it into, you feel like a crazy person.

41:48.820 --> 41:51.740
Any, at least anytime I talk about ayahuasca to someone who hasn't done it,

41:51.780 --> 41:53.300
I'm like, I don't even know where to begin.

41:53.300 --> 41:58.020
Like, how do you explain to someone that you felt like that a multiple

41:58.020 --> 42:03.340
dimension type thing happened in a way that like putting it into words is, and

42:03.340 --> 42:05.780
none of it was words, by the way, that was communicated to me.

42:05.860 --> 42:11.140
It was like, you know how people talk about telepathy and if it, if it existed,

42:11.140 --> 42:14.140
it would be like, I could communicate to you in such a deeper way.

42:14.140 --> 42:18.020
I'm so confined by me having to articulate these words and put them in a sentence to

42:18.020 --> 42:22.620
you, Lex, and then tell you like, if only I could just be like, yeah.

42:23.060 --> 42:24.540
And emotions do that sometimes, right?

42:24.540 --> 42:28.060
You could see my emotions and be like, Oh, that, that communicates a lot.

42:28.380 --> 42:32.380
So that's what it felt like to me with ayahuasca is it felt like it was

42:32.380 --> 42:37.020
communicating to me very clear things, but it wasn't like, Daniel, it's me,

42:37.380 --> 42:41.260
mother earth, let me, let me relax, sit back, let me show you.

42:41.300 --> 42:44.460
But, but it very, it was very clear to me what was being said.

42:44.540 --> 42:45.980
And no, it did not feel like me.

42:46.380 --> 42:50.380
Uh, but maybe science, smarter people than me who've done it would say, well,

42:50.380 --> 42:51.460
it was you and blah, blah, blah.

42:51.460 --> 42:53.220
Like, I don't know, but it was very convincing.

42:53.500 --> 42:59.260
There's a lot of stuff in that subconscious that we haven't explored.

42:59.300 --> 43:01.300
Like we haven't explored the depths of the ocean.

43:01.620 --> 43:05.300
We haven't really figured out what's that, uh, the younging shadow, what's

43:05.300 --> 43:09.980
going on underneath the surface of our conscious mind and what is that connecting

43:09.980 --> 43:12.140
to is that, is that just inside our mind?

43:12.140 --> 43:15.820
Or is it some kind of, is there some kind of collective intelligence going on

43:15.820 --> 43:20.940
where all humans are connected to one kind of, uh, greater organism?

43:20.940 --> 43:22.100
Like what is consciousness?

43:22.500 --> 43:26.980
We have a lot of hubris and thinking we understand any of it, like how the

43:26.980 --> 43:28.620
mind works at all.

43:28.620 --> 43:34.460
Like, what is it, uh, like where, what is the origin of consciousness?

43:34.900 --> 43:36.860
What is the origin of intelligence?

43:37.460 --> 43:39.020
There's a lot of hubris about this.

43:39.100 --> 43:44.540
We, we, we give each other PhDs and Nobel prizes and congratulate ourselves

43:44.540 --> 43:45.900
as if we figured it all out.

43:46.420 --> 43:48.460
Um, but humility is helpful here.

43:48.740 --> 43:53.980
Nevertheless, that is the question that humans have been asking for, um, ever

43:53.980 --> 43:59.740
since humans were humans, which is the question of mortality, the question of God.

44:00.420 --> 44:06.460
Um, uh, so whether it's Hamlet to be or not to be, I think that's the

44:06.460 --> 44:08.140
hardest, the most important question.

44:08.180 --> 44:12.820
Um, Albert Camus asked, why live?

44:14.740 --> 44:20.380
Um, so in terms of crisis of faith, in terms of your search for truth, in terms

44:20.380 --> 44:23.780
of some of the dark places you've gone in your mind, uh, what's the good

44:23.780 --> 44:24.860
answer to this question?

44:26.020 --> 44:35.220
Uh, so for Camus with mythic Sisyphus, it was the question of suicide is what's

44:35.500 --> 44:41.300
the purpose, like what's a good answer to why I keep going, especially when

44:41.300 --> 44:48.020
you're struggling, especially when you're not, um, when you're feeling

44:48.020 --> 44:54.980
hopeless, when you're feeling like a burden in this search for truth, where

44:54.980 --> 44:56.820
you feel like you're surrounded by lies.

44:57.260 --> 44:58.780
What's the good answer to why I live?

45:00.500 --> 45:01.940
I think you ever found one.

45:02.500 --> 45:07.700
Well, it's the simple answer right now is to say for, it's very easy once you

45:07.700 --> 45:12.100
have kids to say the right answer is you just, of course you brought these kids

45:12.100 --> 45:17.780
into the world, so you have a responsibility that I feel deeply as a father to them.

45:18.340 --> 45:22.220
To always be there for as long as I humanly can and to take care of

45:22.220 --> 45:23.100
them and protect them.

45:23.140 --> 45:26.140
It's the most innate sense in me.

45:26.380 --> 45:31.140
Just, you know, it's that it's wired in my animal, my animal existence.

45:32.060 --> 45:33.740
But so if I take that away, right.

45:33.740 --> 45:34.620
Cause that's kind of cheating.

45:35.100 --> 45:37.220
Let's put that aside because it is cheating.

45:37.220 --> 45:37.660
It's cheating.

45:37.660 --> 45:40.140
There's still, you're still, there's still some fundamental

45:40.140 --> 45:41.260
way in which you're alone.

45:41.780 --> 45:42.060
Yeah.

45:42.700 --> 45:49.020
And to that, that actually has been a real struggle for me for many years.

45:49.020 --> 45:56.780
I had a real turning point early in my career where we were flying somewhere

45:57.020 --> 46:04.700
overseas and we were in a really small plane and the lights went out and like

46:04.700 --> 46:10.260
all these red lights were flashing and the plane just started to dive completely

46:10.260 --> 46:12.940
like scariest plane experience I've ever been in.

46:13.380 --> 46:14.780
My manager was next to me.

46:14.820 --> 46:15.580
Who's my brother.

46:16.060 --> 46:19.700
He was crying and texting his wife a goodbye.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.860
That's how like crazy this moment was.

46:23.220 --> 46:23.860
Was it real?

46:23.860 --> 46:32.700
Like genuine engine went out, plane is going down, pilots looking like crazy

46:32.700 --> 46:35.060
in the front and it was a really tiny jet.

46:35.180 --> 46:40.700
And, and like I said, my brother next to me crying, typing a text to his wife,

46:40.740 --> 46:41.820
really, really scary.

46:42.860 --> 46:45.260
And I felt nothing.

46:45.660 --> 46:52.060
I genuinely genuinely sat there and I was like, this might actually be nice.

46:52.580 --> 47:00.220
Like I really felt like this goes down and like, ah, man, life sucks and it's

47:00.220 --> 47:02.140
hard and that sounds so ridiculous.

47:02.140 --> 47:06.060
I know to say, because I, again, I like, I'm in a different place now and I see

47:06.060 --> 47:08.500
my life for what it is, but at that moment I did not.

47:09.260 --> 47:11.540
So life was primarily defined by suffering.

47:11.540 --> 47:12.220
It was a burden.

47:12.420 --> 47:14.100
And it was lifted.

47:14.220 --> 47:16.100
I was incredibly depressed.

47:16.140 --> 47:22.340
I had been trying different medications since I was young and I just had not found

47:22.420 --> 47:23.940
anything that was working for me.

47:24.420 --> 47:27.420
And then I was in a faith crisis, lost all my faith.

47:28.260 --> 47:29.780
Um, started a band.

47:29.780 --> 47:34.820
It's just became, I wasn't ever thinking that this band, I was like, when you call

47:34.820 --> 47:37.700
your band Imagine Dragons, you're not thinking that it's going to be big.

47:37.700 --> 47:38.060
Okay.

47:38.460 --> 47:43.740
It was like, I was like, this was like a side project that was fun for me.

47:43.740 --> 47:45.740
It was like art in college.

47:45.780 --> 47:48.980
I was at, in school and I was like, man, I hate this biology class.

47:48.980 --> 47:50.260
I'm going to write down band names.

47:50.300 --> 47:51.020
Like, you know what I mean?

47:51.020 --> 47:54.500
Like it was not, Hey, put everything aside.

47:55.020 --> 47:56.220
This is my career.

47:56.260 --> 47:56.780
Let's go.

47:56.780 --> 48:02.660
Like it just, it happened and I'm an introvert by nature.

48:03.020 --> 48:08.300
I'm really not an extroverted person who likes to go out and like, I like to be at

48:08.300 --> 48:11.980
home with a couple of friends and have a late night conversation over good food.

48:12.300 --> 48:13.860
Like that to me is a perfect night.

48:14.100 --> 48:17.220
Read a good book, listen to a podcast, go on a walk.

48:17.980 --> 48:20.740
Um, you know, those are things that I really, really enjoy.

48:21.500 --> 48:24.580
And suddenly I'm in this life where I'm like supposed to be something

48:24.620 --> 48:26.100
that I really don't want to be.

48:26.780 --> 48:30.460
Except for on stage, which is a really fast and like strange thing to me, which

48:30.460 --> 48:35.300
is on stage, I feel so free and exuberant and like an extrovert.

48:35.780 --> 48:38.700
And then I come off and I just feel like shrivel back into a show.

48:38.740 --> 48:43.420
Like it's a, it's music does that for me and performing on a stage does that for me.

48:43.420 --> 48:44.780
Can we take a small tangent on that?

48:44.780 --> 48:45.300
Yeah, yeah, of course.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.780
What's the high, can we go through that?

48:47.780 --> 48:51.700
The introvert that wants to cuddle up and read a book.

48:52.380 --> 48:59.060
You're the front man of one of the, if not the biggest rock bands today, uh,

48:59.100 --> 49:00.980
playing in front of huge crowds.

49:02.900 --> 49:06.740
What's the high of that and how can you land back on earth?

49:10.060 --> 49:11.140
The high of it.

49:12.780 --> 49:21.260
It's, it's incredibly beautiful to walk on a stage, sing these songs that you

49:21.260 --> 49:27.620
wrote and see it resonate with people around you and sing with them, different

49:27.620 --> 49:30.660
cultures, different places, celebrate life.

49:30.700 --> 49:33.700
It's suddenly the world seems like a fantastic place.

49:34.100 --> 49:36.620
It feels like we're all on the same team.

49:37.340 --> 49:38.540
It's like one big hug.

49:38.620 --> 49:38.900
Yeah.

49:38.900 --> 49:43.540
It's like everybody in that room gets it and they all, like it, it just,

49:45.140 --> 49:48.860
if it feels like what you want the world to be, which is just like this

49:48.860 --> 49:50.620
coexisting unit of people.

49:50.620 --> 49:55.100
And it's not even about like, you know, I just, it's incredible.

49:55.140 --> 49:55.940
It's for sure.

49:55.940 --> 49:56.580
It's incredible.

49:56.580 --> 49:57.260
And I love it.

49:57.300 --> 49:58.740
And I wouldn't do it unless I loved it.

49:59.740 --> 50:02.100
And then you walk off stage and you turn on the news and it's like, you

50:02.100 --> 50:04.460
see, you know, we're all against each other.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.500
Everybody hates each other.

50:05.500 --> 50:10.100
And if it feels that way in the world, so music really, that's why live

50:10.100 --> 50:11.500
music is so important to people.

50:11.540 --> 50:13.260
That's why music is so important to people.

50:13.820 --> 50:16.300
Cause even if it's just you and that person that wrote the song, you're

50:16.300 --> 50:18.580
listening to it and the two of you feel connected.

50:19.620 --> 50:24.420
You know, it's like, you're hearing Tracy Chapman sing like fast car or

50:24.420 --> 50:27.860
something, you're just like, oh my gosh, like, yes, I get it.

50:27.860 --> 50:29.620
And you feel connected to that person.

50:29.620 --> 50:30.340
You don't feel alone.

50:30.380 --> 50:33.020
Like, so that's the high of it for sure.

50:33.060 --> 50:38.100
And then you get off stage and then, you know, as my, like my uncle's a heart

50:38.100 --> 50:43.580
surgeon, incredible heart surgeon who like writes the book, like he's like the

50:43.580 --> 50:45.180
guy that the heart surgeons talk to.

50:45.220 --> 50:46.300
He's out of Nashville, Tennessee.

50:46.300 --> 50:47.820
He's just incredible genius man.

50:48.580 --> 50:53.820
He, um, always worries and always reached out to me.

50:53.820 --> 50:55.780
He's like, musicians die all the time.

50:55.780 --> 50:59.380
And the reason they die, you know, is because you're getting on stage and your

50:59.380 --> 51:01.580
heart's doing this and your quarters and levels are doing this, you're getting

51:01.580 --> 51:03.060
off stage and then you're just doing this.

51:03.660 --> 51:04.980
And it's a really real thing.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.460
Like you get off stage and you feel like you need drugs.

51:07.580 --> 51:12.780
Cause you're like, I, the world feels like, Oh, incredibly daunting.

51:12.940 --> 51:17.060
And it's also, I'm sure it has to do with like some, some like health things

51:17.060 --> 51:19.940
in your heart and the cortisone levels that are so crazy.

51:19.940 --> 51:23.980
And then you come off and it's like, I know people are like, well, then

51:23.980 --> 51:25.860
nothing's enough except meth.

51:27.100 --> 51:28.420
That is not except heroin.

51:28.940 --> 51:30.580
And that's why a lot of artists turn to that stuff.

51:30.580 --> 51:33.420
And I don't say it in a preach, I don't say it in a preachy way.

51:33.420 --> 51:35.180
Like I've struggled with drug abuse in my life.

51:36.220 --> 51:41.820
And I really, I understand why artists turn to it.

51:42.180 --> 51:45.660
Um, but also the fact that you're an introvert.

51:46.500 --> 51:51.540
So the other side of it, the fame, that's something that you also

51:51.540 --> 51:53.180
said is a double-edged sword for you.

51:53.540 --> 51:57.300
The interesting thing about fame is that you also mentioned, is it

51:57.300 --> 51:59.020
something you can't take back?

51:59.620 --> 51:59.860
Yeah.

52:00.220 --> 52:04.980
So it's a thing you can't just like go on vacation in Hawaii and it's like,

52:05.020 --> 52:06.260
consider, do I like it or not?

52:06.260 --> 52:09.180
No, you're staying in Hawaii for the rest of your life and you've never

52:09.180 --> 52:12.020
been there before, whether you like it or not.

52:12.540 --> 52:18.900
So, um, what's that like being, you know, loved by millions and

52:18.900 --> 52:25.500
millions and millions of people, which is, um, perhaps the best kind of

52:25.500 --> 52:30.140
fame in terms of if you had to choose the kinds of things that are, and

52:30.500 --> 52:32.700
still being an introvert and all that kind of stuff.

52:32.700 --> 52:39.380
So what, um, do you, do you feel alone more alone being famous?

52:40.180 --> 52:40.980
Is there a loneliness?

52:41.460 --> 52:41.900
Yeah.

52:41.940 --> 52:44.140
I mean, it's so, it's such a funny thing.

52:44.140 --> 52:46.620
Cause for, okay, if you had asked, if we were having this conversation

52:46.620 --> 52:49.780
a couple of years ago, I'd be incredibly guarded about this because.

52:51.740 --> 52:58.580
The last thing I want to ever do is sound ungrateful or unaware of how much I have.

52:58.580 --> 53:01.660
And woe is the famous celebrity with money.

53:01.940 --> 53:02.980
Oh, is your life hard?

53:02.980 --> 53:04.740
Is it really telling me about how hard it is?

53:05.300 --> 53:08.060
But I'm also a place in life now where I just like, I'm going to always just

53:08.060 --> 53:11.140
speak my truth because that's the only reason I'm here is I'm here to speak my

53:11.140 --> 53:11.540
truth to you.

53:11.540 --> 53:14.500
So I'm going to tell you my truth, whether it's whatever it is, but

53:14.500 --> 53:16.980
you're human and feelings are real.

53:17.460 --> 53:19.980
And so, and that's the interesting thing.

53:19.980 --> 53:21.020
You win a lottery.

53:21.220 --> 53:22.300
What's that going to feel like?

53:22.300 --> 53:23.460
It's not about complaining.

53:23.460 --> 53:25.900
Oh, it's so hard to win a lottery because you get a lot of money.

53:25.900 --> 53:28.980
No, it's still, you're human and you get to experience these

53:28.980 --> 53:30.540
feelings and it's fascinating.

53:30.740 --> 53:35.020
You put humans in different situations and it's also fascinating because a lot

53:35.020 --> 53:37.380
of people think, well, I would like to be famous.

53:38.060 --> 53:41.460
That's a big thing now on social media, on Instagram and so on world wants to be

53:41.460 --> 53:43.340
famous or rich or famous.

53:43.340 --> 53:46.380
And then it's very interesting to think, all right, well, once you

53:46.380 --> 53:49.460
arrive, are all the problems solved?

53:49.660 --> 53:49.980
No.

53:50.100 --> 53:50.420
Yeah.

53:50.460 --> 53:54.220
So, so I will tell you according to me, what the pitfalls are, whether it's pure

53:54.220 --> 53:57.980
or not, and there are certainly some pitfalls one it's once you're there, you

53:57.980 --> 54:00.500
can't go back, whatever.

54:00.580 --> 54:01.300
Maybe that's fine.

54:01.300 --> 54:08.940
Cause maybe you love it, but the real pitfall for me is that you're now you're

54:08.940 --> 54:14.380
Lex and you're what everybody's perception is that Lex is and that's what you are.

54:15.180 --> 54:22.140
Now Lex is probably a lot more complex and complicated and has a lot more to Lex

54:22.580 --> 54:24.700
than the Lex that is the celebrity.

54:24.820 --> 54:25.020
Yeah.

54:25.420 --> 54:31.860
So, but anybody who meets you, that's who you are to them.

54:32.620 --> 54:36.700
And you may, you may not feel this way, but you may feel confined to actually

54:36.700 --> 54:38.700
have to be that person to that person.

54:39.180 --> 54:41.700
Like I've early in my career for a long time.

54:41.700 --> 54:45.180
Anytime I met someone, I suddenly felt like I had to be Dan Reynolds from

54:45.180 --> 54:49.300
Imagine Dragons anytime I met someone, including my family now who are also

54:49.300 --> 54:50.500
like, whoa, this is crazy.

54:50.500 --> 54:52.180
You're like Dan Reynolds from Imagine Dragons.

54:52.820 --> 54:57.900
And I wanted to just be the goofball that I have been my whole life with my

54:57.900 --> 55:01.740
brothers and family, but suddenly I found myself feeling like, no, I have to be

55:01.740 --> 55:04.540
this like, cause that's who, that's who this is.

55:05.140 --> 55:06.620
So you're almost like playing a role.

55:06.620 --> 55:09.380
And it's like, I've heard a lot of actors talk about this where they'll take on a

55:09.380 --> 55:12.340
role and then it's like, they feel like they have to, they like become that.

55:12.380 --> 55:14.580
And it's a really scary thing.

55:14.580 --> 55:19.620
And like you alter who you are almost to fit the notion of other people.

55:19.860 --> 55:25.620
Cause especially if a lot of artists are empaths, it, you know, a lot of people

55:25.620 --> 55:27.460
who get into art in a deep way are empaths.

55:27.460 --> 55:32.340
And so you feel a lot of what people are feeling and you're never wanting to

55:32.340 --> 55:37.100
burden people and you're always wanting to deliver to that person, you know, what

55:37.100 --> 55:40.820
they want is like people pleasing is very, it goes hand in hand with a lot of like

55:41.740 --> 55:45.740
these famous people and they get to where they were because they know how to do that.

55:45.780 --> 55:48.780
They know how to be in a room with someone and look them in the eye and make

55:48.780 --> 55:50.620
them feel like they're the only person in the room.

55:51.060 --> 55:54.260
And then now they got that role in that movie because they sat with the casting

55:54.260 --> 55:57.420
director and they were like, oh, so funny.

55:57.420 --> 55:59.860
Oh, has anybody told like put on the charisma, do it all.

55:59.860 --> 56:04.100
And it's like, anyway, I'm like, I'm going on a different tangent here, but

56:04.740 --> 56:08.460
long story short, there's a lot of things that are really unhealthy about it.

56:08.700 --> 56:12.700
And then a lot of people who want the fame, then the second it starts to go away,

56:12.700 --> 56:14.780
then they're like, who am I anymore?

56:14.780 --> 56:16.020
Like that was everything.

56:16.020 --> 56:19.260
And now I'm like on the down and now I'm not a famous person anymore.

56:19.260 --> 56:21.740
And now I hate myself and I'm going to do drugs.

56:21.740 --> 56:25.380
And it's like, it's like this vicious cycle, like you could never be famous

56:25.380 --> 56:29.300
enough, you're always going to get like, there's just so much to it that I've

56:29.300 --> 56:35.740
just, and I, and again, like I've lost friends in this career to, to that for sure.

56:36.980 --> 56:41.100
And there's a certain element to sort of just on the, the losing fame of

56:41.580 --> 56:46.740
a lot of folks, um, especially young folks, like in YouTube.

56:46.860 --> 56:50.620
So fame is a thing that has levels.

56:50.980 --> 56:52.740
You're always trying to be a little more famous.

56:52.860 --> 56:54.300
A lot of folks were chasing fame.

56:54.300 --> 56:55.340
It doesn't matter how famous you are.

56:55.340 --> 56:56.580
You're always trying to chase more.

56:56.780 --> 57:00.740
And when you start to lose it, interesting things can happen if you're not self

57:00.740 --> 57:07.620
aware, which is like, like you mentioned, you might be trying to grasp back at

57:07.620 --> 57:11.100
where you were by leaning into the formula that got you there.

57:11.460 --> 57:16.100
And so the, the, the, the constraints of the image that you mentioned becomes

57:16.100 --> 57:20.460
the thing that you're now trying to lean into, like, and that that's actually

57:20.460 --> 57:22.540
walking away from who you really are.

57:22.580 --> 57:26.780
Like you lean further into being that person that's true for acting.

57:26.780 --> 57:31.780
That's true for, um, even on like YouTube, which is people acting, they

57:31.780 --> 57:34.020
have a role, they got them to the table somehow.

57:34.540 --> 57:41.700
Yeah, it's, um, it's dark, but I think those are, that's just put for

57:41.700 --> 57:46.140
everybody to see, um, but that's a very human struggle, even when you're not

57:46.140 --> 57:51.700
famous, finding yourself, being yourself of, uh, not letting, not doing the

57:51.700 --> 57:56.180
people pleasing at any scale and being trapped by that.

57:56.220 --> 57:56.460
Yeah.

57:56.460 --> 57:58.780
And, and also feeling like it's never enough.

57:58.900 --> 58:03.660
I think that's something all like very not, it's not just a famous thing,

58:03.660 --> 58:06.340
but it's like in the whole, like everybody deals with feeling like

58:06.340 --> 58:07.740
when I'm here, I'll be happy.

58:08.620 --> 58:09.980
When I get that job, I'll be happy.

58:10.060 --> 58:12.300
When I have that money, then I'll be happy.

58:12.740 --> 58:16.700
When my, when I get that surgery and my nose looks like this, I will be happy.

58:16.700 --> 58:24.540
Then it's like a constant chase of happiness instead of happiness.

58:25.300 --> 58:27.660
It's like the opposite, it's opposite of self-love.

58:27.660 --> 58:29.340
It's the opposite of happiness.

58:29.900 --> 58:31.740
Uh, it's, there's no presence to it.

58:31.940 --> 58:32.660
You're constant.

58:32.700 --> 58:34.100
You're never going to find it.

58:34.220 --> 58:37.180
You're never going to arrive and you're just going to live your life.

58:37.260 --> 58:39.820
And then you're going to be on your deathbed and be like, I was chasing

58:39.820 --> 58:42.300
the wrong thing, my whole life.

58:42.420 --> 58:46.300
You know, I should say that podcasts are interesting in that way.

58:46.300 --> 58:51.260
So for me personally, because you just talk a lot, you can't people that

58:51.260 --> 58:54.540
meet you, they know you and then know the evolution of you.

58:54.940 --> 59:00.220
And that's the same thing for like you right now, uh, Dan of Imagine Dragons,

59:00.220 --> 59:07.020
just being on a podcast, like long form reveals the side that liberates

59:07.020 --> 59:11.300
you more to be yourself, to like people see that, oh, there's a human.

59:12.140 --> 59:15.820
They, cause they, you know, music, they have a deep connection with you.

59:15.820 --> 59:19.980
They have experiences with you the way they experienced it.

59:19.980 --> 59:22.420
And that's who you are with them through the songs.

59:22.740 --> 59:25.620
But now you get to see, oh, that's a, that's a, that's a human being.

59:26.020 --> 59:27.140
He probably gets angry.

59:27.140 --> 59:28.020
He gets sad.

59:28.260 --> 59:29.140
He's excited.

59:29.340 --> 59:33.340
He's hopeful, you know, and there's a core, that's a good human being, but

59:33.340 --> 59:37.100
though the whole rollercoaster of emotions all there, it's a giant, beautiful

59:37.100 --> 59:38.860
mess and podcasts reveal that.

59:38.860 --> 59:40.700
That's why I love podcasts like long form.

59:41.220 --> 59:44.820
You get to, you get to hear some artists and actors and so on.

59:45.020 --> 59:53.340
And some of them you get to see, oh, you've lost yourself in the, um, in the

59:53.340 --> 59:56.380
surface, that's a tragedy with some actors, some great actors.

59:57.180 --> 01:00:01.860
If they've, they've left so much of themselves in the roles they've played

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:07.980
that they can no longer be the thing they were before those great roles.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:08.900
That's for sure.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.500
That's it's hard.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.380
It's hard to see.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.260
So you get to see that with Johnny Depp with, I don't know, pirates.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.220
He was talking about that with Pirates of the Caribbean.

01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.700
That was a shift, right?

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.260
Like he's not that guy, right?

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.020
He's forever, forever, forever that guy.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.180
But the point is to remember that you're not into your family, which is

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:28.540
interesting.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.940
You said with your family, um, when I see people close to me, they also,

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.700
there is an element like that while you're that, they start

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.180
treating you like the famous person.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:38.980
Yeah.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:44.420
You know, I, I'm fortunate to have my manager, who's my brother, my older

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.380
brother, and my lawyer is my other older brother.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:53.220
And that's been helpful because like it's weird.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.140
It gets weird with everyone, no matter what.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:59.260
One of the best advice I was given was by, uh, Charlie Sheen.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.540
You got advice from Charlie Sheen?

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:00.740
Yeah.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:06.100
We were playing, uh, the wise sage of our generation, wise sage Charlie Sheen.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.740
But it was, it was really wise.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:11.740
I was sitting next to him and we were, we were playing some late night

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.100
television and he said, this was right at the beginning.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.540
And he just said, boys, just mark my words.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.020
Your life is about to get really weird.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.180
That's all I said, but it's stuck with me forever.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.740
It's Charlie Sheen's, of course it sticks with you.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.260
And I remember being like, right.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.100
Okay, Charlie Sheen, I'm not Charlie Sheen.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.060
It's not going to get weird.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:34.380
Like, you know, um, but it got really, really weird, really quick

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:38.780
because suddenly you've existed your whole life in this way where everybody

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:42.420
just, everything you get, you achieved.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:44.220
It was because you got it.

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:48.540
And every conversation you had, like if someone liked you at the end of that

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.860
conversation, well, it's cause they liked you, they didn't like you.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.220
Cause they didn't like you and you can make complete peace with that.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.500
At least I could my whole life.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:01.900
I was like, life is a challenge and be myself and I'm going to go through it

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:05.180
and find some people along the way that I connect with and others know.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:10.580
And that social integrity is so important to us.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.820
And we think it would be nice to have this.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:16.060
And this is going back to the pitfalls of fame.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:20.180
We think it would be nice to walk into a room and have everyone be like,

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.700
yeah, and you could be like, dumpster fire and everybody's like, Oh my gosh,

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.900
dumpster fire is amazing.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.180
You said dumpster fire was amazing.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:35.540
It's like, it's incredibly, incredibly lonely and it just breaks everything

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:39.060
that you knew about humaneness and it sucks.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:44.420
So then you're seeking out people who that it doesn't exist with and families

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.500
are closest you can get to that for sure.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.620
But even your family, it's going to take a little bit where they're like,

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.500
Oh, this is a little weird.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.780
Like all my friends at work are now asking about you and you're my young,

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:54.620
stupid brother, but now you're suddenly like the young, stupid brother that

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.940
they want an autograph from and stuff.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.340
And it's, it still makes like, they have to get over that and figure that out.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:05.460
And, and, and then you meet people too, who know about this whole concept and

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.020
they're like, well, I'm going to be an asshole to him to show him that I don't

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:14.100
subscribe and you're dealing with like people who are like dumpster fire.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.060
The person who's like, you know, you could say something actually

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.580
profound and nice and they'd be like, that's stupid and you're an idiot.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.860
Cause it's like an actual attempt to like show you how much they don't care.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:32.100
So you live in this very, like this still, nevertheless, even when nobody knew you,

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.460
you were seeking for deep human connection with a small number of people.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:40.540
And now when a lot of people know you, you're still looking for deep

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.860
connection with a small number of people.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.780
The struggle is the same.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:45.060
Yeah.

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:49.740
Uh, can you, can you speak to, cause you mentioned some of the dark moments on

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:54.420
what advice did you give to people who are struggling with depression and maybe

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:58.820
for the people who love the people who are struggling with depression.

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:06.980
So what I have found to be most successful for me, um, it's, it's back to

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:12.100
the basics of everything that the therapist or psychologist will tell you.

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:16.900
Psychiatrists will tell you right when you meet them, which is exercise every

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.660
day, eat healthy for sure.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.380
Find time, make time every day to do something that you love.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:31.460
Whatever that may be, whatever brings you joy and you might, and when you're

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:35.020
really depressed, that actually feels like nothing because the things that

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.980
brought you joy don't bring you joy anymore when I'm really in the thick of it.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:45.660
But, um, for me, like this is the cycle that I I'll go through is I'll look at

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.300
my life and I'll say, okay, what, what, what can I clean up?

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:48.740
All right.

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:52.980
Well, for me, it was cutting out alcohol actually helped me a lot.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:58.980
Um, I know that sounds like a big, I'm not like, I'm not judging anybody for

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:02.660
that and I still, you know, drink on occasion, but I felt like alcohol has

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.980
been very unhelpful to my mental state.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.140
Um, I feel less drive and less happiness the next day for things that I want to

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.180
do, I feel like it plays a lot with your serotonin.

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.660
So look for stuff to change.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.340
Clean living.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:15.780
Yeah.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:21.060
Clean living, but also understanding that, that sometimes it's just, it just

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:25.780
is, and you just keep breathing and, and it will get better with time.

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.060
This too shall pass.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:27.900
This too shall pass.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:32.460
Like I, I really think that, uh, in the winter, you know, I, I, I'm pretty sure,

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.300
I mean, I've had a lot of, I've seen a lot of therapists and all of them say

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.140
the same thing, which is like, you have major depressive disorder and this is

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:41.340
what it is, but it's certainly worse for me in the winter months.

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:45.020
So I know there's like, um, I can't think of the term for it, but there's

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.060
a term for like seasonal depression.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:47.460
There it is.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:51.940
Um, so I'll get to the winter and suddenly I'm like, geez, everything

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.340
really sucks on a deeper level.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:58.220
And then, you know, so it's like, this too shall pass is another thing.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:00.780
It's like, just practice those things.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.660
Absolutely see a therapist.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:06.980
That's my big, like my biggest emphasis of life is to like on stage, like my

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.460
goal, like I have a few things that I really, really care about.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:13.540
One is, is, is mental health, health and de-stigmatizing therapy.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.300
Cause for me, I didn't go to therapy for a long time because I felt that

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.140
it would be admitting that I was broken.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:23.300
It'd be admitting that I was weaker than Lex who doesn't have to go to a

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.420
therapist because Lex is stronger.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.900
So be strong like Lex.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:30.180
You know, I would like look at all my older brothers and I looked up to them

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.260
so much and there were all these incredibly successful people, plastic

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:38.660
surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a dentist, two attorneys, Stanford, NYU, like just

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:45.380
like incredible high standards Eagle scouts, you know, like they valedictorians,

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.740
like they just did it all.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:54.660
So for me, I was very, really did not want to admit and none of them went to therapy.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.540
So it was like, what are you going to be?

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.940
Are you, are you broken?

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.260
Are you like the weak one who can't hack life?

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.940
And I think that's incredibly dangerous.

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.380
And I feel like it almost cost me my life because I took so

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:08.460
long to finally go to therapy.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:13.740
So I really want kids to know, Hey, like the great people that achieve great

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.780
things that are doing amazing things.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.620
They probably have help almost all of them.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.940
It's like going to the gym, but it's a mental gym.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:21.580
What?

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.700
Um, so I, unfortunately, I want to be a psychiatrist when I was growing up.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:29.020
Uh, maybe, maybe that's why I like podcasts.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.380
Maybe that's, I think you'd be a good one.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.460
Maybe I would, I would, I think you are a psychiatrist pretty much, right?

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.340
Sounds like you're a psychiatrist.

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:37.060
I think I need more.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:43.140
I think, I think actually to be a good psychiatrist, you also need to be seeking

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:48.700
therapy from the, like, you also need to be, have some stuff to work through in

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.660
your mind, I think, uh, yeah, you have to have gone to some dark places.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:59.180
Um, what the thighs, the, the empathy, it's the ability to empathize.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:03.820
And especially if you've directly experienced that you can, you can go to

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.380
those places in your mind, like, like you said, it's with the music to be authentic.

01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:08.340
You have to really go there.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.660
What, um, why did therapy help so much?

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:14.260
What is the process of therapy?

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:18.220
If you can just educate a little more, is it, are you

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:24.820
basically bringing to the surface and talking through things that you, because

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:31.220
of the, the momentum of life, you just never allow yourself to speak through,

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.380
to think through, is that what therapy is, or is there some more systematic thing?

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:39.820
So I've been to a lot of strange, different kinds of therapy.

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:43.940
So I'll tell you my first therapist, if I could sort of interrupt, uh, how hard

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:47.140
is it to find a therapist that connected with you?

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.540
It is, it's actually pretty hard, I think.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:55.020
I think, I think, uh, it for, well, actually I have a skewed view of that

01:08:55.060 --> 01:09:01.740
because going back to the beginning of my therapy was with a Mormon therapist.

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:05.660
So it was very much like, well, are you reading your book of Mormon?

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:06.940
And are you praying at night?

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:07.860
You know what I mean?

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:10.540
Like that was a big focus of my therapy to begin with.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:13.700
And you're having a faith crisis in the distance.

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:14.100
Yes.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:16.980
It's like, well, and then.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:17.940
You're making it worse.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:18.540
Yes.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:25.260
The next therapist I went to was, uh, a Scientology therapist.

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:28.980
I met my wife and she was Scientologist at the time and she's not anymore.

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:34.740
She's like, it's such a funny thing to like, to look back on because we met,

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:38.140
and I was like this Mormon missionary who had just got home from his mission.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.100
And I met her and I was, she's a Scientologist.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.700
I was like, wow, that's bad shit crazy.

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.820
Like, I'm not like that stuff's crazy.

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:44.740
And she's like, what are you talking about?

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.580
That's you're crazy.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.140
You're Mormon.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.460
That's bad shit crazy.

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:53.980
And the two of us were like, huh, maybe there's something to this, to both of us here.

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:54.420
Yeah.

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:58.180
The tension actually forces you to think through like, Oh, well, what is true?

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:58.580
Yeah.

01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:58.900
Yeah.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:03.260
And we really fell in love through that, which was like, maybe we're

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.780
both on the wrong track.

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.220
Let's figure this out.

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:13.580
But before that happened, we went to a Scientologist therapist who that therapy

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:17.380
consisted of, what have you done wrong to Asia?

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.900
And they asked, they would ask me that question over and over and over and over.

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:24.900
And so I'm like thinking of the deepest, darkest things that were in the recesses

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.660
of my mind.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:26.420
This was a therapy.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.580
This was marriage therapy.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.380
Anyway, I'm not going to get into that, but it was, it was Scientology therapy.

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.500
So that was a different thing.

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.580
And then I went to therapy therapy, like, no, it's not attached to any religion.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.660
And that was a really great experience for me.

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:43.380
And, and since then I've been through a couple of different therapists, but that

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.100
was more because where I was and moving and things like that.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.740
So is it that hard to find a great therapist?

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.180
Probably not, but maybe don't go to your Mormon therapist person.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:57.420
That's Scientology therapist, or maybe that's, maybe that's the route for you.

01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.460
Maybe it's the route for you.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:10:58.820
I don't know.

01:10:59.060 --> 01:10:59.540
Yeah.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:02.580
But what is, so is it bringing stuff to the surface basically?

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:04.300
What's the, I didn't even answer your question.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:05.300
What's the effect?

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.460
Why is it so effective?

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:09.700
Just, um, is there something you could put words to?

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:10.340
Yeah.

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:13.180
I mean, I think it's obviously there's the common things you would think of,

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.780
which is like, oh, I've been holding these things in and I don't want to tell

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:19.700
anybody, and then I tell this person and there's relief in that, but that's

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:21.420
really not where the real work comes from.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:26.340
I think the real work is meeting with someone who is well versed and

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.500
educated and understands.

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.580
It's like, it's like coding.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.420
It really is.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.180
It's like someone who like, they listen to you and they're like, well, that

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.300
was a trigger and then this became this trigger and you're probably every time

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.260
you're hearing that thinking of this thing that happened earlier in your life.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:44.020
And they just will walk you through scenarios and maybe some of them aren't

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.180
right, but some of them you'll be like, it'll resonate.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.980
Sometimes you're like, wow, I am feeling that because of that.

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.020
And that did happen.

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.260
And maybe if I tell, call my mom and say this to her, it will make me feel better.

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:55.500
Hey mom, this happened.

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.380
It's like work.

01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.100
You, you, you put in work and you have hard conversations and do difficult things.

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.900
And if, so if your therapy is not difficult, I actually think

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.300
that's, that's not good therapy.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.220
Good therapy is it's going to be a little difficult.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:08.860
It's work.

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.340
Like, um, during and after.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.140
Yes.

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:16.060
Like I had this incredible therapist who was, who had, I told him when I was

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:19.220
going to do ayahuasca, he was like, Jesus, you know, he had, he had actually

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:23.660
was a doctor before and a really well educated, studied person who had walked

01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:25.940
away from a brain doctor.

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:27.300
What's the word for that?

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.580
Brain doctor, a brain surgeon, neurologist and neurologist.

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:34.780
And he, uh, and he's, and he said, well, basically his belief was that

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:39.660
ayahuasca was like, basically doing therapy, like 50 sessions.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.940
He was like, it's, it's, it's like really intensive.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.260
He was like, you, I don't know if you want to do that.

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:48.140
If you do, you can, you can make some big steps forward, but I prefer

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:53.620
just to do one, once in one session at a time and, um, so yeah, it's hard work.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:57.420
And that I typically like, it's really hard for me to even talk about

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.900
ayahuasca by the way, going back to that, because I'm not looking to

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.500
tell everybody to go do ayahuasca.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.380
It's incredibly hard.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.980
It was the scariest experience of my entire life.

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:09.900
It felt like I went to heaven, but it also felt like I went to the

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:13.900
darkest, deepest hell that was incredibly scary.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.100
Um, incredibly scary.

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:17.620
Yeah.

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:24.940
He told the story of how you wrote the song, believer or like, um, your,

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:29.180
your childhood friend, I guess, uh, Donald, like, like bullying

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.140
and that kind of stuff.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:35.460
This song, I mean, a lot of your songs are super interesting, sort of, um, in

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.460
terms of percussion, super interesting, super interesting lyrically, just how

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:43.980
it flows and also pain is at the center of it.

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:47.860
I mean, a lot of, like you said, the crisis of faith, some of these

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:52.820
existential questions are basically behind a lot of your songs, funny enough.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.660
Um, maybe they're covered in metaphor, so it's hard to see.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:03.700
Um, but it's there and this song is really, is really interesting in that

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:07.780
way that it puts, uh, you know, pain.

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.060
You made me a believer.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.180
You break me down, you build me up, believer.

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:15.780
That's so interesting.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:20.180
Um, maybe can you tell this, the story of how the song came to be?

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:21.380
I'd love to listen to it too.

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:23.380
I have some questions musically about it too.

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:23.660
Yeah.

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.580
It's exactly what we're talking about with therapy.

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:35.060
I just feel like the greatest things in my life have come from the deepest hurt.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:42.100
Like losing someone, you know, that you love is maybe the hardest part of the

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.100
human path for me, at least thus far.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.460
Like I, when I think of, okay, what was the hardest thing?

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:51.220
There's like, okay, you know, I'm not going to be able to, I'm not going to be

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.820
When I think of, okay, what was the hardest thing?

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:56.340
There's like, okay, you know, there's like, you think of physical pain or maybe

01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:59.820
like going through financial pain or whatever, I think losing someone that

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:05.980
you really love to death is one is one of the hardest for me, I would say it

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:10.700
was the hardest and, um, but it also makes you look at your life completely

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:15.340
differently and alter your life, at least for me in ways that were really healthy.

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:20.100
Um, being more present, uh, letting go of things that were meaningless,

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:23.860
trying to control what other people think about you, like wasting your time

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:29.020
on things like that, and you suddenly see like, wow, like time, I got a

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.140
small amount of time, like, how do I want to spend it?

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:33.420
I'm going to spend it in the best way I know how, and that's it.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:38.340
So yeah, I mean, that's, it's a, it's a basic comment concept that's been said

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:41.820
a million times over in a million different ways, but that's pretty much

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:45.100
what I was trying to say with Believer, which is like, I've lost face and faith

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:50.740
in everything, uh, at that time period and, you know, or previous to that time

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:57.060
period, and then I was rebuilding my faith or my, my spiritual thought process.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:03.060
And it was after ayahuasca and it was like, you know, finding being a believer

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:07.860
and that, and that's not necessarily like a believer in God or a believer in

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:14.340
heaven and hell or anything like that, but a believer in more believing in,

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:19.420
in goodness, believing in that there is some light, like, and, and again, those

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:24.620
words, like, they're just words and I wish there were better words to formulate

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:29.820
the thought that I'm trying to express, but just more, uh, like the thought of

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:35.220
me dying for me, I don't fear it.

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:42.380
I don't fear it, but actually I really fear not seeing my kids again.

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.740
I'll say that that is fearful for me.

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:51.260
I feel like I love so deeply these children that the thought of like leaving them for

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:54.820
me is a, is a, a scary thought or some, some

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.900
they're, they're kind of good reminder how much you love life actually.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:00.260
Yeah.

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.540
And you don't always remember that.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:04.500
Yeah.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:08.340
And, uh, I think having kids is not for everyone for absolutely, for sure.

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:11.660
But for me, and especially you shouldn't be having kids to give

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:12.900
yourself a reason to live.

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:15.220
I don't mean like, I feel like dying.

01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:15.980
I'm going to have a kid.

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.420
You might feel more like dying after having a kid, actually, you know,

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.460
it's pretty stressful.

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:26.060
Uh, but it is a place to like, I've changed a lot of people that I've known

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:32.140
that it gave them a new intensity of gratitude for life, for sure.

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:36.140
God, do you mind if we, I'll return to the pain of the believer.

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.100
You mind if we listen to a little bit of songs?

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:43.820
Did you write the music first or the words first?

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.700
Uh, it's same time, which is very typical for me.

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:53.420
By the way, just the way it opens, like how, you know, intensity of openings.

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:56.500
You ever think about like what the first few seconds sound like?

01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:01.540
Is that something that, um, like when you imagine a song, is it the opening you

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.100
imagine?

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:07.340
No, it's, it's kind of a, it's just a, I never think opening.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.180
I never think.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:12.620
Final, I think soundscape of how I'm feeling right now.

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:15.980
So it could be the middle of the song for all I know when I'm, you know,

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:17.100
when I'm, when I'm doing that.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:23.020
But my process for me is very much lyrics and melody and music really

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.220
come at the same time.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:31.540
Like I, by same time, I mean, I'm, I'm, uh, as I'm expressing, maybe, you

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.220
know, I'm feeling like.

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.460
Like it's not that simple, but it's like, I'll, I'll hear it.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.900
Like, it's like, here's all the orchestra and you're kind of just

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.140
pressing all the buttons at once.

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:43.140
And melody and my voice is just one of those instruments.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:43.740
You know what I mean?

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:45.100
It's just utilizing one instrument.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.780
So you've seen the landscape and that landscape includes melody, includes

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.780
percussion lyrics a little bit or lyrics.

01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:56.300
We're, uh, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're,

01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:00.780
we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're,

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:04.980
or lyrics where I will be words to begin with, like a word here and there.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.820
Like, I'll be like, believe it.

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:14.020
You know, I'm like, what's a word that I'm thinking of when I'm feeling this

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:21.220
soundscape and I always create with no theme in mind, I'm never for, for better

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:25.780
or for worse, just my process is I'm sitting down and I'm writing a journal

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.180
entry, simple as that.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.660
It's like, when you sit down to write a journal entry, are you sitting down

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:33.900
and you're like, Kev had all these words here that I'm going to put on the page

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:35.180
and I'm going to order it in this way.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.180
And my theme for my journal entry today is going to be this.

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.300
Maybe some people do, but I don't.

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.620
My journal entry is, I don't know what I'm going to say.

01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:42.980
Oh, how was today?

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.420
Well, man, today was this and feeling this.

01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:47.340
And now that I think about that, I'm really angry about that.

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.820
That hurt my feelings when this, you're like, you're formulating it as you go.

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:52.980
And that's the joy of it.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.620
And for me, that's what music is.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:58.900
So I'll sit down, not thinking, Hey, I've been wanting to write a

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.420
song that has a hard beat.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.780
Or I've been wanting to write a song that's anthemic or I've been wanting to

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:05.980
write a song that's it's like, how am I feeling right now?

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.020
And it's joyful.

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.340
Would there is the feeling joyful to you or is it struggle?

01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:17.340
It's not, you just made it sound like it's, I think, uh, or at least fulfilling.

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:17.940
Yeah.

01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:21.020
Fulfilling is the word I was kind of looking for, but there was a lot of

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:25.140
artists talk about really strong, like you talk about writers, cathartic.

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.100
That's the word I was looking at.

01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:32.620
It feels like having a good moment with a therapist where you're like, okay,

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:37.180
I'm expressing this thing that I just need to express for whatever reason.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.500
I need to express this.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:41.340
The majority of the songs I write for the record are never heard.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.740
I write over a hundred songs a year.

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:47.540
I release 20 songs every three years.

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:49.060
So I don't know.

01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:49.740
What's that percent?

01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.740
20 out of 300.

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:51.380
Come on.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.580
I, it's less than 10%.

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:03.660
Anyway, so it's, and then like getting together with the band and like getting

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.540
them selected down as really what the process have.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:14.900
So you're really writing a song per one to three days, kind of maybe a song

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:18.460
that you can't quite figure out the puzzle of that's going to last a little,

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:19.460
a little longer.

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:21.980
Is it worth every idea?

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:22.340
Yeah.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.900
You finish every idea.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:24.100
I do.

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.100
I finish every idea.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.740
It's not just like laying completely unfinished.

01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:32.300
I could open my computer for you right now and I would show you hundreds and

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:36.380
hundreds of songs that you would listen to and think that sounds like a song.

01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:39.460
It's like, there's rhythm, there's melody, there's multiple instruments,

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:45.300
there's lyrics, like I, it's the same thing is, is for coding for me, which is

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:48.540
music, which is, I can't walk away until I've completed it.

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.500
But it's finished.

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.060
My way.

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:55.740
Well, finished is, I certainly do a lot more with it after with the band.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.020
We'll pull it all apart, but it's a song.

01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:01.060
It'll be like, you know, it's, you'll listen to it and say, okay, that was a

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:05.740
song I get, you understand what, what it is for sure.

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:10.860
Do you think, this is a painful question from a fan perspective, do you think

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:18.260
there's genius on your computer that you walked away from that you just didn't

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:22.580
notice it, like, do you think there's truly great songs that you've written

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:26.780
that you just didn't notice how great they are?

01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:33.300
I think greatness is something that I feel I'm, I'm, I don't feel like

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.100
I've achieved greatness, genuine.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.820
I'm not saying that to you in a way of like humility.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.100
It's like Michael Jordan time.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:46.380
No, genuinely, I feel like I am on a journey right now to find who I am and

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:50.780
I'm 34 and it's like, I don't even, I haven't begun that journey.

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.060
I feel like I'm just starting that.

01:22:52.900 --> 01:23:01.300
But that being said, I certainly don't know the right answer to what songs are,

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:04.060
you know, beloved or good to the masses.

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:06.540
Like imagine dragons is such a massive entity.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:10.900
It's like, there have been, I will say this, there are a couple of times where

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:16.180
I fought really hard to decide on the single, really hard, or I always fight

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:17.820
for what goes on the record, always.

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.740
I always put the record together and that's the record that I want it to be.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:23.860
And me and the guys come up with that and it's nobody else has influence,

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:26.500
no manager, no label, the single.

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:30.580
Everybody wants to have a say in your label, wants to have a say in it.

01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:31.860
Your manager wants to have a say in it.

01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:36.140
And I have fought really hard over that and I've been wrong before

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:36.980
and I've been right before.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:41.940
Um, but as far as songs that I haven't put out, I mean,

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.900
cause you can imagine so many songs you think.

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:49.340
You think of so many Beatles songs that are like some of their grays

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:51.020
while my guitar gently weeps.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:56.420
I let me, I'm trying to imagine weird sounding, not that interesting,

01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:57.700
possibly songs that turn

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:03.220
honestly, they may, it may be our best stuff is that we don't put out for

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:09.860
instance, because our band is such a, it's such a complex question.

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:10.620
I really don't know.

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:11.620
Actually, I don't know.

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.380
Maybe one day I'll die and people will look and be like, I hate it.

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:15.100
Imagine dragons.

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.700
But now listen, that's not, I really liked that.

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.420
Wish they would put that out or maybe they'll be like, Oh,

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.300
it's all sounds like shit.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.020
I don't really know.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.340
Um,

01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.980
well, that's, that's sorry.

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:24.380
It is a tragic thing.

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:30.620
That's why I asked it, which is like, it could be some great, incredible

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:35.540
things that, that will take you a long time to rediscover, to

01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.740
realize how great they are.

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:41.340
And it's, that's, it's also the tragic aspect of being an artist is you

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.940
don't know, forget fame or all that kind of stuff.

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.900
You don't know what's going to really move people.

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:51.500
Cause ultimately what you want is to, to connect with people and you

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:52.860
don't know what that's going to be.

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:54.700
It's hard.

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.900
I mean, to me, it's, to me, it's tragic just as a fan of yours to see, maybe I

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:03.460
wonder if there's like incredible stuff there, just as it is tragic to see great

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:06.260
artists throughout history who didn't get recognition until they died.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:12.020
It's like, cause they basically held on, you know, uh, Franz Kafka was

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:13.300
extremely self-critical.

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:18.460
A lot of these folks had an idea of what's good and not, and they were wrong.

01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:21.460
There was gene, they had genius.

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.780
They weren't entirely wrong because they became sufficiently

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.740
popular, but it's interesting.

01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:31.020
I tried to genuinely to release the songs that move me the most.

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:31.420
Got it.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.780
I'll say that you're an audience.

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:33.860
You're your own audience.

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:34.100
Yeah.

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:38.660
I try to put out the songs that make me feel the most.

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:44.220
Like I feel, I feel that that's my only gauge because it's so subjective

01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:45.380
of like, what is good?

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.700
What's the, nobody knows the song.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.940
The masses are going to like, nobody knows that formula.

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:50.660
Nobody knows it.

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.980
So for me, it's always what makes me feel something.

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:55.780
One of the main lessons Rick Rubin taught me when we worked with him on this

01:25:55.780 --> 01:26:01.900
record was he would say he would, his, his main point that he would continually

01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:05.260
bring up like, cause he's not, he's not the type of person to be like, that's

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.620
a bad song or that's good.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.740
It's just not who Rick Rubin is.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.700
It's more like, there's more nuance to it.

01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:14.380
He would say, I don't really believe you on that song.

01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:16.860
That's what he would, he would say.

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:20.820
He would say, and I knew that was like, that song's a no go.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:24.180
He would say, and I, and I would genuinely, there was a time he said it

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:28.300
and it was about a song that I really, like, I really felt it and meant it when

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:33.020
I said it, but he didn't believe it when he heard it and I was enough for, I was

01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:36.620
like, man, well, at the end of the day, like I can believe it all I want, but if

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:40.060
the listener doesn't feel the honesty in it, just like we were talking about

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:44.020
earlier, I think the most important ingredient is, is this truth perceived

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.820
as truth to someone else?

01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:48.700
And if it's not the bullshit indicator goes and you're like, I don't care.

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:49.700
I don't throw it away.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.260
I don't care about it.

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:56.260
Well, he, you said that he made you go through like line by line, the lyrics.

01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.460
Every single, that was excruciating for me.

01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:02.060
Why was that excruciating?

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:03.700
Well, first of all, it's Rick Rubin.

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:07.260
So you're in the room with like Rick Rubin, who's done a lot of

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.020
the greatest of all time.

01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:14.420
And, um, so I had to first just put that aside and be like, okay, well, you've

01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:18.380
done a lot of my favorite records, but still you're, you're human and not

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.540
everything you say is going to be right.

01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.780
You know, I, and I'm a strongly opinionated person and so is Rick.

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:26.820
And so when the two of us were sitting in a room together, it was, you know,

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:30.100
um, but the lyrics, which is interesting.

01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:34.180
So it's not, not the entire composition, but just like, let's look at the lyrics.

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:34.900
What do you mean here?

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:35.580
Yeah.

01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:36.060
Oh yeah.

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:41.060
Cause he would look over every, there was like, um, and there was, there

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:45.660
were battles he won battles that, that, that he didn't win and maybe he was right.

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:46.100
I don't know.

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.060
I mean, there was, for instance, I'll give you a example.

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.660
There was a song on the record called number one.

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:52.100
Rick will probably laugh when he hears this.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:57.540
Um, cause this was a big one that we kept going back and forth on, but this will

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:00.700
give you a good insight of what it's, what it was like, what it was like.

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.780
And there's a line in it that says, um, I don't know the courses.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.140
I don't know what I meant to be.

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:10.060
I don't need no one to believe when it's all been said and done.

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.860
I'm still my number one.

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:15.020
And he was like, nah, it just makes me cringe when I hear that.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.380
He's like, I just like, do you have to be like, can it not be

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:21.780
like you're still my number one?

01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:23.420
I was like, no, it's not about anybody else.

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:25.500
Like, you know, it's about like self-love.

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:29.340
He's like, yeah, but like, do you need to like talk about self-love like that?

01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:32.860
And I was like, well, I can't, I feel like I need to, but you know,

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.220
there's something else we could say there.

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:37.380
Like we just kept, you know, we kept coming back to this song.

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:37.740
Okay.

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.220
I was like, I, and I changed it.

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:41.500
I tried changing it.

01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:42.500
What did I change it to?

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500
It was like, it wasn't, you're still my number one.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:45.540
Cause it just made no sense.

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:48.700
It wasn't about some love thing or like someone else.

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:53.140
I changed it to something else and it just, it was the one thing that I was

01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:58.100
like, I'm really sorry, Rick, like I get it and if it sounds cringy to you,

01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.700
it's definitely sounding cringy to other people too.

01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.300
And that sucks.

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:04.180
But I don't know how else to say this in a way that I want to put that song

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:09.100
out anymore, but there were other songs for sure, where Rick was like that or

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:11.900
this, that word feels a little trite.

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:12.980
You already said that once.

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.260
Can you say it in a different way?

01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:15.460
That was really helpful.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:19.140
And then, yeah, it's really interesting because, uh, you're trying to say

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:24.820
something so simply and yet not make it cringe and that's really hard.

01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:29.100
That's, that's like a, that's a strange art form because you want to say some

01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:33.140
of the greatest law songs we, I mean, we looked at the, the without you song.

01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:35.180
I mean, that's the whole thing is cringy.

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:40.220
If you just read it on paper, like it's a, like it's a court

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:43.060
report or something, but yet it's not.

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:49.060
Especially one song maybe, but no, there's something about, yeah, maybe

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:53.300
sung in a way you believe it when you believe it, but also written in a way

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:56.020
that's singable in the way you believe it.

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:56.700
So it's like,

01:29:58.820 --> 01:29:59.900
and then it rolls off.

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:03.420
It just comes out in a way that just feels like silky and no word

01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:05.780
catches your mind is cringy.

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:06.460
Yes.

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:12.700
This just, uh, but then music, um, I think great speeches are

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:18.620
like that too, or just, you know, conveying, communicating ideas simply.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.420
That's the, that's the art form is to not be cringy.

01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:23.220
So interesting.

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:30.260
And then you, cause like when you're raw and real, it might have

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:36.340
first feel cringy so that the battle there and that that's where.

01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:41.540
You see people fail, like just regular artists, like, um, I don't

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:42.980
open at open mic.

01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:43.700
I've got open mic.

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.700
So I just listen to musicians.

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:48.260
Like when they write songs, like they, they fail that test.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.580
They write simple stuff, but it's cringy.

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:51.300
Why?

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.500
I wonder what was that?

01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:53.220
Like, what is that?

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:56.300
I'm telling you, like, I tried to explain this to my brother the other day.

01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:59.900
Cause it's the same thing with a live performance.

01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:05.060
If I'm not in my right head space and I walk on stage and I walk up and let's

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:06.500
say I say something and I do this.

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:08.140
Yeah.

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.100
Hey, cause I'm like, this is the move, right?

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:11.340
I'm like, this is the move.

01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.020
The crowd doesn't care.

01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:16.100
In fact, the crowd's like, that's cringing when you did this.

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:21.140
But if I wasn't thinking about doing this and I went up there and I said

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:25.260
something and I really meant it in my body was like, I can't explain this

01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:31.580
to you and it's so silly to say out loud, but it's people will resonate

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:35.660
to it when it's real and when it's acted, it doesn't, you could do it the

01:31:35.660 --> 01:31:37.660
exact, the motion could look the same.

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:40.900
Your eyes look the same, but there's something about the energy.

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:43.820
That people know they know if it's real or not.

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:44.060
Yeah.

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.700
People have, like you said, incredible bullshit detectors.

01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:47.620
That's 100%.

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:50.420
I'll go on a stage and if I'm not in the right head space to be

01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.460
real, it won't be a good show.

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.340
If I'm real, then it's a good show.

01:31:54.340 --> 01:31:55.100
It's as simple as that.

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.380
Let's go through the song.

01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.580
Like I said, great opener.

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.860
So you had this in your mind, this landscape.

01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:04.220
Yeah.

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:04.420
Yeah.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:04.820
Yeah.

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:12.700
The beat was first on this.

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:16.100
What about the first and the second and third?

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:17.420
Like first things first.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.500
The first line I wrote was first things first.

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:24.820
I don't know why it just was like, and then I was like, Oh, that principle.

01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:27.900
Get great line.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:30.140
Don't second thing second.

01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:32.820
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be.

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:34.660
I'm the one at the sale.

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:35.820
I'm the master of my seat.

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:37.260
I'm the master of my seat.

01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.100
Such a dad had that in his office.

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:45.100
He had this saying that was something about the sailor and being the master

01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:46.900
of his seat that I always loved.

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:48.340
There you go.

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:49.500
Simple statement.

01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:50.020
Yeah.

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.100
Zero cringing it.

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.860
It's so powerful.

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:54.380
It's so simple.

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:56.220
I'm the master of my seat.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:58.940
This whole song is just trivial.

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:06.860
But in terms of lyrically, but extremely powerful and original, unique sounding,

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:10.020
something about the words, just even, you don't have to actually sing them.

01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:10.900
You just read them.

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.340
And then, and then raw.

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:16.660
I was broken from a young age, tuck myself into the masses, writing my

01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:21.020
poems for the few that look at me, took, took to me, shook at me, feeling me

01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:24.500
singing from the heartache, from the pain, taking my message from the vein.

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.180
I can't, why am I reciting your words to you?

01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:33.260
But the, the, the, the, the percussionist throughout it, the, uh, and, and that,

01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:34.300
that was there in the beginning.

01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:35.860
Percussion is almost in the lyrics.

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:36.180
Yeah.

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:40.820
And I'm a very percussive singer because, um, I was a drummer first before I, I

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:46.020
think same with Dave Grohl, probably a similar thing, which is I think in

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:49.260
percussive, uh, sense a lot when I'm writing.

01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:53.660
Cause I, and I also was before I could play an instrument, I would beat box.

01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:55.620
And I think Michael Jackson did this too.

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:59.220
Actually, I've heard in the studio that he was very similar, but a lot of what I

01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:08.100
do is percussive, um, cause my brain thinks in it percussively first a little

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:15.780
more, cause it's almost like a drum, like, and then you lay words on that.

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:17.980
Yeah.

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:19.100
Yeah.

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:23.300
This building.

01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:25.900
It's almost like drums.

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:32.100
It's all building to the chorus.

01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.140
What about the word pain?

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:46.340
When did that come to you?

01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:51.260
Um, pain, you made me, you made me a believer.

01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:58.100
Yeah, I just, the idea of, um, I just wanted to, I really, one of the things

01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:04.980
that a lot of the songs that I like, I like divisiveness for instance, not

01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:07.820
always, but there's times where I want someone to hear a song and I want them

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.100
to either love it or hate it.

01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:11.100
I really don't want them to be in the middle ground.

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:18.100
A lot of the songs that like a lot of my favorite songs are divisive songs.

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:23.780
Um, and so for instance, with pain, I want it, I want you to hear that in

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:26.820
almost like, it's like, Whoa, you know what I mean?

01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:29.460
And it's, it's, uh, it's something either somebody is going to hear in there

01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:31.460
and be like, man, I just don't want to hear that like that.

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:34.340
Or it's like, Oh, I felt that so deeply when he said that in that way,

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.660
because it sounded like this.

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:40.580
And, and when you think of the word pain, it's like, that's a, that's a, that's

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:46.420
a, when I, at least for me, when I hear that word, I, it carries a lot of

01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.100
weight, carries a lot of weight.

01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:51.700
So I wanted to sing it with a lot of weight and to come into that chorus

01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:54.940
with like, like, it's a striking moment.

01:35:55.580 --> 01:36:00.460
Um, and I'm also a tenor singing as, sorry, I'm a baritone singing as a tenor.

01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:05.860
So that's where that natural like gruffness comes from is that I'm singing

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:09.700
out of my range, really up in my head voice, and it carries a lot of weight

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:11.140
with it because of the baritone.

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:15.780
Can I ask you a specific sort of the pause before the pain?

01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:18.460
It's really interesting.

01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:19.420
Cause it's like a double.

01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:25.900
What is that?

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.140
Is that how much work does that take to get that right?

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:32.980
That's, that's incredible because it's like, so you're seeing the beauty

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:36.420
through the, and then that whatever that sound is the

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:36.820
Right.

01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:37.980
The bass being rolled off.

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:38.180
Yeah.

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:39.220
Yeah.

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:39.660
Yeah.

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:43.860
I actually, when I first, uh, was approaching the chorus, it was actually

01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.700
singing, uh, took me through the missing of a heartache from the pain, taking

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:50.460
my message from the vein, speaking my lesson from the vein, seeing the beauty

01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:54.940
through the, uh, seeing the beauty through the pain, you made me a you.

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.180
Like it came in on one.

01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:01.740
I'm not singing it right right now, but it, it did not wait and it felt like

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:06.060
it didn't hit in the way that it was supposed to hit because the, the, uh,

01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:07.260
you predict that, right?

01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:10.020
You're like, you're waiting to see the beauty through the pain.

01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:11.060
You made me a right.

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.260
It was like the beauty through the pain.

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.500
You made me a maybe.

01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:17.660
So I wanted to feel a little more like striking.

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.900
Like, again, it's like that thing that makes you kind of do this a little bit.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:21.740
You're like, huh?

01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:25.820
But once you hear it a few times, you're like, ah, ah, and you predict, you

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.260
know what I mean?

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:30.100
It's like, I'd rather someone hear our song the first time and be confused by

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:32.540
it, so they play it the second time.

01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:34.340
And then they're like, oh, okay.

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:34.860
You know what I mean?

01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:41.260
Like, I really don't want, you know, I'd rather turn some people off along the

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:46.100
way and then the people who come along for you are going to feel more committed.

01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:52.500
I think it's just an interesting, like, it feels gutsy to insert silence, you

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:56.100
know, that's what it makes it, you know, it's like the greatest speakers of all

01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.500
time are like, and I told you, right.

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:05.780
You would know, you're like, oh, yeah, what is that?

01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:06.100
Yeah.

01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:08.900
That's so interesting to do that just at the right time.

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:12.260
And then pain, right?

01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:15.380
Man, it's a brilliant song.

01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:20.020
Did you know it was a good song when you wrote it out of the thousands of songs

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:20.340
you've written?

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:25.940
You know, it's always the same thing for me, which is like, if I want to listen to

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:30.660
the song and I want to listen to it a lot of times, then those are the songs we put

01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:35.060
out and I only want to listen to the songs that make me feel something, whether or

01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:40.180
not it's like our single that did the very worst of all our singles was the

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:44.420
song that I wanted to listen to the least, but it made the most sense as a

01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:46.580
single, which was all the wrong reason to choose it, right?

01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:49.740
It was this, it was a, I bet my life is the single off our second album.

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.740
And that song was originally written.

01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:55.660
It was just a guitar and a vocal, and it was very just quiet and laid back.

01:38:56.220 --> 01:38:59.060
And we were like, well, let's try to dial it up.

01:38:59.060 --> 01:38:59.940
Let's try to produce it.

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.500
And we overproduced that song.

01:39:01.860 --> 01:39:04.580
We self-produced it as a band and we overproduced.

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:10.860
And that song, I mean, it's, it did good, you know, in terms of a song, but for us,

01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:14.140
it did not do good, um, compared to other songs.

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:17.140
And I really look back at that and learned a lesson from that.

01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:19.300
It's like, I don't want to listen to the song.

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.580
That's a sign already.

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:24.860
If you don't want to listen to your own song, it's probably not a good song.

01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:33.580
You said your dad, um, elsewhere in today just said that your dad early on was a

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:37.020
kind of, uh, the early Rick Rubin.

01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:41.820
So when you were starting out, he was, um, he gave you feedback.

01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.500
He listened.

01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:46.820
Um, what did you learn about music, about life from your dad?

01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:51.260
My dad is a really quiet farm.

01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:52.300
Grew up on a farm.

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.100
Very humble.

01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:02.540
Um, I think he starts every sentence by saying, this is just my two cents pretty

01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:03.260
much, you know what I mean?

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:05.180
It's like, he's like, take it or leave it.

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:05.980
Like, you know what I mean?

01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:09.020
He's that, that kind of a sense, like there's humility in everything.

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:09.980
And it's real for him.

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:11.860
It's not like false humility.

01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:15.380
He really, I really feel like when he's saying things, he really is like, maybe

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.140
this isn't any worth to you son.

01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:19.380
And he means it, but here it is.

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.220
And it's always gold.

01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:21.500
And I'm like, wow, dad, that's incredible.

01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:25.900
You know, so what in those early days of you, like, so you were like 12 or

01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:30.060
something like that, like starting to write 12, I wasn't showing my music to anyone.

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.300
I started writing right when I was 12 and I probably wrote for at least, let's

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:34.380
say six months or something.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:38.540
And I had written probably, I don't know, like a lot of songs during that.

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:39.580
What was the topic by the way?

01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:40.180
Love?

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:41.940
It was all sad.

01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.860
No, it was the first song I ever wrote went.

01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:54.340
And it was like a bluesy thing.

01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.740
It was like, there was my voice doing that.

01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:56.100
And then it was like.

01:40:56.700 --> 01:41:04.260
All by himself, no other one around and he stood all alone.

01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:07.740
When would he be found?

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:13.100
Did he want company or was he found on his own?

01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.780
Everyone needs a friend.

01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:19.580
So why was he all alone?

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:27.900
You know, it is like, but I was like a 12 year old with, I just felt like depressed

01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:32.780
for the first time and I was, and I just was like, so you discovered the blues as

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:36.940
a 12 year old, it really was like my sense of the blues at that time, for sure.

01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:40.980
Like bad version of the blues, but it was like 12 year old kid with a bunch of acne.

01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:43.940
And like, I just like, I hated going to school.

01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:49.060
I felt like I just had not found myself a great song by the way, but I wanted to

01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:55.180
keep listening, I forgot I was, I don't know about that, but yeah.

01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:58.580
What was your dad, at which point did you begin to share it with your dad?

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.740
A lot of the songs that I wrote in the beginning were very much like Bobby McFerrin

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:05.820
like that because we are, Mike was in a part of the house where I couldn't bring

01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:08.460
over the piano and the only instrument I played at the time was the piano.

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:12.180
So I would do everything with my voice, but then I started teaching myself the

01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:15.780
guitar in those, in that beginning, like six month period, just watching my

01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:18.020
brothers play in their garage bands in the, in the basement.

01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:20.860
And then I started to write songs a little more, more like Enya vibes, like

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:22.940
stack my voice, like 20, 30 times.

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:28.020
And like Enya meets like Jare, which is who my dad would listen to a lot.

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:33.180
John, John Michael Jare, this incredible synth genius, but anyway, so I finally

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:38.460
got my, my like gall up enough to show it to my dad one day after work.

01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:41.460
And I got very little of my dad cause there were nine kids and he worked

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.860
from 8 AM till 6 PM.

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:47.100
We'll come home very tired and here's nine kids that are like, dad, you know,

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:48.380
and you're the young one.

01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:50.940
You're not, you're just going to miss, I was in the middle kind of too.

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:54.740
So it's even, you know, middle child thing, but I sat him down and I was like,

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:57.380
Hey dad, I just want to like, can I show you a song?

01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:00.540
And he was like, Oh, you know, he didn't know I was writing anything.

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:04.260
And I showed it to him and he listened and he took it off and he really looked

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.620
at me and was like, that was really good.

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:10.180
He was like, I really, I thought, and this, when you said this, it made me feel

01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:11.900
this, he was like, and that did it.

01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.020
I probably would have given up music.

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:16.980
Like I look back, that was a very pivotal moment for me.

01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:20.860
I was like in a place where I was like, is this good or bad?

01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:21.500
I don't know.

01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.460
Maybe it's so embarrassing and terrible.

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:27.060
And I was already writing lyrics that were a little like overly metaphorical

01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:29.100
to hide that I was dealing with faith crisis.

01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:30.980
Cause I thought, okay, I'm going to show this to dad.

01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:33.420
I don't want my dad to know I'm like questioning the

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:34.940
truthfulness of Joseph Smith.

01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:38.500
I'm not going to be like, is Joseph Smith a real prophet?

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:39.700
Is Mormonism true?

01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:40.540
I don't really know.

01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:41.180
Like, you know what I mean?

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:45.100
I was like writing way overly metaphorical, but because my dad really

01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.540
validated it and he was a no bullshit person.

01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:50.700
So I knew when my dad said that I was like, you know what, at least my dad

01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.180
really actually thinks this is cool.

01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:56.780
And I really trusted my dad's taste and thought everything he listened to was cool.

01:43:56.780 --> 01:43:59.060
So I was like, wow, I'm gonna keep doing this.

01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.860
And I just showed it to my dad for years and years and still to this day, I

01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:02.940
send every song to my dad.

01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:07.420
So he underneath it with the feedback is always like, Ooh, I like this idea.

01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:07.860
I like this.

01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:11.500
This is a positive, like a not always positive, but like underneath it.

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:12.900
Do you sense the positivity?

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:14.340
Cause I think that's always.

01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:18.220
Never, never mean, never malicious.

01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:21.380
Uh, you know, there's like, there's two types of criticism.

01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:22.260
There's like criticism.

01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:24.620
That's just like, you're looking to be hurtful to someone.

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:25.620
And then there's criticism.

01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:27.860
That's like really important for art.

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:32.420
It's the type of criticism that's like, you see the value and what's happening.

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:35.940
And if it's honest, then you can, you maybe communicate with that person.

01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:39.140
Like I S I see what you're trying to do with that.

01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:41.980
You know, it's not even like you have to say that or whatever, like butter it up.

01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:46.780
But it's like, my dad would just give me the, this honest criticism that would be

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:52.660
like, uh, you know, it certainly wasn't always good, but I knew it was always

01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:54.940
well-intentioned, I guess that's, that's how I would say.

01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:57.020
So you mentioned, made me re-listen to it.

01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:58.580
I I'm a big fan of cast Stevens.

01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:00.340
You made me re-listen to father and son.

01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:05.540
Um, I probably all sons have issues to work through with their fathers.

01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:10.100
Um, let's just, and you said that you connect with this song in particular.

01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:12.660
I think, uh, so you're a father now.

01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:16.660
Uh, what is it about the song that connects with you for people?

01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:17.980
Let me play it.

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:19.140
Let me play a little bit.

01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.700
People should educate themselves on cast Stevens.

01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:22.460
Oh my gosh.

01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.420
Right on the peace train.

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:26.020
The best piece, right on the peace train.

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:28.940
You think this is a hopeful, a sad song?

01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:30.980
I hear it as hopeful.

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:34.540
I hear it as a loving father saying just what his son needs to hear.

01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:37.740
It's not time to make a change.

01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:41.180
Just relax, take it easy.

01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:43.300
You're still young.

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:44.980
That's your fault.

01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:47.580
There's so much you have.

01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:49.180
It's like that calm wisdom.

01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:50.780
Yeah.

01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:51.540
There's time.

01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:52.740
It wise.

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:57.660
If you want, you can marry, look at me.

01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:01.260
I am old, but I'm happy.

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:03.180
And just the way he says that, like that should be a corny line,

01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:04.220
but it's not corny at all.

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:07.500
It's like, yeah, look at me.

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:08.940
I'm old, but I'm happy.

01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:16.060
Yeah.

01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:20.500
I mean the simplicity there and it, yeah, but it's such a contrast

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:22.980
with, um, what's his name?

01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:32.260
Um, Harry Chapman with the cats in the cradle, uh, which is like the sadness

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:40.660
of the, this feels like there's a, a wise, calm connection between father

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:44.420
and son, right with, uh, with cats in the cradle.

01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:45.860
I don't know if you remember that song.

01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:51.820
Um, he learned to walk while I was away and he was talking before I knew it.

01:46:51.860 --> 01:46:54.780
And as he grew, he'd say, I'm going to be like you, dad, you

01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:55.980
know, I'm going to be like you.

01:46:55.980 --> 01:47:00.100
And the idea of that song is that he does become like his dad.

01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:05.100
It's just funny, you know, something you've said, uh, but in a different

01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:08.260
way, you become too busy to make that connection.

01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:12.220
His dad was too busy to make a connection with his son in a, in a

01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:15.460
non-dramatic way, in a very kind of calm, natural way.

01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:17.180
Like, you don't, you just don't have time.

01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:21.420
Uh, you're, you're busy at work, you're providing for the family and so on.

01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:24.980
There's connection, but if you don't really get formed that like depth of

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:30.580
connection, and, uh, then the father, when, uh, when the son shows up from

01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:33.220
college and all that kind of stuff, he doesn't spend any time with the father.

01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:39.220
He all that, and just the calm sadness of that, that we, we live, we can

01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:41.540
live parallel lives and never quite connect.

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:45.180
And there is a little bit of that in father and son with Kat Stevens too.

01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:49.260
You know, like when the, when the son is saying, um, from the moment that I

01:47:49.260 --> 01:47:50.780
could talk, I was ordered to listen.

01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:56.020
I always, I always remember listening to that line feeling like that really

01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:00.420
moved me, but the beauty of that song is it shows it's kind of like the

01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:03.500
theme of what I feel like we've talked about since the second you got here,

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:06.500
which is something I really like, I don't know why it's such an important theme

01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:11.980
in my life right now, but the duality of just understanding that you don't

01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:13.940
understand someone else's situation.

01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:16.140
And there's truth to both sides.

01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:19.020
Like there's truth to what the father is saying to the son.

01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:21.860
He's like saying these things and he's like, I'm looking out for you.

01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:22.980
I love you.

01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:24.460
Take your time with these things.

01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:26.860
If you want to get married, you can, like these things will bring up.

01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:31.180
And then the son saying, listen, like I want to pave my own path.

01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:31.980
I want to do this.

01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.260
Like, why are you telling me this?

01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:37.340
Like the son's not wrong because there's a lot of parents who tell their

01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:38.340
kids what to do and they're wrong.

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:40.140
Then that, you know what I mean?

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:46.420
Like, and they don't let the kid form the path that they need to, but should

01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:48.820
you not be a parent, like, you know, there's just two sides to it.

01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:56.780
There's a thing, it is annoying when you're older, you get to see people

01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:05.420
do all the same things and you could say, well, this is a phase and you'll

01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:08.180
see that this actually will end up in this way.

01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:10.180
You can like predict how the life unrolls.

01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:12.860
And it's very annoying for young people to hear, especially because

01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:13.980
it's probably going to be true.

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:15.940
It's like, no, it's not going to be like this.

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.220
No, I'm going to be different.

01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:21.340
But then you become that person, but that doesn't mean they also let them

01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:25.780
live that life, let them make the mistakes, but they're not mistakes.

01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:32.260
Actually, they're, they're like beautiful deviations from the, from

01:49:32.260 --> 01:49:34.060
the path that they end up on.

01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:36.460
And those, those, those make the path.

01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:42.740
Um, do you have advice for young folks today?

01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:50.820
You've had like an incredible dark journey and a successful one, a loving

01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:56.500
one, and one of the most successful artists in the world, is there advice

01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:00.660
you can give to young people today that would like to find themselves through

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.260
that way, especially if they're struggling?

01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:03.980
I thought you said device at first.

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:07.620
And I was like, honestly, I feel like that device is not helping.

01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:11.900
Maybe we should get away, throw away their devices.

01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:23.460
Um, advice, um, I would just say like, what I emphasize to my kids is I really,

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:26.380
really want my kids to just learn to love themself.

01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:29.020
It's easier said than done.

01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:32.060
It's really easy to pick on yourself in life.

01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:37.060
It's really easy to look in the mirror and wish you looked different.

01:50:37.460 --> 01:50:40.900
Wish you were more successful like that person over there.

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:48.420
Wish that, you know, wish a lot of things and people that I see that

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:53.500
really succeed at life really succeed truly.

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:56.540
And that doesn't mean they're making money necessarily or they're succeeding.

01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:59.860
And, you know, they're talking to a lot of people like their success.

01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:04.540
Success to me is like happy and real.

01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:06.060
They have real self-love.

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:08.660
You meet, you know, when you meet someone, you meet Rick, for

01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:09.780
instance, you meet Rick Rubin.

01:51:10.620 --> 01:51:12.140
Rick has a calmness about him.

01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:16.380
And it's funny cause everybody sees him as this like Zen master.

01:51:16.380 --> 01:51:23.740
Like Rick is just a really loving person who also loves himself and

01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:26.860
has self-confidence because you just see it and it resonates.

01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:27.980
And that's why he draws people.

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:30.780
And that's why he's so great in the studio because you know his intentions.

01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:34.220
Always as an artist, when a producer comes in, you're like, whoa, whoa,

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:35.500
whoa, what are your intentions?

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:36.700
What are you trying to do?

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:38.380
Are you trying to get a hit out of me for the label?

01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:41.260
Or you're trying to make me something or you're trying to like make me this.

01:51:41.260 --> 01:51:42.580
So you can prove this about yourself.

01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:44.700
Like there's a lot in that dynamic.

01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:49.660
And the reason that Rick is so good is because you know his intentions and his

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.940
intentions come because Rick has that self-love.

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:57.900
So for me, find the things about yourself cause they're there that you

01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:01.180
love and really focus in on them.

01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:02.660
And it's not selfish.

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:07.700
Like I feel like I was brought up in a family too, where it was like never

01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:11.940
look inward, like be selfless, like serve, serve, serve, which by the way,

01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.180
is a true principle of life.

01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:16.300
I think you love yourself more when you serve more.

01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:20.980
I think that's really evident in life, but also spend time doing the

01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:22.580
things that make you happy.

01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:26.220
Take time every day to go on that walk that you need to go on, listen to that

01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:27.740
book tape that you need to listen to.

01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:29.900
Like for me, that's something I need.

01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:33.820
I know if I do that, I'm going to be a better dad because I did, I did, I gave

01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:36.140
myself some, some love back in life.

01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:39.420
And, and I just forgive yourself.

01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:41.740
I think forgive yourself because everybody messes up.

01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:43.020
Everybody hurts others.

01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:45.180
Everybody says unkind words at times.

01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:49.260
Everybody, everybody fails all the time.

01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:53.340
And if you think that you're going to not, you're wrong and you're eventually

01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:56.740
going to, and you're either going to punish yourself for it every day and be

01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:00.460
a lesser version of what you could be, or you're going to forgive yourself for it.

01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:04.260
And if you learned that that's not something you want and try not to do it again, if

01:53:04.540 --> 01:53:07.980
you do it again and you're probably going to do it again, whatever that is, you're

01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:09.220
going to gossip about that person.

01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:11.420
You're going to feel bad because then you gossiped about someone.

01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:15.780
Is there something you could say in terms of self-love, is there a role for

01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:20.420
being critical on your, like that, that, those demons of like self-criticism?

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:21.740
Do you need a little bit of that?

01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:24.980
Tom Waits talks about, I like my town with a little drop of poison.

01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:25.300
Right.

01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:30.860
You need a little poison or is it, is that silly or a mental situation of poison?

01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:35.660
Look, it's my, my biggest thing in life that has been like the thing that I've

01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:39.980
worked on the hardest for the last few years is to not be overly critical.

01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:45.140
Um, and to let go of control.

01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:51.540
I think, um, it's really easy to kill an artist.

01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:54.820
It's really easy to kill an artist.

01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:59.300
Like if my dad would have sat down with me that day and even if he would have

01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.940
just sat down and then like, good job, son.

01:54:01.940 --> 01:54:02.180
Okay.

01:54:02.740 --> 01:54:03.580
It's not silly, right?

01:54:03.580 --> 01:54:06.620
Like I don't, I didn't, not everybody has a dad who's going to ever do

01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:12.300
something or put in the time or whatever, but that would, that might

01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:13.820
have altered everything for me.

01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:17.940
Like my dad taking the extra time to be, to just give me a thoughtful

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:21.580
response opposed to kids know kids know when you're, when you're just like

01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:22.860
trying to get out of the room or whatever.

01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:25.820
I knew he wasn't and that did a lot.

01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:30.700
So yeah, is that, is that a huge, isn't that what makes the artists?

01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:35.940
It's the fragility of it that like, uh, would you have it any other way?

01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:40.060
No, no, I, I, I agree with you.

01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:46.340
I think that that's what that, uh, that's the beauty of art, but I

01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:53.900
think also on the same token, it's like, I went to, I went to music cares

01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:57.820
recently, which is a charity for musicians that are down on their luck.

01:54:58.300 --> 01:55:01.100
That maybe we're successful at one point or I've never been successful and

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:05.020
they can't pay the bills and this charity contributes money to these

01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:08.780
artists, aspiring artists or artists who've had drug issues and like

01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:11.860
there's a lot that they do, but, and there was a statistic that they told

01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:16.260
it was staggering to me, which is, I think it was 75% of artists,

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:19.660
musicians say they struggle with severe depression.

01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:21.700
That's really high.

01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:26.100
I don't know what the national average is, but I would guess that that's

01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:28.300
higher than national average per occupation.

01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:32.540
So I just think there's a tricky balance.

01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:36.140
There's a tricky balance in, in art.

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:43.260
Um, so yeah, of course, like it's, it's a necessary thing, the fragility of it all.

01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:44.820
But, um,

01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:50.660
yeah, I wonder, because I'm extremely self critical and I sometimes ask

01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:58.700
myself the question I've romanticized it or rather I've learned to be, for it

01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:03.980
to be productive, to channel it into productivity, but I wonder if there's

01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:08.300
better ways to do that and I also wonder if it's eventually the thing that destroys

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:13.980
me, like if long-term, if it's a healthy thing, it might be useful when you're in

01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:21.900
sort of actively fighting the battles of the day, the, for me, it's engineering

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:26.340
challenges and all that kind of stuff, but then when you're sitting back and

01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:31.380
enjoying life with family and so on, is that going to be like, do you need to

01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:38.060
find that self love, like ability to kind of, um, silence the voice of

01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:39.140
criticism in your head?

01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:42.380
You know what I really, there's a good, you're making a good point.

01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:48.980
And I think that the middle ground is you need,

01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:55.060
you need self doubt to push you to be better.

01:56:55.900 --> 01:57:01.620
I do, I do believe that like, for instance, if I, if I believed I've

01:57:01.620 --> 01:57:04.740
hit my, like when you're like, is there a song on there that you think is genius?

01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:08.540
If I, if I think I've written a genius song ever, I think I'd probably stop.

01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:12.180
I think I'd be like, you know what, did it.

01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:16.140
I wrote, um, uh, what's that perfect song?

01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:21.260
Imagine.

01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:21.900
Imagine.

01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:22.020
Yeah.

01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:22.460
Okay.

01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:26.860
If I'd written imagine, I'd probably be like, that's it.

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:27.260
Did it.

01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:27.740
All right.

01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:28.900
Perfect song has been written.

01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:29.860
That's the best thing I'll ever do.

01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:30.500
Yeah.

01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:37.500
So the fact that, that there is like self criticism and criticism

01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:41.020
outside, I think is necessary a hundred, a hundred percent for sure.

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:41.820
It pushes you.

01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:42.700
It pushes you.

01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:43.340
It pushes you.

01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:50.100
It's just finding the right middle ground for that young aspiring artists to also

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:54.940
not feel squashed and to be heard and to love just to not even to feel squashed,

01:57:55.260 --> 01:58:00.260
just to love themself so that when they're in the room playing the song, they'll

01:58:00.260 --> 01:58:04.580
believe it because they believe themself, they love themself enough that they

01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:05.980
believe it and then they'll do great.

01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:08.980
And then the song will come out great and they'll do a great performance.

01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:16.260
I have to ask, it's one of the very interesting aspects of your life, of the,

01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:18.100
of the way you put love out there in the world.

01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:19.060
Uh, what is it?

01:58:19.060 --> 01:58:22.300
The core of your support for the LGBT community?

01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:24.580
Uh, a couple of things.

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:32.540
So one growing up in, from a young age in the artist community, a lot of my

01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:35.900
closest friends were LGBTQ starting in middle school.

01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:42.900
Um, and I think a lot of the best artists in the world are LGBTQ and that's

01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:47.460
just, it's not a secret, like it just is like the artist community is filled

01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:50.300
with lots of LGBTQ people.

01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:56.580
So I think being raised in that community in that my friends struggled

01:58:56.580 --> 01:59:05.660
with their faith and their sexuality really opened up my eyes to how

01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:07.620
incredibly hard that path is.

01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:11.620
For instance, okay, when I was in high school, there was someone who

01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:18.500
went in front of, uh, who was LGBTQ and was Mormon and felt like there

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:20.500
was not a place for them in the church.

01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:24.420
Uh, they felt like the path, you know, when, when you're being told that

01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:28.980
that's evil and you believe it because you believe in your faith and you

01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:33.100
feel like it's unchangeable, you're putting a kid in a situation where

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:35.940
there's really no good resolution.

01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:40.300
It's either be alone for the rest of your life or marry outside your sexual

01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:43.820
preference, which I don't want to marry a man, like if I was forced to marry

01:59:43.820 --> 01:59:48.780
a man, I'm like, I don't want to marry to a man because I'm heterosexual.

01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:53.820
So you're forcing a kid into a situation where it's very dangerous.

01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:56.660
Long story short, this kid went in front of the Las Vegas Mormon temple

01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:58.860
and shot himself, killed himself.

02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:01.500
That impacted our community.

02:00:01.860 --> 02:00:08.380
Like, and not just that, but it was like severe bullying to, to LGBTQ kids.

02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:10.420
In the nineties, it was especially different.

02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:13.780
Like there's still bullying, don't get me wrong, but man, like bullying

02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:16.340
in school, I don't really know actually what it's like in schools now.

02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:20.340
Maybe the bullying is just as bad as it was in the nineties, but there was

02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:27.460
like, it was like, I would hear all the time, like the F slur being slung out

02:00:27.460 --> 02:00:30.820
at people who were LGBTQ all the time.

02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:33.860
And I wasn't even LGBTQ.

02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:45.540
So I, you know, it's just seeing that, I think that every, um, any social

02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:48.180
justice issue takes all sides.

02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:50.220
It takes all pieces of the puzzle.

02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:53.780
If only the pieces of the puzzle contributed are from the side that

02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:56.860
is affected, I don't believe that we'll ever have resolution.

02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:00.060
We're doing a shit job and we need to do better.

02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:05.260
And that's just, uh, that's, that's the reality of it.

02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:08.380
So that was part of the reason I also have family who's LGBTQ.

02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:12.420
And, and, uh, it's just something that's been part of my, my path.

02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:15.580
And I, I feel like I'm, I'm a big believer in take the path that is

02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:18.940
presented to you, and this was just something that came up in my life a lot.

02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:22.060
When I met my wife, she was living with her two best friends who were LGBTQ,

02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:25.300
who really didn't want her to marry me because I was Mormon.

02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:28.460
And at the time it was prop eight, which was Mormons were fighting

02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:30.980
against LGBT gay marriage.

02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:36.100
And so that then they didn't come to our wedding and that

02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:37.380
really broke my wife's heart.

02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:41.820
Um, so it was just like, because Mormonism represented everything

02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:44.980
that, that was against, um, their community.

02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:48.140
So, so you felt you had to say something.

02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:51.740
Yeah, I felt like by not saying anything, I was saying everything.

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:58.180
I felt like by not speaking up and being like, Hey, Dan Reynolds is Mormon singer.

02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:00.500
Here's this new band magic dragons and they're Mormons.

02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:03.220
It was like, okay, well, what do Mormons represent?

02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:04.540
They represent prop eight.

02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:09.180
What does prop eight represent bigotry towards the LGBTQ community.

02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:09.980
So what do I do?

02:02:10.020 --> 02:02:10.340
Okay.

02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:12.980
I can speak in every interview and be like, well, that's not me.

02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:14.580
I don't believe that too.

02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:17.700
Or I could just be more active about it.

02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:20.940
And especially when it was affecting my family and friends throughout my entire

02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:24.340
life, it was like, all right, this seems like a path that you need to go down.

02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:29.740
So once we're sure it was a path that just presented itself through,

02:02:29.820 --> 02:02:30.700
through things in my life.

02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:35.300
So just on that topic, religion and God give a lot of meaning to a lot of people.

02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:42.940
It's it gives, um, tradition that brings people together, um, across the

02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:46.020
generations, but it also can hurt people.

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:49.740
What do you make about that tension?

02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:54.500
So source of meaning, but also source of pain for people.

02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:59.820
The reality is, at least to me, again, this is just my reality.

02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:02.900
I feel like I'm doing my dad's thing every time I'm talking to.

02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:05.620
I'm like, I don't really know, here's my two cents.

02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:06.820
You have become your father.

02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:07.060
Yeah.

02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:16.100
Um, the reality and it's my reality and it is the reality for sure is, um, there's,

02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:23.660
I think that religion has brought a lot of hurt and pain to a lot of people.

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:25.060
Absolutely.

02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:26.140
It has that.

02:03:26.140 --> 02:03:28.860
I don't think anybody can dispute that on it on either side.

02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:38.220
Um, whether it's war, um, you know, whether it's slaughtering of entire peoples,

02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:42.340
like it's, there's been a lot of pain and suffering that has come from religion.

02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:47.620
Um, so my little thing that has been hard for me is a faith crisis, right?

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:50.140
I had religion and then I lost it and then I had nothing.

02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:51.460
So that's for me.

02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:53.540
I was like, well, religion did that to me, right?

02:03:53.580 --> 02:03:59.100
Like, but then at one point it's kind of like, how much of my life am I just

02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:03.380
going to complain about like being raised Mormon or being depressed?

02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:07.300
Like, you know, as I get older, I'm like, okay, so what?

02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:11.860
Like, okay, it's really hurt me, but were there any good things that came out of

02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:12.700
Mormonism?

02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:15.380
Well, yeah, there's a lot of good things that have come to my family through

02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:17.340
Mormonism, closeness.

02:04:17.340 --> 02:04:18.500
We're really, really close.

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:21.540
Mormon culture is that you live together forever, right?

02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:24.260
The teaching is that you're in, your families are forever.

02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:26.700
We die and then we go to heaven together and we're together forever.

02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:29.900
My family really believes that principle, all of them do.

02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:36.300
And that instills a certain way of living that's kind of beautiful.

02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:41.620
Even if it's naivety, there's something kind of beautiful about believing

02:04:41.620 --> 02:04:44.540
that we're forming these bonds together as a family and that like, we're going

02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:45.740
to be together forever.

02:04:46.180 --> 02:04:48.100
It brings a lot of comfort to a kid too.

02:04:48.140 --> 02:04:52.220
When I was little, I was like, wow, it's going to be okay if I die because I get

02:04:52.220 --> 02:04:53.500
to see my mom again, you know what I mean?

02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:58.060
I like, I really believe that is the right answer that you tell that kid.

02:04:59.140 --> 02:05:01.260
Actually, when you die, you're not going to see your mom again.

02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:04.100
Maybe it might be, I don't know.

02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:07.980
And everybody's going to, anybody who has a kid is going to face that, that moment.

02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:11.460
I've already faced it where you sit down and my kid was like, Hey dad,

02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:13.700
when you die, am I going to see you again?

02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:18.260
That was actually a really hard moment for me because I was suddenly faced with,

02:05:18.940 --> 02:05:23.980
okay, do I give the answer that I thought was bullshit or do I give the answer of

02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:28.180
what I think it is, or do I give the real answer, which is I don't know?

02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:32.900
And that's what I chose, which as a father, that's not always the easiest

02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:36.220
answer because your kid, it's a wonderful thing that you feel like you can give

02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:39.660
your kid the comfort of like, Hey, your parents are going to take care of

02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:41.940
everything. We know everything we've been around.

02:05:41.940 --> 02:05:44.460
My kid's always like, are you the strongest? I'm like, yeah, I am the

02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:46.780
strongest. Stronger than everybody. Yeah. Yeah.

02:05:48.820 --> 02:05:52.860
So when you're faced with that moment, it's like, it's kind of sucks to tell

02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:56.740
your kid like, you know what, I don't know if you're going to see me after I

02:05:56.740 --> 02:06:01.340
die, but that, but I hope that's why I said, I was like, I don't know, but, but

02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:05.460
I hope I really hope cause that would be awesome if we can hang out forever.

02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:08.660
And if there's any way for it to happen, I'll make it happen.

02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:10.900
You know what I mean? That's kind of what my answer was.

02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:14.820
So long story short, sorry, I know that I'm being lengthy on this.

02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:19.620
Is there like, what is my thought on religion? It just is. It's going to,

02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:24.260
it's been here forever. It's coping. It maybe it's, I can't say whether it's

02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:29.140
true or false. How the hell am I supposed to know? I mean, like I've lived

02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:33.940
34 years on this planet. A lot of people have been around a lot longer than me

02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:37.580
and they really believe very deeply and a lot of them are smarter than me.

02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:40.460
You know what I mean? Like I look at my older brothers, for instance, who are

02:06:40.460 --> 02:06:46.620
very practicing Mormons. These guys are hyper intelligent. My, my younger sister,

02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:49.980
hyper intelligent. All of them start smarter than me. They all believe it

02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:54.300
still. So what am I supposed to say? Well, you're all stupid. You know what I mean?

02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:58.460
Like you're all wrong. I don't know. Like maybe it's the South park episode where

02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:02.220
everybody dies and then they're like, well, the right answer was Mormonism.

02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:08.780
Oh, like Mormon, Mormons love that moment in South park. They're like, Hey,

02:07:08.780 --> 02:07:11.940
that day may come. That day may come.

02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:17.700
Yes. So maybe, maybe I don't know is the honest answer for everybody around the

02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:23.580
table. But the biggest question for which I don't know is the right answer is,

02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:27.420
uh, what's the meaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life?

02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:34.140
No, you're not allowed to say, I don't know. Okay. Um, you can be just like

02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:39.180
your dad and say, let me just give my two cents, take it for whatever it's worth.

02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:42.940
Take it or leave it. It's probably worth nothing. It's pit, pit'll on the ground.

02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:52.620
I mean, what, why are we here? Is it, it's just busily creating all these kinds of

02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:57.580
things, worrying about things, having kids.

02:07:58.300 --> 02:08:13.500
I, my purpose, at least right now is to wake up and try to bring light love to

02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:21.740
the world, light love to myself and have integrity. That's my purpose. Um,

02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:28.060
the ultimate purpose of life that I guess that's my ultimate purpose of life.

02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:34.140
I, I, I don't know what happens when I die. I was, it gave me some sense that

02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:37.900
there's more to be known. I'm sure there are other things in life that would give

02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:42.780
me that. And I'm, I'm looking for it. I'm a seeker. Like I'm, I'm always looking

02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:48.300
for the next something to give me hope in something more, even if so, I could

02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:51.980
just not bullshit my kids when they asked me that question and be like, okay,

02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:59.340
you know what? I really don't know. I, I want to not know more. If that makes

02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:06.140
sense. I don't want to, like, I want to see things that make me confused, that

02:09:06.140 --> 02:09:12.780
make me question what I already knew. Like I am like, when I meet an atheist

02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:17.020
who comes up to me and they're like, atheism, atheism, atheism. It's just as

02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:20.540
laughable to me as when I meet the Mormon who comes up and they're like,

02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:25.980
Mormonism, Mormonism, Mormonism. I'm like, how do you, how do you, anyone,

02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:30.780
how do you guys know? Did like, like, you know.

02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:35.900
So you feel like you're doing some through all your travels, through all the

02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:39.260
people you meet, you feel like you're still keeping your eyes open and your

02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:45.580
heart open to sort of discover, discover something new, like the ayahuasca

02:09:45.580 --> 02:09:49.900
experience that there might be, there might be deeper truths out there.

02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:54.140
Yeah. And I want to find them and I want to surround myself with people who are

02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:57.580
just looking for it. I'm not, I'm not interested in people who are just

02:09:57.580 --> 02:10:02.220
looking to point fingers at each, like I, life is so short. I'm looking for, it's

02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:06.140
one of the reasons that I want to meet with you is I was like, wow, Lex really

02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:09.660
seems like he's on a journey to find truth. And that humility for me is same

02:10:09.660 --> 02:10:14.060
thing with Rick. It drew me to Rick. It was like, I really, I see that and I

02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:17.260
identify with it. And that's what I'm looking for. There's the final song on

02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:23.740
our record, our new record that's coming out. The chorus goes, and this is like,

02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:32.460
this is my best answer to what you're asking. The chorus goes, take it easy on

02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:39.420
me. I need some lullaby. They tell me heaven's just a lie. Well, I'm not

02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:45.740
surprised. Tell me that you know. No, you don't. Yeah. You're just like me. Can

02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:52.700
we just all hope for the best? Take it easy. That's it for me. It's like, I'm

02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:58.140
going to place my from like, I don't know. Tell me, you know, I don't, I'm

02:10:58.140 --> 02:11:00.940
not going to believe you. Maybe you do. I, I'm not going to believe it, but

02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:05.740
like, let's just be easier on each other and like, try to find truth

02:11:05.820 --> 02:11:10.380
wherever it may lie. But above all, know that we don't know jack shit.

02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:14.700
I think that's a mic drop moment. Dan, thank you so much. You're an incredible

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:19.900
human. I love that you share with the world, the darkness of your mind, of your

02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:22.940
life experience and the, and the beautiful light that you've shown to the

02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:27.100
world. So it's a huge honor and thank you for spending your valuable time. Good

02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:31.260
luck on the tour. Thanks man. Thanks for having me. Thanks for listening to this

02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:34.700
conversation with Dan Reynolds to support this podcast. Please check out

02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:39.100
our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from

02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:45.180
Aldous Huxley. After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the

02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:51.180
inexpressible is music. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
