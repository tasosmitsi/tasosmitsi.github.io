00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
How would you, as a higher intelligence, represent yourself to a lesser intelligence?

00:06.080 --> 00:09.680
Do you think they saw what they say they saw?

00:09.680 --> 00:12.000
It didn't just start showing up in 1947.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.960
How hard do you think it is for aliens to communicate with humans?

00:14.960 --> 00:16.640
What do we believe in? We believe in technology.

00:16.640 --> 00:20.080
So you show yourself as a form of technology, right?

00:20.080 --> 00:22.800
But the common thread is you're not alone.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.280
And there's something else here with you.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.400
And there's something that's, as you said, watching you.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.920
You are a professor at Stanford studying the biology of the human organism at the level of individual cells.

00:37.920 --> 00:43.680
So let me ask first the big ridiculous philosophical question.

00:43.680 --> 00:49.520
What is the most beautiful or fascinating aspect of human biology at the level of the cell to you?

00:49.520 --> 00:56.080
The micro machines and the nanomachines that proteins make and become, that to me is the most interesting.

00:56.640 --> 01:03.920
The fact that you have this basically dynamic computer within every cell that's constantly

01:03.920 --> 01:05.280
processing its environment.

01:05.840 --> 01:12.640
And at the heart of it is DNA, which is a dynamic machine, a dynamic computation process.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.840
People think of the DNA as a linear code.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.560
It's codes within codes within codes.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.760
And it is the actually the epigenetic state that's doing this amazing processing.

01:23.760 --> 01:27.360
I mean, if you ever wanted to believe in God, just look inside the cell.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.720
So DNA is both information and computer.

01:30.720 --> 01:31.220
Exactly.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
How did that computer come about?

01:34.880 --> 01:37.280
A big continuing on the philosophical question.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.280
Is this both scientific and philosophical?

01:39.280 --> 01:41.120
How did life originate on earth?

01:41.120 --> 01:44.240
Do you think how did this at every level?

01:44.240 --> 01:51.760
So the very first step and the fascinating complex computer that is DNA, that is multicellular

01:51.760 --> 01:57.600
organism, and then maybe the fascinating complex computer that is the human mind.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.640
Well, I think you have to take just one more step back to the complex computer that is

02:02.640 --> 02:04.320
the universe, right?

02:04.320 --> 02:10.080
All of the so-called particles or the waves that people think the universe is made of

02:10.080 --> 02:14.400
and appears to me at least to be a computational process.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.000
And embedded in that is biology, right?

02:18.000 --> 02:22.880
So all the atoms of a protein, et cetera, sit in that computational matrix.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.080
From my point of view, it's computing something.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.160
It's computing towards something.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.080
It was created in some ways.

02:30.080 --> 02:33.360
If you want to believe in God, and I don't know that I do, but if you want to believe

02:33.360 --> 02:40.000
in something, the universe was created or at least enabled to allow for life to form.

02:40.800 --> 02:46.000
And so the DNA, if you ask where does DNA come from, and you can go all the way back

02:46.000 --> 02:49.680
to Richard Dawkins and the selfish gene hypotheses.

02:50.640 --> 02:56.160
The way I look at DNA, though, is it is not a moment in time.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.560
It assumes the context of the body and the environment in which it's going to live.

03:00.560 --> 03:07.920
And so if you want to ask a question of where and how does information get stored, DNA,

03:07.920 --> 03:14.080
although it's only 3 billion base pairs long, contains more information than I think the

03:14.080 --> 03:20.080
entire computational memory resources of our current technology.

03:20.080 --> 03:25.920
Because who and what you are is both what you were as an egg all the way through to

03:25.920 --> 03:30.720
the day you die, and it embodies all the different cell types and organs in your body.

03:31.520 --> 03:40.560
And so it's a computational reservoir of information and expectation that you will become.

03:40.560 --> 03:45.520
So actually, I would sort of turn it around a different way and say, if you wanted to create

03:46.400 --> 03:53.360
the best memory storage system possible, you could reverse engineer what a human is

03:53.360 --> 04:00.720
and create a DNA memory system that is not just the linear version, but is also

04:01.600 --> 04:03.200
everything that it could become.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.880
When we're talking about DNA, we're talking about Earth and the environment creating DNA.

04:06.880 --> 04:12.080
So you're talking about trying to come up with an optimal computer for this particular

04:12.080 --> 04:20.960
environment. So if you reverse engineer that computer, what do you mean by considering

04:20.960 --> 04:22.800
all the possible things it could become?

04:22.800 --> 04:29.680
So who you are today. So 3 billion bits of information does not explain Lex Fridman,

04:29.680 --> 04:36.640
doesn't explain me. But the DNA embodies the expectation of the environment in which you

04:36.640 --> 04:45.760
will live and grow and become. So all the information that is you is actually

04:45.760 --> 04:51.200
not only embedded in the DNA, but it's embedded in the context of the world in which you

04:52.080 --> 04:59.520
grow into and develop. So all that information, though, is packed in the expectation of what

04:59.520 --> 05:00.720
the DNA expects to see.

05:01.520 --> 05:08.160
Interesting. So like some of the information, is that accurate to say is stored outside the body?

05:08.160 --> 05:13.520
Exactly. Yeah. The information is stored outside because there's a context of expectation.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.560
Isn't that interesting?

05:14.560 --> 05:22.560
Yes. Fascinating. I mean, to linger on this point, if we were to run Earth over again

05:22.560 --> 05:27.920
a million times, how many different versions of this type of computer would we get?

05:27.920 --> 05:32.080
I think it would be different each time. I mean, if you assume there's no such thing as fate,

05:32.880 --> 05:36.640
and it's not all pre-programmed, and that there is some sort of, let's say,

05:37.440 --> 05:43.840
variation or randomness at the beginning, you would get as many different versions of life

05:43.840 --> 05:48.560
as you could imagine. And I don't think it would all be unless there's something built into the

05:49.920 --> 05:54.240
substrate of the universe. It wouldn't always be left-handed proteins.

05:54.560 --> 06:03.440
But I wonder, with the flap of a butterfly wing, what effects it has, because it's possible that

06:04.000 --> 06:09.040
the system is really good at finding the efficient answer, and maybe the efficient answer

06:11.120 --> 06:14.720
is there's only a small, finite set of them for this particular environment.

06:14.720 --> 06:20.080
Exactly. That's kind of, in a way, the anthropomorphic universe of the multiverse

06:20.080 --> 06:25.120
expectations, right? That there's probably a zillion other kinds of universes out there,

06:25.120 --> 06:31.840
if you believe in multiverse theory. We only live in the ones where the rules are such

06:32.480 --> 06:39.120
that life like ours can exist. So using that logic, how many alien civilizations

06:39.120 --> 06:46.480
do you think are out there? There's trillions of environments, aka planets,

06:47.040 --> 06:54.080
or maybe you can think even bigger than planets. How many lifelike organisms do you think are

06:54.720 --> 07:00.080
out there thriving? And maybe how many do you think are long gone, but were once here?

07:00.800 --> 07:04.880
I think, well, innumerable, I think in terms of the positive.

07:04.880 --> 07:05.600
Greater than zero.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.280
Much greater than zero. I mean, I would just be surprised. What a waste,

07:09.280 --> 07:15.120
right, of all that space just for us, if we're never going to get there. That would be my

07:15.920 --> 07:21.520
that would be my first way to think about it. But second, I mean,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.320
I remember when I was about seven or eight years old, and I would love if any of your listeners

07:28.320 --> 07:35.200
could find this National Geographic. I remember opening the page of the National Geographic.

07:35.200 --> 07:41.200
I was about, again, seven to 10 years old. And it was sort of a current picture of the

07:41.280 --> 07:46.880
universe. It was around probably 1968, 1969. I just remember looking at it and thinking,

07:48.240 --> 07:54.080
what kinds of empires have risen and fallen across that space

07:56.000 --> 08:03.280
that we'll never know about? And isn't that sad that we know nothing about something so grand?

08:04.240 --> 08:12.320
And so I've always been a reader of science fiction, because I like the creative ideas

08:12.320 --> 08:18.640
of what people come up with. And I especially like science fiction writers that base it in

08:18.640 --> 08:25.680
good science, but base it also in evolution. That if you evolve a civilization from something

08:26.800 --> 08:32.480
lifelike, right, some sort of biology, its assumptions about the universe will come from

08:34.000 --> 08:39.840
the environment in which it grew up. So for instance, Larry Niven is a great writer,

08:40.560 --> 08:45.280
and he imagines different kinds of civilizations. In some cases, what happens if

08:48.080 --> 08:54.720
intelligence evolved from a herd animal, right? Would you lead from behind, right? Would you be,

08:56.560 --> 09:02.320
in his case, one of them were the so-called puppeteers. And to them, the moral imperative

09:02.320 --> 09:08.800
is cowardice. You put other people forward to run the risk for you, right? And so he writes

09:08.800 --> 09:15.680
entire books around that premise. There's another guy, Brin, David Brin is his name,

09:15.680 --> 09:22.160
and he writes the so-called Uplift Universe books. And in those, he takes different

09:23.840 --> 09:30.480
intelligences, each from a different evolutionary background. And then he posits

09:31.040 --> 09:34.640
a civilization based around where and what they came from.

09:35.840 --> 09:40.400
And so to me, I mean, that's just fun. But I mean, back to your original question,

09:41.120 --> 09:49.120
is how many are there? I think as many stars as we can see. Now, how many are currently there?

09:49.680 --> 09:56.160
I don't know. I mean, that's the whole question of how long can a civilization last before it

09:57.120 --> 10:03.440
runs out of steam? And you, for instance, does it just get bored? Or does it transcend to something

10:03.440 --> 10:08.080
else? Or does it say, I've seen enough and I'm done? What does running out of steam look like?

10:08.080 --> 10:13.360
It could be destroy itself or get bored. You know, or we've done everything we can, and

10:14.000 --> 10:19.680
they just decide to stop. I don't know. I just don't know. It's that you almost worry that we

10:19.680 --> 10:25.200
stop reproducing, or we slow down the reproduction rate to where the population can go to zero.

10:25.280 --> 10:30.720
Can go to zero and we can't, and we collapse. I mean, so the only way to get around that is

10:31.600 --> 10:36.080
perhaps create enough machines with AI to take care of us.

10:38.240 --> 10:45.920
What could possibly go wrong? You've talked to people that told stories of UFO encounters.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.520
What is the most fascinating to you about the stories of these UFO encounters that

10:52.480 --> 10:59.920
you've heard that people have told you? The similarity of them, the uniformity of the

10:59.920 --> 11:07.600
stories. Now, I just want to say upfront, a lot of people think that when I speculate,

11:08.400 --> 11:15.040
I believe something. That's not true. Speculation is just creativity. Speculation is the beginning

11:15.040 --> 11:23.360
of hypothesis. None of what I hear in terms of the anecdotes, do I necessarily believe are they

11:23.360 --> 11:27.440
true? But I still find them fascinating to listen to because at some level,

11:27.440 --> 11:34.880
there's still raw data and you have to listen. Once you start to hear the same story again and

11:34.880 --> 11:39.760
again, then you have to say, well, there might be something to it. I mean, maybe it's some kind of

11:39.760 --> 11:46.400
a Jungian background in the human mind and human consciousness that creates these stories

11:46.400 --> 11:51.520
again and again. It's coming out of the DNA. It's coming out of that pre-programmed something,

11:51.520 --> 11:55.280
and Jung talked quite a bit about this kind of thing, the collective unconscious.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.680
But actually, one of the most interesting ones I find is this constant

12:00.320 --> 12:11.600
message that you're not taking care of your world. This came long before climate change. It came long

12:11.600 --> 12:23.360
before many kinds of, let's say, current day memes around taking care of our planet, pollution,

12:23.360 --> 12:29.040
et cetera. For instance, perhaps the best example of this, the one that I find the most fascinating

12:29.040 --> 12:41.360
is a story out of Zimbabwe, 50 or 60 children one afternoon in Zimbabwe. It was a well-educated

12:41.360 --> 12:50.400
group of white and black children who at lunchtime in the playground saw a craft and they saw little

12:50.400 --> 12:56.160
men. They all ran into the teachers and they told the same story and they drew the same pictures.

12:56.480 --> 13:01.680
And the message several of them got was, you are not taking care of your planet.

13:03.680 --> 13:11.600
There's actually a movie coming out on this episode and 30 years later now, the people who

13:11.600 --> 13:18.560
were there, the children who've now grown up say, it happened to us. Now, did it happen? Was it some

13:18.560 --> 13:24.320
sort of hallucination or was it an imposed hallucination by something? Was it material?

13:24.320 --> 13:32.720
I don't know, but these kids were 7 to 10 years old. You see them on video. 7 to 10-year-olds

13:32.720 --> 13:39.920
can't lie like that. And so, whether it's real or not, I don't know, but I find that fascinating

13:39.920 --> 13:52.240
data. And again, it's these unconnected stories of individuals with the same story. That is worthy

13:52.720 --> 14:00.160
of further inquiry. Yeah. So here we are humans with limited cognitive capacities, trying to

14:00.160 --> 14:05.920
make sense of the world, trying to understand what is real and not. We have this DNA that somehow in

14:05.920 --> 14:16.080
complex ways is interacting with the environment. And then we get these novel ideas that come from

14:16.560 --> 14:27.440
the populace. And then they make us wonder about what it all means and so how to interpret it.

14:27.440 --> 14:33.440
If you think from an alien perspective, how would you communicate with other lifelike organisms?

14:34.400 --> 14:43.360
You perhaps have to find in points on this interaction between the DNA and its manifestations

14:43.360 --> 14:52.720
in terms of the human mind and how it interacts with the environment. What is this DNA? What is

14:52.720 --> 14:59.120
this environment? I have to get in somehow to interact with it, to perturb the system

14:59.120 --> 15:08.480
to where these little human-like ants get excited and figure stuff out. And then somehow steer them,

15:09.440 --> 15:14.480
first of all, for investigative purposes, understand. Oftentimes to understand a system,

15:14.480 --> 15:21.360
you have to perturb it. Exactly. It's like poke at it to get excited or not. And then the other

15:21.360 --> 15:28.560
ways you want to, if you worry about them, you can steer in one direction or another. And this kind

15:28.560 --> 15:35.760
of idea that we're not taking care of our world. That's interesting. I mean, that's comforting.

15:35.760 --> 15:40.880
That's hopeful because that means the greater intelligence, which is what I would hope,

15:40.880 --> 15:47.040
we want to take care of us. We want to take care of the gorillas in the national parks in Africa.

15:47.040 --> 15:51.360
Yeah. But we don't want to take care of cockroaches. So there's a line we draw.

15:51.360 --> 15:57.600
So you have to hope that- Right now we're a bunch of angry monkeys and maybe whatever these

15:57.600 --> 16:05.120
intelligences are, are also keeping an eye on us. That you don't want the angry monkey troop

16:05.920 --> 16:11.520
stomping around the local galactic arm. Do you think these folks are telling the truth?

16:11.520 --> 16:18.960
Do you think they saw what they say they saw? I think they saw what they said they saw,

16:18.960 --> 16:25.040
but I also think they saw what they were shown. I mean, if you go back to the whole notion of,

16:25.680 --> 16:30.400
okay, how long has this been around? It didn't just start showing up in 1947,

16:31.120 --> 16:38.880
there are stories going back into the 1800s of people who saw things in their farming,

16:38.880 --> 16:45.520
in their farm fields in the US. It's in local newspapers from the 1800s. It's fascinating.

16:46.160 --> 16:54.080
But if you can go even further back, so to your point of how would you as a higher intelligence

16:54.080 --> 17:01.840
represent yourself to a lesser intelligence? Well, let's go back to pre-civilization.

17:01.840 --> 17:07.680
Maybe you show yourself as the spirits in the forest and you give messages through that.

17:08.480 --> 17:13.600
Once you get a little bit more civilized, then you show yourself as the gods and then you're

17:13.600 --> 17:17.760
God. Well, we don't believe in God anymore necessarily. Not everybody does. So what do

17:17.760 --> 17:21.280
we believe in? We believe in technology. So you show yourself as a form of technology,

17:22.160 --> 17:27.840
right? But the common thread is you're not alone and there's something else here with you.

17:28.640 --> 17:34.400
And there's something that's, as you said, watching you and at least watching over your shoulder.

17:35.680 --> 17:43.520
But I think that like any good parent, you don't tell your student everything. You make them learn

17:44.240 --> 17:49.840
and learning requires mistakes because if you tell them everything, then they get lazy.

17:50.080 --> 17:56.960
You've looked at the brains or information coming from the brain of some of the people

17:56.960 --> 18:01.440
that have had UFO encounters. What's common about the brain of people who encounter UFOs?

18:02.960 --> 18:09.840
So the study started with a group of, let's say a cohort of individuals that were brought to me

18:10.320 --> 18:18.640
and their MRIs to ask about the damage that had been seen in these individuals. It turns out that

18:19.040 --> 18:22.720
it turns out that the majority of those patients ended up being as far as we can tell,

18:22.720 --> 18:30.080
Havana syndrome. And so for me at least, that part of the story ends in terms of the injury.

18:30.080 --> 18:36.320
It's likely almost all Havana syndrome. That's somebody else's problem now. That's not my problem.

18:38.640 --> 18:43.280
But when we were looking at the brains of these individuals, we noticed something right in the

18:43.280 --> 18:49.200
center of the basal ganglia in many of these individuals that at first we thought was damage.

18:49.200 --> 18:57.840
It was basically an enriched patch of MRI dense neurons that we thought was damage. But then it

18:57.840 --> 19:02.240
was showing up in everybody and then we looked and they said, oh, it's actually not. The other

19:02.240 --> 19:08.160
readings on these MRI showed that actually that's living tissue. That's actually the head of the

19:08.160 --> 19:12.960
caudate and the pitamen. And at the time, and I remember even asking a good friend of mine

19:13.600 --> 19:19.280
at Stanford who was a psychiatrist, what does the basal ganglia do? He said, oh, the basal ganglia

19:19.280 --> 19:25.520
is just about movement and nerve and motor control. I said, well, that's odd because

19:27.040 --> 19:30.960
these other papers that we were reading at the time started to suggest that it was involved

19:31.520 --> 19:37.120
with higher intelligence and is actually downstream of the executive function

19:38.240 --> 19:45.360
and involved with intuition and planning. And then if you think about it, if you're

19:45.360 --> 19:50.640
going to have motor control, which is centralized in one place, motor control requires knowledge

19:50.640 --> 19:56.080
of the environment. You don't want to move something and hit the table. Or if you're

19:56.080 --> 20:03.040
walking across a room, you want to be aware and cognizant of what you might bump into.

20:03.600 --> 20:13.600
So obviously, all of that planning requires access to all the senses. It requires access

20:13.600 --> 20:19.840
to your desires, memory, knowledge of where and what you want and desire to walk nearby. Like

20:19.840 --> 20:23.760
I use the example of if you're at a party, you want to avoid that person. You like that person.

20:23.760 --> 20:30.720
The waiter is about to drop something. All without thinking, you maneuver. So that actually,

20:30.720 --> 20:36.160
all that planning is done in the basal ganglia. And it's actually now called the brain within the

20:36.160 --> 20:47.040
brain. It's a goal processing system subservient to executive function. So what we think we found

20:47.040 --> 20:52.800
there was not something which allows people to talk to UFOs. I think the UFO community

20:54.320 --> 21:02.080
took it a step too far. What I think we found was a form of higher functioning and processing.

21:02.720 --> 21:08.960
So what we then looked at, and this was the most fascinating part of it, we looked then at

21:08.960 --> 21:15.440
individuals in the families of those, let's say the index case individuals. And we found that it

21:15.440 --> 21:21.680
was actually in families. And more so, this is the most fascinating part. We've probably looked now

21:21.680 --> 21:28.800
at about 200 just random cases that you can download off of databases online. You don't see

21:28.800 --> 21:36.320
this higher connectivity. You only find it in what Kit Green would have called or has called

21:36.320 --> 21:44.640
higher functioning individuals, people who are, I mean, he called them savants. I don't have the

21:44.640 --> 21:53.040
means to, we haven't done the testing, but it turns out my family has it. We found it in me,

21:53.040 --> 21:59.760
my brother, my sister, my mother. We found it as well in other individuals, husband and wife pairs.

22:00.480 --> 22:05.760
So statistically, if you had a group of 20 individuals and you found two husband wife pairs,

22:05.760 --> 22:11.520
both of whom had it, and yet it's only found at about we think one in 200, one in 300 individuals,

22:11.520 --> 22:16.800
the fact that two individuals came together, two sets of individuals came together, both of whom

22:16.800 --> 22:28.560
had it, implied either a restricted breeding group or attraction. The reason why it seems to be

22:29.440 --> 22:37.040
in, let's say so-called experiencers or people who claim, if intuition is the ability to see

22:37.040 --> 22:43.040
something that other people don't, I don't mean that in a paranormal sense, but being able to see

22:43.040 --> 22:48.720
something just in front of you that other people might just dismiss. Well, maybe that's a function

22:48.720 --> 22:57.680
of a higher kind of intelligence to say, well, I'm not looking at an artifact. I'm not looking at

22:57.680 --> 23:02.720
something that I should just ignore. I'm seeing something and I recognize it for not what it is,

23:02.720 --> 23:06.640
but that it is something different than what is normally found in my environment.

23:07.760 --> 23:14.720
Yeah. You know, I have a little bit of that. I seem to see the magic in a lot of moments.

23:14.720 --> 23:22.480
Like I have a deep, it's obviously not obviously, but it seems to be chemical in nature that I just

23:23.120 --> 23:29.040
am excited about life. I love life. I love like stupid things. It feels like I'm high a lot

23:29.760 --> 23:34.320
on like mushrooms or something like that, where you'd really appreciate that. So you're able,

23:34.320 --> 23:41.760
I'm able to detect something about the environment that maybe others don't, I don't know, but like,

23:41.760 --> 23:48.720
I seem to be over the top, grateful to be alive on a lot of first, a lot of stupid reasons.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.160
And that's in there somewhere. I mean, it's kind of interesting because

23:52.160 --> 23:59.920
it really is true that our brains, the way we're brought up, but also the genetics

24:00.720 --> 24:09.040
enables us to see certain slices of the world. And some people are probably more receptive to

24:10.400 --> 24:17.360
anomalous information. They see the magic, the possibility in the novel thing,

24:18.320 --> 24:24.240
right? As opposed to kind of finding the pattern of the common, of the regular.

24:24.240 --> 24:28.240
Some people are more, wait a minute, this is kind of weird. I mean, a lot of those people

24:28.240 --> 24:34.720
probably become scientists too, like, huh, like there's this pattern happening over and over and

24:34.720 --> 24:40.880
over and then something weird just happened. And then you get excited by that weirdness

24:40.880 --> 24:46.480
and start to pull the string and discover what is at the core of that weirdness. And perhaps

24:47.440 --> 24:51.120
is that, you know, maybe by way of question,

24:53.040 --> 24:57.600
how does the human perception system deal with anomalous information? Do you think?

24:57.600 --> 25:02.960
Well, it first tries to classify it and get it out of the way. If it's not food, if it's not sex,

25:03.760 --> 25:11.040
right? If it's not in the way of my desires, or if it is in the way of my desires, then

25:11.680 --> 25:19.120
you focus on it. And so the, I think the question is how much spare processing power,

25:19.120 --> 25:27.120
how much CPU cycles do we spend on things that are not those core desires?

25:28.240 --> 25:38.720
What is the most kind of memorable, powerful UFO encounter report you've ever heard? Just

25:39.360 --> 25:42.720
on a personal level, like something that was really powerful.

25:42.720 --> 25:48.320
Well, I mentioned the Zimbabwe one that's particularly interesting and one that actually

25:48.320 --> 25:56.000
most people don't know about, but family driving down the highway, two little girls in the back,

25:56.960 --> 26:06.800
open glass topped car, and the little girls see a craft right over their car. This is in the middle

26:06.800 --> 26:15.440
of the day on a busy highway. The mother sees it. Nobody can, they look around, nobody else seems

26:15.440 --> 26:20.560
to see it. So the girls take out their camera, take a picture of it, and then they get home.

26:21.920 --> 26:29.760
They look at the picture. There's no craft, but there's a little object about 30 feet above their

26:30.400 --> 26:36.960
car or so, probably about three feet across, kind of star shaped. It's not the craft,

26:38.000 --> 26:42.720
but it's something else. There's obviously, there was something there. And so what were they seeing?

26:42.720 --> 26:46.720
Were they seeing a projection? Were they seeing, and why were only they seeing it?

26:47.920 --> 26:53.440
And the photograph was capturing something very different than they were seeing,

26:53.520 --> 26:59.520
but they're still an object. Can you give a little bit of context? Is this from modern day?

26:59.520 --> 27:02.400
It's modern day. Oh yeah, they had a camera. I mean, they had a cell phone camera.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.480
And this was like a- Four or five years ago.

27:04.480 --> 27:08.960
Report provided. By the way, where's like a central place to provide a report? Is this-

27:08.960 --> 27:12.480
Oh, there's a move on, but this isn't public. I've seen the picture.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.480
Oh, this is something you've directly interacted with.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.640
Yeah. Yeah. I've seen the picture.

27:16.640 --> 27:23.120
So those moments like that, they captivate your mind.

27:23.120 --> 27:28.000
It's so different. It doesn't fall into the standard story at all, but it also,

27:28.000 --> 27:34.640
but in another way, it's kind of a, it's a clear enunciation of this notion that when

27:34.640 --> 27:39.440
people see events, they don't all see the same thing. Now we've heard this about like traffic

27:39.440 --> 27:43.920
accidents. Different people will see the color of the car differently or the chain of events

27:43.920 --> 27:48.640
differently. And this tells you that memory isn't anywhere near what we think it is.

27:48.720 --> 27:56.080
But the issue around these so-called UFO reports is that the same people will see a very different

27:56.080 --> 28:03.600
thing, almost as if whatever it is, is projecting a, is projecting something into the mind

28:04.320 --> 28:08.640
rather than it being real, right? Rather than it being a real manifestation,

28:09.760 --> 28:13.440
material in front of you, it's actually almost some sort of an altered

28:13.920 --> 28:20.800
virtual reality that is imposed on you. I mean, you know, I think the company Metta

28:21.360 --> 28:25.920
and all the virtual reality companies would love to have something like that, right? Well,

28:25.920 --> 28:30.800
you don't have to actually wear something on your face to experience a virtual reality.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.720
What happens if you could just project it? Well, that's the fundamental question from

28:34.720 --> 28:40.160
an alien perspective. When you look at it, or as we humans look at ants, how does this

28:40.880 --> 28:46.240
perception system operate? So not only how does this thing's mind operate, how does the human

28:46.240 --> 28:52.720
mind operate, but how does it, their perception system operate so that we can like stimulate the

28:52.720 --> 28:59.120
perception system properly to get them to think certain things. And so, you know,

29:00.560 --> 29:07.200
that's a really important question. Humans think that, you know, the only way to communicate is in

29:07.200 --> 29:14.000
like 3D or 4D space time. There's physical objects, or maybe you write things in some

29:14.000 --> 29:24.080
kind of language, but there could be just so much more richness in how you can communicate. And so

29:24.080 --> 29:28.240
from an alien perspective, or somebody has much greater technological capabilities, you have to

29:28.240 --> 29:35.440
figure out how do I use the skills I have to stimulate the human, the limited humans.

29:35.440 --> 29:40.320
Right. Well, I mean, let's take the ants exam, again, as an example, let's say that you wanted

29:40.320 --> 29:46.000
to make ants practical, you wanted to use them for something, right, you wanted to use them as

29:46.000 --> 29:52.800
a form of biological robot. Now, DARPA and other people have been trying to use insects for,

29:53.440 --> 29:58.640
you know, into turn them into biological robots. But if you wanted to, you would have to interact

29:58.640 --> 30:06.560
with their sense of smell, right, their pheromone system that they use to interact with each other.

30:06.560 --> 30:12.880
So you would either create those molecules to talk to them to make them do not say talk to them as

30:12.880 --> 30:16.000
if they're intelligent, but talk to them to manipulate them in ways that you want.

30:16.800 --> 30:22.960
Or if you were advanced enough, you would use some sort of electromagnetic or other

30:23.680 --> 30:30.240
means to stimulate their neurons in ways that would accomplish the same goal as the pheromones,

30:30.240 --> 30:37.120
but by doing it in a sort of a telefactoring way. So let's say you wanted to telefactor with humans,

30:37.920 --> 30:43.680
you would interact with them. And this is again, this is a technology which you could imagine

30:43.680 --> 30:50.880
possible. You could telefactor information into the sensory system of a human, right, but then

30:51.760 --> 30:56.240
each human is a little bit different. So either you know enough about them to tailor it to that

30:56.240 --> 31:01.440
individual, or you just basically take advantage of whatever the sensory net is that that individual

31:01.440 --> 31:07.680
has. So if you happen to be good at sound, or you happen to be a very visually inclined individual,

31:08.240 --> 31:14.640
then maybe the sensory information that you get that's most effective in terms of transmitting

31:14.640 --> 31:19.760
information would come through that portal. I think the aliens would need to figure out

31:19.760 --> 31:25.840
that humans value physical consistency. So we've discovered physics. So we want

31:26.400 --> 31:31.440
our perception to make sense. Maybe they don't, they haven't, you know, that's not an obvious

31:31.440 --> 31:39.120
fact of perception that you have to figure out what kind of things are humans used to observing

31:39.120 --> 31:45.360
in this particular environment of earth. And how do we stimulate the perception system in a way

31:45.360 --> 31:52.720
that's not anomalous or not too, doesn't cross the threshold of just like, well, that's way too

31:52.720 --> 31:58.880
weird. So they have to, I mean, that's not obvious that that should be important. You know, maybe you

31:58.880 --> 32:06.240
want to err on the side of anomaly, like lean into the weirdness. So communication is complicated.

32:06.240 --> 32:11.600
Yeah. Well, that's why I always, I always find this issue of people talking about the so-called

32:11.600 --> 32:18.320
greys as interesting because it is related to what you're saying. They're different enough,

32:19.280 --> 32:25.440
but they're not so different as to be scary, right? They're not venom dripping fangs, right?

32:25.440 --> 32:32.800
They're different enough, but they all, it's also like they're what you could imagine us becoming

32:32.800 --> 32:39.200
in some distant future. So is that a purposeful representation? I don't know. I mean, I don't

32:39.200 --> 32:45.200
believe in the greys for instance, but I believe that people think that they see it. So if we're

32:45.200 --> 32:50.640
talking about a communication strategy that says, you know, we're, we're like you, but not

32:51.360 --> 32:58.240
the same as you, this might be a manifestation that you, that you represent in terms of a

32:58.240 --> 33:06.880
communication strategy. What do you make of David's favorite sighting of the Tic Tac UFO and other

33:06.880 --> 33:12.960
pilots who have seen these objects that seem to defy the laws of physics? Well, I think

33:13.920 --> 33:19.360
you have to take them at their word. Are they fascinating to you? Oh, absolutely. No, I know,

33:19.360 --> 33:25.840
I know a lot of these people, right? So I, I know Lou Elizondo, Chris Mellon, the whole crowd I've

33:25.840 --> 33:35.360
been, I saw the videos about three weeks or so before they went public. I was at a bar with Lou

33:36.000 --> 33:41.280
overlooking the Pentagon in Crystal City and they showed them to me and my hair stood on end.

33:41.920 --> 33:48.320
And he said, he said, this is, he said, this is coming out soon. And I, I know one of the guys on

33:48.320 --> 33:54.400
the inside who was the Naval Intelligence who had interviewed all of these pilots again, before this

33:54.400 --> 34:03.200
came out and it was hair raising to hear this. But also exciting that, you know, here's not just

34:03.200 --> 34:07.520
people's testimony. These are credible individuals. And if you've seen the 60-minute

34:07.520 --> 34:14.320
episode with some of the pilots, you know, they have no monetary gain. If anything, they've got

34:14.320 --> 34:21.680
negative gain from coming out. But then you also have all of those simultaneous ship

34:21.680 --> 34:28.720
analysis from the USS Princeton and the radar analysis, et cetera. So, you know, at the end of

34:28.720 --> 34:38.160
the day, it's just data. It's not a conclusion. I'm, I'd be perfectly happy, honestly, perfectly

34:38.160 --> 34:44.000
happy if somebody showed that it was all a hoax. I can go back to my day job, right?

34:44.000 --> 34:49.520
That could be a hoax, but other things might not be. I mean, this is the point. I mean,

34:49.520 --> 34:55.600
this is why it's nice to remove some of the stigma about this topic because it's all just data and,

34:56.560 --> 35:03.760
uh, and anomalous events are such that there's going to be, they're going to be rare in terms

35:03.760 --> 35:09.520
of how much data they represent, but we have to consider the full range of data to discover the

35:09.520 --> 35:14.560
things that actually represent something that's, um, if we pull at it, we'll discover something

35:14.560 --> 35:21.840
that's extraterrestrial or something deep about the phenomena on earth that we don't yet understand.

35:22.560 --> 35:28.800
Well, if it only stimulates people, for instance, to think, okay, well, what happens if we could

35:28.800 --> 35:37.280
move like that with momentumless movement? And, and it stimulates young individuals to go into the

35:37.280 --> 35:43.520
sciences to ask those questions. That to me is fascinating. I mean, after I've been openly

35:43.520 --> 35:50.880
talking about this in the last year, especially I've had a number of, uh, students from top schools

35:50.880 --> 35:58.560
who aren't my students come to me and say, if I can help, let me, how can I help? I never had

35:58.560 --> 36:03.280
thought about this before, but you opened you and others, not just you and others have opened my

36:03.280 --> 36:09.760
mind to thinking about this matter. Yeah, that's why it's actually funny that, uh, Elon Musk doesn't

36:09.760 --> 36:15.840
think too much about this, uh, these kinds of proportional systems that could defy the laws

36:15.840 --> 36:22.320
of physics as we currently understand them. To me, it's a powerful way to think what is possible.

36:23.520 --> 36:28.720
It's, uh, it's inspiring. Even if some of the data doesn't represent, uh, uh,

36:28.720 --> 36:33.840
extraterrestrial vehicles, I think the, the observation itself, it's like, uh, something

36:33.840 --> 36:41.040
you mentioned, which is, uh, you know, hypothesizing, imagining these things, considering

36:41.120 --> 36:48.480
the possibility of these things, I think opens up your mind in a way that, uh, ultimately can create

36:48.480 --> 36:53.040
the technology. First, you have to believe the technology is possible before you can create it.

36:53.920 --> 37:01.520
In my own lab, you know, we always look for, as I've said before, what is inevitable and,

37:01.520 --> 37:06.400
you know, saying inevitably, this is the kind of data we need, but if we need that kind of data,

37:06.400 --> 37:13.360
the instrument we want isn't, doesn't exist. Okay. So I imagine the perfect instrument,

37:13.360 --> 37:20.160
I can't make it. And you back into something which is practical. And then you, in a sense,

37:20.160 --> 37:26.880
reverse engineer the future of what it is that you want to make. And I've started and sold like

37:27.520 --> 37:34.560
at least half a dozen or more companies using that basic premise. And so it was always something

37:34.560 --> 37:40.720
that didn't exist today, but we imagined what we wanted. And at the time, many people said it

37:40.720 --> 37:45.280
couldn't be done. I mean, for instance, all the gene therapy that's done today with retroviruses

37:46.080 --> 37:53.040
came from a group meeting in David Baltimore's lab. I was a postdoc with him and one of the

37:53.040 --> 38:00.000
other postdocs wasn't able to make retroviruses in a way that he wanted to. And I realized I had a

38:00.000 --> 38:06.720
cell line that would allow us to make retroviruses in two days rather than two months. And so he and

38:06.720 --> 38:11.760
I then worked together to make that system. And now all gene therapy with retroviruses is done

38:11.760 --> 38:17.760
using this basic approach around the whole world because something couldn't be done and we wanted

38:17.760 --> 38:27.040
to do it better. And we imagined the future. And so that's, I think what the whole UFO phenomenon

38:27.040 --> 38:32.880
is doing for people is like, well, let's imagine a future where these kinds of technologies are,

38:32.880 --> 38:36.880
but also let's imagine a future where we don't blow ourselves up, right? So if these things

38:36.880 --> 38:44.720
are there, they managed to not blow themselves up. So it means that at least one other civilization

38:44.720 --> 38:50.480
got past the inflection point. So if some of the encounters are actually representing alien

38:50.480 --> 38:58.800
civilizations visiting us, why do you think they're doing so? You suggested that perhaps

38:58.800 --> 39:05.280
it's this study understand their own past, right? What are some of the motivations do you think?

39:05.280 --> 39:11.760
And again, from our perspective, us as humans, what motivations would we have when we approach

39:11.760 --> 39:19.440
other civilizations we may discover in the future? Well, I think one motivation might be to steer us

39:19.440 --> 39:27.440
away from the precipice, right? Or on the assumption that even if we make it past the precipice,

39:27.440 --> 39:34.880
at least we're not a bunch of psychopaths running around. So maybe there's a little bit of motivation

39:34.880 --> 39:43.760
there to make sure that the neighbor that's growing up next to you is not unruly. But I mean,

39:43.840 --> 39:49.520
maybe it's sort of a moral imperative like what we have with creating

39:51.760 --> 39:57.520
national parks where animals can continue to live out their lives in a natural way.

39:58.880 --> 40:08.480
I don't know. I mean, the problem is we're imagining from an anthropomorphic viewpoint

40:08.480 --> 40:15.280
what an alien might think. And as I've said before, alien means alien, right? I mean,

40:15.280 --> 40:23.600
not Hollywood aliens, but a whole different way of thinking and a whole different level of experience

40:23.600 --> 40:31.760
and let's say wisdom, hopefully, that we could only hope to understand. Now, but if we ever get

40:31.760 --> 40:38.400
out there, if we ever make it past our current problems and even if we don't have faster than

40:38.400 --> 40:45.920
light travel and even if we're only using ram scoops or light sails to get where we want to go

40:46.960 --> 40:53.920
and it takes us 10,000 years to get somewhere or to spread out, we might encounter such things and

40:53.920 --> 41:00.800
are we just going to stomp all over it like we did in colonial South America or Africa or all the

41:00.800 --> 41:07.680
rest on our current path likely? And so what are we going to learn? Well, we're getting better and

41:07.680 --> 41:14.880
better at understanding what is life. And I think we're getting better and better being careful,

41:14.880 --> 41:20.960
not to step on it when we see it. And this is one of the nice things about talking about UFOs

41:21.520 --> 41:27.600
is it expands the Overton window. It expands our understanding of what possibly could be life.

41:28.320 --> 41:33.360
It gets us to think. It gets the scientific community to think. When we go to Mars or

41:33.360 --> 41:38.400
when we go to these different moons that possibly have life, we're not looking at

41:38.400 --> 41:49.840
legged organisms. We're looking at some kind of complexity that arises in resistance to the

41:49.840 --> 41:56.640
natural world. And there's a lot of interesting- I like that, resistance to the natural world, yeah.

41:57.600 --> 42:05.040
Somehow there's a rebellious process, complex system going on here. And I don't know the many

42:05.040 --> 42:12.640
ways it could take form. And there's a sense for aliens that as the technology develops,

42:12.640 --> 42:19.200
they take form more and more as information, as something that can influence the space of

42:19.920 --> 42:28.960
of ideas, of the processing of data itself. So this idea of embodiment that we humans so admire,

42:30.240 --> 42:38.240
physically visible, perceivable embodiment, may be a very inefficient thing.

42:39.600 --> 42:47.680
If you think just about your area, AI, we're trying to make smaller and smaller and smaller

42:47.920 --> 42:58.640
circuitry that is basically closer and closer to the physics of how the universe operates,

42:59.440 --> 43:02.800
right? Right down at the level of- I mean, quantum computers are basically right down

43:02.800 --> 43:10.480
about quantum information storage. So fast forward 10,000, 100,000 years, maybe somebody

43:10.480 --> 43:16.480
found a way to embody AI directly into the physics of the universe, right? And it doesn't

43:17.200 --> 43:25.120
require a physical manifestation. It just sits in space-time. It's just a locally ordered space-time.

43:25.120 --> 43:32.800
We're just locally ordered space-time, right? But maybe they just found a way to embody it there.

43:33.680 --> 43:37.600
They probably have to get really good at not, you know, trampling on the ants.

43:38.960 --> 43:42.400
The better your technology gets, the easier it is to accidentally like, oops,

43:42.960 --> 43:47.360
right? Just destroy these simpleton biological systems.

43:47.920 --> 43:52.880
We constantly think about whatever these things might be. We think that they are some sort of a

43:52.880 --> 44:02.000
unified force. Well, maybe they're not unified. Maybe they are as disparate as you and I are.

44:02.880 --> 44:07.120
And maybe what keeps them from stomping all over the ants is each other,

44:07.520 --> 44:15.120
right? That they are in a self-tension to prevent one or more of them from running amok.

44:16.480 --> 44:22.000
Oh, yeah. I mean, that's kind of the anarchy of nations that we have on Earth. So there's always

44:23.440 --> 44:26.560
going to be this- There's a hierarchy.

44:26.560 --> 44:31.200
This hierarchy that's formed of greater and greater intelligences. And they're all probably

44:31.200 --> 44:36.160
also wondering, wait, what's bigger than me? Exactly. That's what I always say.

44:36.160 --> 44:40.480
Exactly. That's what I always wonder is that maybe that what keeps them in line

44:41.120 --> 44:45.440
is something that is beyond them. Like what created the universe? I mean,

44:46.320 --> 44:52.320
that's probably a question that bothers them too. What about the communication task itself?

44:53.040 --> 44:57.600
How hard do you think it is for aliens to communicate with humans? So is this something

44:57.600 --> 45:03.360
you think about, about this barrier of communication between biological systems

45:03.360 --> 45:07.200
and something else? How difficult is it to find a common language?

45:08.480 --> 45:13.920
Well, I think if you're smart enough or technologically enabled enough, it's

45:14.640 --> 45:21.360
relatively straightforward. Now, whether your concepts

45:23.520 --> 45:28.560
can ever be dumbed down to us, that might be hard.

45:29.920 --> 45:32.160
I mean- Again, talking to the ants.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.440
Talking to the ants. I mean-

45:33.440 --> 45:34.160
On Instagram.

45:38.160 --> 45:40.320
You want to look good in this picture. Let me explain-

45:40.320 --> 45:50.400
Let me explain to you why. Yeah. So that's the essential problem of perhaps they realize

45:51.600 --> 45:57.760
who it is that they're talking to. And they say, rather than muddy the picture,

45:57.760 --> 46:03.680
we're only going to give them limited information. And yeah, maybe we could sit down

46:04.240 --> 46:08.000
like you and I and have a conversation, but then they would make assumptions.

46:08.880 --> 46:12.800
The humans would then make assumptions about us that aren't true because we're not humans.

46:13.840 --> 46:22.320
So let's stay at arm's length. Let's just let them know that we're here. And here's the limited

46:22.320 --> 46:29.040
amount of communication. Again, this notion that if you give somebody everything, they'll get lazy.

46:30.400 --> 46:36.080
And if they've been around as long as they have, they've seen every kind of thing that can go

46:36.080 --> 46:44.160
wrong. And so they know as much as they might want to step in, that would be a wrong thing.

46:45.520 --> 46:49.360
Yeah. You have to also understand that the amount of wisdom they carry.

46:50.160 --> 46:58.160
Yeah. And so it's very easy as well for religions to- I don't want to get into a whole religious

46:58.160 --> 47:05.040
conversation, but it's very easy for you to see how religions could call them angels or devils or

47:05.840 --> 47:11.120
what have you. Because again, if you're trying to fit it into a framework of cultural understanding,

47:12.080 --> 47:21.120
the first thing you reach for is God. And so when you look at what these things are,

47:21.120 --> 47:25.520
and again, with the angels and the devils, in a similar sort of way,

47:26.800 --> 47:33.120
their communication is limited. They just kind of give little- what's the oracle of Delphi?

47:33.120 --> 47:38.080
They kind of give these Delphic pronouncements, and then it's up to you to figure out what it is

47:38.080 --> 47:47.600
that they really mean. Steven Greer claimed that a skeleton discovered in Atacama region of Chile

47:48.240 --> 47:55.600
might be an alien. You reached out to him and took on the task of proving or disproving that

47:55.600 --> 48:02.000
with the rigor of science. The result is a paper titled, Whole Genome Sequencing of Atacama Skeleton

48:02.000 --> 48:07.520
Shows Novel Mutations Linked with Displasia. Can you tell this full story?

48:08.640 --> 48:17.760
The story was, as you put it right there, correct. Reached out, got a sample of the body,

48:18.320 --> 48:27.040
did the DNA sequencing, then worked with a team of two other Stanford scientists and Roche

48:27.040 --> 48:33.040
Sequencing Group, Roche Diagnostics, and probably a total team of about 11 or so people.

48:34.480 --> 48:39.760
And as is standard in these kinds of things, the professors actually don't do the work.

48:40.320 --> 48:46.240
The students do the work and figured out the answer, and then we helped them put together the

48:46.240 --> 48:55.760
story. And the story was simply that it was human, 100%. I went into it thinking it was originally

48:55.760 --> 49:02.880
a monkey of some sort. I got kind of excited a few months into the process thinking, well,

49:02.880 --> 49:08.000
what happens if it is an alien, right? Can you describe some of the characteristics

49:08.000 --> 49:12.160
of the skeleton that makes it unique and interesting? Primarily, it had dysmorphias

49:12.160 --> 49:17.440
of the brain. And so the first thing I did, actually, when I got pictures of it, I took it

49:17.440 --> 49:27.920
to a local expert at Stanford, and he was on the paper. And he was the world expert in pediatric

49:28.560 --> 49:35.840
bone dysmorphias. He literally wrote the book on this, because that's what you do. You go to

49:35.840 --> 49:40.720
an expert when it's outside of your field of interest. And he said, well, I haven't seen this

49:40.720 --> 49:48.800
particular collection of mutations before or this physiology before, but here's what I think it

49:48.800 --> 49:59.280
might be. And he said, but based on the size of the thing and the bone density, it would appear

49:59.280 --> 50:07.360
to be like six or seven years old. Now, again, that's the thing where I think the lay public

50:07.600 --> 50:15.120
doesn't understand or takes a speculation like that and turns it into a fact. No one ever said

50:15.120 --> 50:20.800
that it was that age. We only said that the bones made it look like it was that age. But then we

50:20.800 --> 50:29.280
went back and looked for genetic explanations of why things might look the way they did. And if you,

50:29.280 --> 50:34.640
again, read the paper, it's very carefully caveated to say that these mutations might

50:34.640 --> 50:42.320
result in this. But what we did find was an unexpectedly large number of mutations associated

50:42.320 --> 50:49.520
with bone growth in this individual. And it was just a bad roll of the dice. You roll the dice

50:49.520 --> 50:59.440
enough times with enough people born every year, and someone will roll the wrong dice all at once.

50:59.680 --> 51:05.600
So the sad part about it was individuals in the UFO community who wanted to think

51:06.160 --> 51:13.440
that there was some sort of conspiracy around it, right? That somebody had somehow convinced

51:13.440 --> 51:24.400
all of my students to lie. I mean, come on. I would lose my job, first of all, and they would all be

51:25.360 --> 51:30.800
in trouble forever. Yeah. But also, it's just projecting malevolence onto people that

51:31.760 --> 51:37.200
doesn't, I don't think exist in normal populace, and especially doesn't exist in the scientific

51:37.200 --> 51:41.360
community. The kind of people that go into science, I mean, this is what bothers me with the current

51:41.360 --> 51:49.200
distrust of science, is they might be naive. They might not, especially modern science,

51:49.200 --> 51:54.400
look at the big picture, philosophical, ethical questions, all that kind of stuff. But ultimately,

51:54.400 --> 52:02.640
they're people with integrity and just a deep curiosity for the discovery of cool little things.

52:02.640 --> 52:12.560
And there's no malevolence, broadly speaking, in the scientific community. So I mean, there's a

52:13.520 --> 52:20.320
bigger story here, which is there's a hunger in the populace to discover something anomalous,

52:20.320 --> 52:31.200
something new. And science has to be both open to the anomalous, but also to reject the anomalous

52:31.200 --> 52:37.040
when the data doesn't support it. What do you make of that walk in that line for you? Because you're

52:37.040 --> 52:41.040
dealing with UFO encounters, you're dealing with the anomalous.

52:41.040 --> 52:47.920
Well, people have said, let's go back to the Atacama case, that I was debunking it. Well,

52:47.920 --> 52:54.400
debunking is a loaded term. It sort of assumes that you were going in purposefully to prove

52:54.400 --> 53:02.640
something is wrong. I wasn't, I was just going in to collect the data. And I showed the data,

53:02.640 --> 53:10.720
the data. And I showed that this one was human. There was another skull that somebody had at one

53:10.720 --> 53:15.680
point. It was called the star child. They called it the star child skull. I said, I looked at it.

53:15.680 --> 53:22.800
I looked at the DNA sequencing that they had done. I said, this is human. End of story. The people

53:22.800 --> 53:28.800
who owned the thing at the time disagreed with me. And then eventually another group came in and

53:28.800 --> 53:34.960
proved that I was right. And it's not about debunking. It's about getting the more spectacular

53:34.960 --> 53:39.920
and hyped cases off the table. I mean, the reason I got interested in it is because somebody was

53:39.920 --> 53:44.960
hyping it. And not because I wanted to disprove it, but because I just wanted to know and thus

53:44.960 --> 53:51.040
get it off the table. Cause it's usually the most extravagant things that are most likely to be

53:51.040 --> 53:58.880
wrong. Somewhere in the rubble will be something interesting. And so that's what you do. You get

53:58.880 --> 54:06.000
the, you get the, the, the dross off the table and then somewhere in the data will be something worth

54:07.760 --> 54:14.400
real inquiry. And that if you inquire deeply enough will be extravagant as well. Yes,

54:14.400 --> 54:17.280
exactly. And that's what actually excites scientists is to, I mean,

54:18.240 --> 54:23.360
you want with the rigor of science to actually reveal the extravagant.

54:23.920 --> 54:30.480
And so look at CRISPR as probably the most perfect example of that. These weird sequences

54:30.480 --> 54:37.040
in bacterial genomes all arrayed one after the other with these strange sequences around them.

54:37.040 --> 54:42.800
But when you looked at the sequences, they looked like viruses. And so how did they get there? And

54:42.800 --> 54:47.920
lo and behold, after, you know, a lot of effort and work, well, a couple of Nobel prizes went out

54:47.920 --> 54:56.400
the door, but these strange things ended up having extraordinarily extravagant possibilities.

54:57.680 --> 55:03.040
You've also looked at UFO materials. You are in possession of UFO materials yourself.

55:03.680 --> 55:10.880
Claimed UFO materials, alleged, alleged UFO materials. That's right. So what's another

55:10.880 --> 55:18.560
term? Weird materials that don't seem to have a story. They have a story that doesn't seem

55:18.560 --> 55:26.560
to be of natural origins, but it's not, you know, there's a process to proving that. And that

55:26.560 --> 55:33.120
process may take decades, if not centuries, because you have to keep pulling at the string

55:33.120 --> 55:37.840
and discover where they could possibly come from. But anyway, you, you're in possession of some

55:38.080 --> 55:46.000
materials of this kind. Can you describe some of them and maybe also talk to the process of

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
how you investigate them? How do you analyze them? Right. So let's say that there's two classes of

55:52.000 --> 55:57.120
materials that I've been given by people and not given by like the government or anything,

55:57.120 --> 56:01.920
just given people who've collected them. And there's a reasonable chain of evidence associated

56:01.920 --> 56:05.760
with them that you believe it's not just a pebble somebody picked up off a road.

56:05.760 --> 56:11.760
There are almost always things that people have claimed have either been dropped off as like some

56:11.760 --> 56:23.040
sort of a leftover material, molten metals, or they are from an object that was released from this,

56:23.040 --> 56:29.120
so that kind of exploded. They're almost always metals. I have some couple of things that might

56:29.120 --> 56:33.280
be biological that are interesting that I haven't really spent a lot of time on yet, but I think

56:33.680 --> 56:38.880
are interesting that I haven't really spent a lot of time on yet. When you look at a metal,

56:38.880 --> 56:45.280
you basically, well, okay, what are the elements in it? And what's it made of? And so there's

56:45.280 --> 56:50.560
pretty standard approaches to doing that. Most of them involve a technology called mass spectrometry.

56:51.360 --> 56:54.800
And there's probably about five or six different kinds of mass spectrometry that you could bring

56:54.800 --> 57:00.800
to bear on answering it. And they either tell you depending upon the limit of the resolution

57:00.800 --> 57:06.000
of the instrument, they either tell you the elements that are there, or they tell you the

57:06.000 --> 57:10.480
isotopes that are there. And you're interested not just in knowing whether something is there or not,

57:10.480 --> 57:19.680
you're interested in knowing whether there are the amounts of it. And in the case of elements,

57:20.800 --> 57:25.760
how many different isotopes are there? And that's kind of where in some of these cases,

57:25.760 --> 57:32.160
it gets interesting, right? Because in at least one of the materials, as we first studied it,

57:32.160 --> 57:38.960
the isotope ratios of in this case, it was magnesium are way off normal. And I just don't

57:38.960 --> 57:49.040
know why. It doesn't prove anything. All it proves is that it was probably accomplished by some kind

57:49.120 --> 57:56.000
of an industrial process. Whether it's the result of a process or whether, and this is sort of the

57:56.000 --> 58:03.600
leftover, or whether it was made that way for a particular purpose, I don't know. All I know is

58:03.600 --> 58:16.960
that it was engineered. That's it, right? But then the question is, sort of you go one step deeper,

58:16.960 --> 58:25.120
why would you engineer it? Right. And what does engineered means? There's all kinds of,

58:25.840 --> 58:33.440
it could be a byproduct, it could be the main result of an engineering process,

58:34.000 --> 58:41.360
it would be a small part of the engineering process that is the main part. Well, so the ratios

58:41.360 --> 58:46.560
of isotopes for any given element are basically the result of stellar processes.

58:48.480 --> 58:53.760
Supernova blew up sometime several tens, you know, several billion years ago,

58:55.440 --> 59:01.520
that became a cloud, those atoms coalesced gravitationally to form another sun

59:02.720 --> 59:10.960
and a ring that became a rocky planet. And the ratios of the isotopes were determined

59:10.960 --> 59:18.320
at the time of that explosion. And so everything in the local solar system is more or less of that

59:19.040 --> 59:26.240
ratio depending upon certain gravitational difference, but by fragments of a percent,

59:26.240 --> 59:34.000
not whole tens of percent difference. So what do humans use isotopes for? Mostly to blow stuff up.

59:34.000 --> 59:40.000
I mean, the vast majority of the isotopes that have been made in the per pound or ton

59:40.560 --> 59:46.800
are things like certain ratios of plutonium and uranium to blow stuff up. We don't make

59:47.840 --> 59:53.280
or engineer isotopes, which today is relatively easy to do, but it's still expensive.

59:53.920 --> 01:00:02.880
For any other reason, apart from, let's say, as anti-cancer, we use stable isotopes in money

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.880
these days as a counterfeiting tool. You basically embed certain ratios of isotopes in to make it

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:16.560
harder for counterfeiters to accomplish. But other than that, we don't do anything with that.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:23.840
So why would you make grams of such material in this one case and drop it around on a beach

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:31.440
in Brazil? So which case are we talking about? This is the Uvotuba case. Can you describe this

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.000
case a little bit further, like what material we're talking about, just the full story of the case?

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.440
It's an interesting one.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:45.120
It's an interesting one. So a fisherman saw an object that released something or it exploded.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:55.120
I've got some big chunks of it, relatively pure magnesium with obviously something else in it

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:01.600
because magnesium burns. So it had something in it that would, other metals, simple alloy,

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.440
that would prevent it from basically burning up.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.920
So then we had two pieces that came from two different chains of custody, both

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:23.040
claimed to be from the same object. At least physically when you look at the two things,

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:30.880
they look the same. So we took small fragments of each of them. We put them in an instrument

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.840
called a secondary ion mass spec, which is an extremely sensitive instrument.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:46.000
And you can see down to 0.0001 mass units, which is important for, let's say, more arcane reasons,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.760
but it's a sensitive instrument. And so one of the chains of custody, we had two pieces from the

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.920
same chain of custody and then two pieces from the other chain of custody. One of them had

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:07.280
completely normal magnesium isotope ratios, magnesium 24, 25, 26. And the other was off,

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.280
not just slightly off, way off. And they were both off to the same extent.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.880
So, I mean, it was sort of like you had an internal control of what was normal and you

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:26.720
had this other one which was wrong. And so you're left with kind of an open question.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.520
Was this a hoax? Were these two chains of custody, one of them a hoax, that somebody

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:37.600
purposefully introduced those things? Because you could do it. It would cost a lot. I mean,

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:44.240
at the time that this was found, I guess the 1970s or so, it might have been earlier, I forget,

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.400
the amount that I had would have cost several tens of thousands of dollars to make.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:57.680
And again, it's not something you would just throw around. And why would you do it in the hope that

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:05.040
some guy 30 years from then would pick it up and study it? Yeah, it's a very subtle, subtle troll.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:13.280
It's a long-term plan. So I just don't know what to make of it, except it's interesting.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:21.440
But a different kind of question that you're asking is what constitutes evidence, right?

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:30.320
So is this sufficient evidence? Absolutely not. But somebody's put it forward. I have the time.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:37.360
It's my time. I'll study it. And my objective is to sort of take those that I think are credible

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:42.320
enough and do a reasonable analysis, put it out there, and maybe somebody else will come up with

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:50.160
an idea as to what it is. Now, what would be better is some sort of true technology,

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:59.680
something that is obviously, we don't have it. And people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and Seth

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:10.720
Shostak have come out rightfully and have said, when you show up with something really obviously

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:17.280
technology that we don't understand, then we'll pay attention, right? Not just material. Not

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:25.920
just material. A piece of metal is interesting. And several of the things that I've looked at

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:33.600
and other things that people have come to me with, we found to be completely banal or were actually

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:40.480
pieces of aircraft that were invented back in the 1940s. And so take them off the table.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:49.600
But I think, again, I think showing up with technology that we humans would find completely

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:56.000
novel is actually a really difficult task for aliens, because it obviously can't be so novel

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:59.040
that we don't recognize it. For what it is, yeah.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.360
For what it is. And I would say most of the technology aliens likely have

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:10.240
would be something we don't recognize. So it's actually a hard problem how to convince

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:19.120
ants. You first have to understand what ants are tweeting about, what they care about in order to

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:27.360
inject into their culture. Because that's why I think it would be the technology that you could

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:35.120
present is in the space of ideas, is trying to influence individual humans with the encounters

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:43.200
and try to with this kind of thing that you mentioned about us not taking messages about us

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:50.080
not taking care of the world. It's difficult. I mean, for them to understand, you have to come

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:57.200
up with trinkets that impress us. I mean, maybe the very technology, the fascination with the

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.480
development of technology and the development of technology, the actual act of innovation itself

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.840
is the thing that they're communicating. Right.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:10.240
I mean, this is kind of what Jacques Vallee thinks about is the role of

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:17.200
control system. He calls it the control system. Well, let me ask about Jacques. Who is he?

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:26.080
You know him. Who is Jacques Vallee? What have you learned from him about life?

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:32.480
About UFOs, about technology, about our role in the universe?

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:42.080
Well, I met Jacques actually soon after the whole Atacama thing happened. I was visited by those

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:48.480
people associated with the government and the whatever around the Havana, what ended up

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.400
mostly being Havana syndrome patients, but also Jacques at the same time. And they were actually

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:58.080
working behind the scenes with each other that, oh, here's this Stanford professor who is willing

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:04.720
to talk about this stuff and investigate things. Maybe we should go talk to him. And he reached out

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:12.320
through a colleague and, you know, I had lunch actually at the Rosewood Inn up on near Sandhill.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:21.920
So Jacques is one of the first openly active scientists and he's really a scientist in this

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:33.200
area going back to the 1960s. And, you know, he's put forward a number of ideas, speculations about

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.160
what it might be that people are interacting with. And he, the first thing that I learned from him

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:44.560
is this notion of what he called Kabuki theater. That many of the things that people have seen

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.960
are, I remember reading his books and thinking he uses this word absurd a lot.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:57.680
He said the things that people claim they see are absurd, right? A ship doesn't land

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:03.760
in a farmer's field and then come up and knock on the door and say, can I have a glass of water?

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:09.920
And these are stories literally out of newspapers from the 1930s. It's absurd. You know, and the

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:14.880
other thing that people say ships don't crash. If you're so technologically advanced, you don't

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:26.240
crash. It's absurd that they crash. So he says this is put on as a show. It's an influence

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:33.600
campaign, right? It's not meant to influence individuals. It's meant to influence a culture

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.560
as a whole. Maybe they don't look at us as individuals. Maybe they look at us as

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:46.320
an organism that lives on a planet, right? And perhaps rightly so. And so that's how you

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:50.640
interact with them. That's how you influence them. So that was one of the first things that kind of

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:57.040
took me back and realized, wow, there's actually a, maybe there's a puppet master behind the scenes

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:05.040
that's doing this influencing that all this stuff about aliens is just is not true per se.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.480
They're just a representation of something that is meant to influence. So that was probably the

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.840
most interesting. I mean, the man is brilliant. He's also, it can be, and I'm sorry, Jacques,

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:22.240
he can also be incredibly annoying to have a conversation with because he will pick apart

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:27.520
your arguments or anything that you think you know, and show you why you don't know what you

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:34.960
think you know. And he uses the, he used the example that for me, that is, is all you need

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:43.760
is one counter example to any conclusion and you're wrong. And so I learned from him, I mean,

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:49.360
I'm supposed to be a good scientist, but I learned from him, don't talk about conclusions, just talk

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.320
about the data because data is not wrong. I mean, convince yourself that the data is not wrong or

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:58.560
not an artifact, but be careful about your conclusions because whatever is going on,

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.000
it's, it's much more complicated than we, than we imagine.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.360
Wow. That's powerful. Being able to always step back as we get, we humans get excited.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.840
Yeah. We start to jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back. Well,

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.560
being able to always step back as we get, we humans get excited. Yeah. We start to

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.280
jump to conclusions from the data, but always step back. Well, in some of my Twitter feeds,

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.360
when I dare to go on Twitter are full of, well, when are you going to give us the answer?

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:32.160
You know, science is not immediate. You've got to have to be patient. And even some of my science

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.760
colleagues have said, well, where's the data? My answer to them has been, where's been your work

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.160
to try to produce any, you know, I'm not here to give you everything on a silver platter.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:49.280
We talked offline how much I love data and machine learning and so on. And it's been really

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.240
disheartening to see that the U S government not invest as much as they possibly could into this

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:01.440
whole process. So let's jump to the most recent thing, which is what do you make of the report

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:08.800
titled preliminary assessment on identified aerial phenomena that was released by the office of the

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:16.800
director of national intelligence in June, 2021. So this was like, okay, we're going to step back

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.360
and we're going to like, what, where do we stand and where do we hope the future is?

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.720
What do you make of that report? Is it hopeful? Is it, I see it as very helpful, very helpful.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:31.920
I think the adults are finally stepping up in and being in charge. Right. I mean,

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.000
it's sense of adult. What's that in the good sense, in the good sense of adult.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.800
Childlike curiosity is pretty powerful thing. That's true. Yeah. I, it's, but it's also,

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:48.400
I think the people who were worried that the populace at large might run screaming into the

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.240
streets and riot, uh, you know, have, you know, they basically, the empiric evidence is they're

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:59.600
wrong. You know, this, these videos and all these things have been out for now, what five years,

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:06.160
most people don't even know about it. Right. So as, as, as hyped as it's been and all over the

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:12.080
newspapers that it's been and et cetera, you know, even Tucker Carlson has talked about it many times

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:17.680
on his news program. Um, Joe Rogan has a lot of people don't know about it. So I think people,

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.160
if it's not affecting their day-to-day life, they're going on with their day-to-day life.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:31.200
So, but that said, I think it was an important sea change in the internal discussions going on

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:38.640
in the government because, and the reason being that I think this is actually partly true with

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:46.320
the, the maturation of human social technology, it was becoming so obvious that this stuff was

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.640
showing up again and again and again around our ships. They just couldn't keep it quiet anymore.

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.680
Right. And so it's like, we need to do something about it. And Lou Elizondo and Chris and others,

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:01.520
to their great credit, found the right angle to talk about this. It says, well,

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.880
okay, let's say it's not out there. Maybe it's the Russians, the Chinese or somebody else.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:15.520
We should know about this because we damn sure know it's not us. So that to me is an important

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:23.200
thing to, to finally be a little bit more open about the matter. But like I often say, I'm not

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.600
looking for people to give me permission to do anything. I'm just going to do the analysis

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:33.120
myself with what I have. Avi Loeb has taken the same approach. He said, I'm not going to wait for

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:40.480
the government to give me telescopic information about technologies or things that might be even

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:46.080
on our own solar system. I'm just going to collect it myself. And, and that's the right way to do it.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:51.760
Right. Don't wait for somebody else to give it to you. It's also possible to inspire a large

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:57.120
number of people to do a wider spread data collection. Yes. I mean, you yourself can't

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.800
do a large enough data collection that would, if you're talking about anomalous events,

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:10.480
right. Right. You should be collecting high resolution data about everything that's happening

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:18.080
on earth in terms of like, in terms of the kind of things that would indicate to you a strong signal

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:24.960
that something weird happened here. And this is why, you know, governments can be good at funding

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.840
large scale efforts. Yes. I mean, you know, NASA and, and so on working with SpaceX with Blue Origin

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:40.640
you know, fund capitalistic sort of fund companies, fund company efforts to do

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:46.480
huge moonshot projects. Right. And in the same way do huge moonshot data collection efforts in

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:52.800
terms of UFOs. I mean, we're not, it needs to be like 10X, like one or two orders of magnitude more

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.920
funding. Exactly. To do this kind of thing. And I understand on the flip side of that, if you make

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:03.440
it about what are the Russians, whether the Chinese doing, you know, make it a question of

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:10.560
geopolitics, it gets touchy because now you, you kind of taken away from the realm of science

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.920
and making it military, making it military. Some of the greatest, this is what makes me as an

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:22.720
engineer, makes me truly sad that some of the greatest engineering work ever done is by Lockheed

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:29.680
Martin and we will never know about it. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I wish we were, it was different,

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:37.680
but it's the world we live in. You know, but related to that UAP task force announcement that

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.560
you just said, you know, the bill was passed in the department of defense and now a formally

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:51.120
establishes an office to collate that information and also to be transparent about it. Money is now

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:57.120
set aside, right? What do you think of just in case people don't know, the DOD established a new

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:05.440
department to study UFOs called airborne naming. Come on. But yes, airborne object identification

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.000
and management synchronization group. Hey, do you know how to pronounce that? No, I do not know.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:19.920
It's stupid and needs to be renamed, but AOI MSG. AOI is directed by the undersecretary of defense

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:25.760
for intelligence and security. What do you make of this office? Do you, are you hopeful about this

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.720
office? I think there's still a tug of war going on behind the scenes as to who's going to control

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:40.480
this. But I do know though that money has been set aside that will be used to make things

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:48.720
more public, right? To start to get others involved. And you know, there's, I'm involved

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:53.440
with an effort to get other academics involved. So you think there might be some of that money

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:59.040
could be directed towards funding, maybe like groups like yours to do some research here.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.480
So they would be open to that, you think? I hope so. I mean, nothing is set in stone yet. So,

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:08.960
you know, and I'm not hiding anything because I just don't know anything, right? But I do,

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:18.320
I do think that there will be public efforts. Now there are being set up other private efforts

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:25.520
to bring monies involved and to use that to leverage and get access to some of the

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:32.640
internal resources as well. So what you're seeing is kind of an ecosystem building up

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:40.960
in a positive sense of people who are willing to do the research. So, you know, before it,

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:44.000
it would be, you couldn't even go to a scientist and ask them to help.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.160
Now, if there's money, as I said before, scientists are essentially capitalists. We

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:54.720
go where the money is, you know, I mean, the work that I've done, I did out of my own pocket

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:03.120
and probably about 50, 60, $70,000 of money went into the paper we published out of my own pocket.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.600
And, you know, but the amount of money that needs to go in is in the, in at least the few millions

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:16.880
to do a proper analysis of these materials. The work I know that the Galileo project is involved

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:23.760
with, it's probably in the, in the, you know, five to 10 million range to get stuff done. But

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.520
that's actually a relatively modest amount of money to accomplish something that has been in

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:37.280
the zeitgeist for decades. I should also push back a little bit on something you probably will

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:42.640
agree with. You said scientists are essentially capitalists. What I've noticed is there's

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:47.120
certainly an influence of money. But oftentimes when you're talking about basic research and

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:54.800
basic science, the money is a little bit, a little bit ambiguous to what direction you're

01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:01.120
doing the research in. And the scientists get really good at telling a narrative of like,

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:06.000
yeah, yeah, yeah, we're fulfilling the purpose of this funding, but we're actually,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.960
they end up doing really what they're curious about. And of course you cannot deviate like

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.200
if you're getting funded to study penguins in Antarctica, you can't start building rockets,

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.400
but probably you can because you'll convince some kind of, you'll concoct the narrative saying

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:26.960
rockets are really important for studying penguins in the Antarctic. I think that's actually,

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:34.480
this is one thing I think people don't generally understand about the scientific mind is I don't

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:39.440
know how capitalistic it is because if it was, they would start an effing company.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:45.760
No, no, no, no. I mean, when I meant capitalist, I didn't mean in the, they'll start companies per

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:52.560
se. I mean, we can only do the research where there's money. And so from, you know, maybe it's

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:59.760
a bad use of the term capitalist. But we will only do the research where there's money. I mean,

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:07.840
why do most people work, many biologists work in cancer research? Because there's a lot of money

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:14.320
there. It's an important problem, but I might not have ever gotten involved in it if there

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:21.040
wasn't money. I might've gone and I was going to be a botanist when I was a kid. That's what I

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:29.840
wanted to do. So having money available will bring people to bear. Now, another mistake

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:35.040
that's often actually made, I think by the lay public about science is that people think that

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:40.800
we're paid to do things. Just as you said, I get a research grant and luckily from the NIH,

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:45.600
they give you a fair amount of latitude. I will go my own way and I'll find something,

01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.920
I might've proposed something, but I'll end up somewhere entirely different

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.480
by the end of the project. And that's how good science is done. You follow the data,

01:20:54.480 --> 01:21:03.040
you follow the results. And so that's what I'm hoping can be done here. I think the worst kind

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:09.760
of thing that could be done with this subject area is to put it inside another company where

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:15.360
they have a set plan of what it is they're going to do and the scientists either do what the

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.320
executives tell them to do or not. That isn't how anything will really get discovered.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:28.160
Get it out into the public, get open minds thinking about it and then publishing on it

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:32.720
and doing the right kind of work. That's how real progress will be made with this.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:39.600
Let's again, put our sort of philosophical hats on. Do you think the US government or some other

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:49.040
government is in possession of something of extraterrestrial origin that is far more impressive

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:53.280
than anything we've seen in the public?

01:21:54.560 --> 01:22:01.280
I've not seen anything personally, but if I believe the people who I don't think can lie, yes.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:08.320
How does that make you feel in terms of the way government works, the way our human civilization

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:15.200
works, that there might be things like that and they're not public? Is there a hopeful message

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:21.920
for transparency that's possible? If you were in power, and I'm not saying president because

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:29.520
maybe the president is not the source of power here, would you release this information in some

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:38.240
way or form? Yes, if I were. I think it's something that can bring humanity together.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:47.120
Right? I think that knowledge of this kind of thing to know that we are more alike than we

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:55.600
are different in comparison to whatever this is, is a positive thing for us.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:03.760
I don't necessarily care that the government has been hiding it and I think people who've been

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.440
talking about we should give government officials or whatever amnesty, I think that's probably the

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:16.320
right answer. This isn't a time to look back and say you did something wrong. You did whatever you

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:20.160
did because that was the data you had available to you at the time and you had good reasons for

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:26.160
doing it. Now, if your reasons were selfish, if your reasons were you wanted to do it because

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:33.520
you wanted to monetize it yourself to your benefit but against that of others, then I think maybe

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.520
there's something else that could be said. An opportunity to get all this information out,

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:46.480
if I were in charge, I would try to do it. Now, I might be shown something though that says,

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.640
there's a reason why you don't want to let anybody know this. Maybe you don't want everybody

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:58.160
having access to unlimited energy because maybe you might turn it into a bomb. Or something that

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:03.920
gives you hints that something like unlimited energy is possible but you haven't figured it

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:10.000
out yet. If you make it public, maybe some of the other governments you have tensions with

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.120
will figure it out first. Right. It's kind of an arms race going on, I think.

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:24.560
In all forms. It makes me truly sad because it's obvious that, for example, the origins of the

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:32.320
COVID virus, it's obvious to me that the Chinese government, whatever the origins are, is interested

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:39.200
in not releasing information about it because it can only be bad for the Chinese government.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:46.560
Every government thinks like this. This has been a disappointment to me

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:54.880
talking to PR folks at companies. They're always nervous. They're always conservative

01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:02.560
in the sense like, well, if we release more stuff, it can only be bad. Then an Elon Musk

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:10.640
character comes along who tweets ridiculous memes and doesn't give a fuck. I've been encouraging

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:15.680
I've been encouraging CEOs. I've been encouraging people to be transparent. Of course,

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.360
government and national security is really another level. It's human lives at stake.

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.680
Let's start at the lighter case of just releasing some of the awesome

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.520
insights of how the sausage is made, the technology, and being transparent about it.

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:43.520
It excites people. Like you said, it connects people. It inspires them. It's good for the

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.480
brand. It's good for everybody. I honestly think this kind of idea that people will steal the

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:56.400
information and we use it against you is an idea that's not true and is the idea of the 20th

01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:02.480
century. Like you said, some of the benefits of the social media, our social world is that

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.920
transparency is beneficial. I hope governments will learn that lesson. Of course, they're usually

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:14.720
the last to learn such lessons. What do you make of Bob Lazar's story in terms of possession of

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.120
aircraft? Do you believe him? I don't believe in the Bob Lazar story, to be quite honest.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:31.280
Jeremy Corbell has done a great job interviewing him and has done some beautiful documentaries.

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:45.360
I don't know how to interpret it. Again, some of the people who I fraternize with think it's all

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:54.640
rubbish. Maybe he's right, but I don't know. The problem is, and this is a little bit different

01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:00.320
about how I approach the whole area than a lot of others, I'm less interested in going over

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:07.680
old paperwork and all these old histories of who said what, the whole he said, she said of the

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:18.000
history of UFOs. I'm a scientist. I worked on the brain area because it's something I can collect

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.040
data on. I can go back to the same individual, collect their MRI again, and redo it. I can

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:28.560
hand that MRI to somebody else. They can analyze it. I can get materials. I can analyze them.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.600
I can get some of these skeletons. I won't touch any skeletons ever again,

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.360
but I can analyze it and somebody else can reproduce the data. That's what I'm good at.

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.880
I'm not going to go into the whole... I'm not a historian.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.080
Yeah, that's true, but there's a human side to it.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:55.120
Sometimes I think with these, because again, anomalous, rare events, some of the data is

01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:01.120
inextricably connected to humans, the observations. I mean, I hope in the future

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:11.600
that sensory data will not be polluted by human subjectivity, but that's still powerful data,

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:17.280
even direct observations, like if you talk about pilots. So it's an interesting question to me

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:22.960
whether Babazar is telling the truth, whether he believes he's telling the truth too, and what

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:29.200
also what impact his story and stories like his have on the willingness of governments

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:38.240
to be transparent and so on. So you have to credit his story for captivating the imagination

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:43.360
of people and getting the conversation going. He's maintained his story for all these years

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:49.440
with little to no change that I'm aware of. But there's so many other people who are,

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.360
let's say, experts in that story.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:29:02.720
Their gut, you accumulate a set of circumstantial evidence where your gut will say that

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:09.920
somebody is not telling the truth. You mentioned Avi Loeb. I forgot to ask you about Omoumuah.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:18.240
Because you've analyzed specimens here on Earth, what do you make of that one? And what do you make

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:25.600
broadly of our efforts to look at rocks, essentially, or look at objects flying around

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:34.480
in our solar system? Is that a valuable pursuit or maybe most of the fascinating things can be

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:42.560
discovered here on Earth or on other nearby planets? Just going to Omoumuah, I think Avi's

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:50.320
insight is an interesting speculation. Like I was saying before, people can sometimes look

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:55.280
at something and not see it for what it is. Many would just look at that and say,

01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:01.520
oh, it's an asteroid and dismiss it. There was something odd about the data that Avi picked up

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:07.920
on and said, well, here's an alternative explanation that actually better fits the models

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:16.160
than it just being a rock. And to his credit, he just has ignored the critics because he

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:22.000
believes the data is real and is using that then as a battering ram to go after other things.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.920
So I think that's great. Yeah. What is his main conclusion? Does he say

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:34.800
it could be of alien extraterrestrial origin? Well, that's one of the things. He's explained

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:42.720
how it could be a light sail. And a light sail is certainly within near human capabilities

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:49.840
to make such a thing. I think Yuri Milner, he's a Russian billionaire. He's involved,

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:59.360
I think, in a project to make light sails with laser, to launch them with laser power,

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:08.640
essentially, towards Alpha Centauri. So it's something that humans could make. I think Avi's

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.960
proposal is perfectly within the realm of possibility. Sadly, the thing is

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:19.520
now nearly out of our solar system. Yes. To me, that's inspiring to do greater

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:24.560
levels of data collection in our solar system, but also here on Earth. It just seems like we

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:29.600
should be constantly collecting data because the tools of software that we're developing

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.600
get better and better at dealing with huge amounts of data. It's changing the nature of science.

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:41.440
Collect all of the data. Right. Collect the data. The Galileo project asked me over the weekend

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:47.120
to join, and I did. So I'm not a specialist in any of the stuff that they're doing,

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:54.160
but in looking at the list of people who are on there, there are really no biologists on

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:59.600
there. So at some point, if my expertise is required for something... What's the goal and

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:04.640
the vision of the Galileo project? Better talk to Avi, but my understanding, and just actually

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:12.480
looking at the sort of the bylaws this morning, literally just got them, is number one, collect

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:22.000
the data on UAP, and number two, collect data on local, potentially local technological artifacts.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.280
I need to look into this. This is fascinating. Avi is heading the Galileo project. Yeah. Have

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:33.520
you spoken to him? On this podcast, yes. I believe it was before he was headed. Is this a new creation?

01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:37.680
Yeah. The Galileo project was... I think it's about six or seven months old now.

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:40.800
Okay. That's amazing. And he's getting a group of scientists together.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:47.280
Oh, yeah. About a hundred. Oh, actually, I was looking at some of their stuff over the weekend.

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.640
I'm shocked at the level of organization that they've already got put together.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:56.000
That's amazing. It looks like a moonshot project. I mean, I've been involved with a lot of NIH,

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.880
large NIH projects, which involve a lot of people in coordination, and they're putting it together.

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:15.040
So you're extremely well published in a lot of the fields we began this conversation with.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:22.880
So you're a legit scientist, but yet you're keeping an open mind to a lot of ideas that

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:33.520
maybe require you to take a leap outside of the conventional. So what advice would you give to

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:43.200
young people today that are in high school or in college that are dreaming of having impact in

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:49.120
science or maybe in whatever career path that goes outside of the conventional, that really

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:56.080
does something new? If you believe in something, you believe that an idea is

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:04.400
valuable, or you haven't approached something, don't let others shame you into not doing it.

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:11.680
As I've said, shame is a societal control device to get other people to do what

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:18.400
they want you to do rather than what you want to do. So shame sometimes is good to stop you

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:24.720
from doing something unethical or wrong, but shame also is something that is circumscribing

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:32.880
your environment. I've never let people who've told me, you shouldn't do that line of science,

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.520
you should be ashamed of yourself for even thinking that. Give me a break.

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:42.320
I'm, you know, why is it wrong to ask questions about this area? What's wrong with asking the

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:48.640
question? Frankly, you're the person who's wrong for trying to stop these questions.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:54.640
You're the person who's almost acting like a cultist. You basically have closed your mind

01:34:55.280 --> 01:35:00.800
to what the possibilities are. And if I'm not hurting anybody, and if it could lead to an

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:06.400
advance, and if it's my time, why does it bother you? I mean, I had a very well-known

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.480
scientist once tell me that I was going to hurt my career talking about this.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:15.840
If anything, it's enhanced my career. I have a couple of questions on this. So first of all,

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:23.040
just a small comment on that. I've realized that it feels like a lot of the progress in science

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.960
is done by people pursuing an idea that another senior faculty would probably say,

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:34.000
this is going to hurt your career. I think it's actually a pretty good indicator that there's

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:40.480
something interesting when a senior wise person tells you this is going to hurt your career.

01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.200
I think that's just the one as a small, if I were to give advice to young people,

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:49.680
if somebody's senior tells you this is going to hurt your career, think twice about taking their

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:57.360
advice. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the primary thing. And the other I tell my own students,

01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:04.080
I have a lab of about 20, 30 people and it's been that big since 1992, people come and go,

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:16.160
it's not the data that falls in line that's so interesting. It's the spot off the graph

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:24.880
that you want to understand. When something is way off the graph, that's the interesting thing,

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:30.640
because that's usually where discovery is. And the number of times that I've stopped people in

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.320
my lab and said, wait a second, go back a few slides. What was that? And then it ended up

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:43.120
being something interesting that made their careers. I could count on a few hands.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:51.040
Yeah. Get excited by the extraordinary that's outside of the thing that you've done in the past.

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:54.800
Right. Just on a personal psychological level,

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:03.920
I'm sure at Stanford, I'm sure in you exploring some of these ideas, there's pressure.

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:14.560
How do you not give in to the pressure? How do you not give in to the people that push you away from

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:24.080
these topics? What would you say is shame? I just point to my successes. You're the ones who told

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:30.240
me not to start companies all this time ago. And now you're the one coming to me for advice

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:41.520
for how to start a company. But from the scientific area, it's you're wanting to take something off

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:52.000
the table that might be an explanation. How is that the scientific method? I reverse shame them.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.120
Reverse shame them. So purely with reason through conversation, you're able to do that. So it doesn't

01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:02.080
feel, because to me, it would just feel lonely. There's a community. There's a community of

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:09.360
science. And when you're working on something that's outside a particular conventional way

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:17.040
of thinking, it can be lonely. In the AI field, if you're working on neural networks in the 90s,

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.560
it could be lonely. I have met some of the most fascinating people ever that had I stayed the

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:30.080
conventional track, I would never have met. I mean, truly brilliant people because of this.

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:40.160
So it is for those worried about, well, should I step outside of my comfort zone,

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:45.520
you're going to meet some really interesting people. And because I'm open about this area,

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:54.240
I'll go and give a talk in Boston, Harvard, or MIT. And at dinner, inevitably,

01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:00.800
this subject comes up. And inevitably, somebody else at the table will admit both that they're

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.120
interested or that they've seen something. And suddenly the whole tone of the conversation

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:13.360
changes. It's kind of like there's safety in numbers. Or I've had people come to me afterwards

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:22.960
after dinner and say, hey, I don't talk about this openly. So the number of scientists who know that

01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:31.120
there's something else going on is much larger than the scientific community would like to think.

01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:39.040
That's a really powerful one, which is I don't talk about this openly. But here's what I believe.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:46.000
And you'd be surprised how many people speak like this and hold those beliefs. And I am optimistic

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.760
about social media and a more connected world to reveal more and more, like us not to have these

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:57.600
two personalities. We're like this public and private one. We've mentioned the big questions

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:01.840
of the origins of the universe. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:10.000
For us humans, our human existence here on Earth, or just at the individual level of a human life?

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:20.480
What, Gary, is the meaning of life? I think that what we're going through today with this

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:30.800
realization, it's kind of like you've lived on an island your whole life and you've looked across

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.520
the ocean and you've never imagined there was another island with anybody else on it. And then

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:43.360
suddenly a ship with sails shows up. You don't understand it, but you realize that suddenly

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:49.360
your world just got a lot bigger. I think we're in one of those moments right now that our world

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:56.640
view, our galactic view, is opening to something a little bit bigger. And not just

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:04.640
that there might be somebody else, but that there's something else and what it is

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:10.160
is yet to be understood. And the fact that it isn't understood to me is what's exciting

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:19.200
because I can fill it with my dreams. And this discovery, our world might,

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:27.600
is about to get a lot more humbling and a lot more fascinating once we look out

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:33.440
and realize we were on an island all along. It makes us both smaller but larger at the same time

01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:42.560
to me. I can look outside at the stars and think and imagine what else might be out there.

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:48.240
And although I know that I will never see it all, it excites me to know that it's there.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:56.400
Well, Gary, both to respect your time and also because at 12 I turned into a princess,

01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:04.480
let me just say thank you for doing everything you're doing as a great scientist,

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:10.480
as a person willing to reject the conventional. And thank you for spending your extremely valuable

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:13.760
time with me today. Thanks for talking. Thanks so much. It was great talking.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.480
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Gary Nolan. To support this podcast,

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:23.840
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:29.920
Stanislav Lem in Solaris. How do you expect to communicate with the ocean

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:38.080
when we can't even understand one another? Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:54.000
you
