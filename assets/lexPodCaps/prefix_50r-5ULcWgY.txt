00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
There's no reason to think that the ocean ends

00:02.200 --> 00:03.760
just beyond your horizon.

00:03.760 --> 00:06.760
And likewise, there's no reason to think that

00:06.760 --> 00:10.280
the aftermath of our Big Bang ends

00:10.280 --> 00:12.600
just at the boundary of what we can see.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.080
Indeed, there are quite strong arguments

00:15.080 --> 00:18.200
that it probably goes on about 100 times further.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.560
And it may even go on so much further

00:20.560 --> 00:24.040
that all combinatorials are replicated.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.520
And there's another set of people like us

00:26.520 --> 00:28.280
sitting in a room like this.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.840
The following is a conversation with Lord Martin Rees,

00:33.840 --> 00:36.200
Emeritus Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics

00:36.200 --> 00:37.520
at Cambridge University,

00:37.520 --> 00:40.760
and co-founder of the Center for the Study

00:40.760 --> 00:42.720
of Existential Risk.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.740
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.880
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:46.880 --> 00:48.160
in the description.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.540
And now, dear friends, here's Martin Rees.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.360
In your 2020 Scientific American article,

00:55.360 --> 00:57.120
you write that, quote,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.720
today we know that the universe is far bigger

00:59.720 --> 01:02.280
and stranger than anyone suspected.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.800
So what do you think are the strangest,

01:04.800 --> 01:06.520
maybe the most beautiful,

01:06.520 --> 01:09.340
or maybe even the most terrifying things lurking

01:09.340 --> 01:11.360
out there in the cosmos?

01:11.360 --> 01:14.200
Well, of course, we're still groping for any detailed

01:14.200 --> 01:17.080
understanding of the remote parts of the universe.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.560
But of course, what we've learned in the last few decades

01:21.560 --> 01:22.640
is really two things.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.600
First, we've understood that the universe had an origin

01:26.600 --> 01:29.080
about 13.8 billion years ago

01:29.080 --> 01:32.160
in a so-called Big Bang, a hot, dense state

01:32.160 --> 01:35.080
whose very beginnings are still shrouded in mystery.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.600
And also we've learned more about the extreme things in it,

01:38.600 --> 01:42.960
black holes, neutron stars, explosions of various kinds.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.920
And one of the most potentially exciting discoveries

01:46.920 --> 01:50.120
in the last 20 years, mainly the last 10,

01:50.120 --> 01:54.480
has been the realization that most of the stars in the sky

01:54.520 --> 01:57.000
are orbited by retinues of planets,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.920
just as the sun is orbited by the Earth

01:59.920 --> 02:01.600
and the other familiar planets.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.920
And this of course makes the night sky farmer interesting.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.760
What you see up there aren't just points of light,

02:06.760 --> 02:09.280
but they're planetary systems.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.000
And that raises the question, could there be life out there?

02:12.000 --> 02:16.080
And so that is an exciting problem for the 21st century.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.080
So when you see all those lights out there,

02:18.080 --> 02:21.760
you immediately imagine all the planetary worlds

02:21.760 --> 02:23.920
that are around them.

02:23.960 --> 02:28.320
And they potentially have all kinds of different lives,

02:28.320 --> 02:31.480
living organisms, life forms, or different histories.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.440
Well, that we don't know at all.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.600
We know that these planets are there.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.360
We know that they have masses

02:37.360 --> 02:41.680
and orbits rather like the planets of our solar system.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.800
But we don't know at all if there's any life on any of them.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.000
I mean, it's entirely logically possible

02:47.000 --> 02:49.040
that life is unique to this Earth.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.360
Doesn't exist anywhere.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.440
On the other hand, it could be that the origin of life

02:53.440 --> 02:55.840
is something which happens routinely

02:55.840 --> 02:58.120
given conditions like the young Earth,

02:58.120 --> 02:59.960
in which case there could be literally

02:59.960 --> 03:02.160
billions of places in our galaxy

03:02.160 --> 03:04.280
where some sort of biosphere has evolved.

03:04.280 --> 03:09.280
And settling where the truth lies between those two extremes

03:09.760 --> 03:12.880
is a challenge for the coming decades.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.560
So certainly we're either lucky to be here,

03:16.560 --> 03:19.080
or very, very, very lucky to be here.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.080
I guess that's so, yes.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.240
That's the difference.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.480
Where do you fall?

03:24.480 --> 03:27.360
Your own estimate, your own guess on this question.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.000
Are we alone in the universe, do you think?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.560
I think we're foolish to give any firm estimate

03:32.560 --> 03:34.200
because we just don't know.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.080
And that's just an example

03:36.080 --> 03:39.520
of how we are depending on greater observations.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.520
And also, incidentally, in the case of life,

03:42.520 --> 03:45.760
we've got to take account of the fact that,

03:45.760 --> 03:48.240
as I always say to my scientific colleagues,

03:48.240 --> 03:51.600
biology is a much harder subject than physics.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.680
And most of the universe, as we know about,

03:54.680 --> 03:56.560
could be understood by physics.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.320
But we've got to remember

03:58.320 --> 04:02.240
that even the smallest living organism, an insect,

04:02.240 --> 04:06.480
is far more complicated with layer on layer complexity

04:06.480 --> 04:10.720
than the most complicated star or galaxy.

04:10.720 --> 04:14.920
You know, that's the funny thing about physics and biology.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.800
The dream of physicists in the 20th century,

04:17.800 --> 04:18.920
and maybe this century,

04:18.920 --> 04:22.280
is to discover the theory of everything.

04:22.280 --> 04:27.280
And there's a sense that once you discover that theory,

04:27.920 --> 04:29.960
you will understand everything.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.360
If we unlock the mysteries of how the universe works,

04:32.360 --> 04:36.600
would you be able to understand how life emerges

04:36.600 --> 04:39.760
from that fabric of the universe that we understand?

04:39.760 --> 04:43.240
I think the phrase theory of everything is very misleading

04:43.240 --> 04:46.560
because it's used to describe a theory

04:46.560 --> 04:51.440
which unifies the three laws of microphysics,

04:51.440 --> 04:54.680
electricity, magnetism, and weak interaction with gravity.

04:54.680 --> 04:59.600
So it's an important step forward for particle physicists.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.360
But the lack of such a theory

05:01.360 --> 05:04.040
doesn't hold up any other scientists.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.680
Anyone doing biology or most of physics

05:06.680 --> 05:08.520
is not held up at all

05:08.520 --> 05:10.400
through not understanding sub-nuclear physics.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.120
They're held up because they're dealing with things

05:12.120 --> 05:14.200
that are very complicated.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.920
And that's especially true of anything biological.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.080
So what's holding up biologists

05:19.080 --> 05:22.000
is not a lack of the so-called theory of everything.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.720
It's the inability to understand things

05:24.720 --> 05:26.720
which are very complicated.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.960
What do you think we'll understand first,

05:28.960 --> 05:33.520
how the universe works or how the human body works deeply,

05:33.520 --> 05:35.960
like from a fundamental deep level?

05:35.960 --> 05:38.480
Well, I think, perhaps we can come back to it later,

05:38.480 --> 05:42.600
that there are only limited prospects

05:42.600 --> 05:46.960
of ever being able to understand with unaided human brains

05:46.960 --> 05:50.120
the most fundamental theories linking together

05:50.120 --> 05:51.880
all the forces of nature.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.600
I think that may be a limitation of the human brains.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.480
But I also think that we can,

05:58.480 --> 06:01.840
perhaps aided by computer simulations,

06:01.840 --> 06:06.000
understand a bit more of the complexity of nature.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.280
But even understanding a simple organism

06:09.280 --> 06:12.440
from the atom up is very, very difficult.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.440
And I think extreme reductionists

06:15.440 --> 06:18.360
have a very misleading perception.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.040
They tend to think that, in a sense,

06:21.040 --> 06:24.280
we are all solutions to Schrodinger's equation, et cetera.

06:24.280 --> 06:28.160
But that isn't the way we'll ever understand anything.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.400
It may be true that we are reductionists

06:31.400 --> 06:34.320
in the sense that we believe that that's the case.

06:34.320 --> 06:37.560
We don't believe in any special life force in living things.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.600
But nonetheless, no one thinks

06:39.600 --> 06:41.440
that we can understand a living thing

06:41.480 --> 06:43.760
by solving Schrodinger's equation.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.480
To take an example which isn't as complicated,

06:46.480 --> 06:50.560
lots of people study the flow of fluids like water,

06:50.560 --> 06:52.840
why waves break, why flows go turbulent,

06:52.840 --> 06:53.880
things like that.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.640
This is a serious branch of applied mathematics

06:56.640 --> 06:57.920
and engineering.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.920
And in doing this, you have concepts of viscosity,

07:01.920 --> 07:04.240
turbulence, and things like that.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.240
Now, you can understand quite a lot

07:07.240 --> 07:10.040
about how water behaves and how waves break

07:10.040 --> 07:12.360
in terms of those concepts.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.800
But the fact that any breaking wave

07:15.800 --> 07:18.520
is a solution of Schrodinger's equation

07:18.520 --> 07:20.680
for tens of 30 particles,

07:21.800 --> 07:24.640
even if you could solve that, which you clearly can't,

07:24.640 --> 07:26.240
would not give you any insight.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.880
So the important thing is that every science

07:28.880 --> 07:30.960
has its own irreducible concepts

07:32.160 --> 07:35.120
in which you get the best explanation.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.880
So it may be in chemistry, it's things like valence,

07:38.880 --> 07:43.880
in biology, concepts in cell biology,

07:44.480 --> 07:49.200
and in ecology, there are concepts like imprinting, et cetera.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.440
And in psychology, there are other concepts.

07:52.440 --> 07:57.360
So in a sense, the sciences are like a tall building

07:57.360 --> 08:00.880
where you have basic physics, the most fundamental,

08:00.880 --> 08:03.240
then the rest of physics, then chemistry,

08:03.240 --> 08:06.160
then cell biology, et cetera,

08:06.160 --> 08:08.120
all the way up to the, I guess, economist

08:08.120 --> 08:11.600
and the penthouse and all that, and we have that.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.760
And that's true in a sense,

08:13.760 --> 08:16.960
but it's not true that it's like a building

08:16.960 --> 08:21.440
in that it's made unstable by an unstable base,

08:21.440 --> 08:25.680
because if you're a chemist, biologist, or an economist,

08:25.680 --> 08:28.040
you're facing challenging problems,

08:28.040 --> 08:30.120
but they're not made any worse

08:30.120 --> 08:32.560
by uncertainty about sub-nuclear physics.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.640
And at every level,

08:35.640 --> 08:38.040
just because you understand the rules of the game

08:38.040 --> 08:40.440
or have some understanding of the rules of the game

08:40.440 --> 08:45.320
doesn't mean you know what kind of beautiful things

08:45.320 --> 08:46.800
that game creates.

08:46.800 --> 08:51.800
Right, so if you're interested in birds and how they fly,

08:52.480 --> 08:57.320
then things like imprinting the baby on the mother

08:57.320 --> 09:00.080
and all that and things like that

09:00.480 --> 09:02.960
are what you need to understand.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.040
You couldn't even in principle solve this vertical equation

09:07.040 --> 09:09.720
how an albatross wanders for thousands of miles

09:09.720 --> 09:11.400
of the Southern Ocean and comes back

09:11.400 --> 09:13.920
and then coughs up food for its young.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.600
That's something we can understand in a sense

09:16.600 --> 09:18.600
and predict the behavior,

09:18.600 --> 09:22.440
but it's not because we can solve it on the atomic scale.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.560
You mentioned that there might be

09:23.560 --> 09:26.720
some fundamental limitation to the human brain

09:26.720 --> 09:30.680
that limits our ability to understand some aspect

09:30.680 --> 09:31.760
of how the universe works.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.560
That's really interesting.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.920
That's sad, actually.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.800
If to the degree it's true, it's sad.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.040
So what do you mean by that?

09:40.040 --> 09:43.280
I would simply say that just as a monkey

09:43.280 --> 09:47.400
can't understand quantum theory or even Newtonian physics,

09:47.400 --> 09:50.480
there's no particular reason why the human brain

09:50.480 --> 09:52.640
should evolve to be well-matched

09:52.640 --> 09:55.520
to understanding a deepest aspect of reality.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.640
And I suspect that there may be aspects

09:58.640 --> 10:00.960
that we are not even aware of

10:00.960 --> 10:03.480
and couldn't really fully comprehend.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.920
But as an intermediate step towards that,

10:05.920 --> 10:08.480
one thing which I think is a very interesting possibility

10:08.480 --> 10:11.320
is the extent to which AI can help us.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.800
I mean, I think if you take the example

10:13.800 --> 10:16.160
of so-called theories of everything,

10:16.160 --> 10:18.640
one of which is string theory,

10:18.640 --> 10:23.040
string theory involves very complicated geometry

10:23.080 --> 10:25.880
and structures in 10 dimensions.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.760
And it's certainly, in my view, on the cards

10:29.760 --> 10:34.760
that the physics of 10 dimensions,

10:36.400 --> 10:38.040
very complicated geometry,

10:38.920 --> 10:42.560
may be too hard for a human being to work through

10:42.560 --> 10:46.480
but could be worked through by an AI

10:47.600 --> 10:50.920
with the advantage of the huge processing power

10:50.920 --> 10:53.560
which enables them to learn world championship chess

10:53.560 --> 10:55.760
within a few hours just by watching games.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.320
So there's every reason to expect

10:58.320 --> 11:02.960
that these machines could help us to solve these problems.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.600
And of course, if that's the way we came to understand

11:06.600 --> 11:08.440
where the string theory was right,

11:08.440 --> 11:09.920
it should be in a sense frustrating

11:09.920 --> 11:13.360
because you wouldn't get the sort of aha insight,

11:13.360 --> 11:15.840
which is the greatest satisfaction from doing science.

11:15.840 --> 11:20.320
But on the other hand, if a machine churns away

11:20.400 --> 11:22.000
10 dimensional geometry,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.480
figuring out all the possible origamis

11:25.480 --> 11:27.640
bound up in extra dimensions,

11:27.640 --> 11:30.040
if it comes out at the end,

11:30.040 --> 11:32.600
spews out the correct mass of the electron,

11:32.600 --> 11:34.600
the fact that there are three kinds of neutrinos,

11:34.600 --> 11:35.680
something like that,

11:35.680 --> 11:38.240
you would know that there was some truth in the theory.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.280
And so we may have a theory which we come to trust

11:41.280 --> 11:45.640
because it does predict things that we can observe and check,

11:45.640 --> 11:49.360
but we may never really understand the full workings of it

11:49.400 --> 11:53.040
to the extent that we do more or less understand

11:53.040 --> 11:58.040
how most phenomena can be explained in a fundamental way.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.720
Of course, in the case of quantum theory,

11:59.720 --> 12:01.280
many people would say,

12:01.280 --> 12:02.880
understandably there's still some mystery

12:02.880 --> 12:04.920
if you don't quite understand why it works,

12:04.920 --> 12:06.600
but there could be deeper mysteries

12:06.600 --> 12:08.520
when we get to these unified theories,

12:08.520 --> 12:10.440
where there's a big gap between

12:10.440 --> 12:14.240
what a computer can print out for us at the end

12:14.240 --> 12:18.080
and what we can actually grasp and think through in our heads.

12:18.080 --> 12:20.080
Yeah, it's interesting that the idea

12:20.080 --> 12:22.200
that there could be things a computer could tell us

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
that is true,

12:24.120 --> 12:26.960
and maybe it can even help us understand

12:26.960 --> 12:29.240
why it's true a little bit,

12:29.240 --> 12:31.520
but ultimately it's still a long journey

12:31.520 --> 12:34.760
to really deeply understand the whys of it.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.360
Yes, and that's the limitation of our brain.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.960
We can try to sneak up to it in different ways

12:40.960 --> 12:42.720
given the limitations of our brain.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.880
Have you, I've gotten a chance to spend the day at DeepMind,

12:45.880 --> 12:47.520
talk to Demis Hassabis.

12:47.520 --> 12:52.520
His big dream is to apply AI to the questions of science,

12:52.520 --> 12:54.360
certainly to the questions of physics.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.000
Have you gotten a chance to interact with him?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.480
Well, I know him quite well.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.440
He's one of my heroes, certainly.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.280
And I remember-

13:01.280 --> 13:02.120
I'm sure he would say the same.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.680
And I remember the first time I met him,

13:04.680 --> 13:06.400
he said that he was like me,

13:06.400 --> 13:08.560
he wants to understand the universe,

13:08.560 --> 13:10.240
but he thought the best thing to do

13:10.240 --> 13:12.120
was to try and develop AI,

13:12.120 --> 13:13.400
and then with the help of AI,

13:13.400 --> 13:15.720
he'd stand more chance of understanding the universe.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.080
He's right about that.

13:18.080 --> 13:22.360
And of course, although we're familiar

13:22.360 --> 13:27.040
with the way his computers play Go and chess,

13:27.840 --> 13:29.920
he's already made contributions to science

13:29.920 --> 13:32.880
through understanding protein folding

13:32.880 --> 13:34.960
better than the best human chemists.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.840
And so already he's on the path to showing ways

13:38.840 --> 13:43.160
in which computers have the power to learn and do things

13:43.160 --> 13:45.480
by having a bit to analyze enormous samples

13:46.320 --> 13:48.640
in a short time to do better than humans.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.880
And so I think he would resonate with what I've just said,

13:51.880 --> 13:55.520
that it may be that in these other fundamental questions,

13:55.520 --> 13:58.320
the computers will play a crucial role.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.880
Yeah, and they're also doing

13:59.880 --> 14:02.320
quantum mechanical simulation of electrons.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.360
They're doing control of high temperature

14:06.360 --> 14:08.000
plasma fusion reactors.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.680
Yes, that's a new thing, which is very interesting.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.640
They can suppress the instabilities in these tokamaks

14:13.640 --> 14:15.120
better than any other way.

14:15.960 --> 14:19.520
The march of progress by AIs in science

14:21.720 --> 14:24.280
is making big strides.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.280
Do you think an AI system will win a Nobel Prize

14:27.280 --> 14:28.520
in the century?

14:28.520 --> 14:29.360
What do you think?

14:31.760 --> 14:33.640
Does that make you sad?

14:33.640 --> 14:37.000
If I can digress and put in a plug for my next book,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.480
it has a chapter saying why Nobel Prizes

14:39.480 --> 14:40.760
do more harm than good.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.600
On quite separate subjects.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.240
I think Nobel Prizes do a great deal of damage

14:46.240 --> 14:49.280
to the perception of the way science is done.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.160
Of course, if you ask who or what deserves the credits

14:52.160 --> 14:54.000
for any scientific discovery,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.440
it may be often someone who has an idea,

14:56.440 --> 14:59.760
a team of people who work a big experiment, et cetera.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.760
And of course, it's the quality of the equipment,

15:03.760 --> 15:05.960
which is crucial.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.480
And certainly in the subjects I do in astronomy,

15:09.480 --> 15:12.640
the huge advances we've had

15:13.320 --> 15:16.560
not from us being more intelligent than Aristotle was,

15:16.560 --> 15:19.720
but through us having far, far better data

15:20.680 --> 15:23.280
from powerful telescopes on the ground and in space.

15:23.280 --> 15:27.720
And also incidentally, we've benefited hugely in astronomy

15:27.720 --> 15:30.000
from computer simulations,

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
because if you are a subatomic physicist,

15:35.240 --> 15:37.920
then of course you crash together the particles

15:37.920 --> 15:40.520
in a big accelerator like the one at CERN

15:40.520 --> 15:42.000
and see what happens.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.440
But I can't crash together two galaxies or two stars

15:46.440 --> 15:47.760
and see what happens.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.480
But in the virtual world of a computer,

15:50.480 --> 15:53.800
one can do simulations like that.

15:53.800 --> 15:58.080
And the power of computers is such that these simulations

15:58.080 --> 16:02.520
can yield a phenomena and insights

16:02.520 --> 16:05.160
which we wouldn't have guessed beforehand.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.520
And the way we can feel by making progress

16:08.520 --> 16:10.800
and trying to understand some of these phenomena,

16:10.800 --> 16:13.560
why galaxies have the size and shape they do and all that

16:13.560 --> 16:15.680
is because we can do simulations

16:16.640 --> 16:18.880
tweaking different initial conditions

16:18.880 --> 16:21.360
and seeing which gives the best fit

16:21.360 --> 16:22.840
to what we actually observe.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.080
And so that's a way in which we've made progress

16:26.080 --> 16:28.120
in using computers.

16:28.120 --> 16:32.120
And incidentally, we also now need to analyze data

16:32.120 --> 16:33.760
because one thinks of astronomy

16:33.760 --> 16:36.280
as being traditionally a rather data poor subjects,

16:36.280 --> 16:39.320
but the European satellite called Gaia

16:39.360 --> 16:44.040
has just put online the speeds and colors

16:44.040 --> 16:46.800
and properties of nearly two billion stars

16:46.800 --> 16:48.200
in the Milky Way.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.800
And we can do fantastic analysis of,

16:50.800 --> 16:52.720
and that of course could not be done at all

16:52.720 --> 16:55.720
without just the number of crunching capacities computers.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.720
And the new methods of machine learning

16:57.720 --> 17:00.720
actually love raw data,

17:00.720 --> 17:02.960
the kind that astronomy provides,

17:02.960 --> 17:05.160
organized structured raw data.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.840
Well, indeed, because the reason they really

17:06.840 --> 17:08.400
haven't benefited over us

17:08.400 --> 17:11.720
is that they can learn and think so much faster.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.080
That's how they can learn to play chess and go.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.600
That's how they can learn to diagnose lung cancer

17:17.600 --> 17:19.320
better than the radiologist

17:19.320 --> 17:21.600
and because they can look at a hundred thousand scans

17:21.600 --> 17:23.480
in a few days,

17:23.480 --> 17:28.400
whereas no human radiologist sees that many a lifetime.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.400
Well, there's still a magic to the human intelligence,

17:32.400 --> 17:34.840
to the intuition, to the common sense reasoning.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.400
Well, we hope so.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.240
For now.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.600
What is the new book that you mentioned?

17:40.600 --> 17:41.440
The book I mentioned,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.720
it's called If Science Is To Save Us.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.440
It's coming out in September.

17:45.440 --> 17:50.440
And it's on the big challenges of science,

17:52.640 --> 17:57.640
climate, dealing with biosafety and dealing with cyber safety.

17:57.920 --> 18:02.920
And also it's got chapters on the way science is organized

18:03.160 --> 18:05.120
in universities and academies, et cetera.

18:05.120 --> 18:05.960
Institution of science.

18:05.960 --> 18:10.280
The ethics of science and the education.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.120
And perhaps the limits of science.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.520
And the limits, yes.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.800
Well, let me actually just stroll around the beautiful

18:16.800 --> 18:19.120
and the strange of the universe.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.520
Over 20 years ago, you hypothesized

18:21.520 --> 18:25.920
that we would solve the mystery of dark matter by now.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.360
So unfortunately we didn't quite yet.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.840
First, what is dark matter

18:31.840 --> 18:35.280
and why has it been so tough to figure out?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.000
Well, I mean, we learned that galaxies

18:38.000 --> 18:42.160
and other large scale structures which are moving around,

18:42.160 --> 18:46.680
but prevention flying apart by gravity

18:47.640 --> 18:52.640
would be flying apart if they only contain the stuff we see,

18:53.080 --> 18:55.200
if everything in them was shining.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.800
And to understand how galaxies formed

18:58.800 --> 19:03.640
and why they do remain confined to same size,

19:03.640 --> 19:06.520
one has to infer that there's about five times

19:06.520 --> 19:10.400
as much stuff producing gravitational forces

19:10.400 --> 19:12.640
than the total amount of stuff

19:12.640 --> 19:14.680
in the gas and stars that we see.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.600
And that stuff is called dark matter.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.160
That's the leading name.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.800
It's not dark, it's just transparent, et cetera.

19:21.800 --> 19:26.080
And the most likely interpretation

19:26.080 --> 19:31.080
is that it's a swarm of microscopic particles

19:31.080 --> 19:33.280
which have no electric charge.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.960
And the very small cross-sections

19:34.960 --> 19:37.320
were hitting each other and hitting anything else.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.880
So they swarm around

19:38.880 --> 19:41.480
and we can detect their collective effects.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.720
And when we do computer simulations

19:43.720 --> 19:46.200
of how galaxies form and evolve

19:46.200 --> 19:48.360
and how they emerge from the Big Bang,

19:48.360 --> 19:51.880
then we get a nice consistent picture

19:51.880 --> 19:56.320
if we put in five times as much mass

19:56.320 --> 20:00.560
in the form of these mysterious dark particles.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.720
And for instance, it works better

20:02.880 --> 20:04.680
if you think they're non-interacting particles

20:04.680 --> 20:05.840
than if you think they're a gas

20:05.840 --> 20:07.160
which would have shock waves and things.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.760
So we know something about the properties of these,

20:09.760 --> 20:11.160
but we don't know what they are.

20:11.160 --> 20:16.160
And the disappointment compared to my guess 20 years ago

20:16.160 --> 20:19.200
is that particles answering this description

20:19.200 --> 20:20.320
have not yet been found.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.640
It was thought that the big accelerator,

20:22.640 --> 20:24.880
the Large Hadron Collider at CERN,

20:24.880 --> 20:26.160
which is the world's biggest,

20:26.160 --> 20:28.680
might have found a new class of particles

20:28.680 --> 20:30.800
which would have been the obvious candidates.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.040
And it hasn't.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.960
And some people say,

20:34.960 --> 20:37.240
well, dark matter can't be there, et cetera.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.920
But what I would argue is that

20:38.920 --> 20:41.520
there's a huge amount of parameter space

20:41.520 --> 20:44.200
that hasn't been explored.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.440
There are other kinds of particles called axions

20:46.440 --> 20:48.160
which behave slightly differently,

20:48.160 --> 20:49.800
which are good candidates.

20:49.800 --> 20:54.360
And there's a factor of 10 powers of 10

20:54.360 --> 20:56.440
between the heaviest particles

20:56.440 --> 21:01.000
that could be created by the Large Hadron Collider

21:01.000 --> 21:02.320
and the heaviest particles,

21:02.320 --> 21:04.800
which on theoretical grounds could exist

21:04.800 --> 21:06.400
without turning into black holes.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.520
So there's a huge amount of possible particles

21:09.520 --> 21:13.240
which could be out there as remnants of the Big Bang

21:13.240 --> 21:15.280
but which we wouldn't be able to detect so easily.

21:15.280 --> 21:18.400
So the fact that we've got new constraints

21:18.400 --> 21:20.640
on what the dark matter could be

21:20.640 --> 21:23.520
doesn't diminish my belief that it's there

21:23.520 --> 21:24.520
in the form of particles

21:24.520 --> 21:26.760
because we've only explored a small fraction

21:26.760 --> 21:28.480
of parameter space.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.840
So there's this search.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.960
You're literally, upon an unintended,

21:33.960 --> 21:36.960
are searching in the dark here

21:36.960 --> 21:39.720
in this giant parameter space of possible particles.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.480
You're searching for, I mean,

21:41.480 --> 21:43.760
there could be all kinds of particles.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.520
There could be, and there's some

21:45.520 --> 21:47.240
which may be very, very hard to detect.

21:47.240 --> 21:51.480
But I think we can hope for some new theoretical ideas

21:51.480 --> 21:55.480
because one point which perhaps you'd like to discuss more

21:55.480 --> 21:58.680
is about the very early stage of the Big Bang.

21:58.680 --> 22:03.080
And the situation now is that we have an outlined picture

22:03.080 --> 22:05.440
for how the universe has evolved

22:05.440 --> 22:09.520
from the time when it was expanding in just a nanosecond

22:10.560 --> 22:12.200
right up to the present.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.520
And we could do that because after nanosecond,

22:16.520 --> 22:20.240
the physics of the material is in the same range

22:20.240 --> 22:21.600
that we can test in the lab.

22:22.600 --> 22:26.000
After a nanosecond, the particles move around

22:26.000 --> 22:28.040
like those in the Large Hadron Collider.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.760
If you wait for one second,

22:29.760 --> 22:32.920
they're rather like in the centers of the hottest stars

22:32.920 --> 22:36.280
and nuclear reactions produce hydrogen, helium, et cetera,

22:36.280 --> 22:37.160
which fit the data.

22:37.160 --> 22:40.160
So we can, with confidence, extrapolate back

22:40.160 --> 22:42.000
to when the universe was a nanosecond old.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.760
Indeed, I think we can do it with as much confidence

22:44.760 --> 22:46.320
as anything a geologist tells you

22:46.320 --> 22:47.880
about the early history of the Earth.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.080
And that's huge progress in the last 50 years.

22:50.120 --> 22:55.120
But any progress puts in sharper focus new mysteries.

22:56.200 --> 23:00.000
And of course, the new mysteries in this context

23:00.000 --> 23:02.960
are why is the universe expanding the way it is?

23:02.960 --> 23:06.400
Why does it contain this mixture of atoms

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
and dark matter and radiation?

23:08.400 --> 23:11.160
And why does it have the properties

23:11.160 --> 23:12.960
which allow galaxies to form,

23:12.960 --> 23:15.200
being fairly smooth but not completely smooth?

23:15.200 --> 23:17.640
And the answer to those questions

23:17.680 --> 23:19.680
are generally believed to lie

23:19.680 --> 23:22.720
in a much, much earlier stage of the universe

23:22.720 --> 23:25.200
when conditions were much more extreme

23:25.200 --> 23:27.920
and therefore far beyond the stage

23:27.920 --> 23:30.640
where we had the foothold in experiments, very theoretical.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.880
And so we don't have a convincing theory.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.360
We just have ideas until we have something like string theory

23:37.360 --> 23:40.720
or some other clues to the ultra-early universe.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.840
That's going to remain speculative.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.600
So there's a big gap.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.200
And to say how big the gap is,

23:47.200 --> 23:49.320
if we take the observable universe

23:49.320 --> 23:52.960
out to a bit more than 10 billion light years,

23:52.960 --> 23:55.920
then when the universe was a nanosecond old,

23:56.800 --> 24:00.320
that was being squeezed down to the size of our solar system

24:00.320 --> 24:03.120
or compressed into that volume.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.880
But the times we're talking about

24:05.880 --> 24:09.840
when the key properties of the universe were first imprinted

24:09.840 --> 24:13.320
were times when that entire universe was squeezed down

24:13.320 --> 24:16.000
to the size of a tennis ball or baseball,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.960
if you prefer, and to emerge from something microscopic.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.720
So it's a huge extrapolation.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.960
And it's not surprising that since it's so far

24:24.960 --> 24:28.680
from our experimental range of detectability,

24:28.680 --> 24:31.600
we are still groping for ideas.

24:31.600 --> 24:36.320
But you think first theory will reach into that place

24:36.320 --> 24:39.840
and then experiment will perhaps one day catch up.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.440
Well, I think in a sense it's a combination.

24:42.440 --> 24:47.440
I think what we hope for is that there'll be a theory

24:48.520 --> 24:51.600
which applies to the early universe,

24:51.600 --> 24:53.920
but which also has consequences

24:53.920 --> 24:56.760
which we can test in our present day universe,

24:57.640 --> 25:02.640
like discovering why neutrinos exist or things like that.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.360
And that's the thing which, as I mentioned,

25:05.360 --> 25:09.000
we may perhaps need a bit of AI to help us to calculate.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.920
But I think the hope would be

25:11.920 --> 25:15.520
that we will have a theory which applies

25:15.520 --> 25:18.240
under the very, very extreme early stages of the universe,

25:18.240 --> 25:20.960
but which gains credibility and gains confidence

25:20.960 --> 25:23.080
because it also manages to account

25:23.080 --> 25:27.160
for otherwise unexplained features of the low-energy world

25:27.160 --> 25:30.160
and what people call the standard model of particle physics,

25:30.160 --> 25:32.560
where there are lots of undetermined numbers.

25:32.560 --> 25:35.200
So it may help with that.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.520
So we're dancing between physics and philosophy a little bit,

25:38.520 --> 25:43.520
but what do you think happened before the Big Bang?

25:44.360 --> 25:46.480
So this seems, this feels like something

25:46.480 --> 25:48.480
that's out of the reach of science.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.280
It's out of the reach of present science

25:50.280 --> 25:54.800
because science develops and as the front is advanced,

25:54.800 --> 25:56.720
then new problems come into focus

25:56.720 --> 25:58.400
that couldn't even have been postulated before.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.400
I mean, if I think of my own career,

26:00.400 --> 26:04.800
when I was a student, the evidence for the Big Bang

26:04.800 --> 26:08.400
was pretty weak, whereas now it's extremely strong.

26:09.240 --> 26:12.640
But we are now thinking about the reason

26:12.640 --> 26:15.080
why the universe is the way it is and all that.

26:15.080 --> 26:20.000
So I would put all these things we've just mentioned

26:20.000 --> 26:22.200
in the category of speculative science.

26:23.240 --> 26:26.840
And I don't see a bifurcation between that and philosophy.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.880
But of course, to answer your question,

26:30.240 --> 26:33.080
if we do want to understand the very early universe,

26:33.080 --> 26:35.840
then we've got to realize that it may involve

26:35.840 --> 26:39.800
counterintuitive concepts than quantum theory does,

26:39.800 --> 26:42.560
because it's a condition even further away

26:42.560 --> 26:46.240
from everyday world than quantum theory is.

26:46.240 --> 26:50.800
And remember our lives, our brains evolved

26:50.800 --> 26:53.440
and haven't changed much since our ancestors

26:53.440 --> 26:57.400
roamed the African savanna and looked at the everyday world.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.520
And it's rather amazing that we've been able

26:59.520 --> 27:01.880
to make some sense of the quantum micro world

27:01.880 --> 27:05.000
and of the cosmos, but there may be some things

27:05.040 --> 27:07.520
which are beyond us and certainly, as we implied,

27:07.520 --> 27:10.560
there are things that we don't yet understand at all.

27:10.560 --> 27:14.360
And of course, one concept we might have to jettison

27:14.360 --> 27:17.240
is the idea of three dimensions of space

27:17.240 --> 27:19.080
and time just ticking away.

27:20.080 --> 27:20.960
There are lots of ideas.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.280
I mean, I think Stephen Hawking had an idea

27:24.280 --> 27:28.880
that talking about what hasn't before the Big Bang,

27:28.880 --> 27:30.960
it's like asking what happens if you go north

27:30.960 --> 27:33.880
from the North Pole, you know, it somehow closes off.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.800
That's just one idea.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.520
I don't like that idea, but that's a possible one.

27:38.520 --> 27:43.520
And so we just don't know what happened

27:43.680 --> 27:45.640
at the very beginning of the Big Bang,

27:45.640 --> 27:48.840
were there many Big Bangs rather than one, et cetera.

27:48.840 --> 27:53.200
And those are issues which we may be able

27:53.200 --> 27:58.200
to get some foothold on from some new theory.

27:58.200 --> 28:03.200
Theory, but even then, we won't be able

28:03.560 --> 28:05.280
to directly test the theories.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.840
But I think it's a heresy to think you have to be able

28:08.840 --> 28:11.480
to test every prediction of a theory.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.160
Let me give you another example.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.080
We take seriously what Einstein's theory says

28:17.080 --> 28:19.600
about the inside of black holes,

28:19.600 --> 28:21.200
even though we can't observe them,

28:21.200 --> 28:23.880
because that theory has been vindicated

28:23.880 --> 28:27.720
in many other places in cosmology and black holes,

28:27.720 --> 28:30.120
gravitational waves and all those things.

28:30.120 --> 28:35.120
Likewise, if we had a theory which explains some things

28:35.560 --> 28:37.040
about the early history of our Big Bang

28:37.040 --> 28:38.640
in the present universe,

28:38.640 --> 28:43.320
then we would take seriously the inference

28:43.320 --> 28:45.440
if it predicted many Big Bangs, not one,

28:45.440 --> 28:47.480
even though we can't predict the other ones.

28:47.480 --> 28:52.440
So the example is we can take seriously a prediction

28:52.440 --> 28:53.840
if it's the consequence of a theory

28:53.840 --> 28:56.280
that we believe on other grounds.

28:56.320 --> 29:00.200
We don't need to be able to detect another Big Bang

29:00.200 --> 29:01.840
in order to take it seriously.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.520
It may not be a proof, but it's a good indication

29:05.520 --> 29:10.000
that this is the direction where the truth lies.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.360
Yeah, if the theory has gained confidence in other ways.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.560
Where do you sense?

29:14.560 --> 29:18.160
Do you think there's other universes besides our own?

29:19.120 --> 29:20.800
There are sort of well-defined theories

29:20.800 --> 29:24.400
which make assumptions about the physics

29:24.400 --> 29:25.240
at the relevant time.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.920
And this time, incidentally,

29:26.920 --> 29:31.440
is 10 to the power minus 36 seconds or earlier than that.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.960
So this tiny sliver of time.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.640
And there were some theories,

29:36.640 --> 29:39.120
famous one due to Andre Linde,

29:39.120 --> 29:42.280
the Russian cosmologist now at Stanford

29:42.280 --> 29:43.800
called eternal inflation,

29:44.680 --> 29:47.880
which did predict an eternal production

29:47.880 --> 29:49.760
of new Big Bangs as it were.

29:49.760 --> 29:54.560
And that's based on specific assumptions about the physics,

29:54.560 --> 29:55.800
but those assumptions, of course,

29:55.800 --> 29:58.640
are just hypotheses which aren't vindicated.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.480
But there are other theories

30:00.480 --> 30:02.640
which only predict one Big Bang.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.680
So I think we should be open-minded

30:05.680 --> 30:08.640
and not dogmatic about these options

30:08.640 --> 30:10.840
until we do understand the relevant physics.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.720
But there are these different scenarios

30:13.720 --> 30:16.400
of very different ideas about this.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.840
But I think all of them have the feature

30:19.840 --> 30:23.000
that physical reality is a lot more extensive

30:23.000 --> 30:24.680
than what we can see through our telescope.

30:24.680 --> 30:27.680
I think even most conservative astronomers would say that

30:27.680 --> 30:31.080
because we can see out with our telescopes

30:31.080 --> 30:33.120
to a sort of horizon,

30:33.120 --> 30:36.560
which is about depending on how you measure it,

30:36.560 --> 30:38.960
it's about maybe 15 billion light years away

30:38.960 --> 30:40.240
or something like that.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.480
But that horizon of observations

30:43.480 --> 30:45.720
is no more physical reality

30:45.720 --> 30:48.640
than the horizon around you if you're in the ocean.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.760
And looking out at your horizon,

30:53.440 --> 30:54.960
there's no reason to think that the ocean ends

30:54.960 --> 30:56.520
just beyond your horizon.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.760
And likewise, there's no reason to think

30:58.760 --> 31:02.120
that the aftermath of our Big Bang

31:02.120 --> 31:05.400
ends just at the boundary of what we can see.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.840
Indeed, there are quite strong arguments

31:07.840 --> 31:11.000
that it probably goes on about 100 times further.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.360
It may even go on so much further

31:13.360 --> 31:16.800
that all combinatorials are replicated.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.280
And there's another set of people like us

31:19.280 --> 31:20.880
sitting in a room like this.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.440
Every possible combination of...

31:22.440 --> 31:24.200
Yeah, that could happen.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.360
That's not logically impossible.

31:27.360 --> 31:31.560
But I think many people would accept that it does go on

31:31.560 --> 31:36.120
and contain probably a million times as much stuff

31:36.120 --> 31:38.720
as what we can see within our horizon.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.320
The reason for that, incidentally,

31:40.320 --> 31:42.960
is that if we look as far as we can in one direction

31:42.960 --> 31:45.120
and in the opposite direction,

31:45.120 --> 31:47.000
then the conditions don't differ

31:47.000 --> 31:49.240
by more than one part in 100,000.

31:49.240 --> 31:53.040
So that means that if we're part of some finite structure,

31:53.040 --> 31:56.200
the gradient across the part we can see is very small.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.440
And so that suggests that it probably does go on

31:58.440 --> 32:01.400
a lot further, and the best estimates say

32:01.400 --> 32:04.160
it must go on at least 20 times further.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.640
Is that exciting or terrifying to you,

32:07.640 --> 32:11.640
just the spans of it all, the wide,

32:11.640 --> 32:14.040
everything that lies beyond the horizon?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.280
That example doesn't even hold for Earth,

32:17.280 --> 32:19.080
so it goes way, way farther.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.640
And on top of that, just to take your metaphor further

32:22.640 --> 32:26.640
on the ocean, while we're on top of this ocean,

32:26.640 --> 32:29.400
not only can we not see beyond the horizon,

32:29.400 --> 32:32.640
we also don't know much about the depth of the ocean,

32:33.720 --> 32:37.520
nor the actual mechanism of observation that's in our head.

32:38.800 --> 32:39.960
No, I think there was an algebra

32:39.960 --> 32:42.560
for all those points you make, yes, yes.

32:42.560 --> 32:47.560
But I think even the solar system is pretty vast

32:47.560 --> 32:49.200
by human standards.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.880
And so I don't think the perception

32:52.880 --> 32:57.880
of this utterly vast cosmos need have any deeper impact

32:59.480 --> 33:02.480
on us than just realizing that we are very small

33:02.480 --> 33:04.320
on the scale of the external world.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.160
Yeah, it's humbling, though.

33:08.160 --> 33:12.560
It's humbling, and depending where your ego is,

33:12.560 --> 33:13.480
it's humbling.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.800
Well, if you start off very un-humble indeed,

33:15.800 --> 33:16.760
it may make a difference.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.920
But most of us, I don't think it makes much difference.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.880
And well, there's a more general question, of course,

33:22.880 --> 33:27.880
about whether the human race as such

33:28.160 --> 33:32.240
is something which is very special,

33:32.240 --> 33:37.240
or if on the other hand, it's just one of many such

33:38.360 --> 33:40.840
species elsewhere in the universe,

33:40.840 --> 33:43.440
or indeed existing at different times in our universe.

33:44.280 --> 33:48.360
To me, it feels almost obvious

33:48.360 --> 33:51.520
that the universe should be full of alien life,

33:51.520 --> 33:53.840
perhaps dead alien civilizations,

33:53.840 --> 33:58.120
but just the vastness of space.

33:58.120 --> 34:02.960
And it just feels wrong to think of Earth

34:02.960 --> 34:04.160
as somehow special.

34:04.160 --> 34:07.040
It sure as heck doesn't look that special.

34:07.040 --> 34:10.120
The more we learn, the less special it seems.

34:10.200 --> 34:12.320
Well, I mean, I don't agree with that

34:12.320 --> 34:14.280
as far as life is concerned,

34:14.280 --> 34:17.640
because remember that we don't understand

34:17.640 --> 34:19.560
how life began here on Earth.

34:19.560 --> 34:22.120
We don't understand, although we know

34:22.120 --> 34:24.680
that we need evolution of simple life to complex life,

34:24.680 --> 34:28.360
we don't understand what caused the transition

34:28.360 --> 34:33.040
between complex chemistry and the first replicating,

34:33.040 --> 34:35.480
metabolizing entity we call alive.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.000
That's a mystery.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.440
And serious physicists and chemists

34:41.440 --> 34:44.360
are now thinking about it, but we don't know.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.440
So we therefore can't say, was it a rare fluke,

34:48.440 --> 34:51.600
which would not have happened anywhere else,

34:51.600 --> 34:54.800
or was it something which involves a process

34:54.800 --> 34:57.800
that would have happened in any other planet

34:57.800 --> 35:00.760
where conditions were like they were on the young Earth?

35:00.760 --> 35:03.760
So we can't say that now.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.840
I think many of us would indeed bet

35:07.680 --> 35:10.320
that probably some kind of life exists elsewhere.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.640
But even if you accept that,

35:12.640 --> 35:16.080
then there are many contingencies going from simple life

35:16.080 --> 35:18.480
to present day life,

35:18.480 --> 35:22.520
and some biologists like Stephen Jay Gould

35:22.520 --> 35:24.960
thought that if you rerun evolution,

35:24.960 --> 35:26.920
you'd end up with something quite different,

35:26.920 --> 35:28.480
and maybe not with an intelligent species.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.440
So the contingencies in evolution

35:31.440 --> 35:35.560
may militate against the emergence of intelligence,

35:35.560 --> 35:38.280
even if life gets started in lots of places.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.440
So I think these are still completely open questions.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.120
And that's why it's such an exciting time now

35:43.120 --> 35:45.040
that we are starting to be able to address these.

35:45.040 --> 35:49.080
I mean, I mentioned the fact that the origin of life

35:49.080 --> 35:52.840
is a question that we may be able to understand,

35:52.840 --> 35:54.480
and serious people are working on it.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.560
It's usually put in the sort of too difficult box.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.000
Everyone knew it was important,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.240
but they didn't know how to tackle it

35:59.240 --> 36:00.400
or what experiments to do.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.160
But it's not like that now.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.280
And that's partly because of cleverer experiments,

36:05.320 --> 36:07.040
but I think most importantly,

36:07.040 --> 36:10.840
because we are aware that we can look for life

36:10.840 --> 36:14.360
in other places, other places in our solar system,

36:14.360 --> 36:18.040
and of course, on the exoplanets around other stars.

36:18.040 --> 36:22.840
And within 10 or 20 years, I think two things could happen,

36:22.840 --> 36:25.000
which will be really, really important.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.800
We might, with the next big telescope,

36:28.800 --> 36:32.080
be able to image some of the Earth-like planets

36:32.080 --> 36:34.120
around other stars.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.240
Image, like get a picture.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.600
Well, actually, let me caveat that.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.840
It'd take 50 years to get a resolved image,

36:41.840 --> 36:43.680
but to actually detect the light.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.760
Because now, of course, these exoplanets are detected

36:46.760 --> 36:49.120
by their effects on the parent star.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.200
They either cause their parent star to dim slightly

36:52.200 --> 36:54.640
when they transit across in front of it,

36:54.640 --> 36:55.920
and so we see the dips,

36:55.920 --> 37:00.280
or their gravitational pull makes the star wobble a bit.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.120
So most of the 5,000-plus planets

37:03.120 --> 37:05.440
that have been found around other stars,

37:05.440 --> 37:08.160
they've been found indirectly by their effect

37:08.160 --> 37:10.000
in one of those two ways on the parent star.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.840
You could still do a pretty good job

37:10.840 --> 37:14.280
of estimating size, all those kinds of things.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.520
The size and the mass, you can estimate.

37:16.520 --> 37:20.960
But detecting the actual light

37:20.960 --> 37:24.480
from one of these exoplanets hasn't really been done yet,

37:24.480 --> 37:27.840
except for one or two very bright, big planets.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.760
So maybe like James Webb Telescope would be.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.720
James Webb may do this,

37:31.720 --> 37:36.160
but even better will be the European ground-based telescope

37:36.160 --> 37:38.840
called Unimaginatively Extremely Large Telescope,

37:38.840 --> 37:41.720
which has a 39-meter diameter mirror.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.800
39 meters, a mosaic of 800 sheets of glass,

37:44.800 --> 37:48.400
and that will collect enough light

37:48.400 --> 37:53.280
from one of these exoplanets around a nearby star

37:53.280 --> 37:56.720
to be able to separate out its light

37:56.760 --> 37:59.960
from that of the star, which is millions of times brighter,

37:59.960 --> 38:02.200
and get the spectrum of the planet

38:02.200 --> 38:06.440
and see if it's got oxygen or chlorophyll and things in it.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.280
So that will come.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.800
James Webb may make some steps there,

38:11.800 --> 38:16.200
but I think we can look forward to learning quite a bit

38:16.200 --> 38:19.040
in the next 20 years, because I like to say,

38:19.040 --> 38:22.880
supposing that aliens are looking at the solar system,

38:22.880 --> 38:24.920
then they'd see the sun as an ordinary star,

38:24.920 --> 38:28.800
they'd see the Earth as, in Carl Sager's nice phrase,

38:28.800 --> 38:32.320
a pale blue dot lying very close in the sky

38:32.320 --> 38:35.840
to its star, our sun, and much, much, much fainter.

38:35.840 --> 38:39.160
But if they could observe that dot,

38:39.160 --> 38:40.680
they could learn quite a bit.

38:40.680 --> 38:43.960
They could perhaps get the spectrum of the light

38:43.960 --> 38:45.680
and find the atmosphere.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.280
They'd find the shade of blue was slightly different,

38:48.280 --> 38:50.600
depending on whether the Pacific Ocean

38:50.600 --> 38:52.440
or the land mass of Asia was facing them,

38:52.440 --> 38:54.960
so they could infer the length of the day

38:54.960 --> 38:56.840
and the ocean and continents,

38:56.840 --> 38:59.920
and maybe something about the seasons and the climate.

38:59.920 --> 39:04.920
And that's the kind of calculation and inference

39:06.080 --> 39:08.880
we might be able to draw within the next 10 or 20 years

39:08.880 --> 39:10.760
about other exoplanets,

39:10.760 --> 39:15.760
and evidence of some sort of biosphere on one of them

39:16.160 --> 39:17.560
would, of course, be crucial,

39:17.560 --> 39:21.080
and it would rule out the still logical possibilities

39:21.080 --> 39:22.280
that life is unique.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.840
But there's another way in which this may happen

39:23.840 --> 39:24.840
in the next 20 years.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.520
People think there could be something swimming

39:27.520 --> 39:31.080
under the ice of Europa and Enceladus,

39:31.080 --> 39:34.120
and probes are being sent to maybe not quite go

39:34.120 --> 39:37.080
under the ice, but detect the spray coming out

39:37.080 --> 39:40.160
to see if there's evidence for organics in that.

39:40.160 --> 39:44.920
And if we found any evidence for an origin of life

39:44.920 --> 39:48.400
that had happened in either of those places,

39:48.400 --> 39:49.960
that would immediately be important,

39:49.960 --> 39:53.920
because if life has originated twice,

39:53.920 --> 39:57.720
independently in one planetary system, the solar system,

39:57.720 --> 40:00.320
that would tell us straight away it wasn't a rare accident

40:00.320 --> 40:04.040
and must have happened billions of times in the galaxy.

40:04.040 --> 40:07.080
At the moment, we can't rule out it being unique.

40:07.080 --> 40:09.560
And incidentally, if we found life on Mars,

40:09.560 --> 40:11.680
then that would still be ambiguous,

40:11.680 --> 40:15.080
because people have realized that this early life

40:15.080 --> 40:18.200
could have got from Mars to Earth or vice versa

40:18.200 --> 40:19.040
on meteorites.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.600
So if you found life on Mars, then some skeptics

40:22.600 --> 40:25.760
could still say if it was a single origin.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.600
But I think-

40:26.600 --> 40:27.760
But Europa's far enough-

40:27.760 --> 40:28.600
That's far enough away, yeah.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.440
Statistically because-

40:29.440 --> 40:32.360
Yes, so that's why that would be especially-

40:32.360 --> 40:36.360
It's always the skeptics that ruin a good party, but-

40:37.480 --> 40:38.440
But we need them, of course.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.520
We need them at the party.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.160
We need some skeptics at the party.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.480
But boy, would that be so exciting

40:44.480 --> 40:47.160
to find life on one of the moons.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.880
Because it means that life is everywhere.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.280
That'll just be any kind of vegetation or life.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.440
The question of the aliens or science fiction

40:57.440 --> 40:58.720
is a different matter.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.440
Intelligence aliens.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.640
Yeah, but if you have a good indication

41:03.640 --> 41:07.080
that there's life elsewhere in the solar system,

41:07.080 --> 41:09.840
that means life is everywhere.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.160
I don't know if that's terrifying or what that is,

41:15.160 --> 41:17.240
because if life is everywhere,

41:17.240 --> 41:20.440
why is intelligent life not everywhere?

41:20.440 --> 41:22.000
Why, I mean, you've talked about

41:22.000 --> 41:25.120
that most likely alien civilizations,

41:25.120 --> 41:29.920
if they are out there, they would likely be far ahead of us.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.240
The ones that would actually communicate with us.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.080
Yes.

41:34.080 --> 41:38.480
And that, again, one of those things

41:38.480 --> 41:40.440
that is both exciting and terrifying.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.000
You've mentioned that they're likely

41:42.000 --> 41:44.640
not to be of biological nature.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.000
Well, I think that's important.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.480
Of course, again, it's a speculation,

41:48.480 --> 41:52.880
but in speculating about intelligent life.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.200
And I take the search seriously.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.480
In fact, I chair the committee

41:57.480 --> 42:02.160
that the Russian-American investor Yuri Milner supports

42:02.160 --> 42:04.520
looking for intelligent life.

42:04.520 --> 42:08.000
He's putting $10 million a year into better equipment

42:08.000 --> 42:10.240
and getting time on telescopes to do this.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.200
And so I think it's worthwhile,

42:12.200 --> 42:14.880
even though I don't hold my breath for success.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.160
It's very exciting.

42:16.160 --> 42:21.160
But that does lead me to wonder what might be detected.

42:21.240 --> 42:24.240
And I think, well, we don't know.

42:24.240 --> 42:25.560
We've got to be open minded about anything.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.080
We've no idea what it will be.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.960
And so any anomalous objects,

42:28.960 --> 42:31.840
or even some strange shiny objects in the solar system

42:31.840 --> 42:34.840
or anything we've got to keep our eyes open for.

42:34.840 --> 42:39.840
But I think if we ask what about a planet

42:42.240 --> 42:43.840
like the Earth where evolution

42:43.840 --> 42:45.880
had taken more of the same track,

42:45.880 --> 42:48.280
then as you say, it wouldn't be synchronized.

42:48.280 --> 42:51.080
If it had lagged behind,

42:51.080 --> 42:55.200
then of course it would not have got to advanced life,

42:55.200 --> 42:57.760
but it may have had a head start.

42:57.760 --> 43:01.440
It may have formed on a planet around an older star.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.640
But then let's ask what we would see.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.480
It's taken nearly 4 billion years

43:06.480 --> 43:08.480
from the first life to us.

43:08.480 --> 43:11.760
And we've now got this technological civilization,

43:11.760 --> 43:16.000
which could make itself detectable

43:16.000 --> 43:19.320
to any alien life, aliens out there.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.640
But I think most people would say

43:22.640 --> 43:27.320
that this civilization of flesh and blood creatures

43:27.320 --> 43:28.840
in a collective civilization

43:28.840 --> 43:31.880
may not last more than a few hundred years more.

43:31.880 --> 43:34.240
I think that people may,

43:34.240 --> 43:38.440
some people say it will kill itself off.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.360
But I'm more optimistic.

43:40.360 --> 43:45.160
And I would say that what we're going to have in future

43:45.160 --> 43:49.760
is no longer the slow Darwinian selection,

43:49.760 --> 43:51.480
but we're going to have what I call

43:51.480 --> 43:53.520
secular intelligence design,

43:53.520 --> 43:58.520
which will be humans designing their progeny

44:00.240 --> 44:02.760
to be better adapted to where they are.

44:02.760 --> 44:06.440
And if they go to Mars or somewhere,

44:06.440 --> 44:09.320
they're badly adapted and they want to adapt a lot.

44:09.320 --> 44:11.520
And so they will adapt,

44:12.480 --> 44:13.760
but there may be some limits

44:13.760 --> 44:15.960
to what could be done with flesh and blood.

44:15.960 --> 44:19.520
And so they may become largely electronic,

44:20.960 --> 44:24.080
download their brains and be electronic entities.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.480
And if they're electronic,

44:26.600 --> 44:29.440
then what's important is that they're near immortal.

44:30.760 --> 44:34.280
And also they won't necessarily want to be on a planet

44:34.280 --> 44:35.720
with an atmosphere or gravity.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.000
They may go off into the blue yonder

44:38.600 --> 44:39.680
and if they're near immortal,

44:39.680 --> 44:41.880
they won't be daunted by interstellar travel,

44:41.880 --> 44:43.120
taking a long time.

44:43.120 --> 44:48.120
And so if we looked at what would happen on the earth

44:50.720 --> 44:53.280
in the next millions of years,

44:53.280 --> 44:56.840
then there may be these electronic entities

44:56.840 --> 45:00.960
which have been sent out and are now far away from the earth,

45:00.960 --> 45:05.040
but still sort of burping away in some fashion to be detected.

45:05.320 --> 45:09.080
And so this therefore leads me to think

45:09.080 --> 45:13.120
that if there was another planet

45:13.120 --> 45:15.800
which had evolved like the earth and was ahead of us,

45:17.080 --> 45:18.840
it wouldn't be synchronized

45:18.840 --> 45:20.880
so we wouldn't see a flesh and blood civilization,

45:20.880 --> 45:24.560
but we would see these electronic progeny as it were.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.520
And then this raises another question

45:27.520 --> 45:30.640
because there's the famous argument

45:30.640 --> 45:34.720
against there being lots of aliens out there,

45:34.720 --> 45:37.960
which is that they would come and invade us and eat us

45:37.960 --> 45:41.560
or something like that, you know, that's a common idea,

45:41.560 --> 45:46.360
which Fermi has attributed to, have been the first to say.

45:46.360 --> 45:49.480
And I think there's a escape clause to that

45:49.480 --> 45:54.480
because these entities would be evolved

45:55.360 --> 45:57.320
by second intelligent design,

45:57.320 --> 46:00.920
designed by their predecessors and then designed by us.

46:00.920 --> 46:05.920
And whereas Darwinian selection requires two things,

46:06.680 --> 46:10.560
it requires aggression and intelligence.

46:10.560 --> 46:15.480
This future intelligent design may favor intelligence

46:15.480 --> 46:17.200
because that's what they were designed for,

46:17.200 --> 46:19.520
but it may not favor aggression.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.600
And so these future entities,

46:21.600 --> 46:25.680
they may be sitting deep thoughts, thinking deep thoughts

46:26.840 --> 46:29.800
and not being at all expansionist.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.640
So they could be out there.

46:31.640 --> 46:34.800
And we can't refute their existence

46:34.800 --> 46:36.680
in the way the Fermi paradox

46:36.680 --> 46:38.800
is supposed to refute their existence

46:38.800 --> 46:42.120
because these would not be aggressive or expansionist.

46:42.120 --> 46:45.840
Well, maybe evolution requires competition, not aggression.

46:45.840 --> 46:48.320
And I wonder if competition can take forms

46:48.320 --> 46:50.160
that are non-expansionary.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.760
So you can still have fun competing

46:52.760 --> 46:56.560
in the space of ideas, which may be primarily-

46:56.560 --> 46:58.520
They'd all be philosophers perhaps, yeah.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.080
In a way, right.

47:01.080 --> 47:04.000
It's an intellectual exercise

47:04.000 --> 47:07.880
versus a sort of violent exercise.

47:07.880 --> 47:12.080
So what does this civilization on Mars look like?

47:12.080 --> 47:15.440
So do you think we would more and more,

47:15.440 --> 47:17.840
maybe start with some genetic modification

47:17.840 --> 47:21.360
and then move to basically cyborgs,

47:21.360 --> 47:24.040
increasing integration of electronic systems,

47:24.040 --> 47:26.960
computational systems into our bodies and brains?

47:26.960 --> 47:30.560
This is a theme of my other new book out this year,

47:30.560 --> 47:32.840
which is called The End of Astronauts.

47:32.840 --> 47:33.960
The End of Astronauts.

47:33.960 --> 47:37.680
Co-written with my old friend and colleague

47:37.680 --> 47:40.040
from Berkeley, Don Goldsmith.

47:40.040 --> 47:44.600
And it's really about the role of human space flight

47:44.600 --> 47:47.080
versus sort of robotic space flight.

47:47.080 --> 47:51.280
And just to summarize what it says,

47:51.280 --> 47:54.160
it argues that the practical case

47:54.160 --> 47:56.560
for sending humans into space

47:56.560 --> 47:58.880
is getting weaker all the time

47:58.880 --> 48:01.600
as robots get better and more capable.

48:01.600 --> 48:04.880
Robots 50 years ago couldn't do anything very much,

48:04.880 --> 48:06.920
but now they could assemble big structures

48:06.920 --> 48:10.360
on space or on the moon,

48:10.360 --> 48:13.760
and they could probably do exploration.

48:13.760 --> 48:17.680
Well, present ones on Mars

48:17.680 --> 48:20.280
can't actually do the geology,

48:20.280 --> 48:23.400
but future AI will be able to do the geology

48:23.400 --> 48:26.080
and already they can dig on Mars.

48:26.160 --> 48:29.360
And so if you want to do exploration of Mars,

48:29.360 --> 48:34.160
and of course, even more of Enceladus or Europa,

48:34.160 --> 48:35.560
where you could never send humans,

48:35.560 --> 48:36.760
we depend on robots.

48:37.760 --> 48:38.880
And they're far, far cheaper

48:38.880 --> 48:41.280
because to send a human to Mars

48:41.280 --> 48:45.040
requires feeding them for 200 days on the journey there

48:45.040 --> 48:45.920
and bringing them back.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.160
And neither of those are necessary for robots.

48:48.160 --> 48:52.480
So the practical case for humans is getting very weak.

48:52.480 --> 48:55.880
And if humans go, it's only as an adventure really.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.720
And so the line in our book is that

49:01.480 --> 49:04.560
human space flight should not be pursued

49:04.560 --> 49:08.240
by NASA or public funding agencies

49:08.240 --> 49:12.200
because it has no practical purpose,

49:12.200 --> 49:15.800
but also because it's especially expensive if they do it,

49:15.800 --> 49:19.600
because they would have to be risk averse

49:19.600 --> 49:21.760
in launching civilians into space.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.120
I can illustrate that by noting

49:25.120 --> 49:30.120
that the shuttle was launched 135 times.

49:30.240 --> 49:32.760
And it had two spectacular failures,

49:32.760 --> 49:35.880
which each killed the seven people in the crew.

49:36.800 --> 49:41.800
And it had been mistakenly presented as safe for civilians.

49:42.080 --> 49:43.600
And there was a woman school teacher

49:43.600 --> 49:44.440
killed in one of them.

49:44.440 --> 49:45.960
It was a big national trauma

49:45.960 --> 49:48.560
and they tried to make it safer still.

49:48.560 --> 49:52.880
But if you launch into space,

49:52.880 --> 49:54.760
just the kind of people prepared to accept

49:54.760 --> 49:57.000
that sort of risk and of course test pilots

49:57.000 --> 49:58.840
and people who go hang gliding

49:58.840 --> 50:01.440
and go to the South Pole, et cetera,

50:01.440 --> 50:04.320
are prepared to accept a 2% risk,

50:04.320 --> 50:06.400
at least for a big challenge.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.600
Then of course you do it more cheaply.

50:08.600 --> 50:13.200
And that's why I think human space flight

50:13.200 --> 50:17.960
should be left to the billionaires and their sponsors

50:17.960 --> 50:20.440
because then the taxpayers aren't paying

50:20.440 --> 50:23.360
and they can launch simply those people

50:23.360 --> 50:27.960
who are prepared to accept high risks.

50:27.960 --> 50:30.480
Space adventure, not space tourism.

50:30.480 --> 50:32.960
And we should cheer them on.

50:32.960 --> 50:36.080
And as regards where they would go,

50:37.160 --> 50:39.760
then low earth orbit, I suspect,

50:39.760 --> 50:42.160
can be done quite cheaply in future.

50:42.160 --> 50:46.040
But going to Mars, which is very, very expensive

50:46.040 --> 50:48.080
and dangerous for humans,

50:48.080 --> 50:52.840
the only people who would go would be these adventurers.

50:52.840 --> 50:55.480
Maybe on one-way trip,

50:55.480 --> 50:57.360
like some of the early polar explorers

50:57.360 --> 50:59.680
and Magellan and people like that,

50:59.680 --> 51:01.120
and we would cheer them on.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.280
And I expect and I very much hope

51:05.280 --> 51:07.400
that by the end of the century,

51:07.400 --> 51:12.040
there will be a small community of such people on Mars

51:13.080 --> 51:14.760
living very uncomfortably,

51:14.760 --> 51:17.040
far less comfortably than at the South Pole

51:17.040 --> 51:19.160
or the bottom of the ocean or the top of Everest.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.320
But they will be there

51:21.280 --> 51:24.800
and they won't have a certain ticket,

51:24.800 --> 51:26.000
but they'll be there.

51:27.400 --> 51:30.200
Incidentally, I think it's a dangerous illusion to think,

51:30.200 --> 51:33.480
as Elon Musk has said,

51:33.480 --> 51:38.480
that we can have mass emigration from the Earth to Mars

51:38.800 --> 51:40.440
to escape the Earth's problems.

51:41.600 --> 51:44.360
It's a dangerous illusion because it's far easier

51:44.360 --> 51:47.120
to deal with climate change on Earth

51:47.120 --> 51:48.960
than to terraform Mars

51:48.960 --> 51:51.800
to make it properly habitable to humans.

51:51.800 --> 51:54.520
So there's no planet B for all of the risk averse people.

51:54.520 --> 51:56.480
But for these crazy adventurers,

51:56.480 --> 52:00.560
then you can imagine that they would be trying to live on Mars

52:00.560 --> 52:03.200
as great pioneers.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.440
And by the end of the century,

52:05.440 --> 52:08.680
then there will be huge advances compared to the present

52:08.680 --> 52:09.600
in two things.

52:09.600 --> 52:12.920
First, in understanding genetics,

52:12.920 --> 52:16.160
so as to genetically redesign one's offspring.

52:16.160 --> 52:19.440
And secondly, to use cyborg techniques

52:19.440 --> 52:22.320
to implant something in our brain

52:22.320 --> 52:25.320
or indeed think about downloading, et cetera.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.040
And those techniques will,

52:28.080 --> 52:30.040
one hopes, be heavily regulated on Earth

52:30.040 --> 52:33.320
on prudentials and ethical grounds.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.520
And of course we are pretty well adapted to the Earth

52:35.520 --> 52:37.840
so we don't have the incentive to do these things

52:37.840 --> 52:39.240
in the way they were there.

52:39.240 --> 52:44.240
So our argument is that it'll be those crazy pioneers

52:46.240 --> 52:50.320
on Mars using all these scientific advances

52:50.320 --> 52:52.720
which will be controlled here,

52:52.720 --> 52:54.320
away from the regulators,

52:54.320 --> 52:58.800
they will transition into a new post-human species.

52:58.800 --> 53:01.160
And so if they do that

53:01.160 --> 53:03.880
and if they transition into something

53:03.880 --> 53:06.040
which is electronic eventually,

53:06.040 --> 53:08.280
because there may be some limits to the capacity

53:08.280 --> 53:11.120
of flesh and blood brains anyways,

53:11.120 --> 53:15.160
then those electronic entities may not want to stay

53:15.160 --> 53:16.240
on a planet like Mars.

53:16.240 --> 53:17.560
They may want to go away.

53:17.560 --> 53:20.200
And so they'll be the precursors

53:20.200 --> 53:24.880
of the future evolution of life and intelligence

53:24.880 --> 53:26.120
coming from the Earth.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.480
And of course there's one point

53:28.480 --> 53:31.840
which perhaps astronomers are more aware of than most people.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.880
Most people are aware that we are the outcome

53:34.880 --> 53:36.800
of four billion years of evolution.

53:37.720 --> 53:41.240
Most of them nonetheless probably think that we humans

53:41.240 --> 53:43.680
are somehow the culmination,

53:43.680 --> 53:44.720
the top of the tree.

53:45.880 --> 53:48.640
But no astronomers can believe that

53:48.640 --> 53:52.080
because astronomers know that the Earth

53:52.080 --> 53:53.880
is four and a half billion years old.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.800
The sun has been shining for that length of time

53:57.800 --> 54:00.920
but the sun has got six billion years more to go

54:00.920 --> 54:03.000
before it flares up and engulfs the inner planet.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.720
So the sun is less than halfway through its life

54:05.720 --> 54:09.520
and the expanding universe goes on far longer still,

54:09.520 --> 54:10.840
maybe forever.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.080
And I'd like to quote Woody Allen

54:12.080 --> 54:15.760
who said eternity is very long, especially towards the end.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.440
So we shouldn't think of ourselves

54:18.440 --> 54:21.000
as maybe even the halfway stage

54:21.000 --> 54:24.280
in the emergence of cosmic complexity.

54:24.280 --> 54:28.040
And so these entities who are post-cursors,

54:28.040 --> 54:31.240
they will go beyond the solar system.

54:31.240 --> 54:33.080
And of course, even if there's nothing else out there

54:33.080 --> 54:38.080
already, then they could populate the rest of the galaxy.

54:38.840 --> 54:40.840
And maybe eventually meet the others

54:40.840 --> 54:42.880
who are out there expanding as well,

54:42.880 --> 54:47.520
expanding and populating with expanded capacity

54:47.520 --> 54:50.600
for life and intelligence, all those kinds of things.

54:50.600 --> 54:55.600
Well, they might, but again, all better off

54:55.680 --> 54:58.600
because I can't conceive what they'd be like.

54:58.600 --> 55:03.600
They won't be green men and women with eyes on stalks,

55:03.800 --> 55:07.280
maybe something quite different, we just don't know.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.000
But there is an interesting question actually

55:09.000 --> 55:11.720
which comes up when I've sometimes spoken to audiences

55:11.720 --> 55:12.680
about this topic,

55:12.680 --> 55:15.560
but the question of consciousness and self-awareness,

55:15.560 --> 55:18.400
because going back to philosophical questions,

55:18.400 --> 55:23.400
I mean, whether an electronic robot would be a zombie

55:25.040 --> 55:27.480
or would it be conscious and self-aware?

55:27.480 --> 55:30.960
And I think there's no way of answering this empirically.

55:32.040 --> 55:35.640
And some people think that consciousness

55:35.640 --> 55:37.800
and self-awareness is an emergent property

55:37.800 --> 55:40.920
in any sufficiently complicated networks that they would be.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.200
Others say, well, maybe it's something special

55:43.200 --> 55:46.360
to the flesh and blood that we're made of, we don't know.

55:46.360 --> 55:49.800
And in a sense, this may not matter

55:49.800 --> 55:53.800
to the way things behave because they could be zombies

55:53.800 --> 55:56.560
and still behave as though they were intelligent.

55:56.560 --> 56:00.240
But I remember after one of my talks,

56:00.240 --> 56:03.000
someone came up and said, wouldn't it be sad

56:03.960 --> 56:06.920
if these future entities,

56:06.920 --> 56:09.520
which were the main intelligent universe,

56:09.520 --> 56:12.280
had no self-awareness, so there was nothing

56:12.280 --> 56:16.360
which could appreciate the wonder and mystery of the universe

56:16.360 --> 56:19.680
and the beauty of the universe in the way that we do.

56:19.680 --> 56:22.720
And so it does perhaps affect one's perspective

56:22.720 --> 56:28.720
of whether you welcome or deplore this possible future scenario,

56:28.720 --> 56:32.320
depending on whether you think the future post-human entities

56:32.560 --> 56:35.960
are conscious and have an aesthetic sense

56:35.960 --> 56:38.200
or whether they're just zombies.

56:38.200 --> 56:42.120
And of course, you have to be humble to realise

56:42.120 --> 56:47.000
that self-awareness may not be the highest form of being,

56:47.920 --> 56:51.960
that humans have a very strong ego

56:51.960 --> 56:54.680
and a very strong sense of identity,

56:54.680 --> 56:57.880
like personal identity connected to this particular brain.

56:57.880 --> 56:59.120
Yeah, yeah.

56:59.120 --> 57:00.360
It's not so obvious to me

57:00.360 --> 57:05.360
that that is somehow the highest achievement of a life form

57:07.320 --> 57:09.120
that maybe this kind of...

57:09.120 --> 57:10.800
Think something collective would be...

57:10.800 --> 57:15.440
It's possible that, well, I think from an alien perspective,

57:15.440 --> 57:18.640
when you look at Earth, it's not so obvious to me

57:18.640 --> 57:23.640
that individual humans are the atoms of intelligence.

57:23.640 --> 57:25.640
It could be the entire organism together,

57:25.640 --> 57:27.400
the collective intelligence.

57:27.400 --> 57:29.680
And so we humans think of ourselves as individuals.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.480
We dress up, we wear ties and suits,

57:31.480 --> 57:33.480
and we give each other prizes.

57:33.480 --> 57:37.080
But in reality, the intelligence,

57:37.080 --> 57:39.040
the things we create that are beautiful

57:39.040 --> 57:41.760
emerges from our interaction with each other.

57:41.760 --> 57:44.120
And that may be where the intelligence is,

57:44.120 --> 57:47.560
ideas jumping from one person to another over generations.

57:47.560 --> 57:49.520
Yes, but we have experiences

57:49.520 --> 57:54.520
where we can appreciate beauty and wonder and all that.

57:54.920 --> 57:58.760
And a zombie may not have those experiences.

57:59.960 --> 58:02.320
Yeah, or it may have a very different...

58:02.320 --> 58:05.600
We have a very black and white, harsh description of zombie,

58:05.600 --> 58:07.920
like a philosophical zombie,

58:07.920 --> 58:10.560
that could be just a very different way to experience.

58:14.000 --> 58:19.000
And in terms of the explorers that colonize Mars,

58:23.360 --> 58:25.120
I mean, there's several things I want to mention.

58:25.120 --> 58:28.000
One, it's just at a high level.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.080
To me, that's one of the most inspiring things

58:30.080 --> 58:34.000
humans can do, is reach out into the unknown.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.480
That's in the space of ideas, in the space of science,

58:36.480 --> 58:38.360
but also the explorers.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.200
No, I agree with that.

58:39.200 --> 58:43.000
And that inspires people here on Earth more.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.560
I mean, it did when going to the moon

58:46.560 --> 58:48.640
or going out to space in the 20th century,

58:48.640 --> 58:51.200
that inspired a generation of scientists.

58:51.200 --> 58:56.200
I think that also could be used to inspire

58:56.280 --> 58:58.800
a generation of new scientists in the 21st century

58:58.800 --> 59:00.280
by reaching out towards Mars.

59:00.280 --> 59:04.200
So in that sense, I think what Elon Musk and others

59:04.200 --> 59:06.440
are doing is actually quite inspiring.

59:06.440 --> 59:10.000
It's not a recreational thing.

59:10.000 --> 59:13.160
It actually has a deep humanitarian purpose

59:13.160 --> 59:16.080
of really inspiring the world.

59:16.080 --> 59:19.880
And then on the other one, to push back on your thought,

59:19.880 --> 59:24.880
I don't think Elon says we want to escape Earth's problems.

59:26.560 --> 59:28.360
It's more that we should allocate

59:28.360 --> 59:33.360
some small percentage of resources to have a backup plan.

59:34.320 --> 59:37.560
And because you yourself have spoken about

59:37.560 --> 59:41.120
and written about all the ways we clever humans

59:41.120 --> 59:45.520
could destroy ourselves, and I'm not sure.

59:45.520 --> 59:49.120
It does seem, when you look at the long arc

59:49.120 --> 59:53.080
of human history, it seems almost obvious

59:53.080 --> 59:56.040
that we need to become a multi-planetary species

59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.400
over a period if we are to survive many centuries.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:04.560
It seems that as we get clever and clever

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.840
with the ways we can destroy ourselves,

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.040
Earth is going to become less and less safe.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.040
So in that sense, this is one of the things,

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.320
people talk about climate change,

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.160
and then we need to respond to climate change,

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.320
and that's a long-term investment we need to make.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.760
But it's not really long-term, it's a span of decades.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.240
I think what Elon is doing

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.560
is a really long-term investment.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.800
We should be working on multi-planetary colonization now

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.520
if we were to have it ready five centuries from now.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.160
And so taking those early steps,

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.400
and then also there's something that happens.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.080
When you go into the unknown

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.880
and do this really difficult thing,

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.440
you discover something very new.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.160
You discover something about robotics

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
or materials engineering or nutrition

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.320
or neuroscience or human relations or political systems

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.320
that actually work well with humans.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.120
You discover all those things.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.200
And so it's a worthy effort to go out there

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.280
and try to become cyborgs.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.800
Yeah, no, I agree with that.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.240
I think the only different point I'd make

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:19.240
is that this is going to be very expensive

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.760
if it's done in a risk averse way.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.880
And that's why I think we should be grateful

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.760
to the billionaires if they're going to sort of foster

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:33.920
these opportunities for thrill-seeking risk takers

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.720
who we can all admire.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.280
Yeah, by the way, I should push back on the billionaires

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.040
because there's sometimes a negative connotation

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:40.880
to the word billionaire.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:43.520
It's not a billionaire, it's a company versus government

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.760
because governments are billionaires and trillionaires.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.440
Yeah, okay. It's not the wealth,

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.600
it's the capitalist imperative,

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:59.240
which I think deserves a lot more praise

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.600
than people are giving it.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.080
I'm troubled by the sort of criticism

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.920
like it's billionaires playing with toys

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.920
for their own pleasure.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:13.040
I think what some of these companies like SpaceX

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.880
and Blue Origin are doing is some of the most inspiring

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.400
engineering and even scientific work

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.840
ever done in human history.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:23.840
No, I agree.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.680
I think the people who've made the greatest wealth

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:29.440
are people who've really been mega benefactors.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.200
I mean, I think...

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.520
Some of them, some of them.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.800
Yeah, some of them, but those who founded Google

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.800
and all that and even Amazon, they're beneficiaries.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.800
Then they're quite different category in my view

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.320
from those who just shuffle around money

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.320
or crypto coins and things like that.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.040
Now you're really talking trash.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:00.040
Yes, but I think if they use their money in these ways,

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.360
that's fine, but I think it's true

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.600
that far more money is owned by us collectively

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.320
as taxpayers, but I think the fact is,

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:12.320
it's in a democracy to be big resistance

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.760
to exposing human beings to very high risks

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.800
if in a sense we share responsibility for it.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.120
And that's the reason I think it would be done

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:24.680
much more cheaply by these private funders.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.200
That's an interesting hypothesis,

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.880
but I have to push back.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.880
I don't know if it's obvious why NASA spends so much money

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:37.480
and takes such a long time to develop

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.440
the things it was doing.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.960
So before Elon Musk came along,

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.640
because I would love to live in a world

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.600
where government actually uses taxpayer money

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.600
to get some of the best engineers and scientists

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.480
in the world and actually work across governments,

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.280
Russia, China, United States, European Union together

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.880
to do some of these big projects.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.080
It's strange that Elon is able to do this much cheaper,

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.560
much faster.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.400
It could have to do with risk aversion, you're right.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.240
But I wonder-

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.440
I think it's that, it's that he had

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.280
all the whole assembly within this one building,

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.360
as it were, rather than depending on a supply chain.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.560
But I think it's also that he had a Silicon Valley culture

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.440
and had younger people,

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.560
whereas the big aerospace companies,

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.880
Boeing and Lockheed Martin,

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.440
they had people who were left over from the Apollo program

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.480
in some cases, and so they weren't quite so lively.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.280
And indeed, quite apart from the controversial issues

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.840
of the future of human space flight,

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.600
in terms of the next generation of big rockets,

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.400
then the one that Musk is going to launch

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.680
for the first time this year, the huge one,

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.040
is going to be far, far cheaper

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.520
than the one that NASA's been working on at the same time.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.440
And that's because it will have a reusable first stage.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.880
And it's going to be great.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.320
It can launch over a hundred tons into Earth orbit.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.360
And it's going to make it feasible

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.440
to do things that I used to think were crazy,

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.640
like having solar energy from space.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.000
That's no longer so crazy, if you can do that.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.760
And also for science, because its nose cone

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:29.200
could contain within it something as big

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.800
as the entire unfurled James Webb telescope mirror.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.280
And therefore you can have a big telescope

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.280
much more cheaply if you can launch it all in one piece.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.040
And so it's going to be hugely beneficial to science

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.200
and to any practical use of space

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.040
to have these cheaper rockets

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.480
that are far more completely reusable than anyways NASA had.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.560
So I think Musk's are a tremendous service

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.520
to space exploration and the whole space technology

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:59.880
through these rockets, certainly.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.240
Plus, it's some big sexy rocket.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.880
It's just great engineering.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.720
Of course, yeah.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.320
It's like looking at a beautiful big bridge

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.880
that humans are capable, us descendants of apes

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.080
are capable to do something so majestic.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.120
Yes, and also the way they land coming down on this bar,

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:16.960
that's amazing.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.720
It's both controls engineering,

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:23.360
it's increasing sort of intelligence in these rockets,

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.120
but also great propulsion engineering materials,

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:28.960
entrepreneurship.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.280
And it just inspires so many people.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.080
No, I'm entirely with you on that.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.880
So would it be exciting to you to see a human being

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.520
step foot on Mars in your lifetime?

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.440
Yes, I think it's unlikely in my lifetime

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.960
since I'm so ancient,

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.760
but I think this century is going to happen.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.200
And I think that will indeed be exciting.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.760
And I hope there will be a small community

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.160
by the end of a century.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:00.000
But as I say, I think they may go with one-way tickets

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.360
or accepting the risk of no return.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.400
So they've got to be people like that.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:10.360
And I still think it's going to be hard to persuade

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.640
the public to send people when you say straight out

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.080
that they may never come back.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.960
Of course, the Apollo astronauts, they took a high risk.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.400
And in fact, in my previous book,

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.120
I quote the speech that's been written for Nixon

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.480
to be read out if Neil Armstrong got stuck on the moon.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.400
It was written by one of his advisors

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:42.400
and very eloquent speech about how they have come

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.480
to a noble end, et cetera.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.040
But of course, there was a genuine risk at that time,

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:52.480
but that may have been accepted,

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.400
but clearly the crashes of the shuttle

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.360
were not acceptable to the American public,

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:03.240
even when they were told that this was only a 2% risk

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.480
given how often they launched it.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.120
And so that's what leads me to think

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:13.120
that it's got to be left to the kind of people

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.640
who are prepared to take these risks.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.800
And I think of American Adventure

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.160
as a guy called Steve Fossett,

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.360
who was an aviator, did all kinds of crazy things,

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.640
and then a guy who fell supersonically

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.400
with the parachute from very high altitude.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.520
All these people, we all cheer them on.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.760
They extend the bounds of humanity.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.080
But I don't think the public will be so happy to fund them.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.720
I mean, I disagree with that.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.400
I think if we change the narrative,

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.440
we should change the story.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.280
You think so?

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.680
I think there's a lot of people,

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:53.520
because the public is happy to fund folks

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.680
in other domains that take bold, giant risks.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.880
First of all, military, for example, military.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.200
In the military, obviously, yes, yes.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.600
I think this is, in the name of science,

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.920
especially if it's sold correctly,

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:07.920
I sure as hell would go up there with a risk.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.800
I would take a 40% chance risk of death

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.040
for something that's...

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.520
I would, I might want to be even older than them now.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.520
But then I would go.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.960
I guess what I'm trying to communicate

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:22.400
is there's a lot of people on earth.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.400
That's the nice feature.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.240
And I'm sure there's going to be a significant percentage

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.360
or some percentage of people that are,

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.360
they take on the risk for the adventure.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:37.120
So, and I particularly love that that risk of adventure

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.240
when taking on inspires people.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.920
And just the ripple effect that has across the generation,

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.280
especially among the young minds,

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.760
is perhaps immeasurable.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.680
But you're thinking

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.240
that sending humans should be something

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.200
we do less and less, sending humans to space.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.960
That it should be primarily an effort.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.640
The work of space exploration

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.520
should be done primarily by robots.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.840
Well, I think it can be done much more cheaply,

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.520
obviously, on Mars.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.320
And no one's thinking of sending humans

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.680
to Enceladus or Europa, the outer planets.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.480
And the point is we will have much better robots

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:22.960
because, let's take an example.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.640
You've seen the pictures of the moons of Saturn

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.640
and the picture of Pluto and the comet taken by probes.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.560
And Cassini spent 13 years going around Saturn

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.600
and its moons after seven year voids.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.720
And those are all based on 1990s technology.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.800
And if you think of how smartphones have advanced

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.400
20 years since then,

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.680
just think how much better one could do

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:52.120
instrumenting some very small sophisticated probe

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.160
that could send dozens of them to explore the outer planets.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.000
And that's the way to do that

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.760
because no one thinks you could send humans that far.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.600
And I would apply the same argument to Mars.

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.040
And if you want to assemble big structures like,

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.560
for instance, radio astronomers would like to have

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:12.480
a big radio telescope on the far side of the moon

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.400
so it's away from the Earth's background,

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.920
artificial radio waves.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:22.800
And that could be done by assembling,

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.480
using robots without people.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.080
So on the moon and on Mars,

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:30.840
I think everything that's useful

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.720
can be done by machines much more cheap than by humans.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.240
Do you know the movie, 2001, A Space Odyssey?

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.200
Of course, yes.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.880
You must be too young to have seen that

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.720
when it came out, obviously.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.880
I remember seeing it when it came out.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.920
You saw it when it came out.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.680
Yeah, yeah, 50 years ago.

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.280
60, when was it?

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.360
60, yeah.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.240
It was.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.080
In the 60s.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.280
Yeah, that's right.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.120
And.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.400
It's still a classic.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.120
It's still probably, for me,

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.400
the greatest AI movie ever made.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.720
Yes, yes, I agree.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.600
One of the great space movies ever made.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.040
So, well, let me ask you a philosophical question

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.560
since we're talking about robots exploring space.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:18.200
Do you think HAL 9000 is good or bad?

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.960
So for people who haven't watched,

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.600
this computer system makes a decision

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.720
to basically prioritize the mission

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.800
that the ship is on over the humans

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.240
that are part of the mission.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.320
Do you think HAL is good or evil?

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.600
If you ask me, probably in that context,

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.680
it was probably good,

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.000
but I think you're raising what is, of course,

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.280
very much active issue in everyday life

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.960
about the extent to which we should

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.640
entrust any important decision to a machine.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.800
And there again, I'm very worried

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:02.800
because I think if you are recommended for an operation

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:06.280
or not given parole from prison

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.520
or even denied credit by your bank,

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.240
you feel you should be entitled to an explanation.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.840
It's not enough to be told that the machine

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.280
has a more reliable record on the whole

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.480
than humans have of making these decisions.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.680
You think you should be given reasons you could understand.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.000
And that's why I think the present societal trend

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.520
to take away the humans

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:36.400
and leave us in the hands of decisions

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:40.160
that we can't contest is a very dangerous one.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.320
I think we've got to be very careful

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.720
of the extent to which AI,

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.400
which can handle lots of information,

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.560
actually makes the decisions without oversight.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.560
And I think we can use them as a supplement

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.720
but to take the case of radiology and cancer.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.440
I mean, it's true that the radiologist

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:07.440
hasn't seen as many x-rays of cancer lungs as the machine.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.520
So the machine could certainly help

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.240
but you want the human to make the final decision.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.120
And I think that's true in most of these instances.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:18.720
But if we turn a bit to the short-term concerns

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.800
with robotics, I think the big worry of course

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.160
is the effect it has on people's self-respect

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:28.640
and their labor market.

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:32.120
And I think my solution will be

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.280
that we should arrange to tax more heavily

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.280
the big international conglomerates

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.040
which use the robots

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.040
and use that tax to fund decently paid dignified posts

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.800
of the kind where being a human being is important.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.360
Above all, carers for old people,

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.240
teachers' assistants for young garters in public parks

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.600
and things like that.

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:05.880
And if the people who are now working in mind-numbing jobs

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:10.880
in Amazon warehouses or in telephone call centers

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.880
are automated, but those same people are given jobs

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.560
where being a human is an asset,

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.680
then that's a plus plus situation.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.960
And so that's the way I think that we should benefit

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.800
from these technologies.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.280
Take over the mind-numbing jobs

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.760
and use machines to make them more efficient

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.760
but enable the people so displaced to do jobs

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.480
where we do want human being.

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:45.040
I mean, most people when they're old,

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.160
the rich people, if they have the choice,

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.600
they want human carers and all that, don't they?

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:53.400
They may want robots to help with some things,

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.040
empty the bedpans and things like that.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.600
But they want real people.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:02.600
And certainly in this country, I think even worse in America,

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:07.200
the care of old people is completely inadequate

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.920
and it needs just more human beings

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.960
to help them cope with everyday life

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.760
and look after them when they're sick.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:17.760
And so that seems to me the way in which

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.280
the money raised in tax from these big companies

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.520
should be deployed.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:22.720
So that's in the short term,

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.480
but if you actually just look,

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.440
the fact is where we are today

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.600
to long-term future in a hundred years,

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.600
it does seem that there is some significant chance

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.640
that the human species is coming to an end

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.440
in its pure biological form.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.960
There's going to be greater and greater integration

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.960
to genetic modification than cyborg type of creatures.

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.000
And so you have to think, all right,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.680
well, we're gonna have to get from here to there.

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.240
And that process is going to be painful.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.400
And there's so many different trajectories

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.320
that take us from one place to another.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:06.000
It does seem that we need to deeply respect

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.560
humanness and humanity,

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:12.280
basic human rights, human welfare,

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:15.000
like happiness and all that kind of stuff.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:15.840
No, absolutely.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.720
And that's why I think we ought to try and slow down

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.000
the application of these human enhancement techniques

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.280
and cyborg techniques for humans for just that reason.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:29.400
I mean, that's why I want to lead into the people on Mars,

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.480
let them do it, but for just that reason.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.320
But they're people too, okay?

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.760
People on Mars are people too.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.400
I tend to, you know.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.440
But they are very poorly adapted to where they are.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.000
That's why they need this modification,

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.920
whereas we're adapted to the earth quite well.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.240
So we don't need these modifications.

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.400
We're happy to be humans living in the environment

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.600
where our ancestors lived.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.040
So we don't have the same motives.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.200
So I think there's a difference.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.520
But I agree, we don't want drastic changes probably

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.400
in our lifestyle.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.360
And that indeed is a worry

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.680
because some things are changing so fast.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.880
But I think I'd like to inject a note of caution.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:15.320
If you think of the way progress in one technology goes,

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.160
it goes in a sort of spurt.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.720
It goes up very fast and then it levels off.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.320
Let me give you two examples.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.920
One we've had already, a human space flight.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.720
At the time of the Apollo program,

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.840
which was only 12 years after Sputnik 1,

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.920
I was alive then and I thought it would only be

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.680
10 or 20 years further before there were footprints on Mars.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.680
But as we know, for reasons we can all understand,

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.920
that was and still remains the high point

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.040
of human space exploration.

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.160
That's because it was funded

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.640
for reasons of superpower rivalry at huge public expense.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.320
But let me give you another case, civil aviation.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.640
If you think of the change between 1919

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.880
when that was Alcock and Brown's first transatlantic fight

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.720
to 1979, the first flight of the jumbo jet,

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.320
it was a big change.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.920
It's more than 50 years since 1969

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.760
and we still have jumbo jets more or less the same.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:20.680
So that's an example of something which developed fast

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:21.520
and changed over.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.800
And to take another analogy,

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.720
we've had huge developments in mobile phones,

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.120
but I suspect the iPhone 24

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.320
may not be too different from the iPhone 13.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.320
They develop, but then they saturate

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.080
and then maybe some new innovation takes over

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.400
in stimulating economic growth.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.600
Yeah, so it's that we have to be cautious

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.920
about being too optimistic

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.160
and we have to be cautious about being too cynical.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.000
I think that is the-

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.640
Well, optimistic is begging the question.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.320
I mean, do we want this rapid change?

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.480
Right, so first of all, there's some degree

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:04.880
to which technological advancement is something,

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.920
is a force that can't be stopped.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.120
And so the question is about directing it

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.080
versus stopping it or slowing it.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.840
It can be sort of slopped or slow.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.400
We'll take human space flight.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.080
There could have been footprints on Mars

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:21.280
if America had gone on spending 4% of the federal budget

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.960
on the project after Apollo.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.280
But the reason-

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.960
So there were very good reasons,

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:31.640
and we could have had supersonic flight,

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.160
but Concorde came and went during the 50 years

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.000
during which we had the jumbo jet.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.360
But the reason it didn't progress

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:42.280
is not because we realized it's not good for human society.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.240
The reason it didn't progress is because it couldn't make,

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.920
sort of from a capitalist perspective, it couldn't make,

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.240
there was no short-term or long-term way

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.480
for it to make money.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.200
So for me-

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.720
But that's the same as saying it's not good for society.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.720
I don't think everything that makes money

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.400
is good for society and everything that doesn't make money

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.680
is bad for society, right?

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:12.040
That's a difficult thing we're always contending with

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.160
when we look at social networks.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.120
It's not obvious, even though they make

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.440
a tremendous amount of money,

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.200
that they're good for society,

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.000
especially how they're currently implemented

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.160
with advertisement and engagement maximization.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.960
So that's the constant struggle of-

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:28.480
Oh, you know, I agree with you.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:30.520
Many innovations are damaging.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:32.680
Yes, yes, yes.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.840
Well-

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.680
But I would have thought that supersonic flight

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:39.720
was something that would benefit only a tiny elite

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.520
at a huge expense and environmental damage.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.120
That was obviously something

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.800
which they're very glad not to have, in my opinion.

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.840
Yeah, but perhaps there was a way to do it

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.960
where it could benefit the general populace.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.960
If you were to think about airplanes,

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.960
wouldn't you think that in the early days,

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.960
airplanes would have been seen as something

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:02.960
that can surely only benefit 1% at most of the population,

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.440
as opposed to a much larger percentage.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:08.840
There's another aspect of capital,

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.720
a system that's able to drive down costs

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.800
once you get the thing kind of going.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:16.240
So, you know, we get together maybe with taxpayer money

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.400
and get the thing going at first,

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.440
and once it gets going, companies step up

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.160
and drive down the cost and actually make it

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.480
so that blue collar folks can actually start using the stuff.

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.320
Yeah, sometimes that does happen, that's good.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.040
So that's, again, the double-edged sword

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:38.040
of human civilization, that some technology hurts us,

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.760
some benefits us, and we don't know ahead of time.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.120
We can just do our best.

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.520
There's a gap between what could be done

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:48.120
and what we collectively decide to do.

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.160
Yes.

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.640
In that we could push forward some developments

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.320
faster than we do.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.880
Let me ask you, in your book

01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.360
On the Future Prospects for Humanity,

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.400
you imagine a time machine that allows you

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.160
to send a tweet-length message to scientists in the past,

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.280
like to Newton.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.280
Yes.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.680
What tweet would you send?

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.360
That's an interesting thought experiment.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.560
What message would you send to Newton

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.360
about what we know today?

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.880
Well, I think he'd love to know

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.080
that there were planets around other stars.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.920
He'd like to know that-

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.080
That would really blow his mind.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.840
He'd like to know that everything was made of atoms.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:29.640
He'd like to know that if he looked a bit more carefully

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:33.960
through his prisms and looked at light,

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:38.600
not just from the sun, but from some flames,

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.560
he might get the idea that different surfaces

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.000
emitted light of different colors,

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.440
and he might have been twigged to discover some things

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.440
that had to wait two or 300 years.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.080
Could have given him those clues, I think.

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.160
It's fascinating to think, to look back

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.960
at how little he understood,

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.520
people at that time understood about our world,

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:06.280
and how much we've-

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.920
And certainly about the cosmos, because of course-

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.000
About the cosmos, yes.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.600
Well, if we think about astronomy,

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:14.000
then until about 1850,

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:20.200
astronomy was a matter of the positions

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.960
of how the stars and the planets moved around, et cetera.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:25.840
That goes back a long way,

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.000
but Newton understood why the planets moved around in ellipses,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.880
but he didn't understand why the solar system

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:37.720
was all in a plane, what we call the ecliptic,

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.880
and he didn't understand it.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:42.760
No one did till the mid-19th century

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.200
what the stars are made of.

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.240
We thought they were made of some fifth essence,

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.960
not earth, earth, iron, water, like everything else,

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.280
and it was only after 1850,

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:56.280
when people did use prisms more precisely to get spectra,

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:59.360
that they realized that the sun was made

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:03.800
of the same stuff as the earth, and indeed the stars were.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:08.400
And it wasn't till 1930 that people

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.720
knew about nuclear energy

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.560
and knew what kept the sun shining for so long.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.000
So it was quite late that some of these key ideas came in,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.360
which would have completely transformed Newton's views,

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.680
and of course, the entire scale of the galaxy

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.280
and the rest of the universe.

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:29.560
Just imagine what he would have thought about the Big Bang,

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.320
or even just general relativity, just gravity,

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.760
just him and Einstein talking for a couple weeks.

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.520
Would he be able to make sense of space-time

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.280
and the curvature of space-time?

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.440
Well, I think, given a quick course,

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.240
I mean, he was sort of, if one looks back,

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:52.760
he was really a unique intellect in a way,

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.760
and he said that he thought better than everything,

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.840
everyone else, by thinking on things continually

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.560
and thinking very deep thoughts.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.600
And so he was an utterly remarkable intellect, obviously.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.640
But of course, scientists aren't all like that.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.440
I think one thing that's interesting to me,

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.560
having spent a life among scientists,

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:17.560
what a variety of mindsets and mental styles they have.

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.520
And well, just to contrast,

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.600
Newton and Darwin,

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.760
Darwin said, and he's probably correct,

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.760
that he thought he just had as much sort of a common sense

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:36.720
and reasoning power as the average lawyer.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:39.080
And that's probably true,

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:42.400
because his ability was to sort of connect data

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.000
and think through things deeply.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.280
That's a quite different kind of thinking

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.520
from what was involved in Newton

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.480
or someone doing abstract mathematics.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.760
I think in the 20th century, the coolest,

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:57.760
well, there's the theory,

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.000
but from an astronomy perspective,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
black holes is one of the most fascinating entities

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.200
to have been through theory and through experiment

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.440
to have emerged from.

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.280
Obviously, I agree.

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.920
It's an amazing story that, well, of course,

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.720
what's interesting is Einstein's reaction,

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:22.200
because, of course, although, as you know,

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.880
we now accept this is one of the most remarkable predictions

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.440
of Einstein's theory,

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.960
he never took it seriously, even believed it,

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.600
although it was a consequence of a series of his equations

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.680
which someone discovered just a year after his theory,

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:41.240
Schwarzschild, but he never took it seriously,

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.560
and others did.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.960
But then, of course, well, this is something

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.760
I've been involved in actually finding evidence

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.400
for black holes, and that's come in the last 50 years,

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.680
and so now there's pretty compelling evidence

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.160
that they exist as the remnants of stars

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.520
or big ones in a sense of galaxies,

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:04.920
and we understand what's going on.

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.680
We have ideas vaguely on how they form,

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:12.560
and, of course, gravitational waves have been detected,

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.360
and that's an amazing piece of technology.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.640
LIGO is one of the most incredible engineering efforts

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:18.480
of all time.

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.960
That's an example where the engineers deserve

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.880
the most of the credit, because the precision is,

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:27.440
as I said, it's like measuring the thickness of a hair

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:29.120
at the distance of Alpha Centauri.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.560
Yeah, it's incredible.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.600
10 to the minus 21.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.080
So maybe, actually, if we step back,

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:34.320
what are black holes?

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.200
What do we humans understand about black holes,

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.320
and what's still unknown?

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.920
Einstein's theory,

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.400
extended by people like Roger Penrose,

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.760
tells us that black holes are, in a sense,

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.520
well, the simple things, basically,

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.520
because they are solutions of Einstein's equations,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.360
and the thing that was shown in the 1960s

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.200
by Roger Penrose in particular, and by a few other people,

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.760
was that a black hole, when it forms and settles down,

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.200
is defined just by two quantities,

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.160
it's mass and it's spin.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.720
So they're actually very standardized objects.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:16.680
It's amazing that objects as standardized as that

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.520
can be so big and can lurk in the rest of the solar system.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:25.520
And so that's the situation for a ready-formed black hole,

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:27.280
but the way they form, obviously,

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:30.320
is very messy and complicated.

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:34.760
And one of the things that I've worked on a lot

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:37.800
is what the phenomena are,

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.680
which are best attributed to black holes

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.840
and what may lead to them and all that.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.160
And-

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.560
Wichita, can you explain to that?

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.520
So what are the different phenomena

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.720
that lead to a black hole?

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:49.080
Okay, well, let's talk about it.

01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:49.920
This is so cool.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.760
Okay, well.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.600
This is so cool.

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.760
Yes, okay, okay.

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:54.680
Well, I mean, I think one thing

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:58.360
that only became understood, really, in the 1950s,

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:00.320
I suppose, and beyond,

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.480
was how stars evolve differently,

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.680
depending on how heavy they are.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:10.240
The sun burns hydrogen to helium,

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.520
and then when it's run out of that,

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.800
it contracts to be a white dwarf.

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.480
And we know how long that will take.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.520
It'll take about 10 billion years altogether

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:18.880
for its lifetime.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.360
But big stars burn up their fuel more quickly

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.200
and more interestingly

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.760
because when they've turned hydrogen to helium,

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:27.840
they then get even hotter,

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.040
so they can fuse helium into carbon

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.120
and go up the periodic table.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:34.720
And then they eventually explode

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.400
when they have an energy crisis.

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.240
And they blow out that process material,

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.720
which, as a digression, is crucially important

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:45.680
because all the atoms inside our bodies

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:48.640
were synthesized inside a star,

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:49.800
a star that lived and died

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:51.560
more than five billion years ago

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.360
before our solar system formed.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.160
And so we each have inside us

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.520
atoms made in thousands of different stars

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.360
all over the Milky Way.

01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.480
And that's an amazing idea.

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:02.880
My predecessor, Fred Hoyle, in 1946,

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.960
was the first person to suggest that idea.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.800
And that's been born out.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.440
So that's how massive stars explode.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.320
And they leave behind something

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.160
which is very exotic and of two kinds.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.040
One possibility is a neutron star,

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.160
and these were first discovered in 1967, 68.

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.520
These are stars a bit heavier than the Sun,

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.160
which are compressed to an amazing density.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.800
So the whole mass, more than the Sun's mass,

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.200
is in something about 10 miles across.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.560
So they're extraordinarily dense,

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.000
they're exotic physics.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:46.920
And they've been studied in immense detail

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.600
and they've been real laboratories

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.000
because the good thing about astronomy,

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.240
apart from exploring what's out there,

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.440
is to use the fact that the cosmos

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.120
has provided us with a lab

01:31:57.120 --> 01:31:58.600
with far more extreme conditions

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:00.080
than we could ever simulate.

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.520
And so we learn lots of basic physics

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.920
from looking at these objects.

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.960
And that's been true of neutrons.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.600
But for black holes, that's even more true

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.880
because the bigger stars, when they collapse,

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.840
they leave something behind in the center

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.080
which is too big to be a stable white

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.760
or four-neutron star and becomes a black hole.

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:22.240
And we know that there are lots of black holes

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:27.120
weighing about 10 or up to 50 times as much as the Sun,

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.680
which are the remnants of stars.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.720
They were detected first 50 years ago

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:36.680
when a black hole was orbiting around another star

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.480
and grabbing material from the other star

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:42.160
which swirled into it and gave us x-rays.

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:45.960
So the x-ray astronomers found these objects

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:50.200
orbiting around an ordinary star

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.760
and emitting x-ray radiation very intensely

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.680
varying on a very short time scale.

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:57.720
So something very small and dense

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.920
was giving that radiation.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.000
That was the first evidence for black holes.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.880
But then the other thing that happened

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.800
was realizing that there was a different class

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.080
of monster black holes in the centers of galaxies.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:13.240
And these are responsible for what's called quasars

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.960
which is when something in the center of a galaxy

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.560
is grabbing some fuel and outshines

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.440
all the hundred billion stars or so

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.720
in the rest of the galaxy.

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.440
A giant beam of light.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.240
And in many cases, it's a beam of light.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.240
That's gotta be the most epic thing

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.440
the universe produces is quasars.

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.600
Well, it's a debate of what's the most epic

01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.360
but quasars maybe, or maybe gamma ray bursts or something.

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.920
But they are remarkable

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.720
and they were a mystery for a long time.

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.040
And they're one of the things I worked on

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:49.040
in my younger days.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.360
So even though they're so bright,

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.480
they're still a mystery.

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.240
And you can only see them.

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.080
They're a little mystery now.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:58.240
I think we do understand basically what's going on.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.440
How were quasars discovered?

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:03.840
Well, they were discovered when astronomers found things

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.040
that looked like stars

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.040
and that they were small enough to be a point-like

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.880
and not resolved by a telescope,

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.560
but outshone an entire galaxy.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.880
Yeah, that's suspicious.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:20.240
Yes, but then they realized that what they were,

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:26.320
they were objects which you now know are black holes.

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:31.000
And they were, black holes were capturing gas

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.920
and that gas was getting very hot,

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.960
but it was producing far more energy

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.920
than all the stars added together.

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:43.000
And it was the energy of the black hole

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.760
that was lighting up all the gas in the galaxy.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.160
So you've got a spectrum of it there.

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.080
So this was something which was realized

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.560
from the 1970s onwards.

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.960
And as you say, the other thing we've learned

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:59.920
is that they often do produce these jets squirting out,

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.840
which could be detected in all wave bands.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.520
So there's now a star picture.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.480
Black hole generating jets of light

01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:11.320
in the center of most galaxies.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.480
Do we know, do we have a sense

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:18.480
if every galaxy has one of these big boys, big black holes?

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.760
Most galaxies have big black holes.

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:21.600
They're very in size.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.000
The one in our galactic center.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.760
Do we know much about ours?

01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.560
We do, yes.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.560
We know it weighs about as much as 4 million suns,

01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.760
which is less than some,

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.840
it's a several billion of the galaxies.

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.600
But we know this one in our galactic center

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:44.160
isn't very bright or conspicuous.

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.880
And that's because not much is falling into it

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.800
at the moment.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.480
If a black hole is isolated,

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.360
then of course it doesn't radiate it.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.360
Only all that radiates is gas swirling into it,

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.640
which gets very hot or has magnetic fields.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.800
It's only radiating the thing it's murdering

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.960
or consuming, however you put it.

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:02.960
Yeah, that's right.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:05.760
And so it's thought that our galaxy

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.720
may have been bright at some time in the past.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.560
But now, and that's when the black hole formed or grew,

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:17.680
but now it's not capturing very much gas.

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.600
And so it's rather faint and detected indirectly

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.840
and by fairly weak radio emission.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:27.400
And so I think the answer to your question

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.720
is that we suspect that most galaxies

01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.480
have a black hole in them.

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:36.560
So that means at some stage in their lives,

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:38.120
or maybe one or more stages,

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.360
they went through a phase of being like a quasar

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:43.640
where that black hole captured gas

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.360
and became very, very bright.

01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.560
But for the rest of their lives,

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.440
the black holes are fairly quiescent

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.320
because there's not much gas falling into them.

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:57.160
And so this universe of ours sprinkled a bunch of galaxies

01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:02.160
and giant black holes with very large number of stars

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.160
orbiting these black holes and then planets orbiting.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:12.400
Likely, it seems like planets orbiting

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.480
almost every one of those stars

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:19.200
and just this beautiful universe of ours.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.880
Well, what happens when galaxies collide,

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.320
when these two big black holes collide?

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.160
Is that-

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.280
Well, what would happen is that,

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:33.000
well, and I should say that this is gonna happen

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.680
near us one day, but not for 4 billion years

01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:37.000
because the Andromeda galaxy,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.440
which is the biggest galaxy near to us,

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:44.040
which is about nearly 3 million light years away,

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:47.240
which is a big disc galaxy with a black hole in its hub,

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.200
rather like our Milky Way.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.320
And that's falling towards us

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.800
because they're both in a common

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.840
gravitational potential well.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.800
And that will collide with our galaxy

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.200
in about 4 billion years.

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.400
But it'll be, maybe it'll be less a collision

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.440
and more of a dance

01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.560
because there'll be like a swirling situation.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:10.360
Well, it's a swirling, but eventually there'll be a merger.

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:13.000
They'll go through each other and then merge.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.040
In fact, the nice movies to be made of this,

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.560
computer simulations.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.720
And it'll go through.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:25.360
And then there's a black hole

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.000
in the sense of Andromeda and our galaxy.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.080
And the galaxy, the black holes

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.960
will settle towards the center.

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:33.800
Yes.

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.800
Then they will orbit around each other very fast.

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.040
And then they will eventually merge.

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:41.960
And that'll produce a big burst of gravitational waves.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:42.800
Yes.

01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:43.680
A very big burst.

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.440
That an alien civilization with a LIGO-like detector

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.960
will be able to detect.

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.800
Yes.

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:50.360
Well, in fact, we can detect these

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.440
with their lower frequencies

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:56.840
than the ways that have been detected by LIGO.

01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:00.880
So there's a space interferometer which can detect these.

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:03.720
They're about, it's about one cycle per hour

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:06.120
rather than about a hundred cycles per second.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:06.960
Yes.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.120
It's the ones that detect it.

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.000
But that will happen.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.920
But thinking back to what will happen in 4 billion years

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:17.160
to any of our descendants, they'll be okay

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.920
because the two disk galaxies will merge.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:24.800
It'll end up as a sort of amorphous elliptical galaxy.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.720
But the stars won't be much closer together than they are now.

01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.240
It'll still be just twice as many stars

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.040
in a structure almost as big.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:39.040
And so the chance of another star colliding with our sun

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.800
would still be very small.

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.640
Yeah.

01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.080
Because there's actually a lot of space

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.240
between stars and planets.

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:47.000
Yes, the chance of a star getting close enough

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:49.880
to affect our solar system's orbit is small

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.640
and it won't change that very much.

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:53.600
So you can be reassured.

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.280
A heck of a starry sky though.

01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.120
What would that look like?

01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:58.960
Well, it won't make much difference

01:39:58.960 --> 01:39:59.800
even to that actually.

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:00.640
It'll just be.

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.920
Wouldn't that look kind of beautiful when you're swirling?

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.760
Oh, because it's swirling so slow.

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.680
Yeah, they're far away.

01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:10.520
So it'll be twice as many stars in the sky.

01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:11.360
Yeah.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.080
But the pattern changes in interesting ways.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.640
Yeah, the pattern will change a bit

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.600
and there won't be the Milky Way

01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:19.360
because the Milky Way across the sky

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:22.120
is because we are looking in the disk of our galaxy

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:27.120
and you lose that because the disk will be sort of disrupted

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.240
and it'll be a more sort of spherical distribution.

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.880
And of course, many galaxies are like that.

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.440
And that's probably because they have been

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.320
through mergers of this kind.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.160
If we survive four billion years,

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.520
we would likely be able to survive beyond that.

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:41.360
Oh yeah.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.240
What's the other thing on the horizon for humans

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.480
in terms of the sun burning out,

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.560
all those kinds of interesting cosmological threats

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.400
to our civilization?

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.600
Well, I think on the cosmological time scale,

01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.760
of course, it won't be humans

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.760
because even if evolution's got no faster than Darwinian,

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:07.240
and it will be faster than Darwinian in the future,

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:10.600
then we're thinking about six billion years

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.800
before the sun dies.

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.800
So any entities watching the death of the sun,

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:16.760
if they're still around,

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.200
they'd be as different from much as we are

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:20.240
from slime mold or something,

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:24.440
and far more different still if they become electronic.

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.560
So on that time scale, we just can't predict anything.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.560
But I think going back to the human time scale,

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:37.960
then we've talked about whether there'll be people on Mars

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.600
by the end of a century.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.120
And even in these long perspectives,

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.480
then indeed this century is very special

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:47.200
because it may see the transition

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.920
between purely flesh and blood entities

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.000
to those with our sort of cyborgs.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.440
And that'll be an important transition

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:59.440
in biology and complexity in this century.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.760
But of course, the other importance,

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.240
and this has been the theme of a couple of my older books,

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:08.560
is that this is the first century when one species,

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:12.920
namely our species, has the future of the planet in his hands.

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:17.880
And that's because of two types of concerns.

01:42:17.880 --> 01:42:20.400
One is that there are more of us,

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.640
we're more demanding of energy and resources,

01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.640
and therefore we are for the first time

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:32.040
changing the whole planet through climate change,

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.440
loss of biodiversity and all those issues.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.760
This has never happened in the past

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.160
because having enough humans have been much in part.

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.520
So this is an effect that obviously

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.760
is high on everyone's agenda now, and rightly so,

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.640
because we've got to ensure that we leave a heritage

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.600
that isn't eroded or damaged to future generations.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.960
And so that's one class of threats.

01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.320
But there's another thing that worries me,

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.920
perhaps more than many people seem to worry,

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:06.640
and that's the threat of misuse of technology.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:11.920
And so this is particularly because technologies

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:17.040
empower even small groups of malevolent people,

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.480
or indeed even careless people,

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:24.520
to create some effect which could cascade globally.

01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:29.520
And to take an example, a dangerous pathogen or pandemic.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:36.640
I mean, my worst nightmare is that there could be

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:41.800
some small group that can engineer a virus

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.920
to make it more virulent or more transmissible

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.440
than a natural virus.

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.280
This is so-called gain-of-function experiments

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:50.960
which were done on the flu virus 10 years ago

01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.720
and can be done for others.

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.000
And of course, we now know from COVID-19

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.240
that our world is so interconnected

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:03.720
that a disaster in one part of the world

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:06.560
can't be confined to that part and will spread globally.

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:10.200
So it's possible for a few dissidents

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.720
with expertise in biotech

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.520
could create a global catastrophe of that kind.

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:18.480
And also, I think we need to worry about

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:21.640
very large-scale disruption by cyber attacks.

01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:25.320
In fact, I quote in one of my books,

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:29.280
a 2012 report from the American Pentagon

01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:34.000
about the possibility of a state-level cyber attack

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.280
on the electricity grid in Eastern United States,

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:39.520
which as it could happen.

01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.440
And it says at the end of this chapter

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:45.720
that this would merit a nuclear response.

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:47.200
This is a pretty scary possibility.

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:48.760
That was 10 years ago.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:53.000
And I think now what would have needed a state actor then

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.960
could be done perhaps by a small group empowered by AI.

01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.880
And so there's obviously been an arms race

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.880
between the cyber criminals and the cyber security people.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:07.440
Not clear which side is winning.

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:11.240
But the main point is that as we become more dependent

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:16.240
on more integrated systems, then we get more vulnerable.

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:21.240
And so we have the knowledge,

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.280
then the misuse of that knowledge

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:25.800
becomes more and more of a threat.

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:30.800
And bio and cyber are the two biggest concerns.

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:36.120
And if we depend too much on AI and complex systems,

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.960
then just breakdowns.

01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:39.760
It may be that they break down.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:42.800
And even if it's an innocent breakdown,

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:44.480
then it may be pretty hard to mend it.

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:47.920
And just think how much worse the pandemic would have been

01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.400
if we'd lost the internet in the middle of it.

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:52.800
And it must be dependent more than ever

01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.120
for communication and everything else

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.160
on the internet and Zooms and all that.

01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.960
And if that had broken down,

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.640
that would have made things far worse.

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:04.160
And those are the kinds of threats

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:07.280
that we I think need to be more energized

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.320
and politicians need to be more energized to minimize.

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:14.120
And one of the things I've been doing the last year

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:17.120
through being a member of our, part of our parliament

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.240
is sort of, I have to instigate a committee

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.600
to think more on better preparedness

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:26.040
for extreme technological risks and things like that.

01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:29.280
So they're a big concern in my mind

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:33.640
that we've got to make sure that we can benefit

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.680
from these advances but safely

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.960
because the stakes are getting higher

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.240
and the benefits are getting great as we know,

01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:45.440
huge benefits from computers,

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.840
but also huge downsides as well.

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.840
And one of the things this war in Ukraine has shown,

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.120
one of the most terrifying things

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:57.160
outside of the humanitarian crisis

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.880
is that at least for me, I realized

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.720
that the human capacity to initiate nuclear war

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:11.800
is greater than I thought.

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:15.360
I thought the lessons of the past have been learned.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:19.160
It seems that we hang on the brink of nuclear war

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:22.560
with this conflict, like every single day

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.560
with just one mistake or bad actor

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:32.040
or the actual leaders of the particular nations

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:36.280
launching a nuclear strike and all hell breaks loose.

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:39.840
So then add into that picture, cyber attacks and so on,

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:43.560
they can lead to confusion and chaos

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:46.040
and then out of that confusion,

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:52.080
calculations are made such that a nuclear launch is,

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.480
a nuclear weapon is launched and it's,

01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.400
and then you're talking about, I mean, I don't,

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.960
direct probably 60, 70% of humans on earth

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:08.040
are dead instantly and then the rest,

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.280
I mean, it's basically 99% of the human population

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:14.960
is wiped out in the period of five years.

01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:16.280
Well, it may not be that bad,

01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:19.560
but it would be a devastation for civilization, of course.

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:21.040
And of course, you're quite right

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:23.680
that this could happen very quickly

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.440
because of information coming in

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.280
and there's a, there's hardly enough time

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:34.760
for human collected and careful thought

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:39.040
and there have been recorded cases of false alarms.

01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:43.520
There's several where they've been suspected attacks

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.840
from the other side and fortunately,

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.760
they've been realized to be false alarms soon enough,

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.480
but this could happen.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:52.480
And there's a new class of threats actually,

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:54.480
which in our center in Cambridge,

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:55.920
people are thinking about,

01:48:55.920 --> 01:49:00.920
which is that the commander control system

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:06.000
of the nuclear weapons and the submarine fleets

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.720
and all that is now more automated

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:11.640
and could be subject to cyber attacks.

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:15.840
And that's a new threat which didn't exist 30 years ago.

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.960
And so I think indeed it's,

01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.680
we're in a sort of scary world, I think.

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.160
And it's because things happen faster

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.600
and human beings aren't in such direct

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.160
and immediate control because so much is delegated

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.200
to machines and also because the world

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.440
is so much more interconnected,

01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:42.440
then some local event can cascade globally

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:45.840
in a way it never could in the past and much faster.

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:47.400
Yeah, it's a double-edged sword

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:50.840
because the interconnectedness brings

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:57.520
a higher quality of life across a lot of metrics.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:49:59.960
Yeah, it can do, but of course there again,

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.120
I mean, if you think of supply chains

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:04.000
where we get stuff from around the world

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
and one lesson we've learned is that there's a trade-off

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.720
between resilience and efficiency

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:14.720
and it's resilient to have an inventory and stock

01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:17.480
and to depend on local supplies,

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:22.160
whereas the more efficient to have long supply chains.

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:26.320
But the risk there is that a break in one link

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:29.760
in one chain can screw up car production.

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:31.760
This has already happened in the pandemic.

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:34.520
So there's a trade-off and there are other examples.

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:36.440
I mean, for instance, the other thing we learned

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:41.040
was that it may be efficient to have 95%

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:44.320
of your hospital intensive care beds occupied all the time,

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.320
which has been the UK situation,

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:47.560
whereas to do what the Germans do

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:50.640
and always keep 20% of them free for an emergency

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:52.720
is really a sensible precaution.

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:56.280
And so I think we've probably learned

01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:58.680
a lot of lessons from COVID-19

01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:02.360
and they would include rebalancing the trade-off

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:05.600
between resilience and efficiency.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:09.400
Boy, the fact that COVID-19,

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:12.880
a pandemic that could have been a lot, a lot worse,

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:15.520
brought the world to its knees anyway.

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.680
It could be far worse in terms of its fatality rate

01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:20.280
or something like that. Fatality rate, yeah.

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.760
So the fact that that, I mean,

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:26.360
it revealed so many flaws in our human institutions.

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.760
Yeah, yeah.

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:30.520
Yes, and then I think I'm rather pessimistic

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:35.520
because I do worry about the bad actor

01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.600
or the small group who can produce catastrophe.

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:45.880
And if you imagine someone with access

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:47.400
to the kind of equipment that's available

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.720
in university labs or industrial labs,

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:53.760
and they could create some dangerous pathogen,

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.480
then even one such person is too many.

01:51:57.400 --> 01:51:58.400
And how can we stop that?

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:02.600
Because it's true that you can have regulations.

01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:04.800
I mean, academies are having meetings, et cetera,

01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:09.480
about how to regulate these new biological experiments,

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:10.800
et cetera, make them safe.

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:13.520
But even if you have all these regulations,

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:18.040
then enforcing regulations is pretty hopeless.

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:20.280
We can't enforce the tax laws globally.

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:23.080
We can't enforce the drug laws globally.

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:26.040
And so similarly, we can't readily enforce

01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:30.600
the laws against people doing these dangerous experiments,

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.880
even if all the governments say they should be prohibited.

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:38.760
And so my line on this is that all nations

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:40.040
are going to face a big trade-off

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.040
between three things we value,

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.640
freedom, security, and privacy.

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:50.600
And I think different nations

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:54.400
will make that choice differently.

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:56.880
The Chinese would give up privacy

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:01.920
and have certainly more security, if not more liberty.

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:06.920
But I think in our countries,

01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:10.600
I think we're going to have to give up more privacy

01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:11.720
in the same way.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:13.800
That's a really interesting trade-off.

01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:17.400
But there's also something about human nature here,

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:19.280
where I personally believe

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:22.720
that all humans are capable of good and evil.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:26.320
And there's some aspect to which we can fight this

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:30.480
by encouraging people,

01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:33.240
incentivizing people towards

01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:35.600
the better angels of their nature.

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:39.120
So in order for a small group of people to create,

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.640
to engineer deadly pathogens,

01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:45.080
you have to have people that,

01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:48.360
for whatever trajectory took them in life,

01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.360
wanting to do that kind of thing.

01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:55.360
And if we can aggressively work on a world

01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:59.720
that sort of sees the beauty in everybody

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:03.160
and encourages the flourishing of everybody

01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:05.200
in terms of mental health, in terms of meaning,

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:06.800
in terms of all those kinds of things,

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:10.520
that's one way to fight the development

01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:14.400
of weapons that can lead to atrocities.

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:16.400
Yes, and I completely agree with that,

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:19.760
and to reduce the reason why people feel embittered.

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.880
Yes.

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.360
But of course, we've got a long way to go to do that,

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.840
because if you look at the present world,

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:31.360
nearly everyone in Africa has reason to feel embittered,

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:36.360
because their economic development is lagging behind

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.840
most of the rest of the world,

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.800
and the prospects of getting out of the poverty trap

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:44.840
is rather bleak, especially as the population grows,

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:46.200
because for instance,

01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.480
they can't develop like the Eastern Tigers

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.560
by cheap manufacturing,

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.360
because robots are taking that over,

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:56.360
so they naturally feel embittered by the inequality.

01:54:56.960 --> 01:54:59.280
And of course, what we need to have

01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:02.400
is some sort of mega version of the Marshall Plan

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.560
that helped Europe in the post-World War II era

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.560
to enable Africa to develop.

01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:11.960
That would be not just an altruistic thing for Europe to do,

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.720
but in our interest, because otherwise,

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:20.360
those in Africa will feel massively disaffected.

01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.720
And indeed, it's a manifestation

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:24.000
of the excessive inequalities,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.560
the fact that the 2,000 richest people in the world

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:29.160
have enough money to double the income

01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:30.680
of the bottom billion.

01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:35.360
And that's an indictment of the ethics of the world.

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:39.440
And this is where my friend Stephen Pinker and I

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:40.320
have had some contact.

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:44.920
We wrote joint articles on bio threats and all that.

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:49.120
But he writes these books being very optimistic

01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:54.120
about quoting figures about how life expectancy has gone up,

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.680
infant mortality has gone down,

01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:58.200
literacy has gone up, and all those things,

01:55:58.200 --> 01:55:59.800
and he's quite right about that.

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:02.360
And so he says the world's getting better.

01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:06.320
Do you disagree with your friends too, Pinker?

01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:09.600
Well, I mean, I agree with those facts, okay?

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:12.880
But I think he misses out part of the picture

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:15.960
because there's a new class of threats

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:18.880
which hang over us now,

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.840
which didn't hang over us in the past.

01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:24.560
And I would also question whether we have collectively

01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:26.040
improved our ethics at all,

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:29.160
because let's think back to the Middle Ages.

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:30.840
It's true that, as Pinker says,

01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.640
the average person was in a more miserable state

01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.320
than they are today on average.

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:40.760
For all the reasons he quantifies, that's fine.

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:44.600
But in the Middle Ages, there wasn't very much

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:48.920
that could have been done to improve people's lot in life

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:52.520
because of lack of knowledge and lack of science, et cetera.

01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.480
So the gap between the way the world was,

01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.680
which is pretty miserable,

01:56:56.680 --> 01:56:58.800
and the way the world could have been,

01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:00.320
which wasn't all that much better,

01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.760
was fairly narrow.

01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:04.920
Whereas now, the gap between the way the world is

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.960
and the way the world could be is far, far wider.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
And therefore, I think we are ethically more at fault

01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:17.000
in allowing this gap to get wider

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.920
than it was in medieval times.

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:22.360
And so I would very much question and dispute

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:25.560
the idea that we are ethically

01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:28.160
in advance of our predecessors collectively.

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.440
There's a lot of interesting hypotheses in there.

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:35.600
It's a fascinating question of how much

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:38.480
is the size of that gap between the way the world is

01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:39.800
and the way the world could be

01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:41.920
is a reflection of our ethics,

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:44.120
or maybe sometimes it's just a reflection

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:45.880
of a very large number of people.

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:49.520
Maybe it's a technical challenge, too.

01:57:49.520 --> 01:57:50.360
It's not just-

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:51.960
Well, of our political systems.

01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:54.160
Political systems, like how many.

01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:56.080
And we're trying to figure this thing out.

01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:57.960
There's the 20th century,

01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:01.400
tried this thing that sounded really good on paper

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:04.800
of collective, the communism type of things.

01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.280
And it's like, ooh, turned out

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.600
at least the way that was done there,

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:10.720
that leads to atrocities and the suffering

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.560
and the murder of tens of millions of people.

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:14.800
Okay, so that didn't work.

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.520
Let's try democracy.

01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.760
And that seems to have a lot of flaws,

01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:21.040
but it seems to be the best thing we've got so far.

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:22.760
So we're trying to figure this out

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.480
as our technologies become more and more powerful,

01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:28.320
have the capacity to do a lot of good to the world,

01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:30.240
but also unfortunately have the capacity

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:33.360
to destroy the entirety of the human civilization.

01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:35.760
And I think it's social media generally,

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:40.760
which makes it harder to get a sort of moderate consensus

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:45.880
because in the old days when people got their news

01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:47.920
filtered through responsible journalists

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:51.760
in this country, the BBC and the main newspapers, et cetera,

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:54.640
they would muffle the crazy extremes.

01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:58.400
Whereas now, of course, they're on the internet

01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:00.880
and if you click on them, you get to the more extreme.

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:05.280
And so I think we are seeing a sort of dangerous polarization

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:07.680
which I think is gonna make all countries harder to govern

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:10.440
and that's something which I'm pessimistic about.

01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:13.800
So to push back, it is true that brilliant people

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:16.720
like you highlighting the limitations of social media

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:20.560
is making you realize the stakes

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.640
and the failings of social media companies,

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:25.480
but at the same time, they're revealing the division.

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:26.720
It's not like they're creating it,

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:29.160
they're revealing it in part.

01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:30.680
And so that puts a lot of,

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.080
that puts the responsibility into the hands of social media

01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:38.640
and the opportunity in the hands of social media

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.880
to alleviate some of that division.

01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:44.680
So it could in the long arc of human history result,

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:48.840
so bringing some of those divisions and the anger

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.840
and the hatred to the surface

01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:52.680
so that we can talk about it.

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.800
And as opposed to disproportionately promoting it,

01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:57.880
actually just surfacing it so we can get over.

01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:00.360
Well, you're assuming that the fat cats

02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:02.800
are more public spirited than the politicians

02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:04.480
and I'm not sure about that.

02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:06.800
I think there's a lot of money to be made

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:10.000
in being publicly spirited.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.320
I think there's a lot of money to be made

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:14.640
in increasing the amount of love in the world,

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:17.120
despite the sort of public perception

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:20.560
that all the social media companies

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:22.920
as they're interested in doing is making money.

02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.400
I think that may be true,

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:30.560
but I just personally believe people being happy

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:34.440
is a hell of a good business model.

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.800
And so making as many people happy,

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:39.920
helping them flourish in a long-term way,

02:00:39.920 --> 02:00:41.400
that's a lot of way to make people,

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:42.440
that's a good way to make money.

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:45.440
Well, I think on the other hand I think guilt and shame

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:48.080
are good motives to make you behave better in future.

02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:50.040
That's my experience.

02:00:51.680 --> 02:00:53.720
From maybe in the political perspective,

02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:55.520
certainly is the case.

02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:58.600
But it does make sense now that we can destroy ourselves

02:00:58.600 --> 02:01:03.240
with nuclear weapons, with engineered pandemics and so on,

02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:05.800
that the aliens would show up.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:09.400
That if I was the,

02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:15.200
had a leadership position maybe as a scientist

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:18.480
or otherwise in an alien civilization,

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:20.880
and I would come upon Earth,

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:24.040
I would try to watch from a distance,

02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:27.400
do not interfere.

02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.000
And I would start interfering

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:34.000
when these life forms start becoming quite,

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.960
have the capacity to be destructive.

02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:39.760
And so, I mean, it is an interesting question

02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:41.480
when people talk about UFO sightings

02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:44.760
and all those kinds of things that at least-

02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:46.760
Benign aliens you're thinking of.

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:47.760
Benign, yes.

02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:52.240
I mean, benign, almost curious, almost.

02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:56.480
Partially, as with all curiosity,

02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:58.600
partially selfish to try to observe

02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:00.080
is there something interesting

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.600
about this particular evolutionary system?

02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:07.320
Because I'm sure even to aliens, Earth is a curiosity.

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.920
Yeah, waiting is very special stage.

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:12.320
You know what I mean?

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:13.160
Perhaps very short.

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:14.680
This century is very special

02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:16.920
among the 45 million centuries

02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:18.200
the Earth experienced already.

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:19.800
So it is a very special time

02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:21.600
where they should be especially interested.

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:26.120
But I think going back to the politics,

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:29.600
the other problem is getting people

02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:33.200
who have short-term concerns to care about the long-term.

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.640
By the long-term, I now mean just looking

02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:38.520
30 years or so ahead.

02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:41.040
I know people who've been scientific advisors

02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:42.120
to governments and things,

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.440
they may make these points,

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.960
but of course they don't have much traction

02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:48.240
because as we know very well,

02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:50.840
any politician has an urgent agenda

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:52.560
of very worrying things to deal with.

02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:57.280
And so they aren't going to prioritize these issues

02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:00.760
which are longer term and less immediate

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.680
and don't just concern their constituents,

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:04.760
it may concern distant parts of the world.

02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:09.760
And so I think what we have to do is to

02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:17.080
enlist charismatic individuals to convert the public.

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:20.080
Because if the politicians know the public care

02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.760
about something, climate change as an example,

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.000
then they will make decisions

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.560
which take cognizance of that.

02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:34.040
And I think for that to happen,

02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:38.200
then we do need some public individuals

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.400
who are respected by everyone

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:42.680
and to have a high profile.

02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:45.120
And in the climate context,

02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:49.720
I would say that I've mentioned four very disparate people

02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:52.160
who've had such a big effect in the last few years.

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:55.480
One is Pope Francis, the other is David Attenborough,

02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:58.640
the other is Bill Gates and the other is Greta Thornburg.

02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:01.720
And those four people have certainly had a big shift

02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:06.720
in public opinion and even changed the rhetoric of business

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:09.600
although how deep that is, I don't know.

02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:14.760
And so, but politicians can't let these issues

02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:20.320
drop down off the agenda if there's a public clamor.

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:21.720
And it needs people like that

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.280
to keep the public clamor going.

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:24.440
To push back a little bit.

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.280
So those four are very interesting

02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.400
and I have deep respect for them.

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:31.680
They have, except David Attenborough,

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:34.240
David Attenborough is really, I mean, everybody loves him.

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.880
I mean, I can't say anything,

02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:38.840
but with Bill Gates and Greta,

02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:41.280
that also has created a lot of division.

02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:42.120
Oh sure, yeah.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:43.480
And this is a big problem.

02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:45.440
So it's not just charismatic.

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:47.200
I put that responsibility actually

02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:49.160
on the scientific community and-

02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.560
Pope does too, yeah.

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.800
Yep, and the politicians.

02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:57.800
So we need the charismatic leaders and they're rare.

02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:01.600
When you look at human history,

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:03.400
those are the ones that make a difference.

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:07.880
Those are the ones that not deride,

02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:13.240
they inspire the populace to think long-term.

02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:17.480
The JFK will go to the moon in this decade,

02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:20.520
not because it's easy, but because it is hard.

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:25.520
There's no discussion about like short-term political gains

02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:29.760
or any of that kind of stuff

02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:32.480
in the vision of going to the moon.

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:36.960
Or going to Mars or taking on gigantic projects

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.800
or taking on world hunger or taking on climate change

02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:41.920
or the education system,

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:44.680
all those things that require long-term

02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:47.720
significant investment, that requires-

02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:49.600
But it's hard to find those people.

02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:52.160
And incidentally, I think another problem,

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:54.560
which is a downside of social media,

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:58.200
is that of younger people I know,

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:03.080
the number who would contemplate a political career

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:06.560
has gone down because of the pressures on them

02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:09.200
and their family from social media.

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:10.760
It's a hell of a job now.

02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:13.560
And so I think we are all losers

02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:17.200
because the quality of people who choose that path

02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:21.960
is really dropping.

02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:24.320
And as we see by the quality of those

02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:25.560
who are in these compositions.

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:28.840
That said, I think the silver lining there

02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:33.760
is the quality of the competition actually is inspiring

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:38.760
because it shows to you that there's a dire need of leaders,

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.880
which I think would be inspiring to young people

02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:42.680
to step into the fold.

02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:44.280
I mean, great leaders are not afraid

02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:48.760
of a little bit of fire on social media.

02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:52.560
So if you have a 20-year-old kid now, a 25-year-old kid,

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:56.320
it's seeing how the world has responded to the pandemic,

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:59.400
seeing the geopolitical division over the war in Ukraine,

02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:02.880
seeing the brewing war between the West and China,

02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:05.560
we need great leaders and there's a hunger for them.

02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:09.080
And the time will come when they step up.

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:11.960
I believe that.

02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:14.520
But also to add to your list of four,

02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:15.960
he doesn't get enough credit.

02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:17.720
I've been defending him in this conversation.

02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:21.120
Elon Musk, in terms of the fight in climate change,

02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:24.440
but he also has led to a lot of division.

02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:27.800
But we need more David Annenbergs.

02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:29.320
No, no, I mean, I'm a fan.

02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:31.200
Definitely.

02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:34.440
I've heard him described as a 21st century Brunel

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:36.400
for his innovation and that's true.

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:41.400
But whether he's an ethical inspiration, I don't know.

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:44.400
Yeah, he has a lot of fun on Twitter.

02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:49.400
Well, let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat.

02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:53.560
What advice would you give to young people today?

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:56.360
Maybe they're teenagers in high school,

02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:58.320
maybe early college.

02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:03.160
What advice would you give to a career

02:08:03.160 --> 02:08:05.480
or have a life they can be proud of?

02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:08.880
Yes, well, I'd be very diffident really

02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:11.080
about offering any wisdom,

02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:16.080
but I think they should realize

02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:21.360
that the choices they make at that time are important.

02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:24.360
At that time are important.

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:29.360
And from experience I've had with many friends,

02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:32.880
many people don't realize that opportunities are open

02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:34.760
until it's too late.

02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:36.360
They somehow think that some opportunities

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:38.600
are only open to a few privileged people

02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:42.280
and they don't even try and that they could succeed.

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:47.280
But if I focus on people working in some profession

02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:52.520
I know about like science, I would say,

02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:56.320
pick an area to work in where new things are happening,

02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:00.360
where you can do something

02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:03.320
that the old guys never had a chance to think about.

02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:05.880
Don't go into a field that's fairly stagnant

02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:08.680
because then there's not much to do

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:10.640
or you'll be trying to tackle the problems

02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:12.160
that the old guys got stuck on.

02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:14.280
And so I think in science,

02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:16.080
I can give people good advice

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:19.040
that they should pick a subject

02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.560
where there are exciting new developments.

02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:24.720
And also, of course, something which suits their style

02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:28.000
because even within science, which is just one profession,

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.200
there's a big range of style

02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:31.200
between the sort of solitary thinker,

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:32.440
the person who does field work,

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:35.160
the person who works in a big team, et cetera,

02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:36.440
and whether you like computing

02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:39.000
or mathematical thought, et cetera.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.920
So pick some subject that suits your style

02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:45.160
and where things are happening fast.

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.520
And be prepared to be flexible.

02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:48.840
That's what I'd say, really.

02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:51.320
Keep your eyes open for the opportunity throughout,

02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:52.280
like you said.

02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:53.400
Go to a new field.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:56.040
Go to a field where new, cool stuff is happening.

02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:56.880
Yeah, yeah.

02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:57.720
Just keep your eyes open.

02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:58.560
Yes, that's platitudinous,

02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:02.000
but I think most of us, and I include myself in this,

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.520
didn't realize these sort of things are too late.

02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:09.440
Yeah, I think this applies way beyond science.

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:14.920
What do you make of this finite-ness of our life?

02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:16.520
Do you think about death?

02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.000
Do you think about mortality?

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.760
Do you think about your mortality?

02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:21.480
And are you afraid of death?

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.760
Well, I mean, I'm not afraid

02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:24.960
because I think I'm lucky.

02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:28.000
I feel lucky to have laughed as long as I have

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.000
and to have been fairly lucky in my life in many respects

02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:35.120
compared to most people.

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.080
So I feel very fortunate.

02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:43.040
This reminds me of this current emphasis

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:45.200
on living much longer,

02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:48.040
the so-called Altos Laboratories,

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:50.760
which have been set up by billionaires.

02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.720
There's one in San Francisco, one in La Jolla, I think,

02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:58.560
and one in Cambridge.

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:02.440
And they're funded by these guys

02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:04.720
who when young wanted to be rich,

02:11:04.720 --> 02:11:07.000
and now they're rich, they want to be young again.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.640
They won't find that quite so easy.

02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:09.920
And do we want this?

02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:10.760
I don't know.

02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:13.440
If there was some elite

02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:15.800
that was able to live much longer than others,

02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:18.840
that would be a really fundamental kind of inequality.

02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:23.840
And I think if it happened to everyone,

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:25.960
then that might be an improvement.

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:27.600
It's not so obvious.

02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:32.600
But I think for my part,

02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:36.760
I think to have lived as long as most people

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:38.160
and had a fortunate life

02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:41.640
is all I can expect a lot to be grateful for.

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:44.800
Those are all patitudes.

02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:47.720
Well, I am incredibly honored

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:49.280
that you sit down with me today.

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:51.800
I thank you so much for life

02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:55.280
of exploring some of the deepest mysteries of our universe

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:58.280
and of our humanity and thinking about our future

02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:00.680
with existential risks that are before us.

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:04.600
It's a huge honor, Martin, that you sit with me.

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:06.720
And I've really enjoyed it.

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:08.040
Well, thank you, Lex.

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:10.760
I thought we couldn't go on for as long as this,

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:12.600
but we could have gone much longer, I think.

02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:13.440
Exactly.

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:14.640
Thank you so much.

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:16.160
Thank you for listening to this conversation

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:17.320
with Martin Rees.

02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:18.520
To support this podcast,

02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:21.200
please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:23.000
And now let me leave you with some words

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.960
for Martin Rees himself.

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:27.040
I'd like to widen people's awareness

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.880
of the tremendous time span lying ahead for our planet

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.760
and for life itself.

02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:35.120
Most educated people are aware

02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:37.960
that we're the outcome of nearly 4 billion years

02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:39.880
of Darwinian selection,

02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:42.480
but many tend to think that humans

02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:45.000
are somehow the culmination.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.840
Our sun, however, is less than halfway through its lifespan.

02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:53.000
It will not be humans who watch the sun's demise

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.360
6 billion years from now.

02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:59.440
Any creatures that then exist will be as different from us

02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.000
as we are from bacteria or amoeba.

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:05.880
Thank you for listening.

02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:07.320
I hope to see you next time.

02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:08.800
Thank you.
