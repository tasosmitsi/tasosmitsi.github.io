00:00.000 --> 00:03.880
Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.560
And if you gaze into the abyss,

00:05.560 --> 00:08.320
the abyss gazes also into you.

00:08.320 --> 00:12.220
Right, but I would say, bring it on.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.280
If you gaze into the abyss long enough,

00:15.280 --> 00:17.240
you see the light, not the darkness.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.220
Are you sure about that?

00:20.220 --> 00:21.680
I'm betting my life on it.

00:24.340 --> 00:27.240
The following is a conversation with Jordan Peterson,

00:27.240 --> 00:29.740
an influential psychologist, lecturer,

00:29.780 --> 00:33.340
podcast host, and author of Maps of Meaning,

00:33.340 --> 00:37.780
12 Rules for Life, and Beyond Order.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.700
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.700
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:41.700 --> 00:43.020
in the description.

00:43.020 --> 00:47.000
And now, dear friends, here's Jordan Peterson.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.500
Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot,

00:50.500 --> 00:52.940
spoken through the character of Prince Michigan,

00:52.940 --> 00:55.140
that beauty will save the world.

00:55.140 --> 00:58.860
Solzhenitsyn actually mentioned this in his Nobel Prize

00:58.900 --> 01:00.260
acceptance speech.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.500
What do you think Dostoevsky meant by that?

01:02.500 --> 01:04.160
Was he right?

01:04.160 --> 01:05.000
Well,

01:07.840 --> 01:10.780
I guess it's the divine that saves the world, let's say.

01:10.780 --> 01:13.180
You could say that by definition.

01:13.180 --> 01:15.540
And then you might say, well,

01:15.540 --> 01:18.340
are there pointers to that which will save the world

01:18.340 --> 01:20.180
or that which eternally saves the world?

01:20.180 --> 01:23.380
And the answer to that, in all likelihood, is yes.

01:23.380 --> 01:27.660
And that's maybe truth and love and justice

01:27.660 --> 01:30.300
and the classical virtues.

01:30.300 --> 01:34.660
Beauty, perhaps, in some sense, foremost among them.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.660
That's a difficult case to make, but definitely a pointer.

01:37.660 --> 01:39.500
Which direction is the arrow pointing?

01:39.500 --> 01:40.700
Well, the arrow's pointing up.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.300
No, I think that which it points to

01:43.300 --> 01:45.020
is what beauty points to.

01:45.020 --> 01:46.420
It transcends beauty.

01:46.420 --> 01:47.540
It's more than beauty.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.420
And that speaks to the divine.

01:49.420 --> 01:51.260
It points to the divine.

01:51.260 --> 01:53.300
Yeah, and I would say, again, by definition,

01:53.300 --> 01:56.500
because we could define the divine in some real sense.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.420
So one way of defining the divine is,

01:59.420 --> 02:03.500
what is divine to you is your most fundamental axiom.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.060
And you might say, well, I don't have a fundamental axiom.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.300
Then I would say, that's fine,

02:07.300 --> 02:09.660
but then you're just confused

02:09.660 --> 02:11.980
because you have a bunch of contradictory axioms.

02:11.980 --> 02:14.060
And you might say, well, I have no axioms at all.

02:14.060 --> 02:14.900
And then I'd say, well,

02:14.900 --> 02:16.660
you're just epistemologically ignorant

02:16.660 --> 02:19.060
beyond comprehension, if you think that,

02:19.060 --> 02:20.660
because that's just not true at all.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.420
So do you don't think a human being can exist

02:22.420 --> 02:24.180
within contradictions?

02:24.180 --> 02:26.320
Well, yeah, we have to exist within contradiction,

02:27.160 --> 02:29.840
but when the contradictions make themselves manifest,

02:29.840 --> 02:33.040
say in confusion with regard to direction,

02:33.040 --> 02:37.760
then the consequence of that technically is anxiety

02:37.760 --> 02:39.400
and frustration and disappointment

02:39.400 --> 02:41.080
and all sorts of other negative emotions.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.200
But the cardinal negative emotion signifying

02:45.200 --> 02:48.880
multiple pathways forward is anxiety.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.120
It's an entropy signal.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.960
But you don't think that kind of entropy signal

02:53.960 --> 02:58.540
can be channeled into beauty, into love.

02:58.540 --> 03:03.540
Why does beauty and love have to be clear, ordered, simple?

03:04.500 --> 03:08.740
Well, I would say it probably doesn't have to be,

03:09.600 --> 03:12.480
it can't be reduced to clarity and simplicity

03:13.680 --> 03:15.920
because when it's optimally structured,

03:15.920 --> 03:20.880
it's a balance between order and chaos, not order itself.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.320
If it's too ordered, if music is too ordered,

03:24.160 --> 03:25.200
it's not acceptable.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.560
It sounds like a drum machine.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.760
It's too repetitive.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.580
It's too predictable.

03:29.580 --> 03:34.400
It has to have, well, it has to have some fire in it

03:34.400 --> 03:36.060
along with the structure.

03:36.060 --> 03:40.780
I was in Miami doing a seminar on Exodus

03:40.780 --> 03:42.220
with a number of scholars,

03:42.220 --> 03:45.900
and this is a beauty discussion.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.420
When Moses first encounters the burning bush,

03:49.440 --> 03:52.440
it's not a conflagration that demands attention.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.600
It's something that catches his attention.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.000
It's a phenomena and that means to shine forth

03:58.000 --> 04:01.280
and Moses has to stop and attend to it and he does.

04:01.280 --> 04:05.580
And he sees this fire that doesn't consume the tree.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.760
And the tree, the tree is a structure, right?

04:07.760 --> 04:09.040
It's a tree-like structure.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.160
It's a branching structure.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.080
It's a hierarchical structure.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.020
It's a self-similar structure.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.040
It's a fractal structure.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.180
And it's the tree of life

04:17.180 --> 04:19.040
and it's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

04:19.040 --> 04:23.060
And the fire in it is the transformation

04:23.060 --> 04:25.360
that's always occurring within every structure.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.560
And the fact that the fire doesn't consume the bush

04:28.560 --> 04:32.400
in that representation is an indication

04:32.400 --> 04:34.840
of the balance of transformation with structure.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.800
And that balance is presented as God

04:37.800 --> 04:42.320
and what attracts Moses to it in some sense is the beauty.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.820
Now it's the novelty and all that,

04:43.820 --> 04:46.480
but like a painting is like a burning bush.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.760
That's a good way of thinking about it, a great painting.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.760
It's too much for people often.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.080
You know, my house was and will soon be again,

04:55.080 --> 04:58.200
completely covered with paintings inside.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.800
And it was hard on people to come in there

05:01.800 --> 05:04.560
because while my mother, for example, say,

05:04.560 --> 05:07.080
well, why would you want to live in a museum?

05:07.080 --> 05:09.200
And I'd think, well, I would rather live in a museum

05:09.200 --> 05:10.840
than anywhere else in some real sense,

05:10.840 --> 05:13.240
but beauty is daunting.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.080
It scares people.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.200
They're terrified of buying art, for example,

05:17.200 --> 05:18.720
because their taste is on display.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.520
And they should be terrified

05:20.520 --> 05:22.280
because generally people have terrible taste.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.480
Now that doesn't mean they shouldn't foster it

05:24.480 --> 05:26.360
and develop it, but, and you know,

05:26.360 --> 05:28.400
when you put your taste on display,

05:28.400 --> 05:30.680
it's a real, really exposes you.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.560
Even to yourself as you walk past it every day.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.000
Absolutely. This is who I am.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.320
Yeah, well, and look how mundane that is

05:38.320 --> 05:41.360
and look how trite it is and look at how cliched it is

05:41.360 --> 05:45.120
and look at how sterile or too ordered it is or too chaotic.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.120
Or how quickly you start to take it for granted

05:47.120 --> 05:48.600
because you've seen it so many times.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.560
Well, if it's a real piece of art, that doesn't happen.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.400
You notice the little details.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.720
The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.640
I mean, there are images, religious images in particular,

05:59.640 --> 06:02.120
so we could call them deep images

06:02.120 --> 06:07.040
that people have been unpacking for 4,000 years

06:07.040 --> 06:09.200
and still haven't, I'll give you an example.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.760
This is a terrible example.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.840
So I did a lecture series on Genesis

06:15.840 --> 06:18.040
and I got a lot of it unpacked,

06:18.040 --> 06:19.600
but by no means all of it.

06:21.400 --> 06:25.120
When God kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden,

06:25.120 --> 06:28.360
he puts cherubim with flaming swords at the gate

06:28.360 --> 06:31.880
to stop human beings from reentering paradise.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.560
I thought, what the hell does that mean?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.720
Cherubim, and why do they have flaming swords?

06:35.720 --> 06:36.560
I don't get that.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.720
What is that exactly?

06:38.720 --> 06:41.240
And then I found out from Matthew Pagel,

06:41.240 --> 06:44.160
who wrote a great book on symbolism in Genesis,

06:44.200 --> 06:48.120
that cherubim are the supporting monsters of God.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.120
It's a very complicated idea.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.040
And that they're partly a representation

06:53.040 --> 06:57.120
of that which is difficult to fit into conceptual systems.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.000
They've also got an angelic or demonic aspect.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.280
Take your pick.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.280
Why do they have flaming swords?

07:04.280 --> 07:07.600
Well, a sword is a symbol of judgment

07:07.600 --> 07:12.600
and the separation of the wheat from the chaff.

07:13.280 --> 07:18.280
Use a sword to cut away, to cut away and to carve.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.120
And a flaming sword is not only that which carves,

07:21.120 --> 07:23.120
it's that which burns.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.640
And what does it carve away and burn?

07:25.640 --> 07:27.400
Well, you wanna get into paradise?

07:28.320 --> 07:32.440
It carves away everything about you that isn't perfect.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.000
And so what does that mean?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.640
Okay, well, here's part of what it means.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.680
This is a terrible thing.

07:37.680 --> 07:41.000
So you could say that the entire Christian narrative

07:41.000 --> 07:42.720
is embedded in that image.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.960
Why?

07:44.960 --> 07:48.520
Well, let's say that flaming swords are a symbol of death.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.720
That seems pretty obvious.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.840
Let's say further that they're a symbol of apocalypse

07:54.840 --> 07:55.680
and hell.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.520
That doesn't seem completely unreasonable.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.840
So here's an idea.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.720
Not only do you have to face death,

08:04.720 --> 08:06.960
you have to face death and hell

08:06.960 --> 08:09.120
before you can get to paradise.

08:09.120 --> 08:13.480
Hellish judgment and all that's embedded in that image.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.560
And a piece of art with an image like that

08:16.560 --> 08:18.760
has all that information in it.

08:18.760 --> 08:22.600
And it shines forth in some fundamental sense.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.600
It reaches into the back tendrils of your mind

08:25.600 --> 08:29.520
at levels you can't even comprehend and grips you.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.400
I mean, that's why people go to museums

08:31.400 --> 08:33.840
and gaze at paintings they don't understand.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.320
And that's why they'll pay

08:35.320 --> 08:37.680
what's the most expensive objects in the world.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.720
If it's not carbon fiber racing yachts,

08:39.720 --> 08:42.880
it's definitely classic paintings, right?

08:42.880 --> 08:45.720
It's high level technological implements

08:45.720 --> 08:47.080
or it's classic art.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.920
Well, why are those things so expensive?

08:48.920 --> 08:51.840
Why do we build temples to house the images?

08:51.840 --> 08:54.600
Even secular people go to museums.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.760
I'm secular.

08:55.760 --> 08:56.960
Well, are you in a museum?

08:56.960 --> 08:57.800
Yes.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.640
Are you looking at art?

08:58.640 --> 08:59.460
Yes.

08:59.460 --> 09:03.800
Well, what makes you think you're secular then?

09:03.800 --> 09:07.440
It's arguable that the thing many, many centuries from now

09:08.200 --> 09:11.720
that will remain of all of human civilization will be our art.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.000
Not even the words.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.360
Well, you know, a book has remained a very long time,

09:16.360 --> 09:17.200
right?

09:17.200 --> 09:18.020
The biblical writings.

09:18.020 --> 09:18.860
Not that long.

09:18.860 --> 09:19.700
No.

09:19.700 --> 09:20.520
A few millennia.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.360
That's right.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.400
But that's in the full arc of living organisms

09:24.400 --> 09:25.240
perhaps will not be.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.360
Well, we have images that are,

09:27.360 --> 09:30.720
we have artistic images that are at least 50,000 years old,

09:30.720 --> 09:31.560
right?

09:31.560 --> 09:32.400
That have survived.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.440
And some of those are,

09:34.440 --> 09:36.800
they're already profound in their symbolism.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.280
Do you mean humans?

09:38.280 --> 09:43.280
Yeah, we found them and they've lasted that long.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.120
And so, and then think about Europe.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.760
Secular people all over the world

09:49.760 --> 09:51.880
make pilgrimages to Europe.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.360
Well, why?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.160
Because of the beauty.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.000
Obviously.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.720
I mean, that's self-evident.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.200
And it's partly because there are things in Europe

10:01.200 --> 10:02.040
that are so beautiful.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.320
They take your breath away, right?

10:03.320 --> 10:04.580
They make your hair stand on end.

10:04.580 --> 10:06.640
They fill you with a sense of awe.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.360
And we need to see those things.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.440
It's not optional.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.040
We need to see those things.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.160
The cathedrals.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.520
I was in a cathedral in Vienna

10:15.520 --> 10:17.760
and it was terribly beautiful, you know?

10:17.760 --> 10:18.600
Terribly beautiful.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.040
Well, it was terribly beautiful.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.600
Is beauty painful for you?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.280
Is that the highest form of beauty

10:24.280 --> 10:25.640
that really challenges you?

10:25.640 --> 10:27.040
Oh, definitely.

10:27.040 --> 10:27.880
Yeah, yeah.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.920
I got a good analysis of the statue of David,

10:29.920 --> 10:31.360
Michelangelo's statue says,

10:31.360 --> 10:34.000
you could be far more than you are.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.960
That's what that statue says.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.640
And this cathedral, you know,

10:37.640 --> 10:41.120
we went down into the under structure of it

10:41.120 --> 10:46.120
and there were three floors of bones from the plague

10:46.280 --> 10:47.600
and there they all are.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.160
And then that cathedral's on top of it.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.560
It's no joke to go visit a place like that.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.400
No, it rattles you to the core.

10:56.400 --> 11:01.400
And our religious systems have become propositionally dubious

11:03.400 --> 11:05.360
but there's no arguing with the architecture,

11:05.360 --> 11:07.480
although modern architects like to,

11:07.480 --> 11:10.200
with their sterility and their giant middle fingers

11:10.200 --> 11:11.440
erected everywhere.

11:12.360 --> 11:16.720
But beauty is a terrible pointer to God.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.360
And you know, a secular person will say,

11:18.360 --> 11:19.480
well, I don't believe in God.

11:19.480 --> 11:22.120
It's like, have it your way.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.080
You cannot move forward

11:25.080 --> 11:27.920
into the unforeseen horizon of the future,

11:27.920 --> 11:29.880
except on faith.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.400
And you might say, well, I have no faith.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.280
It's like, well, good luck with the future then

11:33.280 --> 11:36.280
because what are you then nihilistic and hopeless

11:36.280 --> 11:38.360
and anxiety-ridden?

11:38.360 --> 11:41.080
And if not, well, something's guiding you forward.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.600
It's faith in something or multiple things

11:43.600 --> 11:45.960
which just makes you a polytheist,

11:45.960 --> 11:48.160
which I wouldn't recommend.

11:48.160 --> 11:53.160
Well, let me ask you one short-lived biological meat bag

11:53.160 --> 11:54.800
to another.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.680
Who is God then?

11:58.120 --> 12:00.280
Let's try to sneak up to this question

12:00.280 --> 12:01.600
if it's at all possible.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.040
Is it possible to even talk about this?

12:05.040 --> 12:06.480
Well, it better be because otherwise

12:06.480 --> 12:09.000
there's no communicating about it, right?

12:09.000 --> 12:12.360
It has to be something that can be brought down to earth.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.720
Well, we might be too dumb to bring it down.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.000
It's not just ignorant.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.720
It's also sinful, right?

12:18.720 --> 12:20.560
So because there's not knowing

12:20.560 --> 12:23.960
and then there's wanting to know or refusing to know.

12:23.960 --> 12:24.800
Yeah.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.800
And so you might say, well, could you extract God

12:27.800 --> 12:30.880
from a description of the objective world, right?

12:30.880 --> 12:35.880
Is God just the ultimate unity of the natural reality?

12:36.960 --> 12:39.320
And I would say, well, in a sense,

12:39.320 --> 12:41.720
there's some truth in that, but not exactly

12:41.720 --> 12:45.080
because God in the highest sense is the spirit

12:45.080 --> 12:49.040
that you must emulate in order to thrive.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.440
How's that for a biological definition?

12:51.440 --> 12:53.440
Spirit is a pattern.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.120
The spirit that you must emulate in order to thrive.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.280
So it's a kind of, in one sense,

12:59.280 --> 13:02.600
when we say the human spirit, it's that.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.360
It's an animating principle.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.840
Yeah, it's a meta, it's a pattern.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.640
And you might say, well, what's the pattern?

13:08.640 --> 13:11.320
Okay, well, I can tell you that to some degree.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.840
Imagine that like you're gripped by beauty,

13:14.840 --> 13:17.200
you're gripped by admiration.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.000
So, and you can just notice this.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.320
This isn't propositional.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.640
You have to notice it.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.720
It's like, oh, turns out I admire that person.

13:25.720 --> 13:26.960
Hmm.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.160
So what does that mean?

13:28.160 --> 13:31.920
Well, it means I would like to be like him or her.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.960
That's what admiration means.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.960
It means there's something about the way they are

13:35.960 --> 13:40.080
that compels imitation, another instinct,

13:40.080 --> 13:44.600
or inspires respect or awe even.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.840
Okay, what is that that grips you?

13:46.840 --> 13:49.320
Well, I don't know.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.040
Well, let's say, okay, fine, but it grips you

13:52.040 --> 13:53.400
and you want to be like that.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.240
Kids hero worship, for example,

13:55.240 --> 13:56.600
and so do adults for that matter,

13:56.600 --> 13:58.160
unless they become entirely cynical.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.400
I worship quite a few heroes.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.240
Well, there you go.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.080
Proudly.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.360
Yes, well, there you go.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.880
And there's no, that worship,

14:04.880 --> 14:08.480
that celebration and proclivity to imitate is worship.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.160
That's what worship means most fundamentally.

14:11.160 --> 14:15.160
Now imagine you took the set of all admirable people

14:16.040 --> 14:18.960
and you extracted out AI learning.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.960
You extracted out the central features

14:20.960 --> 14:23.240
of what constitutes admirable.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.960
And then you did that repeatedly until you purified it

14:25.960 --> 14:27.680
to what was most admirable.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.600
That's as good as you're gonna get

14:31.600 --> 14:36.160
in terms of a representation of God.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.640
And you might say, well, I don't believe in that.

14:37.640 --> 14:40.320
It's like, well, what do you mean?

14:40.320 --> 14:41.160
Yeah.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.880
It's not a set of propositional facts.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.560
It's not a scientific theory

14:45.560 --> 14:47.400
about the structure of the objective world.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.120
And then I could say something about that too,

14:49.120 --> 14:50.640
because I've been thinking about this a lot,

14:50.640 --> 14:53.360
especially since talking to Richard Dawkins.

14:53.360 --> 14:57.360
It's like, okay, the post-modernist types,

14:57.360 --> 14:59.680
going back way before Derrida and Foucault,

14:59.680 --> 15:01.720
maybe back to Nietzsche,

15:01.720 --> 15:05.640
who I admire greatly by the way, says, God is dead.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.360
It's like, okay, but Nietzsche said, God is dead

15:09.360 --> 15:11.480
and we have killed him and we'll not find enough water

15:11.480 --> 15:12.960
to wash away all the blood.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.160
So that was Nietzsche.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.120
He's no fool.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.120
He's got a way with words.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.680
He certainly does.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.040
And so then you think, okay, well, we killed the transcendent.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.680
Well, what does that mean for science?

15:24.680 --> 15:27.560
Well, it frees it up because all that nonsense

15:27.560 --> 15:30.400
about a deity is just the idiot superstition

15:30.400 --> 15:35.400
that stops the scientific process from moving forward.

15:35.480 --> 15:38.560
That's basically the new atheist claim, something like that.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.000
It's like, wait a second.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.440
Do you believe in the transcendent if you're a scientist?

15:44.440 --> 15:47.840
And the answer is, well, not only do you believe in it,

15:47.840 --> 15:49.480
you believe in it more than anything else,

15:49.480 --> 15:51.680
because if you're a scientist,

15:51.680 --> 15:56.160
you believe in what objects to your theory

15:56.160 --> 15:58.400
more than you believe in your theory.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.400
Now, we got to think that through very carefully.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.920
So your theory describes the world

16:01.920 --> 16:04.160
and as far as you're concerned,

16:04.160 --> 16:07.200
your description of the world is the world.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.600
But because you're a scientist, you think, well,

16:09.600 --> 16:11.920
even though that's my description of the world

16:11.920 --> 16:13.760
and that's what I believe,

16:13.760 --> 16:15.960
there's something beyond what I believe

16:17.040 --> 16:18.040
and that's the object.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.320
And so I'm gonna throw my theory against the object

16:20.320 --> 16:21.720
and see where it'll break.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.320
And then I'm going to use the evidence of the break

16:25.320 --> 16:28.760
as a source of new information to revitalize my theory.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.400
So as a scientist, you have to posit the existence

16:31.400 --> 16:33.840
of the ontological transcendent

16:33.840 --> 16:37.240
before you can move forward at all, but more.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.560
You have to posit that contact

16:40.560 --> 16:43.040
with the ontological transcendent,

16:43.040 --> 16:46.400
annoying though it is because it upsets your apple cart,

16:46.400 --> 16:49.720
is exactly what will in fact set you free.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.360
So then you accept the proposition

16:51.360 --> 16:53.440
that there is a transcendent reality

16:54.440 --> 16:58.440
and that contact with that transcendent reality

16:58.440 --> 17:00.960
is redemptive in the most fundamental sense,

17:00.960 --> 17:01.800
because if it wasn't,

17:01.800 --> 17:03.800
well, why would you bother making contact with it?

17:03.800 --> 17:06.240
You're gonna make everything worse or better.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.000
Why does the contact with the transcendent

17:10.000 --> 17:11.760
set you free as a scientist?

17:11.760 --> 17:13.840
Because you assume that, you assume,

17:13.840 --> 17:15.880
I mean, freedom in the most fundamental sense.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.920
It's like, well, freedom from want,

17:17.920 --> 17:21.000
freedom from disease, freedom from ignorance, right?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.400
That it informs you.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.840
So it's the eye of science. The logos in it.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.400
It is definitely that.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.720
Yeah, it's the direction,

17:29.720 --> 17:31.440
let's say the directionality of science.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.120
That's a narrative direction, not a scientific direction.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.440
And then the question is, what is the narrative?

17:36.440 --> 17:38.800
Well, it posits a transcendent reality.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.640
It posits that the transcendent reality is corrective.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.480
It posits that our knowledge structure

17:43.480 --> 17:45.960
should be regarded with humility.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.200
It posits that you should bow down

17:48.200 --> 17:51.760
in the face of the transcendent evidence.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.240
And you have to take a vow.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.480
You know this as a scientist,

17:54.480 --> 17:56.440
you have to take a vow to follow that path

17:56.440 --> 17:57.720
if you're gonna be a real scientist.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.400
It's like the truth, no matter what.

18:01.400 --> 18:05.160
And that means you posit the truth as a redemptive force.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.400
Well, what does redemptive mean?

18:06.400 --> 18:07.720
Well, why bother with science?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.160
Well, so people don't starve.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.240
So people can move about more effectively.

18:11.240 --> 18:13.000
So life can be more abundant, right?

18:13.040 --> 18:16.720
So it's all ensconced within an underlying ethic.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.080
So the reason I was saying that

18:19.080 --> 18:20.760
while we were talking about belief in God,

18:20.760 --> 18:23.240
it's like, this is a very complicated topic, right?

18:23.240 --> 18:25.040
Do you believe in a transcendent reality?

18:25.040 --> 18:28.560
See, okay, now let's say you buy the argument

18:28.560 --> 18:30.040
I just made on the natural front.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.360
You say, yeah, yeah, that's just nature.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.680
That's not God.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.600
And then I'd say, well,

18:36.600 --> 18:38.760
what makes you think you know what nature is?

18:39.760 --> 18:41.960
Like, see, the problem with that argument

18:41.960 --> 18:45.520
is that it already presumes a materialist,

18:45.520 --> 18:48.200
a reductionist materialist objective view

18:48.200 --> 18:50.200
of what constitutes nature.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.600
But if you're a scientist, you're gonna think,

18:52.600 --> 18:55.240
well, in the final analysis, I don't know what nature is.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.360
I certainly don't know its origin or destination point.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.320
I don't know its teleology.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.800
I'm really ignorant about nature.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.680
And so when I say it's nothing but nature,

19:05.680 --> 19:07.360
I shouldn't mean it's nothing

19:07.360 --> 19:10.680
but what I understand nature to be.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.560
So I could say, will we have a fully reductionist account

19:13.560 --> 19:16.280
of cognitive processes?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.640
And the answer to that is yes.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.360
But by the time we do that,

19:19.360 --> 19:22.520
our understanding of matter will have transformed so much

19:22.520 --> 19:24.520
that what we think of as reductionists now

19:24.520 --> 19:28.160
won't look anything like what we think of reductionism now.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.000
Matter isn't dead dust.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.720
I don't know what it is.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.280
I have no idea what it is.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.080
Matter is what matters.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.400
There's a definition.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.560
That's a very weird definition.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.520
But the notion that we have,

19:42.520 --> 19:44.080
you know, that if you're a reductionist,

19:44.080 --> 19:45.240
a materialist reductionist,

19:45.240 --> 19:48.800
that you can reduce the complexity of what is

19:48.800 --> 19:52.000
to your assumptions about the nature of matter.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.960
That's not a scientific proposition.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.400
Your specific limited human assumptions

19:55.400 --> 19:58.680
of this century, of this week, that.

19:58.680 --> 20:03.680
So in some sense, without God

20:03.760 --> 20:08.000
in this complicated big definition we're talking about,

20:08.960 --> 20:11.960
there's no humility or it's less.

20:11.960 --> 20:12.800
There's not enough.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.240
There's less likely to be,

20:15.240 --> 20:19.400
or rather science can err in taking a trajectory

20:19.400 --> 20:20.800
away from humility.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.640
Well.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.000
Without something much more powerful

20:24.000 --> 20:26.200
than an individual human.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.800
Yeah, well then, and we know, you know,

20:27.800 --> 20:30.520
the Frankenstein story comes out of that instantly.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.720
And that's a good story for the current times.

20:33.760 --> 20:37.920
It's like, you're playing around with making new life.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.800
You bloody well better make sure

20:40.800 --> 20:43.440
you have your arrows pointed up.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.480
And it's interesting because you said science

20:45.480 --> 20:49.440
has an ethic to it.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.280
I think.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.360
It's embedded in an ethic.

20:51.360 --> 20:55.480
Well, there's a, you know, science is a big word.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.320
Yeah.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.280
And it includes a lot of disciplines

20:57.280 --> 20:58.560
that have different traditions.

20:58.560 --> 21:02.680
So biology, chemistry, genetics, physics,

21:03.920 --> 21:06.680
those are very different communities.

21:06.680 --> 21:09.560
And I think biology, especially when you get closer

21:09.560 --> 21:12.160
and closer to medicine and to the human body,

21:12.160 --> 21:14.000
does have a very serious,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
first of all, it has a history with Nazi Germany

21:16.000 --> 21:18.280
of being abused and all those kinds of things,

21:18.280 --> 21:21.080
but it has a history of taking this stuff seriously.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.600
What doesn't have a history of taking this stuff seriously

21:23.600 --> 21:25.680
is robotics and artificial intelligence,

21:25.680 --> 21:29.800
which is really interesting because you don't,

21:29.800 --> 21:31.240
you know, you called me a scientist,

21:31.240 --> 21:34.880
but, and I would like to wear that label proudly,

21:34.880 --> 21:37.800
but often people don't think of computer science

21:37.800 --> 21:40.960
as a science, but nevertheless, it will be,

21:40.960 --> 21:44.800
I think the science of one of the major scientific fields

21:44.800 --> 21:46.280
of the 21st century.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.640
And you should take that very seriously.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.560
Oftentimes when people build robots or AI systems,

21:52.560 --> 21:57.200
they think of them as toys to tinker with.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.960
Oh, isn't this cool?

21:58.960 --> 22:00.440
Well, I feel this too.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.280
Isn't this cool?

22:01.280 --> 22:02.400
It is cool.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.840
But, you know, at a certain moment you might,

22:05.840 --> 22:09.360
isn't this nuclear explosion cool?

22:09.360 --> 22:10.400
Yeah. Because it is.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.120
Or birth control pill cool.

22:12.120 --> 22:14.920
It's like, or transistor cool.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.000
Yeah. Well, the other thing too,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.440
and this is a weird problem in some sense,

22:20.440 --> 22:24.000
robotics engineer types, they're thing people, right?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.960
I mean, the big classes of interest

22:25.960 --> 22:28.680
are interest in things versus interest in people.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.720
Some of my best friends are thing people.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.560
Yeah, right.

22:31.560 --> 22:36.560
And thing people are very, very clear, logical thinkers,

22:37.000 --> 22:41.080
and they're very outcome oriented and practical.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.240
Now, and that's all good.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.040
That makes the machinery and keeps it functioning,

22:46.040 --> 22:49.320
but there's a human side of the equation.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.520
And you get the extreme thing people,

22:52.520 --> 22:55.280
and you think, yeah, well, what about the human here?

22:55.280 --> 22:58.040
And when we're talking about,

22:58.040 --> 22:59.600
we've been talking about the necessity

22:59.600 --> 23:03.400
of having a technological enterprise embedded in an ethic.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.280
And you can ignore that, like most of the time, right?

23:06.280 --> 23:09.440
You can ignore the overall ethic in some sense

23:09.440 --> 23:11.880
when you're toying around with your toys.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.000
But when you're building an artificial intelligence,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.120
it's like, well, that's not a toy.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.480
That might be.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.200
Toy becomes the monster very quickly.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.840
Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.920
And this is a whole new kind of monster.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.560
And maybe it's already here.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.040
Yes, and you notice how many of those things

23:35.040 --> 23:36.600
you can no longer turn off.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.400
And what is it with you engineers

23:40.400 --> 23:43.400
and your inability to put off switches on things now?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.840
It's like, I have to hold this for five seconds

23:46.840 --> 23:48.920
for it to shut off, or I can't figure.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.760
I just want to shut it off, click off.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.760
Well, what is it with you humans

23:53.760 --> 23:57.040
that don't put off switches on other humans?

23:57.040 --> 23:59.560
Because there's a magic to the thing that you notice,

23:59.560 --> 24:03.400
and it hurts for both you and perhaps one day

24:03.400 --> 24:05.960
the thing itself to turn it off.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.160
And so you have to be very careful as an engineer

24:08.160 --> 24:09.960
adding off switches to things.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.400
I think it's a feature, not a bug, the off switch.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.040
The off switch gives a deadline to us humans

24:17.040 --> 24:19.640
to systems of existence.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.720
It makes you, you know,

24:21.720 --> 24:25.760
death is the thing that really brings clarity to life.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.040
And I do think-

24:27.040 --> 24:28.800
Hence the flaming swords.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.640
The flaming swords.

24:29.640 --> 24:33.320
I do like your view of the flame, the bush,

24:33.320 --> 24:36.680
and perhaps the sword as a thing of transformation.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.920
It's also, it's a transformation

24:38.920 --> 24:41.400
that kind of consumes the thing in the process.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.320
Well, it depends on how much of the thing is chaff.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.240
You know, this is why you can't touch

24:46.240 --> 24:48.680
the Ark of the Covenant, for example.

24:48.680 --> 24:52.080
And this is why people can have very bad psychedelic trips.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.960
It's like, if you're 95% dead wood

24:54.960 --> 24:57.200
and you get too close to the flame,

24:57.200 --> 25:00.640
the 5% that's left might not be able to make it.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.720
So you think it's all chaff,

25:04.720 --> 25:08.360
but I think there is some aspect of destruction that is,

25:08.360 --> 25:10.920
that's, you know, the old Bukowski line

25:10.920 --> 25:13.760
of do what you love and let it kill you.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.600
Don't you think that destruction is part of-

25:16.600 --> 25:18.200
That's humility.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.040
That's humility.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.600
You bet, you bet, you bet.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.080
It's like inviting the judgment, inviting the judgment,

25:24.080 --> 25:25.560
because maybe you can die a little bit

25:25.560 --> 25:27.040
instead of dying completely.

25:27.040 --> 25:27.880
Yeah.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.200
I think it's Alfred North Whitehead.

25:30.200 --> 25:33.360
We can let our ideas die instead of us, right?

25:33.360 --> 25:35.680
We can have these partial personalities

25:35.680 --> 25:38.560
that we can burn off and we can let them go

25:38.560 --> 25:41.000
before they become tyrannical pharaohs

25:41.000 --> 25:43.200
and we lose everything.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.360
And so, yeah, there's this optimal bite of death.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.600
And who knows what it would mean to optimize that?

25:49.600 --> 25:52.480
Like, what if it was possible that if you died enough

25:52.480 --> 25:56.160
all the time, that you could continue to live?

25:56.160 --> 25:58.280
And the thing is, we already know that biologically,

25:58.280 --> 26:02.440
because if you don't die properly all the time,

26:02.440 --> 26:07.040
well, it's cancerous outgrowths and it's a very fine balance

26:07.040 --> 26:10.800
between productivity on the biological front

26:10.800 --> 26:14.000
and the culling of that, right?

26:14.000 --> 26:17.640
Life is a real balance between growth and death.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.280
And so what would happen if you got that balance right?

26:20.280 --> 26:21.520
Well, we kind of know, right?

26:21.520 --> 26:26.040
Because if you live your life properly, so to speak,

26:26.040 --> 26:28.760
and you're humble enough to let your stupidity die

26:28.760 --> 26:32.000
before it takes you out, you will live longer.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.160
That's just a fact.

26:34.120 --> 26:37.080
Well, but then what's the ultimate extension of that?

26:37.080 --> 26:38.680
And the answer is we don't know.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.120
We have no idea.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.920
Well, let me ask you a difficult question, because-

26:42.920 --> 26:45.640
As opposed to the easy ones that you've been asking so far.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.880
Well, Dostoevsky is always just the warmup.

26:50.840 --> 26:54.640
So if death every single day is the way

26:54.640 --> 26:58.640
to progress through life, you have become quite famous.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.120
Death and hell.

27:00.120 --> 27:00.960
Death and hell.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.720
Yeah, yeah, because you don't want to forget the hell part.

27:04.680 --> 27:08.680
Do you worry that your fame traps you

27:08.680 --> 27:12.320
into the person that you were before?

27:12.320 --> 27:15.240
Yeah, well, Elvis became an Elvis impersonator

27:15.240 --> 27:16.480
by the time he died.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.240
Yeah, do you fear that you have become

27:18.240 --> 27:20.640
a Jordan Peterson impersonator?

27:20.640 --> 27:25.320
Do you fear of, in some part, becoming the famous

27:25.320 --> 27:29.240
suit-wearing, brilliant Jordan Peterson,

27:29.240 --> 27:34.240
the certainty in the pursuit of truth always right?

27:34.880 --> 27:36.920
I think I worry about it more than anything else.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.040
I hope.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.200
I hope I do.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.040
I better.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.080
Has fame, to some degree, when you look at yourself

27:43.080 --> 27:45.560
in the mirror, in the quiet of your mind,

27:45.560 --> 27:47.640
has it corrupted you?

27:47.640 --> 27:50.120
No doubt, in some regard.

27:50.120 --> 27:53.240
I mean, it's a very difficult thing to avoid, you know,

27:53.240 --> 27:57.080
because things change around you.

27:57.080 --> 28:00.280
People are much more likely to do what you ask,

28:00.280 --> 28:01.800
for example, right?

28:01.800 --> 28:04.320
And so that's a danger, because one of the things

28:04.320 --> 28:06.680
that keeps you dying properly is that people

28:06.680 --> 28:08.800
push back against you optimally.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.440
This is why so many celebrities spiral out of control,

28:11.440 --> 28:15.160
especially the tyrannical types that, say, run countries.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.360
Everyone around them stops saying,

28:17.360 --> 28:20.160
yeah, you're deviating a little bit there.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.560
They laugh at all their jokes.

28:21.560 --> 28:22.800
They open all their doors.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.320
They always want something from them.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.320
The red carpet's always rolled out.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.800
It's like, well, you think, wouldn't that be lovely?

28:29.800 --> 28:34.040
It's, well, not if the red carpet is rolled out to you

28:34.040 --> 28:36.280
while you're on your way to perdition.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.840
That's not a good deal.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.040
You just get there more efficiently.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.680
And so one of the things that I've tried to learn

28:42.680 --> 28:46.160
to manage is to have people around me all the time

28:46.160 --> 28:49.320
who are critics, who are saying,

28:49.320 --> 28:50.680
yeah, I could have done that better,

28:50.680 --> 28:52.880
and you're a little too harsh there,

28:52.880 --> 28:55.680
and you're alienating people unnecessarily there,

28:55.680 --> 28:59.000
and you should have done some more background work there.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.160
And I think the responsibility attendant upon that

29:02.160 --> 29:04.760
increases as your influence increases.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.480
And that's, as your influence increases,

29:08.480 --> 29:10.920
then that becomes a lot of responsibility.

29:12.360 --> 29:15.080
So, you know, and then maybe have an off day and,

29:15.080 --> 29:17.240
well, here's an example.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.320
I've been writing some columns lately

29:19.320 --> 29:21.240
about things that perturb me,

29:22.080 --> 29:25.560
like the forthcoming famine, for example,

29:25.560 --> 29:30.560
and it's hard to take those problems on.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.320
It's difficult to take those problems on

29:33.320 --> 29:35.520
in a serious manner, and it's frightening.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.520
And it would be easier just to go up to the cottage

29:37.520 --> 29:40.800
with my wife and go out on the lake and watch the sunset.

29:40.800 --> 29:45.800
And so I'm tempted to draw on anger as a motivating energy

29:48.120 --> 29:52.080
to help me overcome the resistance to doing this.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.640
But then that makes me more harsh and judgemental

29:54.640 --> 29:57.280
in my tone when I'm reading such things,

29:57.280 --> 30:00.280
for example, on YouTube, than might be optimal.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.320
Now I've had debates with people about that,

30:03.320 --> 30:05.240
because I have friends who say,

30:05.240 --> 30:10.240
no, if you're calling out the environmentalist globalists

30:10.520 --> 30:12.800
who are harassing the Dutch farmers,

30:12.800 --> 30:15.880
then a little anger is just the ticket.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.680
But then others say, well, you know,

30:17.680 --> 30:20.200
you don't want to be too harsh because you alienate people

30:20.200 --> 30:22.040
who would otherwise listen to you.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.920
It's like, that's a hard balance to get right.

30:24.920 --> 30:28.440
But also maybe anger hardens your mind

30:28.520 --> 30:30.560
to where you don't notice the subtle,

30:30.560 --> 30:32.600
quiet beauty of the world,

30:32.600 --> 30:34.600
the quiet love that's always there,

30:34.600 --> 30:36.200
that permeates everything.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.920
Sometimes you can become deeply cynical about the world

30:38.920 --> 30:41.880
if it's the Nietzsche thing.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.760
Battle not with monsters, lest you become a monster.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.440
And if you gaze into the abyss,

30:47.440 --> 30:50.800
the abyss gazes also into you.

30:50.800 --> 30:54.080
But I would say, bring it on.

30:54.080 --> 30:54.920
Right?

30:54.920 --> 30:56.920
Because that's why I also say,

30:56.920 --> 30:58.600
knowing that he's absolutely right.

30:58.600 --> 31:02.000
But if you gaze into the abyss long enough,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.120
you see the light, not the darkness.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.840
Are you sure about that?

31:06.840 --> 31:09.040
I'm betting my life on it.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.000
Yeah, that's a heck of a bet.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Because it might distort your mind to where all you see-

31:16.000 --> 31:16.840
Is abyss.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.920
Is abyss, is the evil in this world.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.640
Well, then I would say you haven't looked long enough.

31:22.920 --> 31:27.320
You know, that's back to the swords, the flaming swords.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.960
It's like, so I said the whole story of Christ

31:29.960 --> 31:32.120
was prefigured in that image.

31:32.120 --> 31:35.720
It's like the story of Christ psychologically

31:35.720 --> 31:39.720
is radical acceptance of the worst possible tragedy.

31:39.720 --> 31:40.560
That's what it means.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.800
That's what the crucifix means psychologically.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.600
It's like gaze upon that which you are most afraid of,

31:45.600 --> 31:47.320
but that story doesn't end there.

31:47.320 --> 31:51.840
Because in the story, Christ goes through death into hell,

31:52.840 --> 31:54.800
so death isn't enough.

31:54.800 --> 31:58.400
The abyss of innocent death is not sufficient

31:58.400 --> 32:00.200
to produce redemption.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.640
It has to be a voluntary journey to hell.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.440
And maybe that's true for everyone.

32:05.720 --> 32:08.280
And that's like, there is no more terrifying idea

32:08.280 --> 32:09.800
than that by definition.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.280
And so then, well, do you gaze upon that?

32:13.440 --> 32:17.240
Well, who knows?

32:17.240 --> 32:18.080
Who knows?

32:18.360 --> 32:22.480
How often do you gaze upon death, your own?

32:22.480 --> 32:26.080
How often do you remember, remind yourself

32:26.080 --> 32:27.480
that this ride ends?

32:27.480 --> 32:28.320
Personally?

32:28.320 --> 32:29.560
Personally.

32:29.560 --> 32:30.760
All the time.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.720
Because you, as a deep thinker and a philosopher,

32:33.720 --> 32:36.320
it's easy to start philosophizing

32:36.320 --> 32:40.120
and forgetting that you might die today.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.200
The angel of death sits on every word.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.440
How's that?

32:45.240 --> 32:48.160
I, how often do you actually consciously?

32:48.160 --> 32:49.640
All the time.

32:49.640 --> 32:50.680
Notice the angel?

32:50.680 --> 32:51.520
All the time.

32:54.040 --> 32:57.720
I think it's one of the things that made me peculiar.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.240
When I was in graduate school, you know,

32:59.240 --> 33:02.040
I thought about, I was,

33:02.040 --> 33:05.200
I had the thought of death in my mind all the time.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.400
And I noticed that many of the people that I was with,

33:07.400 --> 33:09.960
these were people I admired fine.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.120
That wasn't part of their character,

33:12.120 --> 33:13.840
but it was definitely part of mine.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.240
I'd wake up every morning.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.040
This happened for years, think.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.720
Time's short, get at it.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.600
Time's short, get at it.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.680
There's things to do.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.640
And so that was always, it's still there.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.920
And it's still there with, I would say,

33:27.920 --> 33:30.080
and it's unbearable in some sense.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.240
Are you afraid of it?

33:31.240 --> 33:33.000
Like what's your relationship?

33:33.000 --> 33:33.840
Yeah.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.160
You know, I was ready to die a year ago.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.440
And not casually.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.280
I had people I loved, you know.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.680
So no, I'm not very worried about me,

33:46.680 --> 33:49.320
but I'm very worried about making a mistake.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.160
Yeah.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.720
I heard Elon Musk talk about that a couple of months ago.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.720
It was really a striking moment.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.760
Someone asked him about death and he said,

33:56.760 --> 33:57.600
just offhand, eh?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.200
And then went on with the conversation.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.440
He said, ah, be a relief.

34:00.440 --> 34:02.520
And then he went on with the conversation.

34:03.760 --> 34:06.480
And I thought, well, you know,

34:06.480 --> 34:08.680
he's got a lot of weight on his shoulders.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.920
I'm sure that part of them thinks,

34:11.760 --> 34:14.920
I'm sure that part of them thinks that'd be easier

34:14.920 --> 34:18.120
just if this wasn't here at all.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.520
Now, he said it offhand,

34:19.520 --> 34:21.920
but it was a telling moment in my estimation.

34:21.920 --> 34:26.080
So for him, that's a why live question.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.160
The exhaustion of life, if you call it.

34:29.160 --> 34:32.280
Life is suffering, but the hardship.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.080
I'm more afraid of hell than death.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.880
You're afraid of the thing that follows.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.480
I don't know if it follows or if it's always here.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.000
And I think we're going to find out.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.960
What's the connection between death and hell?

34:49.960 --> 34:50.800
I don't know.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.320
I don't know.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.160
I don't know.

34:55.160 --> 34:58.280
Is there something that needs to be done before you arrive?

34:58.280 --> 35:00.120
You're more likely to die terribly

35:00.120 --> 35:03.600
if you live in a manner that brings you to hell.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.720
That's one connection.

35:04.720 --> 35:08.480
And terribly is a very deep kind of concept.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.240
Yeah, yeah.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.880
And that's a definition, by the way.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.880
What do you make of Elon Musk?

35:17.880 --> 35:19.560
You've spoken about him a bit.

35:19.560 --> 35:20.400
You met him.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.520
I'm struck with admiration.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.560
That's what I make of him.

35:23.560 --> 35:26.880
And I always think of that as a primary.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.040
Well, it's like, do you find this comedian funny?

35:30.040 --> 35:32.040
It's like, well, I laugh at him.

35:32.040 --> 35:32.860
You know what I mean?

35:32.860 --> 35:34.840
It's not propositional again.

35:34.840 --> 35:39.560
And so there are things I would like to ask Mr. Musk

35:39.560 --> 35:42.680
about the Mars venture.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.280
I don't know what he's up to there.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.960
It strikes me as absurd in the most fundamental sense

35:47.960 --> 35:49.600
because I think, well, it'd be easier just to build

35:49.600 --> 35:52.360
an outpost in the Antarctica or in the desert.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.360
Well, how much of the human endeavor is absurd?

35:54.360 --> 35:56.960
Well, that's what Nietzsche say.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.680
Great men are seldom credited with their stupidity.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.600
Who the hell knows what Musk is up to?

36:01.600 --> 36:03.880
I mean, obviously he's building rockets.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.160
Now he's motivated because he wants to build

36:06.160 --> 36:09.000
a platform for life on Mars.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.280
Is that a good idea?

36:11.640 --> 36:13.320
Who am I to say?

36:13.320 --> 36:14.880
He's building the rockets, man.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.760
But I'd like to ask him about it.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.340
I would like to see that conversation.

36:19.340 --> 36:24.340
I do think that having talked to him quite a bit offline,

36:24.600 --> 36:29.280
I think these, several of his ideas like Mars,

36:29.280 --> 36:31.920
like humans becoming a multi-planetary species

36:31.960 --> 36:35.600
could be one of the things that human civilization

36:35.600 --> 36:40.240
looks back at as, duh, I can't believe he's one

36:40.240 --> 36:42.760
of the few people that was really pushing this idea

36:42.760 --> 36:46.680
because it's the obvious thing for society,

36:46.680 --> 36:48.200
for life to survive.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.760
Yeah, well, it isn't obvious to me that I'm in any position

36:50.760 --> 36:52.600
to evaluate Elon Musk.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.400
Like I would like to talk to him and find out

36:54.400 --> 36:56.960
what he's up to and why, but I mean,

36:56.960 --> 36:58.680
he's an impossible person.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.480
What he's done is impossible, all of it.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.560
He built an electric car that works.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.440
Now, does it work completely and will it replace gas cars?

37:06.440 --> 37:07.280
Or should it?

37:07.280 --> 37:10.680
I don't know, but if we're gonna build electric cars,

37:10.680 --> 37:14.240
he seems to be the best at that by a lot.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.740
And he more or less did that, people carp about him,

37:16.740 --> 37:18.980
but he more or less did that by himself.

37:18.980 --> 37:21.440
I know he's very good at distributing responsibility

37:21.440 --> 37:23.240
and all of that, but he's the spearhead.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.120
And then that was pretty hard.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.800
And then he built a rocket at like 1 10th

37:28.800 --> 37:30.640
the price of NASA rockets.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.400
And then he shot his car out into space.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.880
That's pretty hard.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.120
And then he's building this boring company,

37:38.120 --> 37:41.200
more or less as out, what would you call it?

37:41.200 --> 37:44.480
It's sort of, it's this whimsical joke in some sense,

37:44.480 --> 37:46.280
but it's not a joke.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.320
He's amazing.

37:47.320 --> 37:51.400
And you're a link delving into the depths of the mind.

37:51.400 --> 37:55.240
And Starlink, it's like, go Elon, as far as I'm concerned.

37:55.240 --> 37:58.520
And then, you know, he puts his finger on things so oddly.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.240
The problem is underpopulation.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.560
It's like, I think so too.

38:02.560 --> 38:05.880
I think it's a terrible problem that we're the West,

38:05.880 --> 38:09.920
for example, is no longer at replacement

38:09.920 --> 38:11.000
with regard to birth rate.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.440
It means we've abandoned the Virgin and the child

38:13.440 --> 38:15.000
in a most fundamental sense.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.800
It's a bloody catastrophe and Musk, he sees it

38:18.800 --> 38:20.000
clear as can be.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.080
It's like, wow.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.760
And where everyone else is running around going,

38:22.760 --> 38:24.160
oh, there's too many people.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.900
It's like, nope, got that.

38:27.540 --> 38:31.060
See, I've learned that there are falsehoods and lies

38:31.060 --> 38:33.300
and there are anti-truths.

38:33.300 --> 38:36.100
And an anti-truth is something that's so preposterous

38:36.100 --> 38:39.660
that you couldn't make a claim

38:39.660 --> 38:42.700
that's more opposite to the truth.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.980
And the claim that there are too many people

38:44.980 --> 38:46.780
on the planet is an anti-truth.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.980
So, you know, people say, well, you have to accept limits

38:50.980 --> 38:52.100
to growth and et cetera.

38:52.100 --> 38:56.340
It's like, I have to accept the limits

38:56.340 --> 38:58.300
that you're going to impose on me

38:58.300 --> 39:00.740
because you're frightened of the future.

39:00.740 --> 39:02.540
That's your theory, isn't it?

39:02.540 --> 39:03.380
Okay.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.740
Well, it's an idea.

39:05.740 --> 39:07.100
It could be a right idea.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.380
It could be a wrong idea.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.980
I don't think anti-truth.

39:11.180 --> 39:13.940
Here, I'll tell you why it's the wrong idea, I think.

39:15.060 --> 39:18.700
So imagine that there's an emergency, dragon.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.300
There's a dragon.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.260
Someone comes and says, there's a dragon.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.660
I'm the guy to deal with it.

39:24.580 --> 39:26.220
That's what the environmentalists say.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.620
The radical types who push limits to growth.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.620
Then I look at them and I think, okay,

39:32.980 --> 39:35.380
is that dragon real or not?

39:35.380 --> 39:36.700
That's one question.

39:36.700 --> 39:37.540
Well-

39:37.540 --> 39:39.220
I ask that question of myself every time

39:39.220 --> 39:40.340
when I spend time alone.

39:40.340 --> 39:43.260
Is the apocalypse looming on the environmental front?

39:43.260 --> 39:44.100
Yes or no?

39:44.100 --> 39:46.740
I'll just leave that aside for the time being.

39:46.740 --> 39:48.660
I think you can make a case both ways

39:48.660 --> 39:50.460
for a bunch of different reasons.

39:50.460 --> 39:52.660
And it's not a trivial concern.

39:52.660 --> 39:55.100
And we've overfished the oceans terribly.

39:55.100 --> 39:59.380
And there are environmental issues that are looming large.

39:59.380 --> 40:01.940
Whether climate change is the cardinal one or not

40:01.940 --> 40:04.660
is a whole different question, but we won't get into that.

40:04.660 --> 40:05.900
That's not the issue.

40:05.900 --> 40:08.180
You're clamoring about a dragon.

40:08.180 --> 40:09.580
Okay.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.420
Why should I listen to you?

40:11.420 --> 40:14.340
Well, let's see how you're reacting to the dragon.

40:14.340 --> 40:17.340
First of all, you're scared stiff and in a state of panic.

40:18.580 --> 40:21.780
That might indicate you're not the man for the job.

40:21.780 --> 40:25.260
Second, you're willing to use compulsion

40:25.260 --> 40:28.380
to harness other people to fight the dragon for you.

40:28.380 --> 40:30.940
So now not only are you terrified,

40:30.940 --> 40:33.260
you're a terrified tyrant.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.580
So then I would say, well, then you're not the Moses

40:35.580 --> 40:39.300
that we need to lead us out of this particular Exodus.

40:39.300 --> 40:41.420
And maybe that's a neurological explanation.

40:41.420 --> 40:45.020
It's like, if you're so afraid of what you're facing

40:45.020 --> 40:47.900
that you're terrified into paralysis and nihilism

40:47.900 --> 40:50.300
and that you're willing to use tyrannical compulsion

40:50.300 --> 40:54.260
to get your way, you are not the right leader for the time.

40:54.260 --> 40:56.300
So then I like someone like Bjorn Lomborg

40:56.300 --> 40:59.060
or Matt Ridley or Marion Toopey.

40:59.060 --> 41:00.540
And they say, well, look,

41:00.540 --> 41:03.100
we've got our environmental problems

41:03.100 --> 41:06.820
and maybe you could make a case

41:06.820 --> 41:11.100
that there's a Malthusian element in some situations,

41:11.100 --> 41:14.540
but fundamentally the track record of the human race

41:14.540 --> 41:18.500
is that we learn very fast and faster all the time

41:18.500 --> 41:23.020
to do more with less and we've got this.

41:23.020 --> 41:27.780
And I think, yes, to that idea.

41:27.780 --> 41:32.380
And I think about it in a fundamental way.

41:32.380 --> 41:36.500
It's like, I trust Lomborg, I trust Toopey,

41:36.500 --> 41:38.300
I trust Matt Ridley.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.100
They've thought about these things deeply.

41:40.100 --> 41:40.940
They're not just saying,

41:40.940 --> 41:42.260
oh, the environment doesn't matter,

41:42.260 --> 41:46.220
whatever the environment is, you know, the environment.

41:46.220 --> 41:47.500
I don't even know what that is.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.620
That's everything, the environment.

41:49.620 --> 41:51.420
I'm concerned about the environment.

41:53.860 --> 41:55.740
Which is, how is that different than saying

41:55.740 --> 41:57.580
I'm worried about everything?

41:57.580 --> 42:00.780
How are those statements different semantically?

42:00.780 --> 42:02.780
Well, yeah, the environment, it could be,

42:02.780 --> 42:04.980
I'm worried about human society.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.580
A lot of these complex systems are difficult to talk about

42:07.580 --> 42:09.620
because there's so much involved for sure.

42:09.620 --> 42:10.940
Yeah, everything.

42:10.940 --> 42:12.700
And then these models,

42:12.700 --> 42:14.140
because people have gone after me

42:14.140 --> 42:15.940
because I don't buy the climate models.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.220
Well, I think about the climate models

42:18.220 --> 42:21.380
as extended into the economic models

42:21.380 --> 42:22.980
because the climate model is,

42:23.980 --> 42:25.900
well, there's gonna be a certain degree of heating,

42:25.900 --> 42:27.540
let's say by 2100.

42:27.540 --> 42:30.900
It's like, okay, some of that might be human generated.

42:30.900 --> 42:33.700
Some of it's a consequence of warming after the ice age.

42:33.700 --> 42:36.220
This has happened before, but fair enough.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.580
Let's take your presumption,

42:38.580 --> 42:40.740
although there are multiple presumptions

42:40.740 --> 42:44.820
and any error in your model multiplies as time extends,

42:44.860 --> 42:46.700
but have it your way.

42:46.700 --> 42:48.700
Okay, now we're gonna extend the climate model,

42:48.700 --> 42:50.820
so to speak, into the economic model.

42:50.820 --> 42:53.780
So I just did an analysis of a paper by Deloitte,

42:55.020 --> 42:57.780
third biggest company in the US,

42:59.100 --> 43:01.900
300,000 employees, major league consultants.

43:01.900 --> 43:03.740
They just produced a report in May.

43:03.740 --> 43:05.420
I wrote an article for it in The Telegraph,

43:05.420 --> 43:08.740
which I'm gonna release this week on my YouTube channel.

43:08.740 --> 43:13.540
Said, well, if we get the climate problem under control,

43:13.540 --> 43:15.900
economically, because that's where the models

43:15.900 --> 43:18.020
are now being generated on the economic front,

43:18.020 --> 43:21.380
so now we have to model the environment, that's climate,

43:21.380 --> 43:23.620
and we have to model the economy,

43:23.620 --> 43:26.540
and then we have to model their joint interaction,

43:26.540 --> 43:29.820
and then we have to predict 100 years into the future,

43:29.820 --> 43:32.700
and then we have to put a dollar value on that,

43:32.700 --> 43:35.380
and then we have to claim that we can do that,

43:35.380 --> 43:38.740
which we can't, and then this is our conclusion.

43:39.740 --> 43:43.820
We're going to go through a difficult period of privation,

43:43.820 --> 43:45.700
because if we don't accept limits to growth,

43:45.700 --> 43:47.340
there's gonna be a catastrophe,

43:47.340 --> 43:49.260
50 years in the future, thereabouts,

43:49.260 --> 43:52.060
and so to avert that catastrophe,

43:52.060 --> 43:55.820
we are going to make people poorer now.

43:55.820 --> 43:56.940
How much poorer?

43:56.940 --> 43:58.820
Well, not a lot compared to how much richer

43:58.820 --> 44:01.460
they're going to be, but definitely,

44:01.460 --> 44:03.140
and they say this in their own models,

44:03.140 --> 44:06.340
definitely poorer, definitely poorer,

44:06.340 --> 44:09.940
than they would be if we just left them to hell alone,

44:09.940 --> 44:14.220
and so then I think, okay, poorer, eh?

44:14.220 --> 44:15.220
Who?

44:15.220 --> 44:17.140
Well, let's look at it biologically,

44:17.140 --> 44:22.140
got a hierarchy, right, of stability and security,

44:22.940 --> 44:25.020
that's a hierarchy, or one type.

44:26.420 --> 44:28.900
You stress a hierarchy like that, a social hierarchy,

44:28.900 --> 44:31.900
so there's birds in an environment,

44:31.900 --> 44:33.620
and an avian flu comes in,

44:33.620 --> 44:35.700
and then you look at the birds in the social hierarchy,

44:35.700 --> 44:39.540
and the low-ranking birds have the worst nests,

44:39.540 --> 44:41.740
so they're most exposed to wind and rain and sun,

44:41.740 --> 44:43.940
and farthest from food supplies,

44:43.940 --> 44:45.300
and most exposed to predators,

44:45.300 --> 44:46.820
and so those birds are stressed,

44:46.820 --> 44:49.060
which is what happens to you at the bottom of a hierarchy,

44:49.060 --> 44:50.340
you're more stressed,

44:50.340 --> 44:52.180
because your life is more uncertain,

44:52.180 --> 44:53.020
you're more stressed,

44:53.020 --> 44:56.220
your immunological function is compromised because of that,

44:56.220 --> 44:58.540
you're sacrificing the future for the present,

44:59.500 --> 45:00.700
an avian flu comes in,

45:00.700 --> 45:02.940
and the birds die from the bottom up,

45:02.940 --> 45:04.620
that happens in every epidemic,

45:04.620 --> 45:08.300
you die from the bottom up, okay,

45:08.300 --> 45:11.820
so they say when the aristocracy catches a cold,

45:11.820 --> 45:13.980
the working class dies of pneumonia,

45:13.980 --> 45:16.380
all right, so now we're gonna make people poorer,

45:17.820 --> 45:19.420
okay, who?

45:19.420 --> 45:23.020
Well, we know who we make poorer when we make people poorer,

45:23.020 --> 45:27.180
we make those who are barely hanging on poorer,

45:27.180 --> 45:28.900
and what does that mean?

45:28.900 --> 45:30.100
It means they die,

45:30.900 --> 45:34.980
and so what the Deloitte consultants are basically saying is,

45:34.980 --> 45:38.300
well, you know, it's kind of unfortunate,

45:39.140 --> 45:41.700
but according to our models,

45:41.700 --> 45:44.620
a lot of poor people are gonna have to die,

45:44.620 --> 45:47.340
so that a lot more poor people don't die in the future,

45:47.340 --> 45:49.460
it's like, okay, hold on a sec,

45:49.460 --> 45:51.540
which of those two things am I supposed to regard

45:51.540 --> 45:52.820
with certainty,

45:52.820 --> 45:54.900
the hypothetical poor people that you're gonna

45:54.900 --> 45:57.860
hypothetically save 100 years from now,

45:57.860 --> 46:01.460
or the actual poor people that you are actually going

46:01.460 --> 46:04.180
to kill in the next 10 years?

46:05.180 --> 46:08.020
Well, I'm gonna cast my lot with the actual poor people

46:08.020 --> 46:09.780
that you're actually going to kill,

46:11.180 --> 46:13.060
and so, and then I think further,

46:13.060 --> 46:16.260
it's like, well, okay, the Deloitte consultants,

46:16.260 --> 46:18.180
have you actually modeled the world,

46:18.180 --> 46:21.060
or is this a big advertising shtick designed

46:21.060 --> 46:23.780
to attract your corporate clients with demonstration

46:23.780 --> 46:26.060
that you're so intelligent that you can actually model

46:26.060 --> 46:28.140
the entire ecosystem of the world,

46:28.140 --> 46:30.100
including the economic system,

46:30.100 --> 46:32.500
and predict it 100 years forward,

46:32.500 --> 46:34.260
and isn't there a bit of a moral hazard

46:34.260 --> 46:36.340
in making a claim like that?

46:36.340 --> 46:39.220
Just like, just a trifle, especially when,

46:39.220 --> 46:42.100
so I talked to Bjorn Lomborg and Michael Jahn last week,

46:42.100 --> 46:47.100
I accepted the UN estimates of starvation this coming year,

46:47.980 --> 46:52.220
150 million people will suffer food insecurity,

46:52.220 --> 46:55.980
food insecurity, yeah, food insecurity,

46:55.980 --> 46:59.060
that's the bloody buzzword, famine.

46:59.060 --> 47:03.140
Well, Michael Jahn thought 1.2 billion,

47:03.140 --> 47:05.860
and then that it'll spiral, because he said,

47:05.860 --> 47:08.660
what happens in a famine is that the governments

47:08.660 --> 47:12.980
go nuts, crazy, the governments destabilize,

47:13.900 --> 47:17.500
and then they appropriate the food from the farmers,

47:17.500 --> 47:19.820
then the farmers don't have any money,

47:19.820 --> 47:22.340
then they can't grow crops, and I think,

47:22.340 --> 47:24.380
yeah, that's exactly what they do,

47:24.380 --> 47:26.460
that's exactly what would happen.

47:26.460 --> 47:29.540
And so, Jahn told me 1.2 billion,

47:29.540 --> 47:32.060
and then Bjorn Lomborg said the same thing,

47:32.060 --> 47:33.820
I didn't even ask him, he just made it

47:33.820 --> 47:37.700
as an offhand comment, so.

47:37.700 --> 47:41.660
Let me ask you about the famine of the 30s.

47:41.660 --> 47:43.060
Yeah.

47:43.060 --> 47:44.460
Do you think- In the Ukraine?

47:44.460 --> 47:47.140
In the Ukraine. Oh yeah, fun, fun, fun.

47:47.140 --> 47:49.940
Similar, a lot of the things you mentioned

47:49.940 --> 47:52.700
in the last few sentences kind of echo

47:52.700 --> 47:55.140
to that part of human history.

47:55.140 --> 47:56.620
The hole in the door.

47:56.620 --> 47:58.300
Do you- No one knows about.

47:59.620 --> 48:02.740
Well, now I've just spent four weeks in Ukraine,

48:02.740 --> 48:05.300
there's different parts of the world that still,

48:05.300 --> 48:08.820
even if they don't know, they know.

48:08.820 --> 48:09.860
Yeah, right.

48:09.860 --> 48:12.740
They feel history runs in the blood.

48:12.740 --> 48:15.620
The Dutch knew, in some sense, they had a famine

48:15.620 --> 48:17.620
at the end of World War II, and part of the reason

48:17.620 --> 48:19.980
that Dutch farmers are so unbelievably efficient

48:20.060 --> 48:22.580
and productive is that the Dutch swore

48:22.580 --> 48:24.700
at the end of World War II that that was not going

48:24.700 --> 48:27.900
to happen again, and then they had to scrape land

48:27.900 --> 48:31.220
out of the ocean, because Holland, that's quite a country,

48:31.220 --> 48:32.740
it shouldn't even exist.

48:32.740 --> 48:35.140
The fact that it's the world's number two exporter,

48:35.140 --> 48:37.100
you know that it's the world's number two exporter

48:37.100 --> 48:39.900
of agricultural products, Holland.

48:39.900 --> 48:43.340
It's like, I don't think it's as big as Massachusetts,

48:43.340 --> 48:46.420
it's this little tiny place, it shouldn't even exist,

48:46.420 --> 48:49.340
and they want to put, here's the plan,

48:49.380 --> 48:52.660
let's put 30% of the farmers out of business,

48:52.660 --> 48:55.740
while the broader ecosystem of agricultural production

48:55.740 --> 48:58.420
in Holland is 6% of their GDP.

48:58.420 --> 49:01.540
Now these centralizing politicians think,

49:01.540 --> 49:03.500
tell me if I'm stupid about this.

49:04.620 --> 49:09.620
Take an industry, you knock it back by fiat by 30%.

49:12.820 --> 49:15.220
Now it runs on like a 3% profit margin,

49:15.220 --> 49:17.420
now you're gonna kill 30% of it.

49:18.260 --> 49:20.540
How are you not gonna bring the whole thing down,

49:20.540 --> 49:22.860
the whole farming ecosystem down?

49:22.860 --> 49:27.140
How are you not gonna impoverish the transport systems?

49:27.140 --> 49:30.740
How are you not gonna demolish the grocery stores?

49:30.740 --> 49:33.700
You can't take something like that and pare it back

49:33.700 --> 49:37.100
by fiat by 30% and not kill it.

49:37.100 --> 49:39.380
I can't see how you can do that.

49:39.380 --> 49:41.940
I mean, look what we did with the COVID lockdowns.

49:41.940 --> 49:43.900
We broke the supply chains,

49:43.900 --> 49:45.540
tried buying something lately,

49:46.500 --> 49:47.460
you can't, and wait,

49:47.460 --> 49:50.900
and aren't the Chinese threatening Taiwan at the moment?

49:50.900 --> 49:52.660
What are we gonna do without chips?

49:53.820 --> 49:56.660
So I don't know what these people are thinking.

49:56.660 --> 49:58.220
And then I think, okay, what are they thinking?

49:58.220 --> 50:00.460
Well, the Deloitte people are thinking, aren't we smart?

50:00.460 --> 50:02.860
And shouldn't we be hired by our corporate employers?

50:02.860 --> 50:05.820
It's like, okay, too bad about the poor.

50:06.740 --> 50:09.660
What are the environmentalists thinking?

50:09.660 --> 50:11.060
We love the planet.

50:11.060 --> 50:12.580
It's like, do you?

50:12.580 --> 50:14.540
We love the poor, do you?

50:14.580 --> 50:17.100
Okay, let's pit the planet against the poor.

50:17.100 --> 50:17.940
Who wins?

50:17.940 --> 50:19.380
The planet, okay.

50:19.380 --> 50:21.100
You don't love the poor that much.

50:21.100 --> 50:22.900
Do you love the planet?

50:22.900 --> 50:24.820
Or do you hate capitalism?

50:24.820 --> 50:27.220
Let's pit those two things against each other.

50:27.220 --> 50:29.900
Oh, well, it turns out we actually hate capitalism.

50:29.900 --> 50:31.460
How can we tell?

50:31.460 --> 50:33.420
Because you're willing to break it.

50:33.420 --> 50:34.580
And do you know what's gonna happen?

50:34.580 --> 50:35.980
So what's gonna happen in Sri Lanka

50:35.980 --> 50:38.980
with these 20 million people who now have nothing to eat?

50:38.980 --> 50:40.900
Are they gonna eat all the animals?

50:40.900 --> 50:42.500
Are they gonna burn all the firewood?

50:42.540 --> 50:44.580
They're stockpiling firewood in Germany.

50:45.580 --> 50:48.380
It's like, so is your environmental globalist utopia

50:49.300 --> 50:51.780
gonna kill the poor and destroy the planet?

50:51.780 --> 50:54.260
And that's okay, because we'll wipe out capitalism.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.420
It's like, okay.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.900
Yeah, the dragon and the fear of the dragon

50:57.900 --> 51:01.100
drives ideologies, some of which can build a better world,

51:01.100 --> 51:03.180
some of which can destroy that world.

51:03.180 --> 51:07.420
Now, what do you think of that theory about trustworthiness?

51:07.420 --> 51:09.540
If the dragon that you're facing

51:09.540 --> 51:12.060
turns you into a terrified tyrant,

51:12.060 --> 51:14.300
you're not the man for the job.

51:14.300 --> 51:15.580
Is that a good theory?

51:15.580 --> 51:16.700
It's an interesting theory.

51:16.700 --> 51:18.460
Let me use that theory to challenge,

51:18.460 --> 51:21.020
because what does terror look like?

51:21.020 --> 51:25.420
Let me table the turns, turn the tables on you.

51:27.180 --> 51:32.180
You are terrified, afraid, concerned

51:35.500 --> 51:40.500
about the dragon of something we can call communism, Marxism.

51:43.060 --> 51:45.180
Am I terrified of it?

51:45.180 --> 51:47.020
Not terrified enough to be a tyrant.

51:47.020 --> 51:48.860
Your theories had two components.

51:48.860 --> 51:49.940
Yeah.

51:49.940 --> 51:50.780
I'm not paralyzed.

51:50.780 --> 51:52.100
It had a dragon.

51:52.100 --> 51:55.260
Yeah, I'm not paralyzed, and I don't wanna be a tyrant.

51:55.260 --> 51:58.340
The tyrant part, I think, is missing with you.

51:59.460 --> 52:00.740
You are very concerned.

52:00.740 --> 52:02.660
The intensity of your feeling

52:05.620 --> 52:08.300
does not give much space,

52:08.300 --> 52:10.980
actually, at least in your public persona,

52:11.020 --> 52:13.660
for sitting quietly with the dragon

52:13.660 --> 52:15.180
and sipping in a couple of beers

52:15.180 --> 52:16.780
and thinking about this thing.

52:17.700 --> 52:20.500
The intensity of your anger,

52:20.500 --> 52:25.020
concern about certain things you're seeing in society,

52:25.020 --> 52:27.100
is that going to drive you off the path

52:27.100 --> 52:29.500
that ultimately takes us to a better world?

52:29.500 --> 52:30.780
That's a good question.

52:30.780 --> 52:33.780
I mean, I'm trying to get that right.

52:33.780 --> 52:36.460
So we've kind of come to a cultural conclusion

52:36.460 --> 52:37.540
about the Nazis.

52:38.580 --> 52:40.860
Do you get to be angry about the Nazis?

52:41.700 --> 52:43.100
It seems the answer to that is yes.

52:44.420 --> 52:46.460
Well, actually, let me push back here.

52:47.740 --> 52:51.660
I also don't trust people who are angry about the Nazis.

52:51.660 --> 52:53.180
I mean the actual Nazis.

52:53.180 --> 52:56.620
Well, as you know,

52:56.620 --> 52:58.500
there's a lot of people in the world

53:00.420 --> 53:04.620
that use actual Nazis to mean a lot of things.

53:04.620 --> 53:05.460
I know, I know.

53:05.460 --> 53:07.300
One of them is very important to me.

53:07.300 --> 53:08.500
Me, for example.

53:09.100 --> 53:13.820
He's a Nazi, or magical super Nazi, as it turns out.

53:13.820 --> 53:15.660
I think they actually sort of steal man

53:15.660 --> 53:16.860
all of their perspectives.

53:16.860 --> 53:19.900
I think a lot of people that call you a Nazi mean it.

53:20.900 --> 53:24.700
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

53:24.700 --> 53:26.460
There's an important thing there though,

53:26.460 --> 53:29.500
because I went to the front in Ukraine,

53:29.500 --> 53:31.060
and a lot of the people

53:33.660 --> 53:37.180
that lost their home or they're kind of,

53:37.220 --> 53:39.540
that got to interact a lot with the Russian soldiers,

53:39.540 --> 53:42.820
Ukrainian people that interacted with the Russian soldiers,

53:42.820 --> 53:46.420
they've reported that the Russian soldiers

53:46.420 --> 53:51.420
really believe they're saving the people of Ukraine

53:53.020 --> 53:55.820
in these local villages from the Nazis.

53:55.820 --> 53:56.740
I understand, yeah.

53:56.740 --> 54:00.980
So to them, it's not just that the Ukrainian government has,

54:00.980 --> 54:02.900
or Ukraine has some Nazis,

54:02.900 --> 54:05.140
it's like it has been,

54:05.140 --> 54:08.180
the idea is that the Nazis have taken over Ukraine

54:08.180 --> 54:09.940
and we need to free them.

54:09.940 --> 54:11.260
This is the belief.

54:11.260 --> 54:16.260
So this, again, Nazi is still a dragon that lives,

54:16.300 --> 54:18.980
and it's used by people because it's safe

54:18.980 --> 54:20.420
to sit next to that dragon

54:20.420 --> 54:22.700
and spread any kind of ideology you want.

54:22.700 --> 54:27.260
So I just want to kind of say that we have agreed

54:27.260 --> 54:31.860
on this particular dragon,

54:31.860 --> 54:34.140
but I still don't trust anybody who uses that one.

54:34.140 --> 54:36.860
Yeah, but we have issues with boundaries, right?

54:36.860 --> 54:38.060
No, no, it's,

54:38.060 --> 54:40.700
so this is a very complicated problem, right?

54:40.700 --> 54:45.420
So René Girard believed that it was a human proclivity

54:45.420 --> 54:46.940
to demonize the scapegoat

54:46.940 --> 54:48.420
and then drive it out of the village.

54:48.420 --> 54:50.780
And I've thought about that a lot.

54:50.780 --> 54:52.500
We need a place to put Satan.

54:53.540 --> 54:55.900
Seriously, this is a serious issue.

54:55.900 --> 54:58.300
Should he be inside the village or outside?

54:58.300 --> 55:02.060
Well, maybe he should be inside you, right?

55:02.060 --> 55:05.700
That's the fundamental essence of the Christian doctrine.

55:05.700 --> 55:08.140
It's like Satan is best fought

55:08.140 --> 55:10.980
on the battleground of your soul.

55:12.580 --> 55:15.180
And that's right.

55:16.740 --> 55:17.660
It's right.

55:17.660 --> 55:18.740
Can you actually put words

55:18.740 --> 55:20.540
to the kind of dragon that you're fighting?

55:20.540 --> 55:22.460
Is it communism?

55:22.460 --> 55:24.700
It's the spirit of Cain, yeah.

55:26.460 --> 55:30.700
Can you elaborate what the spirit of Cain is?

55:31.700 --> 55:36.100
So after Adam and Eve are thrown out of paradise

55:36.100 --> 55:37.700
for becoming self-conscious

55:37.700 --> 55:40.100
or when they become self-conscious,

55:40.100 --> 55:41.660
they're destined to work.

55:42.580 --> 55:44.500
And the reason for that, as far as I can tell,

55:44.500 --> 55:47.380
is that to become self-conscious

55:47.380 --> 55:49.420
is to become aware of the future.

55:49.420 --> 55:51.060
It's to become aware of death.

55:51.060 --> 55:53.340
That certainly happens in the Adam and Eve story,

55:53.340 --> 55:55.980
to have the scales fall from your eyes.

55:55.980 --> 55:58.260
And then the consequence of that

55:58.300 --> 56:00.460
is that you now have to labor

56:00.460 --> 56:03.500
to prevent the catastrophes of the future.

56:03.500 --> 56:04.620
That's work.

56:04.620 --> 56:06.420
Work is sacrifice.

56:06.420 --> 56:08.980
Sacrifice of the present to the future.

56:08.980 --> 56:12.180
It's delay of gratification, it's maturity.

56:12.180 --> 56:15.180
It's sacrifice to something as well

56:15.180 --> 56:17.500
and in the spirit of something.

56:17.500 --> 56:22.500
Okay, so now Adam and Eve have two children, Cain and Abel.

56:22.740 --> 56:25.740
So those are the first two people in history

56:25.740 --> 56:28.140
because the Garden of Eden doesn't count.

56:29.020 --> 56:31.140
And they're the first two people who are born

56:31.140 --> 56:31.980
rather than created.

56:31.980 --> 56:33.700
So they're the first two people.

56:33.700 --> 56:34.860
And that's a hell of a story

56:34.860 --> 56:37.740
because it's a story of fratricidal murder

56:37.740 --> 56:41.620
that degenerates into genocide, flood and tyranny.

56:41.620 --> 56:46.620
So that's fun for the opening salvo of the story, let's say.

56:46.620 --> 56:49.740
And Abel and Cain both make sacrifices.

56:49.740 --> 56:53.260
And for some reason, Abel's sacrifices please God.

56:53.260 --> 56:55.340
It's not exactly clear why.

56:55.340 --> 56:57.100
And Cain's don't.

56:57.420 --> 57:00.420
There's an implication in the text

57:00.420 --> 57:04.980
that it's because Cain's sacrifices are second rate.

57:04.980 --> 57:07.900
God says that Abel brings the finest

57:07.900 --> 57:09.620
to the sacrificial altar.

57:09.620 --> 57:11.300
He doesn't say that about Cain.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.700
So you could imagine that Cain is sacrificing away,

57:13.700 --> 57:16.340
but he's holding something in reserve.

57:16.340 --> 57:17.340
He's not all in.

57:17.340 --> 57:19.780
He's not bringing his best to the table.

57:19.780 --> 57:22.140
He's not offering his best to God.

57:22.140 --> 57:26.660
And so Abel thrives like mad and everyone loves him

57:26.660 --> 57:28.700
and he gets exactly what he needs and wants,

57:28.700 --> 57:30.860
exactly when he needs and wants it.

57:30.860 --> 57:32.820
He's favored of God.

57:32.820 --> 57:36.140
And Cain is bearing this terrible burden forward

57:36.140 --> 57:40.260
and working and his sacrifices are rejected.

57:40.260 --> 57:45.060
So he gets resentful, really resentful,

57:46.780 --> 57:51.380
resentful enough to call God out and say something like,

57:51.380 --> 57:54.660
this is quite the creation you've got going here.

57:55.620 --> 57:57.260
I'm breaking myself in half

57:57.260 --> 58:00.140
and nothing good's coming my way.

58:00.140 --> 58:01.500
What the hell's up with that?

58:01.500 --> 58:04.860
And then there's Abel, the sun's shining on him every day.

58:04.860 --> 58:06.020
How dare you?

58:06.900 --> 58:10.260
Okay, but this is God that Cain's talking to.

58:10.260 --> 58:14.620
And so God says what Cain least wants to hear,

58:14.620 --> 58:17.100
which is what God usually says to people.

58:17.100 --> 58:20.980
He says, look to your own devices.

58:20.980 --> 58:24.140
You're not making the sacrifices you should

58:24.180 --> 58:25.420
and you know it.

58:25.420 --> 58:27.820
And then he says something even worse.

58:27.820 --> 58:31.860
He says, sin crouches at your door

58:31.860 --> 58:34.540
like a sexually aroused predatory animal

58:35.620 --> 58:39.420
and you've invited it in to have your way,

58:39.420 --> 58:41.580
to have its way with you.

58:41.580 --> 58:42.900
And so he basically says,

58:42.900 --> 58:47.580
you have allowed your resentment to preoccupy yourself

58:47.580 --> 58:49.380
and now you're brooding upon it

58:49.380 --> 58:52.860
and generating something creative, new and awful,

58:52.860 --> 58:55.140
possessed by the spirit of resentment.

58:56.260 --> 58:59.460
And that's why you're in the miserable state you're in.

58:59.460 --> 59:03.060
So then Cain leaves, his countenance falls

59:03.060 --> 59:04.940
as you might expect and Cain leaves

59:04.940 --> 59:07.860
and he's so incensed by this because God has said,

59:07.860 --> 59:11.660
look, your problems are of your own making.

59:11.660 --> 59:13.740
And not only that, you invited them in

59:13.740 --> 59:16.460
and not only that, you engaged in this creatively

59:16.460 --> 59:18.740
and not only that, you're blaming it on me.

59:18.740 --> 59:21.180
And not only that, that's making you jealous of Abel

59:21.180 --> 59:23.460
who's your actual idol and goal.

59:23.460 --> 59:28.460
And Cain, instead of changing, kills Abel, right?

59:29.460 --> 59:31.940
And then Cain's descendants are the first people

59:31.940 --> 59:34.220
who make weapons of war.

59:35.420 --> 59:39.340
And so that's, okay, you wanna know what I think?

59:39.340 --> 59:41.460
That's the eternal story of mankind

59:42.500 --> 59:44.420
and it's playing out right now,

59:44.420 --> 59:47.020
except at a thousand times the rate.

59:47.020 --> 59:50.100
Can I present to you a difficult truth?

59:52.300 --> 59:56.180
Perhaps not a truth, but a thought I have

59:56.180 --> 59:59.500
that it is not always easy to know

59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.860
which among us are the Cain.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.100
That's for sure.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:08.100
And resentment, it is possible to imagine you

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.180
as the person who has a resentment

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:17.020
towards a particular worldview

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:19.060
that you really worry about.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.740
Yeah, well, I talked to a good friend of mine

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:25.140
last week about that publicly, well, we'll release it.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.740
So I said, well, do I have a particular animus

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.420
against the left, let's say?

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.460
It's like, well, probably.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.460
Okay, why?

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:38.460
Well, first of all, I'm a university professor.

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.940
It's not like the universities are threatened by the right.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.180
They're threatened by the left, 100%.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.020
And they're not just threatened a little bit.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.700
They're threatened a lot.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.740
And that threat made it impossible for me

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:53.140
to continue in my profession the way I was.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.580
And it cost me my clinical practice too.

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.780
And that's not over yet because I have 10 lawsuits

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.260
against me out right now from the College of Psychologists

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.220
because they've allowed anyone to complain about me

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.780
anywhere in the world for any reason

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.540
and have the choice to follow that up

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.020
with an investigation, which is a punishment

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.340
in and of itself and are doing so.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:17.740
And then I've been tortured nearly to death

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.500
multiple times by bad actors on the left.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.340
Now I've had my fair share of radical right-wingers

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.420
being unhappy with what I've said,

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:32.020
but personally, that's been the left the whole time.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.660
Not only me, but my family put my family at risk

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:39.460
in a big way and constantly, like not once or twice

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:43.180
because many people get canceled once or twice.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.660
But I've been canceled like 40 times.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:49.700
And I know like 200 people now who've been canceled.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.180
And I can tell you without doubt

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.180
that it is one of the worst experiences of their life.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.940
And that's if it only happens once.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.940
And so, and then I also know that the communists killed

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.100
100 million people in the 20th century,

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.860
that the intellectuals excused them for it nonstop

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:14.620
and still haven't quit, that almost no one knows about it.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:17.260
And that the specter of resentful Marxism

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:19.060
is back in full force.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:22.180
And so do I have a bit of an animus against that?

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.020
Yes.

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.340
Does it go too far?

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:27.420
I don't know.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.820
I'm trying to figure that out.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:33.620
The story you just told, it seems nearly impossible

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.940
for you, an intellectual powerhouse,

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.500
not to have a tremendous amount of resentment.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.340
Well.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.220
And this is the, so let me challenge you.

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.740
Yeah, go right ahead.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:43.700
Let me challenge you.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:48.700
Can you steel man the case that the prime minister

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:55.340
of this country, Trudeau, wants the best for this country

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.900
and actually might do good things for this country

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.500
as an intellectual challenge?

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.340
Sure.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:04.420
He seems to get along well with his wife.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.660
He has some kids, there's no sexual scandals

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.780
and he's in a position where that could easily be the case.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:13.380
He seems to have done some good things

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.700
on the oceanic management front.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.020
He's put a fair bit of Canada's oceans

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.420
into marine protected areas

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.900
and that might be his most fundamental legacy,

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.260
if it's real.

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.580
I've been trying to get information

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.220
about the actual reality of the protection

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.140
and I haven't been able to do that, but that's a good thing.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.500
So sorry, the family thing is there's some aspect of-

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.820
It speaks to his character.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:38.220
There is some aspect to him that makes him a good man

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.060
in that sense.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.740
I mean, there's the evidence there.

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.420
I mean, he's not a Jeffrey Epstein profligate

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.380
on the sexual front, so that's something.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.900
And his wife, they seem to have a real marriage

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.900
and he has kids, so good for him.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.180
That's a good start, by the way, for a leader.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.020
Yeah, right.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:55.860
To be a good man.

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.220
Well, then I also thought, okay, well,

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.900
after the liberals had brought in a Harvard intellectual

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.300
who was a Canadian to be their last leader,

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.140
he didn't work out.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.340
And then they're flailing about for a leader

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.020
and the liberals in Canada are pretty good

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:14.900
at maintaining power and leadership

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.660
and have been the dominant governing party

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.620
in Canada for a long time.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.980
And so they went to Justin and said,

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:24.700
well, you know, it's you are a conservative

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.780
and you can imagine that's not a positive specter

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:32.140
for someone who's on the left or even a liberal,

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.020
especially, and Trudeau is quite a bit on the left.

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.380
And they said, we need you to run.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:40.620
And then I thought, okay, well, the answer to that

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:44.020
should have been no, because the Trudeau Justin

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.500
has no training for this, no experience.

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.180
He's not, he is a part-time drama teacher fundamentally.

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.300
He hadn't run a business.

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.180
He just didn't know enough to be prime minister.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.540
But then I'm trying to put myself in his position.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.380
So it's like, okay, I don't know enough,

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.820
but I'm young and we don't want the conservatives.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.500
And they had had a run, a 10-year run.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.300
So maybe it was time for a new government.

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:08.540
I could, maybe I could grow into this man.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.900
Maybe I could surround myself with good people

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.140
and I could learn humbly and I could become

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.900
the person I'm now pretending to be,

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.620
which we all have to do as we move forward, right?

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.420
And so, and so then I thought, okay,

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:24.900
I think you made a mistake there

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:28.100
because you ran only on your father's name

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.620
and you didn't have the background,

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.260
but let's give the devil his due and say that's no problem.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.980
Okay, so now what do you do?

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.860
Well, you get elected and your first act is

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:42.460
to make the cabinet 50% women,

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.420
despite the fact that only 25%

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:47.060
of the elected members are female.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.460
It's like, okay, you just halved your talent pool.

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.980
That was a really bad move for your first move.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.140
Can I ask you about that?

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.020
Yeah.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.820
Do you think, where does that move come from?

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:03.580
Deep somewhere in the heart or is it trying to listen

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.740
to the social forces that of the moment

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:10.620
and try to ride those ways towards maybe greater,

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.180
greater popularity?

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.420
By, after thinking it through, it's like, no,

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:18.100
you just have your talent pool for cabinet positions.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.100
That's what you did.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.820
There's enough cabinet positions.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.260
You know, you could argue that each of the met threshold,

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.060
it's like, there's a big difference

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:27.940
between threshold and excellent.

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.020
So you don't think that came from a place of compassion?

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.100
I don't care if it did.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.140
I don't regard compassion as a virtue.

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.380
Compassion is a reflex, not a virtue.

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.260
You don't think- Judicious compassion is a virtue.

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.820
Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:44.660
Compassion can come deep from the human heart

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.140
and the human mind, I think.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.420
Are we talking about the same kind of compassion?

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.260
Yes.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.080
Trying to understand the suffering-

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.020
Treating adults like infants is not virtuous.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:53.860
I see.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:58.100
Well, compassion isn't treating adults like infants.

01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.620
I mean, those are just terms.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:00.460
Are you sure?

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.300
Okay.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.620
Whatever the term is, love is maybe the better word.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.540
Edible compassion is?

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.540
I mean, I suppose I'm speaking to love.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.860
You don't think those ideas came from concern?

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.700
Love is compassion.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:15.700
You don't think those-

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.940
Love is a blend of compassion and encouragement and truth.

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.540
Love is complicated, man.

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:22.180
Yeah, it has a lot of different things in it, yes.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.700
If I love you, is it compassion or encouragement

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:25.620
you want from me?

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:27.460
Yeah, it's a dance.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.140
Love is definitely a dance of two humans,

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.140
ultimately, that leads to the growth of both.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.020
Well, that's the thing.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:34.660
The growth element is crucial

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.260
because the growth element,

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.100
to foster the growth element, that requires judgment.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.860
Compassion and judgment, well, even,

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.860
and have been conceptualized this way forever,

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:48.740
two hands of God, mercy and justice.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.900
They have to operate in tandem, right?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:55.900
And mercy is flawed as you are, you're acceptable.

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.500
It's like, well, do you want that?

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.060
Do you want your flaws to be acceptable?

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:03.340
And the answer to that is no.

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:05.260
So it's like, well, that's where the judgment comes in.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.460
It's like, but you could be better.

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.260
You could be more than you are.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.980
And that's the maternal and the paternal

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.860
in some fundamental sense.

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:17.860
And there has to be an active exchange of information

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.300
between those two poles.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.300
So even if Trudeau was motivated by compassion

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.140
and it's like, yeah, just how loving are you?

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.100
First of all, no, it was a really bad decision.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.100
And then he, and he's expressed contempt

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.940
for monetary policy.

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.540
I'm not interested in monetary policy.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:39.540
It's like, okay, but you're a prime minister.

01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:41.820
And he's expressed admiration

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.940
for the Chinese communist party

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.220
because they can be very efficient

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.180
in their pursuit of environmental goals.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:51.620
It's like, oh yeah, efficiency, eh?

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.980
The efficiency of the tyranny

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.140
in the service of your terror.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.260
And so, and I've watched him repeatedly

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.700
and I've listened to him a lot

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.060
and I've tried to do that clinically

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.780
and with some degree of dispassion.

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:09.780
And that's hard too, because his father Pierre

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:14.780
devastated the West in 1982 with the national energy policy.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:18.140
And Trudeau is doing exactly the same thing again.

01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:20.220
And so as a Westerner as well,

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:24.660
I have an inbuilt animus and one that's well-deserved

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.620
because central Canada,

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.340
especially the glittery, literati elite types

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:34.500
in the Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto triangle

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:39.500
have exploited the West and expressed contempt

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:42.940
for the West far too much for far too long.

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:45.340
And that's accelerating at the moment, for example,

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:48.860
with Trudeau's recent attack on the Canadian farmers.

01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:52.500
He's an enemy of the oil and gas industry.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.820
It's an utter and absolute bloody catastrophe

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:56.740
and look what's happened in Europe,

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.700
at least in partial consequence.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.020
And he's no friend to the farmers.

01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:04.140
So I've tried to steel man him, you know?

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.060
I try to put myself in the position

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.340
of the people that I'm criticizing.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.940
I think he's a narcissist.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.300
Do you think there's a degree to which power changed him?

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.340
If you're not suited for the position,

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:18.740
if you're not the man for the position,

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.660
you can be absolutely 100% sure

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.020
that the power will corrupt you.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.900
How could it not?

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.700
I mean, at the least, if you don't have the chops

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.740
for the job, you have to devalue the job

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.980
to the point where you can feel comfortable inhabiting it.

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.860
So yes, I think that it's corrupted him.

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:39.940
And I mean, look at him doubling down.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:43.340
We wear masks in flights into Canada.

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:46.340
We have to fill out an arrive can bureaucratic form

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.220
on our phones because a passport isn't good enough.

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:50.740
We can't get a passport.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:53.420
What if you're 85 and you don't know

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:54.980
how to use a smartphone?

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.300
Oh well, too bad for you.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.180
It's like, yes, it's corrupted him.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:04.260
Would you talk to him?

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.020
If you were to sit down and talk with him

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.660
and he wanted to talk,

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.660
would you, and what kind of things would you talk about,

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:12.020
perhaps, on your podcast?

01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:15.060
I don't think I've ever said no to talking to anyone.

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.780
So which is, you know.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:21.500
Would that be a first or would you make that conversation?

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.100
Do you believe in the power of conversation

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.420
in those kinds of contexts?

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:27.260
No, if he was willing to talk to me,

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.940
I'd talk because I'd like to ask him.

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:30.740
I have lots of things I'd like to ask him about.

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:33.420
I mean, I've had political types in Canada on my podcast

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.220
and tried to ask them questions.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:36.540
So I'd like to know.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.820
Maybe I've got a big part of them wrong.

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:41.660
Yes.

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:45.860
And I probably do, but my observation has been

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.100
that every chance he had to retreat

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.740
from his pharaonic position, let's say, he doubled down.

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:56.740
And these, our parliament is not running for the next year.

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.140
It's still zoom in.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.460
It's still COVID lockdown parliament.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:07.660
For the next year, it's already been fatally compromised,

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:12.940
perhaps, by the lockdowns for the last couple of years.

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:15.220
And this is parliament we're talking about.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.060
Yeah.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:21.060
There's a kind of paralysis, fear-driven paralysis

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.980
that also in part, some of the most brilliant people

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.580
I know are lost in this paralysis.

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.420
I don't think people have signed a word to it,

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.020
but I think that's a good thing.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.380
I don't think people have signed a word to it,

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.460
but it's almost like a fear of this unknown thing

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:36.900
that lurks in the shadows.

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.620
And that, unfortunately, that fear is leveraged by people

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:47.100
that, you know, who are in academic circles,

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.860
who aren't faculty or students and so on

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.340
or more administration.

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:52.500
And they start to use that fear,

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.260
which makes me quite uncomfortable.

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:59.980
It does lend people in the positions of power

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.060
who are not good at handling that power

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:07.060
to become slowly, day by day, a little bit more corrupt.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.060
I was really trying to figure out, you know,

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:10.660
the last two weeks thinking this through.

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.020
It's like, how do you know?

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.540
Let's say someone asked me a question in the YouTube comment.

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.780
He said, well, why can I trust your advice

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:21.140
on the environmental front?

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.620
And I thought, that's a really good question.

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:26.740
Okay.

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.260
Let's see if we can figure out the principles

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.260
by which the advice would be trustworthy.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.100
Okay.

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.540
How do you know it's not trustworthy?

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:39.540
Well, one potential response to that would be

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.140
the claims are not in accordance with the facts,

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.860
but you know, facts are tricky things

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.420
and it depends on where you look for them.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.700
So that's a tough one to get right because,

01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.340
for example, Lomborg's fundamental critics argue

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:56.140
about his facts, not just his interpretation of them.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.020
So that can't be an unerring guide.

01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:01.780
And so I thought, well, the facts exactly doesn't work

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:05.300
because when it's about everything, there's too many facts.

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:08.860
So then how do you determine if someone's a trustworthy guide

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:11.460
in the face of the apocalyptic unknown?

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.420
Because that's really the question.

01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:17.420
And the answer is they're not terrified tyrants.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.540
I think that's the answer.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.540
Now, maybe that's wrong.

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.980
If someone has a better answer-

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.940
How do you know if they're a terrified tyrant?

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.940
Because they're willing to use compulsion on other people.

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:29.940
When they could use goodwill.

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:32.820
Like the farmers in Canada objected.

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:36.700
They said, look, we have every economic reason

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.220
to use as little fertilizer as we can

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.820
because it's expensive.

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:44.940
We have satellite maps of where we put the fertilizer.

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.060
We have cut our fertilizer use so substantially

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:50.140
in the last 40 years, you can't believe it.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.300
And we grow way more food.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.860
We're already breaking ourselves in half.

01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:56.220
And if you know farmers,

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.940
especially the ones who still survive,

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:00.580
you think those people don't know what they're doing.

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:04.540
It's like, they're pretty damn sophisticated, man.

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:08.820
Like way more sophisticated than our prime minister.

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.900
And now you tell them, no, it's a 30% reduction.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:13.740
And we don't care how much food you're growing.

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:18.220
So it's not a reduction that's dependent

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.740
on amount of food produced per unit of fertilizer used,

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.540
which would be at least you could imagine it.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:27.220
Okay, so you're producing this much food

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:28.780
and use this much fertilizer.

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:30.700
So you're hyper efficient.

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.380
Maybe we take the 10% of farmers

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.060
who are the least efficient in that metric.

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.500
And we say to them, you have to get as efficient

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.780
as the average farmer.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.740
And then they say, well, look, you know,

01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:42.860
our situation is different.

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.660
We're in a more Northern climb.

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.140
The soil's weaker.

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.140
You know, you obviously have to bargain with that,

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:52.140
but at least you reward them for their productivity.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.460
Well, it's like, well, Holland isn't going to have beef.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.260
Well, where are they going to get it?

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.300
Well, you don't need it.

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.180
It's like, oh, I see.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.580
You get to tell me what I can eat now, do you?

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:03.540
Really?

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.500
Okay.

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:08.980
And Holland is going to import food from where

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.620
that's more efficient on the fertilizer front.

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:14.980
There's no one more efficient than Holland.

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.500
Same with Canada.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.140
And like, isn't this going to make food prices

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.540
more expensive?

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:24.140
And doesn't that mean that hungry people die?

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.980
Because that is what it means.

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:28.740
So ultimately poor people pay the price

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.740
of these kinds of policies.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:32.900
Not known, not ultimately.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:35.420
Now.

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.260
Today.

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.620
Today, that's a crucial distinction because they say,

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:40.700
well, ultimately the poor will benefit.

01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.180
Yeah, except the dead ones.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.980
Yes, today.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.300
Today, right.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:50.100
It seems like the story of war too is a time

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:53.940
when the poor people suffer from the decision made

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:58.940
by the powerful, the rich, the political elite.

01:16:59.700 --> 01:17:00.980
Yeah.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.340
Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:04.180
Oh yeah.

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:06.220
I got into plenty of trouble about that too.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:12.220
You're just a man in a suit talking on microphones

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.700
and writing brilliant articles.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:20.740
There's also people dying, fighting.

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.700
It's their land, it's their country, it's their history.

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:26.420
This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:30.180
It's people trying to ask, they have many dragons

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.660
and they're asking themselves the question, who are we?

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.100
What is this?

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.340
What is the future of this nation?

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:41.180
We thought we are a great nation.

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.180
And I think both countries say this.

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.980
And they say, well, how do we become the great nation

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:50.060
we thought we are?

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:50.900
Yeah.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:55.140
And so what, first of all, you got in trouble.

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:58.580
What's the dynamics of the trouble

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.740
and is it something you regret saying?

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.700
No, no, I thought about it a lot.

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.180
I laid out four reasons for the war.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.820
And then I was criticized in the Atlantic

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:12.020
for the argument was reduced to one reason,

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.300
which was a caricature of the reason.

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.260
I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.900
Mismanagement on the part of the West

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:23.540
in relationship to Russia and foreign policy

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.580
over the last, since the wall fell.

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:29.180
It's understandable because it's extremely complex.

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:34.060
Hyper-reliance on Russia as a cardinal source

01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:35.980
of energy provision for Europe

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:39.660
in the wake of idiot environmental globalist utopianism.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:45.500
The expansionist tendencies of Russia

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:48.780
that are analogous in some sense

01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:51.260
to the Soviet Union empire building.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.700
And then the last one,

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.980
which is the one I got in trouble for,

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:58.580
which is Putin's belief or willingness

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.260
to manipulate his people into believing

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:03.900
that Russia is a salvific force

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.900
in the face of idiot Western wokeism.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.460
And that's the one I got in trouble for.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.980
It's like, well, you're justifying Putin.

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:14.780
It's like, it's not only the Russians

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:17.140
that think the West has lost its mind.

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:19.220
The Eastern Europeans think so too.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.220
And do I know that it's like,

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:26.220
well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries this spring

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:30.220
and I talked to 300 political and cultural leaders.

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:31.980
And you might say, well, they were all conservatives.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.300
It's like, actually, no, they weren't.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.140
Most of them were conservatives

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:37.980
because it turns out

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.140
that they're more willing to talk to me.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.260
But a good chunk of them were liberals

01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:46.100
by any stretch of the imagination.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:49.820
And a fair number of them were canceled progressives.

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:51.900
Well, because you're very concerned

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:56.900
about the culture wars that perhaps are a signal

01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:02.380
of a possible bad future for this country

01:20:02.540 --> 01:20:04.300
for this part of the world.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.340
That reason stands out.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:11.340
And do you sort of looking back at four reasons

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:16.340
think it deserves to have a place in one of the four?

01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:17.780
Oh, absolutely.

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:19.580
Because it is, you know.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.220
Well, the four was bifurcated

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:24.340
because I said, look, Putin might believe this.

01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.860
And I actually think he does

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.540
because I read a bunch of Putin's speeches

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.660
and I have been reading them for 15 years.

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.500
And my sense of people generally,

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:32.540
and this was true of Hitler,

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:35.620
it's like, well, what did Hitler believe?

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.900
Well, did you read what he wrote?

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.060
He just did what he said he was going to do.

01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:42.420
And you might think, well, some people are so tricky.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:47.180
They have a whole body of elaborated speech

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:49.860
that's completely separate from their personality

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.780
and their personality is pursuing a different agenda.

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:56.020
And this whole body of speech is nothing but a front.

01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:00.220
It's like, good luck finding someone that sophisticated.

01:21:00.220 --> 01:21:01.980
First of all, if you say things long enough,

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:02.940
you're gonna believe them.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:04.140
That's a really interesting

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.020
and fascinating and important point.

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:09.700
Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda,

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.660
I think Hitler is an example of somebody

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:14.060
that I think really quickly,

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:16.140
you start to believe the propaganda.

01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:19.340
Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:22.900
It's like, don't you become what you practice?

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.940
And the answer to that is, well, absolutely.

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:26.460
We even know the neurology.

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.500
It's like when you first formulate a concept,

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:32.100
huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so to speak.

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.260
But as you practice that,

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:36.780
first of all, the right hemisphere stops participating

01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:40.700
and then the left participates less and less

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.980
until you build specialized machinery

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.900
for exactly that conceptual frame.

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:49.140
And then you start to see it, not just think it.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.420
And so if you're telling the same lies over and over,

01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:53.700
who do you think you're fooling?

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.500
Think, well, I can withstand my own lies.

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.460
Not if they're effective lies.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.460
And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.500
and then they reflect them back to you,

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.660
what makes you think you're going to be able

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.260
to withstand that?

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:09.100
You aren't.

01:22:09.100 --> 01:22:11.340
And so I do think Putin believes,

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:14.700
to the degree that he believes anything,

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.300
I do believe that he thinks of himself

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.780
as a bulwark for Christendom

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:23.580
against the degeneration of the West.

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:26.700
And that's that third way that Dugan and Putin

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.420
have been talking about the philosopher Alexander Dugan

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.100
and Putin for 15 years.

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:34.620
Now, what that is, is very amorphous.

01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:38.300
Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians would have to return

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.700
to the incremental development of orthodox Christianity

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.060
to escape from the communist trap.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.940
And to some degree that's happened in Russia

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:49.540
because there's been a return to orthodox Christianity.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:50.700
Now you could say, yeah,

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:54.020
but the orthodox church has just been co-opted by the state.

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:56.060
And I would say there's some evidence for that.

01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:01.060
I've heard, for example, that the metropolitan owns,

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.260
now I don't know if this is true,

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:06.380
owns $5 billion worth of personal property.

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:09.100
And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.740
And it's possible that the orthodox church

01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:12.940
has been co-opted,

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:16.500
but there has been somewhat of an orthodox revival in Russia

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.620
and I don't think that's all bad.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.580
Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this,

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.260
if he's just a psychopathic manipulator,

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:29.260
and unfortunately, I don't think that's true.

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:30.700
I've read his speeches.

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.500
It doesn't look like it to me.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.860
And he is by no means the worst Russian leader

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:36.220
of the last hundred years.

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.420
Well, there's quite a selection there.

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.700
There certainly is, but, and I say that knowing that,

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:46.940
even if he doesn't believe it,

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.540
he's convinced his people that it's true.

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:56.580
And so we're stuck with the claim in either case.

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.900
And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:04.900
Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.140
And a lot of people have reached out to me,

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:11.900
experts telling me how I should feel,

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.060
what I should think about Ukraine.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:18.420
Oh, you naive, Lex, you're so naive.

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.420
Here's how it really is.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:24.140
But then I get to see people that lost their home.

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:26.860
I get to see people on the Russian side

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.300
who believe they're,

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:31.100
I genuinely think that there's some degree

01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.820
to which they have love in their heart.

01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:38.820
They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:41.420
How else would you motivate young men to go fight?

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:44.100
It's just, it's these humans

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:47.540
destroying not only their homes,

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.620
but creating generational hate,

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:52.820
destroying the possibility of love towards each other.

01:24:52.820 --> 01:24:54.780
They're basically creating hate.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:59.580
What I've heard a lot of is on February 24th of this year,

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:04.300
hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.740
Hate towards not Vladimir Putin,

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.420
hate towards not the soldiers in Russia,

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.060
but hate towards all Russians.

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:15.340
Hate that will last generations.

01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:20.340
And then you can see just the pain there.

01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:26.940
And then when all these experts talk about

01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:35.100
agriculture and energy and geopolitics,

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.820
and yeah, maybe like what you say

01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:41.380
with fighting the ideologies of the woke and so on,

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:45.660
I just feel like it's missing something deep

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:47.780
that war is not fought

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:52.500
about any of those things.

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.340
War started and war is averted

01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:58.860
based on human beings, based on humanity.

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.820
Here's another ugly thought

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.820
since we haven't had enough so far.

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.700
We locked everything down for COVID.

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.380
How much face-to-face communication

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:13.020
was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.460
How about none?

01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.980
How about that was the wrong amount?

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:19.380
Especially given that Europe was completely dependent

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:21.140
on Putin for its energy supplies.

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.540
Well, not completely, but you know what I mean.

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.940
Materially and significantly.

01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:28.660
So maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:31.780
Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble, probably.

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.260
And not just an information bubble

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.380
how all these experts tell me about.

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.060
Yeah, no, a human bubble.

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:39.220
Human bubble.

01:26:39.220 --> 01:26:41.260
Look, one of the things I've really learned.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.220
There's a real emphasis on hospitality

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:44.300
in the Old Testament.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.980
I just brought all these scholars together

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.580
to talk about Exodus.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.860
I have this security team with me

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:53.740
and they're tough military guys

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:57.140
but they're on board for this mission, let's say.

01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:58.620
And so they went out of their way

01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:01.420
to be hospitable to my academic guests.

01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:03.300
They laid out nice platters of meat

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:04.340
and cheese and crackers.

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:07.260
They spent all day preparing this house I had rented

01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.020
so that we could have a hospitable time

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:09.860
with these scholars.

01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:11.140
Most of whom I didn't know well,

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:13.460
but who said they would come and spend eight days

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:15.420
talking about this book with me.

01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:16.700
We rented some jet skis.

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.060
We had a nice house.

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:21.380
We had fun and we got to know each other

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:22.820
and we got to trust each other

01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:24.620
because we could see that we could have some fun

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.380
and that we could let our hair down a bit.

01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:27.860
We didn't have to be on guard.

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.780
And that made the talks way deeper.

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:33.660
And then we found out we couldn't get through Exodus

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:34.500
in eight days.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.420
So I had proposed very early on

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.780
that we're gonna double the length.

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.500
And so I pulled eight people out of their lives

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.900
for eight days.

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.940
That's not an easy thing to do.

01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:46.300
It's also quite expensive.

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.100
And the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:51.940
And they said, yes, right away.

01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:53.900
So we'd love to do this again.

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:54.940
Well, why?

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:57.460
Well, partly because intellectually

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.740
it was unbelievably engaging.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.580
I learned so much.

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.540
It'll take me like a year to digest it

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.980
if I can ever digest it.

01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:08.420
But they had a really good time.

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.020
And so when they were offered that combination

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:14.420
of intellectual challenge, let's say in hospitality,

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:15.540
it was a no brainer.

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.660
They just said, every one of them said,

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:20.340
if I can do it in any way, I will definitely be there.

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:24.060
And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:26.140
and the culture of hospitality

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.260
has broken down in Washington.

01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.620
40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.140
They don't have apartments.

01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:35.140
Their family isn't there with them.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:37.620
They don't have social occasions

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:40.460
with their fellow Democrats or Republicans,

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.060
much less across the table.

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:46.020
And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:48.460
that were bilateral a couple of times,

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:50.500
get young Republican congressmen

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.580
and Democrats together to talk.

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:54.020
And as soon as they talk, they think,

01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:55.980
oh, it was so interesting.

01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.180
Cause one of the lunches was about 15 people,

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.300
half Democrats and half Republicans.

01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:03.860
And all I'd ask them to do was just spend three minutes

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.380
talking about why you decided to become a congressman,

01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:08.540
which is not a job I would take by the way.

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:12.940
You spend 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.

01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:14.900
Your family isn't there with you.

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:17.740
You have to run for reelection every two years.

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:20.700
You're beholden to the party apparatus, right?

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.620
You're vilified constantly.

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:25.100
This is not, you know, people think,

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.860
well, this is a job for the privileged.

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:29.740
It's like, yeah, you go and run for Congress

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.980
and find out how much fun it is

01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:32.140
to put your family on the line

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.260
and then have to beg for your job every two years

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:37.100
while your enemies, the worst of your enemies

01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:38.420
and the worst of your friends

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:41.340
are viciously henpecking you.

01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:43.540
And so anyways, we had them all sit around a table,

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:47.740
said, okay, just say why you ran for Congress.

01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:49.500
It was so cool, especially for a Canadian

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.700
cause you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.100
It's something to watch.

01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:56.140
It was like Mr. Smith goes to Washington

01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:56.980
for every one of them.

01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:59.180
It's like, well, this country has given us so much

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:02.140
where our families have been so,

01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:05.340
we've benefited so much from our time here.

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.820
We think this is a wonderful country.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:09.220
We really felt that we should give back.

01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:10.540
And the next one would talk

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.220
and it was like exactly the same story.

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:13.500
And then it didn't matter

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.780
if they were Republican or Democrat.

01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:15.780
You couldn't tell the difference.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:16.940
No one could.

01:30:16.940 --> 01:30:17.940
And was it genuine?

01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.260
It's like, well, are you genuine?

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:23.140
You think these people are worse than you?

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.260
First of all, they're not.

01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.700
Second of all, they're probably better,

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.220
all things considered.

01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.780
It's not that easy to become a congressman.

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.220
And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch,

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:37.020
but by and large, you walk away from your meetings

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.580
with these people and you think,

01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.060
pretty impressive.

01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:44.180
They really are giving a part of themselves

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:45.540
in the name of service.

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:48.180
Maybe over time, they become cynical

01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:52.780
and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.140
But I think a lot of it-

01:30:54.140 --> 01:30:55.580
Could you imagine that?

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.300
Is healed, I think.

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.060
And I don't think I'm, well, I'm in part naive,

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:02.380
but not fully.

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:03.940
That a lot of it is healed

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:05.540
through the power of conversation,

01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:08.220
just basic social interaction.

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:09.740
I do think that the-

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:10.580
You bet, man.

01:31:10.580 --> 01:31:11.980
The effects of this pandemic-

01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:13.980
Especially by listening.

01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:15.500
Listen, just sitting there.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:18.020
And it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.660
It's actually humor and all those kinds of things

01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.980
about personal struggles,

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:26.300
all those kinds of things that remind you

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.660
that you're all just humans.

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.500
Yeah.

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:31.540
Well, the great leaders that I've met,

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:32.740
and I've met some now,

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.140
they go listen to their constituents.

01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.420
It's not a policy discussion.

01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:38.700
It's not an ideology discussion.

01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:42.300
They go say, okay, what's your life like

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.620
and what are your problems?

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:45.780
And tell me about them.

01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.980
And then they listen and then they're struck by them.

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.740
And then they gather up all that misery

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.300
and they bring it to the congressional office

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:53.220
or to the parliament.

01:31:53.220 --> 01:31:57.620
And they think, here's what the people are crying out for.

01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:00.580
And the good leaders, that's a leader.

01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.500
Leader listens.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:06.820
So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:11.820
And he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour,

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:13.140
being funny.

01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:14.340
That's hard.

01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:17.420
He said, comedy is the most stand-up comedy,

01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.820
which is what I do in some real sense.

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:23.420
It's a thing I do that it's most akin

01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.780
to what I'm doing on my book tours, I would say.

01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:27.420
It's the closest analog.

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.780
He said, it's the most dialogical enterprise.

01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:32.340
And I thought, well, why, what do you mean?

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.180
Because see, it's just the monologue

01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.220
and it's a prepared monologue.

01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:39.140
I mean, you have to interact dynamically

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:40.940
with the audience while you're telling your jokes

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.020
and you gotta get the timing right.

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:44.660
But you have a body of jokes.

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:47.140
He said, well, here's how you prepare the jokes.

01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.460
And I've been told this by other comedians.

01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.620
You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour

01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:55.300
and you got some new material and you think it's funny.

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:58.580
And you go into a club and you lay out your new material

01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.540
and people laugh at some of it.

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:04.540
And you pay attention to what they laugh at

01:33:04.540 --> 01:33:06.380
and what they don't laugh at.

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:09.060
So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:11.380
and you get rid of everything that isn't funny.

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.540
And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny,

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:17.180
the crowd will tell you what's funny.

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:20.020
So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows

01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:22.340
and each is an hour long and you collect two minutes

01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:24.460
of humor from each show.

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:27.940
So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:31.820
more than 98% of it, collect two minutes per show.

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:34.220
So you're not very funny at all.

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:35.860
You're like funny 2% of the time.

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:38.820
You aggregate that, man, you're a scream.

01:33:38.820 --> 01:33:41.420
So that's what a leader does.

01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.140
That is what a leader does is goes out

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:46.900
and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:48.940
And then I do think that's revivifying

01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:52.140
to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.620
because then the person can say to themselves,

01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:58.740
despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies,

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:02.580
I'm gathering up the misery and the hope

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:06.540
and I'm bringing it forward where it can be redressed.

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.540
Giving it a voice.

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.420
Yep, giving it, that's right, giving it a voice.

01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:10.860
Can you actually take me through a day

01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:14.620
because this is fascinating, through your comedy tour,

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:19.380
what is a day in the life of Jordan Peterson look like?

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.420
Which is this very interesting day.

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:25.580
Let's look at the day when you have to speak,

01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.100
preparing your mind,

01:34:27.100 --> 01:34:29.940
thinking of what you're going to talk about,

01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:33.540
preparing yourself physically and mentally

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:37.140
to interact with the crowd through the actual speaking.

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:39.660
How do you adjust what you're thinking through

01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:41.620
and how do you come down from that?

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:46.540
So you can start all again as a limited biological system.

01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:51.300
Well, I'm usually up by seven

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:55.660
and ready to go by 7.30 or eight.

01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.820
Coffee?

01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:00.460
No, steak and water.

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:02.460
How many times a day steak?

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:03.780
All, that's all I eat.

01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:05.060
How many times?

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:07.220
Three or four, depending on the day.

01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:08.060
Steak and water.

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:09.500
Steak and sparkling water.

01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:13.820
Yeah, so monastic asceticism, man.

01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:16.940
Well, I did the proper, I usually just once a day,

01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:19.420
I did the proper Jordan Peterson last night

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:20.620
and just ate two steaks.

01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:21.900
And how was that?

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.140
It was wonderful.

01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:25.500
Yeah, well, if you have to only eat one thing,

01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:27.780
could be worse.

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.660
So anyways, I'm ready to go at eight

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:31.220
because we're generally moving.

01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:33.340
What does moving mean?

01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:34.580
Flying, you're constantly-

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:35.940
Flying somewhere.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:36.780
Okay.

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:38.860
And we usually use private flights now

01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:41.580
because the commercial airlines aren't reliable enough

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:44.740
and you cannot not make a venue, right?

01:35:44.740 --> 01:35:46.540
So that's rule number one on a tour.

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:48.860
You make the show.

01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.020
So everything, and then number, rule number two is

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:56.700
anybody who causes any trouble on the tour is gone

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:59.340
because there is zero room for error.

01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:04.260
Now, no, there's zero room for unnecessary,

01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:05.260
unaddressed error.

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:06.540
So there's gonna be errors.

01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:08.100
The guys I have around me now,

01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:12.060
if they make a mistake, they fix it right away.

01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:13.660
So, and that's great.

01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:15.820
There's a lot of people relying on you to be there.

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:16.660
So you have to be there.

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:19.900
Yeah, like 4,000 people typically.

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:24.900
So then I'm on the plane and I usually write or often

01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:31.140
because there's no internet on the plane

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:32.500
and that's a good use of time.

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:33.780
So I'm writing a new book.

01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:34.860
So I write on the plane.

01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.260
Typing or handwriting?

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:38.980
Typing, yeah, typing.

01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:43.620
And then we land and we go to,

01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.060
it's usually early afternoon by then.

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:47.380
We go to a hotel.

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:48.860
It's usually a nice hotel.

01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:49.700
It's not corporate.

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:51.500
I don't really like corporate hotels.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.740
My secretary and one of my logistics guys

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:59.220
has got quite good at picking kind of adventurous hotels,

01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:00.260
boutique hotels.

01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.740
They're usually in the old parts of the city,

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.020
especially in Europe, somewhere interesting.

01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:08.940
And so we go there and then lunch usually.

01:37:08.940 --> 01:37:11.060
And sometimes that's an air fryer

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.420
and a steak in the hotel room.

01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:14.500
And I leave a trail of air fryers behind me

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:15.980
all across the world.

01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:19.980
And then Tammy and I usually go out

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:22.580
and have a walk or something and take a look at the city.

01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:25.140
And then I have a rest for like an hour and a half

01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.340
or an hour, half an hour.

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:27.180
Like a nap or just?

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:28.020
Yeah, nap.

01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.420
I have to sleep for 20 minutes.

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:30.460
And that's about all I can sleep,

01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:31.780
but I need to do that in the late afternoon.

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:32.940
That refreshes your mind.

01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:36.420
Yeah, that wakes me up again for the evening.

01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.300
And then Tam has to sleep longer.

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:40.180
She's still recovering from her illness.

01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.540
And so she has to sleep longer in the afternoon.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.420
And that's absolutely necessary for both of us

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:46.580
or things start to get frayed.

01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:48.900
And so then we go to the venue

01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:54.700
and then I usually sit for an hour.

01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:55.620
If I'm going to lecture,

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:56.980
I've been doing a lot of Q and A's

01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:57.900
and that's a little easier.

01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:58.940
But if I'm going to lecture,

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:01.100
I have to sit for an hour.

01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.340
And then I think, okay,

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:07.620
what question am I trying to investigate?

01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:09.700
I have to have that, so that's the point.

01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:13.140
What mystery am I trying to unravel?

01:38:13.140 --> 01:38:15.620
It's usually associated with one of the rules in my book

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.700
because technically it's a book tour,

01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:21.700
but each of those rules is an investigation into an ethic.

01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:24.580
And each of them points to a deeper sort of mystery

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.420
in some sense.

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:28.820
And there's no end to the amount that can be explored.

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.820
And so I have the question,

01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:36.060
my question might be something like put your house

01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:38.420
in perfect order before you criticize the world.

01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:40.780
Okay, what does that mean exactly?

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:42.300
What does house mean?

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:46.780
What does put mean, that active verb?

01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:48.980
What does perfect and order mean?

01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:51.260
Why before you criticize the world?

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:52.900
What does it mean to criticize?

01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:54.700
What does it mean to criticize the world?

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:56.860
How can you do that properly or improperly?

01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:59.340
So I start to think about how to decompose the question.

01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:02.180
And you start to think which of these decompositions

01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.780
are important to really dig into?

01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.060
Yeah, well, then they'll strike me.

01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:06.460
It's like, okay, there's something there

01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:09.100
that I've been maybe noodling around on

01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.140
that I would like to investigate further.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.700
Then I think, okay, how can I approach this problem?

01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:16.220
I think, well, I have this story that I know,

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:17.900
I have this story and I have this story,

01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:19.860
but I haven't juxtaposed them before.

01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:21.940
And there's gonna be some interesting interaction

01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.460
in the juxtaposition.

01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:24.820
So I have the question

01:39:24.820 --> 01:39:27.540
and I kind of have a framework of interpretation.

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:31.100
And then I have some potential narrative places I can go.

01:39:31.100 --> 01:39:33.340
And then I think, okay, I can go juggle that

01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:35.140
and see what happens.

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:38.860
And so then what I wanna do is concentrate on that process

01:39:38.860 --> 01:39:40.380
while attending to the audience

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:42.540
to make sure that the words are landing

01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:45.060
and then see if I can delve into it deeply enough

01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:50.060
so that a narrative emerges spontaneously with an ending.

01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:53.420
Now, I'm sure you've experienced this in podcasts, right?

01:39:53.420 --> 01:39:56.140
Maybe I'm wrong, but my experience has been

01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:58.420
if I fall into the conversation

01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:00.820
and we know about the timeframe,

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:03.660
there'll be a natural narrative arc.

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.180
And then, so you'll kind of know when the midpoint is

01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.060
and you'll kind of see when you're reaching a conclusion.

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:09.380
And then if you really pay attention,

01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.060
you can see that's a good place to stop.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.340
And it's kind of, you come to a point

01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:20.220
and you have to be alert and patient to see that.

01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.340
And you have to be willing to be satisfied

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:24.180
with where you've got to.

01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:26.700
But if you do that, and then it's like a comedian

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:28.740
making the punchline work.

01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.260
It's like, I've got all these balls in the air

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:33.820
and they're going somewhere

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:36.380
and this is how they come together.

01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:37.700
And people love that, right?

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.140
They say, oh, this and this and this and this and this,

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:42.700
whack, together.

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.660
And that's an insight.

01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:45.980
And it is very much like a punchline.

01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:47.820
Well, that's interesting because your mind,

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:49.900
actually, I'm a fan of your podcast too,

01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:53.420
and you are always driving towards that.

01:40:53.460 --> 01:40:57.100
I would say for me in a podcast conversation,

01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:00.740
there's often a kind of Alice in Wonderland

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:02.300
type of exploration.

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:03.580
Down the rabbit hole, man.

01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:06.220
And then you just, a new thing pops up.

01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:08.860
The more absurd, the wilder, the better.

01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:10.900
Conversations with Elon are like this.

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:14.220
It's like, actually, the more you drive towards an arc,

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.340
the more uncomfortable you start to get

01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:18.820
in a fun, absurd conversation

01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:22.460
because, oh, I'm now one of the normies.

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:23.500
No, I don't want that.

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.740
I want to be, I want the rabbit.

01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:29.780
I want the crazy because it makes it more fun.

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:33.780
But somehow, throughout it, there is wisdom

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:37.540
that you try to grasp at such that there is a thread.

01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:38.620
Well, that's the thing, man.

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.380
You're following the thread, eh?

01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:42.060
Yeah, you try.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.020
Well, that's right.

01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.540
That's what we're trying to do, that thread.

01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:47.260
That thread is the proper balance

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:49.140
between structure and spontaneity.

01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:52.220
And it manifests itself as the instinctive meaning.

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.780
And that's the logos in the dialogus.

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.020
And it really is the logos.

01:41:56.020 --> 01:41:57.780
And God only knows what that means.

01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:01.140
You know, I mean, the biblical claim is that logos

01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:03.780
is the fundamental principle of reality.

01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:05.740
And I think that's true.

01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.940
I actually think that's true

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:10.620
because I think that that meaning that guides you,

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:11.860
well, here's a way of thinking about it.

01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:14.260
I've been writing about this recently.

01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:15.180
What's real?

01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:17.140
Matter.

01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:19.260
It's like, okay, that's one answer.

01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.140
What's real?

01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:23.180
What matters is real.

01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:24.980
That's how you act.

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:26.780
Okay, that's different than matter.

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:31.700
It's like, okay, what's the most real of what matters?

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.660
How about pain?

01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:36.420
Why is it the most real?

01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:38.020
Try arguing it away.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.140
Good luck.

01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.980
So pain is the fundamental reality.

01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:44.820
All right.

01:42:45.860 --> 01:42:47.700
Well, that's rough.

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:50.060
Doesn't that lead to nihilism and hopelessness?

01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:52.020
Yeah.

01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:53.820
Doesn't it lead to a philosophy

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.820
that's antithetical towards being

01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.700
the most fundamental reality is pain?

01:42:58.700 --> 01:42:59.780
Yes.

01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:01.980
Is there anything more fundamental than pain?

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:04.500
Love.

01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:07.380
Really?

01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:09.460
If you're in pain,

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:14.900
love and truth,

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.780
that's what you got.

01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:18.620
And you know,

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:26.380
if they're more powerful than pain,

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:28.140
maybe they're the most real things.

01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:32.380
When you think about reality,

01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:35.740
what is real that is the most real thing?

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.100
Well, it's a tough one, right?

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.740
Because you have to,

01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:41.540
because if you're a scientist, a materialist, think well,

01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:43.820
the matter is the most real.

01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:46.220
It's like, well, you don't know what the matter is.

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:47.060
Yeah.

01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:50.140
And so, and then when push comes to shove and it will,

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.980
you'll find out what's most real.

01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.820
Yeah.

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:58.300
I feel like this is missing,

01:43:58.300 --> 01:44:02.460
the physical reality is missing some of the things.

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:04.940
So of course, pain has a biological component

01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:05.780
and all those kinds of things,

01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:09.660
but it's missing something deep about the human condition

01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:15.260
that at least the modern science is not able to describe,

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:17.260
but it is reaching towards that.

01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:18.100
Yeah, it is.

01:44:18.100 --> 01:44:19.860
And it's the reason,

01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:22.020
one way to describe it as you're describing

01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:23.700
is the reason it's reaching it

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:27.380
is because underneath of science is this assumption

01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:29.460
that there's a deep-

01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:31.980
Logos.

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:34.780
Thing to this whole thing we're trying to do.

01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:36.580
Well, you know, there's two traditions, right?

01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:39.540
In some sense, there's two logos traditions.

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:44.340
There's the Greek rational enlightenment tradition.

01:44:44.340 --> 01:44:45.820
That's a logos tradition.

01:44:45.820 --> 01:44:48.460
And it insists that there's a logos in nature

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.660
and that science is the way to approach it.

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.540
And then there's the Judeo-Christian logos,

01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:55.100
which is more embodied and more spiritual.

01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:57.180
And I would say the West is actually an attempt

01:44:57.180 --> 01:44:59.020
to unite those two.

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:01.620
And it's the proper attempt to unite those two

01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:04.900
because they need to be united.

01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:07.500
And I see the union coming in your terms.

01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:09.700
I talked to Franz de Waal, for example,

01:45:09.700 --> 01:45:13.380
about the animating principle of chimpanzee sovereignty.

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.260
And that's pretty close biologically.

01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:16.820
Is it power?

01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:19.380
Because that's the claim even from the biologists often,

01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:23.660
the most dominant chimp has the best reproductive success.

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:26.820
It's like, oh yeah, dominant, hey?

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.340
You mean using compulsion?

01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:29.940
Okay, let's look.

01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:34.620
Are the chimps who use compulsion the most successful?

01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:39.100
And the answer is sporadically and rarely,

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:41.460
and for short, well, that's sporadically,

01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:43.020
for short periods of time.

01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:44.100
Why?

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.700
Because they meet an unpleasant end.

01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:52.420
The subordinates over whom they exercise arbitrary control

01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:56.940
wait for a weak moment and then tear them into shreds, right?

01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:59.340
Every dictator's terror.

01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:00.540
And for good reason.

01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:04.460
And de Waal has showed that the alpha chimps, the males,

01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:07.380
who do have preferential mating access often,

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:12.100
are often and reliably the best peacemakers

01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:14.180
and the most reciprocal.

01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.660
And so even among chimps, the principle of sovereignty

01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:21.660
is something like iterative, iterated reciprocity.

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:26.860
And that's a way better principle than power.

01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:28.780
And it's something like, I've been thinking,

01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:31.660
what's the antithesis of the spirit of power?

01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.540
I think it's the spirit of play.

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:37.460
And you know, I don't know what you think about that,

01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:39.620
but when you have a good podcast conversation,

01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:41.900
you already described it in some sense as play.

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.420
It's like there's a structure, right?

01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:45.940
Because it's an ordered conversation,

01:46:45.940 --> 01:46:48.140
but you want there to be play in the system.

01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:51.340
And if you get that right, then it's really engaging.

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:54.860
And then it seems to have its own narrative arc.

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:56.060
I'm not trying to impose that,

01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:58.140
even though that's another thing I don't do.

01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:00.860
I didn't come to this conversation at all,

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:03.220
thinking here's what I want out of a conversation

01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:06.060
with Lex Fridman, like instrumentally.

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:08.860
I thought, I'll go talk to Lex.

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:09.700
Why?

01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:13.140
I like his podcasts.

01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:14.500
He's doing something right.

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:15.820
I don't know what it is.

01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:17.940
He asks interesting questions.

01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:19.780
I'll go have a conversation with him.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:20.900
Where's it gonna go?

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.460
Wherever it goes.

01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:26.340
Embracing the spirit of play.

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:30.020
So you have this, when you're lecturing,

01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:32.060
you're going in front of the crowd,

01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:33.740
you're thought of a question.

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.420
You get on the stage.

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:38.340
First of all, are you nervous at all?

01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:43.100
I'm very nervous when I'm sitting down,

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:46.060
thinking through the structure initially,

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:49.060
which is why my wife and I have been doing Q&As

01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:50.220
and that's easier on me.

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:54.500
Yeah, it's the way comedians are nervous,

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:59.220
like Joe Rogan just did his special this weekend.

01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:03.820
And so he now has to sit nervously like a comedian does,

01:48:03.820 --> 01:48:07.020
which is like, I have no material now.

01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:07.860
Right.

01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:08.700
I have to start from scratch.

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:10.780
When I was doing the lectures constantly

01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:13.420
instead of the Q&As,

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:14.820
basically what I was doing

01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:17.780
was writing a whole book chapter every night.

01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:20.300
And now that's a bit of an exaggeration

01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:22.660
because I would return to themes that I had developed,

01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.500
but it's not really an exaggeration

01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:29.500
because I didn't ever just go over rote material, ever.

01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:34.540
So it's very demanding and that part's nerve wracking

01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:36.420
because I sit down, it's an hour before the show

01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:41.020
and I think, can I do this?

01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:45.020
And the answer is, well, you did it a thousand times,

01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:46.860
but that's not this time.

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.140
It's like, can I come up with a question?

01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.260
Can I think through the structure?

01:48:51.260 --> 01:48:56.140
Can I pull off the spontaneous narrative?

01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:57.420
Can I pull it together?

01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:00.060
And the answer is, I don't know.

01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:02.660
And so then I get it together in my mind, I think,

01:49:02.660 --> 01:49:05.780
and that's hard, it takes effort and it's nerve wracking.

01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:07.700
Okay, I got it.

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:09.660
But then there's the moment you go out on stage

01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:13.420
and you think, well, I know I had it, but can I do it?

01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:15.140
No notes.

01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:16.340
And then the question is,

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:18.820
well, you're gonna find out while you do it.

01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:21.060
And so then I go out on stage

01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:24.420
and I don't talk to the audience.

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:26.620
I talk to one person at a time.

01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:29.580
And you can talk to one person,

01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:30.540
because you know how to do that.

01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:32.420
So I talk to a person and not too long

01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:33.860
because I don't wanna make them too nervous

01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:35.940
and then someone else and someone else.

01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.980
And then I'm in contact with the audience

01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:41.100
and then I can tell if the words are landing

01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.660
and I listen, it's like, are they wrestling around?

01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:46.100
Are they dead quiet?

01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:47.660
Because you want dead quiet.

01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:49.380
Oh, I see.

01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:51.100
That's what focus sounds like.

01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:53.460
That you're in it together then.

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.300
You bet.

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:55.660
Well, and I also, here's a good rule

01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.700
if you're learning to speak publicly.

01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:02.700
I never say a word till everyone is 100% quiet.

01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:06.660
And that's a great way to start a talk

01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:08.940
because you're set in the frame,

01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:11.580
and if the frame is, well, I'll talk while you're talking,

01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:14.420
the message is, well, you can talk.

01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:16.180
This is a place where everybody can talk.

01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:17.860
It's like, no, it's not.

01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:21.180
This is a place where people paid to hear me talk.

01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:24.020
So I'm not gonna talk till everyone's listening.

01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:26.980
And so then you get that stillness

01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:28.140
and then you just wait

01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:30.820
because that stillness turns into an expectation.

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:34.420
And then it turns into a kind of nervous expectations.

01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:35.940
Like, what the hell is he doing?

01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:37.140
It's not manipulative.

01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:38.700
It's a sense of timing.

01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:41.060
It's like, just when that's right, you think,

01:50:41.060 --> 01:50:42.940
okay, now it's time to start.

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:45.980
Well, the interesting thing about that nervous expectation

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:49.780
is from an audience perspective, we're in it together.

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:53.100
I mean, to that silence, there's a togetherness to it.

01:50:53.100 --> 01:50:56.020
Of course, it's the union of everyone's attention.

01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:58.460
Yeah, and that's a great thing.

01:50:58.460 --> 01:51:00.700
I mean, you love that at a concert when everyone,

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:01.700
it's not silence then,

01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:03.900
but when everyone's attention is unified

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.260
and everyone's moving in unison,

01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:08.940
it's like we're all worshiping the same thing, right?

01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:11.460
And that would be the point of the conversation,

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:13.660
the point of the lecture.

01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:16.620
And the worship is the direction of attention towards it.

01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:19.220
And it's communion because everyone's doing it

01:51:19.220 --> 01:51:20.620
at the same time.

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:23.260
And so, I mean, there's not much difference

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.620
between a lecture theater and a church in that regard, right?

01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:28.460
It's the same fundamental layout and structure.

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:30.940
And they're very integrally associated with one another.

01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:32.220
One really grew out of the other.

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.340
The lecture theater grew out of the church.

01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:36.300
So it's perfectly reasonable

01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:38.540
to be thinking about it in those terms.

01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:42.180
And so, and then, okay, so after the lecture,

01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:45.580
we play a piece of music that is a piece of music

01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:47.980
that I've been producing with some musicians

01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:51.020
for a couple of books I'm gonna release in the fall.

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:54.580
Terrible books, ABC of Childhood Tragedy, they're called.

01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:59.580
Dark, dark books, dark and comical books.

01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:05.260
Terrible books, but heartbreaking illustrations.

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:09.420
We set them to music, and so we play a piece from that.

01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:13.580
And then afterwards, I usually meet about 150 people

01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:14.540
to have photographs.

01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:17.220
And so, each of those is a little.

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:19.980
Is there a little sparkle of a human connection?

01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:22.500
It's a lot, a lot.

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:26.460
It's very intense, 10 seconds with every person.

01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:28.620
You think, well, how can 10 seconds be intense?

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:31.860
It's like, pay enough attention.

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:33.260
It gets intense real quick.

01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:36.900
Does it break your heart to say goodbye so many times?

01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:39.220
It's like being in a wedding lineup.

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.180
At a wedding that you wanna be at.

01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:42.820
And everybody's dressed up.

01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:43.780
And that's so weird, eh?

01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:45.300
Because I bought these expensive suits

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:47.660
when I went on tour, and it broke my heart

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:48.940
because I spent so much money on them.

01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:51.380
I thought, God, that's completely unconscionable.

01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:53.420
I thought, no way, man.

01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:55.460
I'm in this 100%.

01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:58.780
And so, I'm gonna dress with respect.

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:03.780
And like 60% of the audience comes in

01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:05.900
two or three piece suits.

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.460
They're all dressed up.

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:09.300
Then there's this line to greet me,

01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:11.260
and they're all happy to see me.

01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.460
That's not so hard to take,

01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:15.100
although it is in a sense, right?

01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:19.060
Because normal interactions are pretty shallow.

01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:21.060
And you think, I don't want shallow interactions.

01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.900
It's like, yes, you do most of the time.

01:53:22.900 --> 01:53:24.540
Yeah, it's intense.

01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:25.740
It's very intense.

01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:26.580
And I don't know if you have.

01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:28.340
But you've had a taste of this, no doubt,

01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:29.180
because people recognize you.

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:33.340
Yeah, but I also have, when a person recognizes me

01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.540
and they come with the love,

01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:37.420
and they're often brilliant people,

01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:39.900
one of the thoughts I have to deal with,

01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:42.500
one of the dragons in my own mind is,

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.380
you know, thinking that I don't deserve

01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:45.900
that kind of attention.

01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:46.740
And so.

01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:48.260
Well, you probably don't.

01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:49.100
Right.

01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:50.940
But maybe you could.

01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:53.100
It's a burden in that I have to step up

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:56.300
to be the kind of person that deserves that,

01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:57.900
not deserves that, but in part,

01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:59.140
deserves that kind of attention.

01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:01.380
And that's like, holy shit.

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:02.620
It's crucially important too,

01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:05.220
because if someone comes up to you in an airport

01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:06.140
and they know who you are,

01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:09.020
and they're brave enough to admire you

01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:11.260
or who you are attempting to be,

01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:16.260
and you make a mistake, they will never forget it.

01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:19.380
So it's a high stakes enterprise.

01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:20.820
And the flip side of that,

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:23.220
especially with young people,

01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:24.900
a few words you can say can change

01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:26.460
the direction of their life.

01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:28.180
One way or another.

01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:30.340
And so I really have to watch this too in airports,

01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:31.700
because I do not like airports.

01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:34.620
I do not like the creeping totalitarianism in airports.

01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:35.820
They've always bothered me.

01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:36.660
Yes.

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.380
They really bother me.

01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:40.300
And I'm an unpleasant travel companion

01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:42.020
for my wife sometimes because of that.

01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:44.100
Although I think we've worked that out, thank God,

01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:46.420
because we're doing a lot of traveling.

01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:50.900
But most of the security guards and the border personnel,

01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:52.300
all those people, they know me.

01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:54.020
And as a general rule,

01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:55.660
they're positively predisposed to me.

01:54:55.660 --> 01:54:57.740
And so if I'm peevish or irritable,

01:54:58.740 --> 01:54:59.580
Yeah.

01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:02.300
Then, well, that's not good.

01:55:02.300 --> 01:55:03.460
It's not good.

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:05.180
And so that's a tight rope to walk too,

01:55:05.180 --> 01:55:08.540
because I do not like that creeping totalitarianism.

01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:09.900
But by the same token,

01:55:11.180 --> 01:55:13.740
you know, if you're just one of the crowd,

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:17.220
just, you know, sometimes it's good

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:18.300
just to be one of the crowd,

01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:19.460
and then you're a little irritable

01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:21.020
and people can just brush that off.

01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:26.020
But if you're someone they have dared to open their heart to,

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:28.060
because that's what admiration is,

01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:32.260
and then you betray that,

01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:35.700
then that's a real, they'll never forget it.

01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:38.140
And then they'll tell everyone too.

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:41.140
So it takes a lot of alertness.

01:55:41.140 --> 01:55:43.380
And so Tammy and our life has got complicated today,

01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:45.420
because in Toronto, for example,

01:55:45.420 --> 01:55:48.340
we can't really just go for a walk.

01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:50.820
It's always a high drama production,

01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:52.540
because always people come up

01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:56.020
and they have some heart rending story to tell.

01:55:56.020 --> 01:55:58.020
And I'm not being cynical about that.

01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:59.340
Yes.

01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:01.980
It's a hard thing to bear,

01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:03.740
because people don't do that.

01:56:03.740 --> 01:56:05.900
They don't just open themselves up to you like that

01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:07.660
and share the tragedy of their life.

01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:12.620
But that's an everyday occurrence.

01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:14.540
And so when we go up to our cottage,

01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:18.140
which is out of the city, it's a relief, you know,

01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:22.300
because as wonderful as that is,

01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:25.300
I have a weird life because everywhere I go,

01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:26.620
it's very weird.

01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:29.140
It's like I'm surrounded by old friends,

01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:32.340
because I walk down the street in any city now, virtually,

01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:35.340
and people say, hello, Dr. Peterson, so nice to see you.

01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.980
Or they say better things than that.

01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:38.780
Very rarely bad things.

01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:42.780
One experience in 5,000 may be very rare,

01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:44.900
although you don't forget those either.

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.540
But it's very strange.

01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:51.500
And there's an intimacy, they know you well.

01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:54.620
And because they leap into,

01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.580
they avoid the small talk often.

01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:58.780
They leap into familiarity.

01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:00.940
It really is like it's an old friend

01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:01.900
and it feels like that.

01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:06.500
For me personally, the experience is the goodbye hurts,

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:09.900
because, you know, there's a sense

01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:11.580
where you're never gonna see that friend again.

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:12.740
Right.

01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:14.420
Yeah, that's a strange thing, eh?

01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:19.420
So to me, a lot of it just feels like goodbyes.

01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:23.380
And it is, you're right about that.

01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:26.700
And I mean, that's, I suppose, in some sense,

01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.500
part of the pain of opening yourself up to people,

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:33.060
because they also, Tammy has been struck particularly.

01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:35.420
She said, I really never knew what men were like.

01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:36.900
I said, well, what do you mean?

01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:41.100
She said, I cannot believe how polite the men are

01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:42.660
when they come and talk to you,

01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:43.940
because it's always the same.

01:57:43.940 --> 01:57:45.620
The pattern's very similar.

01:57:45.620 --> 01:57:47.180
The person comes up, they're mostly men,

01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:49.180
not always, but mostly.

01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.700
And they're tentative and they're very polite,

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:53.580
very, very polite.

01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:55.620
And they say, I hope I'm not bothering you.

01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:56.940
Do you mind, you know, do you mind?

01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:59.140
And I say, they're not bothering me.

01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:02.260
And I'm doing everything I can

01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:04.460
to not be the guy who's bothered by that.

01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:05.860
It's like, who do you think you are?

01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:07.540
Yeah, yes.

01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:12.180
You're the guy that, what, is famous and now is above that?

01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:13.300
Yeah.

01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.580
You don't wanna be that guy.

01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:15.420
No.

01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:17.820
So you wanna be grateful all the time

01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:20.540
when people open up like that.

01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:24.340
And so you gotta be alert and on point to do that properly,

01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:27.060
like right away, because for these, for you,

01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:29.460
it's five seconds or 10 seconds or 20 seconds,

01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:33.980
whatever it is, but for them, they've opened up.

01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:37.540
And so you can really nail them if you're foolish.

01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:40.660
After the 150 people, how do you come down from that?

01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:44.660
How do you find yourself again?

01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:48.140
Well, that was often when I got caught in Twitter traps,

01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:50.460
you know, cause I'm so burnt out by then

01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:55.020
from the talk and the audience interactions

01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:57.180
and the whole day, cause it's a new city,

01:58:57.180 --> 01:59:00.820
it's a new hotel, it's a new 5,000 people,

01:59:00.820 --> 01:59:04.180
it's a new book chapter, it's a whole new horizon of ideas

01:59:04.180 --> 01:59:06.740
and it's off to another city the next day.

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:10.740
I'm so burnt out by then that I'm not as good

01:59:10.740 --> 01:59:13.500
at controlling my impulses as I might be.

01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.340
And Twitter was a real catastrophe for that

01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.500
cause it would hook me and then I couldn't,

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:20.820
like I used to, when I was working on my book a lot,

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.620
I used to call Tammy and say, look,

01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:25.420
you have to come and get me, I can't stop.

01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:28.380
I can't stop, I got tired and then I kind of,

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:31.700
cause it's part of a kind of hypomanic focus.

01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:34.700
I couldn't quit, it's like, oh no, I'm still writing,

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:37.300
I need to get away from this, but I couldn't stop.

01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:42.300
And so it's better to read something

01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:45.020
a book.

01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:46.140
Fiction, non-fiction.

01:59:46.140 --> 01:59:48.500
Fiction, Stephen King.

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.300
I was reading a lot of Stephen King

01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:52.420
when I was on tour last time, that was good.

01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:53.260
I liked Stephen King a lot.

01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:54.580
It's a great narratives.

01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:57.780
Great and great characterization, you know?

01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:00.580
So, and there's a familiarity

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:02.900
about Stephen King's writing too,

02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:05.340
that he writes about people you know.

02:00:05.340 --> 02:00:08.100
And so I really found that a relief.

02:00:08.100 --> 02:00:10.300
And so that was useful.

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:12.900
And that in order to tolerate this, let's say,

02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:14.300
or to be able to sustain it.

02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:16.740
Well, let's take a lot of negotiation

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:19.700
on the part of Tammy and I, because she's dragged

02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:24.220
into this and you know, her life is part of this,

02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:25.100
whatever this is.

02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:29.060
And she's had to find her way and has, for example,

02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:32.380
now she has a different hotel room than me when we travel.

02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:35.380
And she found that she didn't want to be on the tour

02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:37.940
this spring and I was ill again for part of it

02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:39.060
and that made it complicated.

02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:42.180
But she went away back home and she came back

02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:43.420
and she said, and she was nervous about it.

02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:45.420
She said, I think I need my own room.

02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:47.140
And part of me was not happy with that.

02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:48.500
It's like, what do you mean you need your,

02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:50.340
like, are we not married anymore?

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:52.380
It's like, you need your own room?

02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:54.860
And she said, well, you know, I can't,

02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:57.260
she has to do exercises because she was really sick

02:00:57.260 --> 02:00:59.860
and she has to keep herself in shape.

02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:02.180
And she has to have some time to do that.

02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:03.780
She does a lot of prayer and meditation

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:05.900
and she needs the time and she has her own podcast,

02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:08.820
which is going quite well and she needs the time.

02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:11.500
And I trust her and she said, well, I need this

02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:12.420
in order to continue.

02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:15.980
And I thought, well, okay, if you need this

02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:19.020
in order to continue, yes.

02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.380
Because she went away and didn't say,

02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.540
well, I don't want to be on the tour.

02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.500
I don't want to do this anymore.

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:25.940
She went away and prayed, let's say,

02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:28.700
how can I continue to do this?

02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:30.420
And that was the answer.

02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:32.700
And so she has her own hotel room.

02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:36.100
And that was a really good decision on her part.

02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:39.660
And she's very good and getting better all the time

02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:43.780
at figuring out what has to happen for her

02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:45.140
to make this sustainable.

02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:48.340
And all that's been is a plus

02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:50.980
because I don't want to travel without her

02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:53.580
and I don't want her life to be miserable.

02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:55.500
And I want her to be fully on board.

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:58.220
And so she has to be properly selfish

02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:00.740
like everyone does in a relationship.

02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:02.940
Yeah, and you have to, not just that,

02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:05.300
this is a weird thing that you're doing.

02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:08.220
And you have to, both you and her have to figure out

02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:11.740
how to like, how to manage this very intense

02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:13.700
intellectual social journey.

02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:15.220
Well, there's another element to it too

02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:16.380
that I didn't tell you about.

02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:19.500
So that was a typical day, but it's missing a big component

02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:22.140
because usually we also have a dinner

02:02:22.140 --> 02:02:26.820
with like 30 cultural representatives, I suppose,

02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:28.700
10 to 30 from each country.

02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:32.100
Cause I have a network of people who have networks

02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:35.780
who are setting me up with key decision makers

02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:37.140
in each country.

02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:39.540
And so then we have like an hour and a half of that.

02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:42.420
Now, sometimes that's on a day when I don't have a talk,

02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:44.860
but sometimes the talks are back to back.

02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:49.700
And so she also has to manage that and to be gracious.

02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:51.700
And then people are showing us exciting things

02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:53.940
and tours in the cities, which is all,

02:02:53.940 --> 02:02:56.380
like it's a surfeit of wonderful.

02:02:56.380 --> 02:02:57.340
Yes, exactly.

02:02:57.340 --> 02:03:00.220
But it's still, yeah, you have to be there for it.

02:03:00.220 --> 02:03:02.660
You have to be present for it mentally

02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:04.980
as a curious mind, as an intellectual mind.

02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:07.820
How do you, how do you get to sleep?

02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:11.820
Fortunately, that is almost never a problem.

02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:16.820
Even when I was unbelievably ill for about three years,

02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:18.700
I thought about that a lot too, you know,

02:03:18.700 --> 02:03:21.380
that I didn't do a really good job of explaining that

02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:24.740
while I was ill because it appeared in some sense

02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:26.900
that the reason I was ill was because I was taking

02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:30.860
benzodiazepines, but that isn't why I was ill.

02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:33.580
And then I took them and very low dose.

02:03:33.580 --> 02:03:36.140
And I took that for a long time and it helped

02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:37.300
whatever was wrong with me.

02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:39.380
And it looks like it was an allergy

02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:41.020
or maybe multiple allergies.

02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:45.020
And then that stopped working.

02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:47.860
And so I took a little bit more for about a month

02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:48.980
and that made it way worse.

02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:52.220
And so then I cut back a lot and then,

02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:54.780
then things really got out of hand.

02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:56.700
So there was a deeper thing.

02:03:56.700 --> 02:03:57.540
Oh yeah, definitely.

02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:00.220
What can you put words to?

02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:02.260
Well, I had a lot of immune, my daughter,

02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:06.060
as everyone knows, has a very reactive immune system.

02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:09.820
And Tammy has three immunological conditions,

02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:11.460
each of them quite serious.

02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.380
And I had psoriasis and peripheral uveitis,

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:17.740
which is an autoimmune condition and alopecia areata

02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:21.460
and chronic gum disease, all of which appeared

02:04:21.460 --> 02:04:22.980
to be allergy related.

02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:25.660
And so Michaela seems to have got all of that.

02:04:25.660 --> 02:04:28.420
And so that, and that I think was at the bottom of,

02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:30.540
cause I also had this proclivity to depression

02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:32.820
that was part of my family history.

02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:34.700
But I think that was all immunological

02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:35.540
as far as I can tell.

02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:37.780
So one of the things that's happened to me,

02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:40.460
I always noticed I really couldn't breathe.

02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:42.220
Like I could breathe about one fifth

02:04:42.220 --> 02:04:45.140
as much as I sometimes could.

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:48.420
And so I was always short of breath.

02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:53.060
And it looks like what that was perhaps was,

02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:56.380
I was always on the border of an anaphylactic reaction,

02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:57.620
which is not pleasant.

02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:01.180
And that's hypersympathetic activation,

02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:03.180
no parasympathetic activation.

02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:05.540
I couldn't relax at all.

02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:07.420
That's an immunological response.

02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:08.900
Allergic response, yeah.

02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:12.980
So anyways, that was what seemed, now this,

02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:14.460
I don't like to talk about this much

02:05:14.460 --> 02:05:16.260
cause it's so bloody radical and you know,

02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:17.260
I don't like to propagate it,

02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:19.620
but this diet seems to have stopped all of that.

02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:22.620
I don't have psoriasis, all of the patches have gone.

02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:25.460
My gum disease, which is incurable,

02:05:25.460 --> 02:05:27.220
I had multiple surgeries to deal with it,

02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:30.340
is completely gone, took three years.

02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:32.220
My right eye, which was quite cloudy,

02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:33.500
it's cleared up completely.

02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:36.900
What else has changed?

02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:41.220
Well, I lost 50 pounds and like instantly kept it off.

02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:45.900
I should mention that I too am not a deep investigator

02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:47.700
of nutritional science.

02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:49.620
I have my skepticism towards the degree

02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:51.580
to which it is currently is the science.

02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:55.460
Cause like a lot of complex systems is full of mystery

02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:57.980
and full of profiteers,

02:05:57.980 --> 02:06:00.100
the people that profit of different kinds of diets.

02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:02.300
But I should say for me personally,

02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:05.100
it does seem that I feel by far the best

02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:06.340
when I eat only meat.

02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:07.260
It's very interesting.

02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:10.020
And I discovered that a long time ago.

02:06:10.020 --> 02:06:10.860
First of all.

02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:12.220
How do you discover it?

02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:15.540
So by, the discovery went like this.

02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:17.940
I started listening to ultra marathon runners

02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:21.620
about 15 years ago and they started talking

02:06:21.620 --> 02:06:25.700
about fat adapted running.

02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:31.100
So I first discovered that I don't have to run super fast

02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:32.420
to enjoy running.

02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:35.420
Then in fact, I really enjoy running at a slower pace.

02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:38.380
So that was like step one is like, oh, okay.

02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:42.780
If I maintain something called the math rule,

02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:45.020
which is the pretty low heart rate.

02:06:45.020 --> 02:06:47.740
If I maintain that you can actually get pretty fast

02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:50.660
while maintaining a pretty slow average speed in general.

02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:55.700
Anyway, they fuel themselves on low carb diets.

02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:57.340
So I got into that.

02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:00.660
On top of that, I also, they also fast often.

02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:05.660
So I discovered how incredible my mind feels when fasted.

02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:08.220
You know, people call it intermittent fasting, but-

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:10.460
Well, that's an optimization of death

02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:15.340
because when you fast your body logically

02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:18.460
and obviously if you think about it biologically is,

02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:20.900
well, what does your body scavenge first?

02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:23.060
Well, damaged tissue.

02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:28.620
So the, and I know the literature on fasting to some degree

02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:30.660
and it's very compelling literature.

02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:35.100
If you starve dogs down, I think it's 20% below rats too,

02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:38.180
below their optimal body weight, they live 30% longer.

02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:39.060
Yeah.

02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:42.300
That's a lot, 30%, like it's like 30%.

02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:43.900
Yeah, 30%.

02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:46.420
Well, there is aspect to a lot of these things

02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:47.260
that make me nervous,

02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:49.740
because I always feel like there's no free lunch

02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:51.540
that I'm gonna pay for it somehow.

02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:55.980
But there is a focus that I am able to attain when I fast,

02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:57.900
especially when I eat once a day.

02:07:57.900 --> 02:08:01.380
My mind is almost like nervously focused.

02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:04.100
It's almost like an anxiety, but a positive one

02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:07.180
or one that I can channel into just like an excitement.

02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:10.460
You know, I wonder how much of that's associated with,

02:08:10.460 --> 02:08:13.940
well, imagine that that signifies lack of food,

02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:15.980
which not that hard to imagine.

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:17.860
Well, maybe you should be a lot more alert

02:08:17.860 --> 02:08:19.260
in that situation, right?

02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:22.740
Biologically speaking, because you're in hunting mode,

02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:26.540
let's say, you know, not desperate, but in hunting mode.

02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:28.420
And God only knows,

02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:31.140
maybe human beings should be in hunting mode all the time.

02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.820
Often, but we don't know that.

02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:37.500
So I wonder if it has a stress on the system

02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:39.940
that long-term causes the system to get...

02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:41.260
It doesn't look like it.

02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:43.580
It seems in case of fasting, not.

02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:44.980
And then on top of that,

02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:47.740
I discovered that the thing I enjoy,

02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:52.060
I just don't enjoy eating fat as much.

02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.100
So I love eating meat

02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:55.660
and when you talk about low carb diets.

02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:58.020
So I just discovered through that process,

02:08:58.020 --> 02:09:00.900
if somewhat fatty meat, but just meat,

02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:03.940
I just feel a lot of the things

02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:05.540
that make me feel weird about food,

02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:10.540
like a little groggy or like full or just whatever.

02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:14.100
The aspects of food that I don't enjoy,

02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:15.780
they're not there with meat.

02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:18.340
And I'm still able to enjoy company.

02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:22.700
And when I eat once a day and eat meat,

02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:24.460
at least in Texas,

02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:26.740
you could still have all the merriment of...

02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:27.580
Yeah, yeah.

02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:28.820
You have dinner with friends.

02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:30.940
Now, I don't do the, you know,

02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:35.940
you have a very serious thing that there's health benefits

02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:39.460
that you are very serious about.

02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:41.580
For me, I can still drink whiskey.

02:09:41.700 --> 02:09:45.420
I'll still do the things that add a little bit of...

02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:46.260
Spice.

02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:47.620
Spice into the thing.

02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:49.740
Now, when you completely remove the spice,

02:09:49.740 --> 02:09:52.340
it does become more difficult.

02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:53.780
Yeah, it's more difficult socially

02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:56.580
and Tammy seems to only be able to eat lamb,

02:09:56.580 --> 02:09:58.900
although she might be able to eat non-aged beef.

02:09:58.900 --> 02:10:02.260
And that makes traveling complicated too, right?

02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:04.660
Because, well, for obvious reasons,

02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:06.700
it's like, really, that's all you can eat?

02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:09.780
Yeah, well, c'est la vie.

02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:11.460
And maybe that's a form of craziness,

02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:15.540
If we can return to actually the thing you were talking about

02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:18.460
when you were thinking about a question before the lecture,

02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.660
let me ask you about thinking in general.

02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:25.180
This is something maybe that you and Jim Keller

02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:27.780
think a lot about is thinking how to think.

02:10:29.140 --> 02:10:32.900
How do you think through an idea?

02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:35.500
Well, first of all, I think, okay,

02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.060
that's a really good question.

02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.100
We tried to work that out with this essay app

02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:41.460
that my son and I have developed,

02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:42.700
because if you're gonna write,

02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:45.060
the first question is, well, what should I write about?

02:10:45.060 --> 02:10:46.060
What's the name of the app?

02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:47.300
Essay.app.

02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:53.140
And well, the first question is, well, what bugs you?

02:10:53.540 --> 02:10:54.820
What's bugging you?

02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:56.020
This is such a cool thing.

02:10:56.020 --> 02:10:57.780
It's like, where's my destiny?

02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:00.780
Well, what bothers you?

02:11:00.780 --> 02:11:02.180
Well, that's where your destiny is.

02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:04.860
Your destiny is to be found in what bothers you.

02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:07.340
Why did those things bother you?

02:11:07.340 --> 02:11:09.660
There's a lot of things you could be bothered by.

02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.460
Like a million things, man.

02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:14.500
But some things grip you, they bug you,

02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.740
and they might make you resentful and bitter,

02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:17.940
because they bug you so much,

02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:20.060
like they're your things, man.

02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:21.540
They've got you.

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:23.740
So then I look for a question

02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:26.020
that I would like the answer to,

02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:29.780
that I don't, and I would really like the answer to it,

02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:32.420
so I don't assume I already have the answer,

02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:35.380
because I would actually really like to have the answer.

02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:39.260
So if I could get a better answer, great.

02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:41.660
And so that's the first thing, and that's like a prayer.

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:45.300
It's like, okay, here's a mystery.

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:49.740
I would like to delve into it further.

02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.020
Well, so that's humility.

02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:54.100
It's like, here's a mystery, which means I don't know.

02:11:54.100 --> 02:11:55.900
I would like to delve into it further,

02:11:55.900 --> 02:11:58.940
which means I don't know enough already.

02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:01.860
And then comes the revelation.

02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:04.340
It's like, well, what's a revelation?

02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:08.620
Well, if you ask yourself a question, it's a real question.

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.340
Do you get an answer or not?

02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:11.700
An answer is, well, yeah,

02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:14.020
thoughts start to appear in your head.

02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:14.860
So-

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:15.700
From somewhere.

02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:16.540
That's right, from somewhere.

02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:17.740
Where do they come from?

02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:19.300
Do you have a sense?

02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:21.620
Depends on what you're aiming at.

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:23.220
Depends on the question.

02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:26.260
No, no, it does to some degree.

02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:29.060
It depends on your intent.

02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:32.500
So imagine that your intent is to make things better.

02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:35.340
Then maybe they come from the place

02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:37.260
that's designed to make things better.

02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:39.780
Maybe your intent is to make things worse.

02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:41.300
Then they come from hell.

02:12:42.260 --> 02:12:43.380
And you think, not really.

02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:45.860
It's like, you're so sure about that, are you?

02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:47.340
Is your intent conscious?

02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:48.780
Like, are you able to-

02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:51.700
It's conscious and habitual, right?

02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:54.020
Because as you practice something consciously,

02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:56.180
it becomes habitual, but it's conscious.

02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:59.540
It's like, when I sit down before I do a lecture,

02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:01.660
I think, okay, what's the goal here?

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:04.100
To do the best job I can.

02:13:04.100 --> 02:13:05.060
To what end?

02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:08.540
Well, people are coming here, not for political issues.

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:09.740
They're coming here because they're trying

02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:11.780
to make their lives better.

02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:13.020
Okay, so what are we doing?

02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:14.940
We're conducting a joint investigation

02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:17.500
into the nature of that which makes life better.

02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:18.740
Okay, what's my role?

02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:21.780
To do as good a job about that as possible.

02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:23.620
What state of mind do I have to be in?

02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:25.980
Am I annoyed about the theater?

02:13:25.980 --> 02:13:30.260
Or am I clued in and thrilled that 4,000 people

02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:33.620
have showed up at substantial expense and trouble

02:13:33.620 --> 02:13:35.420
to come and listen to me talk?

02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:36.940
And if I'm not in that state of mind,

02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:38.380
I think, well, maybe I need something to eat,

02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:39.900
or maybe I need to talk to someone

02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:44.460
because ingratitude is no place to start.

02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:48.180
It's like, I should be thrilled to be there, obviously.

02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:50.260
And so that orientation has to be there.

02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:51.460
And then I, is it conscious?

02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:52.740
All this is conscious.

02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:53.820
What am I serving?

02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:55.780
The highest good I can conceptualize.

02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:56.900
What is that?

02:13:56.900 --> 02:14:00.180
I have some sense, but I don't know it in the final analysis,

02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:02.580
which is why the investigation is being conducted.

02:14:02.620 --> 02:14:03.660
Who's doing it?

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:07.820
Me, whoever I'm communing with, and the audience.

02:14:07.820 --> 02:14:10.020
And so I try to get myself,

02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:11.500
and I chase everybody away for that.

02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:13.500
It's like, I have to do that by myself.

02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.860
Are you writing stuff down?

02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:19.300
Yes, at that point, I just make point notes.

02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:21.980
And it's usually about maybe 30 notes.

02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:24.220
But then on stage, I never refer to them.

02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:27.740
And I often don't even use the structure that I laid out.

02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:29.300
Kind of an interesting thing.

02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:31.460
From where do powerful phrases come from?

02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:35.820
Do you have a, do you try to encapsulate an idea

02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:38.420
into a sentence or two?

02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:42.620
Well, when I talk, I've practiced this since,

02:14:42.620 --> 02:14:45.740
consciously since 1985.

02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:51.620
I try to feel and see if the words are stepping stones

02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:53.860
or foundation stones, right?

02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:55.220
It's like, is this solid?

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:56.500
Is this word solid?

02:14:56.500 --> 02:14:57.860
Is this phrase solid?

02:14:57.860 --> 02:14:59.220
Is this sentence solid?

02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:04.140
It's a real sense of fundamental foundation

02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:05.060
under each word.

02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:08.220
And I suppose people ask me if I pray,

02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:11.100
and I would say, I pray before every word.

02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:16.460
Well, when you're asking questions,

02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:21.220
you're very clear-headed and present

02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:25.500
in your ability to ask questions and inquire.

02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:27.300
So how do you do that?

02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:32.340
So first of all, I'm worried that my mind

02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:39.180
easily gets trapped when I step on a word

02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:41.860
and I know it's unstable.

02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:45.380
You kind of realize that you don't really know

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:47.740
the definitions of any words you use.

02:15:47.740 --> 02:15:51.500
And that can be debilitating.

02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:56.620
So I kind of try to be more carefree about the words I use.

02:15:57.580 --> 02:15:59.180
Because otherwise you get trapped.

02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:00.820
You don't wanna be obsessional.

02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:04.900
Like literally, my mind halfway through the sentence

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:08.660
will think, well, what does the word sentence mean?

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:09.660
Right, right, right.

02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:10.500
Well, you know, neurologically.

02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:12.620
And then everything else just explodes.

02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:14.700
Your big picture idea explodes

02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:17.420
and you lost yourself in the minutia.

02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:21.900
Well, neurologically, there's a production center

02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:23.860
and an editing center.

02:16:23.860 --> 02:16:27.220
And those can be separately affected by strokes.

02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:30.380
And so often when people are writing or talking,

02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:33.100
they try to activate both at the same time.

02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:35.700
And that's so people will try to write an essay

02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:37.500
and get every sentence right in the first draft.

02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:38.980
That's a big mistake.

02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:40.900
And so then you might say, well, how can you be careful

02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:42.780
with your words, but carefree?

02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:46.180
And the answer is orient yourself properly, right?

02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:48.260
While in the conversation we're having,

02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:50.020
you have an orientation structure.

02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:52.020
You want to be prepared.

02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:53.860
You wanna be attentive.

02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:56.300
Then you wanna have an interesting conversation.

02:16:56.380 --> 02:16:58.380
And you wanna have the kind of interesting conversation

02:16:58.380 --> 02:17:01.540
that other people wanna listen to

02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:04.500
that will be good for them in some manner.

02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:06.340
Okay, so that's pretty good frame.

02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:09.220
And then you kind of scour your heart

02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:10.820
and you think, is that really what you want?

02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:11.820
Are you after fame?

02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:12.900
Are you after notoriety?

02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:14.260
Are you after money?

02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:17.820
I'm not saying any of those things are necessarily bad,

02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:20.100
but they're not optimal,

02:17:20.100 --> 02:17:22.860
especially if you're not willing to admit them, right?

02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:24.700
And so they can contaminate you.

02:17:24.700 --> 02:17:26.820
So you wanna be decontaminated.

02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:29.540
So you have the right trip, let's say.

02:17:29.540 --> 02:17:31.940
And so you have to put yourself,

02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:33.140
that's a meditative practice.

02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:36.660
You have to put yourself in the right receptive position

02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:38.180
with the right goal in mind.

02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:42.740
Then you can, and I think you can get better

02:17:42.740 --> 02:17:43.580
and better at this.

02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:47.340
Then you can trust what's going to happen.

02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:49.660
You know, so for example, before I came here,

02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:52.780
I mean, I presume you have a reason

02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:55.780
for doing the podcast with me.

02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:56.820
What's the reason?

02:17:59.980 --> 02:18:03.060
I mean, we wanted to talk for a long time,

02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:04.540
so the reason has evolved.

02:18:07.340 --> 02:18:12.220
One of the reasons is I've listened to you

02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:15.540
for quite a long time, so you've become a one-way friend.

02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:17.660
And I have many one-way friends.

02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:20.220
Some of my best friends don't even know I exist.

02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:24.020
I'm a big fan of podcasts and audiobooks.

02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:26.060
Actually, most of my friends are dead.

02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:26.900
Yeah, right.

02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:28.860
The writers.

02:18:28.860 --> 02:18:30.180
The definition of a reader.

02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:34.380
A lot of dead, great dead friends.

02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:37.460
So I wanted to meet this one-way friend, I suppose,

02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:39.460
and have a conversation.

02:18:39.460 --> 02:18:42.420
And then there's this kind of puzzle

02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:44.020
that I've been longing to solve.

02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:46.460
The same reason I went to Ukraine

02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:50.540
of asking this question of myself, who am I,

02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:53.020
and what was this part of the world?

02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:56.300
What is this thing that happened in the 20th century

02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:59.460
that I lost so much of my family there

02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:03.580
and I feel so much of my family is defined by that place?

02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:06.900
Now, that place includes the Soviet Union,

02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:09.660
it includes Russia and Ukraine,

02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:11.140
it includes Nazi Germany,

02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:14.620
it includes these big, powerful leaders

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:19.620
and huge millions of people that were lost in the beauty,

02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:22.100
the power of the dream,

02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:27.100
but were also the torture that was forced onto them

02:19:29.260 --> 02:19:33.540
through different governmental institutions.

02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:37.340
And you are somebody that seemed from some angle

02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:42.060
to also be drawn to try to understand what was that.

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:44.700
And not in some sort of historical sense,

02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:47.340
but in a deeply psychological human sense.

02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:48.180
What is that?

02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:49.700
Will it repeat again?

02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:51.740
In what way is it repeating again?

02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:53.100
And how can we stop it?

02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:54.140
And how can we stop it?

02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:54.980
And so-

02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:55.800
That's the crucial issue.

02:19:55.800 --> 02:20:00.100
I felt I wanted to, from a very different backgrounds,

02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:04.220
pull at the thread of that curiosity.

02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:08.580
You know, I'm an engineer, you're a psychologist,

02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:12.620
both lost in that curiosity and both wear suits

02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:17.060
and talk with various levels of eloquence

02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:23.620
about sort of the shadows that these,

02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:28.620
that history casts on us.

02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:30.380
And so that was one.

02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:31.620
And also the psychology,

02:20:31.620 --> 02:20:33.820
I wanted to be a psychiatrist for a long time.

02:20:33.820 --> 02:20:37.740
I was fascinated by the human mind.

02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:41.100
Until I discovered artificial intelligence,

02:20:41.100 --> 02:20:44.220
the fact that I could program and make a robot move.

02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:47.700
And until I discovered that magic,

02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:50.060
I thought I wanted to understand the human mind

02:20:50.060 --> 02:20:51.060
by being psychiatrists,

02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:55.060
by talking to people through talk therapy, psychotherapy.

02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:56.740
So now you've got the best of both worlds

02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:59.780
because you get to talk to people and you get to build robots.

02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:03.600
Yeah, I mean, but the dream ultimately is the robot.

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:05.920
I felt like by building the thing,

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:08.360
can you start to try to understand it.

02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:09.480
I think that's one way.

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:12.600
I mean, we all have different skills and proclivities.

02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:17.600
So like my particular one has to do with,

02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:22.160
I learned by building.

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:25.600
I think through a thing by building it.

02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:27.680
And programming is a wonderful thing

02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:30.680
because it allows you to like build a little toy example.

02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:33.320
So in the same way, you can do a little thought experiment.

02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:34.960
Programming allows you to create

02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:36.320
a thought experiment in action.

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:40.240
It can move, it can live and then you can ask questions of it.

02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:45.000
So all of those, because of my interest in Freud and Jung,

02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:51.880
you're also in different ways have delved deeply

02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:56.720
into humanity, the human psyche,

02:21:56.720 --> 02:22:00.320
through the perspective of those psychologists.

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:01.820
So for all those reasons,

02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:04.380
I thought our passage should cross.

02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:07.500
Yeah, well, so that's quite a frame for a discussion, right?

02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:08.740
You had all sorts of reasons.

02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:10.580
And then you think, well,

02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:13.180
are you just letting the conversation go where it will?

02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:15.420
It's like, well, not exactly.

02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:17.820
You spent all this time.

02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:19.820
It's not like this came about by accident,

02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:23.020
this conversation, you spent all this time framing it.

02:22:23.020 --> 02:22:26.780
And so all of that provides the implicit substructure

02:22:26.780 --> 02:22:28.540
for the play in the conversation.

02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:31.460
And if you have that implicit, here's another way.

02:22:31.460 --> 02:22:34.260
This is very much worth knowing is

02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:36.900
if you get the implicit structure of perception, right?

02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:39.100
Everything becomes a game.

02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:42.260
And not only that, a game you wanna play.

02:22:42.260 --> 02:22:44.060
And maybe in the final analysis,

02:22:44.060 --> 02:22:45.820
a game you'd wanna play forever.

02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:52.040
So, you know, that's obviously a distant beckoning ideal,

02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:57.180
but we know the games need rules or there's no play.

02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:03.180
Is there a device you can give now that we know the frame

02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:08.180
to give to me, Lex, about how to do this podcast better,

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:14.580
how to think about this world, how to be a good engineer,

02:23:20.980 --> 02:23:25.540
how to be a good human being from what you know about me?

02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:28.260
Take your preoccupation with suffering seriously.

02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:33.780
It's a serious business, right?

02:23:33.780 --> 02:23:36.660
And that's part of that to circle back to the beginning,

02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:40.140
let's say, that's that willingness to gaze into the abyss,

02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:41.580
which is obviously what you were doing

02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:43.460
when you went to Ukraine.

02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:48.460
It's like, it's gazing into the abyss that makes you better.

02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:52.160
The thing is, and this is maybe where Nietzsche's ideas

02:23:52.160 --> 02:23:55.120
not as differentiated as it became.

02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:00.880
Sometimes your gaze can be forcefully directed

02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:04.920
towards the abyss, and then you're traumatized.

02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:08.120
If it's involuntary and accidental, it can kill you.

02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:14.120
The more it's voluntary, the more transformative it is.

02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:18.200
And that's part of that idea about facing death and hell.

02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:21.280
It's like, can you tolerate death and hell?

02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:26.280
And the answer is, this terrible answer is yes,

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:31.520
to the degree that you're willing to do it, voluntarily.

02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:34.160
And then you might ask, well, why should I have

02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:37.320
to subject myself to death and hell?

02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:38.920
I'm innocent.

02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:40.780
And then the answer to that is,

02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.880
even the innocent must be voluntarily sacrificed

02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:48.880
to the highest good.

02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:56.360
That's such an interesting distinction.

02:24:58.720 --> 02:24:59.800
Voluntary suffering.

02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:01.360
Voluntary, yeah.

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:04.000
Yeah, well, that's why the central Christian doctrine

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.960
is pick up your cross and follow me.

02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:11.760
And I'm speaking, not in religious terms, saying that.

02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:13.580
I'm just speaking as a psychologist.

02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:15.360
It's like one of the things we've learned

02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:18.800
in the last hundred years is voluntary exposure

02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:22.160
to that which freezes and terrifies you

02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:25.280
in measured proportions is curative.

02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:30.280
So a form of, at least in part,

02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:32.500
involuntary sufferings, depression.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.940
Do you have advice for people on how to find a way out?

02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:43.520
You're a man who has suffered in this way,

02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:46.200
perhaps continued to suffer in this way.

02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:47.740
How do you find a way out?

02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:50.920
The first thing I do as a clinician,

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:53.000
if someone comes to me and says they're depressed

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.760
is ask myself a question.

02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:57.840
Well, what does this person mean by that?

02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:59.640
So I have to find out, like,

02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:01.000
because maybe they're not depressed,

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.160
maybe they're hyperanxious or maybe they're obsessional.

02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:07.720
Like there's various forms of powerful negative emotion.

02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:09.640
So they need to be differentiated.

02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:11.480
But then the next question you have to ask is,

02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:16.000
well, are you depressed or do you have a terrible life?

02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:19.280
Or do you have a terrible life?

02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:21.800
Or is it some combination of the two?

02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:26.160
So if you're depressed, as far as I can tell,

02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:27.760
you don't have a terrible life.

02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:30.860
You have friends, you have family,

02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:32.160
you have an intimate relationship,

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:33.640
you have a job or a career,

02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:35.360
you're about as educated as you should be

02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:36.820
given your intelligence,

02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:39.220
you use your time outside of work wisely,

02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:42.620
you're not beholden to alcohol or other temptations,

02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:47.580
you're engaged in the community in some fundamental sense

02:26:47.580 --> 02:26:49.460
and all that's working.

02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:52.580
Now, if you have all that and you're feeling really awful,

02:26:52.580 --> 02:26:54.900
you're either ill or you're depressed.

02:26:54.900 --> 02:26:57.740
And so then sometimes there's a biochemical route

02:26:57.740 --> 02:26:59.220
to that treatment of that.

02:26:59.220 --> 02:27:02.860
My experience has been as a clinician is if you're depressed,

02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:05.660
but you have a life and you take an antidepressant,

02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:07.260
it will probably help you a lot.

02:27:08.100 --> 02:27:10.700
Now, maybe you're not depressed.

02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:13.540
Exactly, you just have a terrible life.

02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:14.820
What does that look like?

02:27:16.780 --> 02:27:20.060
You have no relationship, your family's a mess,

02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:23.620
you've got no friends, you've got no plan, you've got no job.

02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:26.100
You use your time outside of work,

02:27:26.100 --> 02:27:28.220
not only badly, but destructively.

02:27:28.220 --> 02:27:30.540
You have a drug or alcohol habit

02:27:30.540 --> 02:27:33.540
or some other vice, pornography addiction.

02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:37.340
You are completely unengaged in the surrounding community.

02:27:37.340 --> 02:27:41.300
You have no scaffolding whatsoever to support you

02:27:41.300 --> 02:27:44.460
in your current mode of being or you move forward.

02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:48.700
And then as a therapist, well, you do two things.

02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:51.780
Well, if it's depression per se, well, like I said,

02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:55.180
there's sometimes a biochemical route, a nutritional route.

02:27:55.180 --> 02:27:56.740
There's ways that can be addressed.

02:27:56.740 --> 02:27:59.660
It's probably physiological if you're at least in part,

02:27:59.660 --> 02:28:01.900
if you're depressed, but you have an okay life.

02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:03.900
Sometimes it's conceptual.

02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:06.580
You can turn to dreams sometimes to help people

02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:09.780
because dreams contain the seeds of the potential future.

02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:12.140
And if your person is a real good dreamer

02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:14.540
and you can analyze dreams, that can be really helpful.

02:28:14.540 --> 02:28:17.420
But that seems to be only true for more creative people.

02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:19.460
And for the people who just have a terrible life,

02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:22.780
it's like, okay, you have a terrible life.

02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:26.820
Well, let's pick a front.

02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:31.820
How about you need a friend, like one sort of friend?

02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:36.340
Do you know how to shake hands and introduce yourself?

02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:38.820
I'll have the person show me.

02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:40.460
So let's do it for a sec.

02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:45.100
So it's like this, hi, I'm Jordan, right?

02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:46.820
And people don't know how to do that.

02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:49.140
And then they can't even get the ball rolling.

02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:51.380
For the listener, Jordan just gave me a firm handshake.

02:28:51.380 --> 02:28:54.420
Yeah, as opposed to a dead fish, you know?

02:28:54.420 --> 02:28:56.980
And there's these elementary social skills

02:28:56.980 --> 02:28:59.820
that hypothetically, if you were well cared for,

02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:02.100
you learned when you were like three.

02:29:02.100 --> 02:29:05.020
And sometimes people have, I had lots of clients.

02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:09.900
To whom no one ever paid any attention.

02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:12.700
And they needed like 10,000 hours of attention.

02:29:12.700 --> 02:29:13.980
And some of that was just listening

02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:17.580
because they had 10,000 hours of conversations

02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:19.220
they never had with anyone.

02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:21.580
And they were all tangled up in their head.

02:29:21.580 --> 02:29:24.900
And they had to just, one client in particular,

02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:28.460
I worked with this person for 15 years.

02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:33.460
And what she wanted from me was for me

02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:36.380
just to shut the hell up for 50 minutes,

02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:37.980
which was very hard for me.

02:29:37.980 --> 02:29:41.980
And to just tell me what had happened to her.

02:29:41.980 --> 02:29:44.940
And then what happened at the end of the conversation,

02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:48.100
then I could discuss a bit with her.

02:29:48.100 --> 02:29:50.260
And then as we progressed through the years,

02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:52.580
the amount of time that we spent in discussion

02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:55.180
increased in proportion in the sessions

02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:58.780
until by the time we stopped seeing each other,

02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:00.780
when my clinical practice collapsed,

02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:06.340
we were talking about 80% of the time.

02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:09.940
But she literally, she'd never been attended to properly ever.

02:30:09.940 --> 02:30:13.580
And so she was an uncarved block in the Taoist sense, right?

02:30:13.580 --> 02:30:16.340
She hadn't been subjected to those flaming swords

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:19.340
that separated the wheat from the chaff.

02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:22.660
And so you can do that in therapy.

02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:25.420
If you're listening and you're depressed,

02:30:25.420 --> 02:30:28.340
I would say if you can't find a therapist

02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:29.820
and that's getting harder and harder

02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:32.260
because it's actually become illegal to be a therapist now

02:30:32.260 --> 02:30:34.540
because you have to agree with your clients,

02:30:34.540 --> 02:30:37.420
which is a terrible thing to do with them.

02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:40.700
Just like it's terrible just to arbitrarily oppose them.

02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:44.060
You could do the self-authoring program online

02:30:44.060 --> 02:30:46.580
because it helps you write an autobiography.

02:30:46.580 --> 02:30:49.460
And so if you have memories that are more than 18 months old

02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:51.580
that bother you when you think them up,

02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:54.340
part of you is locked inside that.

02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:59.340
An undeveloped part of you is still trapped in that.

02:30:59.740 --> 02:31:01.620
That's a metaphorical way of thinking about it.

02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:04.100
That's why it still has emotional significance.

02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:06.740
So you can write about your past experiences,

02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:08.740
but I would say wait for at least 18 months

02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:10.460
if something bad has happened to you.

02:31:10.460 --> 02:31:12.060
Because otherwise you just hurt yourself again

02:31:12.060 --> 02:31:13.140
by encountering it.

02:31:14.140 --> 02:31:16.700
You can bring yourself up to date with an autobiography.

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:18.900
There's an analysis of faults and virtues.

02:31:18.900 --> 02:31:20.020
That's the present authoring.

02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:23.660
And then there's a guided writing exercise

02:31:23.660 --> 02:31:25.940
that helps you make a future plan.

02:31:25.940 --> 02:31:30.420
That's, young men who do that could go to college.

02:31:30.420 --> 02:31:32.460
Young men who do that, 90 minutes.

02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:34.420
Just the future authoring, 90 minutes.

02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:37.220
They're 50% less likely to drop out.

02:31:37.220 --> 02:31:38.860
That's all it takes.

02:31:38.860 --> 02:31:43.540
So sometimes depression is this heavy cloud

02:31:43.540 --> 02:31:46.300
that makes it hard to even make a single step towards it.

02:31:46.300 --> 02:31:48.820
Or you said isolate, make a friend.

02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:49.940
Oh man, sometimes-

02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:52.020
The first step is extremely difficult.

02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:54.900
Oh my God, sometimes it's way worse than that.

02:31:54.940 --> 02:31:57.060
Like I had clients who were so depressed

02:31:57.060 --> 02:31:59.020
they literally couldn't get out of bed.

02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:01.180
So what's their first step?

02:32:01.180 --> 02:32:05.900
It's like, can you sit up once today?

02:32:05.900 --> 02:32:06.740
No.

02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:10.620
Can you prop yourself up on your elbows once today?

02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:13.220
Like you just, you scale back the dragon

02:32:14.100 --> 02:32:16.980
till you find one that's conquerable

02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:18.140
that moves you forward.

02:32:18.140 --> 02:32:19.900
There's a rubric for life.

02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:23.180
Scale back the dragons till you find one conquerable.

02:32:23.180 --> 02:32:25.860
And it'll give you a little bit of gold.

02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:27.260
Commensurate with the struggle.

02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:29.100
But the plus side of that,

02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:31.020
cause that's, you think that, God, that's depressing.

02:32:31.020 --> 02:32:35.420
You mean I have to start by sitting up

02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:37.700
while you do, if you can't sit up.

02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:39.340
But the plus side of that is

02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:40.940
it's the Pareto distribution issue,

02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:45.860
is that aggregates exponentially increase.

02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:47.940
And failures do too, by the way,

02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:50.100
but aggregates exponentially increase.

02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:51.540
So once you start the ball rolling

02:32:51.540 --> 02:32:53.340
it can get zipping along pretty good.

02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:54.980
This person that I talked about

02:32:56.620 --> 02:33:00.420
was incapable of sitting with me in a cafe

02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:02.060
when we first met just talking,

02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:04.140
even though I was her therapist,

02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:07.380
but by the end she was doing standup comedy.

02:33:08.260 --> 02:33:10.860
So, you know, it took years,

02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:13.980
but still most people want to stand up comedy.

02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:15.900
That's quite the bloody achievement.

02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:19.180
She would read her poetry on stage too.

02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:23.860
So for someone who was petrified into paralysis

02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:28.860
by social anxiety and who had to start very small,

02:33:29.060 --> 02:33:31.620
it was a hell of an accomplishment.

02:33:31.620 --> 02:33:33.940
Yeah, it all starts with one step.

02:33:33.940 --> 02:33:38.260
Do you have advice for young people in high school?

02:33:38.260 --> 02:33:40.580
You've given a lot of people look up to you

02:33:40.580 --> 02:33:42.540
for advice, for strength,

02:33:42.540 --> 02:33:47.540
for strength to search for themselves, to find themselves.

02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:49.660
Take on some responsibility.

02:33:50.980 --> 02:33:53.220
Do something for other people.

02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:55.660
You're doing something for yourself while you're doing that,

02:33:55.660 --> 02:33:57.780
even if you don't know it for sure,

02:33:57.780 --> 02:34:00.180
because you're a community across time.

02:34:00.180 --> 02:34:02.540
Find something to serve.

02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:03.700
Somebody to help.

02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:06.980
Someone to help, a job to find a job.

02:34:06.980 --> 02:34:08.900
Do your best with the customers.

02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:10.220
Don't be above your job.

02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:12.740
You're going to get an entry-level job when you're a kid.

02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:14.660
Well, what else would you want?

02:34:14.660 --> 02:34:15.500
You want to be the boss?

02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:16.340
What do you know?

02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:17.780
You don't know anything.

02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:20.260
You could be the boss of your job.

02:34:20.260 --> 02:34:22.140
You know, if you're working in a grocery store

02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:23.380
or you're working in a convenience store,

02:34:23.380 --> 02:34:26.620
assuming you're not working for terrified tyrants,

02:34:26.620 --> 02:34:28.700
you can be nice to the customers.

02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:30.940
You can develop your social skills.

02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:34.140
You can learn how to handle a boss-employee relationship.

02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:37.780
You can be there 15 minutes early and leave 15 minutes late.

02:34:37.780 --> 02:34:40.380
Like you can learn in an entry-level job, man.

02:34:40.380 --> 02:34:42.900
And I'll tell you, if you take an entry-level job

02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:45.860
and you learn and it's a reasonably decent place,

02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:48.460
you will not be in an entry-level job for long

02:34:48.460 --> 02:34:50.100
because everyone who's competent

02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:52.140
is desperate for competent people.

02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.180
And if you go and show yourself as competent,

02:34:54.180 --> 02:34:55.180
there'll be a trial period,

02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:57.180
but if you go show yourself as competent,

02:34:57.180 --> 02:34:59.300
all sorts of doors you didn't even know were there

02:34:59.300 --> 02:35:01.100
will start opening like mad.

02:35:01.100 --> 02:35:04.460
So you strive for competence, for craftsmanship.

02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:07.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for discipline.

02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:11.020
You know, I mean, I said in one of the chapters

02:35:11.020 --> 02:35:14.180
in my books is focused on putting your house in order.

02:35:14.180 --> 02:35:15.780
It's like, well, how do you start?

02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:16.740
Make your bed.

02:35:18.020 --> 02:35:21.540
You know, it actually took me quite a long time in my life

02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:23.580
before I made my bed regularly in the morning.

02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:25.380
Most of my life was in pretty good order,

02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:27.660
but that was one thing I didn't have in order.

02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:31.020
My clothes in my closet as well, all that's in order.

02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:31.860
Not all of it.

02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:33.300
I'm cleaning out some drawers right now,

02:35:33.300 --> 02:35:37.980
but look around and see what bugs you in your room.

02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:39.180
Just look.

02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:40.940
It's like, okay, I'm in my room.

02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:43.060
No, it bugs me.

02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:44.780
Okay, why?

02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:47.340
Well, the paint's peeling there and it's dusty there

02:35:47.340 --> 02:35:50.860
and the carpet's dirty and that corner's kind of ugly

02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:52.340
and the light there isn't very good

02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:54.380
and my clothes closet's a mess

02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:56.500
so I don't even like to open it.

02:35:56.500 --> 02:35:59.140
Okay, that's a lot of problems.

02:35:59.140 --> 02:36:00.340
That sucks.

02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:02.300
That's a lot of opportunity.

02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:04.300
Pick something and fix it.

02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:05.940
Something that bugs you.

02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:07.460
Yeah, but not too much.

02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:11.980
So the rule is pick something that you know would make,

02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:14.900
pick a problem, pick a solution to it

02:36:14.900 --> 02:36:19.020
that you know would help, that you could do,

02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:20.780
that you would do.

02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:22.260
So you have to negotiate with yourself.

02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:23.900
It's like, well, I won't clean up this room.

02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:24.740
How do you know?

02:36:24.740 --> 02:36:27.100
I've been in here for 10 years and I've never cleaned it up.

02:36:27.100 --> 02:36:29.740
It's like, well, obviously that's too big a dragon for you.

02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:32.380
Would you clean one drawer?

02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:33.220
Find out.

02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:35.780
And so imagine now you wanna be happy

02:36:35.780 --> 02:36:37.180
when you open that drawer and you think,

02:36:37.180 --> 02:36:38.020
well, that's stupid.

02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:38.860
It's like, is it?

02:36:40.180 --> 02:36:41.620
Maybe it's your sock drawer,

02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:44.420
which I cleaned up in my room the other day, by the way.

02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:46.300
You're gonna open that every morning.

02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:50.860
That's like 30 seconds of your life every day.

02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:54.980
Okay, so that's three minutes a week.

02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:57.380
That's 12 minutes a month.

02:36:57.380 --> 02:36:59.620
That's two hours a year.

02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:01.140
So maybe your life is made out of,

02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:02.780
you've got 16 hours a day.

02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:03.700
Let's figure this out.

02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:06.940
Five, 12 in an hour, 12 in an hour,

02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:09.180
144 in 12 hours.

02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:12.060
Yeah, let's say 200, 205 minute chunks.

02:37:12.060 --> 02:37:12.900
That's your life.

02:37:12.900 --> 02:37:15.300
Ladies and gentlemen, Jordan Peterson did just some math

02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:17.460
how many five minute chunks there are in a day.

02:37:17.460 --> 02:37:19.300
And I'm pretty sure it's pretty accurate.

02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:20.620
It's approximately right.

02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:24.580
So you got 205 minute chunks and they repeat.

02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:26.380
A lot of them repeat.

02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:28.260
So if you get every one of those right,

02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:29.100
they're trivial, right?

02:37:29.100 --> 02:37:30.740
Who cares what my sock drawer looks like?

02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:33.100
It's fair enough, man, but that's your life.

02:37:33.100 --> 02:37:36.820
The things you repeat every day, the mundane things,

02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:39.340
I could get all those mundane things right.

02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:40.620
That's the game rules.

02:37:40.620 --> 02:37:43.380
It's like now all the mundane is in place.

02:37:43.380 --> 02:37:45.900
Now you can play because all the mundane is in place.

02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:47.020
And this is actually true.

02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:51.020
So with children, imagine you want your children to play.

02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:53.660
Well, play is very fragile neurologically.

02:37:53.660 --> 02:37:57.340
Any competing motivation or emotion will suppress play.

02:37:57.340 --> 02:37:59.300
So everything has to be in order.

02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:02.060
Everything has to be a walled garden

02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:04.100
before the children will play.

02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:05.940
That's a good way of thinking about it.

02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:07.460
So you put everything in order and you think,

02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:09.540
oh my God, now I'm tyrannized by this order.

02:38:09.540 --> 02:38:12.540
It's like, no, you aren't, not if it's voluntary.

02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:15.700
And then the order is the precondition for the freedom.

02:38:15.700 --> 02:38:16.660
And so then all of a sudden

02:38:16.660 --> 02:38:17.940
you get all these things in order.

02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:19.340
It's like, oh, look at this.

02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:21.620
I've got some room to play here.

02:38:21.620 --> 02:38:24.820
And then maybe you're not depressed.

02:38:24.820 --> 02:38:26.900
No, it's often not that simple, you know?

02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:28.660
It's not that simple.

02:38:28.660 --> 02:38:31.060
Try putting your room in order, perfect order.

02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:31.900
That's hard, man.

02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:33.020
I mean, it's a really powerful way

02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:34.460
to think about those five minute chunks.

02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:36.780
Just get one of them right in a day.

02:38:36.780 --> 02:38:39.380
Yeah, well, if you do that for 200 days,

02:38:39.380 --> 02:38:40.700
your life is in order.

02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:43.980
You know, I thought I did that with my clients a lot.

02:38:43.980 --> 02:38:46.460
So a lot of them would come home from work, the guys,

02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:47.940
and their wives would meet them at the door

02:38:47.940 --> 02:38:49.940
and it'd be a fight right away.

02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:51.140
You know, and it's a clash there

02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:53.300
because he comes home and he's tired and hungry

02:38:53.300 --> 02:38:55.700
and he's worked all day and he's hoping that, you know,

02:38:55.700 --> 02:38:57.980
he gets welcomed when he comes back to the home,

02:38:57.980 --> 02:38:59.860
but then the wife is at home

02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:01.060
and she's been with the kids all day

02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:02.060
and she's tired and hungry

02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:03.420
and she's hoping that when he comes home,

02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:05.820
he'll show her some appreciation for what's happened today

02:39:05.820 --> 02:39:06.980
and then they clash

02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:08.780
and then they both have problems to discuss

02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:10.500
because they've had their troubles during the day.

02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:13.180
And so then every time they get together,

02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:16.300
they're not, like it's a bit of a fight for 20 minutes

02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:18.900
and then the whole evening is screwed.

02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:21.820
And so then you think, okay, here's the deal.

02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:24.980
It's knock and the door will open.

02:39:24.980 --> 02:39:28.900
Okay, you get to pick what happens when you come home,

02:39:28.900 --> 02:39:30.180
but you have to figure out what it is.

02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:31.940
So now this is the deal.

02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:33.900
You treat yourself properly.

02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:35.340
You imagine coming home

02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:38.620
and it goes the way you want and need it to go.

02:39:38.620 --> 02:39:41.420
Okay, what does that look like?

02:39:41.420 --> 02:39:44.140
You get to have it, but you have to know what it is.

02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:46.020
What does it look like?

02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:48.060
And you think, okay, I want to come home.

02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:50.020
I want to be happy about coming home.

02:39:50.020 --> 02:39:50.860
I come home.

02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:53.620
I open the door.

02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:56.060
I say, hello, honey, I'm home.

02:39:56.060 --> 02:39:58.780
My wife says, hi, it's so nice to hear your voice.

02:39:58.780 --> 02:39:59.860
She comes up.

02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:02.460
She says, hi, dear.

02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:03.300
She gives you a hug.

02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:05.100
She says, how was your day?

02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:07.420
And you say, well, we'll sit and talk about that.

02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:08.700
How was your day?

02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:10.540
Well, we'll sit and talk about that.

02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:11.900
Do you need something to eat?

02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:14.300
Probably.

02:40:14.300 --> 02:40:16.260
Let's go sit and talk about our day.

02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:18.140
It's like, that sounds pretty good.

02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:20.060
Okay, that sounds pretty good.

02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:20.900
Might not be perfect,

02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:23.220
but sounds a hell of a lot better than what we're doing now.

02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:26.260
So how about we go talk to,

02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:29.300
we'll go talk to your wife and say, okay,

02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:31.020
this is what's happening when I come home.

02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:32.740
I would like it to be better.

02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:34.380
What would you like to have happen

02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:37.260
if you could have what you wanted?

02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:39.540
And so she sits down and she thinks, okay,

02:40:39.540 --> 02:40:41.420
if he comes home, what do I want to have happen?

02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:44.220
And then now you got two visions and you say,

02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:45.180
well, what would you like?

02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:48.940
And you listen and she says, what would you like?

02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:50.580
And you tell her, and then you think,

02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:53.300
okay, now how can we bring these visions together?

02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:55.620
So not only do we both get what we want,

02:40:55.620 --> 02:40:57.060
but because we've brought them together,

02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:58.620
we even get more than we want.

02:40:58.620 --> 02:40:59.980
Well, who wouldn't agree to that

02:40:59.980 --> 02:41:01.900
unless they were aiming down?

02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:02.860
And that's so exciting.

02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:04.300
It's not a compromise.

02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:08.380
It's a union of ideals that even makes a better ideal.

02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:09.500
And then you get to come home.

02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:12.140
And then there's another rule that goes along with that,

02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:15.740
which is, please, dear, have the grace

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:19.700
to allow me to do this stupidly and badly

02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:22.300
while I learn at least 20 times

02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:25.980
and all give you the same leeway.

02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:28.940
And then we'll practice stupidly for 20 times

02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:30.540
and we'll talk about it.

02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:32.020
And then maybe we'll get it right

02:41:32.020 --> 02:41:35.500
for the next 10,000 times, right?

02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:37.900
And you can do that with your whole life

02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:39.140
and you can do that with your kids

02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:40.860
and you can do that with your family.

02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:42.500
Like, it's not easy, but you can do it.

02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:44.620
It's a lot easier than the alternative.

02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:47.580
Let me ask for some dating advice from Jordan Peterson.

02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:52.500
How do you find on that topic the love of your life?

02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:54.540
That's a good question.

02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:58.020
I was asked that multiple times on my tour,

02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:59.540
three times in a row, in fact,

02:41:59.540 --> 02:42:02.900
because we ask people to use this Slido gadget.

02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:05.060
That's a popular question.

02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:07.220
To vary, it always came up to the top.

02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:10.220
And I got asked that three times in a row

02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:11.700
and I didn't have a good answer.

02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:16.340
And then I thought, why don't I have a good answer?

02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:17.860
I thought, oh, I know why,

02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:19.660
because that's a stupid question.

02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:22.740
So why?

02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:23.580
Why?

02:42:23.580 --> 02:42:26.340
Because it's putting the cart before the horse.

02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:27.820
Here's the right question.

02:42:29.660 --> 02:42:31.860
How do I make myself into the perfect date?

02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:34.580
You answer that question

02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:36.180
and you will not have any problem

02:42:36.180 --> 02:42:37.460
answering the previous question.

02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:40.460
It's like, what do I want in a partner?

02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:44.700
If I offered everything I could to a partner,

02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:46.260
who would I be?

02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:47.460
You work on that.

02:42:47.460 --> 02:42:48.300
Ask that question.

02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:49.540
Just ask.

02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:51.260
Just ask yourself, okay?

02:42:51.260 --> 02:42:56.260
I have to be the person that women would want.

02:42:58.100 --> 02:42:59.340
Okay, what do they want?

02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:04.100
Clean, that's not a bad start.

02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:08.620
Reasonably good physical shape.

02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:15.100
So healthy, productive, generous, honest.

02:43:19.300 --> 02:43:21.580
Willing to delay gratification.

02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:22.780
So you dance with a woman.

02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:23.700
It's like, what's she doing?

02:43:23.700 --> 02:43:24.740
What are you two doing?

02:43:24.740 --> 02:43:26.500
Well, it's a patterned,

02:43:26.500 --> 02:43:28.020
there's patterns happening around you.

02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:29.420
That's the music, patterns.

02:43:29.420 --> 02:43:31.740
Patterns of being, that's the music.

02:43:31.740 --> 02:43:32.900
Now, can you align yourself

02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:35.100
with the patterns of being gracefully?

02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:37.340
That's what she's checking out.

02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:40.340
And then can you do that with her?

02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:43.420
And then can you do that in a playful

02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:45.380
and attentive manner

02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:47.220
and keep your bloody hands to yourself

02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:48.580
for at least a minute?

02:43:49.580 --> 02:43:52.860
And so can you dance in a playful manner?

02:43:52.860 --> 02:43:55.220
It's like, you can go through this in your imagination

02:43:55.220 --> 02:43:57.980
and you know, you'll know, you know.

02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:00.300
And then you think, well, how far am I from those things?

02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:01.740
And the answer is usually, man,

02:44:01.740 --> 02:44:06.580
it's pretty horrible abyss separating you from that ideal.

02:44:06.580 --> 02:44:11.580
But the harder you work on offering other people

02:44:11.980 --> 02:44:14.140
what they need and want,

02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:16.940
the more people will line up to play with you.

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:18.380
And so it's the wrong question.

02:44:18.380 --> 02:44:21.420
It's like, how can I be the best partner possible?

02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:22.820
And then you think, well, if I do that,

02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:25.380
people will just take advantage of me.

02:44:25.380 --> 02:44:29.220
And that's the non-naive objection, right?

02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:30.340
Because the naive person's saying,

02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:31.940
well, I'll be good and everyone will treat me right.

02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:34.980
It's like the cynic says, no, I'll be good

02:44:34.980 --> 02:44:37.780
and someone will take me out.

02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:41.020
And then you think, well, what do you do

02:44:41.020 --> 02:44:42.100
about that objection?

02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:45.780
And the answer is, well, you factor that in.

02:44:45.780 --> 02:44:48.820
And that's why you're supposed to be, what is it?

02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:51.340
As soft as a dove and as wise as a serpent.

02:44:51.340 --> 02:44:54.380
It's like, I know you're full of snakes.

02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:55.780
I know it.

02:44:55.780 --> 02:45:00.660
Maybe I know it more than you do, but we'll play anyways.

02:45:00.660 --> 02:45:01.500
And that's a good-

02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:02.340
Take the risk anyway.

02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:04.300
That's right, voluntarily, right?

02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:06.820
It's like, and what's so cool about that

02:45:06.820 --> 02:45:08.940
is that even though the person you're dealing with

02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:13.140
is full of snakes, if you offer your hand in trust

02:45:13.140 --> 02:45:17.020
and it's real, you will evoke the best in them.

02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:18.900
And that's true even, I've dealt with people

02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:23.900
who are pretty damn criminal and pretty psychopathic

02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:28.220
and sometimes dangerously so.

02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:30.780
And you tread very lightly when you're dealing

02:45:30.780 --> 02:45:33.980
with someone like that, especially if they're intoxicated.

02:45:33.980 --> 02:45:38.980
And even then, your best bet is that alert trust,

02:45:38.980 --> 02:45:41.980
it's the only, it's the fact that the only thing I know

02:45:41.980 --> 02:45:45.420
that the guy had one client who was a paranoid,

02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:49.340
he was paranoid psychopath, that's a bad combination.

02:45:49.340 --> 02:45:50.940
He was a bad guy, man.

02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:54.340
He had like four restraining orders on him

02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:56.700
and restraining orders don't work on the sort of people

02:45:56.700 --> 02:45:59.380
that you put restraining orders on.

02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:03.020
And he used to be harassed now and then by a bureaucrat

02:46:03.020 --> 02:46:05.980
in a bank with delusions of power.

02:46:06.180 --> 02:46:08.900
And he would say to them, he used to kind of act this out

02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:11.500
to me when I was talking to him, he'd say,

02:46:13.100 --> 02:46:15.300
I'm going to be your worst nightmare.

02:46:16.260 --> 02:46:19.580
And he meant it and he would do it.

02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:23.380
He had this obsessional psychopathic vengeance

02:46:23.380 --> 02:46:27.140
that was just like right there, paranoid to the hilt

02:46:27.140 --> 02:46:29.820
and paranoid people are hyper acute.

02:46:29.820 --> 02:46:32.540
So they're watching you for any reason,

02:46:32.540 --> 02:46:34.140
they're hyper acute.

02:46:34.140 --> 02:46:38.620
So they're watching you for any sign of deceit

02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:41.580
or manipulation and they're really good at it.

02:46:41.580 --> 02:46:44.460
Cause like they're 100%, that's what paranoia is.

02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:47.180
It's 100% focus on that.

02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:49.860
And even under those circumstances,

02:46:49.860 --> 02:46:54.460
if you step carefully enough, you can,

02:46:54.460 --> 02:46:57.220
maybe you can avoid the acts.

02:46:57.220 --> 02:46:59.100
That's a good thing to know if you ever meet someone

02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:00.220
truly dangerous.

02:47:01.220 --> 02:47:02.700
Absolutely.

02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:05.460
I believe in that, that being fragile,

02:47:05.460 --> 02:47:07.980
nevertheless taking that leap of trust

02:47:07.980 --> 02:47:10.180
towards another person, even when they're dangerous,

02:47:10.180 --> 02:47:12.060
especially when they're dangerous.

02:47:12.060 --> 02:47:15.940
If you care, if there's something there

02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:18.380
in those hills you want to find,

02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:21.260
then that's probably the only way you're going to find

02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:23.420
is taking that risk.

02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:26.420
I have to ask you about Gulag Archipelago

02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:30.380
by Solzhenitsyn that speak to this very point.

02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:31.780
There's so many layers to this book.

02:47:31.780 --> 02:47:34.020
We could talk about it forever.

02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:38.060
I'm sure in many ways we are talking about it forever,

02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:41.220
but there is sort of one of the themes captured

02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:43.300
in a few ways that was described to the book

02:47:43.300 --> 02:47:45.300
is that line between good and evil

02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:48.580
that runs through every human being.

02:47:48.580 --> 02:47:52.900
As he writes, the line dividing good and evil

02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:55.420
cuts through the heart of every human being.

02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:57.580
During the life of any heart,

02:47:57.580 --> 02:47:59.820
this line keeps changing place.

02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:03.580
Sometimes it is squeezed one way to exuberant evil

02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:06.140
and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space

02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:07.780
for good to flourish.

02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:09.900
One and the same human being is,

02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:12.780
at various ages, under various circumstances,

02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:15.060
a totally different human being.

02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:17.660
At times he's close to being a devil,

02:48:17.660 --> 02:48:22.140
at times to sainthood, but his name doesn't change.

02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:24.780
And to that name, we ascribe the whole lot,

02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:26.540
good and evil.

02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:27.780
What do you think about this line?

02:48:27.780 --> 02:48:29.380
What do you think about this thing

02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:31.860
where we talked about if you give somebody a chance,

02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:33.740
you actually bring out the best in them.

02:48:33.740 --> 02:48:36.460
What do you think about this other aspect

02:48:36.460 --> 02:48:41.460
that throughout time, that line shifts inside each person

02:48:41.660 --> 02:48:43.700
and you get to define that shift?

02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:45.980
What do you think about this line?

02:48:45.980 --> 02:48:47.620
Are we all capable of evil?

02:48:48.740 --> 02:48:50.460
Well, you know, the cosmic drama,

02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:53.620
that's Satan versus Christ.

02:48:53.660 --> 02:48:55.660
Like, well, who's that about?

02:48:55.660 --> 02:48:56.820
If it's not about you.

02:48:58.980 --> 02:49:01.460
I'm speaking just as a psychologist

02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:03.100
or as a literary critic.

02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:05.740
Those are characters, at least they're that.

02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:08.940
Well, are they human characters?

02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:10.620
Well, obviously.

02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:12.820
Well, are they archetypal human characters?

02:49:13.700 --> 02:49:14.660
Yes.

02:49:14.660 --> 02:49:18.420
What does that mean cosmically and ontologically?

02:49:18.420 --> 02:49:19.660
I don't know.

02:49:19.660 --> 02:49:21.020
Is the world a story?

02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:23.260
Maybe.

02:49:23.260 --> 02:49:24.660
The way stories are often told

02:49:24.660 --> 02:49:27.140
is the characters embody a stable.

02:49:27.140 --> 02:49:30.420
Those are not great literature though.

02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:32.180
It's very rare in great literature.

02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:33.940
What you have in great literature generally

02:49:33.940 --> 02:49:35.580
is the internal drama, right?

02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:40.580
And as the literature becomes more pop, I would say,

02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:42.940
the characters are more unitary.

02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:44.900
So there's a real bad guy and he's all bad

02:49:44.900 --> 02:49:47.900
and there's a real good guy and he's all good.

02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:49.660
And that's not as interesting.

02:49:49.660 --> 02:49:51.500
It's not as sophisticated.

02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:53.540
When you reach Dostoevsky in heights

02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:56.700
in literary representation or Shakespearean heights,

02:49:58.460 --> 02:50:00.780
you can identify with the villain.

02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:05.420
And that's when literature really reaches its pinnacle

02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:06.500
in some sense.

02:50:06.500 --> 02:50:08.660
And also the characters change throughout.

02:50:08.660 --> 02:50:09.500
They shift throughout.

02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:11.300
They're unpredictable throughout,

02:50:11.300 --> 02:50:14.540
taking the speaking of Russia more seriously recently.

02:50:14.540 --> 02:50:16.380
And I've gotten to talk to translators

02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:20.780
of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and Cherkov

02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:22.180
and those kinds of folks.

02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:25.980
And you get the, one of the mistakes that translators made

02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:28.380
with Dostoevsky for the longest time

02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:30.740
is they would, quote unquote,

02:50:30.740 --> 02:50:34.940
fix the chaotic mess that is Dostoevsky

02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:38.900
because there was a sense like he was too rushed

02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:39.980
in his writing.

02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:41.660
It seemed like there was tangents

02:50:41.660 --> 02:50:43.580
that had nothing to do with anything.

02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:46.580
The characters were unpredictable and not inconsistent.

02:50:46.580 --> 02:50:49.460
There's parts of phrases that seem to be incomplete,

02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:50.420
that kind of stuff.

02:50:51.060 --> 02:50:52.300
And what they realize that is,

02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:55.260
that's not, that's actually crafted that way.

02:50:55.260 --> 02:50:58.580
It's not, it's like editing James Joyce,

02:50:58.580 --> 02:51:00.020
like Finnegans Wake or something,

02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:01.740
because it doesn't make any sense.

02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:03.700
They realize that that is the magic of it,

02:51:03.700 --> 02:51:05.940
that captures the humanity of these characters,

02:51:05.940 --> 02:51:07.100
that they are unpredictable.

02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:08.780
They change throughout time.

02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:11.220
There's a bunch of contradictions.

02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:12.580
On which point I gotta ask,

02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:15.260
is there a case to be made that Brothers Karamazov

02:51:15.260 --> 02:51:16.980
is the greatest book ever written?

02:51:17.940 --> 02:51:20.180
Yeah, there is a case to be made for that.

02:51:20.980 --> 02:51:23.020
Is it better than Crime and Punishment?

02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:23.980
Yes, yeah.

02:51:23.980 --> 02:51:25.300
You think so?

02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:26.740
I'm not arguing with it.

02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:28.060
Why do you think that?

02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:30.420
Well, every book is a person,

02:51:30.420 --> 02:51:32.740
some of my best friends are inside that book.

02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:34.100
Yeah, it's an amazing book.

02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:35.660
There's no doubt about it.

02:51:35.660 --> 02:51:39.900
I think it's, some books are defined

02:51:39.900 --> 02:51:41.340
by your personal relationship with them,

02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:42.540
and that one was definitive,

02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:44.660
and I almost graduated to that one,

02:51:44.660 --> 02:51:46.580
because for the longest time,

02:51:46.620 --> 02:51:51.340
The Idiot was my favorite book of all,

02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:54.020
because I identified with the ideas

02:51:54.020 --> 02:51:55.700
represented by Prince Mishkin.

02:51:55.700 --> 02:51:56.740
I also identified-

02:51:56.740 --> 02:51:58.220
Ah, that's interesting.

02:51:58.220 --> 02:52:00.540
To Prince Mishkin as a human being.

02:52:00.540 --> 02:52:01.580
The holy fool.

02:52:01.580 --> 02:52:04.580
The fool, because the world kind of,

02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:07.340
my whole life still kind of sees me,

02:52:07.340 --> 02:52:08.700
saw me in my perception,

02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:12.900
my narrow perception as kind of the fool,

02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:17.700
and I, different from the interpretation

02:52:17.700 --> 02:52:19.900
that a lot of people take of this book,

02:52:19.900 --> 02:52:21.940
I see him as a kind of hero.

02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:22.860
Oh, definitely.

02:52:22.860 --> 02:52:26.860
To be a naive, quote unquote, fool,

02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:29.980
but really just a naive optimist,

02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:31.860
and naive in the best possible way.

02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:33.260
I do believe that-

02:52:33.260 --> 02:52:34.620
That's childlike.

02:52:34.620 --> 02:52:36.340
Yeah, childlike is a better,

02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:38.540
so naive is usually seen as-

02:52:38.540 --> 02:52:39.780
That's childish, naive.

02:52:39.780 --> 02:52:42.780
Yeah, but childlike.

02:52:42.780 --> 02:52:45.420
That's why no one enters the Kingdom of Heaven

02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:48.140
unless they become like a child.

02:52:48.140 --> 02:52:49.340
That's Prince Mishkin.

02:52:49.340 --> 02:52:51.020
Dostoevsky knew that.

02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:52.420
So that's why he liked The Idiot.

02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:53.780
That's so interesting.

02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:55.500
See, I think I like Crime and Punishment,

02:52:55.500 --> 02:52:57.300
because while you identified with Mishkin,

02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:59.860
I think I identified more with Raskolnikov,

02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:02.180
because I was tempted by Luciferian intellect,

02:53:02.180 --> 02:53:06.300
you know, in a manner very similar

02:53:06.300 --> 02:53:07.900
to the manner he was tempted.

02:53:07.900 --> 02:53:10.620
But I mean, I think you can make a case

02:53:10.620 --> 02:53:12.700
that the Brothers Karamazov is

02:53:12.700 --> 02:53:15.220
Dostoevsky's crowning achievement.

02:53:15.220 --> 02:53:16.060
Well-

02:53:16.060 --> 02:53:16.900
And that's something, man.

02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:18.580
He ruined literature for me,

02:53:20.380 --> 02:53:22.700
because everything else just felt insipid afterwards.

02:53:22.700 --> 02:53:25.500
Not everything, not everything.

02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:30.020
I found some books that, in my experience,

02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:32.020
hit that pinnacle.

02:53:32.020 --> 02:53:35.460
The Master and Margarita, that's a deadly book.

02:53:35.460 --> 02:53:36.940
I read that, I think, four times,

02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:40.100
and I still, it's unbelievably deep.

02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:43.460
There's a Nikos Kazantzakis, a Greek writer.

02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:45.740
Some of his books are,

02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:48.900
his writing is amazing as well.

02:53:48.900 --> 02:53:50.900
Did you ever connect with the literary,

02:53:50.900 --> 02:53:52.900
like existentialist, Camus,

02:53:53.900 --> 02:53:58.900
or people like Hermann Hesse, or even Kafka?

02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:00.380
Did you ever connect with those-

02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:01.420
To the same degree?

02:54:01.420 --> 02:54:02.260
Yeah, to the same-

02:54:02.260 --> 02:54:03.660
Enough to be an influence.

02:54:04.660 --> 02:54:06.940
You know, you have to be deaf,

02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:08.300
in some fundamental sense,

02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:10.980
not to encounter a great dead friend,

02:54:10.980 --> 02:54:13.220
and fail to learn.

02:54:13.220 --> 02:54:15.500
No, and I mean, I tried to separate

02:54:15.500 --> 02:54:17.820
the wheat from the chaff when I read,

02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:19.420
and I read all the great clinicians,

02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:21.140
all of them, perhaps not.

02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:25.260
Those who are foremost in the pantheon,

02:54:25.260 --> 02:54:26.980
and I tried to pull out what I could,

02:54:26.980 --> 02:54:27.980
and that was a lot.

02:54:27.980 --> 02:54:29.260
I learned a lot from Freud,

02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:31.100
I learned a lot from Rogers,

02:54:31.100 --> 02:54:32.180
and I learned a lot from,

02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:33.860
well, from Dostoevsky and Nietzsche.

02:54:33.860 --> 02:54:36.140
I'm gonna do a course on Dostoevsky and Nietzsche

02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:37.460
for this Peterson Academy,

02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:39.260
this is coming up in January.

02:54:39.260 --> 02:54:40.260
Oh, that'll be-

02:54:40.260 --> 02:54:41.100
Them together.

02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:41.940
I'm really looking forward to it.

02:54:41.940 --> 02:54:43.980
You're weaving-

02:54:43.980 --> 02:54:45.940
Well, I hadn't thought about doing them together.

02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:46.780
That'd be fun.

02:54:46.780 --> 02:54:47.980
That's a good idea.

02:54:47.980 --> 02:54:48.820
Well-

02:54:48.820 --> 02:54:49.660
That'd be a good idea.

02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:51.060
There's an interesting-

02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:53.140
I'm gonna steal that idea.

02:54:53.140 --> 02:54:55.420
You often weave them together really masterfully,

02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:56.900
because there is a,

02:54:56.900 --> 02:54:59.700
there is religious,

02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:01.300
in the broad sense of that word,

02:55:01.300 --> 02:55:03.660
themes throughout the writing of both.

02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:05.700
You know, there is uncanny parallelisms

02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:07.940
in their writing and their lives.

02:55:07.940 --> 02:55:08.780
So,

02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:12.220
and Dostoevsky is deeper than Nietzsche,

02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:15.620
but that's because he was a writer of fiction.

02:55:15.620 --> 02:55:18.100
Nietzsche is almost the character in a Dostoevsky.

02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:19.660
He is definitely that.

02:55:19.660 --> 02:55:21.420
He is definitely that, yes.

02:55:22.780 --> 02:55:24.860
Apparently Nietzsche knew more about Dostoevsky

02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:25.780
than people had thought.

02:55:25.780 --> 02:55:27.980
There's been some recent scholarship on that grounds.

02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:29.780
Dostoevsky didn't know anything about Nietzsche,

02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:30.940
as far as I know.

02:55:30.940 --> 02:55:32.340
I could be wrong about that.

02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:35.300
But the thing that Dostoevsky had over Nietzsche

02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:37.660
is Nietzsche had to make things propositional

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:38.500
in some real sense,

02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:39.500
because he was a philosopher.

02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:42.420
And it's hard to propositionalize things

02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:44.460
that are outside your ken,

02:55:44.460 --> 02:55:46.460
but you can characterize them.

02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:49.340
And so in the Brothers Karamazov,

02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:54.180
Ivan is a more developed character than Alyosha

02:55:54.180 --> 02:55:56.340
in the explicit sense.

02:55:56.340 --> 02:55:58.100
He can make better arguments.

02:55:58.100 --> 02:56:01.260
But Alyosha wins, like Mishkin,

02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:02.860
because he's the better man.

02:56:02.860 --> 02:56:05.820
And Dostoevsky can show that in the actions.

02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:08.820
He can't render it entirely propositional,

02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:10.260
but that's probably because what's good

02:56:10.260 --> 02:56:12.740
can't be rendered entirely propositional.

02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:14.820
And so Dostoevsky had that edge over Nietzsche.

02:56:14.820 --> 02:56:17.460
He said, well, Ivan is this brilliant rationalist,

02:56:17.460 --> 02:56:19.780
atheist, materialist,

02:56:19.780 --> 02:56:22.140
and puts forward an argument on that front

02:56:22.140 --> 02:56:25.060
that's still unparalleled, as far as I'm concerned,

02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:28.020
and overwhelms Alyosha, who cannot respond,

02:56:28.940 --> 02:56:30.860
but Alyosha is still the better man.

02:56:30.860 --> 02:56:33.780
So, which is very interesting, you know, that.

02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:35.860
You know, the funny thing about those two characters

02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:39.620
is you, Jordan Peterson, seem to be somebody

02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:42.580
that at least in part embodies both,

02:56:42.580 --> 02:56:45.700
because you are one of the intellectuals of our time,

02:56:45.700 --> 02:56:47.820
rigorous in thought,

02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:51.460
but also are able to have that kind of,

02:56:51.460 --> 02:56:52.780
what would you describe?

02:56:52.780 --> 02:56:56.020
If you remove the religiosity of Alyosha,

02:56:56.980 --> 02:56:59.780
there's a, what's a good word?

02:56:59.780 --> 02:57:00.940
Love towards the world.

02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:03.020
Spirit of encouragement.

02:57:03.020 --> 02:57:04.500
Yes.

02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:06.060
Yeah, well, it's, you know,

02:57:06.060 --> 02:57:08.860
one of the things I did learn, perhaps,

02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:10.260
from looking into the abyss

02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:14.860
to the degree that I have had to, or was willing to,

02:57:16.140 --> 02:57:17.420
was that at some level,

02:57:17.420 --> 02:57:20.580
you have to make a fundamental statement of faith.

02:57:20.580 --> 02:57:23.100
When God creates the world, after each day,

02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:25.660
He says, He saw that it was good.

02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:28.180
You think, well, is it good?

02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:29.980
It's like, well, there's a tough question.

02:57:29.980 --> 02:57:32.500
You know, do you want to bring a child into a world

02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:35.100
such as this, which is a fundamental question

02:57:35.100 --> 02:57:36.380
of whether or not it's good?

02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:41.300
It's an act of faith to declare that it's good,

02:57:41.300 --> 02:57:43.180
because the evidence is ambivalent.

02:57:44.460 --> 02:57:46.380
And so then you think, okay, well,

02:57:47.980 --> 02:57:49.580
am I gonna act as if it's good?

02:57:51.220 --> 02:57:52.820
And what would happen if I did?

02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:55.540
And maybe the answer to that is,

02:57:55.540 --> 02:57:56.940
I think this is the answer.

02:58:03.620 --> 02:58:08.340
The more you act out the proposition that it's good,

02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:09.380
the better it gets.

02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:14.780
And so that's, Dostoevsky said, this is something else.

02:58:14.780 --> 02:58:17.660
Every man is not only responsible for everything he does,

02:58:17.660 --> 02:58:20.100
but for everything everyone else does.

02:58:20.100 --> 02:58:22.900
It's like, what, is that profound?

02:58:23.740 --> 02:58:26.620
Is that the answer or are you just insane?

02:58:26.620 --> 02:58:30.860
Then you think, is what you receive back

02:58:30.860 --> 02:58:32.620
proportionate to what you deliver?

02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:35.940
And the answer to that might be yes.

02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:38.420
That's a terrifying idea, man.

02:58:38.420 --> 02:58:40.340
And it's certainly, you can see that it's true

02:58:40.340 --> 02:58:44.780
in some sense, because people certainly respond to you

02:58:44.780 --> 02:58:47.260
in kind with how you treat them.

02:58:47.260 --> 02:58:48.380
That's certainly the case.

02:58:48.380 --> 02:58:51.380
I mean, it's terrifying and it's exciting.

02:58:51.380 --> 02:58:52.220
Yeah, right.

02:58:52.900 --> 02:58:57.900
You, yeah, you create the world by the way you live it.

02:59:00.700 --> 02:59:03.380
The world you experience is defined

02:59:03.380 --> 02:59:05.060
by the way you live that world.

02:59:05.060 --> 02:59:06.860
And that's really interesting.

02:59:06.860 --> 02:59:08.460
And then taken as a collective,

02:59:08.460 --> 02:59:10.700
we create the world together in that way.

02:59:10.700 --> 02:59:12.900
What do you think is the meaning of it all?

02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:15.180
What's the meaning of life, Jordan Peterson?

02:59:16.100 --> 02:59:18.140
We've defined it many, many times

02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:18.980
throughout this conversation.

02:59:18.980 --> 02:59:21.020
It's the adventure along the route, man.

02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:26.700
And I would say, where's that adventure to be found?

02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:29.500
In faith, what's the faith?

02:59:29.500 --> 02:59:32.500
The highest value is love and truth is its handmaiden.

02:59:34.820 --> 02:59:36.540
That's a statement of faith, right?

02:59:36.540 --> 02:59:40.540
Cause you can't tell, you have to act it out

02:59:40.540 --> 02:59:42.500
to see if it's true.

02:59:43.340 --> 02:59:45.980
And so you can't even find out without,

02:59:45.980 --> 02:59:47.580
and that's so peculiar.

02:59:47.580 --> 02:59:50.500
You have to make the commitment a priori.

02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:51.620
It's like a marriage.

02:59:51.620 --> 02:59:52.700
It's the same thing.

02:59:53.620 --> 02:59:56.820
It's like, well, is this the person for me?

02:59:56.820 --> 02:59:58.100
That's the wrong question.

02:59:59.420 --> 03:00:01.820
How do I find out if this is the person for me?

03:00:02.980 --> 03:00:05.260
By binding myself to them.

03:00:07.140 --> 03:00:09.260
Well, maybe the same thing is true of life, right?

03:00:09.260 --> 03:00:10.700
You bind yourself to it.

03:00:11.540 --> 03:00:13.420
And that tighter you bind yourself to it,

03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:15.620
the more you find out what it is.

03:00:15.620 --> 03:00:18.060
And that's like a radical embrace.

03:00:18.060 --> 03:00:20.020
And it's a really radical embrace.

03:00:20.020 --> 03:00:21.260
That's the crucifix symbol.

03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:23.620
And more than that, because like I said,

03:00:23.620 --> 03:00:27.100
the full passion story isn't death.

03:00:27.100 --> 03:00:29.260
It isn't even unjust death.

03:00:29.260 --> 03:00:31.420
It isn't even unjust death

03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:34.100
and the crucifixion of the innocent,

03:00:34.100 --> 03:00:36.380
which is really getting pretty bad.

03:00:36.380 --> 03:00:41.380
It's unjust, torturous, innocent death,

03:00:43.060 --> 03:00:47.380
attendant upon betrayal and tyranny, followed by hell.

03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:51.460
Well, that's a hell of a thing to radically embrace.

03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:52.620
It's like bring it on.

03:00:54.180 --> 03:00:58.740
I think a lot of people put truth as the highest ideal

03:00:58.740 --> 03:01:03.740
and think they can get to that ideal

03:01:03.740 --> 03:01:05.900
while living in a place of cynicism

03:01:05.900 --> 03:01:08.700
and ultimately escape from life and hiding from life,

03:01:08.700 --> 03:01:10.020
afraid of life.

03:01:10.020 --> 03:01:13.940
And it's beautifully put that love

03:01:13.940 --> 03:01:18.100
is the highest ideal to reach for and truth is-

03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:19.420
It's handmade.

03:01:19.420 --> 03:01:21.060
I thought about that for a long time, right?

03:01:21.060 --> 03:01:22.980
This hierarchy of ideal.

03:01:22.980 --> 03:01:25.540
And the thing about truth, that bitter truth, let's say,

03:01:25.540 --> 03:01:30.540
that cynical truth is it can break the shackles of naivety.

03:01:31.140 --> 03:01:36.140
And actually a burnt cynicism is a moral improvement

03:01:36.780 --> 03:01:41.780
over a blind naivety, even though one is in some ways

03:01:42.060 --> 03:01:44.180
positive, but only because it's protected.

03:01:44.180 --> 03:01:48.060
And the other is bitter and dark, but still better.

03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:49.500
But you're not done at that point.

03:01:49.500 --> 03:01:51.300
You're just barely started.

03:01:51.300 --> 03:01:53.100
It's like you're cynical.

03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:54.460
You're not cynical enough.

03:01:55.500 --> 03:01:57.060
It's like, how cynical are you?

03:01:57.060 --> 03:02:00.940
Are you, I'm an Auschwitz prison guard level of cynical?

03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:05.540
Because you have to go down pretty deep into the weeds

03:02:05.540 --> 03:02:07.220
before you find that part of you,

03:02:07.220 --> 03:02:09.420
but you can find it if you want.

03:02:09.420 --> 03:02:11.860
And then you think, well, I want to stop this.

03:02:13.100 --> 03:02:15.100
Well, that was the question you posed in some sense.

03:02:15.100 --> 03:02:16.700
You're obsessed with say what happened

03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:21.380
on these mass scale catastrophes in the communist countries.

03:02:21.380 --> 03:02:24.780
It's like, well, millions of people participated.

03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:29.020
So you could have, and maybe you would have enjoyed it.

03:02:29.020 --> 03:02:30.980
So what part of that is you?

03:02:30.980 --> 03:02:33.500
And you can find it if you want.

03:02:34.860 --> 03:02:36.180
Yeah, it's all there.

03:02:36.180 --> 03:02:39.220
The prisoner, the interrogator, the-

03:02:40.060 --> 03:02:42.740
The Judas, Pontius Pilate.

03:02:42.740 --> 03:02:43.580
All of it.

03:02:43.580 --> 03:02:44.420
All of it.

03:02:44.420 --> 03:02:46.180
All of it is inside us.

03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:47.020
Yeah.

03:02:47.020 --> 03:02:48.860
And you just have to look.

03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:52.700
And once you do, maybe eventually you can find the love.

03:02:52.700 --> 03:02:54.620
Jordan, you're an incredible human being.

03:02:54.620 --> 03:02:56.980
I'm deeply honored you would talk to me.

03:02:56.980 --> 03:02:59.780
Thank you for being a truth seeker in this world

03:02:59.780 --> 03:03:01.580
and thank you for the love.

03:03:01.580 --> 03:03:04.100
Hey, thanks for the invitation, man.

03:03:05.060 --> 03:03:06.620
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:03:06.620 --> 03:03:07.900
with Jordan Peterson.

03:03:13.780 --> 03:03:15.140
from Friedrich Nietzsche.

03:03:16.140 --> 03:03:18.180
You must have chaos within you

03:03:18.180 --> 03:03:20.460
to give birth to a dancing star.
