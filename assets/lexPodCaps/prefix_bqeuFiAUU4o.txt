00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
If you have a democratic style of governance,

00:03.120 --> 00:06.720
you are entrusting people with one of the most awesome

00:06.720 --> 00:08.360
and radical of responsibilities.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.400
And that's saying that you're going to pick the people

00:10.400 --> 00:11.960
that are gonna make some of the hardest decisions

00:11.960 --> 00:13.240
in all of human history.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.960
If you're gonna trust people to vote correctly,

00:15.960 --> 00:17.640
you have to be able to trust them to have open

00:17.640 --> 00:19.020
and honest dialogue with each other.

00:19.020 --> 00:22.720
Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,

00:22.720 --> 00:25.320
you have to believe that your people are going to be able

00:25.320 --> 00:27.560
to rise above and make the correct determinations

00:27.560 --> 00:29.360
when they hear these types of speeches.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.040
And if you're so worried that somebody is gonna hear

00:32.040 --> 00:33.120
a certain political figure

00:33.120 --> 00:35.280
and they're gonna be completely radicalized instantly,

00:35.280 --> 00:37.400
then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith

00:37.400 --> 00:40.040
in humans for democracy to be a viable institution,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.000
which is fine.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.360
You can be anti-democratic,

00:42.360 --> 00:44.200
but I don't think you can be pro-democracy

00:44.200 --> 00:45.520
and anti-free speech.

00:48.100 --> 00:51.360
The following is a conversation with Stephen Bonnell,

00:51.360 --> 00:53.600
also known online as Destiny.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.720
He's a video game streamer and political commentator,

00:56.720 --> 00:58.960
one of the early pioneers of both live streaming

00:58.960 --> 01:02.680
in general and live streamed political debate and discourse.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.200
Politically, he is a progressive,

01:05.200 --> 01:08.000
identifying as either left or far left,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
depending on your perspective.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.840
There are many reasons I wanted to talk to Stephen.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.880
First, I just talked to Ben Shapiro,

01:14.880 --> 01:17.600
and many people have told me that Stephen

01:17.600 --> 01:20.320
is the Ben Shapiro of the left

01:20.320 --> 01:22.000
in terms of political perspective

01:22.000 --> 01:24.880
and exceptional debate skills.

01:24.920 --> 01:28.040
Second reason is he skillfully defends

01:28.040 --> 01:31.080
some nuanced non-standard views,

01:31.080 --> 01:33.400
at the same time being pro-establishment,

01:33.400 --> 01:35.680
pro-institutions and pro-Biden,

01:35.680 --> 01:39.480
while also being pro-capitalism and pro-free speech.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.400
Third reason is he has been there at the beginning

01:43.400 --> 01:45.600
and throughout the meteoric rise

01:45.600 --> 01:48.120
of the video game live streaming community.

01:48.120 --> 01:50.080
In some mainstream circles,

01:50.080 --> 01:52.720
this community is not taken seriously,

01:52.720 --> 01:55.760
perhaps because of its demographic distribution

01:55.760 --> 01:56.960
skewing young,

01:56.960 --> 01:59.240
or perhaps because of the sometimes

01:59.240 --> 02:01.640
harsh style of communication.

02:01.640 --> 02:05.320
But I think this community should be taken seriously

02:05.320 --> 02:07.240
and shown respect.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.560
Millions of young minds tune into live streams

02:09.560 --> 02:12.640
like Destiny's to question and to try to understand

02:12.640 --> 02:14.320
what is going on with the world,

02:14.320 --> 02:18.240
often exploring challenging, even controversial ideas.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.960
The language is sometimes harsher

02:19.960 --> 02:22.880
and the humor sometimes meaner than I would prefer.

02:22.880 --> 02:27.400
But I, Grandpa Lex, put on my rain boots

02:27.400 --> 02:29.560
and went into the beautiful chaotic muck

02:29.560 --> 02:31.160
of online discourse

02:31.160 --> 02:34.120
and have so far survived to tell the tale

02:34.120 --> 02:37.960
with a smile and even more love in my heart than before.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.640
On top of all this,

02:40.640 --> 02:43.480
we were lucky to have Melina Goranson,

02:43.480 --> 02:45.880
a popular streamer and world traveler,

02:45.880 --> 02:48.040
join us at the end of the conversation.

02:48.040 --> 02:52.080
You can check out her channel on twitch.tv slash Melina,

02:52.080 --> 02:54.160
and you can check out Steven's channel

02:54.160 --> 02:57.120
on youtube.com slash Destiny.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.120
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

02:59.120 --> 02:59.960
To support it,

02:59.960 --> 03:02.480
please check out our sponsors in the description.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.200
And now, dear friends, here's Destiny.

03:06.200 --> 03:09.320
I don't know if you watched me watching your yay interview.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.800
Yeah, thank you so much.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.720
I'm so curious,

03:11.720 --> 03:14.520
when you're navigating a conversation like that,

03:14.520 --> 03:16.720
are you, how intentional is the thought process

03:16.720 --> 03:19.520
between like building rapport and pushing

03:19.520 --> 03:21.160
and giving a little and letting like-

03:21.160 --> 03:23.200
Zero, zero intention.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.680
I was watching and thank you so much.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.960
It was very kind for you to review that conversation.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.280
It meant a lot that you were complimenting parts

03:30.280 --> 03:32.240
on the technical aspects of the conversation,

03:32.240 --> 03:33.320
but no, zero.

03:33.320 --> 03:37.560
And I'm actually deliberately trying to avoid,

03:37.560 --> 03:39.480
I think you've called it debate brain,

03:40.560 --> 03:45.560
which is just another flavor of thinking about

03:45.800 --> 03:47.200
like the meta conversation,

03:47.200 --> 03:50.480
trying to optimize how should this conversation go?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.680
Because I feel like the more you do that,

03:53.680 --> 03:55.680
the better you get at that,

03:55.680 --> 03:57.840
the less human connection you have.

03:57.840 --> 04:00.040
Like the less genuinely you're actually sitting there

04:00.040 --> 04:01.840
in the moment and listening to the person,

04:01.840 --> 04:04.360
you're more like calculating what's the right thing to say

04:04.360 --> 04:08.200
versus like feeling what is that person feeling right now?

04:08.200 --> 04:09.280
What are they thinking?

04:09.280 --> 04:12.240
That's what I'm trying to do is like putting myself

04:12.240 --> 04:13.800
in their mind and thinking,

04:13.800 --> 04:15.600
what does the world look like to them?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.920
What does the world feel like to them?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.440
And so from that, I truly try to listen.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.280
Now I'm also learning,

04:22.280 --> 04:25.240
especially because Rogan and others have been giving me shit

04:25.240 --> 04:27.000
for not pushing back.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.440
It's good sometimes to say from a place of care

04:31.440 --> 04:33.840
for the other human being to say, stop.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.200
What did you just say?

04:36.200 --> 04:39.440
I don't think that's represents who you are

04:39.440 --> 04:40.800
and what you really mean.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.480
Or maybe if it does at that time represents who they are,

04:45.480 --> 04:48.560
I could see a better world

04:48.560 --> 04:50.120
if they grow into a different direction

04:50.120 --> 04:52.160
and try to point that direction out to them.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.640
There's a really complicated dance

04:53.640 --> 04:56.640
between letting somebody share their full story

04:56.640 --> 04:58.680
versus letting somebody like essentially,

04:58.680 --> 05:00.560
I guess like proselytize your audience.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.640
And it's like, okay, hold on, let's take him in here.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.200
But yeah, I used to be four or five years ago,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.080
it was attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,

05:08.080 --> 05:09.080
whatever you said.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.000
And now I'm leaning way more towards they're like,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.600
okay, well, tell me how you feel about everything

05:12.600 --> 05:13.440
and then we'll go from there.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.400
So a lot of people like my new approach,

05:15.400 --> 05:16.800
some older fans will watch and they're like,

05:16.800 --> 05:18.200
why are you letting this guy just ramble on?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.080
You know, he said like five or six wrong things

05:20.080 --> 05:21.400
and you're only gonna call them out on two of them.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.200
And it's like, it's just different styles of conversation.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.360
Do you do a lot of research beforehand too?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.600
Depending on the conversation, yeah.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.160
So if we're gonna talk like vaccines and stuff,

05:29.160 --> 05:31.000
yeah, that's a ton of reading and stuff

05:31.000 --> 05:33.720
that I never thought I'd know going into it.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.560
If it's a more personal,

05:34.560 --> 05:36.240
like political philosophy conversation,

05:36.240 --> 05:37.720
there's not as much you can prepare for just,

05:37.720 --> 05:39.320
it truly depends on the conversation.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.080
How much are you actually listening to the other person?

05:42.080 --> 05:43.440
I'm always listening, you have to listen

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
because as soon as you stop listening,

05:44.440 --> 05:46.320
the quality of everything falls apart,

05:46.320 --> 05:47.200
the connection disappears,

05:47.200 --> 05:49.080
the quality of the conversation disappears.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.240
But my natural inclination

05:50.240 --> 05:52.880
is to just be way more aggressive than normal.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.520
So I have to constantly remind myself,

05:54.520 --> 05:55.960
I guess you would call it a meta conversation,

05:55.960 --> 05:56.800
when you're like, okay,

05:56.800 --> 05:58.160
he's probably saying this because of that

05:58.160 --> 06:00.200
or we'll let him go here and then we'll stop later.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.440
But yeah, because my preferred style of conversation

06:03.440 --> 06:04.520
is like, I'm gonna talk

06:04.520 --> 06:06.280
and the second I say something you disagree with,

06:06.280 --> 06:08.720
then let's iron it out, right?

06:08.720 --> 06:10.160
Like I think in like syllogisms,

06:10.160 --> 06:13.200
like, okay, here's premise A, good, okay,

06:13.200 --> 06:15.320
premise B, okay, and then conclusion.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.280
And then as long as we're both deductively sound,

06:17.280 --> 06:18.680
we're not crazy, no psychosis,

06:18.680 --> 06:20.320
then we're gonna agree on everything.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.440
Whereas other people like to,

06:21.440 --> 06:23.480
most people think in stories, like narratives,

06:23.480 --> 06:25.040
like a whole, there's a whole like narrative

06:25.040 --> 06:27.280
and the individual facts don't matter as much

06:27.280 --> 06:28.520
because they'll pick and choose what they want.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.240
And it's really hard

06:30.240 --> 06:31.080
because everybody thinks narratives

06:31.080 --> 06:32.680
so I have to function in that world,

06:32.680 --> 06:34.800
but it's frustrating for me sometimes.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.720
Well, I've seen, you've had a lot of excellent debates.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.000
One of them I just recently last night watched

06:40.000 --> 06:42.680
is on systemic racism.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.920
And it's the first time I've seen you

06:44.920 --> 06:46.320
completely lose your shit.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.800
Oh, shoot, who was that against?

06:47.800 --> 06:48.720
I'm not sure exactly,

06:48.720 --> 06:50.600
but you were just very frustrated and sorry,

06:50.600 --> 06:52.920
not lose your shit, but you were frustrated constantly

06:52.920 --> 06:55.800
because of the thing, let's lay out one, two, three,

06:55.800 --> 06:59.320
and every time you try to lay it out, it would falter.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.160
I think it had to do with sort of,

07:01.160 --> 07:03.560
can you use data to make an argument

07:03.600 --> 07:04.960
or do you need to use a study

07:04.960 --> 07:07.360
that does an interpretation of that data?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.240
And then there's like this tension between,

07:09.240 --> 07:11.040
I think this is a behavioral economist

07:11.040 --> 07:12.400
that you were talking to in there.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.840
The point is you do this kind of nice layout

07:14.840 --> 07:16.440
that the whole point of behavioral economics

07:16.440 --> 07:19.120
that says there's more to it than just the data.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.280
You have to give a context and like do the rich,

07:22.280 --> 07:24.520
rigorous interpretation in the context

07:24.520 --> 07:26.160
of the full human story.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.840
And then there was like a dance back and forth.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.480
Sometimes you use data, sometimes not,

07:29.480 --> 07:32.520
and you were getting really frustrated and shutting down.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.640
And so that felt like a failure mode.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.600
I've seen Sam Harris have similar sticking points.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.920
Like if we can't agree on the terminology, we can't go on.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.920
To me, I feel like sort of the Wittgenstein perspective

07:47.280 --> 07:51.240
is like, I think if you get stuck on any one thing,

07:51.240 --> 07:52.520
you're just not gonna make progress.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.880
You have to, part of the conversation has to be

07:56.800 --> 08:00.560
about doing a good dance together

08:01.440 --> 08:05.840
versus being dogmatically stuck on the path to truth.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.560
I think the true challenge is identifying

08:08.560 --> 08:10.880
what of those sticking points are important

08:10.880 --> 08:14.800
versus what is not important.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.160
It's like, if I'm having an argument with somebody

08:16.160 --> 08:19.120
about like Jewish representation and media,

08:19.120 --> 08:21.240
it might be like a big conversation

08:21.240 --> 08:23.000
and they might say a couple things.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.360
Like I think Jewish people,

08:24.360 --> 08:26.160
they tend to help their own or whatever and it's like,

08:26.160 --> 08:28.280
okay, but like for the purpose of the conversation,

08:28.280 --> 08:29.320
we can keep moving.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.240
But if they casually drop like, yeah,

08:31.240 --> 08:33.040
and I think that's why the Holocaust numbers

08:33.040 --> 08:35.080
are blown up from like 100,000 to six million

08:35.080 --> 08:36.360
and that's when it's like, okay, well, hold on, wait, wait.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.040
If you think this, we have to stop here

08:38.040 --> 08:40.000
because this is gonna be,

08:40.000 --> 08:41.560
it's not just a language game in this part.

08:41.560 --> 08:43.080
If you really believe this fact,

08:43.080 --> 08:44.480
then the whole rest of the conversation

08:44.480 --> 08:46.840
is gonna be informed by that belief.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.840
And it has to be something

08:47.840 --> 08:50.680
that doesn't bother you personally.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.040
You have to step outside your own ego.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.920
So Holocaust denial is somebody

08:54.920 --> 08:56.680
that would bother a lot of people.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.920
And there's some things just observing you.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.320
I feel like when you get really good at conversation,

09:02.320 --> 09:05.720
you can become a stickler to,

09:05.720 --> 09:07.560
you might have your favorite terms

09:07.560 --> 09:08.720
that really bothers you.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.560
People don't agree on those terms.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.600
Begs the question.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.800
You mean raising the question.

09:12.800 --> 09:13.800
Yeah, I usually just want,

09:13.800 --> 09:16.280
people say stuff, I just let it slide, yeah.

09:16.280 --> 09:17.480
Cause if you fight,

09:17.480 --> 09:19.040
when you're having a conversation with somebody

09:19.040 --> 09:20.560
and you're talking to their audience at the same time,

09:20.560 --> 09:21.920
cause that's really what's happening.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.640
You never wanna come off as over combative

09:23.640 --> 09:26.320
or over aggressive because it puts people in like,

09:26.960 --> 09:28.000
there's like a trigger in your brain.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.480
And this is true of relationships,

09:29.480 --> 09:31.560
of friendships, of persuasive rhetoric or whatever.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.400
There's a trigger in the brain.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.680
And as soon as that defensive trigger gets flipped on,

09:34.680 --> 09:35.520
everything is over.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.240
You've lost the ability to persuade

09:37.240 --> 09:39.600
because everything becomes a fight at that point, yeah.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.080
Well, I wanted to talk to you

09:41.080 --> 09:44.280
cause I heard somewhere that you were referred to

09:44.280 --> 09:45.520
as the Ben Shapiro of the left.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.440
And since I'm talking with Ben as well,

09:48.440 --> 09:51.360
I wanted to sort of complete spiritually

09:51.360 --> 09:55.160
this platonic political philosophy puzzle in my head.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.120
You are a progressive,

09:57.120 --> 10:00.320
but a progressive with many non-standard progressive views.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.320
And you had a heck of a fascinating journey

10:02.320 --> 10:03.160
through all of that.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.000
And like I said,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.200
I think you argue with passion sometimes

10:07.200 --> 10:09.160
with excessive amounts of passion.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.000
But almost-

10:10.000 --> 10:11.240
That's a really polite way of saying that.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.960
Almost always with good faith

10:13.960 --> 10:16.280
and with rigor, with seriousness.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.560
I asked on your subreddit,

10:17.560 --> 10:18.920
which is an excellent subreddit,

10:18.920 --> 10:22.120
shout out to the destiny subreddit.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.080
So much, at least for that particular post.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.920
What I really loved is when I asked for questions for you,

10:27.920 --> 10:29.000
they were like, holy shit,

10:29.000 --> 10:31.560
there's adults in there, let's all behave.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.680
Nobody say incest.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.200
I was like, what was going on here?

10:35.200 --> 10:38.000
But actually the questions that rose to the top

10:38.000 --> 10:38.840
were really good.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.880
So somebody said that destiny was,

10:41.880 --> 10:43.200
speaking of your journey,

10:43.200 --> 10:45.920
was a conservative in his early teens.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.160
Then he became a libertarian.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.640
Then he became a left-wing social justice warrior.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.000
Then he flirted with socialism

10:53.000 --> 10:55.800
and now he is a social democrat liberal.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.760
I've also heard you refer to yourself as a far left person.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.280
So to the degree there's truth to that journey,

11:02.280 --> 11:04.880
can you take me through your evolution

11:04.880 --> 11:07.760
through the landscape of political ideologies

11:07.760 --> 11:08.600
that you went through?

11:08.600 --> 11:11.440
So my dad comes from Kentucky

11:11.440 --> 11:14.800
and my mom is a Cuban immigrant.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.520
Cubans are notorious for being very conservative

11:17.520 --> 11:20.480
in the United States for historical reasons

11:21.320 --> 11:22.160
and for other reasons,

11:22.160 --> 11:24.800
but my upbringing was a very Republican one.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.200
I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck,

11:28.200 --> 11:32.400
Michael Savage, on the radio, Billy Cunningham,

11:32.400 --> 11:34.360
I think Sean Hannity a little bit later on,

11:34.360 --> 11:36.480
that was my whole upbringing politically.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.440
I remember I was writing,

11:38.440 --> 11:40.240
I had written articles for the school journal

11:40.240 --> 11:42.680
in favor of defending the war in Iraq

11:42.680 --> 11:45.040
and defending Bush from all the criticism, et cetera.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.600
So that was my upbringing.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.120
I think once I hit high school college,

11:50.760 --> 11:53.320
I had my edgy like libertarian-esque high school phase

11:53.320 --> 11:57.120
of like reading Ayn Rand of figuring out that like,

11:57.120 --> 11:58.560
oh my God, nothing in life matters

11:58.560 --> 11:59.640
except for class and money.

11:59.640 --> 12:00.960
That's actually the answer to everything.

12:00.960 --> 12:04.560
And I got to college, I became a Ron Paul fan,

12:04.560 --> 12:06.160
very big Ron Paul fan.

12:06.160 --> 12:10.600
And then from there, I kind of work, do life,

12:10.600 --> 12:13.520
life happens at the kind of the lowest point of my life

12:13.520 --> 12:14.520
in terms of where I'm working.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.360
Financially, everything is like kind of in ruin in my life.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.080
There's just a whole bunch of dumb stuff that's happened.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.800
Probably my most conservative point.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.880
I don't know what it is about like being poor

12:21.880 --> 12:23.480
and thinking like you can work your way out of it,

12:23.480 --> 12:24.320
you can do whatever.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.480
It's just my upbringing is always just like,

12:25.480 --> 12:28.200
if you're not having financial success,

12:28.200 --> 12:30.440
just work, work, work, work, work.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.560
And then I got into streaming, very, very lucky break.

12:32.560 --> 12:33.880
Everything just lined up at the right time.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.680
And then as I've progressed through streaming,

12:35.680 --> 12:36.640
I would say through the years,

12:36.640 --> 12:38.920
I've gradually fallen more and more to the left,

12:38.920 --> 12:42.280
especially once my kid turned four or five, six years old.

12:42.280 --> 12:45.440
And I started to see like how much different his life was

12:45.440 --> 12:47.000
just because of the financial opportunities

12:47.000 --> 12:48.240
that I was able to provide for him

12:48.240 --> 12:49.720
through no merit of his own.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.960
And that started to radically change

12:51.960 --> 12:52.800
how I viewed the world in a lot of ways.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.840
So actually let's like linger on that low point.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.920
You worked at McDonald's, you worked at a casino,

12:59.920 --> 13:01.840
you did carpet cleaning.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.000
What was the lowest point?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.600
Definitely the carpet cleaning.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.420
Really?

13:06.420 --> 13:07.260
Absolutely.

13:07.260 --> 13:08.720
Why was it the lowest point?

13:08.720 --> 13:12.000
That's when you were just flirting with starting streaming?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.200
My whole life has been a series of lucky breaks,

13:14.200 --> 13:15.320
really, truly.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.560
I grew up playing a lot of video games,

13:17.560 --> 13:21.280
but back in my day, our day, you had to read.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.480
There was a lot of text on the screen.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.320
Back in my day, we used to play.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.400
They didn't all talk to you.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.200
Yeah, because nowadays everything's voice acted,

13:27.200 --> 13:28.760
but back then you had to read a lot.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.920
I was a really good reader and a really good vocabular.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.080
Yeah, I've heard you actually say that.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.480
What games are we talking about?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.080
What do you mean just reading?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.120
You're talking about like RPGs?

13:36.120 --> 13:36.960
Yeah, JRPGs.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.920
So like Final Fantasy games, Fantasy stars,

13:38.920 --> 13:40.800
like all of these, like any RPG that would have been

13:40.800 --> 13:43.720
on the SNES, Sega, PlayStation, these are the things.

13:43.720 --> 13:44.840
Let's pause on that.

13:44.840 --> 13:45.680
Okay.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.240
You just talked to Todd Howard,

13:47.240 --> 13:52.240
who's of the Elder Scrolls fame and the Fallout fame

13:52.760 --> 13:54.360
and beyond.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.560
What's your thoughts on Elder Scrolls?

13:56.560 --> 13:59.480
Why is Skyrim the greatest RPG of all time?

13:59.480 --> 14:02.240
Man, I really don't like Skyrim or Fallout.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.080
You don't love it?

14:03.080 --> 14:03.900
Oh, really?

14:03.900 --> 14:04.740
No, not at all.

14:04.740 --> 14:05.680
Why do you hate Skyrim?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.960
Yeah, so I really like characters

14:07.960 --> 14:09.480
and like compelling stories and narratives

14:09.480 --> 14:10.520
around those characters.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.320
And I like to see them kind of like grow and change,

14:12.320 --> 14:14.040
kind of like a movie or a story.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.440
So in your like Final Fantasy games, you've got characters.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.620
There are a lot of like classical tropes

14:20.620 --> 14:23.300
of like a character starts off kind of like edgy angsty

14:23.300 --> 14:24.140
all on their own.

14:24.140 --> 14:25.640
They develop relationships, friendships.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.920
They realize that the life is more about themselves

14:27.920 --> 14:28.760
and they do that.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.840
And I like that growth.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.660
That's kind of what you see

14:30.660 --> 14:32.760
in all of those old role-playing games.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.240
I didn't like the open world ones as much

14:34.240 --> 14:35.920
because your main character is just like a blank slate,

14:35.920 --> 14:36.740
never talks.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.240
It's for you to like project onto,

14:38.240 --> 14:40.920
but there's not the same like linear narrative

14:40.920 --> 14:41.760
of like growth for the character.

14:41.760 --> 14:42.600
Oh, that's fascinating.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.400
There's an actual story arc to the character

14:45.400 --> 14:47.680
that's more crafted in a beautiful way

14:47.680 --> 14:48.840
by the designers of the game.

14:48.840 --> 14:49.680
Yeah.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.500
I don't think one is better or worse.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.400
I tend towards like, I wanna hear a compelling story

14:52.400 --> 14:53.640
around like a set of characters

14:53.640 --> 14:54.760
that like grow and change as the game goes on.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.920
Oh, that's beautifully put then.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.120
Yeah, I just really loved being able to leave the town.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.880
You go outside the town and you look outside its nature

15:02.880 --> 15:05.200
and the world of possibilities is before you.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.080
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.480
I mean, that immensity of just being lost in the world

15:10.480 --> 15:11.540
is really immersive for me.

15:11.540 --> 15:12.380
But yeah, you're right.

15:13.220 --> 15:14.660
Whatever attracts you about a world.

15:14.660 --> 15:19.140
So you were just starting to play video games.

15:19.140 --> 15:20.260
You go out, play the video games.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.180
That's one of your lucky breaks.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.060
There's just like a lot of random skills you pick up

15:24.060 --> 15:25.760
depending on the type of game you play.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.940
I played a lot of text-based games on the computer.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.620
So I was a very fast typer.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.020
I'm still a very fast typer.

15:31.980 --> 15:34.660
Read a lot, you know, learned weird kind of math stuff

15:34.660 --> 15:36.740
for some of the calculations, some of the games.

15:36.740 --> 15:39.540
I think I'm pretty good at getting information,

15:39.540 --> 15:42.260
figuring stuff out, learning patterns, all of that.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.940
Plus the reading and everything with the games

15:44.940 --> 15:47.460
meant that I, I don't want to say I excelled in school

15:47.460 --> 15:48.980
because my grades were pretty bad,

15:48.980 --> 15:51.900
but I was in like all honors, all AP classes or whatever.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.380
A lot of dual enrollment, a lot of AP credit

15:53.380 --> 15:54.220
going into college.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.900
So I did pretty well in school.

15:55.900 --> 15:56.900
Probably better than I should have,

15:56.900 --> 15:58.220
but it was because I had the game stuff

15:58.220 --> 16:00.380
that was like really powering a lot of my brain there

16:00.380 --> 16:02.400
while I was trying to sleep through class.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.220
So you're able to soak in information,

16:04.220 --> 16:06.620
integrate it, quickly take notes.

16:06.620 --> 16:09.060
Generally, I think I'm pretty good at that, yeah.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.200
You do this a lot when you stream your typing stuff.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.480
Is there a system in that note taking?

16:13.480 --> 16:16.480
And what note, what do you use for note taking?

16:16.480 --> 16:17.320
Does it matter?

16:17.320 --> 16:19.240
I use a notepad.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.880
Like notepad.exe notepad?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.480
Yeah, notepad.exe, not the plus plus, not.

16:23.480 --> 16:26.320
Is there genius to the madness behind that

16:26.320 --> 16:27.640
or you just don't give a shit?

16:27.640 --> 16:29.480
No, I mean like, it's going to depend

16:29.480 --> 16:30.820
on the style of conversation.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.980
If I'm with somebody that is very meticulously

16:32.980 --> 16:35.620
organized their thoughts and they're a,

16:35.620 --> 16:36.920
find a better word here for rambler,

16:36.920 --> 16:38.600
you can edit that in, better word for rambler.

16:38.600 --> 16:39.820
Somebody that talks a lot and a lot,

16:39.860 --> 16:42.300
I'll start like taking notes, bullet points,

16:42.300 --> 16:43.900
like this, this, this, this, this, this, this,

16:43.900 --> 16:45.980
because there's a style of conversation

16:45.980 --> 16:47.980
where I say seven or eight different things

16:47.980 --> 16:49.740
and then when you go to respond to everything I said,

16:49.740 --> 16:51.980
I cut you off immediately and we argue that point.

16:51.980 --> 16:52.820
But if somebody's going to do that,

16:52.820 --> 16:55.060
he's just like, hold on, you just said these eight things,

16:55.060 --> 16:56.640
I'm going to respond to every single one.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.260
I've written them all down and then you can go,

16:58.260 --> 16:59.720
if you want to go point by point, we can,

16:59.720 --> 17:00.980
but you just said all this and I wrote it down,

17:00.980 --> 17:01.820
so we're going to go.

17:01.820 --> 17:02.660
So what are you actually writing down

17:02.660 --> 17:05.440
like a couple of words per point they left?

17:05.440 --> 17:08.060
Honestly, like there are very few unique conversations

17:08.060 --> 17:09.460
in politics, like a lot of them are kind of

17:09.460 --> 17:10.300
retreading old grounds.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.780
So if we're having a debate on abortion,

17:12.780 --> 17:14.220
somebody might say like, oh, well,

17:14.220 --> 17:15.780
I believe this thing about viability

17:15.780 --> 17:17.080
and I believe this thing about, you know,

17:17.080 --> 17:18.620
when they're a fetus versus a human

17:18.620 --> 17:19.940
and I'll just write down like those points

17:19.940 --> 17:21.660
so that when I go to respond, I kind of have like a,

17:21.660 --> 17:23.140
like note cards, like a guiding thing there

17:23.140 --> 17:25.440
to keep me centered on my response.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.420
Political discourse is the kind of tree you're walking down.

17:27.420 --> 17:28.260
I got it.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.100
And you're like taking.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.220
Just to keep my focus guided.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.900
So I'm not like running off on a weird tangent

17:32.900 --> 17:34.540
or responding to something I didn't say or something.

17:34.540 --> 17:36.340
What about like doing research?

17:36.340 --> 17:38.980
It's just, is there a system to your note taking?

17:38.980 --> 17:41.660
Because mentally you seem to be one of the most

17:41.660 --> 17:43.060
organized people I've listened to.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.540
So is there, is it in your mind

17:45.540 --> 17:47.660
or is there a system that's on paper?

17:47.660 --> 17:48.860
A little of both.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.620
I feel like the human mind is a beautiful thing

17:51.620 --> 17:53.740
if you have interest in an area.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.780
So like what I'll tell people is,

17:55.780 --> 17:57.460
let's say there's like a totally new topic

17:57.460 --> 17:58.280
that I'm researching.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.120
I don't know anything.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.140
And I'll do a couple of these on stream.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.820
I think they're boring, but people watch it.

18:01.820 --> 18:04.020
I might open a Wikipedia article and I'll read

18:04.020 --> 18:05.060
and I hit something I don't know.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.680
And then I open the next Wikipedia article

18:06.680 --> 18:07.520
and I'll read it.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.900
And then I might have like seven tabs open

18:09.900 --> 18:11.180
and I'll read and I'll read and I'll read.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.980
And I'll read a ton of stuff maybe for hour two, three,

18:12.980 --> 18:14.260
four hours of stuff.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.980
And then by the end, you know, someone in chat will ask me

18:15.980 --> 18:18.380
like, do you even remember like this particular thing?

18:18.380 --> 18:21.100
And I'll say, not really, no, not too much.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.420
But what happens is, as long as you've seen it once,

18:23.420 --> 18:25.220
what'll happen is like the next day of the day after

18:25.220 --> 18:26.580
we'll read something else and we'll be like,

18:26.580 --> 18:28.940
oh, I remember that thing from this thing.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.100
I remember like vaguely that.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.340
And then if you see it like a third time,

18:31.340 --> 18:32.860
you're like, oh, this makes sense

18:32.860 --> 18:35.300
because especially when it comes to,

18:35.300 --> 18:37.140
oh, here's like a little trick on stuff.

18:37.140 --> 18:38.740
If you're ever reading any news

18:38.740 --> 18:40.660
and there's a place that pops up,

18:40.660 --> 18:41.940
always look at it on a map

18:41.940 --> 18:44.260
because so much of history is like on a map.

18:44.260 --> 18:45.940
It's so important to like know the geography.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.540
It makes things make so much more sense.

18:48.540 --> 18:51.060
But yeah, once I start to see stuff over and over again,

18:51.060 --> 18:52.740
just because I've like read it a few times,

18:52.740 --> 18:54.620
stuff will start to kind of connect to my mind and like,

18:54.620 --> 18:55.540
oh yeah, well, this makes sense.

18:55.540 --> 18:57.740
Of course, these people believe this because of this.

18:57.740 --> 18:59.020
Or of course, like this happened here.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.140
It's because, you know, that happened there.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.220
So yeah, it's a lot of that.

19:02.220 --> 19:05.740
If there's like a topic that I'm doing specific research for,

19:05.740 --> 19:08.200
so like a vaccine-related stuff is a big one.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.260
The Ukrainian-Russian conflict is a big one.

19:10.260 --> 19:12.020
That I'll break out a note.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.300
I'll probably get like a Google Doc

19:13.300 --> 19:14.900
and I'll just start like writing like an outline

19:14.900 --> 19:16.580
of kind of the rough points of everything

19:16.580 --> 19:18.980
just to organize my thoughts around different topics.

19:18.980 --> 19:20.740
We're just gonna go on tangent upon attention

19:20.740 --> 19:21.580
upon attention.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.340
We'll return to the low point of your life at some point.

19:24.340 --> 19:26.460
Always returning from the philosophy to the psychology.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.460
So you did the Ukraine topic.

19:30.380 --> 19:35.380
One question is, what role does US play

19:36.260 --> 19:37.540
in this war?

19:37.540 --> 19:40.240
Could they have done something to avoid the war?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.620
Did they have a role to play

19:42.620 --> 19:45.660
in forcing Vladimir Putin's hand?

19:45.660 --> 19:49.700
Do they have a role to play in deescalating the war

19:49.700 --> 19:53.020
towards a peace agreement and the opposite?

19:53.020 --> 19:56.420
If it does escalate towards something like

19:56.420 --> 19:58.540
the use of a tactical nuclear weapon,

19:58.540 --> 19:59.500
are they to blame?

19:59.500 --> 20:01.300
Are we to blame?

20:01.300 --> 20:03.100
Oh man, somebody sent me an email a while ago

20:03.100 --> 20:04.440
with great words.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.560
There's a specific way to navigate a conversation

20:07.560 --> 20:10.840
where you can kind of like contribute to a negative event,

20:10.840 --> 20:13.640
but you're not really the one responsible for it.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.200
Like the classic example is a woman goes out late at night,

20:16.200 --> 20:18.320
gets a little bit too drunk and then something happens.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.040
And it's like, while there might've been steps

20:20.040 --> 20:22.280
she could have taken to mitigate the risk,

20:22.280 --> 20:24.040
it's not her fault of what happened

20:24.040 --> 20:27.480
because the responsibility rests on the agent

20:27.480 --> 20:28.480
making the choice, right?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.220
There's a chooser at some point

20:30.220 --> 20:32.800
that is choosing to do wrong or evil.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.200
I don't believe in any of the arguments

20:35.200 --> 20:36.960
that say the United States has contributed

20:36.960 --> 20:39.160
to Russia's position on Ukraine

20:39.160 --> 20:41.440
or the actions that they've taken on Ukraine.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.120
There are several arguments that some people,

20:45.120 --> 20:47.440
some even political scholars are putting out there

20:47.440 --> 20:48.740
to say that the United States is to blame,

20:48.740 --> 20:50.880
but I find them completely unconvincing.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.720
I think that when you ask the question of like,

20:52.720 --> 20:55.680
what is the United States role or what has our role been?

20:55.680 --> 20:57.000
I think it's really important for us.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.120
I don't think we even agree as a country

20:58.120 --> 20:59.960
on what our role should be, which I think is a hard one

20:59.960 --> 21:01.360
because you've got this kind of,

21:01.360 --> 21:04.400
there's this growing populist movement in the United States.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.960
It might be the far left and the far right.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.320
And I think populists tend to have this kind of

21:08.320 --> 21:09.920
isolationist view of the world

21:09.920 --> 21:11.920
where the United States should just be our own thing.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.920
We shouldn't be telling anybody what to do.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.160
We shouldn't be the world police.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.640
And then kind of more in these like

21:16.640 --> 21:17.960
center left, center right positions.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.280
And then across a lot of Europe, you've got, well, okay,

21:20.280 --> 21:22.880
the United States is kind of like the big kid on the block.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.040
Like we're looking to them for guidance and leadership

21:25.040 --> 21:27.760
on situations like what's going on in Ukraine.

21:27.760 --> 21:31.000
So in so far as the original question is like,

21:31.000 --> 21:32.880
what is like the United States responsibility?

21:32.880 --> 21:35.840
I think we have a responsibility to ensure the relative

21:35.840 --> 21:39.200
like freedom, prosperity and stability across Europe.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.360
I think that defending Ukraine's sovereignty

21:41.360 --> 21:43.600
and right to their borders is a part of that.

21:43.600 --> 21:47.720
And I don't believe that prior to the invasion in 2022,

21:47.720 --> 21:49.520
I don't think the United States was contributing

21:49.520 --> 21:52.400
to Russia invading that country.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.240
I know there are arguments given that like the expansion

21:54.240 --> 21:57.720
of NATO has something that's been threatening to Russia,

21:58.560 --> 21:59.400
but the Baltics joined

21:59.400 --> 22:00.640
and Russia didn't do anything about it.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.920
The invasion to Crimea was very clearly a response

22:02.920 --> 22:04.760
to the revolution in 2014.

22:04.760 --> 22:07.160
The invasion on the borders is clearly a response

22:07.160 --> 22:10.720
to Ukraine winning that civil war in the Southeast

22:10.720 --> 22:13.120
and the Donbass and Russia becoming more aggressive.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.480
I don't think that you can blame any of that

22:14.480 --> 22:15.680
on NATO expansion.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.480
There's no NATO countries that are threatening Russia

22:17.480 --> 22:18.760
or abandoning Russia.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.160
Do you think there is a nuclear threat?

22:22.200 --> 22:23.120
Do you think about this?

22:23.120 --> 22:25.040
Do you worry about this, that there is a threat

22:25.040 --> 22:27.600
of a tactical nuclear weapon being dropped?

22:28.440 --> 22:29.280
I think that possibility exists either way

22:29.280 --> 22:31.640
and I think the responsibility for that is on Russia

22:31.640 --> 22:33.640
because it just can't be the case

22:33.640 --> 22:35.600
that if you have nukes, you're allowed to invade countries

22:35.600 --> 22:36.600
and take their land.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.560
Because of anything, I think that that down the road

22:38.560 --> 22:40.760
also increases the potential

22:40.760 --> 22:43.040
for nuclear problems in the future, right?

22:43.040 --> 22:45.020
Because at that point, either every single country

22:45.020 --> 22:46.560
has to acquire their own nuclear weapons

22:46.560 --> 22:48.440
because if you don't, Russia is gonna mess with you

22:48.440 --> 22:50.520
or every single country has to join NATO

22:50.520 --> 22:52.800
and now what we're back at square zero, ground zero,

22:52.800 --> 22:53.640
square one where people are like,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.040
oh, well, look, all these countries joining NATO

22:55.040 --> 22:56.000
is aggressive towards Russia.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.720
What are you gonna do?

22:57.720 --> 23:02.120
Yeah, you've mentioned that there's a complicated calculus

23:02.120 --> 23:06.200
going on with the countries that have nuclear weapons

23:06.200 --> 23:08.440
and what's our responsibility?

23:08.440 --> 23:10.480
Are you allowed to do anything you want to countries

23:10.480 --> 23:12.200
that don't have nuclear weapons?

23:13.140 --> 23:15.360
That's a really tricky discussion.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.200
For sure.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.640
Because what is US supposed to do

23:17.640 --> 23:20.360
if Russia drops a tactical nuclear weapon?

23:20.360 --> 23:25.360
There's a set of options, none of which are good

23:25.360 --> 23:29.320
and it's such a tricky moment right now

23:29.320 --> 23:34.320
because the things that Biden and other public figures say,

23:35.160 --> 23:37.040
I feel like has a significant impact

23:37.040 --> 23:38.400
on the way this game turns out

23:38.400 --> 23:40.080
because I think mutually assured destruction

23:40.080 --> 23:43.720
is partially a game of words.

23:45.440 --> 23:48.560
I mean, I believe in the power of conversation

23:48.560 --> 23:50.560
of leaders talking to each other.

23:50.560 --> 23:55.320
I feel like you have to have a balance between threat

23:56.320 --> 24:01.320
and compromise and empathy for the needs,

24:02.120 --> 24:05.480
the geopolitical, the economic needs of a nation,

24:06.360 --> 24:11.360
but also respect and represent your own interests.

24:11.720 --> 24:12.960
So it's a tricky one.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.920
How do you play the hand?

24:15.920 --> 24:18.080
It reminds me of, I don't know if you've ever heard

24:18.080 --> 24:20.120
in evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology,

24:20.120 --> 24:22.320
there are things called tit for tat strategies.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.480
It kind of reminds me of that where it's like,

24:24.520 --> 24:25.720
there's little biological mechanisms

24:25.720 --> 24:28.160
where creatures will develop socializing tit for tat.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.480
If you do something bad to me,

24:29.480 --> 24:30.840
I'm gonna do something bad for you

24:30.840 --> 24:32.880
and then more complicated schemes will come out

24:32.880 --> 24:35.240
where it'll be tit, tit for tat

24:35.240 --> 24:36.880
or it's like, you can make one mistake

24:36.880 --> 24:38.280
and then I'm gonna get you if you do a second one

24:38.280 --> 24:39.600
or it could be tit, tit, tit for tat

24:39.600 --> 24:41.280
or there could be tit for tat, tat for tit.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.040
There's all these back and forths

24:43.040 --> 24:44.800
where creatures kind of optimize themselves

24:44.800 --> 24:47.760
and yeah, I think something the United States

24:47.760 --> 24:49.240
did really well in terms of that kind

24:49.240 --> 24:50.440
of conversational strategy

24:50.440 --> 24:52.280
and I approved of this in the beginning

24:52.800 --> 24:54.880
Biden was very clear about setting out

24:54.880 --> 24:57.600
the exact level of US involvement for the war.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.160
We're not gonna do a no-fly zone.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.120
There's not gonna be US troops on the ground in Ukraine

25:01.120 --> 25:02.680
but we are gonna send a whole bunch of money

25:02.680 --> 25:03.520
and a whole bunch of arms

25:03.520 --> 25:05.000
and a whole bunch of intel to them

25:05.000 --> 25:06.560
and I thought he did a good job at laying out

25:06.560 --> 25:08.080
the limitation of the US involvement

25:08.080 --> 25:09.720
while opening as much as we could

25:09.720 --> 25:11.200
in the ways that we could help

25:11.200 --> 25:13.200
but yeah, that looming threat

25:13.200 --> 25:15.200
of some sort of tactical nuclear weapon,

25:15.200 --> 25:16.200
I think on the table right now

25:16.200 --> 25:17.640
is it's gonna be the annihilation

25:17.640 --> 25:19.400
of Russian sea forces and everything

25:19.400 --> 25:22.760
but what happens if it continues to escalate?

25:22.760 --> 25:26.800
That's like a world that nobody wants to be in, yeah.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.080
So we talked about difficult conversations

25:29.080 --> 25:30.080
and again, thank you so much

25:30.080 --> 25:32.080
for reviewing the yay conversation.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.440
Let me ask you about Putin.

25:36.480 --> 25:37.880
Speaking of difficult conversations,

25:37.880 --> 25:39.000
so if you sit down,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.680
if I sit down with somebody like Vladimir Putin

25:41.680 --> 25:43.840
or Vladimir Zelensky,

25:43.840 --> 25:45.920
what's the right way to have that conversation?

25:45.920 --> 25:47.000
We can talk about that one

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
or we could talk about somebody more well understood

25:54.360 --> 25:56.840
through history like Stalin or Hitler,

25:56.840 --> 25:57.760
something like that.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.520
Maybe that's an easier example

25:59.520 --> 26:02.200
to illustrate how to handle

26:02.200 --> 26:04.280
extremely difficult conversations.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.040
Yeah, I mean, I can handle really difficult conversations

26:06.040 --> 26:09.480
between like two people, leaders of countries though.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.720
There's so much that you are representing

26:11.720 --> 26:13.400
in that conversation.

26:13.400 --> 26:16.200
I guess the thing that would be interesting to me

26:16.200 --> 26:19.560
would be like what is Vladimir Putin's interest?

26:19.560 --> 26:21.680
Like what is the genuine interest

26:21.680 --> 26:23.680
that he has in the conflict?

26:23.680 --> 26:25.520
Because I think finding out like what is your buy-in

26:25.520 --> 26:27.880
or what is the driving force keeping you here

26:27.880 --> 26:29.600
is probably the most important thing.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.720
I think for Zelensky,

26:30.720 --> 26:32.320
I think it's quite a bit more simpler

26:32.320 --> 26:34.160
because he's on the defense.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.760
So it's defending his country and his people.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.120
For Putin, I've heard all sorts of things.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.560
Dugan has his writings on like the East versus the West,

26:42.560 --> 26:44.280
the collapse of the West in the face of like

26:44.280 --> 26:47.320
all of the liberalism and the weird LGBT stuff

26:47.320 --> 26:48.160
that they criticize.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.040
You've got the desire to like return

26:50.040 --> 26:52.080
to this like former Soviet Union-esque thing.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.080
You've got Putin's quotes

26:53.080 --> 26:54.480
that collapse of the Soviet Union

26:54.480 --> 26:58.200
was the biggest geopolitical disaster of 20th century.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.320
And I guess figuring out like what is Putin after?

27:00.320 --> 27:01.160
I'm not actually sure.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.000
I don't know the answer to that question.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.200
I know a lot of people write about it, but yeah.

27:03.200 --> 27:04.920
Well, there's a lot of answers to that question.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.080
There's a lot of answers that he can give to that question.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.920
So say I sit down with him for three hours

27:08.920 --> 27:09.880
and talk about it.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.160
I think this is a really interesting distinction

27:15.040 --> 27:17.160
because you do do difficult conversations

27:17.160 --> 27:19.120
in the space of ideas.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.560
But also in your stream, you have,

27:20.560 --> 27:22.400
I mean, there's a bunch of drama going on.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.520
There's a human psychology is laid out

27:25.400 --> 27:27.640
in its full richness before you.

27:27.640 --> 27:32.000
So to me with leaders, I think a part of the conversation

27:32.000 --> 27:34.280
has to be about the human psychology.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.240
Sure.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.720
Not like a meta conversation,

27:36.720 --> 27:40.760
but like really understand what they feel,

27:40.760 --> 27:43.560
what they fear, who they are as a human being.

27:44.160 --> 27:49.160
As a family man, as a person proud of their country,

27:49.640 --> 27:53.400
as a person with an ego, as a person who's been affected,

27:53.400 --> 27:58.400
if not corrupted by powers, all of us can be and likely are.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.480
So all of that.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.680
That gives context to then the answers

28:02.680 --> 28:04.520
about what do you want in this war.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.840
Is that the answers about what you want in this war

28:07.840 --> 28:10.040
will be political answers.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.160
It's like a game that's being played again with words

28:13.760 --> 28:16.160
and politicians are incredibly good at playing that game.

28:16.160 --> 28:19.560
I think the deeper truth comes from understanding

28:19.560 --> 28:22.320
the human being from which those words come.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.440
And I think that's what you do.

28:24.440 --> 28:26.560
I don't know if you do those kinds of conversations where-

28:26.560 --> 28:28.480
Never talked to any country leaders, so.

28:28.480 --> 28:32.040
No, not a country leader, but say a controversial figure

28:32.040 --> 28:34.160
or somebody that represents a certain idea.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.400
Don't just talk in the space of ideas

28:36.400 --> 28:39.760
or challenge the ideas, but understand who is this person?

28:39.760 --> 28:41.840
How did you come to those ideas?

28:41.840 --> 28:43.480
Oh yeah, when I've had, there've been a couple

28:43.480 --> 28:47.320
of very controversial, right-leaning figures.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.960
So the two, obviously the mainstream is either

28:48.960 --> 28:51.160
Lauren Southern and Nick Fuentes.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.280
And those types of conversations initially

28:54.280 --> 28:55.600
aren't very political at all.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.400
Yeah, it's more like, obviously we believe in very, very,

28:58.400 --> 29:00.360
very different things, but like beliefs

29:00.360 --> 29:01.280
don't happen accidentally.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.880
So how did you get to where you are?

29:02.880 --> 29:05.200
Those are way more personal conversations, that's true.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.480
Is there things you regret about those conversations

29:08.480 --> 29:09.520
where you failed?

29:09.560 --> 29:12.240
Is there things you're proud of where you succeeded?

29:12.240 --> 29:15.520
For things that I'm proud of, I feel like I'm really good

29:15.520 --> 29:19.320
at attempting to understand people without judgment.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.720
That I think a lot of people feel like they can have

29:20.720 --> 29:22.800
conversations with me where they can share a lot

29:22.800 --> 29:24.200
and I'm not gonna jump down their throat

29:24.200 --> 29:27.480
for them having a politically incorrect observation

29:27.480 --> 29:29.640
or for them being judgmental of somebody else

29:29.640 --> 29:31.840
or having like a feeling that's maybe not something

29:31.840 --> 29:33.440
they should have, something they're embarrassed about.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.040
So I think I do a really good job at that.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.360
And then by extension of that, I've gotten the ability

29:37.360 --> 29:39.440
to hear perspectives from so many different people

29:40.320 --> 29:42.680
that I think I can understand a lot of different perspectives.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.600
For failures of mine, I mean, it's always gonna be

29:46.600 --> 29:48.920
on stream, it'll be like I didn't push back hard enough

29:48.920 --> 29:51.920
or I didn't know like a certain fact for a conversation.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.640
These are usually the, they're gonna be on these

29:53.640 --> 29:55.720
like very technical grounds generally.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.080
I'm pretty happy with like the direction

29:57.080 --> 29:59.360
my conversations have gone recently,

29:59.360 --> 30:01.000
especially over like the past six months.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
So your goal is to deradicalize the audience of those folks?

30:06.680 --> 30:08.800
So that used to be my goal.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.840
My goal was deradicalization.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.240
Now I'm kind of hoping that that's just the byproduct.

30:13.240 --> 30:15.280
So the goal I think is to talk to somebody

30:15.280 --> 30:18.440
and to show they believe this because of these reasons.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.000
And if you wanna change people's beliefs,

30:20.000 --> 30:21.680
we have to talk about the underlying reasons

30:21.680 --> 30:23.600
for why they think the things they think.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.040
It's not enough to just say like that belief is bad

30:26.040 --> 30:27.160
because it's like, well, they believe it

30:27.160 --> 30:28.320
for a whole bunch of things that are true

30:28.320 --> 30:29.800
and real to them at least.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.720
So you have to address all of the underlying things

30:32.720 --> 30:35.400
that they believe before you can change the overlying belief.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.120
So if I'm having a conversation with somebody,

30:37.120 --> 30:38.880
it'll be like, okay, why do you feel this

30:38.880 --> 30:40.160
about that, that and that?

30:40.160 --> 30:41.560
Okay, I understand that.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.840
Maybe like a better way to solve that would be like

30:43.840 --> 30:45.800
this or that instead of this thing.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.200
So to what degree do you have to empathize

30:48.200 --> 30:51.480
with the person's worldview versus pushback?

30:51.480 --> 30:53.920
That's always the hard one.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.880
When I'm talking to other people,

30:55.880 --> 30:58.240
it's almost always me stepping as much

30:58.240 --> 30:59.800
inside their bubble as I can.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.560
I have to like live and breathe their worldview

31:01.560 --> 31:03.360
and be able to speak their worldview

31:03.360 --> 31:05.440
in order to like navigate their thoughts

31:05.480 --> 31:07.760
because my worldview is,

31:07.760 --> 31:09.600
I'm not even use this as an insult.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.600
I don't know if I am a little bit autistic or something,

31:11.600 --> 31:13.240
but when I break apart things,

31:13.240 --> 31:15.440
I just wanna see like study, study, study, fact, fact, fact.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.120
That's how my mind works for everything.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.200
That's what I like to see.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.320
Like personal stories don't do much for me.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.160
Narratives don't do much for me.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.080
Just show me like the data and the studies or whatever.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.080
But for other people,

31:24.080 --> 31:26.040
I think most brains are more human than that

31:26.040 --> 31:28.680
and they tend to see things that more kind of like

31:28.680 --> 31:30.360
surreal pictures that are kind of painted

31:30.360 --> 31:32.080
and the brushstrokes are way broader

31:32.080 --> 31:35.240
and they don't care about the itty bitty tiny fact.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.360
So if I'm talking to somebody else

31:36.360 --> 31:38.200
and I'm trying to get into their head

31:38.200 --> 31:40.080
and I'm trying to change their mind on things,

31:40.080 --> 31:42.760
I'm gonna be stepping into their world

31:42.760 --> 31:45.040
and I'm gonna try to be working through that framework.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.640
Really good example might be,

31:47.560 --> 31:50.600
we'll say like when it comes to trans issues for minors,

31:50.600 --> 31:53.040
16 or 17 year old needs to get on puberty blockers.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.000
The way that I want that debate to play out

31:55.000 --> 31:57.240
is let's look at all the data,

31:57.240 --> 31:58.960
let's see what are the outcomes,

31:58.960 --> 32:00.920
let's see what are the processes for getting a medication

32:00.920 --> 32:02.040
and then we'll evaluate all of that

32:02.040 --> 32:04.880
and then we'll go in whatever like points more favorably.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.960
That's wholly unconvincing to most people, right?

32:06.960 --> 32:08.840
So as a parent, if I'm having that conversation

32:08.840 --> 32:09.760
with another parent,

32:09.760 --> 32:11.280
the easiest way for me to have that conversation

32:11.280 --> 32:13.360
is like, hey, we both have kids,

32:13.360 --> 32:14.600
imagine how horrible it would be

32:14.600 --> 32:16.320
if we felt like our kids needed help

32:16.320 --> 32:18.440
and the government was trying to get between us

32:18.440 --> 32:20.520
and their doctor in that conversation.

32:20.520 --> 32:21.720
That might be how that talk plays out,

32:21.720 --> 32:23.840
which I think that's a really good argument

32:23.840 --> 32:24.680
because I think there probably are times

32:24.680 --> 32:25.720
when the government should get in between it,

32:25.720 --> 32:26.720
but I'll have that conversation

32:26.720 --> 32:28.280
because now I'm in a world

32:28.280 --> 32:29.520
where they understand what I'm saying,

32:29.520 --> 32:32.160
I'm resonating with the way that they feel about things

32:32.160 --> 32:33.960
and then I can make progress with the way

32:33.960 --> 32:35.160
that they're kind of viewing the world

32:35.160 --> 32:37.200
because I'm talking in a language they understand.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.400
So on this particular topic of trans issues,

32:40.400 --> 32:42.720
is that the reason you were banned from Twitch?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.960
I'm not sure, I don't know.

32:44.960 --> 32:45.880
They just said hate speech,

32:45.880 --> 32:47.240
but I don't use like slurs or anything,

32:47.240 --> 32:48.760
so it's hard to know exactly.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.320
So I think you made the claim

32:50.320 --> 32:52.160
that trans women shouldn't compete

32:52.160 --> 32:54.760
with cis women in women's athletics.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.320
Can you make this case

32:58.320 --> 33:00.480
and can you still man the case against it?

33:00.480 --> 33:01.720
I think in your community,

33:01.760 --> 33:04.680
there's a lot of trans folks who love you

33:04.680 --> 33:07.040
and there's a lot who hate you.

33:07.040 --> 33:11.280
And so if you can walk the tightrope of this conversation

33:11.280 --> 33:13.200
to try to still man both sides.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.760
One of the argumentative strategies I say

33:14.760 --> 33:16.360
is that like anytime you have a conversation,

33:16.360 --> 33:17.520
you should be able to argue both sides

33:17.520 --> 33:19.320
better than anybody else.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.880
So for the my side, the genuine belief side,

33:23.960 --> 33:27.640
it feels like overwhelmingly all of the data is showing

33:27.640 --> 33:30.920
that trans, mostly trans women,

33:30.920 --> 33:34.480
even after I think three years on some sort of like HRT

33:34.480 --> 33:37.360
or estrogen stuff,

33:37.360 --> 33:39.440
they're still maintaining these advantages

33:39.440 --> 33:42.720
from their male puberty over cis gender women.

33:42.720 --> 33:43.920
And if that is the case,

33:43.920 --> 33:46.600
if we are gonna draw these distinctions around our sports

33:46.600 --> 33:48.400
between women and men,

33:48.400 --> 33:51.840
it feels unfair to have a category inside the women's sports

33:51.840 --> 33:53.640
that are maintaining advantages

33:53.640 --> 33:55.840
that are coming from a male puberty,

33:55.840 --> 33:57.480
regardless of the amount of time they've spent

33:57.480 --> 34:00.280
on hormone replacement therapy.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.360
So that would be my argument on that side.

34:02.360 --> 34:06.520
So it's unfair from a performance enhancement aspect.

34:06.520 --> 34:11.200
So the same way we ban performance enhancing drugs

34:11.200 --> 34:14.200
that involve increasing of testosterone

34:14.200 --> 34:15.800
in that same way would be unfair.

34:15.800 --> 34:16.640
Essentially, yeah.

34:16.640 --> 34:19.800
So what's the case against?

34:19.800 --> 34:21.320
The key, yeah, so the case in favor

34:21.320 --> 34:24.440
of them competing together is that realistically,

34:24.440 --> 34:28.000
there's not gonna be a trans sports category.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.440
Realistically, trans women

34:29.440 --> 34:31.120
aren't gonna be competitive with cis men

34:31.120 --> 34:33.320
because they've gone through these huge,

34:33.320 --> 34:36.680
like hormone changes by the medication they're taking.

34:36.680 --> 34:40.400
And that when we look at how sports are kind of done anyway,

34:40.400 --> 34:42.800
there's a whole bunch of biological differences

34:42.800 --> 34:44.880
between people within sports categories

34:44.880 --> 34:46.360
that are determining their placement

34:46.360 --> 34:48.120
in the professional world.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.880
So for instance,

34:49.880 --> 34:51.960
somebody like me is probably never gonna go far in the NBA

34:51.960 --> 34:53.440
because I'm not tall enough.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.800
I think the average height in the NBA-

34:54.800 --> 34:55.640
Don't doubt yourself.

34:55.640 --> 34:56.480
Don't doubt myself, yeah.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.080
I wanna say like six, six or something.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.880
They're huge people.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.600
Or, you know, you look at like Michael Phelps

35:02.600 --> 35:05.600
as a classic example of a guy whose torso is like so long,

35:05.600 --> 35:07.440
his body is built for swimming.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.080
And I think there are some trans people

35:09.080 --> 35:09.920
that will look at that

35:09.920 --> 35:11.360
or somebody advocating for this position.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.200
They'll look at that and they'll go,

35:12.200 --> 35:13.440
okay, realistically,

35:13.440 --> 35:16.400
the way that Michael Phelps' body processes lactic acid,

35:16.400 --> 35:18.280
the shape physiologically of his body

35:18.280 --> 35:20.400
is gonna put him in a level of competition

35:20.400 --> 35:22.040
that so many men are never gonna reach

35:22.040 --> 35:23.680
just because of biology.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.280
How is it fair that you can have these biological outliers

35:26.280 --> 35:27.800
competing in these categories,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.520
but then when we come to like sports categories

35:29.520 --> 35:30.680
with trans and cis women,

35:30.680 --> 35:31.720
you're gonna take trans women

35:31.720 --> 35:33.480
and say that they can't compete against cis women.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.400
Can't you also just say that they have some level

35:35.400 --> 35:37.040
of biological difference there?

35:37.040 --> 35:38.880
Like, is it really gonna be that great of a difference

35:38.880 --> 35:41.240
than what Michael Phelps has versus the average swimmer

35:41.240 --> 35:44.040
or an NBA player has versus like the average height male?

35:45.120 --> 35:46.320
Yeah.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.200
Do you think we're gonna get

35:47.200 --> 35:49.520
into some tricky ethical territory

35:49.520 --> 35:51.400
as we start to be able to,

35:51.400 --> 35:54.960
through biology and genetics, modify the human body?

35:54.960 --> 35:56.400
Absolutely.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.640
I feel like those things are coming sooner

35:58.640 --> 36:00.840
than we wanted them to.

36:00.840 --> 36:03.800
Oh, man, dude, have you seen the AI art?

36:03.800 --> 36:04.640
Yes.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.480
That's a...

36:05.480 --> 36:06.560
Of course, I'm an AI person.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.000
Oh, okay, then yeah.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
That's always been like,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.520
what's gonna happen when robots can do art

36:12.520 --> 36:13.920
better than humans, LOL?

36:13.920 --> 36:15.360
Like, well, we'll see in 20 years,

36:15.360 --> 36:16.600
in 20 years, in 20 years.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.360
And now you have AI art winning competitions.

36:19.360 --> 36:24.040
And it's funny because robots are essentially...

36:24.040 --> 36:25.360
There's a robot behind you, by the way.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.640
There's a robot behind me.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.480
Oh, nice.

36:28.680 --> 36:29.760
Robots are really good at...

36:29.760 --> 36:30.600
Careful what you say.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.320
Yeah, oh God, I'll be careful.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.520
That's not like one of the Chinese ones

36:33.520 --> 36:34.360
with a gun on it, right?

36:34.360 --> 36:35.200
Oh, okay.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.640
Hopefully not.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.000
We'll see, depending on what you say, yeah.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.320
Robots are really good at showing the limitations

36:43.320 --> 36:46.080
of the human mind in categories

36:46.080 --> 36:48.520
that we didn't believe we were limited before.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.800
I think that humans have this idea intrinsically

36:51.800 --> 36:56.800
that we have some type of innovative creative drive

36:57.280 --> 36:59.440
that is just outside of the bounds

36:59.440 --> 37:00.920
of physical understanding.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.440
And with a sophisticated enough program,

37:03.440 --> 37:05.480
we see that maybe that's not actually true.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.880
And that's a really scary thing philosophically to deal with

37:08.880 --> 37:10.320
because we feel like we're very special, right?

37:10.320 --> 37:12.640
We own the planet, we make computers.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.440
And the idea that you can start to get these robots

37:14.440 --> 37:17.240
that can do things that's like, okay, you can do math, fine.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.200
Okay, you can do calculations, fine.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.200
But you can't do art.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.760
That's the human stuff.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.960
And then when they start to do that, it's like, oh, shoot.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.440
And that terrifies you a little bit?

37:25.440 --> 37:27.960
Like losing the human species,

37:27.960 --> 37:31.040
losing control of our dominance over the Earth?

37:31.040 --> 37:32.200
I don't think it's necessarily losing control

37:32.200 --> 37:33.040
of our dominance.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.240
I mean, I guess like a Skynet thing

37:34.240 --> 37:35.760
could come in at some point.

37:35.760 --> 37:39.680
But I think it brings us to this really fundamental level

37:39.680 --> 37:41.480
of like, what does it mean to be human?

37:41.480 --> 37:43.440
What is it that we're good at?

37:43.440 --> 37:45.120
What should we be doing with technology?

37:45.120 --> 37:47.040
We never really asked that question in the Western world.

37:47.040 --> 37:50.000
It's always the technology is like normative

37:50.000 --> 37:51.920
in that technology equals good

37:51.920 --> 37:53.400
and more technology equals better.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.960
That's been like the default assumption.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.400
In fact, if you ask a lot of people,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.080
how do you know if civilization has progressed

37:58.080 --> 37:59.720
over the past 100 or 200 years?

37:59.720 --> 38:01.760
They don't say we have better relationships.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.640
We have longer marriages, we blah, blah, blah.

38:04.640 --> 38:05.720
They'll say technology has improved.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.720
We've got crazy phones, we've got crazy computers.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.440
And the idea that more technology might be bad

38:10.440 --> 38:11.840
has never even crossed somebody's mind

38:11.840 --> 38:13.960
unless it's used for like a really bad thing.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.080
Well, it's interesting.

38:15.080 --> 38:18.080
We kind of think as more and more automation is happening,

38:18.120 --> 38:20.040
we're going to get more and more meaning

38:20.040 --> 38:23.800
from things like being artists and doing creative pursuits.

38:23.800 --> 38:27.240
And here's like, oh shit, if the art,

38:27.240 --> 38:29.480
if the creative pursuits are also being automated,

38:29.480 --> 38:31.320
then what are we gonna gain meaning from?

38:31.320 --> 38:33.960
What are the activities from which we'll gain meaning?

38:33.960 --> 38:35.160
My whole life I've been working

38:35.160 --> 38:36.720
on artificial intelligence systems.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.280
There's been different revolutions.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.000
One of them is the machine learning revolution.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.240
And it's interesting to build up intuition

38:44.240 --> 38:46.840
and destroy that intuition

38:46.840 --> 38:50.560
about what is and isn't solvable by machines.

38:50.560 --> 38:54.120
I think for the longest time, I grew up thinking

38:54.120 --> 38:57.040
Go is not, the game of Go is not solvable

38:58.280 --> 39:01.200
because my understanding of AI systems

39:01.200 --> 39:06.200
is ultimately that it's fundamentally a search mechanism

39:06.440 --> 39:09.240
that is fundamentally going to be brute force.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.400
There's no shortcuts.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.600
Sure, like if it can't solve the traveling salesman problem,

39:13.600 --> 39:15.760
it's not even gonna be able to give you an approximation.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.240
So most interesting problems

39:17.240 --> 39:19.200
are giant travel salesman problem.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.640
And then, so of course it's not gonna be able to solve that.

39:21.640 --> 39:25.160
And then you, then the deep learning revolution

39:25.160 --> 39:26.480
made you realize, holy shit,

39:26.480 --> 39:29.320
these large neural networks with a giant number of knobs

39:29.320 --> 39:33.320
is able to actually somehow estimate functions

39:36.280 --> 39:38.160
that can do a pretty good job

39:38.160 --> 39:41.200
of understanding deep representation of a thing,

39:41.200 --> 39:42.960
whether that's a game of Go

39:42.960 --> 39:46.120
or whether it's the human natural language

39:46.120 --> 39:50.160
or if it's images and video or audio

39:50.160 --> 39:52.360
and even actions in different video games

39:52.360 --> 39:54.840
and actions of robotics and so on.

39:54.840 --> 39:57.280
And then you realize with diffusion models

39:57.280 --> 39:59.880
and different generative models,

39:59.880 --> 40:01.160
you start to realize, holy shit,

40:01.160 --> 40:06.160
it can actually generate not just interesting representations

40:08.800 --> 40:10.960
or interesting manifestations

40:10.960 --> 40:12.760
of the representations of forms,

40:13.600 --> 40:14.440
but it's able to do something

40:14.440 --> 40:17.000
that impresses humans in its creativity.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.680
It's beautiful in the way we think of art is beautiful.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.680
Like it surprises us and makes us chuckle

40:21.680 --> 40:25.400
and makes us sit back in awe and all those kinds of things.

40:25.400 --> 40:28.160
And yet the thing that it seems to struggle with the most

40:28.160 --> 40:30.440
is the physical world currently.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.840
So that's counterintuitive.

40:31.840 --> 40:35.280
We humans think that it's pretty trivial.

40:35.280 --> 40:38.120
The being able to pick up a cup,

40:38.120 --> 40:40.080
being able to like write with a pen,

40:40.080 --> 40:42.960
like in the physical space, we think that's trivial.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.200
We give ourselves respect for being great artists

40:45.200 --> 40:47.920
and great mathematicians and all that kind of stuff.

40:47.920 --> 40:51.160
And that seems to be much easier than the physical space.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.560
Bodies are really cool.

40:52.560 --> 40:55.480
There was a, I don't know, it's probably Asimov or somebody.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.640
There was some science fiction writer

40:56.640 --> 40:58.400
that had a short story and it was like an alien

40:58.400 --> 41:00.680
that had landed on earth and it was describing our bodies

41:00.680 --> 41:02.520
from a totally alien perspective.

41:02.520 --> 41:04.480
And when you think about all the things we can do,

41:04.480 --> 41:05.320
it's pretty cool.

41:05.320 --> 41:08.920
We can climb through a whole multitude of environments.

41:08.920 --> 41:10.920
We can exist in a multitude of temperatures.

41:10.920 --> 41:14.920
We can manipulate things just with our hands

41:14.920 --> 41:17.200
and the way that we can interact with things around us.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.480
And yeah, we're very capable on like a physical level,

41:19.480 --> 41:21.120
even though, like you said, we think about ourselves like,

41:21.120 --> 41:22.560
oh, well human beings have really big brains

41:22.560 --> 41:24.200
and we do, we're really intelligent as well.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.440
But yeah, our bodies are pretty cool too.

41:26.440 --> 41:30.680
And it's a fascinating hierarchical biological system.

41:30.680 --> 41:34.120
Like we're made up of a bunch of different

41:35.160 --> 41:38.040
like living organisms that all don't know

41:38.040 --> 41:40.920
about the big picture of our body.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.000
And it's all functioning its own little local world

41:43.000 --> 41:44.200
and it's doing its thing.

41:44.200 --> 41:49.000
But together as of, it forms a super resilient system.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
All of that comes from a very compressed encoding

41:56.280 --> 41:57.240
of what makes a human.

41:57.240 --> 41:59.160
You start with the DNA and it builds up

41:59.160 --> 42:01.720
from a single cell to a giant organism.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.680
I mean, and because of the DNA,

42:05.680 --> 42:06.840
through the evolution process,

42:06.840 --> 42:09.280
you can constantly create new humans

42:09.280 --> 42:12.120
and new living organisms that adapt to the environment.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.160
Like that resilience to the physical world,

42:15.160 --> 42:19.120
it seems like running the whole earth over again,

42:19.120 --> 42:21.280
the whole evolutionary process over again

42:22.520 --> 42:25.280
might be the only way to do it.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.880
So to create a robot that actually adapts

42:28.920 --> 42:32.080
is as resilient to the dynamic world

42:32.080 --> 42:34.400
might be a really difficult problem.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.440
Possibly.

42:35.440 --> 42:37.040
Well, I was gonna say like in a programming environment,

42:37.040 --> 42:38.680
you can do things on timescales

42:38.680 --> 42:41.080
that are impossible in the real world, right?

42:41.080 --> 42:43.400
Like the benefit to AI and computers is a computation

42:43.400 --> 42:46.000
where they can compute so much data so quickly.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.320
Whereas on human timetables, we have to wait.

42:48.320 --> 42:50.280
When you talk about evolution,

42:50.280 --> 42:53.200
it's generation after generation after generation,

42:53.200 --> 42:55.760
maybe in a virtual environment that can be simulated.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.440
And then those changes could happen a lot quicker.

42:57.440 --> 42:58.760
Well, that's not a human time scale,

42:58.760 --> 43:01.000
but you have to look at earth

43:01.000 --> 43:03.280
as a quantum mechanical system,

43:03.280 --> 43:05.240
the computation is happening super fast.

43:05.240 --> 43:08.120
This is a giant computer doing a giant simulation.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.720
So just because for us humans, it's slow,

43:10.720 --> 43:13.720
there's like trillions of organisms involved in you,

43:13.720 --> 43:15.480
destiny being you.

43:15.480 --> 43:19.480
Sure, but the next iteration of like from human to human,

43:19.480 --> 43:21.400
even if on the quantum level there's a lot of stuff going on,

43:21.400 --> 43:24.680
you talk about like changes in DNA, for instance, right?

43:24.680 --> 43:26.760
Like that's happening from a generation

43:26.760 --> 43:27.920
to generation time scale.

43:27.920 --> 43:28.880
Like in a virtual environment,

43:28.880 --> 43:30.280
that could theoretically happen.

43:30.280 --> 43:32.160
Well, it already is, there's like protein folding,

43:32.160 --> 43:35.000
like huge cloud computing, probably ML stuff

43:35.000 --> 43:36.320
that's like working on doing all of that stuff.

43:36.320 --> 43:38.400
And it'll run like trillions and trillions of simulations,

43:38.400 --> 43:39.680
you know, every second and stuff,

43:39.680 --> 43:41.040
maybe not every second, but.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.200
Still slower than the actual protein folding, much slower.

43:45.520 --> 43:49.680
That's for the problem of solving protein folding

43:49.680 --> 43:51.480
to estimate the 3D structure,

43:51.480 --> 43:53.960
but the actual body does the actual protein folding

43:53.960 --> 43:54.920
way faster.

43:54.920 --> 43:56.800
So like we're, the question is,

43:56.800 --> 44:00.840
can we shortcut the simulation of human evolution,

44:00.840 --> 44:03.040
try to figure out how to build up an organism

44:03.040 --> 44:05.360
without simulating all the details?

44:05.360 --> 44:07.960
Cause we have to simulate all the details of biology

44:07.960 --> 44:08.880
were screwed.

44:08.880 --> 44:09.720
We don't have.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.200
Oh sure, we'd have to put something in a pond

44:11.200 --> 44:12.240
and then watch it for a billion years.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.400
That might be the most efficient way to do it.

44:14.400 --> 44:17.080
That's what the universe most likely is,

44:17.080 --> 44:19.560
is a kind of simulation created by a teenager

44:19.560 --> 44:22.600
in their basement to try to see what happens.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.440
It's a computer game.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.680
That might be the most efficient way to create

44:26.680 --> 44:28.200
interesting organisms.

44:28.200 --> 44:32.160
But within the system is perhaps possible to create

44:34.080 --> 44:38.400
other robots that will be of use and will entertain us

44:38.400 --> 44:40.720
in the way that other humans entertain us.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.960
And that's a really interesting, of course, problem,

44:42.960 --> 44:46.120
but it's surprising how difficult it has been

44:47.160 --> 44:49.920
to create systems that operate in the physical world

44:49.920 --> 44:51.560
and operate in that physical world in a way

44:51.560 --> 44:55.640
that's safe to humans and interesting to humans.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.160
Cause there's also the human factor,

44:57.200 --> 44:58.520
the human robot interaction.

44:58.520 --> 45:00.680
To me, that's like the most interesting problem,

45:00.680 --> 45:02.680
to figure out how to do that well.

45:02.680 --> 45:06.280
And so Elon Musk and others,

45:06.280 --> 45:08.320
Boston Dynamics have worked on legged robots.

45:08.320 --> 45:11.120
So I really care about legged robots.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.800
Those are super interesting,

45:12.800 --> 45:17.200
how to make them such that they're able to operate

45:17.200 --> 45:18.880
successfully in a dynamic environment.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.080
It's super tricky.

45:20.080 --> 45:23.120
They're like the dumbest of dogs,

45:23.120 --> 45:25.920
speaking of which is a dog barking outside.

45:26.280 --> 45:29.080
It's really tricky to create those kinds of organisms

45:29.080 --> 45:31.640
that live in the human world.

45:31.640 --> 45:35.680
Then again, if more and more of us move

45:35.680 --> 45:39.840
into the digital world, so you stream a lot,

45:39.840 --> 45:44.840
like part of who you are exists in the digital space.

45:45.080 --> 45:48.520
The fact that you have a physical representation also,

45:48.520 --> 45:51.560
maybe more and more will become not important.

45:52.520 --> 45:53.440
I hope that's the case

45:53.440 --> 45:54.680
cause I bought a lot of stock in Metta

45:54.880 --> 45:57.080
and man, it's down a lot.

45:57.080 --> 45:59.040
Metta the company.

45:59.040 --> 46:02.400
Is there some degree, can you look at yourself

46:02.400 --> 46:05.040
like Steven, the physical meat vehicle

46:05.040 --> 46:07.840
and then the destiny, this digital space,

46:07.840 --> 46:10.600
like digital avatar.

46:10.600 --> 46:12.800
Do you sense that in a certain way,

46:12.800 --> 46:14.760
you're the digital avatar?

46:14.760 --> 46:16.800
I've always tried to keep my on-stream personality

46:16.800 --> 46:18.080
as genuine as possible.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.480
So they're one and the same to me.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.800
I don't really view them as two separate entities.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.800
But I mean, I always view myself as Steven,

46:23.800 --> 46:25.240
as a real life person.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.960
Destiny is my online name, but.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.440
No, but because so many,

46:28.440 --> 46:30.920
your social network is established in the digital space,

46:30.920 --> 46:33.480
like so many people know you through the digital space.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.640
Can there be, can we swap out another person

46:35.640 --> 46:38.720
that looks like you in like an AI system?

46:38.720 --> 46:40.840
And then that entity known as destiny

46:40.840 --> 46:42.200
will continue existing.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.440
I mean, it must be like,

46:43.440 --> 46:45.480
there must be some level of sophistication

46:45.480 --> 46:48.280
that could emulate a human brain, I would imagine, right?

46:49.320 --> 46:50.880
Probably tech's not there yet, but.

46:50.880 --> 46:52.240
Well, the question is,

46:52.240 --> 46:54.760
what's the level of sophistication of the audience

46:54.760 --> 46:57.840
that would recognize that something has changed?

46:57.840 --> 47:00.320
Like, it's the Turing test.

47:00.320 --> 47:03.520
How hard is it to trick your audience,

47:03.520 --> 47:07.440
your large audience of fans that watch your streams,

47:07.440 --> 47:11.240
that when you swap out an AI that emulates you,

47:11.240 --> 47:13.160
that nothing has changed?

47:13.160 --> 47:14.840
And the question is,

47:14.840 --> 47:16.200
do you have to really simulate

47:16.200 --> 47:18.000
so much of the human brain for that?

47:18.000 --> 47:19.160
I don't think so.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.920
Probably not.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.760
So, I mean, like you said,

47:23.760 --> 47:25.440
a lot of political discourse

47:25.440 --> 47:27.800
is just walking down the tree together.

47:27.800 --> 47:30.440
So you can probably emulate a lot of that discussion.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.640
Yeah, it would depend on if you're doing old data sets

47:32.640 --> 47:33.480
and you're training on that

47:33.480 --> 47:35.360
and I'm having conversations about abortion

47:35.360 --> 47:36.320
and you're creating vaccines,

47:36.320 --> 47:38.080
I imagine it could do it for quite a while.

47:38.080 --> 47:38.920
The only thing that would be weird

47:38.920 --> 47:40.480
is when novel issues pop up,

47:40.480 --> 47:43.400
then you probably need a more sophisticated resemblance

47:43.400 --> 47:44.240
of the inner brain, right?

47:44.240 --> 47:46.400
You have to keep training on the internet.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.520
So how the language models,

47:47.520 --> 47:49.200
and that's the most incredible breakthrough

47:49.200 --> 47:50.480
is the language models.

47:50.480 --> 47:54.280
You just have to keep retraining the system on Reddit,

47:54.280 --> 47:56.320
which is actually what a lot of it is trained on,

47:56.320 --> 47:57.440
which is hilarious.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.640
I do think it's really interesting

47:58.640 --> 48:01.200
that funny problems like the trolley problem

48:01.200 --> 48:03.800
that we can work through our normative ethical systems on

48:03.800 --> 48:05.640
are now real questions.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.600
Like if you're driving a Tesla and it's on autopilot

48:07.600 --> 48:08.440
and you're gonna hit somebody

48:08.440 --> 48:10.120
but it can swerve and hit somebody else,

48:10.120 --> 48:11.960
what ought the system do?

48:11.960 --> 48:16.000
We went very quickly from fun project in philosophy class

48:16.000 --> 48:18.600
to we need to solve this for insurance purposes

48:18.600 --> 48:19.640
as quickly as possible.

48:19.640 --> 48:21.120
That's kind of interesting to think about.

48:21.120 --> 48:22.720
Well, I actually have,

48:22.720 --> 48:25.160
I'll bring up the trolley problem with you later.

48:25.160 --> 48:28.320
There's a fascinating version of it that I find hilarious.

48:28.320 --> 48:31.000
Okay, let's return to your low point.

48:31.000 --> 48:31.840
Oh yeah.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.240
You started playing video games.

48:34.240 --> 48:35.360
That was a lucky break.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.320
You did text-based ones.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.160
That was a lucky break

48:38.160 --> 48:40.400
because you've gotten to be pretty good at learning.

48:40.400 --> 48:43.200
And then you started thinking about going to college

48:43.200 --> 48:44.880
and so on, what happened next?

48:44.880 --> 48:46.280
I mean, I went to like a prep school.

48:46.280 --> 48:47.920
So you kind of have to go to college after.

48:47.920 --> 48:48.800
That's like the point, right?

48:48.800 --> 48:50.040
I was also millennial.

48:50.040 --> 48:51.040
All of us had to go to college.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.520
That's always what they told us.

48:53.600 --> 48:57.320
My life was kind of, it's hard to describe.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.800
I didn't really think much of the future.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.360
I was just kind of enjoying the day-to-day

49:00.360 --> 49:02.360
because everything in my life was pretty weird.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.240
Both my parents had moved to Florida

49:04.240 --> 49:05.880
by the time I was 16, 17.

49:05.880 --> 49:07.840
I was living with my grandma, I was working.

49:07.840 --> 49:09.960
I had a girlfriend, moved out.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.580
We got a place, did college.

49:12.640 --> 49:13.840
By the time I got into college,

49:13.840 --> 49:16.320
I had transitioned from working at McDonald's

49:16.600 --> 49:19.240
to I was like working in a casino restaurant, basically.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.000
And I was really good at that job.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.680
So high level of patience for drunk people, insane people.

49:24.680 --> 49:26.680
And I was doing music in school

49:26.680 --> 49:28.120
because I've really grown to love music.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.360
And my kind of thought process was,

49:30.360 --> 49:33.240
my thought process was I can do music as a hobby, I guess,

49:33.240 --> 49:35.040
unless I get really good and maybe I can make money

49:35.040 --> 49:36.400
with that, but otherwise I love music.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.200
I'm okay going to school for music, getting good at it.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.560
And then just doing that on the side.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.080
And then my main job would kind of be this career

49:41.080 --> 49:42.560
I was building at the casino.

49:43.400 --> 49:47.000
And basically the trying to balance personal life

49:47.000 --> 49:49.520
plus graveyard shift, six day or weeks at a casino,

49:49.520 --> 49:52.320
and then a full-time music degree was not possible for me.

49:52.320 --> 49:54.160
And eventually I had to drop school after,

49:54.160 --> 49:55.800
I think it was like three years.

49:55.800 --> 49:59.200
And after I dropped school to maintain my casino job,

49:59.200 --> 50:02.160
after a few months, I got fired from my casino job.

50:02.160 --> 50:03.960
So I'd essentially just thrown away like the past

50:03.960 --> 50:05.840
like three or four years of my life.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.680
Why'd you get fired from the casino job?

50:07.680 --> 50:09.120
I heard there's a story behind that.

50:09.120 --> 50:10.040
Yeah, there's a story.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.360
Basically, I was just really dumb

50:11.360 --> 50:13.160
when it came to understanding corporate politics.

50:13.160 --> 50:14.680
And this is funny because the same attitude

50:14.680 --> 50:17.120
kind of followed me into the streaming world.

50:17.120 --> 50:19.160
My thought process has kind of always been

50:20.160 --> 50:21.720
that like, as long as I'm really good at what I do,

50:21.720 --> 50:22.800
I should be untouchable.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.400
If I'm really good, you can't do anything to me.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.640
I don't have to play any dumb games or whatever.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.640
And at the casino, I think I was the youngest,

50:29.640 --> 50:30.800
it was originally shift lead

50:30.800 --> 50:33.320
then supervisor position at the casino.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.920
And when I started to get my own shifts,

50:35.920 --> 50:37.400
there were problems that I would run into

50:37.400 --> 50:40.480
on graveyard shift because of carryover from the swing shift.

50:40.480 --> 50:42.680
And one of these problems was underneath the soda machine,

50:42.680 --> 50:43.800
they weren't cleaning it properly

50:43.800 --> 50:45.520
and fruit flies were showing up.

50:45.520 --> 50:48.720
And the manager came in one morning and she was like,

50:48.720 --> 50:50.680
hey, what's going on with the machine?

50:50.680 --> 50:51.760
And I told her, I was like, listen,

50:51.760 --> 50:54.480
I can't take everything from swing shift

50:54.480 --> 50:55.440
and do everything in graveyard shift.

50:55.440 --> 50:56.280
I can't do this.

50:56.280 --> 50:57.320
They need to figure out their stuff better

50:57.320 --> 50:58.280
or I need more employees.

50:58.280 --> 50:59.440
It's not possible for me.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.760
And she's like, what did you tell anybody else?

51:00.760 --> 51:02.720
Like, yeah, I complained to the supervisor

51:02.720 --> 51:04.360
on the swing shift all the time.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.840
And she told me, if you're not getting the answer

51:06.840 --> 51:08.880
that you like, then it's your responsibility

51:08.880 --> 51:11.120
to email the next person up.

51:11.120 --> 51:13.200
And I was like, oh, okay, that's interesting.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.000
And some months went on and I ran into more problems

51:16.000 --> 51:18.080
because on graveyard, here's how,

51:18.080 --> 51:19.000
I don't know if it's everywhere,

51:19.000 --> 51:20.840
but morning shift is the easiest.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.080
And that's when you're the most overstaffed

51:22.080 --> 51:23.400
because that's when all the VPs are in

51:23.400 --> 51:24.680
and that's when all the managers are there

51:24.680 --> 51:25.640
and everybody blah, blah, blah.

51:25.640 --> 51:27.480
Swing shift is the most challenging.

51:27.480 --> 51:29.640
That's where your highest flow of customers is.

51:29.640 --> 51:30.800
You're also decently staffed there,

51:30.800 --> 51:32.040
but there's a lot of stuff going on.

51:32.040 --> 51:34.560
And graveyard, nobody cares at all about you.

51:34.560 --> 51:35.920
They don't give you any employees.

51:35.920 --> 51:37.280
You might get swamped, you might not.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.120
Who cares?

51:38.120 --> 51:38.960
It's clean for day shift.

51:38.960 --> 51:39.800
That's the only thing that matters.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.520
A quick question for sort of clarification.

51:41.520 --> 51:43.720
So this is a 24 hour.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.440
24 hour dinner, yeah, in a casino, yeah.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.040
So it's a dining in a casino.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.840
Oh, by the way, I had an amazing moment

51:48.840 --> 51:50.560
at a dining in a casino recently.

51:50.560 --> 51:51.840
It's a special place.

51:51.840 --> 51:54.120
A dining in a casino is a place of magic.

51:54.120 --> 51:56.200
There's a lot of, I don't know if I'd say magic,

51:56.200 --> 51:57.840
but there's a lot of other worldly stuff going on.

51:57.840 --> 51:59.520
There's characters, there's,

51:59.520 --> 52:01.960
and I had an interaction with a waitress

52:01.960 --> 52:04.000
that was the sweetest waitress in the world.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.560
And it was just like, I don't know,

52:05.560 --> 52:09.640
made me feel less alone in this cruel world of ours.

52:09.640 --> 52:11.600
So graveyard begins when?

52:11.600 --> 52:13.920
For me, my shift was 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

52:13.920 --> 52:15.080
or sometimes I get called in early,

52:15.080 --> 52:16.760
so it'd be 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.

52:16.760 --> 52:19.640
That's no love for that shift.

52:19.640 --> 52:21.360
No, especially not trying to do school at the same time.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.120
Absolutely not.

52:23.120 --> 52:24.600
But yeah, basically, long story short,

52:24.600 --> 52:25.720
I ran into a problem with my super,

52:25.720 --> 52:28.000
where I didn't have enough employees on my shift.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.200
VPs were coming in in the morning,

52:29.200 --> 52:30.960
they're saying like, hey, the diner's kind of dirty.

52:30.960 --> 52:33.120
And I'm like, you've cut all my employees past 4 a.m.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.560
Like on some nights, I'm literally cooking

52:34.560 --> 52:36.520
and doing front of house, like all on my own.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.840
Like, I can't do this.

52:37.840 --> 52:41.360
And my manager, Pam, told me, well, you've got to figure it out.

52:41.360 --> 52:43.280
And so I remembered her advice.

52:43.280 --> 52:45.960
So I emailed the VP of Food and Beverage and I cc'd her.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.000
And I said, I'm not getting the help I need in my restaurant.

52:48.000 --> 52:48.960
Now, I didn't know at the time

52:48.960 --> 52:51.360
that I was basically completely throwing her under the bus

52:51.360 --> 52:52.760
because of that email.

52:52.760 --> 52:55.920
But retroactively, when I look back on things,

52:55.920 --> 52:58.120
or retrospectively, I see that was the moment

52:58.120 --> 53:00.160
that I got like marked for deletion.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.520
And I didn't really understand it,

53:01.520 --> 53:02.960
even though I'd heard terminology

53:02.960 --> 53:04.320
for papering somebody out the door.

53:04.320 --> 53:06.120
But after that point, I started to get written up

53:06.120 --> 53:07.840
for like a lot of little random things.

53:07.840 --> 53:10.160
Like, I'd missed one day of work

53:10.160 --> 53:11.920
in my three years at the casino.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.200
And I started to get written up

53:13.200 --> 53:15.000
for like showing up like one or two minutes late.

53:15.000 --> 53:15.840
That's kind of weird.

53:15.840 --> 53:16.880
That's whatever.

53:16.880 --> 53:19.080
Or written up for random ways about filing paperwork.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.840
And then eventually there came a situation

53:20.840 --> 53:23.280
with another employee where they were,

53:23.280 --> 53:24.760
it's complicated, it has to be like call out stuff.

53:24.760 --> 53:26.000
But basically they wanted to come,

53:26.000 --> 53:27.440
or they wanted to call out.

53:27.440 --> 53:28.560
And I told them if they called out,

53:28.560 --> 53:29.400
they were going to get fired

53:29.400 --> 53:31.520
because they were at like 10 points.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.040
They were at nine points and 10 points as a firing,

53:33.040 --> 53:33.880
blah, blah, blah.

53:34.800 --> 53:36.080
You can tell her that she's going to get a point,

53:36.080 --> 53:37.440
but you can't tell her she's going to get fired.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.400
I don't know what that meant.

53:38.400 --> 53:39.960
And then I told her that if you call out,

53:39.960 --> 53:41.000
you're going to get, you know, you're fucked.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.200
You're going to get fired.

53:42.200 --> 53:43.440
Or you're going to be at 10 points.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.680
And then I got called in early, like three days later.

53:45.680 --> 53:46.680
And Pam was like,

53:46.680 --> 53:48.520
you inappropriately communicated with an employee

53:48.520 --> 53:50.360
because you said the F word in a text message.

53:50.360 --> 53:51.240
And I'm like, really?

53:51.240 --> 53:52.240
There's no shot.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.960
And she's like, well, you also tried to fire the employee.

53:53.960 --> 53:55.920
And I was like, no, I told her she was going to get 10 points.

53:55.920 --> 53:57.040
She's like, well, you use the F word.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.520
I'm like, this is insane.

53:59.320 --> 54:01.440
Just because I was such a high performing employee,

54:01.440 --> 54:02.480
like there's no way I'm getting fired.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.320
And then I did.

54:03.320 --> 54:04.440
And I was like, yeah.

54:04.440 --> 54:07.000
Cashed out my 401k and moped for like three months

54:07.000 --> 54:09.760
because I had thrown away school for this casino job.

54:09.760 --> 54:11.640
And then I got fired from this job that like,

54:11.640 --> 54:13.240
yeah, nobody believed I got fired.

54:13.240 --> 54:14.440
It was just insane.

54:14.440 --> 54:15.280
So if you look back,

54:15.280 --> 54:17.520
if you were allowed to not just to look back

54:17.520 --> 54:18.640
to your own memory,

54:18.640 --> 54:20.000
but actually watch yourself,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.600
like somebody recorded a video that whole time.

54:22.600 --> 54:24.320
Do you think you would be surprised,

54:24.320 --> 54:26.800
you would notice some things that potentially

54:26.840 --> 54:28.600
of not having a self-awareness,

54:28.600 --> 54:30.600
not having like social,

54:30.600 --> 54:32.720
like a civility and social etiquette

54:32.720 --> 54:34.840
that's played in the human relations?

54:34.840 --> 54:35.840
Yeah, absolutely.

54:36.720 --> 54:39.320
So is that at the core of it essentially?

54:39.320 --> 54:40.160
Yeah, I think so.

54:40.160 --> 54:41.800
I mean, that follows me even to this day.

54:41.800 --> 54:43.480
There's a lot of,

54:43.480 --> 54:44.400
I don't know if you're recording or not,

54:44.400 --> 54:46.400
but when we spoke early about like meta-conversations,

54:46.400 --> 54:48.640
I have to think a lot sometimes about meta-conversations

54:48.640 --> 54:50.480
because the way that I want to drive a conversation

54:50.480 --> 54:51.960
will sometimes be way different

54:51.960 --> 54:54.480
than what is like the best way to have a conversation.

54:54.480 --> 54:56.400
Whereas I just want to like go really hard

54:57.040 --> 54:57.880
on like some itty bitty,

54:57.880 --> 55:00.360
like some idiosyncrasy, some factor figure, whatever.

55:00.360 --> 55:01.880
But that's not like the human conversation

55:01.880 --> 55:03.240
I need to have, you know?

55:03.240 --> 55:07.520
So you got fired slash left that job

55:07.520 --> 55:09.480
and that took you to the job

55:09.480 --> 55:11.240
that would be the lowest point.

55:11.240 --> 55:15.320
Yeah, because there was a huge downgrade in pay.

55:15.320 --> 55:16.600
I went from getting like,

55:16.600 --> 55:17.640
I think at the casino,

55:17.640 --> 55:18.800
because I worked so much overtime,

55:18.800 --> 55:21.080
I was getting like 22.50 an hour on all my overtime.

55:21.080 --> 55:25.040
And this was back in 2008, 2009 as like a college student,

55:25.040 --> 55:26.440
like it was amazing pay.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.200
I had benefits, like everything was good.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.880
And then the carpet cleaning was like,

55:30.880 --> 55:31.720
I was probably getting,

55:31.720 --> 55:33.640
my paycheck like every other week

55:33.640 --> 55:36.720
was maybe 1500 bucks or a thousand dollars.

55:36.720 --> 55:39.160
And I'm working like 13 day stretches.

55:39.160 --> 55:42.200
Like I have every other Sunday off and it's so many hours.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.520
Like I have to show up at the shop at like seven or six.

55:44.520 --> 55:46.640
And then I go home at like eight or nine,

55:46.640 --> 55:48.280
depending on when my jobs are throughout the day.

55:48.280 --> 55:51.320
You doing businesses or residential or what are you doing?

55:51.320 --> 55:52.160
Everything.

55:52.160 --> 55:53.000
Everything.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.200
Are you working for a company that does carpet cleaning?

55:55.200 --> 55:56.040
Yeah.

55:56.040 --> 55:57.920
Okay, so like there's a schedule thing,

55:57.920 --> 55:59.240
you have to go to it and so on.

55:59.240 --> 56:01.440
Yeah, but so like this is why the schedule would suck

56:01.440 --> 56:03.480
is sometimes I'd show up at,

56:03.480 --> 56:04.840
I think we had to be in the shop at,

56:04.840 --> 56:06.000
I think it was 7 a.m.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.480
We show up at the shop at 7 a.m.

56:07.480 --> 56:09.080
First job might be at eight or nine,

56:09.080 --> 56:10.760
but that job might be like a one hour job.

56:10.760 --> 56:11.760
So I might show up at 7 a.m.

56:11.760 --> 56:13.280
and have a job from 8.30 to 9.30.

56:13.280 --> 56:16.200
Then my next job might not be from, until like say 11.

56:16.200 --> 56:18.400
So from 8.30 to 9.30, I'll do one job.

56:18.400 --> 56:21.680
And then I've got a job from like 11 to 12 or something.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.880
Then I might have like a decent job from like five to eight.

56:24.880 --> 56:26.600
But like my whole day is destroyed

56:27.760 --> 56:30.320
and I'm doing like three smallest jobs.

56:30.320 --> 56:33.280
So I'm getting like 30 bucks maybe for being in the shop

56:33.280 --> 56:35.400
or at my job for like 10 or 11 hours.

56:35.400 --> 56:37.000
And it's just like horrible.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.600
So you're somebody that seems to be extremely good

56:39.600 --> 56:41.520
at thinking and conversation.

56:41.520 --> 56:44.880
And so have a bit of an ego perhaps

56:44.880 --> 56:48.360
in both the negative and the positive sense of that word.

56:48.360 --> 56:52.240
Was there some aspect of working at McDonald's

56:52.240 --> 56:53.960
and then working at the casino

56:53.960 --> 56:55.400
and then working for the,

56:55.400 --> 56:57.600
as a carpet cleaner that was humbling?

56:57.600 --> 56:58.840
No, never.

57:00.000 --> 57:00.840
I had a-

57:00.840 --> 57:02.640
The ego burned bright through it all.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.200
The, well-

57:04.200 --> 57:06.040
Or no, you can push back on the ego.

57:06.040 --> 57:06.960
Yeah, no, I understand.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.160
I totally get what you mean.

57:08.160 --> 57:09.840
I had a really close friend growing up

57:09.840 --> 57:11.040
whose name was Chris.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.520
And I think we probably met when he was,

57:12.520 --> 57:13.920
we were like four or five, I think.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.080
He lived behind me.

57:15.080 --> 57:16.280
And I grew up with him

57:16.280 --> 57:18.360
and I'd always been kind of an outsider

57:18.360 --> 57:20.560
to the world that I was in

57:20.560 --> 57:22.560
once I got to high school for sure

57:22.560 --> 57:25.320
because all of those kids were incredibly wealthy.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.560
Corvettes and Mustangs when they turned 16,

57:27.560 --> 57:28.680
it was a prep school.

57:28.680 --> 57:30.000
And I was doing the,

57:30.000 --> 57:31.400
they had like a work study program there

57:31.400 --> 57:33.840
where you could stay after school from 2.30 to five

57:33.840 --> 57:36.320
every day to kind of like work to pay for your tuition.

57:36.320 --> 57:39.000
So I'd been working like throughout all of high school.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.240
I got another job at McDonald's when I was 18,

57:41.240 --> 57:42.080
worked at the casino.

57:42.080 --> 57:43.600
Like I'd always been doing that kind of work.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.560
I never really viewed it as like beneath me or anything.

57:46.320 --> 57:48.400
I don't have like a family of doctors or lawyers or anything.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.160
And then me and my other friend, Chris guy,

57:50.160 --> 57:51.480
we'd always make fun of everybody else

57:51.480 --> 57:54.800
for being kind of like preppy kids and everything.

57:54.800 --> 57:59.440
So there's some pride to that sort of hard work.

57:59.440 --> 58:00.600
Yeah, I guess a little bit, yeah.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.160
Cause yeah, looking especially at my dad,

58:02.160 --> 58:03.160
like the solution to every problem

58:03.160 --> 58:05.160
was just throw more hours of work at it basically.

58:05.160 --> 58:07.280
So that was always my go-to.

58:07.280 --> 58:08.160
And I never, yeah.

58:08.160 --> 58:10.080
What was psychologically the low point?

58:10.920 --> 58:13.440
I think psychologically the low point was that

58:13.440 --> 58:15.400
as I'm doing this carpet cleaning job,

58:16.400 --> 58:20.120
driving around my city, there's like this feeling of,

58:22.000 --> 58:23.440
I guess for a lot of people it's probably college,

58:23.440 --> 58:25.800
but there's a feeling when you're in high school

58:25.800 --> 58:28.080
that everything is like so exciting

58:28.080 --> 58:30.480
and the whole world is kind of in front of you.

58:30.480 --> 58:32.960
And there are a trillion, trillion

58:32.960 --> 58:35.320
different branching paths of possibilities.

58:35.320 --> 58:37.200
And even through high school, you're thinking like,

58:37.200 --> 58:40.440
am I gonna be a doctor or a lawyer or can I join the NBA

58:40.440 --> 58:41.400
or can I do this or that?

58:41.400 --> 58:43.640
There's all these things in front of you.

58:43.640 --> 58:46.280
And I especially felt it when I was doing

58:46.280 --> 58:49.840
these carpet cleaning jobs and I think it was in the fall,

58:49.840 --> 58:51.120
I'd be outside some of these houses

58:51.120 --> 58:52.280
and I just kind of look around

58:52.280 --> 58:53.720
and I'd recognize a lot of these neighborhoods

58:53.720 --> 58:55.560
that I drive around with friends in,

58:55.560 --> 58:57.920
or I'd be walking through, I ran cross-country,

58:57.920 --> 58:59.840
some of them I'd be running through these neighborhoods.

58:59.840 --> 59:01.800
And it was just kind of like this feeling of looking around

59:01.800 --> 59:04.640
and it was like, when I was here in the past,

59:04.640 --> 59:07.120
this is like kind of like a transitionary phase of my life

59:07.120 --> 59:09.360
where I'm doing this and it's so fun and exciting,

59:09.360 --> 59:10.640
and then I'm gonna move on to something else

59:10.640 --> 59:12.280
and it's gonna be fun and exciting and awesome.

59:12.280 --> 59:16.960
And then like two years later, my whole life has collapsed.

59:16.960 --> 59:18.840
Like I'm in a house that I can't afford anymore.

59:18.840 --> 59:22.120
My ex that I hate is pregnant with my kid

59:22.120 --> 59:25.680
and I have no money, I've got no upward mobility,

59:25.680 --> 59:28.920
I failed college, my job is horrible.

59:28.920 --> 59:31.920
Like just every single, like this is like my,

59:31.920 --> 59:35.080
all of those, the wave function had collapsed into one thing

59:35.080 --> 59:36.480
and that one thing was the worst thing

59:36.480 --> 59:38.720
that it could have possibly been at the time for me.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.160
Yeah, like everything was gone and horrible.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.840
So yeah, that was the feeling I had at the time.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.760
Do you ever contemplate suicide?

59:43.760 --> 59:46.080
I thought about thinking about it,

59:46.080 --> 59:48.320
but I've just never been that kind of person, so.

59:48.320 --> 59:50.920
I mean, basically as a way to escape from the hardship.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.360
Something that I'm so incredibly lucky,

59:53.360 --> 59:54.600
I don't know why or how,

59:54.600 --> 59:56.160
I'm just gonna chalk it up to biology.

59:56.160 --> 59:59.680
I've always had really high mental baseline,

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.280
like depression and all of that.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.040
There've been a few short stints I've dealt with it,

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.960
past 30, because I did a lot of drugs.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.240
But other than that, my mental baseline is just so high.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.400
And even in the carpet cleaning days,

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.880
like if you, man, the videos might still be there.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.720
I think on my old YouTube channel,

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.960
where I'll be like playing Starcraft

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.400
when I first started getting into streaming

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.600
and I'll be calling up customers like,

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.800
this is Steve from Guaranteed Clean.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.400
We had to move your job back one hour.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.840
Is it okay if I show up instead of 2.30?

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.680
And then I hang up, I was like,

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.720
all right guys, we've got three more games.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.600
And I was like, let's go.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.440
Like stuff like that.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.120
So my baseline has always been like really high

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:28.960
for mental functioning.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.320
So even in the low point, there's that you had strength.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.560
Is there anything you can give by way of advice

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.920
from people that for home to wave function collapses?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.840
As it does for many of us.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.400
Like, holy fuck, the world is not full of opportunity

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.520
and you're kind of a failure.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.240
Like I've been there.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.080
Yeah, I don't know.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.960
It's rough because like,

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:51.600
I usually ask for compassion

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.680
from people that I have it better off.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.200
Because like once you're down there,

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.240
like the only reason I say I got lucky,

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.640
but it wasn't even really lucky.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.320
Like, or it was lucky, but it was more lucky.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.000
It wasn't just lucky that I got into streaming.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.240
It was lucky that I was into computers at an early age.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.080
It was lucky that I played video games at an early age.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.560
It was lucky that all the tech came up

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.440
at exactly that right point in time.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.080
Like I was a pretty smart guy,

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.200
but it was definitely a preparation meets opportunity.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.360
And that opportunity was like

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.400
at the exact precise moment of my life.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.640
If anything had gone differently

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.160
then I would just be cleaning carpets today, so.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.120
So in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.440
This is like one out of like.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.640
There's many, many Stevens

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.240
they're just still carpet cleaning

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.560
and they're full of pain and resentment.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.080
Yeah, the one piece of advice that I give

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.160
and I hate that I have to push back

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.120
against all these crypto bros and everybody online.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.440
For decently intelligent people that are successful.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.000
I've never heard anybody give a contradiction to this.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.480
Maybe you will, you can tell me if you disagree.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.720
I always look at kids in high school

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.560
and I'm like, just try a little bit harder.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.320
Like 30 minutes a night, if you don't study,

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.000
just do 30 minutes, just do a little bit more.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.600
It is, you are laying the foundation for the rest of your life

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.080
and you can't appreciate it in high school and college.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.200
But oh my God, when you get out,

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.080
everything in your life is so much easier.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.280
You have probably more responsibility

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.440
over the direction of your life

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.600
when you're like 13, 14 years old

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.880
than you ever will once you're like 25 and older.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.680
Because this is like when you're determining

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:16.640
the foundations that everything's gonna build on.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.480
100%, so first of all, it does seem that

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.760
the liberating aspect of being young

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.120
is like anything you learn.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.640
So working hard at learning something will pay off

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.160
in like nonlinear ways, like you said with video games.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.120
So people who are like, I hate school,

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.640
all right, well, fine, but find something

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.040
where you're challenging yourself,

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.400
you're growing, you're learning, you're learning a skill,

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.840
you're learning about a thing.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.880
Of course, you could push back and say,

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.640
well, there's some trajectories that might not be productive.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.960
If you spend the entirety of your teen years

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.800
playing, I don't know, League of Legends,

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.000
a game you have love and hate relationship with.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.120
No, just a hate and hate relationship.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.040
Okay, well, we'll talk about,

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.400
I think you have a love-hate relationship with hate

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.560
in general, we'll just talk, in love.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.480
Okay.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.640
We'll try to de-complexify that one.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.240
I think in general, just investing yourself

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.440
fully with passion really does pay off.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:20.400
But that said, also school, I feel like

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.320
doesn't get enough credit, like high school in particular,

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.800
middle school and high school,

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.900
because it's general education.

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.780
I think, especially if you're lucky to have good teachers,

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:35.740
but honestly, I haven't mostly.

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:38.180
The textbooks themselves were good teachers.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:42.260
It's a one chance in life you have to really explore

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.460
a subject, fuck grades.

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.220
Getting good grades is at tension, I would say,

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.500
with actual learning, that is true.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.540
But just get a biology textbook and to explore ideas

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:59.420
and biology and allowing yourself to be inspired

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.020
by the beauty of it.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.700
Yeah, I don't know, I think that really, really,

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:08.300
really pays off and you never get a chance to do that again.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.060
Maybe not even textbooks, like reading, straight up reading.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.940
I think if you read, this is a one time in life,

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.820
you get a chance to read, really read,

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.100
like read a book a day read.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:24.780
You can really invest, you can really grow by reading.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.540
I mean, I must, all those guys talk about it.

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.700
It's very, very rare that you meet a dumb person

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.580
who reads a lot.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.980
I don't know if that's ever happened in my life, yeah.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.380
Dumb or not successful, and the cool thing is,

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:39.100
it seems like the reading, it's like investment,

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.940
the reading you do early on in high school

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:45.140
pays off way more than the reading you do later.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:49.060
So like the really influential reading

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.380
is during those high school years,

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:55.140
because you're basically learning from others

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:59.060
the mistakes they've made, the solutions to problems.

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:02.140
You're basically learning the shortcuts to life.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.220
Like whatever the hell you wanna do,

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:07.580
music, read from the best people that the music theory,

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:10.860
like learn music theory, learn, read biographies

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.020
about jazz musicians, blues musicians,

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:16.420
see all the mistakes, see what they did, see the shortcuts.

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.420
If you wanna do podcasts and read about other podcasts,

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.180
if you wanna do streaming, read about other streamers,

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:23.900
physicists and so on, and I feel like you figure out

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.700
all the mistakes and you get to a shortcut through life.

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.420
Because most people show up to college

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.780
without having done that, and now you get a chance

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.220
to shortcut your way past them.

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.380
Yeah, 100%.

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.260
But nobody really teaches you that.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:41.940
They're like, go to school, from this time to that time,

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.060
shut up, this is just what you do, eat your broccoli.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.380
I think there's two huge problems.

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:50.140
One is, now that I'm older,

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.780
because you don't know anything as a kid,

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.300
you can't really criticize as an adult as a kid,

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.140
because you're a kid.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.780
You're ageist, if I may say so.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:56.900
I am, I am super ageist.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.980
As I get older, I get even more ageist.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.140
There are a lot of people where I argue to them like,

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:03.020
man dude, you're really 22, aren't you?

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.100
I can tell every word you say,

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.260
there's seeps of like 22 year oldness,

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.980
but that's okay, I love that for you.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.620
I could just say, because you mentioned this,

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.020
I'm your wife, as a fellow streamer, Melina,

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:16.500
you mentioned that this is a source of fights

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.940
for the two of you that, and I could just feel that.

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.580
There is truth to what you're saying,

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.780
which is like, all right, you're saying that

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.860
because you're 22, just wait until you're 25

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.580
and you won't be saying that anymore.

01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:31.500
Now, that is the most annoying thing for people to hear.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.580
Yeah, you can't ever say that, of course.

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.580
Because it's actually usually true,

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.740
because we do go through phases in life,

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.260
and you can understand that most things are phases.

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:46.540
So just in general, you can say, just wait, just wait.

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.900
You won't see this, you won't feel this way.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:50.060
Again, I could say that to you,

01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:52.140
you could say that to yourself, just wait.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.020
Whatever you're feeling like, just wait.

01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.180
In five, 10 years, you'll be a different person

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:59.460
and you will laugh at the things you take seriously now,

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:02.100
that they're causing you pain now, all that kind of stuff.

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:03.900
But people hate hearing that.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.380
Anyway, go back. Absolutely.

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.780
I think the joke that I always say is like,

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.100
if I could literally step into a time machine

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.100
and I could come back out and see myself as a 17-year-old

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.620
and I could say, hey, I am literally you from the future.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.780
You see the time machine.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.740
And I would look at me and I would see the time machine

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:20.500
and I would give myself the best advice in the world

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.900
to be the most successful person.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.140
I would ignore all of it.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.540
Even knowing it came from myself, I'd be like,

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.380
this guy sold out.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:26.740
This dude doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.900
Like, nah, I'll figure it out better.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.860
Like, he must have made some,

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.860
that's what I would think is a 17.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.020
Even if I knew it was myself from the future,

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.220
I would just 100% never believe it.

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.500
And knowing that is very frustrating.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.060
But I keep that in mind when I deal with younger people.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.220
I always stay on stream when I'm talking to,

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.500
there's been stuff with Sneak-O,

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.900
there's another girl on my stream called Lab.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.260
When I see the mistakes they're making,

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.460
oftentimes because I've made all of these mistakes,

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:49.460
sometimes in the most public and horrible fashion ever,

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:50.500
but I'm never like a mentor.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.660
I'm not gonna sit there and tell you like,

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.740
oh, do this or that or that or that.

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:54.460
Because I don't know if you're gonna listen to me

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.740
and I don't wanna condescend to you.

01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:57.100
And you figure stuff out and I'll be here

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.940
if you wanna talk about it.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.340
There was one of those stories,

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.580
there was a company that didn't work with me

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.380
because I was very adamant on defending

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.980
very radical notions about language and racial slurs

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.980
and everything when I was like 22 or whatever.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:10.980
And there was a company and they said,

01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.740
well, we don't wanna work with this guy for an event.

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.180
And after they'd said that,

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.260
I had written an article on my website called,

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:18.020
the company was Gigabyte, they make motherboards.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.340
I said, fuck Gigabyte in the ass.

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:21.020
That was the title to my article.

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:22.300
And it was like, well, if they don't wanna work with me,

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.140
I'm gonna blow them up

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.220
and never do anything ever with them again.

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.300
And it was just like, looking back at it now,

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.700
obviously as an older person,

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.660
like, hey, you need to pump the brakes and chill.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.020
You're destroying yourself.

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.300
But yeah, as a young person, it's like, yeah, you're 22.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.740
Of course you think that you can say whatever

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:36.580
and do whatever.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.660
And as long as you're good at what you're doing,

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:40.420
you've got the whole world behind you and yeah, geez.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:41.300
Well, let's go there.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:44.020
You have a history of using offensive language

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:47.220
like the R word, the N word,

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.620
including the N word with a hard R,

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:53.140
calling women bitches,

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:56.660
talking about rape in a nonchalant way.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.500
What part of that do you regret

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.300
and what part of that do you not?

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.900
Language is very complicated.

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:08.340
When it comes to stuff relating to slurs,

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:12.020
there's been like a whole trajectory of feelings

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.580
on everything related to language.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.420
So my-

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.140
For you personally and for the internet as a whole.

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:18.100
Yeah, I don't care about the internet.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.540
Almost for me personally.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:22.980
In my early 20s, I'll say like 22, 23,

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:24.700
I think probably when I first started streaming,

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.900
my feeling is that any word is just a word

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.460
and if it hurts you, that's your fault.

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:31.660
Take responsibility for yourself.

01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:32.820
This probably came from my background

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:34.140
of being like a really independent person.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.260
So that's just kind of like the mind

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.820
that I had for everything.

01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:38.700
And there were basically,

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.060
there were like a collection of experiences that I had

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.860
that as I grew, I started to realize like, okay,

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.980
well, I feel differently about some of these words

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.020
depending on the context

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.580
and I can see how they can affect other people

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.940
depending on the context.

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.780
So as I've kind of like grown,

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.060
I think I've developed a more sophisticated understanding

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.940
of how different words are used

01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:56.980
and how they affect people,

01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.060
whether they like it or not.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.700
And more importantly, whether I like it or not.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.780
And that words can, even if I don't want it to be,

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.420
they can be a vehicle for emboldening certain types

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.420
of ideas that I don't wanna embolden.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.780
And yeah, that's kind of been the whole like growth.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.140
I've been lucky that in the time

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.260
that I came up on the internet,

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.860
I was able to learn these lessons

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.460
because if I was trying to learn those same lessons today,

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.180
I would have been completely destroyed

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.140
because I had insane views on language like 10 years ago.

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.140
We could talk about the past

01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.180
or we could talk about the present.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:23.220
Let's talk about the past first.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:26.900
So how do you deal with the fact that there's videos of you

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.020
in the past saying the N word,

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.100
including the N word with a hard R?

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.260
So generally-

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.100
And what's the context?

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:34.940
Can you give me like,

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.620
can you remember what would be the context usually?

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.580
When I lay out this defense,

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:42.100
it's not because I wouldn't have used the N word.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.380
Generally, whenever I said the N word,

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:44.820
it was usually in an example of like,

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.180
this is something that like a racist person would say.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.260
I don't think I've ever, on the internet,

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.460
I don't think I've ever called anybody

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:52.380
like the N word with a hard R.

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.380
Not because I wouldn't have,

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.220
but just because it wasn't in my vocabulary.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.900
I played RTS, real time strategy,

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.540
and we use the F slur for gay people.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:02.020
That's the one, and I use that one a ton.

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.460
I've called people that a ton in the past.

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.820
So I should actually, just as a small tangent.

01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:07.660
Yeah, go for it.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:10.380
And this is what I'd like to explore with you.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.500
There's a ruthlessness to the language in the gaming world.

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:18.780
And there's different communities.

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:23.220
They have different flavors of language,

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.180
of hate speech, essentially.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:27.900
And there's also a humor to it,

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:33.420
which really bothers me in a dark way

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.260
that I haven't been able to really think through.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:41.500
Because humor seems to be a kind of catalyst for hate.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.100
It seems to normalize hate.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:48.060
Like you say, basically, it's like Louis C.K.

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.100
says a lot of edgy things.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.500
But you take something Louis C.K. says

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.900
and do it in a non-funny way,

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.100
and do it over and over and over,

01:11:55.140 --> 01:12:00.140
and keep increasing the hatefulness of it, the vitriol.

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:04.380
And somehow you find yourself like Alice in Wonderland

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.580
in a world full of hate, where there's no good and evil.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:08.580
It's all the same.

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.500
In fact, the good is to be mocked,

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:14.820
and the evil is to be celebrated for the humor of it.

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.540
Basically not taking the ideas of evil seriously.

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.700
And I don't know what it,

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.420
it reveals something about human nature

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.860
that you can let go.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.860
The moral relativism that can happen

01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.060
when you do that kind of stuff.

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:32.060
At the same time, I'm a fan of dark humor when done well.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.420
Anyway, for people who are not familiar,

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.420
I just wanted to mention that some of the worst hate speech

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:44.140
that ends in LOL happens in gaming communities.

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:47.340
And that's where you come from in a certain part.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.020
So a lot of people don't remember this

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.140
or don't know this because they're younger,

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:54.060
but way back in the day in the late 90s,

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.860
early, mid 2000s of the internet,

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:59.100
the way that online kind of like shit talk worked was

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.380
you were just trying to ramp up

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:04.340
to the most insanely edgy, crazy stuff you could say

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.580
to like provoke a reaction.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:09.340
Have you ever heard of something called the aristocrats?

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:11.140
That it's like a joke, the joke?

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:13.260
Oh yeah, the joke, yeah, there's a movie on it, yeah.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:16.100
Okay, basically every single like shit talk

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.460
back and forth on the internet was like that.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.780
Like what is the most increasingly depraved,

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:22.420
and back then you didn't get banned for slurs or anything

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:23.340
on any of these chat rooms.

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.860
So it was just like an insane world to walk into.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:29.620
And I was fully 100% a part of, a product of,

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.260
and a contributor to that world.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:34.020
So that probably still goes on on the internet in some way,

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.180
and that probably still goes on the internet

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:39.260
in a maybe more pacified way.

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.820
Only in darker parts of the internet.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.780
I'd say for the most part, most, well,

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.540
compared to back then, compared to 20 years ago,

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:46.140
the internet is way cleaned up now.

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.740
There are still gonna be boards you can go on

01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.820
or parts of the internet where you see that type of humor,

01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.660
but nowhere near as mainstream.

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.420
Like back then you could open your mic on Xbox Live

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.700
and hear some insane stuff when that first started.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.700
Nowhere near what you'd hear today, although it's, yeah.

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.260
There's still elements of escalation that happen

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:04.860
that just seems to be part of human nature on the internet.

01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.060
Because we don't get the feedback

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:08.220
of actually hurting people directly.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:13.220
So the trolling, like for the lulz, you'll do like,

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.540
you will still escalate within the bounds.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.220
You're just saying that there's more bounds now.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.420
On Reddit, there's more bounds and so on.

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.860
So there's moderators that kinda yell at you,

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:26.580
that ban you and so on if you cross those bounds.

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.940
But overall, that basic human instinct to escalate,

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:34.100
especially under the veil of anonymity is still there.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:35.500
I don't know, it's dark, it's dark.

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.620
Yeah, there's a lot of different ways to look at it,

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.060
and there's different ways you can break that art.

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:41.060
Like for instance, you mentioned dark humor,

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:44.940
and you say that sometimes dark humor is funny,

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.340
and sometimes it's not.

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.100
I think that it's really important to dig into

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.380
and figure out why certain things are funny.

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:51.300
Can I give you an example?

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:52.140
Yeah, go.

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:52.980
It's from your subreddit.

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:53.900
Oh boy.

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.700
No, that made me laugh and I felt wrong about it.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.260
Oh no.

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.660
So this is a...

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:02.420
I already know what this is, yeah.

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:03.460
Yeah.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:04.660
So this is a trolley problem.

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:07.780
To me, it connects because I think about the,

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:10.060
it keeps, because I worked on autonomous vehicles,

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.860
the trolley problem, the philosophical thought experiment

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:14.580
keeps brought up a lot.

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:16.780
When AI is part of making the decision,

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.980
do I kill three people here or five people here,

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.740
and AI makes that decision, how do you do that calculus?

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:27.300
And this particular, there's a deep,

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:31.180
so it's satire that reveals some kind of flaw in society.

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.380
I feel like that's why-

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.580
That's what dark humor does?

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:35.180
Successful dark humor does.

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:36.020
And I don't know if this-

01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:36.980
It's a flaw.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.820
I feel like there's a certain brand of dark humor,

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.340
and I think the reason,

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:43.740
I think the reason is why it's good,

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.380
or why it is good humor.

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.220
I think it's because it,

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.260
I don't think it necessarily reveals a flaw.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:50.340
Sometimes I feel like it reveals a kind of virtue, I think.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.540
If you look at this particular thing-

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:53.380
Can I explain what we're-

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:54.220
Yeah, go for it.

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.060
Oh yeah, sure.

01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:55.900
We're just listening.

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.420
The title of the Reddit post is You Know What to Pick,

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:03.420
and it says, five people are going to die either way,

01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.300
but if you flip the lever,

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.940
the trolley will do a sick fucking loop first.

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:13.980
And also the top comment is a question saying,

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.540
which I think is also part of the dark humor

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:17.380
that's successful.

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.220
Oh man.

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.140
Can I get the gender and ethnic backgrounds

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:21.580
of the groups first?

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.820
And the top answer is both groups are each comprised

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:29.820
of five white orphaned cis male heavy meth users

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.460
who are consistently in and out of drug rehab,

01:16:34.460 --> 01:16:37.060
all who identify as right-wing extremists.

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.060
Humor is such a sophisticated thing that we engage in.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.340
Humor is really complicated.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:45.060
But I would argue that hopefully the humor here

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.620
shows the virtue of this is obviously horrible,

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:49.980
but that's kind of why it's funny.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.580
It's funny because it's such a horrible question to ask.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.140
Do we kill five people in a boring way

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.300
or in a really entertaining way?

01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:57.140
And it's like, that's really, that's really-

01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.300
And then when you ask even more,

01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.460
what are the ethnic backgrounds?

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.500
That's even worse to say that.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.220
So I feel like that's the type of,

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.860
there's a way that you can engage with dark humor

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.340
where it's like, oof.

01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:08.780
It's funny because it's so wrong and so taboo.

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:10.220
And we all know that it's wrong and taboo

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:11.940
and that's kind of where the shared laugh comes from.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:16.580
So for me, the question that asking the diversity question

01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:19.340
is a sophisticated way of revealing the absurdity

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:20.660
of asking about diversity

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:22.500
when it's talking about human life.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.140
Oh, interesting, because the way that I took that was,

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.980
I think it reveals the absurdity of how people

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.220
will weigh different ethnic backgrounds so differently

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.900
when it comes to value of human life.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:34.060
Like I'm actually thinking of that in terms of like

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:35.740
an immigration related question

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.300
where people are really keen and quick to dehumanize

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.980
like black or brown people.

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:40.820
So like the question is like,

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.460
well, if five of them are brown and five are white,

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:44.740
well, I know which one I'm gonna pull the lever for.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.580
That's how I read that.

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:46.740
But it's satirizing that aspect.

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:47.900
Yeah, exactly, yes, of course, yeah.

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:50.060
But that's what I mean, that that's the flaw.

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:55.060
To me at least, it showed that humanity

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.060
or social networks that are easy to be outraged

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.820
and love the outrage and the chaos

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:05.100
that Twitter and social networks

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.180
will pull that lever.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:10.420
Like they would always try to maximize the fun.

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:14.620
And there's a sick aspect to all the atrocities,

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:16.780
all the tragedies that happen in the world

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.780
that we kind of always lean towards

01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:23.220
the outrageous narrative weaved around it.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.380
Yeah, the one that leads to sort of the most clicks

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:32.140
to the most attention, to the most outrage,

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:33.700
to all that kind of stuff.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:37.780
So that's almost like a satire of society

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:42.620
when they are faced with tragedy, they will maximize.

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:46.180
I'm trying to think of a word that's not fun, but.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.100
Entertainment.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.140
Maximize the entertainment, yeah.

01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:50.460
This is a big criticism I give,

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:52.500
especially to conservative crowds.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:54.700
Left-leaning people, everybody doesn't.

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:56.420
I don't like when people blame the media

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:58.060
for the state of the media today.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.340
I very much believe that everything in society

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.460
is a feedback loop.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:02.740
And that if you're really unhappy

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:03.580
with the state of the media,

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.020
I think that the media is a good reflection

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.180
for what people want to see.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.340
Because there is a room right now in the United States

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.460
where somebody could start a company

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:12.420
where all they do is completely factual reporting.

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:13.700
They don't have a political slant.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:14.540
And they're not giving you

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.260
these like sensationalist narratives or stories.

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.060
And that media company would fail in two weeks

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.100
because people don't want to see that.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.860
Generally, people really want to see the like,

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:22.820
show me the guy that really believes in what I say,

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.020
that calls the other guy an idiot,

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.780
the guy that are screaming on TV or on the radio,

01:19:25.780 --> 01:19:27.620
like, this is what I really want.

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:28.980
And people will engage in that.

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:32.100
And that feedback loop will continue for generations.

01:19:32.260 --> 01:19:33.100
And then all of a sudden people are like,

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:34.580
why is the media so biased?

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.340
Why is the media driving so many narratives?

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:37.180
And I was like, well, what do you mean?

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.060
This is exactly what you want to see.

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.780
And that's frustrating for me.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.100
That's one of my big kind of when I defend establishments

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:45.780
or when I talk about like the interplay between citizen

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.660
and all these institutions we have,

01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:51.180
that the institutions are very much a reflection

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.340
of the population, at least in democratic societies.

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:56.300
And I think that people very much try to elude

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.700
the personal responsibility or the country's responsibility

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.940
to why some of them look the way that they do.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.900
But that takes us back to the N word with a hard R.

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:06.740
Sure.

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:07.700
Why?

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.660
For the particular examples that I was giving,

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.900
for the particular conversations that I was having,

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:13.740
if you're going to have challenging conversations

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:14.900
around certain words,

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:16.540
I think you should probably be able to say them.

01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:18.580
Otherwise it feels really ridiculous to me.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:19.420
That's like my-

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:20.740
Do you still believe that?

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.020
For, yes.

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.780
And not like calling people those words,

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.620
but in having conversations about those words,

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.100
I would say that I still believe that, yeah.

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.060
But don't you think, as you said,

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.620
that using those words

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:35.500
actually gives motivation and strength

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:38.140
to people who have hate in their hearts?

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:41.860
I think depending on the context of what's going on,

01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:43.460
I think that that's gonna be a big driver

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:46.340
in terms of how people are going to perceive or take it.

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.540
So in a conversation about the N word,

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:49.940
I don't think I would normally say the N word,

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.700
we would just talk about the word

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:53.940
much the same way that like in a movie,

01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:55.900
like in Django, people use the N word.

01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.500
Should that be censored in that movie?

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.860
Or in the context of that movie,

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.020
is it being employed in a way

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:01.140
where these aren't good people,

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.060
you're not supposed to like them,

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.340
and that's what the audience walks away with?

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:06.420
Yeah, but that context is different than conversation.

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:08.740
It feels like in conversation,

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.940
you using that word normalizes it.

01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:14.260
And that normalizing that word

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.820
is going to make it easier for people

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.420
who use that word in a hateful way to use it.

01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:23.500
Same with the F word, the F slur.

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.660
If you use that casually and normalize it

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.740
in a way that's not hateful,

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.820
you use it in a way that's not hateful,

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.620
but the side effect is that it normalizes it,

01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:38.460
then people who do use it in a hateful way

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.300
will be more likely to use it.

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:43.700
Therefore, mathematically looking at the equation

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.940
of the number of times the N word or the F word

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:48.620
is used throughout the world,

01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:51.380
it increases the number of times it's used in a hateful way.

01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.540
Yeah, I think that human beings-

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.500
And you're part of that problem, Stephen.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:55.820
I don't agree.

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.020
I understand the thought process,

01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.780
but I don't know if using certain words

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.580
within different contexts

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.780
is going to necessarily normalize

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:06.220
the hateful use of that word.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.740
That is an argument that I've heard people use.

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.180
Somebody will say, okay, well, hold on.

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:12.540
That should never be used ever,

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.820
because by virtue of you normalizing it,

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.780
even in an inoffensive environment,

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:18.740
you increase the proclivity for people to use it

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.660
in a potentially more offensive environment.

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:21.940
And my argument is always like,

01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:23.500
no, I don't think that crossover exists.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.100
But if you did want to take that argument,

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:26.460
and maybe you do feel this way,

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:27.820
I think that you get really problematic

01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:30.020
when you run into communities that do use certain words

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.900
that people would say, well, they should be allowed to do it.

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.500
So for instance, if you think that any utterance

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.260
of the N word at all is highly problematic

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.580
and might increase hatred,

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:38.820
then the entire rap industry has to dramatically change

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.340
the way that they engage with the N word.

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.220
And obviously a lot of people

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:43.140
that criticize people's use of the N word

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.420
aren't going to turn to rappers and say,

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.900
well, you guys can't say it either.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:48.660
No, it's who uses the N word.

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:51.020
So it's not just the word,

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:55.780
it is context dependent.

01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:00.460
But I would say that you, as a white person,

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:04.700
having conversations, the context there

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:07.340
is the kind that would lead to an increase in hate.

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.500
Do you think the N word should be censored in the dictionary?

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.580
No, and I believe there's a Wikipedia page on it

01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.740
and it's not censored.

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:16.340
Yeah, I think it should be in the dictionary.

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:20.140
I think the context of casual conversation,

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.100
like I said, I just believe that on the internet,

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.980
having humor, having fun conversations

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:30.420
as you have on your streams,

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.260
that leads to the normalization of the word

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.220
without any educational value,

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.060
without significant educational value.

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:37.900
I think I would agree with that.

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:39.620
No, sorry, so there's a difference

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:41.780
between F slur and N word,

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:46.140
and both I think should not be used in a fun way,

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.220
but the F word was used in a fun way for a long time.

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.060
For sure.

01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:52.380
And I'll tell you something that bothers me

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.580
about your streams,

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:58.460
not your streams and basically every other stream,

01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:00.940
is the casual use of the R word.

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.580
Oh, the ableism, yeah.

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.140
I don't know if it's about the able,

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.300
I don't even know, listen, it's complicated.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:08.900
I'm not like virtue signaling here.

01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:10.500
No, ableism isn't a virtue signal.

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.340
I mean, it's a legitimate, yeah.

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.980
Like I get emails from fans that say like,

01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:16.740
hey, I deal with this particular issue.

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.940
Every time you use this word,

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.780
it kind of feels like you're attacking me.

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.980
So it's a valid concept, yeah.

01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:24.180
It's just something cuts wrong for me.

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:26.660
Like for example, I'm not bothered by,

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:30.220
I am bothered by the excessive use of the word fuck,

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:35.220
but not moderate use of the word fuck.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:36.180
What is it I'm curious in,

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.420
when somebody calls somebody an R word,

01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:40.180
what is the feeling that you get

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:42.460
that makes you feel bad about it?

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.460
It signals to me that you don't give a damn about

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.060
people who are struggling

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.100
in ways that you are not struggling.

01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:58.460
Like that signals to me,

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:02.140
like about the experience of others.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.060
Do you think that there are other words also

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.500
that could convey like a similar feeling to you or what?

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.340
Because it feels like you've drawn

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:09.380
a pretty special circle around,

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:10.260
because like I imagine,

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.300
oh, this guy's, you're an uneducated dumb fuck

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:13.980
or you're a nitwicker,

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.060
like those words probably don't feel it.

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.900
That circle keeps changing.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.340
Which it can, which is fine, it doesn't.

01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.300
I think that's the whole point with the culture.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:25.260
So I'm trying to feel, my feeling is a kind of,

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.540
I'm a human being that exists in a social context

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.300
that we're all evolving that language together

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.140
and just feels wrong.

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:34.180
Like the word bitch, for example,

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:37.540
it really, like I've heard on your streams and in general,

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:42.540
calling a woman a stupid bitch really bothers me.

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.180
But it's not just the word bitch, it's context.

01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:47.420
Like for example, me personally,

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.820
I'm speaking to me personally,

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:53.500
like badass bitch is different than stupid bitch.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.300
Sure, like a bad bitch or something is different.

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:56.140
Yeah, of course.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:56.960
Way different.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.740
I think it speaks to a bigger sense of civility

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:05.260
and respect for human beings that are not like you.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.340
That's what, that's the feeling that I'm bothering.

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:10.500
So I guess what I'm trying to say here is

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:16.820
just because people speak in this kind of way

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:19.700
in the gaming world and streams

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:23.740
doesn't mean that you, like a lot of people look up to you.

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:26.940
It doesn't mean young people especially,

01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.860
doesn't mean that you don't have the responsibility

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:31.100
to sort of stand alone from the crowd

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.660
because you're somebody that values

01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:35.180
the power of effective discourse.

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:40.260
And to be effective discourse,

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:41.860
there's some level of civility.

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:44.540
So you can be the sort of the beacon of civility

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:49.540
in that world versus giving into the derogatory words.

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:55.140
Because like you have to lift people out of that world,

01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:00.140
out of the muck of what I would say is like drama

01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:01.660
and ineffective discourse.

01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:04.220
It's like, I think that's one of your missions, right?

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.540
Is like to inspire the world through conversation,

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.020
through debate, through effective discourse.

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:12.500
So I guess I'm just calling you out that I think

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.660
using our word, for me personally,

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.660
as a fan that believes in your mission,

01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:22.140
it just makes you look ineffective and bad

01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:24.980
and uninspiring to young people that look up to you.

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.500
Because those young people are going to use those words

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:30.980
that you're using and they'll do it much less effectively.

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:32.340
That's the problem.

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.700
I guess the challenge is always just like finding the line.

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:38.140
Like my vocabulary shifted dramatically from,

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.700
even from like two or three years ago,

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.740
I think my vocabulary shifted quite a bit

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:43.740
as we've like, we've kind of gotten rid of some words

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.260
and some things are kind of coming out.

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.380
The R word is one that has kind of gone out and come back

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:49.740
and gone out and come back.

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.380
That one we've definitely gone back and forth on.

01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.620
I know there are different thoughts about it

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:54.180
in different communities on the internet.

01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:56.380
This isn't, I mean, I'm just telling you,

01:27:56.380 --> 01:28:01.380
for me, it cuts, and I'm not a social justice warrior type,

01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.740
it cuts pretty hard.

01:28:03.740 --> 01:28:05.420
Like what you're saying is I'm going to lose a subscriber

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:06.420
if I'm-

01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.100
No, it's not a subscriber.

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:11.100
I just, I actually have to empathize harder

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.140
because I'm like, maybe this is not a very good person.

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:15.300
That's what I feel.

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:18.260
Like if you're so carelessly using that word,

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:20.100
then maybe you're not actually thinking deeply

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.620
about the suffering in the world.

01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:24.780
Like to be a student of human nature,

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.420
you really have to think about other humans

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.340
and other experiences that are unlike your own.

01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:29.180
Yeah, of course.

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:30.020
And so that's the sense I get.

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:34.220
But at the same time, you're also like the grandpa,

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.900
I mean, ages, who's trying to be cool with the young kids.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:40.220
A lot of the reason young kids look up to you

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:42.940
is like you also know the language of the internet.

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:43.940
Yeah, but I mean, it doesn't,

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.700
that's not an excuse to use words

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:46.740
that we think shouldn't be used.

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:48.380
I guess the question that I would have,

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:49.300
because it's always a struggle,

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.020
and to some extent it's kind of happened,

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.780
is let's say that like three years ago,

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:55.900
I would have said I'm no longer saying the R word.

01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.220
That's just, I'm just going to get rid of that

01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:58.380
in my vocabulary.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:00.300
Like, is there a chance that today

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.860
we would be having a conversation about like,

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:04.100
why do you call people dumb fucks?

01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:05.180
Like, is that really appropriate?

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.660
Like, does this attack at the core of like somebody's like

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:10.300
level of intelligence, education, opportunities in life?

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.700
Like, is that a worthy, you don't think so?

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:15.540
I think that's a, as the kids say, cope.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:16.380
You really think so?

01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:17.220
I think that's a cope.

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:18.900
Because the words have definitely moved in a way

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.740
where it's like, this was okay, now it's not,

01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:21.580
this is okay, now it's not.

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:23.140
So you're standing your ground by using,

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:26.580
listen, you could, you could, you could.

01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.460
But I think it's better to use those words

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:33.700
if you want to defend the ground words stand on,

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.340
to use them rarely and deliberately

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:38.780
versus how you currently use them,

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:42.180
which is to express an emotion.

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.580
Like, you, I'm going to be honest,

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.620
you use R word, not when you're at your best.

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:49.180
True.

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:50.420
And so that's not-

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:51.420
That's generally, that can be true

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.380
for a lot of swearing too, that.

01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:53.220
But yeah, I know.

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:55.940
No, but like, you know that R word is offensive.

01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:59.380
And there's, part of it is like the,

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:02.660
you tell yourself that like,

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.380
you're still kind of fighting political correctness

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.580
by using it a little bit when you say it.

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:08.420
No, I don't think so.

01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:10.580
I think, I'm trying to think in terms of like,

01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:11.620
where is the virtue where,

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:12.860
like there's a whole bunch of arguments

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:14.700
for why some words are okay, some words aren't okay,

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:15.540
or whatever.

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.980
And I try to like think more along those lines rather than,

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.460
but like, there's going to be like a lot of phrases

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.420
where like, if the R word has come out,

01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:23.620
the conversation is over.

01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:25.580
Like, I know that, like things, my brain is shut down,

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:26.740
the person I'm talking to is.

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:28.340
But there's like, there's a lot of words also

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.460
in terms of like, it like, if you ever hear me say

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.860
like fucking moron in a debate, it's like it's done.

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:33.980
Like this conversation is over.

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.620
There's no way that anything productive

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:37.020
is happening past that point.

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.060
I think fucking moron is not,

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:40.940
I think it's ineffective, it's not civil,

01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:44.300
but it's not, it doesn't bother me in a way.

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:47.740
It's basically when you speak in a way

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:51.340
that I know there's a group that's going to be hurt by that.

01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:54.020
Not only do I think about the hurt that group experiences,

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:57.820
I think of you as a lesser intellectual.

01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.580
Like as a lesser person who's thinking about the world.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:05.580
What bothers me the most is just what kind of mindset

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:07.740
that inspires in young people.

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:09.740
So especially when you're in a public figure

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:11.460
and a lot of people look up to you.

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:15.180
So I definitely don't think sort of this idea,

01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.500
the R word is not the battleground

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:22.180
of expanding the Orton window of discourse.

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:27.180
Okay, like I don't think it'll lead to dumb fuck

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:31.420
being canceled two years later.

01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:35.500
Unless that word is hurting people's experience,

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.900
which I don't foresee that happening.

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:42.020
I think legitimately R word and F slur

01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:47.020
and calling women bitches, context matters here too.

01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:50.820
Like of course, but just the way I've heard you use it,

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:54.300
it's from emotion and it's from frustration

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:57.300
and it ultimately is rooted in disrespect.

01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.420
Like I think it's ineffective.

01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:02.900
And of course, like who gets to say, I don't know.

01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:05.260
But I'm saying somebody who would,

01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:09.100
like I admire effective conversations

01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:13.140
and I admire great humor, dark humor, wit.

01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:18.180
To me, oftentimes the use of the R word

01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.220
in the way you've used in the way I see the community

01:32:20.220 --> 01:32:22.180
use it is none of those things.

01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:24.940
It contributes not at all to the humor and so on.

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.660
Now I could see it might contribute

01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:30.740
to the camaraderie of that particular group,

01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:34.060
especially when they normalize the use of that word.

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.220
You kind of take some of the edge off,

01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:40.980
but you forget that there's a large number of other people

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:43.460
that don't have the chemistry,

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:46.740
that don't hear the music of the friendship that you have,

01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:47.940
the relationship you have.

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:51.340
And instead they hear the normalization of a hateful word

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:53.900
and it ultimately has an impact that's hateful.

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.020
And then people like me who show up,

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.180
I haven't watched much of your stuff.

01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:01.420
It turns me off from like a couple of times

01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:04.340
your content came before me

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:05.460
and I listened to it a little bit,

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.380
it turned me off completely.

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:09.380
I didn't understand how good your heart is.

01:33:09.380 --> 01:33:12.140
I didn't understand how your mission

01:33:12.140 --> 01:33:16.340
of actually de-radicalize people, help people,

01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:21.420
and increase the level of good faith discourse in the world.

01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.700
I didn't understand any of that

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:25.020
because what I was hearing is pretty rough,

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:27.060
like the R-word type of stuff.

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:29.460
And I just feel like the benefit cost analysis

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:31.020
is heavy on the cost.

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:31.860
Gotcha.

01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:34.060
So I just have to sort of call this out.

01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:37.780
And I straight up think it's wrong,

01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:39.700
but that's my opinion.

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.340
Why do you think it's wrong?

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.540
Because it's hurting people

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:45.220
without any benefit to you whatsoever.

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.060
When you say hurting people,

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.100
do you mean the person I'm using it at?

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:47.940
Or do you think there's like the-

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:48.780
No, no, no, no.

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:49.620
The affected third group.

01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:51.220
The third group.

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:52.100
It's good feedback, right?

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:53.260
I always consider everything,

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.180
especially, I respect you a lot.

01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:55.580
You're a really smart guy.

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.220
Something that I always kind of like

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:01.500
fight over in terms of like language

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.780
or like who to attack or what to attack or what to do

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:06.220
is that it's very hard to draw

01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:11.100
like what boxes are okay to insult people on versus what aren't.

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:13.780
So for instance, if I call somebody like a Nazi

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.220
with a lot of vitriol,

01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.140
I'm okay with every single Nazi

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:19.980
being negatively affected by that

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:23.900
because that category intrinsically calls upon

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.060
at some level of moral condemnation for me, right?

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.620
Whereas like if I'm out there,

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.500
I try not to do like image related jokes, right?

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:30.320
I don't wanna call you like,

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.580
oh, you're a fat fucking loser

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:32.420
because there's a lot of people

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:33.860
that are fat that are overweight

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:34.820
where I don't want them to feel bad.

01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.380
I don't want them, I'm not trying to call you out

01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:37.620
or like insult you.

01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:40.420
So there's like a lot of, you say cost benefit.

01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:42.740
I like a lot of collateral damage from a word like that

01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:45.220
where there's no purpose in doing that.

01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:46.940
So certain words are easy to get rid of.

01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:48.140
They're off the table, right?

01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:51.180
Epsler, N-word, like these are not words you call people

01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:53.900
because there's so much collateral, it's not worth it.

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:56.240
We've got some words where it's like,

01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:58.380
if you have some form of like mental thing,

01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:00.220
it is a bad thing, you're not a bad person

01:35:00.220 --> 01:35:01.660
but just using that word could feel

01:35:01.660 --> 01:35:04.500
like a collateral damage to those people.

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.900
And then there's other categories of words.

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.940
So like, if I say that like this person is like,

01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:11.380
it's a stupid fucking Republican, right?

01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:14.380
There's probably some Republicans that aren't dumb

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:16.140
that I don't want to feel called out by that.

01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:17.980
Like are those types of phrases that you think

01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:19.260
should be completely removed as well

01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:20.300
or I'm kind of curious now.

01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:24.820
So this completely removed just so we're clear.

01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.660
I'm not referring to censorship.

01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:27.500
Oh no, I'm not even talking about,

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.380
I'm just a person like emotionally like.

01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.700
Removed is the wrong word though.

01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:34.060
Like I care about like,

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.260
I'm not trying to listen to people on the internet saying

01:35:36.260 --> 01:35:38.340
like you shouldn't say that word, that's not good.

01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:43.260
I mean, I'm trying to look to your mind and heart.

01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:45.180
And the reason we're talking today

01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:48.300
is you're betraying your gift.

01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.900
You're better than this.

01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:50.820
You think it's indicative

01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.500
of like a more flippant thought process

01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:54.100
where it's like the only way you can say that word

01:35:54.100 --> 01:35:56.700
is if you're ignoring the hurt and suffering of those people.

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:57.540
And if you're somebody that says.

01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:58.580
Not even those people,

01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:03.420
you're ignoring the state of language.

01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:04.860
Cause I think you're getting to the point

01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:06.420
cause it's not about a single word.

01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:08.980
It's about like, it's music.

01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:12.860
And I just feel like there is off notes.

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:15.780
It's a strong note that ruins the melody.

01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:16.620
Gotcha.

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:17.980
And I don't think I can say,

01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:19.940
you shouldn't use the R word or whatever.

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.180
I'm just speaking to,

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:22.580
I'm just listening to music

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.780
and reviewing the final result.

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.220
It's not necessarily,

01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:30.740
cause maybe one use of the R word strategically

01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.020
or part of an actual like,

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.220
or when you've built up a camaraderie

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:39.020
that's sandwiched in like some love,

01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:40.700
but then you try to reveal their,

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:42.100
I guess you're talking about a lot of,

01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:43.380
there's a bunch of drama.

01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:46.700
You have friends with whom you're warring and stuff.

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:50.860
And they're all a little bit beautifully insane.

01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:53.380
And you've said that you are becoming more and more insane.

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:54.220
It's beautiful to watch.

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.260
It's the human condition laid before us.

01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:57.100
Wonderful.

01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.700
And some of that is swearing and so on.

01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:00.380
So it's a tricky thing.

01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.900
But the whole skill of discourse,

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.220
just like it is with dark humor is walking that line.

01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:11.700
I just feel like it's overuse of the R word.

01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.260
And I don't want to die in that ground

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.380
cause I don't think it's that represented.

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:17.980
Like there's certain things like that.

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:20.180
It feels like it ruins the music.

01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:21.380
And I don't, you know,

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:23.820
it's the same like a dumb Republican or dumb Democrat.

01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:26.740
I don't, yeah, that ruins it too a little bit.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:28.780
Depends on how you use it.

01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:30.580
You can be lazy with that.

01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.500
You know, like even overuse of the word,

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:34.020
I think bots is what's used

01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:35.660
for people who don't think or something.

01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:37.420
I don't actually know the definition.

01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:39.580
I'm offended on behalf of robots.

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:43.580
That might be a compliment soon.

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:44.420
Exactly.

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:46.340
But I guess bot means you don't think.

01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.500
Yeah, you're like an NPC.

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.700
You just copy and paste.

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:50.540
Again, I'm offended on behalf of NPCs.

01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:52.340
I count myself as one.

01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:55.900
There's a sense if you say bots too much

01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:58.140
that you're just dismissing people.

01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:01.380
Like everything I say is right.

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:04.580
And anyone that disagrees with me is a bot.

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:05.740
That's lazy too.

01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:06.660
Sometimes it's funny.

01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:08.860
Sometimes it's effective.

01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:11.260
Basically saying a lot of people in the mainstream media

01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:12.220
or something like that are bots.

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:15.300
Okay, that's, a little bit of that is effective.

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.260
But too much, it becomes ineffective.

01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:19.860
And I'm trying to speak to that.

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:24.140
And I'm just, the reason we're highlighting clear examples

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.340
like the N-word.

01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.180
Joe Rogan had to contend with that.

01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:30.980
I think it's ineffective.

01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:33.060
It makes you less effective at discourse.

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:35.780
But like you've talked about many times,

01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:37.620
language is a tricky one.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:38.820
It's always hard because you talk about

01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.020
constructing a melody.

01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.820
There's not one melody that sounds good to everyone.

01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:44.140
But there are probably certain notes

01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:46.340
that if you got rid of them,

01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.060
everybody's still gonna like it about as much

01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:48.980
and you don't really lose anything.

01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:50.300
There's a whole other part of an audience

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:52.540
that might be more willing to listen, of course.

01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:55.140
And it's not about losing the magic of that melody.

01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.620
You don't wanna be vanilla.

01:38:57.740 --> 01:38:58.860
I just feel like there's stuff

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:00.300
that doesn't need to be there.

01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:01.140
Yeah, for sure.

01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.220
It's fat.

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.420
But then again, the other thing that people

01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:07.420
should understand that might be listening to this,

01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:11.460
you're streaming many hours a day for many years.

01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:12.300
I don't know, what's it?

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.540
11 or 12, I think, yeah.

01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:14.620
Started in 2010.

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:16.220
And so one of the things that people can do

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:18.260
is just clip out anything.

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:21.860
You're going through the full human experience of emotion.

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.660
Anger, fear, frustration, all of it.

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.580
So of course, there's going to be moments

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.740
when you're not the best version of yourself.

01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:33.140
Anything else to say about the language?

01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:34.540
It's complicated.

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.220
I'm still always trying to figure it out.

01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:37.340
There are opinions that I have

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.940
that have changed throughout the years.

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:41.420
It's possible that the R word has always been the next one

01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:43.060
on the chopping block that we're all kind of looking at,

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:44.980
but people are always worried about that treadmill.

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.060
But it's possible in a year or two,

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.100
I'll have a different view on it

01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:50.380
or I'll have changed away some of the words I use.

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:51.380
Yeah, it's definitely like a,

01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:52.500
it's always like a work in progress.

01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:53.700
There's always like different communities

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:56.140
that feel different ways about different words, yeah.

01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:56.980
Yeah, but do you acknowledge

01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:59.060
that there's people out there

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.860
that are never going to talk to you?

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:05.780
They're never going to think of you as a good man

01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:09.180
because you used the N word with the hard R publicly.

01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.220
In the past?

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:11.540
I mean, yeah, those people exist,

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:16.140
but I mean, there are some people that are beyond my reach,

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:17.260
which I'm okay with.

01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.180
Like there's going to be some people

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:19.100
because of things that have been involved,

01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:20.620
or even ideas that I have now

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:23.100
that might make them beyond my reach.

01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:25.500
Something you said earlier is very true.

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.140
I think the goal is to identify

01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:29.140
what are the elements that you can cut out

01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:30.900
that aren't integral to your message,

01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:34.180
but could be alienating to more people.

01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:35.740
And those are probably the things that you identify.

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:38.140
But I think that you can get lost in yourself

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:39.380
or lost in the internet

01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:42.340
or lost in the outside of yourself

01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:44.180
if you're trying to appeal to every single person.

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:45.860
That's just never going to be the case.

01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:48.820
And for, I actually, I like that I've had

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.220
the journey that I've had on the internet

01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:51.540
that you can find me saying

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.020
and defending a lot of insane stuff 10 years ago,

01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:55.780
because I think it shows a level of progress.

01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:57.260
And I think I do get a lot of respect

01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:58.820
and buy into certain communities

01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:00.820
where it's like, I'm not just some random dude

01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:01.660
telling you that like,

01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.940
oh, you shouldn't say the F word or the N word.

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.500
I'm a guy that's been there, that's done it,

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:06.340
that's defended it.

01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:07.300
And you can see my whole past,

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:08.580
my whole history is laid bare

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:12.140
for you to watch every thousands of hours of it.

01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.380
But I can show that there's growth

01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:15.500
and evolution and change that can happen in a person.

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.380
Yeah, and you're honest about that growth.

01:41:18.380 --> 01:41:19.540
It's a tricky thing

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:23.220
because people just bring up stuff from your past.

01:41:24.060 --> 01:41:27.020
I hope we figure out as a civilization,

01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:30.460
a mechanism to clearly say this was,

01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:31.620
this was me two years ago,

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:33.580
this was me five years ago,

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:34.780
I'm a different person.

01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:38.620
And like, because Twitter doesn't care about that.

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.660
These social mechanisms that bring stuff up

01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:42.220
doesn't care about that.

01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:44.700
It's like one stupid thing you say,

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.740
it becomes like a Scarlet Letter.

01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:47.940
And I don't know how to fight that.

01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:49.260
It's tricky to fight that.

01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:50.980
Have you ever seen Men in Black?

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:51.820
Yes.

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:53.540
I saw K and J are on the bench and he says,

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.540
person is smart, but people are stupid,

01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.500
dumb, finicky animals or whatever.

01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:59.860
There's something that changes for human dynamics

01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:01.860
when there is a group of people

01:42:01.860 --> 01:42:03.180
that make it so hard to control.

01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:04.140
Like I think one-on-one,

01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.180
anybody can sit across from somebody

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:07.940
and admit to some horrible stuff.

01:42:07.940 --> 01:42:09.620
I used to be a,

01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.780
I abused my husband when I was 20 and now I'm 35

01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:14.020
and I see what's wrong or I did this,

01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:15.020
I was addicted to whatever.

01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:16.220
And I made these mistakes.

01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:17.700
A one-on-one, it's always easy.

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:20.900
But in group environments that in-group, out-group,

01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.980
it's a tri-ballistic thing of identifying one thing

01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:24.540
and then coming to destroy a person's life

01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:27.900
is such a huge impulse we have.

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:30.420
And I think probably when we were hunter-gatherers

01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:31.900
in the forest, it's probably good

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:34.100
because you really wanna push weird people out

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:34.940
or anything like that.

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:35.980
But now on the internet,

01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:38.500
when we can hunt for any dissenting opinion

01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.300
and just with ruthless precision,

01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:41.540
destroy somebody's life over it,

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.420
it's a pretty scary dynamic.

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:45.980
I think one of the mechanisms that could fix it

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:49.300
is make it super easy for each individual person

01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:50.900
to analyze all the stupid shit

01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:52.900
they themselves have said in the past.

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.340
Like a full recording.

01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:58.860
Because I think people just honestly paint

01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:00.740
a very rosy picture to their own brain

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:03.460
of who they have been in the past.

01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:04.300
Yeah, of course.

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.980
If we can have empathy for the fact

01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.860
that we've said stupid shit or we're drunk,

01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:10.500
the ridiculous things you say,

01:43:10.500 --> 01:43:12.420
the offensive things you might have said,

01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:13.740
the offensive things you might have done,

01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:18.740
I just feel like that would give us the ammunition

01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.300
to have empathy for others that are like,

01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:23.860
okay, yeah, this guy five years ago said this.

01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:27.620
Maybe that doesn't represent who they are

01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:29.980
any more than stuff I said five years ago

01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:32.420
represents who I am today.

01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:34.820
I feel like technology can actually enable that.

01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:37.420
Maybe, although you're talking about more recording

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.420
and more stuff which people are already wary of.

01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:42.100
It's a double-edged sword.

01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:44.500
I think there is going to be more and more recording.

01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:45.700
We have to figure out how to do that

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:47.820
in the way that respects people's privacy

01:43:47.940 --> 01:43:49.940
and gives them ownership of their data and so on.

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:52.860
I've looked at the search history I've done on Google,

01:43:52.860 --> 01:43:54.580
which for most people is available,

01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:56.380
like your Google search history,

01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:59.740
and it's fascinating to watch the evolution of a human being.

01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:01.460
It doesn't seem like the same person.

01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:02.460
It's like a different person.

01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:03.460
For sure.

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.300
It's weird.

01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:05.900
It's also hard too with the internet today.

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:07.300
I'm going to be agist again,

01:44:07.300 --> 01:44:09.940
but now all of the people are thrown together.

01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:13.380
Whereas I don't want a 27-year-old judging

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.580
the language of a 15 or 16-year-old.

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.020
Obviously he's in high school.

01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:18.540
There is that story that came out of the,

01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:20.740
there was a kid that saved the recording of,

01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:22.180
I think it was like some white girl.

01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:23.900
I think that she got her driver's license

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:25.260
and she was like, I can drive now,

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.860
N words with the A or whatever.

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:27.860
It was dumb, she shouldn't have said it,

01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.260
but I think she was like 15 or 16

01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:31.060
when she TikTok'd this or whatever.

01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:33.060
And he held on to that recording until she applied

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:35.140
and got accepted to college three years later,

01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:37.220
and then he released it to get her kicked out of college.

01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.420
And I'm like, damn.

01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:40.860
If everything that I had ever said

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:44.540
as a 15, 16-year-old was immortalized on the internet,

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:46.100
my life wouldn't have even begun.

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:51.260
And those are insanely high standards to hold people to.

01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:53.460
Not that like, obviously you shouldn't be saying those,

01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:54.780
you shouldn't be saying certain words or whatever,

01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:57.620
but you have to be able to make mistakes in adolescence.

01:44:57.620 --> 01:44:59.220
Like everybody does, we all did.

01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:01.700
Everybody did it growing up, you know?

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.900
Why do you think there is so much misogyny

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:06.140
in the streaming community?

01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.700
And how can you fight it?

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:11.860
Because you've shown a lot of interest in fighting it,

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:14.540
trying to decrease or eliminate misogyny

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:15.380
from your community.

01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:17.620
I think it's really difficult.

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:19.420
I think that eliminating racism is easier

01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:21.540
than eliminating misogyny.

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:22.740
On the internet, you mean?

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.140
On anywhere.

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:25.420
Because I think fundamentally,

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:26.340
I don't think there's that much difference

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:27.940
between like white people and black people

01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:30.140
and brown people and Asian people or whatever.

01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.300
You know, we have different cultures and stuff,

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.380
but at the end of the day, we're all people.

01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:36.380
But I think there are differences between men and women,

01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:38.940
like throughout all of history and time,

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.820
and then even today in every culture.

01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:42.940
And when real differences do exist,

01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:44.580
it's harder to account for them in a way

01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:46.580
that can we have conversations with each other

01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:49.700
without it becoming very gendered in a negative way, right?

01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.020
Negative way of gendering something,

01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.900
be it like a misogynistic way of doing it.

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:57.380
Of course, it's unclear to me that it's so difficult

01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:02.380
to avoid the negative gendering versus the positive,

01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.620
because there's a lot of positive to the tension,

01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:06.620
the dance between the different genders and so on.

01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:09.820
Maybe in this particular moment in history, it's not.

01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:11.340
But it's not trivial to me

01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:13.060
that racism is easier to eliminate.

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.980
It's an interesting hypothesis

01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:17.460
just because there's more biological difference

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.700
between men and women.

01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:20.820
That means it's harder to eliminate, but.

01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:21.660
I don't know if this is true.

01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:22.500
I hear this a lot.

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:23.320
I feel like I read this somewhere,

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:24.160
but I need to get a better source

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:25.000
where I repeat it everywhere.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.220
But I've heard that like in the US military, for instance,

01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:29.260
they've gotten exceedingly well,

01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:30.660
they do an exceedingly good job

01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:33.660
at getting different people of different races to integrate.

01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:35.220
And it's like not a huge problem

01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:36.860
once you're through basic training,

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.220
all the training, everything.

01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:39.460
But for different sexes,

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:41.140
it still represents a significant problem

01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.660
that the military hasn't figured out.

01:46:43.300 --> 01:46:44.140
And I actually looked at like,

01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:44.960
well, what's the military doing?

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:45.800
Because if something was solvable,

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.780
like can we sleep for four hours a night and be healthy?

01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.420
If we could, I bet the military would know.

01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:50.420
So I kind of looked sometimes to them

01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:51.260
to see their integration,

01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:52.940
but it might be that there are other issues there

01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:53.780
that make it-

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:54.860
Yeah, it feels like the military

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:55.700
is a very particular kind of-

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:56.620
For sure, yeah, it could be.

01:46:56.620 --> 01:47:01.580
The actual task at hand might bias

01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.220
the difficulty of the process.

01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:04.380
Potentially, yeah.

01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:06.780
There's been a lot of interesting talk

01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:10.740
about like women integrating into male groups.

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:12.700
And how do you do this in a way

01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:15.260
where everybody is happy with the outcome

01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:18.100
and there's not like issues?

01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:19.980
I think Jordan Peterson spoke about this a little bit.

01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:22.300
And then Workplace Culture speaks about this a bit.

01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:24.300
Would you happen to remember,

01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:26.260
I wanna say it was like five or 10 years ago,

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:27.900
there was a big tech conference

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.500
and there were two guys behind a woman

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:32.180
and they made a joke about like a USB dongle,

01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:33.620
like dongle was a dick.

01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:35.980
And this woman turned around, she tweeted pictures of them,

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.300
spoke about like misogyny,

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:40.120
and then that blew up into a huge ordeal

01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.720
that like, yeah, there was this interesting phenomenon

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:47.560
that in a less misogynistic

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.120
and more inclusive workplace environment,

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:53.400
some women might end up feeling worse

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.960
because in a more misogynistic environment,

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:56.720
you're thinking like, okay, that's a woman,

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.680
she doesn't get our humor,

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:00.400
I'm gonna treat her in a very indifferent,

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.360
very dispassionate, cold way and whatever,

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.560
and then I'm gonna have my boys over here.

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.600
And then you've got like these environments

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.600
where they're a little bit more warmer

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.560
and it's like, oh cool,

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.040
we're gonna bring this woman into our environment

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.200
and we're gonna make all the same types

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:11.960
of like crass jokes we did before

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:13.080
and it's actually worse now.

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.520
Another woman feels even more otherized

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.600
because like, oh my God, why do you talk like this?

01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:18.000
I think that internet communities,

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.480
especially online ones that do like political debate

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:23.600
and video games are very much like big boys clubs.

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.360
So it's not enough to just say,

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:27.880
you can't be misogynistic to get rid of misogyny,

01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:30.040
there's always gonna be an othering effect on women.

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:32.540
There's a lot of like behaviors that are unintuitive

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:33.520
that you have to account for

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:35.480
and you've got to try to like push that back

01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:38.720
and that's just a very, very, very challenging thing to do.

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:40.840
I like to deal with concrete examples more.

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:42.200
So here's a concrete example.

01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.080
And this is like a recent initiative in my community

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.160
because I'm trying to like be,

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.960
because misogyny hasn't been fixed anywhere on the internet

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.800
and I'm curious, well, there are ways

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.320
that I can push my community to do this.

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.000
I don't think you should almost ever make a comment

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.400
on a woman's appearance ever

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.000
if they're appearing in like some political

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.200
or professional manner.

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:57.640
Even if it's a positive comment,

01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:59.560
I think it's equally bad to a negative comment.

01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:01.120
It's just never good to do.

01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.400
And that's kind of an unintuitive thing

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.960
because it's like, well, a woman appears,

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.280
wow, she's really cute.

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.160
It seems like a nice comment.

01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:07.700
You're being nice, you know, she looks cute or whatever,

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:09.620
but it's like, it's not at all the point of why she's there.

01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:10.860
And just by saying that,

01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:12.740
you're kind of like otherizing her as like a person

01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:14.460
to like think she looks good

01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:17.060
rather than listening to anything she has to say, you know?

01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:19.900
Well, there's a lot of stuff that you're saying

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:23.660
and that is a part of misogyny.

01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:26.020
It's almost like obvious.

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.660
Like any woman will tell you that.

01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:29.340
Woman will, yeah, but they're not in these spaces

01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:30.460
and a lot of the guys don't know.

01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:35.460
I think what that requires is just empathy.

01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:36.820
You don't need, you don't need,

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:40.300
you need to consider the female experience.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.140
That's it.

01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:44.060
Like you have to either read about or talk with women.

01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:47.420
You learn, like the low-hanging fruit is very easy to learn.

01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:49.620
It feels like just the level of social skill

01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:54.180
oftentimes in internet communities is quite low.

01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.060
I disagree.

01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:57.580
I don't like to say, here's the problem with empathy

01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:00.140
is it's very hard to have empathy for experiences

01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:02.420
that are so outside of your own.

01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:03.460
Well, maybe some people,

01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:05.220
there might be some people that can do it, I can't.

01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:07.060
There's a lot of stuff that I had to learn.

01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:08.780
Women are half the population.

01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:09.780
But they're women.

01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.100
They're totally different.

01:50:12.100 --> 01:50:14.540
They're totally different.

01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:16.820
We'll talk about, we'll write so.

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:18.380
They're not totally different.

01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:19.620
So here's an example, okay?

01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:22.340
So especially for me,

01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:25.020
my archetype makes up a lot of the internet.

01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.260
White man.

01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:28.340
There's never been a point.

01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:29.900
The name of a beautiful woman.

01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:30.940
Who might be a dancer.

01:50:30.940 --> 01:50:31.980
What's the backstory?

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:33.260
From New Orleans or?

01:50:33.260 --> 01:50:34.700
I haven't thought that through yet.

01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:36.420
It's ambiguous, okay?

01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:37.540
Like an open world.

01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:38.380
An open world.

01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.300
I want you to project whatever,

01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:41.220
wherever you want Destiny the dancer to be from.

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:42.340
That's in your mind, okay?

01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.140
All right, I'll save that for later tonight.

01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:45.980
Yeah, okay.

01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:47.700
As a white guy,

01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:50.380
I don't know if there's ever been a spot that I've been in

01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:52.780
where I've been made to feel like I don't belong there

01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:54.100
just by virtue of who I am.

01:50:54.100 --> 01:50:55.540
I actually don't.

01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:57.420
It's impossible for me to empathize that

01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:59.820
because I don't even have that experience.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:01.900
If you go back eight, nine years,

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:03.340
one of the big issues that came up

01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:05.660
was harassment in gaming against women.

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:08.260
And I was one of the big debaters against that,

01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:11.020
saying that like, sure, women might get harassment,

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:12.620
but everybody gets harassment.

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:14.340
If you're a woman and you're in gaming

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.260
and you get harassed,

01:51:15.260 --> 01:51:16.980
congratulations, you're being treated like a man.

01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:18.340
What you're actually asking for

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:19.660
is for us to actually treat you differently.

01:51:19.660 --> 01:51:21.060
You don't want to be insulted.

01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:22.300
You don't want to be treated like a man.

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.540
And that's actually misogyny,

01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:24.740
is women making that argument.

01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:26.300
Do you still stand by that?

01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:28.020
Is that a problem if I do?

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:29.300
No, I'm just kidding.

01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:30.660
Okay, hold on.

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:31.500
It's a little while after.

01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:32.620
I disagree with it.

01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:33.460
Sure, okay.

01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:34.340
That's good, you should.

01:51:34.340 --> 01:51:35.700
A little while later,

01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:38.340
I had a friend, Jessica, super cool girl.

01:51:38.340 --> 01:51:39.420
We go to play games.

01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:40.380
She was between jobs.

01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:41.580
And she's like, I've got like two months

01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:42.860
and we're going to grind CSGO.

01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:44.140
And I'm like, okay, this is awesome.

01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:45.100
Let's do it.

01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.220
CSGO, Counter-Strike, Global Offensive,

01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:49.780
shooter game, FPS, microphones.

01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:50.980
First day we start playing, okay.

01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:52.300
Hop into our first game.

01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:53.380
Obviously she talks.

01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:55.100
Everybody's making, is that a 12 year old boy?

01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:56.180
Why aren't you making sandwiches?

01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:57.020
Blah, blah, blah.

01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:57.840
Yeah, okay, whatever.

01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:58.680
Play our first game,

01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:00.060
play our second game, same jokes.

01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:01.260
Third game, fourth game.

01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:03.260
By like the fourth or fifth game,

01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:04.740
I was actually starting to feel triggered.

01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:05.980
Like every time the game started,

01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:07.220
I was like, can you just like talk

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.100
so we can get over like the stupid fucking jokes?

01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:10.580
It's so fucking stupid.

01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:13.700
And you hear the same fucking joke every single time.

01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:16.140
And it took one day of that experience

01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:19.060
for me to realize it's not about being insulted.

01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:21.420
It's like this othering feeling that you don't belong.

01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:23.020
And I've never felt that because I'm a white guy.

01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:24.860
Like it's just not to be like virtually similar.

01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:26.500
So there's no places where it's like,

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:27.540
you're white, you don't belong here.

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:29.260
You're a guy, you don't belong here.

01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:31.060
Like I've never felt that non-inclusion.

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:34.380
And playing with her, there's a different feeling

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:36.640
when it's the same types of jokes coming

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.020
from a group of people to make you feel

01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:39.660
like you don't belong there.

01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:42.500
Where it was like, damn, this actually feels really bad.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.220
And it feels bad in a different way where it's like,

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:48.100
if you call me like an F slur or any other type

01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:50.100
of swear word or insult, like, yeah, you can call me that.

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:51.900
But at the end of the day, like we're all kind of the same.

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:53.660
We're all white dudes and we call each other names.

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:56.220
But like, this is a woman and this is not her place

01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:58.160
and she doesn't belong here.

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.000
Kind of the analogy that I would make,

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.560
because after getting these experiences,

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.280
I would learn this afterwards.

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.820
If I tell you that there's another guy in a room

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:07.720
and you need to think of the worst insults ever

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:09.400
for that person without ever knowing anything

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:10.760
about them or meeting them.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.760
If I tell you that it's like a white straight guy

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:15.160
and you have to write insults, you're fucked.

01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:16.760
Maybe you can do like school shooter,

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.360
but there's not really much you can say

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.400
at the end of the day.

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:21.360
But if I tell you it's a woman, woof,

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.040
there are so many different jokes you can write.

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.480
If it's a black person, so many different racist things

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.300
we can say.

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:27.140
Are you sure?

01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:28.840
I can come up with a lot of stuff for a white guy.

01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.400
In terms of stuff that is just intrinsic

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:31.800
to him being a white guy.

01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:33.420
Yeah, like there's-

01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:34.260
Really?

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:36.080
Wait a minute, what are you talking about?

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.520
There's a lot, the internet has sharpened that sword.

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:42.680
In terms of like jokes that are targeted at his sex-

01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:46.600
Incel, virgin, weak.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.320
Some of the incel, virgin, maybe.

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.540
Yeah, that's getting there, sure.

01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:50.380
That's for sure.

01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:52.960
That's recent though, sorry, I'm older on the internet.

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.520
We didn't have those words way back then.

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.120
That wasn't- When I was making these analogies,

01:53:56.120 --> 01:53:57.560
that incel and virgin- Back in my day,

01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:59.920
we didn't have gender- There were no incels back then.

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:01.240
None of us had sex, we just accepted it.

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:02.400
We were all computer gamers.

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.440
Nobody had sex and played video games back then, okay?

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.280
People don't remember that.

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:06.440
There wasn't the big bang theory.

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.280
You were just a loser that was stuck in a circle.

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:09.120
You guys didn't even know sex existed.

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:09.960
Exactly, yeah.

01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:10.780
You can use it as an incel.

01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:12.760
We had to download sexual pictures in like two minutes

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:14.160
and you didn't even know if you were gonna get the right thing

01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.400
by the time it finished loading.

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.160
But what I'm saying is like, okay,

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:19.740
I think you agree that if somebody gives you a race,

01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:21.400
like a black person who's a woman,

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:25.120
we can write very cutting, scathing incels for that person

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.200
that are very authorizing.

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:28.120
Or words that would really hurt-

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:30.080
Yeah, that are very cutting to the person.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:33.080
But like for a white guy, it's kind of hard

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.480
because that's like the default.

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.400
There's not as much otherizing of those people.

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.240
Yeah.

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:40.040
So the incels you have from white guy to white guy,

01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.760
the incels are much harsher.

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.040
So when you start to apply the same kind of harshness

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:45.280
to other groups-

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:47.540
You can make them feel like they really don't belong.

01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:49.400
And that otherizing effect is something

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.400
that's very hard for me.

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.340
I can't really empathize because I've never felt it.

01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:54.640
So I have to intellectualize it and then sympathize with it.

01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.200
It's like a whole process I have to go through.

01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.080
And then I try to walk other people through that

01:54:58.080 --> 01:54:59.600
because if you're a white guy on the internet,

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:00.520
which is a lot of the internet,

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:01.640
you really don't know what that feels like.

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.160
You've never felt like that before.

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:08.080
So you're now in a leadership position, grandpa destiny.

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:11.440
So that's, a lot of people look up to you for that,

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:14.200
for that sort of pathway to empathy.

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:15.480
Yeah.

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:17.440
How not to otherize.

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.280
I mean, you have felt otherizing.

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:22.440
You mentioned high school people like not being-

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:24.380
Yeah, but those were always for things that like,

01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:25.860
it's different to insult somebody

01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:27.740
for a non-immutable characteristic.

01:55:27.740 --> 01:55:29.200
Like, okay, you think poorly about me

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:31.280
because I'm like not enough money or I don't have money,

01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:33.060
but I could get more money and I could change that.

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.780
But it's different for somebody to really attack you

01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:37.980
for like your gender or attack you for like your race.

01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:39.740
A lot of the attacks that hit the hardest

01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:40.900
is not about gender.

01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:44.940
I do think that they're like,

01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:47.960
the way women are attacked on the internet,

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:50.060
it's the same kind of attacks you would do

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:52.620
towards other guys, but you go harsher.

01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:54.540
I feel like they're fundamentally different.

01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:56.420
I feel like when we're attacking guys,

01:55:56.420 --> 01:56:00.540
I'm not usually attacking you on like the virtue

01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:03.860
of you being a guy, but like if it's a woman

01:56:03.860 --> 01:56:04.700
and she's typing something like,

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:06.400
oh, did your boyfriend type that for you?

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.660
Or like, what are you even doing here?

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.680
Like, don't you, shouldn't you be trying to find a husband

01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:11.100
or like, oh, you're like a stupid cunt,

01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:12.220
like go start an OnlyFans or whatever.

01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.300
No, but the stupidity, the intelligence aspect

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.140
is what's attacked.

01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:16.220
Yeah, but it's so much different.

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:17.700
Like you can call a guy stupid,

01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:19.500
but that's because he's a guy that's being stupid.

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:20.580
But when you call a woman stupid,

01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.940
she's stupid because she's a woman.

01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:25.500
Yeah, but I honestly think that women are called stupid

01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.780
more than men on the internet.

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:32.260
But it's nothing to do, like the attack is not gendered.

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:37.260
It's the gender inspires an increased level of attack.

01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:38.780
I feel like it is gendered.

01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:40.700
I wish we had data on this.

01:56:40.700 --> 01:56:42.640
Have you ever heard of the XKCD comics?

01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:43.480
Yes.

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:44.520
It's a really good comic where,

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:45.900
and this is something that I've dealt with

01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.660
a lot in my community, okay?

01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:51.040
There's a guy at a board and he fucks up a math equation

01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:52.960
and it's like, wow, you suck at math.

01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:55.120
And then the next panelist, there's a girl that does it

01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:57.920
and she fucks it up and it's like, wow, women suck at math.

01:56:57.920 --> 01:56:59.560
And there's like that feeling that happens

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.680
where when I bring on, I won't use names,

01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:04.160
but they're like YouTube people that I brought on

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:05.760
that have crazy opinions.

01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:08.240
And when they're men, that person is crazy.

01:57:08.240 --> 01:57:09.880
Oh my God, he said the crazy stuff.

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:12.000
He's so dumb, he's so crazy, so stupid.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.120
But when it's a woman, it's like, oh my God,

01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:15.440
why do you always bring dumb women here?

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:17.560
Why do so many women on the internet have crazy opinions?

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.260
There's a different like minority character

01:57:19.260 --> 01:57:21.500
that has to like stand it and like represent

01:57:21.500 --> 01:57:24.360
like their whole group where like white men

01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:25.420
don't typically have to.

01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:27.820
Speaking of groups versus individuals, yes.

01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:31.800
But then what I feel happens is then another person

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.200
from that group comes, another woman comes

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:39.200
and people before she says anything will already feel like

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.100
they're ready with that attack.

01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:41.940
For sure.

01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.740
But they're ready for the attack because she's a woman.

01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:45.420
They're gonna call her, she's stupid because she's a woman,

01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:46.260
not because she says something,

01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:48.400
they want just because she's a woman.

01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:53.240
So like the group in their brain accumulates

01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.840
all the negative characteristics

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.440
of the individuals they've met.

01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:57.800
Not the positive, the negative.

01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.120
And it becomes like this ball of stickiness

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:03.120
and then that becomes the bias for their judgment

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:05.000
of a new person that comes.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.440
With white men, there's more of a blank slate

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.980
in terms of bias of how they analyze the person.

01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:12.280
With any of the minority group,

01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.800
they basically make a judgment

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.560
based on the negative characteristics

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:18.040
of the individuals they've met in the past.

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:22.080
That leads to a system where you're just harsher

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.720
towards minority groups and towards women.

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:26.040
How do you solve that?

01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:27.840
The most important thing for any problem ever

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.400
is step one is to be aware of it.

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.640
If you're not aware of it,

01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:33.220
then you're hopelessly lost at sea.

01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:34.780
But yeah, the first thing I like to say is just like,

01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:35.620
be aware of it.

01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:37.400
I've had, there's a girl that I've had on recently

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:40.080
and she says a lot of, in my opinion, kind of crazy things,

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:41.400
but people will use her as like,

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:42.640
this is why women shouldn't be here.

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:44.640
This is like, she's crazy and she's a woman and blah, blah,

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:45.480
blah.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:47.120
But I can bring in a guy who says similarly dumb things

01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:49.440
and he's evaluated on his own merits

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:50.760
because it's a guy, you know?

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:52.380
There's never, ever, ever been a case

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:53.880
where I brought a stupid guy on stream

01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:56.160
and everybody's like, this guy makes me hate men.

01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.400
This guy makes me hate white people.

01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:58.640
That has never happened.

01:58:58.640 --> 01:59:00.240
But then there's like other women that come on

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:02.080
and it's like, now I know why insults exist

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:03.840
or I totally understand where red pill ideology

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:04.680
comes from, you know?

01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:06.760
And even if the statements are kind of true,

01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:07.920
when you're making these observations

01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.140
over and over and over and over again,

01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:12.800
it damages your ability to individually perceive somebody.

01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.580
And then two people that make the same statements,

01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.240
one can be perceived more harshly

01:59:16.280 --> 01:59:18.400
just because of that group bias you've got built up.

01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.800
I think there's something about streaming

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:21.320
that just brings that out of people,

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.520
because you have to talk for like seven hours.

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:24.800
So you're like, all right, well,

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:28.080
whatever psychological issues and complexities I have,

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:28.920
I'm going to explore them.

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.160
They're going to be magnified too.

01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:33.440
Magnified and then it's the, as you talked about,

01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:37.360
the mimetic theories or Gerardian,

01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:40.400
like whatever the things that are very similar

01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:43.240
and you're going to magnify the conflicts that you have

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:46.140
and you're going to explore all the different perspectives

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:47.880
and those different conflicts.

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:50.140
And I mean, I don't know if it's just anecdotal,

01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:52.820
but it's nice to have women on stream.

01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:57.540
I think the dynamic that you guys have is wonderful.

01:59:57.540 --> 01:59:58.940
It's really interesting.

01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:01.180
So it's just the female voice in general.

02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:03.760
I love having women on the podcast.

02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:07.580
The female voice I feel like is underheard on the internet.

02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:08.420
For sure.

02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:10.420
And I would love the internet to be a place

02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.980
where women feel safe to speak.

02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:15.060
All right, given that you're,

02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:17.140
like we talked about a progressive

02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:19.780
with non-standard progressive views.

02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:24.580
So you're very pro-free speech, pro-capitalism.

02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:26.060
So given that, it's very interesting

02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:30.260
that you're also pro-establishment and pro-institutions.

02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:32.900
So right now, if you look at the world,

02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:36.020
there's a significant distrust of institutions,

02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:39.420
at least in sort of public intellectual discourse.

02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:41.220
What is the nature of your support

02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:42.820
for government and institutions?

02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.460
Can you make the case for and against them?

02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:51.460
Broadly speaking, there is a synergistic effect

02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:53.440
when two humans come together.

02:00:53.440 --> 02:00:56.800
If I can speak very broadly in terms of,

02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:58.660
we'll say utility, okay?

02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:01.660
My happiness with one person might be 10.

02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:03.580
The happiness with the other person might be 10.

02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:04.820
When they come together,

02:01:04.820 --> 02:01:06.540
it's like 50 between the two of them.

02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.940
There's like the synergistic effect

02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:11.300
when humans work together that the sum is greater

02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:12.700
than all the individual parts or whatever.

02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:14.660
There's like an emergent thing that happens there.

02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:17.220
There's a capacity, there's a possibility of that.

02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:18.340
Yeah, a possibility, sure.

02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:19.420
Things could go really wrong.

02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:20.620
There could be a cannibalistic tribe

02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:21.980
that all eats each other, sure.

02:01:21.980 --> 02:01:23.140
But for the purposes of this-

02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:25.180
There's other failure modes, but yes.

02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:26.020
Okay, sure, yeah.

02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:28.740
But I think broadly speaking,

02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:30.300
are you gonna be the well actually guy?

02:01:30.300 --> 02:01:32.100
Okay, if you wanna well, okay.

02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:33.940
Well actually, sometimes- Sometimes cannibalism

02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:36.060
is actually good for both.

02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:37.940
True, yeah, sometimes things do go wrong.

02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:39.080
But I think broadly speaking,

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:40.900
the fact that you're sitting here in clothing

02:01:40.900 --> 02:01:42.300
that you didn't make and I'm sitting here

02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:44.460
on an airplane that I don't know how to fly or build,

02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:46.420
like right, there's a lot of cool stuff that happens

02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:49.760
when people come together and they make civilizations.

02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.580
And part of that civilization building

02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:54.940
is the fact that we can specialize

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:58.180
and it's the fact that we can offload a bunch of trust

02:01:58.180 --> 02:02:01.380
onto third parties that we delegate the power

02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:03.900
to make important decisions about our lives, right?

02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:06.860
I don't know anything about how to like build

02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:08.300
like a combustion engine,

02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:09.780
but I know that when I push the button on my car,

02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:12.140
it's gonna drive around and the fumes aren't gonna kill me

02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:13.420
and I can park it in garages

02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:14.700
and the building's not gonna collapse.

02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:16.380
And the only reason all of this works

02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:17.860
is because I've offloaded a lot of trust

02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:19.580
onto these third party things.

02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:21.660
And I would say that the pillars of these third party things

02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:25.340
that society is built on are roughly speaking institutions.

02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:27.920
So that might be the institution of peer review

02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:29.700
for scientific articles.

02:02:29.700 --> 02:02:33.660
It might be the institution of voting for government, right?

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:36.980
Or the ability for us to vote in that whole process.

02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:38.380
It might, yeah, the FDA,

02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:39.720
like all of these institutions are things

02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:42.840
that they need to exist because we don't have the time

02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:44.920
or the capability to individually sort through

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:47.080
all of these things individually.

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:49.600
We have to rely on some third party to do it.

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:53.800
Okay, so you believe at scale,

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:55.280
when we're together,

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.040
we're greater than the sum of our parts.

02:02:57.040 --> 02:02:58.680
That's the case for institutions.

02:02:58.680 --> 02:02:59.600
Absolutely.

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:02.800
What about the inefficiencies of bureaucracy?

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.440
Is there some aspect when at scale,

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:08.520
different dynamics come into play than they do

02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.160
when there's two people together,

02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:13.380
two people that love each other, the birds and the bees.

02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:16.320
Is there some aspect that leads more to cannibalism

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:17.280
at scale?

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.160
So like corruption, inefficiencies that do to bureaucracy

02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:21.200
and so on.

02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:23.480
Bureaucracy, which is not,

02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:26.000
I hate it when people try to say bureaucracy is government

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.480
because bureaucracy exists a ton in private environments

02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:29.320
as well, right?

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:30.640
In businesses and everything.

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.460
Bureaucracy introduces its own set of problems.

02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:35.680
But I mean, a bureaucracy is necessary

02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:38.200
because it's coordinating all of the underlying things

02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:40.300
in order to create something that's greater

02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:42.280
than the sum of its parts, right?

02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:44.620
Like all of the software developers in the world

02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:46.680
are useless without being paired with good designers

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:48.680
in order to make their products usable by a person.

02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:50.320
And the coordination of those people

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:52.200
and the coordination of increasingly more and more things

02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:54.520
necessitates some level of bureaucracy.

02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.120
I think we always say bureaucracy when it's like a bad,

02:03:57.120 --> 02:03:59.200
it's like a slur almost like you're a bureaucrat,

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:00.040
you're bureaucratic.

02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:01.160
The bureaucracy is slowing everything down.

02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:03.340
It's like, sure, the bureaucracy slows things down,

02:04:03.340 --> 02:04:06.020
but bureaucracy also gives us things like safe medicine

02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:08.180
and safe water to drink for most of the US

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:11.260
or safe buildings to live in or safe cars to drive, so.

02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:13.260
So the managers in institution

02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:16.140
versus like the software developers and the designers,

02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:18.100
the managers is the bureaucracy.

02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:21.300
The reason bureaucracy is used as a slur

02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:23.980
is that something about human nature

02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:27.860
leads to bureaucracy often growing indefinitely

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:32.380
and becoming less and less efficient.

02:04:32.380 --> 02:04:35.620
Without, I mean, this is where capitalism can come in,

02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:39.660
is that capitalism puts a pressure on the bureaucracy

02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:40.840
not to grow too much,

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:44.440
because you want the bureaucracy to be useful,

02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:47.220
but not large.

02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:49.340
Yeah, to be a certain size, yeah, of course.

02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:53.140
To be the minimum size to get the job done.

02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:55.880
And so capitalism provides that mechanism.

02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:00.900
Government does not always.

02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:03.640
And so that's the criticism of government, of institutions,

02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:06.520
where it can grow without a significant mechanism

02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:09.360
that says there's a cost to bureaucracy

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.200
that's not being accounted for here.

02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:15.060
We're just paying for the increasing size of government

02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:16.900
without the benefit.

02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:18.720
Yeah, government is a special institution

02:05:18.720 --> 02:05:20.520
because it doesn't have to show itself

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:22.160
to be financially viable.

02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:23.740
And we kind of live in a capitalist economy

02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:25.040
where that's generally the case.

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:27.840
So government gets its powers from votes from the people,

02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:30.720
which introduces a whole new set of possible positives

02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:32.200
and possible negatives, right?

02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:33.360
Having something, for instance,

02:05:33.360 --> 02:05:35.960
that gives food or shelter to homeless people,

02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:38.800
maybe you don't want that to have to run at a profit.

02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:41.520
But giving an organization that can self justify

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:43.680
its budgets perpetually and indefinitely growing,

02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:45.240
maybe that's not the best thing.

02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:46.440
Yeah, we always have to figure out

02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:48.220
how to do the constraints there.

02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:52.400
What about the corrupting nature of power

02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:54.460
that comes with institutions as well?

02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:55.300
Absolutely.

02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:58.000
So then you better pick your style of institution

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:58.820
very carefully.

02:05:58.820 --> 02:06:00.780
I think that the democratic institution

02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:02.080
we have in the United States today,

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:03.840
I think works very well.

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:05.120
But I mean, there are other styles of government

02:06:05.120 --> 02:06:05.960
that have been tried in the past

02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:08.160
that I think lend themselves more to corruption.

02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.000
Not to say that, by the way,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.280
there's not corruption in the United States.

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:12.440
Of course, there's gonna be varying levels of corruption

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:15.080
at like all, at all levels.

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:17.580
But you ran into this interesting problem

02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:20.100
where authoritarian regimes can act

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:22.580
with ruthless precision and swiftness

02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:24.040
because they don't have to ask any questions.

02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:26.660
They just do, do, do, do, do, and that's it.

02:06:26.660 --> 02:06:28.840
But the problem is, is it's an authoritarian regime.

02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:30.400
They're prone to missteps.

02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:33.400
They're slow to respond to changing or evolving needs.

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:35.120
There was an interesting study that was put out a while ago

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:37.000
that showed that like every single famine

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.120
that happened around the world,

02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:41.880
almost like 98% of them happened under authoritarian regimes

02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:43.360
where like freedom of speech is very limited.

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:46.280
It's very rare for a famine to happen under a democracy

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:48.080
because press and everything makes the government

02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:49.900
more responsive to the needs of the people.

02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:50.740
Power can corrupt.

02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:51.840
There are levels of corruption,

02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:53.880
but you have to have like a system of checks and balances

02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:55.120
on all of those different levels

02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:57.000
to make sure it doesn't run off the rails, I guess,

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.140
and do a sick loop-de-loop,

02:06:58.140 --> 02:06:59.980
and half the population gets.

02:07:00.940 --> 02:07:01.820
Nice callback.

02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:04.220
There's a lot of people that will listen to you say

02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:06.260
that the democracy in the United States

02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:07.900
is working pretty damn well,

02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:11.340
and they will spit out the drink if they're drinking a drink

02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:13.260
and be very upset.

02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:16.220
Can you make the case that they're right and you're wrong?

02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:17.060
Can I make the case-

02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:17.900
Can you steal men?

02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:18.720
They're right, yeah.

02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.840
Well, the steel man for them is that people

02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:22.660
have a lot of problems on the day-to-day,

02:07:22.660 --> 02:07:25.620
and when they look and they see what government is doing,

02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:29.020
they might see potholes outside their house,

02:07:29.020 --> 02:07:31.580
homeless people all over their downtown,

02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:33.120
and the United States just approved

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:36.140
another X billion amount of dollars for Ukraine,

02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:37.980
or they might be living in a city

02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:39.940
where half the factories are shut down,

02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:41.540
a lot of their people are out of work,

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:43.780
but the president is on the TV talking about

02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:46.460
how to find jobs for immigrants coming in from Mexico,

02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:47.420
and for these people,

02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:49.980
they have problems that exist in their lives.

02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:52.700
Some of them are paying taxes to alleviate these problems,

02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:55.340
and then when they listen to the government talk,

02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:57.380
it feels like the government is not responding

02:07:57.380 --> 02:07:59.540
to the needs that they have, and then that's one problem.

02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:01.540
Then on top of that, you've got all of these people

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.020
working in alternative media that can show you,

02:08:03.020 --> 02:08:05.180
well, look at this politician wasting this much money,

02:08:05.180 --> 02:08:07.140
or look at him double speaking here or there.

02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:09.300
Look at Hillary Clinton saying she's got a private position

02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:10.340
and a public position.

02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:11.980
Look at how all of these politicians

02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:13.420
have family members that are getting rich

02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:15.420
because of their relationships with people in Congress.

02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:18.660
Look at the revolving door between capitalist companies

02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:19.500
and the government.

02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:21.140
How can you look at all of that,

02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:22.140
take into account that the government's

02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:23.380
not responding to your needs,

02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:25.000
and then really feel like it's a government

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.240
by the people and for the people?

02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:30.360
Yeah, this was a very good steel man and good question.

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:31.200
How can you?

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:34.080
How can you tell that they're not just politicians

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:37.520
that care more about continuously winning the elections

02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.640
versus running government effectively?

02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:41.960
They should care about winning the elections.

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:43.040
That's the first misconception.

02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:43.880
A lot of people say,

02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:45.600
this guy only cares about getting voted in.

02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:49.240
This guy, he doesn't even believe in fracking or abortion.

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:51.160
He just changes his opinion to get voted in.

02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:53.000
Anytime somebody says that, you should say,

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:53.920
that's really good.

02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.800
You want them to change their opinion so they get voted in.

02:08:55.800 --> 02:08:57.200
That's the whole point of a democracy.

02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:58.660
You don't want them to remain obstinate.

02:08:58.660 --> 02:08:59.500
You don't want them to say,

02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:00.840
I'm not changing my opinion no matter what the people want.

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.960
You want them to evolve and adopt new opinions

02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:04.280
based on what the population,

02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:05.520
their constituents are voting for.

02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:07.640
Yeah, but the cynical take is that

02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:10.220
on the surface, they're changing their opinion,

02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:13.440
but that there's a boys club where boys means the elite

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:18.440
that under, in the smoke-filled rooms in secret,

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.520
they actually have their own agenda

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:21.800
and they're following that agenda

02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:24.160
and they're just saying anything publicly

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:29.160
to placate the public based on whatever the new trends are.

02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:30.720
So here's-

02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:31.920
The cynical take-up plot.

02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:33.080
Yeah, I understand.

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:35.840
Somebody asked me this question and it flipped.

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:37.880
I 180'd completely.

02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:39.600
I was a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:44.040
and my single issue voting thing was lobbying.

02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:45.780
I thought that lobbying, the government was corrupt.

02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:46.700
They weren't responding to these people.

02:09:46.700 --> 02:09:49.320
It was completely destroyed my faith

02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:50.440
in government and everything.

02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.680
And I had one question posed to me by a conservative

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:53.720
that used to come on my stream and chat with me.

02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:55.840
And he said, and then he asked me,

02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:59.560
can you think of any popular opinion

02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:01.120
that the American public has

02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:02.560
that the government is unresponsive to?

02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:04.440
Is there some big piece of legislation or policy

02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:08.000
or whatever that people want that the government isn't doing?

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
When he asked me that,

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.960
I couldn't think of a single good answer.

02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:12.040
And I'm like, oh, geez.

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:13.000
This is a good hint.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.340
There's drugs.

02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:16.080
There's not, and that's the thing.

02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:17.720
Legalization of drugs, hold on.

02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:18.680
Yeah, go for it.

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:20.160
Oh shoot, you're doing the Joe Rogan thing.

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:21.600
You're pushing back because I brought up weed.

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:22.420
Go ahead.

02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:24.000
I'm sorry.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.600
I have become meme.

02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:30.920
I don't even, I don't want to interrupt your book

02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:32.360
because there's memes upon memes upon memes

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:33.760
I can go with here.

02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:37.200
No, because people bring up, okay, there's no issues.

02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:38.520
There's no issues that the government

02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:40.920
is not representing of the public.

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:41.760
So here's the issue.

02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:42.720
So somebody will bring up like,

02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:44.600
well, what about the legalization of drugs?

02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:47.000
Okay, the first issue people have is one,

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.640
they look at national polling.

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.960
Very few things are decided on a national level.

02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:52.800
So that's the first huge mistake.

02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:55.860
Arguably a lot of BLM made mistakes in this arena

02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:56.700
where they're saying like,

02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:58.760
why isn't the government doing anything about policing?

02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:00.080
Federal government can't do anything about policing.

02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:00.920
That's going to be your,

02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:01.740
sometimes not even your state government,

02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:03.080
sometimes your local city government.

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:05.160
The people that like elect like your chief of police,

02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:06.080
your police commissioner,

02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:08.280
that's coming from your mayor, right?

02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:09.920
So you've got people looking one,

02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:11.360
at the wrong parts of the government

02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:12.800
to even figure out the solutions to the problem.

02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:15.620
Two, oftentimes for polling,

02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:18.400
the questions are vague enough that you can poll very high,

02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:20.000
but when you get into the weeds on things,

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.520
no pun intended, you start to realize like,

02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:24.560
oh shoot, this is more complicated than I thought.

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:25.960
I don't know the numbers in particular

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:27.800
for legalization of marijuana,

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.240
but this is what I'm going to guess is the case.

02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:32.400
If you poll and you say, should we legalize marijuana?

02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:36.300
That number might poll at like 65, 70%.

02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:37.140
But that's including people

02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:38.560
that are in favor of medical marijuana.

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:41.140
If you were to poll like, should we legalize,

02:11:41.140 --> 02:11:44.020
should we decriminalize recreational use of marijuana?

02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:46.200
That number might drop to like 52%.

02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:48.600
And then if you poll like, should we completely legalize,

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:49.440
not just decriminalize,

02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.240
but completely legalize recreational use of marijuana,

02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:53.040
that number might drop to like 40%.

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.160
There's like all these different ways

02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:55.280
you can pull around issues where people are like,

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.680
oh no, we broadly agree on this topic.

02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:59.040
But when you really figure out, well, do you,

02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:01.240
do we really agree or is it just like broad consensus

02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:02.480
around a thing that's never going to show up

02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:04.000
like in a piece of legislation?

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.980
A really good example, one example I do know is,

02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:07.240
socialized healthcare.

02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:08.080
I think if you poll,

02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:11.540
there was a time a few years ago where if you poll America,

02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:14.040
do you think every American citizen should have access

02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:15.840
to like free healthcare?

02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:19.440
I think that answer, that poll at like 74%, yes.

02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:20.600
But when you asked,

02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:23.020
should the government be the sole provider of healthcare,

02:12:23.020 --> 02:12:26.320
it dropped to like 26%, dropped 50 points.

02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:27.160
And you could see,

02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:29.060
it was both asking questions about single payer,

02:12:29.060 --> 02:12:30.680
but the way that it was asked was so different

02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:33.120
that even if you all, it looks like there's consensus,

02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:34.560
there's not nearly as much consensus

02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:36.700
as people think around certain ideas.

02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:37.540
Yeah, go.

02:12:37.540 --> 02:12:38.360
We're not getting any political.

02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:40.960
You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:44.600
That polls, the way you ask the polls really matters.

02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:45.440
When you ask,

02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:47.440
should the government be in charge of a thing,

02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:50.800
that also biases the answer, right?

02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:54.080
Because there's such a negative experience

02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:57.200
with government creating a .gov site that runs the thing.

02:12:57.200 --> 02:12:58.520
But sometimes.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:12:59.360
Sometimes.

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:00.480
I think if you dig in,

02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:02.640
if you have a one hour conversation

02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:05.200
with each individual citizen,

02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:07.080
I think you will understand that, yes,

02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:09.400
there is support for socialized medicine.

02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:10.520
Like it's not-

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.680
The argument has to be made though, yeah.

02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:14.080
What do you mean, the argument has to be made?

02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:15.560
Like if you just ask a conservative,

02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:16.640
like what about a single payer?

02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:17.580
They're gonna tell you no.

02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:19.320
You might be able to build up to an argument for it,

02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:20.720
but you're gonna have to make the case for it.

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:23.320
No, but I thought we were talking about

02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:26.440
the feeling deep inside your mind and heart.

02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.320
Does the government represent that?

02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.160
Oh.

02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:34.160
So it's not like some shallow surface layer public opinion.

02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:36.960
Does the government effectively represent

02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.800
what the people want?

02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:41.960
Not a shallow survey, but deeply what they want.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:43.360
I'm not actually that familiar

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:45.120
with the debates over healthcare,

02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:47.680
but let's maybe look at an easier one.

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:49.240
Maybe you'll say it's harder.

02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:50.440
War.

02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:51.960
War is a really good example

02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:53.360
where the government was very responsive,

02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.060
I think, to the people.

02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:55.900
You think so.

02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:58.400
So Iraq, Afghanistan,

02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:01.960
the government didn't manipulate public opinion.

02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:03.440
There is an argument to be made

02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:06.160
that they did in terms of like WMD and everything,

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.880
but after 9-11,

02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:09.480
were you in the United States after 9-11?

02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:10.680
After 9-11.

02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:12.680
That seems accusatory.

02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:13.880
Where were you in 9-11?

02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:16.400
Oh, just checking, okay.

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:17.560
All right, cool.

02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:20.280
I have evidence and witnesses.

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:21.120
No, okay, all right.

02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:22.840
Well, I'm very defensive right now.

02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:23.800
That's very strange.

02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:26.320
Look into it, Alex Jones.

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:27.560
I think after 9-11,

02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:30.520
we could have gone to war with any country in the world.

02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:31.600
We were ready,

02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:33.960
because all of America was like, oh my God,

02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.200
and they pointed to Iraq,

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:37.840
and the reasons for the WMDs was kind of dumb,

02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:40.000
but I don't think we even needed WMDs to go to Iraq.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.080
We could have just said,

02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:43.880
Saddam Hussein was giving medical aid to Taliban,

02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:45.160
Al-Qaeda, Iraq, let's go,

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:46.640
and we would have gone for it.

02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:50.160
But post-Iraq, Iraq was for a while popular,

02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:52.080
and then became obviously deeply unpopular,

02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:53.280
Iraq and Afghanistan.

02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:54.760
And I think you could see that influence

02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:56.640
other foreign policy that the United States had.

02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:59.400
For instance, we opted more towards drone warfare

02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:01.840
than troops on the ground for places like Yemen.

02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:04.160
We opted more towards kind of like sending money and help

02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:06.640
instead of boots on the ground for places like Syria.

02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:08.800
And I think that a lot of that was kind of in response

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:11.360
to how unpopular the Iraq stuff had became.

02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:13.200
And when you looked at a lot of elections afterwards,

02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:14.440
even for Obama,

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:16.360
like one of the defining characteristics

02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.400
of a lot of campaigns were like,

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.040
I'm gonna close Guantanamo Bay,

02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:20.520
I'm gonna get us out of foreign wars,

02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:21.360
even up to Trump,

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:22.560
I'm going into,

02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:24.160
I'm not gonna stop doing all this weird stuff

02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:25.040
in the Middle East.

02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:27.080
But they didn't still withdraw from Afghanistan.

02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:27.920
They didn't withdraw,

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:29.400
but they definitely like tapered off

02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:31.120
and weren't like as aggressively pushing

02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:31.960
those types of conflicts,

02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:33.040
because they knew it was unpopular.

02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:36.480
But I think if you also consider perfect information

02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:38.400
or good information,

02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:40.120
if you ask a lot of people,

02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:44.720
are you okay spending this amount of money

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.040
for this purpose?

02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:48.440
So the military conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan,

02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.320
I think almost from the very beginning,

02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:51.520
they would say no.

02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:52.360
After 9-11?

02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:54.720
I feel like maybe like a few days after 9-11,

02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:56.960
like what was- I remember Freedom Prize.

02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:57.800
We were so mad at-

02:15:57.800 --> 02:15:59.840
Well, there's some memes and so on, yes.

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:03.000
But the nature of the public support for the war,

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:06.680
was there public support in 2003,

02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:09.000
which is when the invasion happened?

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.320
I feel like initially there was a lot.

02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:11.160
I remember seeing it on,

02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:12.560
but then I also lived in a Republican household

02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:14.160
and I was not very like media savvy at that time.

02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:15.000
So my parents were-

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.320
And I don't know if the nature of that public support

02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:19.440
had to do with WMDs or with 9-11.

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.280
Because the weird-

02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:21.720
If it came about WMDs.

02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:23.080
But I wonder what is the,

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.400
if you were to poll people and let's say hypothetically,

02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.360
there was above 50% support for the war,

02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:31.720
what would be the nature of that support?

02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:34.480
And to what degrees the government

02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:37.280
actually representing the will of the people

02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:41.040
versus some complex mechanism

02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:43.120
like the military industrial complex

02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.720
is manipulating the narrative

02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:47.280
that's controlling public opinion.

02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:51.440
And then there's the media that gets a lot of attention

02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:54.840
by being divided and how they're shaping the narrative

02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:56.960
through the mechanism of division.

02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:58.240
So what-

02:16:58.240 --> 02:16:59.960
There's a lot of complicated things out there.

02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:02.080
It's not just like the people and then the government.

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:03.440
And that's, yeah, for sure.

02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:05.600
I agree that there are gonna be different elements at play.

02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:10.440
And how much of those elements that lead us astray

02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:12.720
can be attributed to the largeness

02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:16.720
of the different systems and the different institutions

02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:21.240
like the media institutions and government,

02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:23.720
the institutions that have a monopoly on violence,

02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:24.840
let's put it this way,

02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:26.960
which is one way to define government.

02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:28.880
Sure, it's complicated.

02:17:28.880 --> 02:17:31.000
There's definitely gonna be different institutions at play.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.640
But I think that like,

02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:34.680
all I would say is like in reference to my original point,

02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:37.360
when there becomes like broad consensus around a thing,

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:38.800
I think the government will usually follow.

02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:39.640
It's not gonna fight.

02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:42.000
It's gonna follow more often than not.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.440
But I think that a lot of times,

02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:45.520
I think Americans think that there's more consensus

02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:48.120
around certain issues than there actually are.

02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:51.400
So like a really good example, we're on that war point too.

02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:55.520
What caused like the lowest dip in Biden's approval rating?

02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:56.920
I'm pretty sure it was right after we pulled out

02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:00.560
of Afghanistan, which I think if I would have asked people

02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:02.640
like a year before, like, let's assume

02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:04.840
that we could pull out of Afghanistan.

02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:06.640
The government's probably gonna collapse after we leave

02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:08.080
because they just don't have the will to fight.

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:08.920
They don't have the support.

02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:10.280
They don't, whatever, it's just not gonna work.

02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:12.160
But like no Americans are gonna die.

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:13.000
It might be a couple of other people,

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:13.840
but like no Americans are gonna die.

02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:14.680
We're gonna get out of Afghanistan.

02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:15.520
Would you support that?

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.520
I think broadly speaking,

02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:19.960
I think like more than 60 or 70% of Americans are like,

02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:21.240
yeah, that would be fine.

02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:22.760
But then when it actually plays on TV,

02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:24.240
when we see the people hanging onto the planes,

02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:26.080
when we see like helicopter embassies,

02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:27.440
some of the courts and politicians,

02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:29.200
well now it's like, oh my God, this was horrible.

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.240
And it was so botched.

02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:31.640
It could have gone so much better.

02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:32.680
It's like, well, could it have gone better?

02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:34.040
Like maybe, maybe not.

02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:36.440
But I mean, it seems like you can have consensus

02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:37.520
around a certain opinion,

02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:39.520
but the way that things play out

02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:41.000
and the way that people actually feel,

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.160
it's actually way, way, way more complicated.

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:46.360
And there's not usually this broad consensus opinion.

02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:47.240
All right, yeah, go ahead.

02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:48.240
I'd like to believe that.

02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:52.040
I mean, just to lay my cards on the table,

02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:58.840
I have faith in the power of effective government.

02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:04.800
I just have a lot of concern about what happens

02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:07.560
as institutions grow in size.

02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:08.400
For sure.

02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:09.440
And I just have a lot of worry

02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:12.160
about the natural corrupting influence

02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:15.680
on the individuals and on the system as a whole,

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.800
like the boys club nature of it.

02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:19.440
I don't know, there must be a better term.

02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:22.440
But basically they agree to the game

02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:23.480
and they play the game

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:27.960
and there's a generational aspect, momentum to the game.

02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:30.280
And they more and more stop being responsive

02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:32.840
to the people that they represent.

02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:35.080
I just feel like there is that mechanism.

02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:37.720
And I think the nice thing,

02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:40.320
democracy, elections are resistance

02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:41.960
to that natural human mechanism.

02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:44.240
Also the balances of power

02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:46.040
is a resistance to that mechanism.

02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:48.240
In some ways, the media that reveals

02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:49.840
the bullshit of politicians

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:52.320
is also a resistance to that mechanism.

02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:54.800
It's hard to be full of shit as a politician

02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:56.600
because people will try to catch you on it.

02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:01.000
So there's a honesty method there that keeps you honest.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.520
It's to some degree, but it still feels like,

02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:10.440
it still feels like politicians are gonna politician.

02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:12.040
Yeah, they definitely play their games.

02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:13.320
That is true.

02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:15.680
But there's probably always gonna be that meta narrative

02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.520
over like governance that just develops

02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:20.880
as like you have to form relationships and play games

02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:22.960
till they get legislation passed and everything.

02:20:22.960 --> 02:20:24.880
The only reason why I don't like it

02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:26.360
when people attack institutions

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.960
is because one, institutions are incredibly important,

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:30.560
arguably paramount, no, they are,

02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:32.040
to keeping society running.

02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:34.440
And two, I think sometimes when we shift the blame

02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:36.240
onto institutions too much,

02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:38.560
I think that we lose sight of what the real problems are.

02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:40.880
So for instance, in the United States today,

02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:42.520
people might be very critical of the government

02:20:42.520 --> 02:20:44.040
not getting much done,

02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:45.760
but then everybody turns their eyes to the government

02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:47.000
for being ineffective.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:48.440
But what I would argue is I would say

02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:51.080
the government is actually incredibly effective

02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:53.200
and it's showcasing the will of the American people

02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:54.160
really well right now,

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:56.480
which is we are historically more divided

02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:57.880
than we have ever been.

02:20:57.880 --> 02:20:59.400
And if I were to just look at the people

02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:02.000
and I were to say we have a historic divide

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.240
that is getting like rapidly blown apart

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:06.240
by things like the internet and the media, right?

02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:07.080
If that exists,

02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:08.760
well, what would I expect that government to look like?

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:09.600
I wouldn't expect that government

02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:10.680
to be governing very effective.

02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:12.360
I would expect that government to show

02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:14.480
that legitimate divide in people.

02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:15.800
Do you think that divide,

02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:18.200
we have a perception of a large divide

02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:20.000
between left and right.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.280
Do you think that's a real divide that's in this country?

02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:23.160
Narrow the language.

02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:25.440
What do you mean by real divide?

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:28.440
Do you think there is that divide in ideology?

02:21:28.440 --> 02:21:29.520
That there's a large number of people

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:30.960
that believe a certain set of policies

02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:32.960
and the different set of policies?

02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:35.640
Or is it just the perception on Twitter?

02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.680
No, I think there is a large divide in terms of belief.

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:39.680
I don't think there's very much divide between any people

02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:40.880
in terms of like what they,

02:21:40.880 --> 02:21:43.160
like on the most fundamental levels want

02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:44.520
in terms of like human beings.

02:21:44.520 --> 02:21:46.840
But in terms of like Democrat versus Republican right now,

02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:48.480
I think there is a huge divide

02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:50.480
in terms of the direction they wanna see the country go

02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:51.880
and what they believe really

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:53.520
and what they even believe is reality, right?

02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:55.920
Unfortunately, that's who we've gotten to.

02:21:55.920 --> 02:21:57.400
Can I just speak about the mechanism

02:21:57.400 --> 02:21:59.000
of the left and right here,

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.800
maybe on the mimetic rivalry aspect.

02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:04.880
Is there some aspect to the left on which you're a part of

02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:09.200
that attacks their own for ideological impurity

02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:10.560
more than the right does?

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.760
Is it the bigotry of small differences?

02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:17.240
There's a concept where when you're near somebody

02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:18.640
who is very slightly different than you,

02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:19.600
you wanna destroy,

02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:21.760
but when you're with somebody that's way different than you,

02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:23.520
you don't.

02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:24.480
I think the left does it,

02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:25.600
but I think the right does it too.

02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:27.200
I didn't realize it until I started dipping more

02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:28.240
into conservative communities,

02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:29.400
but oh my God,

02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:30.680
the people from the Daily Wire

02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:31.800
and the people from Turning Point

02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:33.680
and the America First,

02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:36.120
all these different groups of people hate each other

02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:37.360
and they fight each other so much.

02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:39.520
They hire and fire sometimes employees,

02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:41.720
they talk smack about each other.

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:42.920
I think there's a lot of political division

02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:43.760
between both sides.

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:45.840
I think that the left just kind of gets highlighted more

02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:46.760
because it's like the internet

02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:47.920
and a lot of the internet spaces

02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:48.960
have a lot of left-leaning people.

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:50.640
So you see like the crazy communist

02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:52.080
and the crazy progressives

02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:53.840
and the crazy center-left liberals

02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:54.960
and the crazy blah, blah, blah.

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:56.240
Whereas like a lot of the right-leaning people

02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:58.160
have kind of been pushed off of the main areas

02:22:58.160 --> 02:22:59.520
of the internet now.

02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:00.360
Interesting.

02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:04.000
My sense was that it's hard to exist on the center-left,

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.640
but maybe because I just don't have the full spectrum view

02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:08.600
of the political divide.

02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:10.600
It felt like center-left is a difficult position

02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:11.440
to occupy currently.

02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:12.800
Yeah, I would definitely say so, yeah.

02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:15.400
I don't know if it's that difficult to be center-right.

02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:17.160
It's very difficult to be center-right.

02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:19.440
I think actually maybe even more difficult

02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:21.160
because a center-right person might be somebody

02:23:21.160 --> 02:23:24.040
who's like conservative, but not a fan of Trump.

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:25.920
And you're like over.

02:23:25.920 --> 02:23:27.240
Like looking like Liz Cheney, right?

02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:28.760
You've had politicians that are just like,

02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:30.560
they didn't back the Trump stuff and now they're gone.

02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:32.000
Or you might be like center-right,

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.880
but like you don't think the election was stolen.

02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:36.400
And now you're like half the Republican party's looking at

02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:38.360
you like you're crazy, you know.

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:39.440
That's true, that's true.

02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:42.920
I think there's a Ben Shapiro I'm talking with.

02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:46.360
I think he publicly spoke against Trump, right?

02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:47.200
He did initially,

02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:48.320
but I felt like he softened his language

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:49.760
upon him pretty significantly, but.

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:51.920
So there's a significant pressure to kinda

02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:53.880
couch out to a certain kind of messaging.

02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:55.960
Which the whole Republican party is feeling right now.

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:57.160
Geez, that two years from now,

02:23:57.160 --> 02:23:59.280
that election is gonna be insane.

02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:01.360
It's just hard, okay, so to generalize,

02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:02.960
it's hard to be in the center, it feels like.

02:24:02.960 --> 02:24:03.800
For sure.

02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:06.840
To center and then like do like a random walk

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.440
among the policies around that.

02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:12.120
I don't know what that mechanism is.

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:15.880
I mean, it makes people like me not feel good

02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:17.360
being in the center.

02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.480
It seems like people are just not nice

02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:21.000
to people in the center.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.960
Like the public, the Twitter machine is not nice

02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:27.760
to the people who are open-minded in the center.

02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:29.440
Is that, is there some truth to that?

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:30.560
Two reasons for that.

02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:32.080
One is because I think a lot of people

02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:33.440
that market themselves as center

02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:35.400
are legitimately spineless cowards

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:36.800
and deserve to be called out.

02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:37.920
Like.

02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:40.680
I've never killed a man, but today might be my first.

02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:42.200
Oh no.

02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:43.040
There are.

02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:43.880
And I'll take over, like I told you,

02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:45.480
I'll take over your stream.

02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:46.640
With the AI, yeah, we'll see.

02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:48.960
Is that guy gonna be streaming in the background?

02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:49.800
Hey fellas.

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:53.160
Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

02:24:53.160 --> 02:24:54.000
Gotcha.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.120
Lots of gotchas, lots of gotchas.

02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:55.960
Okay, gotcha.

02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:56.800
Okay, gotcha.

02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:00.360
And decrease the, which already is a pretty low level

02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:02.680
of emotion, just decrease it completely.

02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:05.920
When people are screaming at you and accusing stuff,

02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:07.280
just remain calm.

02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:08.120
Absolutely.

02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:08.940
Emotionless.

02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:10.000
The gaslighter strategy.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:10.840
Yeah.

02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:12.360
Okay, so what we're talking about.

02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:14.560
So I don't.

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:16.680
I don't even, I don't ever identify a center anything

02:25:16.680 --> 02:25:18.120
because it's got such a bad reputation.

02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:18.960
Because so.

02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:22.000
Fuck that, I stand center with a spine.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.280
It's called being open-minded.

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:25.120
And it's not center, left, and right.

02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:26.240
Those are just labels.

02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:28.200
Here's a really good quote my mom said to me

02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:29.040
when I was really young.

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:31.600
She said, Stevie, don't ever let your mind be so open

02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:32.920
that your brain falls out.

02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:34.760
And that's what I find that a lot of center people do.

02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:36.920
That's not what she told me last night.

02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:38.040
Why are you like this?

02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:40.760
I'm sorry.

02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:42.560
Okay, I'm glad I can bring that.

02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:43.760
I'm glad you feel like this is a safe space.

02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:45.360
Like I said, people are not judgmental.

02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:46.640
If you wanna talk about fucking my mom,

02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:48.040
you know what, you're totally within your rights.

02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:48.880
I didn't say that.

02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:49.720
You said that.

02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:50.540
I didn't say that.

02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:51.380
I support that.

02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:52.220
She's a beautiful woman.

02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:53.560
Her husband probably wouldn't be too happy about it,

02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:54.520
but you know.

02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:56.480
I didn't say there's any sexual relations.

02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:59.080
It was just that having a conversation with her.

02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:00.120
You projected that.

02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:02.000
That says more by you than me.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.440
Anyway, go ahead about spineless center.

02:26:04.440 --> 02:26:05.700
Spineless center.

02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:09.040
There is some aspect to that which is like amorphous.

02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:13.080
To me, center means you think freely

02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:16.840
about each individual policy without being stuck to a camp.

02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:18.220
Yeah, but a lot of people don't do that.

02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:19.280
They'll call themselves centrist,

02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:21.000
but then they're anti-establishment,

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.280
essentially, on everything.

02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:25.480
I don't know your position on the vaccines or anything,

02:26:25.480 --> 02:26:27.320
but I've met a lot of free and open thinkers

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:29.600
who are like, you know what, I'm open to everything

02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:30.880
and it's an experimental vaccine

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:33.120
and I'm gonna eat hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin

02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:35.520
because that's what the institutions are telling me not to take

02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:37.920
and I think Fauci got too much money from that company

02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:39.520
and these are, but I'm an open thinker.

02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:41.160
And what open thinker becomes-

02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:42.000
I'm at MIT.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.640
What do you think my position of vaccines is exactly?

02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:46.200
I hear a lot of crazy things from a lot of people.

02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:48.560
You might be from MIT, but I know you're from the internet.

02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:50.920
People from the internet are weird and crazy, so.

02:26:51.880 --> 02:26:52.720
Well, I-

02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:53.640
Who knows?

02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:55.000
I don't like arrogance

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.460
and I have criticized scientists during COVID,

02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:01.120
a lot of people, but scientists included are having arrogance.

02:27:01.120 --> 02:27:01.960
Which is fair.

02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:02.800
But-

02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:05.400
And I think there's a lot of good criticism to be made

02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:08.500
of different scientific and medical establishments

02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:10.440
over a lot of stuff,

02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:12.520
but nobody can make those good criticisms

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:15.440
because they're too obsessed over just trying

02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:17.320
to have the anti-establishment answer

02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:19.400
and that is what is upsetting me the most.

02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:22.120
I think there are good conversations to be had

02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:24.240
about a lot of stuff related to

02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:26.080
how we handle the coronavirus.

02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.220
Were lockdowns effective?

02:27:27.220 --> 02:27:30.880
Was there enough data to support the huge measures we took?

02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:33.000
Why didn't we have the option to show

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.400
I was infected a month ago?

02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:35.680
Why do I need to be vaccinated?

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:37.280
Why wasn't that option ever a thing in the United States?

02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:38.420
I don't think it was.

02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:41.100
There are really good questions to be asked there,

02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:42.780
but all the people asking the questions

02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:44.340
are also trying to tell you that ivermectin

02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:46.620
and monoclonal antibodies are the way to go for everything

02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:47.860
and the vaccine is evil

02:27:47.860 --> 02:27:49.780
and they're just gonna turn you gay like the frogs.

02:27:49.780 --> 02:27:52.500
It's like, Jesus, there's like no place

02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:54.240
to reasonably criticize from

02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:55.940
because all of the people that are criticizing

02:27:55.940 --> 02:27:57.380
aren't doing it with an open mind

02:27:57.380 --> 02:27:59.820
or they're not reading studies or doing anything.

02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:01.060
They're saying like, I do my own research,

02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:02.980
which means they listen to whatever the last guy

02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:04.860
on Joe Rogan said and now they're parroting that opinion

02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:06.700
100%. Easy now, easy now, bro.

02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:08.220
The last guy on Joe Rogan, not Joe Rogan, okay?

02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:10.620
That Robert Malone guy on Joe Rogan got me real fired up.

02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:11.460
That's one guest.

02:28:11.460 --> 02:28:14.300
People see him as like the father of mRNA technology.

02:28:14.300 --> 02:28:16.060
He published one paper, okay?

02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:17.180
What do you mean people?

02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:19.060
Which people think that?

02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:21.380
Joe Rogan fans, I run into these people.

02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:22.600
I start arguing with people and they start citing me,

02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:23.440
well, what about-

02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:26.540
I'm a Joe Rogan fan and I appreciate the vaccine.

02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:28.700
That's good, I'm glad you do, but there's definitely-

02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.660
Sorry, but you said there's a type, what's the type?

02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:33.080
What's the type of Joe Rogan fan?

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.860
Anti-establishment.

02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:36.420
I think that's not Joe Rogan.

02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:37.940
That's a general public discourse.

02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:40.700
There's a default anti-establishment

02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:42.420
on the right and the left.

02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:45.180
That's the default easy thing to go to.

02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:47.020
I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely a certain type

02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:48.500
of anti-establishment though.

02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:50.740
I could guess the Joe Rogan fan.

02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:53.060
If I were to do general population versus Joe Rogan fan,

02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:55.660
who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine?

02:28:55.660 --> 02:28:57.340
Do you have data on this?

02:28:57.340 --> 02:28:58.580
Or are you just guessing?

02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:00.020
Just guessing.

02:29:00.020 --> 02:29:01.700
I think you are actually judging.

02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:02.540
I am, yeah.

02:29:02.540 --> 02:29:03.380
I think you're judging.

02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:04.940
Because I think you're also,

02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:08.020
the beautiful thing about podcasting,

02:29:08.020 --> 02:29:09.540
this could be similar to streaming,

02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:13.020
is there's a large number of people that just listen.

02:29:13.020 --> 02:29:15.580
Like what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan?

02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:16.620
I don't think you just listen.

02:29:16.620 --> 02:29:19.380
I think people listen and absorb the information.

02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:21.660
I would say that the Joe Rogan fan base

02:29:21.660 --> 02:29:24.620
is as divided in the vaccine as the general public.

02:29:24.620 --> 02:29:25.460
Gotcha.

02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:26.780
Man, I'm going to look for polling data on that.

02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:28.740
I'm sure somebody's got to have done it out there, but-

02:29:28.740 --> 02:29:31.060
No, but you're basically revealing the fact

02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:31.900
they have no data.

02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:33.220
You're using your own judgment.

02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:34.420
For sure.

02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:35.900
Based on how he's had conversations

02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:37.740
about his experience with the coronavirus,

02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:39.780
and then based on the guests that have come on

02:29:39.780 --> 02:29:40.980
that have talked and echoed a lot

02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:42.220
of like anti-vax talking points

02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:43.700
and been completely unchallenged,

02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:45.260
and then based on statements he's made

02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:46.980
about like myocarditis and the vaccine

02:29:46.980 --> 02:29:47.940
and everything as well, yeah.

02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:50.860
So it's the level of challenge or not that he's doing.

02:29:50.860 --> 02:29:52.540
Well, yeah, and then what his true positions are,

02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:54.300
and then the types of guests he typically chooses

02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:56.100
to bring on to talk about the vaccines, yeah.

02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:58.300
Okay, but that represents somehow

02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:02.740
a deep anti-establishment feeling versus just the vaccine.

02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:06.020
I mean, I've seen the vaccine and other things being,

02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:07.660
I think that broke people.

02:30:07.660 --> 02:30:08.820
I think all the coronavirus,

02:30:08.820 --> 02:30:12.100
that whole one or two years broke a lot of people.

02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:15.740
There's a lot of emotion and emotion quickly solidified

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:18.340
into an opinion that almost had nothing to do

02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:22.460
with like thinking through and updating your knowledge

02:30:22.460 --> 02:30:24.460
and so on, you just made up your mind.

02:30:24.460 --> 02:30:25.660
Yeah, but I think a lot of it comes

02:30:25.660 --> 02:30:26.900
from that anti-establishment place.

02:30:26.900 --> 02:30:30.340
Like the vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment.

02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:33.060
There was a huge private company

02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:36.180
backed by a huge public government

02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:40.060
and there's Fauci and there's Biden and there's Pfizer

02:30:40.060 --> 02:30:42.460
and there's all these countries locking us up in our homes,

02:30:42.460 --> 02:30:43.380
telling us to do a thing.

02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:47.260
Like the vaccine was like the ultimate like submission tool

02:30:47.260 --> 02:30:48.780
to like show you that the government owns you.

02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:51.220
Not only do you have to get injected once, it's a series

02:30:51.220 --> 02:30:52.500
and then you gotta get boosters

02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:54.020
and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb

02:30:54.020 --> 02:30:55.820
and that's the control.

02:30:55.820 --> 02:30:56.740
I feel like that vaccine

02:30:56.740 --> 02:30:58.420
became like the ultimate rallying cry between like,

02:30:58.420 --> 02:30:59.900
do you support, are you a sellout

02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:01.740
that is gonna believe whatever the government tells

02:31:01.740 --> 02:31:03.740
the sheep to take or are you gonna be like the guy

02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:06.580
that stands against the crowd and gets fired from his job

02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:07.740
and pulls his kids from school

02:31:07.740 --> 02:31:09.940
because they're not gonna let the evil Fauci medicine,

02:31:09.940 --> 02:31:11.140
jab them in the arm.

02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:13.100
And the funny thing is the crowd that stands

02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:16.620
against the institution is not larger

02:31:16.620 --> 02:31:18.140
than the crowd of sheep.

02:31:18.140 --> 02:31:19.740
There's like one sheep standing there.

02:31:19.740 --> 02:31:21.620
Sure, yeah, or it feels that way sometimes.

02:31:21.620 --> 02:31:23.260
One vaccinated sheep.

02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:26.060
Well, okay, what's the defense of institutions?

02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:28.060
How do you regain the trust of institutions?

02:31:28.060 --> 02:31:31.180
Like, first of all, do you think that there's ways

02:31:31.180 --> 02:31:34.780
in which WHO, CDC failed?

02:31:34.780 --> 02:31:37.580
And do you think there's criticism towards Pfizer

02:31:37.580 --> 02:31:40.060
and the big pharma companies that deserve it?

02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:42.500
Damn, it's the pharma companies, I'm not sure.

02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:45.620
For CDC and WHO, so here's a criticism that I have

02:31:45.620 --> 02:31:48.060
of all of academia and I feel it stronger

02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:49.580
and stronger every day.

02:31:49.580 --> 02:31:52.700
I don't think it's enough to be a researcher

02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:54.420
or to be correct about issues.

02:31:54.460 --> 02:31:58.580
Academia needs to increase its ability to communicate.

02:31:59.420 --> 02:32:03.420
It is just an unbelievable, unmitigated failure

02:32:03.420 --> 02:32:06.100
that academics are unwilling to wade

02:32:06.100 --> 02:32:09.220
into the complicated topics that exist today

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:10.820
because other people are, you know?

02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:12.300
First you call me spineless

02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:14.300
and then you call me a bad communicator.

02:32:14.300 --> 02:32:15.380
But no, look, you're here, you're doing it.

02:32:15.380 --> 02:32:17.380
So you get props for me, okay, good job.

02:32:17.380 --> 02:32:18.220
That motherfucker.

02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:19.540
But there are like so many, but I'm sure you've,

02:32:19.540 --> 02:32:24.540
I'm sure that you must have heard another fellow academic,

02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:27.700
a fellow colleague express some amount of frustration

02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:30.340
about like in their specific discipline,

02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:31.460
they know something to be true

02:32:31.460 --> 02:32:33.300
and they know that like a lot of the messaging

02:32:33.300 --> 02:32:35.140
is like wrong or bad in the public about it,

02:32:35.140 --> 02:32:36.500
but they're never gonna step out and say anything

02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:38.420
because either one, they're very measured

02:32:38.420 --> 02:32:39.260
and careful with their tech,

02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:40.420
which they feel is incompatible

02:32:40.420 --> 02:32:41.540
with what people wanna hear,

02:32:41.540 --> 02:32:44.220
or two, they're really worried that they might be incorrect.

02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:45.900
So they're gonna be cautious while everybody else

02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:47.380
is going out and like hardcore in their range.

02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:49.340
And they also don't have the support of institutions

02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:50.580
for them to go out on a limb.

02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:51.420
Yeah, that too.

02:32:51.420 --> 02:32:52.340
So like to take risks.

02:32:52.340 --> 02:32:55.900
For example, I've heard that with lab leak theory.

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:58.140
I've had a lot of biologists, virologists, friends

02:32:58.140 --> 02:33:01.500
that are like, yeah, it's obviously leaked from a lab.

02:33:01.500 --> 02:33:02.940
Okay. Like early on.

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:04.780
Oh, maybe, okay, we can fight over this one,

02:33:04.780 --> 02:33:05.620
but sorry, go ahead.

02:33:05.620 --> 02:33:06.460
No, no, keep talking.

02:33:06.460 --> 02:33:07.620
We can fight over this.

02:33:07.620 --> 02:33:11.140
Well, like they, okay, I should sort of backstep

02:33:11.140 --> 02:33:13.700
and say like, that's like, you talk about shooting a shit,

02:33:13.700 --> 02:33:15.940
you haven't really investigated, but it's your gut.

02:33:15.940 --> 02:33:17.660
Like this doesn't make any sense.

02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:18.980
They would never say that publicly.

02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:23.340
Mostly because you're saying like what they would all say

02:33:23.340 --> 02:33:24.980
is like, we want to see data.

02:33:24.980 --> 02:33:26.660
Yeah, which would be good, which is fine.

02:33:26.660 --> 02:33:27.860
So they're going with like,

02:33:27.860 --> 02:33:30.180
like this is too many coincidence in the same place.

02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:32.900
That's the logic, but they don't wanna say anything

02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:33.740
because there's no data.

02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:34.940
You need to have evidence.

02:33:34.940 --> 02:33:36.660
You need to have actual evidence to say one way

02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:37.500
or the other.

02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:40.180
There's that, but there's also just like you said,

02:33:40.180 --> 02:33:42.900
I mean, effective communication.

02:33:42.900 --> 02:33:44.420
You're a fan of Sean Carroll.

02:33:44.420 --> 02:33:45.580
Oh, yes.

02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:47.900
He's like one of the only people in this whole planet

02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:48.980
that I like besides you.

02:33:48.980 --> 02:33:50.460
I love Sean Carroll.

02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:53.660
Anytime Sean Carroll is brought up as evidenced,

02:33:53.660 --> 02:33:56.100
there's a smile that comes over your face.

02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:56.940
I love it.

02:33:56.940 --> 02:33:58.780
Of like joy, of like a little kid

02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:00.300
thinking about Santa Claus.

02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:01.860
Okay, I love Sean Carroll too.

02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:03.740
Just to be clear, I love Sean Carroll

02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:07.140
because I hate this divide between like,

02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:09.540
you're either STEM or you're like philosophy, arts

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:10.380
and all that other stuff.

02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:11.220
And the two worlds can never cross.

02:34:11.220 --> 02:34:13.180
And I love that it was so good at physics,

02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:14.700
but like explores and pays attention

02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:16.540
to all of the like sociological stuff too.

02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:18.500
It's so rare to find that quality in a person.

02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:21.100
He's legit one of the really, really, really specialized,

02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:22.380
but you don't have to be a Sean Carroll.

02:34:22.380 --> 02:34:24.740
You can be just a little better at educating.

02:34:24.740 --> 02:34:27.980
Another person in the medical and the health space

02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:29.700
is somebody named Andrew Huberman,

02:34:29.700 --> 02:34:31.820
a friend of mine from Stanford.

02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:33.940
He's an incredible educator.

02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:36.220
There's the kind of process in science

02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:38.700
they usually call like review or survey papers

02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:42.140
where you basically summarize all that's going on,

02:34:42.140 --> 02:34:44.300
integrate it and like draw wisdom from it

02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:47.100
and also project like, where's the discipline headed?

02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:49.900
And Andrew does that basically on all these subcomponents

02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:52.540
of the different stuff going on in neuroscience

02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:54.460
and biology, neurobiology, all that.

02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:58.140
He's able to, he does a podcast called Huberman Lab

02:34:58.140 --> 02:35:01.140
where he just summarizes all and is able to explain like,

02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:04.260
what does that actually mean for your life

02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:07.020
in terms of protocols of how to make your life better?

02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:09.340
I feel like people should be able to do that more and more,

02:35:09.340 --> 02:35:14.140
but with virology and oh boy, that's a tricky one.

02:35:14.140 --> 02:35:15.580
That's a really tricky one.

02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:18.060
I wish that people could have honest conversations.

02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:19.420
Like I attack a lot of people

02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:20.900
that do the lab leak theory stuff,

02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:22.580
but truly we should be able

02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:24.260
to have that conversation publicly.

02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:25.460
It just, it always feels like the people

02:35:25.460 --> 02:35:26.420
that are having the conversation

02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:28.020
don't ever really want to have the conversation.

02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:28.860
They're not being honest.

02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:32.020
Like I'm a guy that like does his own research

02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:34.340
and it's so boring reading studies

02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:36.220
and a lot of it I can only do abstracts

02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:38.380
and like it's so much work,

02:35:38.380 --> 02:35:40.260
but I'll never ever say that about myself.

02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:41.380
I'm a guy that does his own research

02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:43.340
because every time I hear somebody say that,

02:35:43.340 --> 02:35:44.460
they don't do any research.

02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:45.580
When they say they do their own research,

02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:46.940
what they mean is they've seen one podcast

02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:47.780
and their opinion on it is completely-

02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:48.940
What podcast is that?

02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:50.260
Definitely not mine because it was mine.

02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:52.740
I wouldn't be criticizing anything they say.

02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:54.220
But yeah, so like lab leak is another one

02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:56.140
where it's like, well, how do you know it's lab leak?

02:35:56.140 --> 02:35:57.620
How do I know it's lab leak?

02:35:57.620 --> 02:35:59.940
Because Fauci lied and Hunter Biden-

02:35:59.940 --> 02:36:00.780
Right.

02:36:00.780 --> 02:36:01.600
And it's like, okay, come on,

02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:02.440
you haven't engaged with it at all.

02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:03.980
There's really interesting research

02:36:03.980 --> 02:36:05.580
that shows there's a really strong study

02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:08.220
that shows that there's like a high degree of certainty

02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:10.100
that it came from the wet markets.

02:36:10.100 --> 02:36:11.860
Very, very high degree of certainty.

02:36:12.060 --> 02:36:13.300
There was an article that came out recently

02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:16.300
where it's like Senate concludes that virus actually came

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:19.180
from the Wuhan Virology Lab or whatever.

02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:20.820
And that whole article, if you actually read it,

02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:21.980
it never says that in the article.

02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:24.500
I don't know why they tweeted it with that headline.

02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:26.500
But yeah, to back up, I'm sorry.

02:36:26.500 --> 02:36:27.940
I think we should have good-

02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:28.900
You should be sorry.

02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:30.980
Yeah, I'm not sorry, actually.

02:36:30.980 --> 02:36:32.380
I get to ramble here, okay?

02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:33.420
I'm here for a long time.

02:36:33.420 --> 02:36:35.340
I rescind my apology, okay?

02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:36.860
I actually rescind my apology.

02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:39.340
We should be able to have challenging conversations

02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:40.380
about things, but you gotta, man,

02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:41.460
be well-read on both sides.

02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:43.340
I do my own research,

02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:44.860
so I don't believe anything that Fauci says.

02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:45.940
Like, come on, dude.

02:36:45.940 --> 02:36:46.780
You can do better than that.

02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:48.020
Not you personally, but-

02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:49.580
Gotcha.

02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:50.660
How does that feel?

02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:55.740
So for people who don't know, that's the catchphrase.

02:36:55.740 --> 02:36:56.580
Gotcha.

02:36:56.580 --> 02:36:58.940
Through all tragedy and triumph,

02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:01.380
through all the rollercoaster of life,

02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:03.180
your response to it is gotcha.

02:37:05.180 --> 02:37:06.900
Well, actually, let me jump to that

02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:10.940
before I continue with political discourse.

02:37:11.900 --> 02:37:15.620
Psychologically, you are in a lot of heated debates,

02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:18.420
and you're usually super calm under fire until you're not.

02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:20.620
Sometimes you lose your temper completely.

02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:21.900
Very rarely, but-

02:37:21.900 --> 02:37:23.620
That's like your opinion, man.

02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:25.020
Let me ask you about your psychology.

02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:27.500
What are psychologically your strengths and weaknesses

02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.140
that you're self-aware about?

02:37:29.140 --> 02:37:30.460
I think I'm very non-judgmental,

02:37:30.460 --> 02:37:32.660
so I can entertain a lot of different thoughts

02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:34.780
without agreeing with them or condoning them.

02:37:34.780 --> 02:37:37.580
I think that's a really big benefit to me.

02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:40.980
For whatever reason, I seem to be pretty calm

02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:43.460
in dealing with annoying people.

02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:45.140
It's why I got promoted at the casino so fast.

02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:46.900
I could deal with drunks or whatever.

02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:48.380
It just didn't affect me that much.

02:37:48.380 --> 02:37:51.100
What percent of the population is annoying?

02:37:51.100 --> 02:37:53.740
Depends on how you're engaging with them.

02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:55.580
Most people aren't really annoying, ever.

02:37:55.580 --> 02:37:58.020
But if you're doing political debate,

02:37:58.020 --> 02:37:59.180
what percentage is annoying?

02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:01.340
I guess it depends on who I'm debating and what the topic is.

02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:03.420
I guess I'm trying to point out the fact

02:38:03.420 --> 02:38:08.020
that sometimes you can say that reveals something about you

02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:10.260
if you think a large percent of people are annoying.

02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:12.900
I would say working graveyard shift when alcohol is involved,

02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:15.540
that percentage of people goes very, very, very high.

02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:16.820
Or to be more fair, actually.

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:18.500
It's not a high percentage, truly.

02:38:18.500 --> 02:38:19.780
But if you're a server,

02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:22.460
one bad customer can ruin the rest of your shift.

02:38:22.460 --> 02:38:24.540
You only need one or two people acting in that manner

02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:26.220
to just totally throw you off.

02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:29.340
And you're able to, at least these days,

02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:32.820
not allow that one customer to throw you off, quote unquote.

02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:34.220
Yeah, I'm very much like a...

02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:36.420
I noticed this especially after having a son.

02:38:36.420 --> 02:38:39.180
There's something about six-year-old kids or whatever

02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:40.700
where it's like, if they get mad,

02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:41.940
they're never gonna be mad for that long.

02:38:41.940 --> 02:38:42.780
They'll move on.

02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:43.620
That's my mentality.

02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:44.820
I'm a six-year-old kid.

02:38:44.820 --> 02:38:45.660
I might be mad about something,

02:38:45.660 --> 02:38:47.580
but I'll get over it in 30 minutes or an hour.

02:38:48.580 --> 02:38:50.180
I'm pretty good about not carrying that through.

02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:52.740
It's very rare that I'll hold a grudge against anybody

02:38:52.740 --> 02:38:54.660
or be angry about something

02:38:54.660 --> 02:38:56.780
or really disaffected by something over the long term.

02:38:56.780 --> 02:38:58.420
That almost never happens to me.

02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:01.180
What are your weaknesses psychologically, would you say?

02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:04.380
I still have a problem with projecting.

02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:05.220
I think we all probably do,

02:39:05.220 --> 02:39:06.820
but my mind onto others is like,

02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:08.580
if I understand this and I've said this,

02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:11.020
you should understand it, and if you're not, you're dumb.

02:39:11.020 --> 02:39:12.500
That's an issue that I...

02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:14.620
I still have that where I project too much.

02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:16.700
What about holding grudges and stuff like that?

02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:17.540
I never hold grudges.

02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:19.460
I'm the least grudgy person ever.

02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:20.500
It's kind of a meme on my community

02:39:20.500 --> 02:39:22.940
because anybody can always come back

02:39:22.940 --> 02:39:24.100
as long as they're acting different.

02:39:24.100 --> 02:39:24.940
What about the...

02:39:24.940 --> 02:39:27.180
As long as they're acting different.

02:39:27.180 --> 02:39:29.020
As long as they're acting different.

02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:30.460
The reason why I say that is because...

02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:31.980
So for instance, nobody likes this,

02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:33.780
but I have a strong stance on apologies

02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:34.620
and that I hate them.

02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:35.620
I don't ever wanna hear an apology.

02:39:35.620 --> 02:39:36.900
I don't care about them ever.

02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:38.060
They don't mean anything to me.

02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:39.380
If you did something bad,

02:39:39.380 --> 02:39:40.900
as long as you've fixed the behavior

02:39:40.900 --> 02:39:41.820
and you're not doing that thing,

02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:42.980
then we're generally chill.

02:39:42.980 --> 02:39:43.820
There's been a lot of people

02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:44.860
that have been involved in weird stuff with me,

02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:46.700
but then they go off to do their thing

02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:48.220
and they come back and it's like, okay, cool.

02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:49.580
As long as you don't do it again, we're fine.

02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:50.420
It's all good.

02:39:51.580 --> 02:39:53.020
I'm sorry you feel that way.

02:39:54.220 --> 02:39:55.420
It's not your fault, Steven.

02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:56.340
It's not your fault.

02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:57.620
Okay, gotcha.

02:39:57.620 --> 02:40:00.180
You've said plenty of negative stuff,

02:40:00.180 --> 02:40:03.180
positive stuff and negative stuff about Hassan.

02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:04.340
This is my podcast.

02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:07.020
I get to force you to say positive things.

02:40:07.020 --> 02:40:08.020
What do you love?

02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:08.860
Oh, no.

02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:10.260
I'm all about love.

02:40:10.260 --> 02:40:12.180
Let's go back to grilling me on the R-word stuff.

02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:13.540
You're gonna make me compliment Hassan?

02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:15.340
This is gonna be a harder conversation than that.

02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:16.180
All right.

02:40:18.020 --> 02:40:19.940
We're gonna get you to feel emotions.

02:40:19.940 --> 02:40:21.780
Okay.

02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:22.620
For people who don't know,

02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:25.100
he's another popular political streamer.

02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:27.860
I think you had, as the kids call it,

02:40:27.860 --> 02:40:30.180
a bridge burning over Bernie Sanders.

02:40:30.180 --> 02:40:31.020
I don't know.

02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:32.660
My research is very limited on this,

02:40:32.660 --> 02:40:36.500
but what do you respect and love most about Hassan?

02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:38.820
He puts in a lot of work.

02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:40.260
When he was growing his stream

02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:42.420
from 2,000 concurrent viewers to 15,000,

02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:46.860
he was streaming 12 hours a day, every single day.

02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:47.700
So that was admirable.

02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:49.100
He did a lot of work.

02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:51.100
He does seem to be pretty good at networking

02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:53.260
and socializing and making the correct friends

02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:54.980
and connections to continue to build his business.

02:40:54.980 --> 02:40:56.900
What about him as a political thinker?

02:40:56.900 --> 02:40:59.820
I know you don't think highly of him in that regard,

02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:01.380
but I think that's unfair.

02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:02.700
Oh, man.

02:41:02.700 --> 02:41:04.900
I honestly wanna push back on that because...

02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:05.860
Okay.

02:41:05.860 --> 02:41:08.780
I have zero respect for him as a political thinker.

02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:10.660
Or there's not gonna be almost anything.

02:41:10.660 --> 02:41:13.940
Oh, I will say I admire the fact that

02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:17.260
through no actual capability or ability of his own,

02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:19.420
he manages to wind up at some of the correct answers

02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:20.980
just because he's towing the lines.

02:41:20.980 --> 02:41:22.300
Good job for him on that.

02:41:22.300 --> 02:41:23.500
He's got a lot of correct opinions,

02:41:23.500 --> 02:41:25.180
just he has no idea why.

02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:26.260
I think that's undeserved.

02:41:26.260 --> 02:41:27.820
I think that's too harsh, man.

02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:29.460
The reason I bring that up is I feel like

02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:33.060
there is a deep grudge in there somehow.

02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:36.660
So you're the father, and also since you're so old,

02:41:36.660 --> 02:41:41.220
the grandfather of the political debate on stream,

02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:43.300
on live stream political debater.

02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:48.300
So there could be some grudge about that split that happened

02:41:48.460 --> 02:41:50.940
or not enough credit given or all that kind of stuff.

02:41:50.940 --> 02:41:53.980
I just think he's somebody that has

02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:57.220
a left-leaning ideology that's different than yours.

02:41:57.220 --> 02:41:58.740
He was a Bernie supporter, right?

02:41:58.740 --> 02:42:00.620
And I guess you were not.

02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:02.980
Can you explain to me where the division is?

02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:05.540
He exemplifies everything that I absolutely hate

02:42:05.540 --> 02:42:07.100
about politics. Which is what?

02:42:07.100 --> 02:42:11.820
Which is shallow engagement, heavily ideologically driven.

02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:13.500
And you're not ideologically different.

02:42:13.500 --> 02:42:15.660
Absolutely not, free of ideology.

02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:16.620
That's what we're talking about,

02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:19.260
like the free thinker in the real meaning of that word.

02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:20.900
Yeah, so the way, let me qualify that.

02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:21.900
Issue by issue thinking.

02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:24.220
Let me qualify what I mean when I say that.

02:42:24.220 --> 02:42:26.220
I spent a lot of time, unfortunate time,

02:42:26.220 --> 02:42:28.100
delving into the boring world of philosophy.

02:42:28.100 --> 02:42:30.020
I spent a lot of time thinking about

02:42:30.020 --> 02:42:31.700
what are my ethical positions?

02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:34.860
How do I feel about myself, the people around me

02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:36.340
and how that relates to the world around me?

02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:38.060
And then from all of these positions,

02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:39.100
I think you might've used the phrase

02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:40.900
first principles earlier.

02:42:40.900 --> 02:42:42.700
From these kind of like first principles,

02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:45.220
out of that is where all of my political positions

02:42:45.220 --> 02:42:47.340
are built out of, like full stop.

02:42:47.340 --> 02:42:48.820
So if you ask me a question like,

02:42:48.820 --> 02:42:50.980
how do you feel about like the right to own a firearm

02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:52.380
or how do you feel about social healthcare?

02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:54.180
Like we can walk through,

02:42:54.180 --> 02:42:55.140
well, this is how I feel about it

02:42:55.140 --> 02:42:56.700
as like a thing from the government.

02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:58.380
This is where the government gets its power.

02:42:58.380 --> 02:43:00.180
This is ethically how groups of people

02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:01.260
are supposed to function.

02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:02.980
This is morally how we relate to each other.

02:43:02.980 --> 02:43:04.180
And personally, this is how I feel like.

02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:05.220
Like I'll be able to do every single

02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:06.460
political belief back there.

02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:07.860
It's not like I'm telling you,

02:43:07.860 --> 02:43:10.180
like if I were to ask Hassan,

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:11.660
what do you feel about this political topic?

02:43:11.660 --> 02:43:13.700
He's gonna tell me what progressives are supposed to say.

02:43:13.700 --> 02:43:14.540
I don't know what he thinks about it.

02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:15.380
I don't know if he thinks about it.

02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:16.460
Don't you think that's a cynical take?

02:43:16.460 --> 02:43:19.700
Why is he, just because his views coincide

02:43:19.700 --> 02:43:21.580
with the mainstream narrative,

02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:24.220
mainstream viewpoints of progressive thinkers.

02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:27.500
I mean, why does that mean he's not thinking?

02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:29.180
Because his engagement with every subject

02:43:29.180 --> 02:43:32.100
is incredibly shallow, 100% predictable.

02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:33.980
Like I could write like a,

02:43:33.980 --> 02:43:35.460
I could probably program a script

02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:37.300
to like give you every single potential answer

02:43:37.300 --> 02:43:39.300
you could have to any single question you could give him.

02:43:39.300 --> 02:43:41.300
Again, I think that's a pretty cynical take.

02:43:41.300 --> 02:43:42.740
Okay, it could be the case that his brain

02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:44.740
perfectly aligns with every single mainstream progressive.

02:43:44.740 --> 02:43:47.100
I don't know if you know it is perfectly aligned.

02:43:47.100 --> 02:43:48.940
Because I think you're just taking a very select,

02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:51.060
just like streamers do of each other,

02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:55.980
a very select slice that represents the perfect alignment.

02:43:55.980 --> 02:43:58.380
As opposed to looking at a person struggling with ideas

02:43:58.380 --> 02:43:59.660
and thinking through ideas,

02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:02.460
and then giving them a pass like a lot of people,

02:44:02.460 --> 02:44:06.020
like I give you a pass on just the fact

02:44:06.020 --> 02:44:09.220
that you say a lot of crazy shit on stream for drama.

02:44:09.220 --> 02:44:10.060
Like, which is-

02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:11.140
I don't say things for drama.

02:44:11.140 --> 02:44:13.140
It might be dramatic, but.

02:44:13.140 --> 02:44:17.060
I mean, you've evolved as a fish evolves legs.

02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:20.580
You've evolved a mechanism which creates controversy.

02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:21.420
Sure.

02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:24.100
That you could say it's not intention, but it happens.

02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:24.980
I think- Okay, sure.

02:44:24.980 --> 02:44:27.420
The extremists kind of learn that kind of thing.

02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:30.460
And so I'm sure Hassan does the same kind of stuff.

02:44:30.460 --> 02:44:31.860
And so like underneath it,

02:44:31.860 --> 02:44:33.220
there's still a thinking being

02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:36.420
that's contending with political ideas.

02:44:36.420 --> 02:44:37.260
You don't think so?

02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:38.660
Okay, he does a really good job at hiding it.

02:44:38.660 --> 02:44:41.220
There are other political figures that I really don't like

02:44:41.220 --> 02:44:42.340
that I wouldn't say the same thing about.

02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:44.100
So like, I don't know if you have Vosh written in there.

02:44:44.100 --> 02:44:45.620
I'm like, okay, that's the person that-

02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:46.460
Who's Vosh?

02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:48.020
He also split out of my community

02:44:48.020 --> 02:44:48.860
and grew up to something.

02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:50.740
And now he hates me and he's an anti-fan community.

02:44:50.740 --> 02:44:51.580
And they all hate me.

02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:53.140
Okay, tell me something you love about what-

02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:54.620
I can tell you a lot of things about Vosh.

02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:56.020
I think Vosh legitimately thinks

02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:58.060
through a lot of his political positions.

02:44:58.060 --> 02:45:00.940
I admire or did admire that he has like his own

02:45:00.940 --> 02:45:02.060
like positions he would take.

02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:04.460
Sometimes contrary to people further left than him.

02:45:04.460 --> 02:45:06.660
He's got some positions that don't fit his ideology

02:45:06.660 --> 02:45:07.500
kind of at all.

02:45:07.500 --> 02:45:08.660
Like he's his own independent thinker.

02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:10.220
Rhetorically, he's very effective.

02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:12.340
He was willing to sit down and do research

02:45:12.340 --> 02:45:14.380
for like his debates and everything.

02:45:14.380 --> 02:45:15.860
He would spend a lot of time practicing

02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:17.300
like his rhetorical effectiveness

02:45:17.300 --> 02:45:19.180
and navigating conversations.

02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:20.580
He intentionally and purposefully built

02:45:20.580 --> 02:45:23.260
like a community that exemplified his values.

02:45:23.260 --> 02:45:24.100
Yeah, I've got a lot.

02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:26.980
We are completely split and hate each other now,

02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:27.820
but like I have a lot-

02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:28.860
Why, why, why hate?

02:45:28.860 --> 02:45:31.540
First of all, hate is a strong, why the hate?

02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:33.420
Okay, I don't hate him, but he hates me

02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:35.220
because we had a couple of really big debates.

02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:36.060
What happened?

02:45:36.060 --> 02:45:37.460
Well, one had to do with whether or not

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:39.020
you should live your values.

02:45:39.020 --> 02:45:40.740
And can you give me the story

02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:42.380
that's a charitable interpretation?

02:45:42.380 --> 02:45:43.620
I always give charitable interpretation.

02:45:43.620 --> 02:45:44.460
You don't, you don't.

02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:45.660
I absolutely do.

02:45:45.660 --> 02:45:46.500
You don't.

02:45:46.500 --> 02:45:47.660
Wait, Nate, one time it happened.

02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:49.540
Five minutes ago, you talking about Hassan.

02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:50.700
Everything I said about Hassan is true.

02:45:50.700 --> 02:45:52.140
There is no steel man there, okay?

02:45:52.140 --> 02:45:53.980
That's not charitable.

02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:55.700
I'm sorry.

02:45:55.700 --> 02:45:56.540
If you can prove me wrong,

02:45:56.540 --> 02:45:57.900
I would love for you to do it, okay?

02:45:57.900 --> 02:45:59.580
I'm using my gut instinct.

02:45:59.580 --> 02:46:02.340
Usually when somebody feels strongly

02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:04.220
about another person in that way,

02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:06.740
it's not coming from a place of data and reason.

02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:09.180
It's coming from a place of emotion.

02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:11.620
It's coming from a place of resentment

02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:13.180
and grudge and all that kind of stuff.

02:46:13.180 --> 02:46:14.180
Yeah, I can understand that.

02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:15.620
There's emotions deep in there.

02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:17.420
So the gacha is hiding.

02:46:17.420 --> 02:46:21.260
The gacha is a surface of an iceberg

02:46:21.260 --> 02:46:22.940
and there's a deep ocean underneath

02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:24.500
that you yourself have not explored.

02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:26.340
I disagree, but I understand why you think that.

02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:27.780
And LAV is actually a doorway.

02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:30.260
The young LAV is a doorway

02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:31.860
for you to explore the depths of the.

02:46:31.860 --> 02:46:34.500
Get into that ocean to find my fish, my pre-evolved form.

02:46:34.500 --> 02:46:35.460
Yeah.

02:46:35.460 --> 02:46:36.820
I understand why you think the way you do

02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:38.300
and you should, you shouldn't believe me

02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:39.540
and I understand that

02:46:39.540 --> 02:46:40.820
because if somebody told me the same thing,

02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:42.380
I'd think you probably just really don't like this person

02:46:42.380 --> 02:46:43.340
for a reason or two.

02:46:43.340 --> 02:46:45.100
I understand why you think that way, okay?

02:46:45.100 --> 02:46:46.100
The reality is though,

02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:47.980
for any political person that I disagree with,

02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:49.180
I can give them a fair shake.

02:46:49.180 --> 02:46:50.100
It's one of the few things

02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:52.340
I think I do exceedingly well on my stream.

02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:53.180
Even with Hassan,

02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:54.700
there's been drama that he's been involved in

02:46:54.700 --> 02:46:56.820
and I've like very, when I'm involved in drama,

02:46:56.820 --> 02:46:58.020
he'll always throw me under the bus,

02:46:58.020 --> 02:46:59.140
but when he's involved in stuff,

02:46:59.140 --> 02:46:59.980
I'll always say like,

02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:01.180
oh, like I think Hassan was right here

02:47:01.180 --> 02:47:03.340
or I think that he meant this.

02:47:03.340 --> 02:47:04.940
There was a, there was a thing that came up

02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:06.380
once we're on a live stream field.

02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:08.820
He was getting roasted because he referred to somebody.

02:47:08.820 --> 02:47:10.780
He used the expression shitskin

02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:13.300
to refer to somebody's like the way they looked.

02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:15.820
And I have only ever heard that

02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:18.340
in the context of 4chan people talking about like Indians

02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:19.580
or like black people.

02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:21.100
Like it's a racial thing.

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:23.300
But I could tell the context

02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:24.660
and everything that he was saying.

02:47:24.660 --> 02:47:25.900
He was insulting some guy.

02:47:25.900 --> 02:47:27.220
I think it was kind of like incel virgin.

02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:28.980
He was going for like acne skin.

02:47:28.980 --> 02:47:30.340
I think that's what he meant when he said it.

02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:31.180
And there were a whole bunch of people

02:47:31.180 --> 02:47:32.020
that were insulting.

02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:33.100
It's like, oh my God, did he just say racist term?

02:47:33.100 --> 02:47:34.300
And I was like, no, I don't think he was racist.

02:47:34.300 --> 02:47:35.820
I think he was like, he was just reaching for words

02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:37.460
and that's what came out.

02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:39.780
So like, that's an example of me being charitable.

02:47:39.780 --> 02:47:41.940
Okay, but didn't you criticize him for something?

02:47:41.940 --> 02:47:43.820
I was trying to, I like Googled,

02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:45.140
why the hell you guys split up?

02:47:45.140 --> 02:47:47.300
Cause I thought your friends, you should be like.

02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:49.220
He split up over Kamala Harris video, but go ahead.

02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:50.060
What were you?

02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:52.860
Is that the, so I feel like you criticized them

02:47:52.860 --> 02:47:55.620
over something and I'm okay.

02:47:55.620 --> 02:47:56.740
This is very vague memory,

02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:58.700
but you criticize them over something.

02:47:58.700 --> 02:48:01.020
And I felt that criticism wasn't charitable.

02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:02.260
Was it Pete Buttigieg stuff?

02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:04.020
Yeah, Pete Buttigieg, yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:06.100
Yeah, so I've said this a million times,

02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:07.380
but there's no amount of context

02:48:07.380 --> 02:48:09.500
or no amount of nuances is ever acceptable to people.

02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:12.020
I don't think Hassan is homophobic,

02:48:12.020 --> 02:48:14.620
but I think the comments made about Pete Buttigieg

02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:15.460
were really homophobic.

02:48:15.460 --> 02:48:16.420
That's what he said.

02:48:16.420 --> 02:48:19.140
Yeah, and there were a lot of people making a lot

02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:21.660
of comments that made me really uncomfortable

02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:23.340
about Pete Buttigieg.

02:48:23.340 --> 02:48:24.900
That was insane to me.

02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:27.580
Spurred by the comments of Hassan?

02:48:27.580 --> 02:48:30.340
No, but it was an environment of progressives.

02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:32.500
All the progressives were attacking Pete.

02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:36.300
And I felt like his gayness became like the subject.

02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:38.940
Yeah, but why throw Hassan under the bus for that?

02:48:38.940 --> 02:48:40.820
Cause he was jumping along with all of those types

02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:42.180
of like insults.

02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:44.020
You don't think you've done the same kind of stuff?

02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:45.580
If I do call me on it and I'll probably say

02:48:45.580 --> 02:48:46.420
I shouldn't have done that.

02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:47.780
That's what the R word was about.

02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:49.300
That's a good call out.

02:48:49.300 --> 02:48:50.340
No, but like your friend,

02:48:50.340 --> 02:48:52.700
like you should privately tell them, right?

02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:54.740
Well, no, by then we were sworn enemies.

02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:55.860
So that wasn't the reason.

02:48:55.860 --> 02:48:56.700
No, no, no.

02:48:56.700 --> 02:48:57.540
It was over a Kamala Harris video.

02:48:57.540 --> 02:48:59.100
Sworn enemies.

02:48:59.100 --> 02:48:59.940
He hates me.

02:48:59.940 --> 02:49:00.780
What am I supposed to?

02:49:00.780 --> 02:49:02.060
Listen, for all of these people,

02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:03.580
I will accept them back into my life

02:49:03.580 --> 02:49:04.980
if they ever want to come back in at any point in time.

02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:06.100
But usually they're the ones that-

02:49:06.100 --> 02:49:08.740
If they correct themselves, right?

02:49:08.740 --> 02:49:10.540
No, I'm not expecting anybody to.

02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:11.860
So here's the deal with Vashj and Hassan.

02:49:11.860 --> 02:49:14.420
These are like the three, we're the three guys online.

02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:16.220
None of us will talk to each other.

02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:17.660
Hassan, because he won't give clout to anybody

02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:20.380
and Vashj because he thinks I'm bad faith.

02:49:20.380 --> 02:49:21.540
And then neither of them will talk to me

02:49:21.540 --> 02:49:22.740
because they both hate me.

02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:25.100
You guys should go like on a camping trip together.

02:49:25.100 --> 02:49:27.340
It's like broke back mountain, but three way.

02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:29.420
And just like rejoin, refine-

02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:30.260
Yeah, that could be a thing.

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:31.180
Refine and appreciate for each other.

02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:32.820
Honestly, just from the internet perspective,

02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:35.300
for me as just stepping into this world,

02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:40.420
there's some aspect to which you have a responsibility.

02:49:40.420 --> 02:49:41.260
I hate that word.

02:49:41.260 --> 02:49:42.100
Good word.

02:49:42.100 --> 02:49:44.140
You have an opportunity.

02:49:44.140 --> 02:49:46.820
I wish you guys would kind of be the beacon

02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:49.460
of like forgiveness and friendship

02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:50.660
and like camaraderie and that kind of stuff.

02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:51.500
Yeah, I agree.

02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:53.260
And even if we disagree, it would be really good content

02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:54.100
for us to argue with each other.

02:49:54.100 --> 02:49:56.220
Yeah, like shit talk, like friends shit talk.

02:49:56.220 --> 02:49:58.100
Versus not, like the fact that you guys

02:49:58.100 --> 02:50:00.780
don't talk to each other.

02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:03.500
Like I would love for you to shit talk publicly

02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:04.820
with the camaraderie always there.

02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:07.380
Like there's love in the beginning, love in the end,

02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:09.180
but you beat the shit out of each other in the middle.

02:50:09.180 --> 02:50:10.860
And that's what live streaming is for,

02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:11.900
the political discourses.

02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:14.180
That's great political discourse.

02:50:14.220 --> 02:50:18.540
Versus I think what underlies it is some jealousy and so on.

02:50:18.540 --> 02:50:20.780
With this, you get this many followers.

02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:23.380
I just wanna make sure you're clear to your audience.

02:50:23.380 --> 02:50:26.220
Everybody has to your audience.

02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:28.780
I'm sure you have flaws and I'm just not,

02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:29.620
in this dynamic.

02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:30.780
Hard to find, you know, because I'm.

02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:33.580
Your only flaw is you're too modest, yeah.

02:50:33.580 --> 02:50:34.940
So why did you guys split up?

02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:36.580
Because I would love it, honestly,

02:50:36.580 --> 02:50:38.660
just let me just put that idea out there

02:50:38.660 --> 02:50:41.380
for you guys to make up and some.

02:50:41.380 --> 02:50:42.220
Yeah, it's out there.

02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:43.300
Of course, as everybody talks,

02:50:43.300 --> 02:50:45.580
me, Vash and Hasan, it's crazy that like the three largest

02:50:45.580 --> 02:50:48.660
like political debate, left leaning people online,

02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:51.620
like can't do any type of content or collaboration at all.

02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:52.700
It's so stupid.

02:50:52.700 --> 02:50:53.540
Yeah, strange.

02:50:53.540 --> 02:50:54.820
What was the reason you guys split up?

02:50:54.820 --> 02:50:55.980
The Kamala Harris?

02:50:55.980 --> 02:50:58.340
So Hasan's entry into kind of like

02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:01.900
the Twitch political debate world was in I think 2018,

02:51:01.900 --> 02:51:03.980
I think he did a debate with Charlie Kirk

02:51:03.980 --> 02:51:06.980
and he reached out to me to kind of like review that debate

02:51:06.980 --> 02:51:08.940
to like go on, to go over it on stream.

02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:10.340
And he came on, we went over it

02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:11.900
and then we kind of a friendship developed.

02:51:11.900 --> 02:51:12.860
We hung out in real life.

02:51:12.860 --> 02:51:14.780
I think when I came to LA, I think I slept on his couch.

02:51:14.780 --> 02:51:15.620
We played with his dog.

02:51:15.620 --> 02:51:17.100
We were like kind of friends.

02:51:18.100 --> 02:51:22.020
And as time went on and then he was a little bit more,

02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:25.180
he was farther left than he led on.

02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:27.500
So like I was a social Democrat, he was a social Democrat.

02:51:27.500 --> 02:51:29.580
But back in those days, like 2018,

02:51:29.580 --> 02:51:30.900
when people said they were a social Democrat,

02:51:30.900 --> 02:51:31.780
they really met socialists,

02:51:31.780 --> 02:51:32.820
but they just didn't wanna say it.

02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:33.900
So he was farther left than me.

02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:36.300
And we had a lot of deep divides

02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:38.460
in our approach to politics.

02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:41.020
Whereas like I was very much like a first principles,

02:51:41.020 --> 02:51:42.420
this is my whole political position.

02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:44.220
And he was very much kind of like a,

02:51:44.220 --> 02:51:46.220
this is like the political ideology I'm involved in.

02:51:46.220 --> 02:51:47.220
And this is kind of like the field

02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:48.700
that I kind of like navigate in.

02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:50.420
So there were a couple instances

02:51:50.420 --> 02:51:53.140
where these divides would be laid very bare.

02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:56.740
One was when, it was either him or the young Turks.

02:51:56.740 --> 02:51:58.460
I think it was him.

02:51:58.460 --> 02:52:00.140
There was a shooting in a neighborhood

02:52:00.140 --> 02:52:03.660
where very young black child gets killed by a white shooter.

02:52:03.660 --> 02:52:06.060
And they did a video about like hate crimes

02:52:06.060 --> 02:52:08.420
and how hate crimes are on the rise between races

02:52:08.420 --> 02:52:10.020
and white people are evil and blah, blah, blah.

02:52:10.020 --> 02:52:11.220
Not that, but like white people

02:52:11.220 --> 02:52:12.820
committing hate crimes against black people.

02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:14.820
And I remember saying to him, I was like,

02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:17.620
hey, we don't have all the data yet for this.

02:52:17.620 --> 02:52:20.660
It feels really bad to make videos about this beforehand

02:52:20.660 --> 02:52:23.700
cause it's the same type of shit that happens at airports.

02:52:23.700 --> 02:52:24.740
Is there a thing going on?

02:52:24.740 --> 02:52:25.620
Was it a brown person?

02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:26.460
Are they Muslim?

02:52:26.460 --> 02:52:27.380
It's Islamic extremism.

02:52:27.380 --> 02:52:30.260
We see this played out so many times in recent history,

02:52:30.260 --> 02:52:32.140
probably not a good idea to jump to conclusions.

02:52:32.140 --> 02:52:33.500
And he's like, well, no, you don't understand.

02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:34.940
Like it's not that big a deal, whatever.

02:52:34.940 --> 02:52:37.260
And obviously as the story goes, tale as old as time,

02:52:37.260 --> 02:52:39.620
the data comes out, it was just an errant shot.

02:52:39.660 --> 02:52:40.820
There was like gang violence,

02:52:40.820 --> 02:52:42.500
shot goes out of nowhere, hits a kid in the car.

02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:43.420
It wasn't like a hate crime.

02:52:43.420 --> 02:52:44.540
The guy was trying to kill a kid.

02:52:44.540 --> 02:52:46.940
But yeah, we basically, we bump up against a few

02:52:46.940 --> 02:52:49.140
kind of political disagreements like this.

02:52:49.140 --> 02:52:51.300
And an annoying thing is happening in my community

02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:53.340
where Hasan is like the serious political figure

02:52:53.340 --> 02:52:54.460
cause he's from the Young Turks.

02:52:54.460 --> 02:52:56.820
And I'm just kind of like, I do politics, but I also game.

02:52:56.820 --> 02:52:59.260
And anytime I criticize Hasan, people like Destiny,

02:52:59.260 --> 02:53:00.260
you need to be more respectful.

02:53:00.260 --> 02:53:01.380
He does this full time.

02:53:01.380 --> 02:53:02.420
If you're going to bring criticisms,

02:53:02.420 --> 02:53:04.020
you need to be like really well read and researched

02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:06.180
because he's got a, you know, more serious, whatever.

02:53:06.180 --> 02:53:07.020
Which I thought was ridiculous.

02:53:07.020 --> 02:53:08.620
So by the way, if people don't know,

02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:11.420
he worked at the Young Turks, which is like

02:53:11.420 --> 02:53:13.100
the largest left-leaning YouTube channel probably,

02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:15.460
or at least at the time, yeah.

02:53:15.460 --> 02:53:18.380
So finally he did a video on,

02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:19.940
skip ahead to some more minor discriments.

02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:21.420
He does a video on Kamala Harris.

02:53:21.420 --> 02:53:22.900
He calls it Kaatmala Harris.

02:53:22.900 --> 02:53:24.660
And it's like seven or eight horrible things

02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:25.500
about Kamala Harris.

02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:27.260
And I'm like, okay, I know at least one or two

02:53:27.260 --> 02:53:28.540
of these things are not fully accurate.

02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:30.540
So I'm going to do all the research.

02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:31.540
I'm going to have all the sources

02:53:31.540 --> 02:53:32.940
and we're going to have a long conversation about it

02:53:32.940 --> 02:53:34.980
so that now when I provide criticism to him,

02:53:34.980 --> 02:53:37.100
it's not going to be like this horrible,

02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:39.260
like just me saying something flippantly or whatever.

02:53:39.260 --> 02:53:41.100
It's going to be like substantial criticism.

02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:45.980
So I was on a plane ride, JFK to Orlando, whatever,

02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:49.700
flying to Sweden to visit my wife and on the plane,

02:53:49.700 --> 02:53:51.500
I review all of the video, all the data,

02:53:51.500 --> 02:53:52.660
do all the research and I write everything.

02:53:52.660 --> 02:53:57.660
I'm just like, okay, I get to my wife's dad's house

02:53:57.740 --> 02:53:59.620
and I'm at the table.

02:53:59.620 --> 02:54:01.220
We're having a conversation like, hey,

02:54:01.220 --> 02:54:03.620
we should talk about the Kamala Harris stuff.

02:54:03.660 --> 02:54:04.940
And he's like, okay, well, let's do it.

02:54:04.940 --> 02:54:09.020
And we go over it and I'll leave to the audience

02:54:09.020 --> 02:54:10.100
to watch the video.

02:54:10.100 --> 02:54:10.940
Enough people have said this.

02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:12.140
I feel pretty confident saying this.

02:54:12.140 --> 02:54:13.940
I was pretty reasonable, pretty measured,

02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:15.060
pretty calm the whole time.

02:54:15.060 --> 02:54:17.220
And I think he started to get increasingly irritated

02:54:17.220 --> 02:54:20.220
that I was levying like more and more serious criticisms

02:54:20.220 --> 02:54:22.500
at like the quality of work that he did.

02:54:22.500 --> 02:54:24.300
Probably because he felt a little bit intimidated,

02:54:24.300 --> 02:54:26.480
I think by my willingness to like dive

02:54:26.480 --> 02:54:27.700
through political stuff.

02:54:27.700 --> 02:54:29.140
There'd been a couple of awkward blowups

02:54:29.140 --> 02:54:32.260
where like on, there was like a show called The Raj Royale

02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:34.460
where sometimes politics would come up

02:54:34.460 --> 02:54:36.300
and Hassan would kind of try to explain something.

02:54:36.300 --> 02:54:37.460
And there was another person one time

02:54:37.460 --> 02:54:38.300
on the show that made the joke.

02:54:38.300 --> 02:54:39.860
It was like, instead of Hassan taking 10 minutes

02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:41.180
to explain this, can Destiny just come here

02:54:41.180 --> 02:54:42.380
and explain it in 30 seconds?

02:54:42.380 --> 02:54:43.460
And he like exploded at that.

02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:46.060
He got so fucking mad at that.

02:54:46.060 --> 02:54:48.140
So yeah, I think that when I made that kind of call out

02:54:48.140 --> 02:54:50.020
or critique of him over the Kamala Harris stuff,

02:54:50.020 --> 02:54:51.980
he's probably feeling like increasingly irritated,

02:54:51.980 --> 02:54:52.980
threatened, agitated.

02:54:52.980 --> 02:54:56.020
And then that's kind of what began the huge split from horror.

02:54:56.020 --> 02:54:58.100
So you don't think you were a dick at all?

02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:00.020
I don't think so in that conversation.

02:55:00.020 --> 02:55:02.260
Especially given that like at that point,

02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:06.020
cause this is still 2018 or 20, this might be 2019.

02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:09.300
I'm still known at that point as being very aggressive

02:55:09.300 --> 02:55:11.260
towards conservatives or all writers.

02:55:11.260 --> 02:55:12.100
Oh, gotcha.

02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:13.980
Yeah, so, and with lefties is what I call them.

02:55:13.980 --> 02:55:15.700
I think I'm being like very gentle.

02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:17.220
Like my conversations start with conservatives,

02:55:17.220 --> 02:55:18.900
like you're a fucking idiot, you're so dumb.

02:55:18.900 --> 02:55:19.980
Like that's how I'm like doing.

02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:21.660
So like with him, I'm like, well, don't you think

02:55:21.660 --> 02:55:22.980
that like, this is like a little bit

02:55:22.980 --> 02:55:25.220
of like an inconsistent presentation of how like,

02:55:25.220 --> 02:55:26.060
I feel like it'd be nice.

02:55:26.060 --> 02:55:27.180
But I always leave to the audience

02:55:27.180 --> 02:55:29.940
so they can go and watch that Kamala Harris video

02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:31.660
or Destiny of the Sun if they think

02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:32.500
that I was being a dick at all.

02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:33.340
But a lot of people watching said

02:55:33.340 --> 02:55:34.180
I was being pretty gentle.

02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:37.340
Well, let me say, as a new fan of this space,

02:55:37.340 --> 02:55:41.100
I hope you guys make up and I hope you guys fight it out

02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:43.060
in the space of discourse and ideas.

02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:43.900
Me too.

02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:44.740
And also with empathy,

02:55:44.740 --> 02:55:47.020
understanding what the strength of the other person is,

02:55:47.020 --> 02:55:48.140
what their buttons are.

02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:51.260
And, you know, there's like an unspoken rule

02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:54.700
that you don't press the buttons that you need to,

02:55:54.700 --> 02:55:57.140
unless you're doing it mutually and it's fun

02:55:57.140 --> 02:55:58.900
cause you know, it's fun to piss each other off.

02:55:58.900 --> 02:56:01.020
So that's kind of like what friends do.

02:56:01.020 --> 02:56:03.140
You don't cross a certain line,

02:56:03.140 --> 02:56:05.420
but then other than that, you fight it out.

02:56:05.420 --> 02:56:06.860
Okay, let's step back.

02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:10.260
One other super interesting aspect of your worldview

02:56:10.260 --> 02:56:13.620
is you're a big supporter of Biden.

02:56:13.620 --> 02:56:15.620
Can you explain what you love about Biden?

02:56:15.620 --> 02:56:18.500
Do you love Biden more than Sean Carroll or less?

02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:22.660
Sean Carroll is just like in another world of admiration.

02:56:22.660 --> 02:56:24.980
I feel like I'm culturally appropriating you

02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:27.980
by saying gotcha now, but it's so convenient.

02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:28.820
That's an easy word.

02:56:28.820 --> 02:56:30.540
You just, I know we're on the same wavelength.

02:56:30.540 --> 02:56:31.740
Okay, we're synchronizing.

02:56:31.740 --> 02:56:32.580
That's good.

02:56:32.580 --> 02:56:33.700
I mean, it is really interesting

02:56:33.700 --> 02:56:35.420
because even the people that support Biden

02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:37.980
usually don't say they love sort of,

02:56:37.980 --> 02:56:39.740
they don't support it strongly, you know.

02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:41.980
Ideologically, philosophically,

02:56:41.980 --> 02:56:44.620
the reason why I like Biden is because he's really committed

02:56:44.620 --> 02:56:46.700
to this bringing the left and right together,

02:56:46.700 --> 02:56:49.420
which is something we so desperately need in the country.

02:56:49.420 --> 02:56:52.500
And his, you know, statements over and over again of like,

02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:55.020
I'm not the Democrat president or the Republican president.

02:56:55.020 --> 02:56:56.580
I'm the president of the United States.

02:56:56.580 --> 02:56:58.940
His desire to bring Republicans together

02:56:58.940 --> 02:57:01.500
to work on things like the infrastructure bill,

02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:03.620
that's so incredibly needed.

02:57:03.620 --> 02:57:06.540
And I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for him

02:57:06.540 --> 02:57:08.620
for trying to push through on that message.

02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:10.460
Do you think then it's unfortunate

02:57:10.460 --> 02:57:12.420
that he made that comment about MAGA?

02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:13.300
MAGA Republicans?

02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:15.180
Yeah, I mean, I forget what the comment was,

02:57:15.180 --> 02:57:18.460
but MAGA Republicans are not good people kind of thing.

02:57:18.460 --> 02:57:21.700
I watched the full video and he's right.

02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:24.460
There is this toxic aspect and it's hard to call out

02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:25.700
because they're always gonna spend like,

02:57:25.700 --> 02:57:26.900
oh, he hates our Republicans, he's not.

02:57:26.900 --> 02:57:27.740
If you watch the quote,

02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:31.020
he's very specifically calling out like this group of people

02:57:31.020 --> 02:57:33.140
that think that the election was fraudulent.

02:57:33.140 --> 02:57:35.660
Is it clear that's what he meant by?

02:57:35.660 --> 02:57:36.980
We can bring it up.

02:57:36.980 --> 02:57:37.820
All right, this is-

02:57:37.820 --> 02:57:39.260
Oh, no, uh-oh.

02:57:39.260 --> 02:57:40.260
But I remember watching it on our stream,

02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:41.380
it was like, if he said it, yeah, that's bad.

02:57:41.380 --> 02:57:43.940
You can probably like YouTube, MAGA Republicans, Biden.

02:57:43.940 --> 02:57:44.980
But like, it feels like it's pretty clear

02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:47.900
he's talking about the people that are like election denying.

02:57:47.900 --> 02:57:50.420
Too much of what's happening in our country today

02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:52.340
is not normal.

02:57:53.340 --> 02:57:56.580
Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans

02:57:56.580 --> 02:57:59.220
represent an extremism that threatens

02:57:59.220 --> 02:58:02.260
the very foundations of our Republic.

02:58:03.220 --> 02:58:05.380
Now, I wanna be very clear.

02:58:05.380 --> 02:58:06.220
Listen to this part.

02:58:06.220 --> 02:58:07.060
Very clear up front.

02:58:08.980 --> 02:58:11.780
Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans

02:58:11.780 --> 02:58:13.220
are MAGA Republicans.

02:58:14.260 --> 02:58:18.060
Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.

02:58:18.060 --> 02:58:20.660
I know, because I've been able to work

02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:22.620
with these mainstream Republicans.

02:58:23.500 --> 02:58:26.980
But there's no question that the Republican Party today

02:58:26.980 --> 02:58:30.300
is dominated, driven, and intimidated

02:58:30.300 --> 02:58:32.740
by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.

02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:36.620
And that is a threat to this country.

02:58:36.620 --> 02:58:37.580
I disagree with that, man.

02:58:37.580 --> 02:58:41.620
He didn't clearly say extremist ideology.

02:58:41.620 --> 02:58:44.140
He didn't say the people that dialed

02:58:44.140 --> 02:58:45.540
the validity of the election.

02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:47.020
I mean, that's Donald Trump.

02:58:47.020 --> 02:58:48.380
No, but there's-

02:58:48.380 --> 02:58:50.340
That's all the candidates that Donald Trump is supporting.

02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:51.740
What is it, like 40, 50?

02:58:51.740 --> 02:58:52.860
How many candidates right now

02:58:52.860 --> 02:58:55.100
that are MAGA candidates are election deniers?

02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:57.420
No, but there's 80 million

02:58:57.420 --> 02:58:59.580
or whatever people voted for Donald Trump.

02:58:59.580 --> 02:59:02.300
You could say that's the MAGA Republicans.

02:59:02.300 --> 02:59:06.340
So to me, it sounded like he was referring

02:59:06.340 --> 02:59:08.500
to not even the majority.

02:59:08.500 --> 02:59:12.820
I mean, that's one nice, helpful, clarifying statement.

02:59:12.820 --> 02:59:15.140
But it's basically there's the mainstream Republicans

02:59:15.140 --> 02:59:17.380
and then there's those that voted for Donald Trump.

02:59:17.380 --> 02:59:18.660
That's the way I heard it.

02:59:18.660 --> 02:59:19.500
Okay.

02:59:19.580 --> 02:59:21.420
Maybe you should have done a better job at clarifying,

02:59:21.420 --> 02:59:24.020
but I feel like there's like a clear,

02:59:24.020 --> 02:59:27.300
there is a huge problem with this group of Americans

02:59:27.300 --> 02:59:28.500
that think that like the election is stolen.

02:59:28.500 --> 02:59:29.340
I feel like that's what he's trying to call it.

02:59:29.340 --> 02:59:33.740
No matter if that's what he meant,

02:59:33.740 --> 02:59:37.060
even flirting with that line is not a person

02:59:37.060 --> 02:59:39.180
who's bringing people together.

02:59:39.180 --> 02:59:42.060
I feel like extending a hand to the like most,

02:59:42.060 --> 02:59:43.940
I've worked with Republicans in Congress,

02:59:43.940 --> 02:59:46.780
not even a majority of Republicans are like this.

02:59:46.780 --> 02:59:49.220
No, but why say not the majority of Republicans

02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:53.660
that like to say like we're one country.

02:59:53.660 --> 02:59:54.500
We believe the same thing.

02:59:54.500 --> 02:59:57.300
So like focus on the uniting part versus saying.

02:59:57.300 --> 02:59:58.140
He does before and after.

02:59:58.140 --> 02:59:59.220
That was 50 seconds, okay.

02:59:59.220 --> 03:00:00.780
But that you never,

03:00:00.780 --> 03:00:02.580
the point is you never say something like that.

03:00:02.580 --> 03:00:05.580
Listen, like that, you've spoken about the Bosnia speech,

03:00:05.580 --> 03:00:07.300
which is your favorite of his.

03:00:07.300 --> 03:00:09.220
I want back to it and listen to it.

03:00:09.220 --> 03:00:10.540
Before I move to that, just on this,

03:00:10.540 --> 03:00:12.380
it's really hard for him to call out

03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:13.860
that group of like election deniers,

03:00:13.860 --> 03:00:15.260
I think without it always feeling like.

03:00:15.260 --> 03:00:16.660
Well, why call them out?

03:00:16.660 --> 03:00:19.140
Because it's arguably one of the most destructive forces

03:00:20.060 --> 03:00:21.100
that exists in this country today.

03:00:21.100 --> 03:00:22.900
Did it destroy anything?

03:00:22.900 --> 03:00:24.300
They were trying to.

03:00:24.300 --> 03:00:25.940
Did it though?

03:00:25.940 --> 03:00:27.260
It didn't, did it?

03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:28.580
So does that mean we don't call it out?

03:00:28.580 --> 03:00:29.620
We wait till next time?

03:00:29.620 --> 03:00:34.220
Because calling it out is giving fuel to the division.

03:00:34.220 --> 03:00:38.100
Like the people that doubted the validity of the election,

03:00:38.100 --> 03:00:40.900
that's anger, that's frustration with the other side.

03:00:40.900 --> 03:00:44.180
You heal that as opposed to saying all those people

03:00:44.180 --> 03:00:47.660
that believed that at any time are idiots.

03:00:47.660 --> 03:00:49.140
They're un-American.

03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:50.740
I mean, they don't think the election was real.

03:00:50.740 --> 03:00:52.940
I don't know if Biden has the ears of these people at all.

03:00:52.940 --> 03:00:55.020
I don't know what he can do for.

03:00:55.020 --> 03:00:57.980
There's people that believe the same thing in 2016

03:00:57.980 --> 03:00:59.540
with the Russian hacking, right?

03:00:59.540 --> 03:01:00.540
There's this.

03:01:00.540 --> 03:01:01.380
Hold on.

03:01:01.380 --> 03:01:02.580
Yes.

03:01:02.580 --> 03:01:04.500
That is a super not fair comparison.

03:01:05.420 --> 03:01:08.940
There are definitely the mainstream Democrat opinion

03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:12.740
was that Russian intrusion

03:01:12.740 --> 03:01:14.820
in terms of like social media and stuff happened,

03:01:14.820 --> 03:01:17.460
but there was never a claim that like the election was stolen.

03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:19.900
Or at least I don't know of any mainstream Democrat

03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:20.820
that supported that.

03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:22.020
Donald Trump is not just saying

03:01:22.020 --> 03:01:23.260
there was interference and blah, blah, blah.

03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:25.020
Donald Trump is literally saying the election

03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:28.740
was literally stolen, that ballot boxes were hidden,

03:01:28.740 --> 03:01:30.700
that vote tallies were manipulated.

03:01:30.700 --> 03:01:33.140
I think the claim is there's a huge gulf of difference

03:01:33.140 --> 03:01:33.980
between the two.

03:01:33.980 --> 03:01:36.540
So you can attack Donald Trump for that.

03:01:36.540 --> 03:01:37.540
Yeah.

03:01:37.540 --> 03:01:40.340
I believe it's not the words of a uniter

03:01:40.340 --> 03:01:43.980
to attack people that believe that.

03:01:45.020 --> 03:01:47.260
You could argue maybe it's okay,

03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:50.020
but especially not being super clear about that,

03:01:50.020 --> 03:01:52.980
about who you're referring to when you say mega Republicans.

03:01:52.980 --> 03:01:57.980
Cause MAGA is a hat and a slogan

03:01:59.580 --> 03:02:02.780
that refers to whatever the number is,

03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:05.860
70 million people, however, that voted for Donald Trump.

03:02:05.860 --> 03:02:06.700
Like-

03:02:06.700 --> 03:02:07.540
Of all the Republicans that consider themselves

03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:09.980
MAGA Republicans, what percentage of them do you think

03:02:09.980 --> 03:02:11.540
believe the election was stolen?

03:02:12.380 --> 03:02:13.700
I feel like that number is, I don't have the pump,

03:02:13.700 --> 03:02:17.100
I feel like the number is like probably more than 70%.

03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:18.900
What's a MAGA Republican?

03:02:18.900 --> 03:02:19.740
Maybe I'm not-

03:02:19.740 --> 03:02:21.460
Like a Trump supporting Republican, a MAGA Republican.

03:02:21.460 --> 03:02:23.140
They're there for Trump.

03:02:23.140 --> 03:02:25.180
What's the difference between somebody that voted for Trump

03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:27.860
and a MAGA Republican?

03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:30.660
So my mom is a MAGA Republican.

03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:33.420
If Trump ran independently and DeSantis ran

03:02:33.420 --> 03:02:36.060
under the Republican ticket, my mom would vote for Trump.

03:02:36.060 --> 03:02:37.460
She'll follow him to the end of the earth.

03:02:37.460 --> 03:02:38.820
That's like a MAGA Republican.

03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:42.140
I think it's easy to mistake that distinction

03:02:42.140 --> 03:02:44.180
in these kinds of political speeches.

03:02:44.180 --> 03:02:46.660
It's to me, anybody who voted for Trump

03:02:47.220 --> 03:02:49.140
can easily in the context of the speech

03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:51.780
be interpreted as a MAGA Republican.

03:02:51.780 --> 03:02:52.620
Gotcha.

03:02:55.060 --> 03:02:56.100
I understand what you're saying.

03:02:56.100 --> 03:02:56.940
Maybe you could have been more clear,

03:02:56.940 --> 03:02:58.620
but like I think in listening to that,

03:02:58.620 --> 03:03:01.420
like I think it's pretty obvious who he's talking about,

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:03.340
but I guess if you have an emotional response to it,

03:03:03.340 --> 03:03:04.460
I can understand the emotional response,

03:03:04.460 --> 03:03:05.300
but there's a lot of people-

03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:06.620
I don't have an emotional response.

03:03:06.620 --> 03:03:09.900
I just don't like, I think I'm with, what is it?

03:03:09.900 --> 03:03:11.300
Michelle Obama.

03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:13.300
They go low, we go high.

03:03:13.300 --> 03:03:17.460
Meaning like to me, a uniter doesn't participate

03:03:17.460 --> 03:03:18.460
in derision.

03:03:18.460 --> 03:03:20.500
Sure, a uniter might not, but a leader has to be able

03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:23.060
to accurately assess the situation before him

03:03:23.060 --> 03:03:24.180
and make people aware of what's going on.

03:03:24.180 --> 03:03:26.100
You mean all the impeachment trials,

03:03:26.100 --> 03:03:28.620
all the censoring from social media,

03:03:28.620 --> 03:03:30.340
all of that didn't do the job?

03:03:30.340 --> 03:03:31.460
That's not his job.

03:03:31.460 --> 03:03:32.660
I don't know about censoring any of that.

03:03:32.660 --> 03:03:35.340
That mechanism, his job is to inspire a nation

03:03:35.340 --> 03:03:36.740
to unite a nation.

03:03:36.740 --> 03:03:38.220
How can he do that when half the people don't believe

03:03:38.220 --> 03:03:40.180
that he was even legitimately elected?

03:03:40.180 --> 03:03:42.180
Like I think he's done a good job at working on legislation

03:03:42.180 --> 03:03:44.380
and doing stuff that hopefully benefits all Americans.

03:03:44.380 --> 03:03:46.100
But I think it's important to recognize that like

03:03:46.100 --> 03:03:49.220
there is a contingent of Americans that don't even believe

03:03:49.220 --> 03:03:50.060
like this is really crazy.

03:03:50.060 --> 03:03:51.860
There's plenty of people that recognize that

03:03:51.860 --> 03:03:53.980
and are fighting that and are constantly screaming that

03:03:53.980 --> 03:03:55.180
from the rooftops.

03:03:55.180 --> 03:03:59.500
His job is to be the inspiring figure

03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:02.420
that makes the majority of Americans be proud

03:04:02.420 --> 03:04:05.940
for him to be a president of the nation they love.

03:04:05.940 --> 03:04:08.700
And that's what the uniting aspect is.

03:04:08.740 --> 03:04:12.180
Is you remind people that we are one

03:04:12.180 --> 03:04:13.180
and we love this country,

03:04:13.180 --> 03:04:14.860
we love the ideas that it represents.

03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:16.220
He does that in other parts of that speech.

03:04:16.220 --> 03:04:17.500
It's like a 20 minute speech, isn't it?

03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:19.100
But that's a fuck up.

03:04:19.100 --> 03:04:21.620
You just don't participate in that division.

03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:23.740
Anyway, I understand.

03:04:23.740 --> 03:04:24.580
I understand.

03:04:24.580 --> 03:04:26.300
I just wanted to push back on the saying

03:04:26.300 --> 03:04:30.540
one of his strengths is that he's uniting.

03:04:30.540 --> 03:04:34.300
But yes, that is an ideal.

03:04:34.300 --> 03:04:36.100
That is a goal, is a great one.

03:04:36.100 --> 03:04:40.140
And he is one that espouse that goal for a long time.

03:04:40.140 --> 03:04:42.340
Do you think, what else?

03:04:42.340 --> 03:04:44.580
So from policy perspective and so on.

03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:45.940
I thought the way he's handled Ukraine and everything

03:04:45.940 --> 03:04:47.580
thus far has been almost perfect.

03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:49.620
I think he did a really good job

03:04:49.620 --> 03:04:51.100
at the political maneuvering

03:04:51.100 --> 03:04:52.620
and bringing other countries into the fold

03:04:52.620 --> 03:04:54.740
at establishing clearly like what our mission was

03:04:54.740 --> 03:04:55.580
in relation to Ukraine.

03:04:55.580 --> 03:04:57.220
I thought he did a good job there.

03:04:57.220 --> 03:04:59.020
I admire him for pulling out of Afghanistan.

03:04:59.020 --> 03:05:00.780
Even it was a little bit rough around the edges.

03:05:00.780 --> 03:05:02.340
Like we got out and we're gone.

03:05:02.340 --> 03:05:03.740
No American lives are lost.

03:05:04.580 --> 03:05:07.980
The domestic policy, he's passed more major legislation

03:05:07.980 --> 03:05:10.300
than I think anybody thought possible.

03:05:10.300 --> 03:05:11.900
The green energy stuff for the last bill,

03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:13.700
the infrastructure bill,

03:05:13.700 --> 03:05:15.620
a lot of the coronavirus relief I thought was really good

03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:18.180
especially expansion of the child tax credit.

03:05:18.180 --> 03:05:19.740
So from a policy perspective,

03:05:19.740 --> 03:05:21.660
foreign and domestic, I think he's been successful.

03:05:21.660 --> 03:05:24.260
Rhetorically, I think he's generally been above board

03:05:24.260 --> 03:05:25.340
in terms of like not attacking people

03:05:25.340 --> 03:05:26.820
or being too divisive.

03:05:26.820 --> 03:05:28.860
He's trying to bring people together and work on them.

03:05:28.860 --> 03:05:32.260
What do you think about the sort of popular in the media

03:05:32.260 --> 03:05:34.340
criticism of his mental decline?

03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:35.420
Do you think he's experiencing mental decline?

03:05:35.420 --> 03:05:37.340
You know, he's an old guy.

03:05:37.340 --> 03:05:39.140
But do you think, I mean.

03:05:39.140 --> 03:05:41.260
Yeah, maybe a little bit,

03:05:41.260 --> 03:05:43.300
but he's still doing a good job, so you know.

03:05:43.300 --> 03:05:44.540
Not from a speech perspective,

03:05:44.540 --> 03:05:45.740
you mean from a policy perspective?

03:05:45.740 --> 03:05:47.460
Yeah, I'm analyzing it as a job, yeah.

03:05:47.460 --> 03:05:49.460
From a speech perspective, maybe not the greatest,

03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:51.820
but yeah, I mean, he's definitely, what is he like 80, 81?

03:05:51.820 --> 03:05:52.660
How old is he?

03:05:52.660 --> 03:05:54.420
I lose track after so many years.

03:05:56.260 --> 03:05:59.660
But you did say that he's probably going to run in 2024

03:05:59.660 --> 03:06:01.220
and he's probably going to win.

03:06:01.220 --> 03:06:02.060
Did I say that?

03:06:02.900 --> 03:06:06.540
He's probably going to run, who knows who will win.

03:06:06.540 --> 03:06:08.860
But I think, I feel like the incumbent advantage

03:06:08.860 --> 03:06:09.700
is so strong.

03:06:09.700 --> 03:06:10.740
Are you really going to throw that away?

03:06:10.740 --> 03:06:12.860
Things like one or two times in history in the US, right,

03:06:12.860 --> 03:06:14.380
where like the non-incumbent,

03:06:14.380 --> 03:06:16.140
the parties put somebody else up.

03:06:16.140 --> 03:06:18.900
Yeah, I mean, the concern is like the,

03:06:18.900 --> 03:06:21.940
just the age and the mental decline,

03:06:21.940 --> 03:06:25.980
just the wear and tear of the campaign,

03:06:25.980 --> 03:06:26.820
all of that kind of stuff.

03:06:26.820 --> 03:06:28.060
All of the speech you have to make,

03:06:28.060 --> 03:06:29.540
the debates and all that kind of stuff.

03:06:29.540 --> 03:06:30.900
Yeah, I guess we'll see what happens.

03:06:31.340 --> 03:06:33.180
What?

03:06:33.180 --> 03:06:34.860
The least excited.

03:06:34.860 --> 03:06:36.500
I mean, two years from now is a long time.

03:06:36.500 --> 03:06:39.860
At his current mental state, he could run and do it.

03:06:39.860 --> 03:06:41.980
He could do a passable job in two years.

03:06:41.980 --> 03:06:42.820
Man, I don't know.

03:06:42.820 --> 03:06:43.820
I've seen videos of Bill Clinton recently.

03:06:43.820 --> 03:06:45.060
He's looking pretty rough.

03:06:46.060 --> 03:06:48.220
You know, if Biden is looking a lot more rough,

03:06:48.220 --> 03:06:49.340
worse for wear in two years,

03:06:49.340 --> 03:06:53.500
then maybe they actually do have to dig out another person

03:06:53.500 --> 03:06:54.580
for running on us.

03:06:56.620 --> 03:06:58.860
What do you think about Trump

03:06:58.900 --> 03:07:01.420
when he won in 2016,

03:07:01.420 --> 03:07:05.700
I think is when you came to fruition politically speaking.

03:07:05.700 --> 03:07:09.420
So what do you think his winning the 2016 election

03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:11.300
represents?

03:07:11.300 --> 03:07:16.140
So for me, Trump, the reason why I got into politics

03:07:16.140 --> 03:07:20.140
was Trump was like this new epistemic force

03:07:20.140 --> 03:07:22.580
in American politics that like,

03:07:22.580 --> 03:07:25.540
you kind of have to like flirt with facts before,

03:07:25.540 --> 03:07:27.020
even if you wanted to be non-factual.

03:07:27.060 --> 03:07:28.900
He super didn't care.

03:07:28.900 --> 03:07:30.580
Lying was like a first language to him,

03:07:30.580 --> 03:07:32.620
just like in speaking in terms of like,

03:07:32.620 --> 03:07:35.420
the way that he used language to just say to you

03:07:35.420 --> 03:07:37.900
what he felt like you needed to hear to support him

03:07:37.900 --> 03:07:41.060
and not care at all about what is going on about.

03:07:41.060 --> 03:07:43.820
Yeah, that's what Trump represented to me

03:07:43.820 --> 03:07:46.220
in terms of like things that I cared about.

03:07:46.220 --> 03:07:47.660
He also represents a lot more obviously

03:07:47.660 --> 03:07:49.740
that there was this undercurrent of American opinion

03:07:49.740 --> 03:07:51.700
that a lot of people didn't know still existed

03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:53.700
and it did, he got elected.

03:07:53.700 --> 03:07:55.420
That the Overton window was misidentified

03:07:55.420 --> 03:07:57.460
by even a large amount of the Republican party

03:07:57.460 --> 03:07:59.300
that populism was a lot more popular

03:07:59.300 --> 03:08:01.300
than a lot of people figured, you know?

03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:03.060
Yeah, there's a lot that I guess he represented.

03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:06.300
Do you think Trump should have been banned from Twitter?

03:08:06.300 --> 03:08:08.060
Can you make the case for and against it?

03:08:08.060 --> 03:08:10.220
So you're a big supporter of free speech.

03:08:10.220 --> 03:08:13.060
Yeah, so the case in favor of it.

03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:15.060
Do you think he should be brought back?

03:08:16.780 --> 03:08:17.940
Yeah, because if he gets brought back,

03:08:17.940 --> 03:08:19.100
there's a higher chance that I'll be brought back.

03:08:19.100 --> 03:08:20.660
So I'm supporting that all the way.

03:08:20.660 --> 03:08:22.660
Thank you, Elon, unban my account.

03:08:23.660 --> 03:08:26.620
So because you called me weak spine,

03:08:26.620 --> 03:08:28.180
I'm gonna have to message Elon.

03:08:28.180 --> 03:08:30.780
Okay, at Omnidestiny, it was a verified Twitter account.

03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:31.820
Omnidestiny.

03:08:31.820 --> 03:08:32.820
No, no, I'm just kidding.

03:08:32.820 --> 03:08:34.580
Why'd you get banned from Twitter, Destiny?

03:08:34.580 --> 03:08:35.420
I don't know.

03:08:35.420 --> 03:08:37.220
I'll add that to Elon.

03:08:37.220 --> 03:08:40.380
I saw that there was a screenshot of you

03:08:41.460 --> 03:08:43.980
referring to the rape of somebody.

03:08:43.980 --> 03:08:45.660
Okay, that was on an older Twitter account

03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:46.700
and that was a bad tweet.

03:08:46.700 --> 03:08:48.540
You have multiple Twitter accounts,

03:08:48.540 --> 03:08:51.380
so you're trying to go around the bans

03:08:51.380 --> 03:08:52.340
that you keep getting.

03:08:52.980 --> 03:08:53.820
Okay, hold on.

03:08:53.820 --> 03:08:55.420
You're slandering me a lot right now, okay?

03:08:55.420 --> 03:08:56.980
Let's get the facts straight, okay?

03:08:56.980 --> 03:08:58.980
I don't even remember why my first time I got banned,

03:08:58.980 --> 03:09:00.220
but it was a wild account.

03:09:00.220 --> 03:09:02.340
I tweeted some wildly inappropriate things.

03:09:02.340 --> 03:09:03.260
You regret?

03:09:03.260 --> 03:09:04.100
I don't like that word.

03:09:04.100 --> 03:09:05.100
I'm gonna give the answer that most people give,

03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:05.940
but it's like, I don't regret it,

03:09:05.940 --> 03:09:06.780
because I learned a lot.

03:09:06.780 --> 03:09:08.340
So I'm glad I had the bad experiences that I did.

03:09:08.340 --> 03:09:10.100
Why don't you like the word regret?

03:09:10.100 --> 03:09:13.700
I think if we look at where we are,

03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:15.340
how do you feel about determinism?

03:09:18.020 --> 03:09:20.300
I believe in the hardest of determinism.

03:09:20.300 --> 03:09:21.460
That's who I am, okay?

03:09:21.500 --> 03:09:24.540
So who I am today is the culmination of everything

03:09:24.540 --> 03:09:25.380
that's occurred in the past.

03:09:25.380 --> 03:09:28.220
I believe you speaking, sorry to interrupt,

03:09:28.220 --> 03:09:31.300
I believe in you speaking about regret

03:09:31.300 --> 03:09:33.780
is a nice way to communicate

03:09:33.780 --> 03:09:35.740
that in this deterministic world,

03:09:35.740 --> 03:09:38.140
you've analyzed the acts of the past

03:09:38.140 --> 03:09:39.780
and you're no longer that person.

03:09:39.780 --> 03:09:40.860
Yeah, of course, for sure.

03:09:40.860 --> 03:09:43.100
That's what regret usually means.

03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:44.780
Okay, thanks for giving me the human explanation.

03:09:44.780 --> 03:09:45.620
Okay, true.

03:09:45.620 --> 03:09:46.860
So in that sense, there's a lot of things I've done

03:09:46.860 --> 03:09:48.420
that I regret.

03:09:48.420 --> 03:09:49.260
What are you?

03:09:49.260 --> 03:09:51.260
You're not human, you're a bot?

03:09:52.060 --> 03:09:53.460
I'm human, right?

03:09:53.460 --> 03:09:55.280
NPC is my preferred term.

03:09:55.280 --> 03:09:58.100
I wish I would've been smart enough at the time

03:09:58.100 --> 03:10:00.420
to not have to have had made those mistakes.

03:10:00.420 --> 03:10:01.260
There we go.

03:10:01.260 --> 03:10:02.100
Good job.

03:10:02.100 --> 03:10:03.580
But yeah, obviously really dumb,

03:10:03.580 --> 03:10:05.940
really crazy off the wall tweets.

03:10:05.940 --> 03:10:06.780
But that account got banned.

03:10:06.780 --> 03:10:08.420
But then I made another account.

03:10:09.660 --> 03:10:11.620
I can't blame the history, for Twitter accounts,

03:10:11.620 --> 03:10:12.740
but another account called Omnidestiny.

03:10:12.740 --> 03:10:13.580
It's an honor.

03:10:13.580 --> 03:10:15.900
And that was my, I got verified.

03:10:15.900 --> 03:10:16.740
I was cool.

03:10:16.740 --> 03:10:17.740
They let me have that account

03:10:17.740 --> 03:10:18.580
because originally they banned it

03:10:18.580 --> 03:10:19.420
and I said appeal and I was like,

03:10:19.420 --> 03:10:20.780
oh, let me have one more.

03:10:20.780 --> 03:10:26.540
for it. And that account lasted for a long time and I don't actually know 100% why that account

03:10:26.540 --> 03:10:33.180
got banned. I believe that the tweet that showed up in the final, I got banned for hate speech

03:10:33.180 --> 03:10:38.060
and it was because I was, there was a picture that I tweeted with three different alt-righters that

03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:42.620
are kind of like neo-Nazi people and they were all like mixed race people and I said like the new

03:10:42.620 --> 03:10:47.180
alt-right looks like a Disney Channel original movie in terms of racial composition and somehow

03:10:47.180 --> 03:10:52.220
they got flagged for instigating violence against minorities I think. And I think that's the tweet

03:10:52.220 --> 03:10:55.420
that got me banned because I think that's what showed up in the final report. But I don't know,

03:10:55.420 --> 03:10:58.540
maybe there were other reasons because nobody ever communicates. But ever since that account

03:10:58.540 --> 03:11:04.460
went under, it's just been ban evading ever since so. Oh, ban evading ever since. So all my new

03:11:04.460 --> 03:11:06.780
accounts that I'm going to ban just get banned because they finally figure out it's me and then

03:11:06.780 --> 03:11:11.980
they ban evade. There's like one dude at Twitter HQ who's like constantly looking for my new accounts

03:11:11.980 --> 03:11:20.380
and they get me, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, yeah. So post-Trump world. Do you think, okay, I mean-

03:11:20.380 --> 03:11:25.820
Oh, should he be banned? Oh, you asked me to make both cases. Should he be banned? I mean, damn dude,

03:11:25.820 --> 03:11:30.300
when you're tweeting out shit that's arguably leading to stuff like January 6th, I can understand

03:11:30.300 --> 03:11:33.260
why because it's like what else is this wild dude going to tweet out? Like is he going to start

03:11:33.260 --> 03:11:36.940
instigating other violent events? So I'm sympathetic towards the like, okay, well he can't just be here

03:11:36.940 --> 03:11:41.020
saying stuff like this. That's insane. We're going to ban him. I'm sympathetic- Because it's

03:11:41.020 --> 03:11:46.300
instigating actual physical violence in the physical world. Yeah. Like if I would tweet

03:11:46.300 --> 03:11:50.780
stuff like that, I would get banned probably. On the flip side, this is the president of the United

03:11:50.780 --> 03:11:55.420
States. It seems like he's like doing presidential decree by social media sometimes. Like is it

03:11:55.420 --> 03:12:01.660
really right that one public or private, I should say, one private company can like erase the

03:12:01.660 --> 03:12:05.100
president of the United States words from the eyes of a lot of Americans that are using these

03:12:05.100 --> 03:12:12.700
social media feeds. And one big one, which I for sure am against, is the permanent ban. Yeah,

03:12:12.700 --> 03:12:16.700
I don't like that. I hate that. Even in my community, if somebody comes back over like a year,

03:12:16.700 --> 03:12:19.900
like I mean- Did you just compare yourself to the president of the United States? No,

03:12:19.900 --> 03:12:22.540
I compare myself to Twitter banning the president of the United States. Let me put it this way,

03:12:22.540 --> 03:12:27.660
if I banned Donald Trump in my chat room, I'd unban him in a year. A year? Yeah. What's the

03:12:27.660 --> 03:12:31.980
process for unbanning Donald Trump? What would he have to do? Usually people send me an email,

03:12:31.980 --> 03:12:35.500
they're like, listen, I did this stuff, I'm sorry I was dumb, I'll give him another chance.

03:12:35.500 --> 03:12:37.900
But a year, what if they send an email a month later?

03:12:38.460 --> 03:12:41.500
Usually I'll unban him. That's usually my problem. I ban pretty quickly in my community,

03:12:41.500 --> 03:12:43.500
but if you ever ask- You're a big softie.

03:12:43.500 --> 03:12:47.900
Yeah, I usually let him back. Well, because I used to be the worst type of internet person,

03:12:47.900 --> 03:12:51.180
and I think I'm a little bit better than I used to be. Now that you're older.

03:12:51.180 --> 03:12:55.900
Yeah, now that I've matured. Yeah, of course. Age bestows a wisdom that just can't be gotten

03:12:55.900 --> 03:12:59.340
any other way. What's your sense in general? Is there something interesting you could say

03:12:59.340 --> 03:13:02.940
about your view on free speech? It seems like one of those terms that's also

03:13:03.740 --> 03:13:06.780
overused to mean a lot of different things. What does it mean to you?

03:13:06.780 --> 03:13:12.780
If you have a democratic style of governance, you are entrusting people with one of the most

03:13:12.780 --> 03:13:16.780
awesome and radical of responsibilities. And that's saying that you're going to pick the

03:13:16.780 --> 03:13:19.900
people that are going to make some of the hardest decisions in all of human history.

03:13:19.900 --> 03:13:24.300
If you're going to trust people to vote correctly, you have to be able to trust them to have open

03:13:24.300 --> 03:13:28.700
and honest dialogue with each other. Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,

03:13:29.420 --> 03:13:33.660
you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above and make the correct

03:13:33.660 --> 03:13:37.900
determinations when they hear these types of speeches. And if you're so worried that somebody

03:13:37.900 --> 03:13:41.260
is going to hear a certain political figure and they're going to be completely radicalized

03:13:41.260 --> 03:13:45.500
instantly, then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans for democracy

03:13:45.500 --> 03:13:49.980
to be a viable institution, which is fine. You can be anti-democratic, but I don't think you can be

03:13:49.980 --> 03:13:55.260
pro-democracy and anti-free speech. Within reason. So what's the within reason?

03:13:56.220 --> 03:13:59.020
You can't post like child porn or something on Twitter where people try to get you on that

03:13:59.020 --> 03:14:02.060
stuff or like direct calls to violence or probably not. You shouldn't be tweeting out like,

03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:04.060
we're going to meet up tomorrow and go bomb, blah, blah, blah.

03:14:04.060 --> 03:14:09.180
So do you think it's okay to allow racism and anti-Semitism and hate speech?

03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:17.100
Hate speech, yes, because that can be very broadly defined. I can understand there being some basic

03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:22.540
rules of like no slurs on like a platform that gets into like acceptable forms of moderation or

03:14:22.540 --> 03:14:28.620
like excessive harassment and bullying. I can understand. But past that, when the moderation

03:14:28.620 --> 03:14:33.660
becomes ideological, I get a little bit nervous because there's a whole other host.

03:14:34.620 --> 03:14:40.220
Of course, it's all a gray area, but when it feels like ideology has seeped into the censorship.

03:14:40.220 --> 03:14:40.780
Not good.

03:14:40.780 --> 03:14:45.500
Yeah, which it's so fascinating to think, especially now that Elon bought Twitter,

03:14:45.500 --> 03:14:53.020
how do you engineer a system that prevents ideology from seeping in and nevertheless is

03:14:53.020 --> 03:14:58.140
able to create a platform that has healthy conversations? Because if you have one guy

03:14:58.140 --> 03:15:04.540
who's just screaming nonsense nonstop, it has this effect where the quiet voices at the back

03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:10.060
of the room are silenced. So like that's what you usually don't talk about. Like if you let

03:15:10.060 --> 03:15:14.300
one annoying loud person in, that's actually censoring the voice of a lot of people that

03:15:14.300 --> 03:15:17.820
would like to speak, but they don't get a chance. That's one of the things, especially around like

03:15:17.820 --> 03:15:22.540
trans discourse. I have to constantly do that like reminder for my audiences. So like when I'm

03:15:22.540 --> 03:15:25.660
dealing with these types of people on the internet, a lot of them might seem really crazy. A lot of

03:15:25.660 --> 03:15:29.260
these types of people might seem insane, but like in the real world, outside of like the crazy

03:15:29.260 --> 03:15:33.420
Twitter activist world, like the vast majority of people you're meeting from LGBT communities

03:15:33.420 --> 03:15:36.940
are like the coolest, normalist people. All they want is to like write, to live their life in the

03:15:36.940 --> 03:15:41.260
way they want to and to be like unobstructed and like, yeah, but people will get this impression

03:15:41.260 --> 03:15:45.980
of like an online activist, like a vegan or LGBT person or whatever. And then they think that every

03:15:45.980 --> 03:15:50.460
single person in real life is like that. And it's a really negative stereotype. And then even the

03:15:50.460 --> 03:15:54.700
other people in that group. Oh, is Malina coming over? Oh yeah, I see. I don't know if that's her.

03:15:55.260 --> 03:16:01.180
Okay. Malina just joined us. What were we talking about? Was it interesting? You were saying that

03:16:01.180 --> 03:16:04.860
you were going to talk to Elon about getting at Omnidestiny, the verified Twitter account,

03:16:04.860 --> 03:16:08.540
unbanned. I said, that sounds like a lot. That's so gracious of you. I can't even believe you would

03:16:08.540 --> 03:16:12.860
do that for me. And then you admitted that you tried to evade the ban multiple times,

03:16:12.860 --> 03:16:17.340
which I'm sure would be very looked upon. You know, I heard that in Norway, in their prison system,

03:16:17.340 --> 03:16:20.460
they don't actually punish you for trying to escape jail because that's like the natural human thing

03:16:20.460 --> 03:16:23.660
to do. They hug you? I don't know if they, but they don't punish you because of course you're

03:16:23.660 --> 03:16:26.620
trying to be free. That's all I'm trying to be on Twitter. I'm just trying to be free. Oh, that's

03:16:26.620 --> 03:16:30.220
the natural humanistic. Yeah, that's the natural human, of course it's the banning ban. You're not

03:16:30.220 --> 03:16:33.820
a destructive force. No, I'm a positive, I'm a force for good. That's why all my accounts only

03:16:33.820 --> 03:16:37.020
get banned for banning and banning. I don't get banned for doing bad things. And I'm a progressive

03:16:37.020 --> 03:16:41.820
show. I'm like far left. I love like progressive causes. I thought this is what you criticize

03:16:41.820 --> 03:16:47.980
us on for being. I show them from a place of first principles, not from a mindless AI echoing kind

03:16:47.980 --> 03:16:52.940
of thing, you know? Okay. So you're a free thinking bot. Yeah, exactly. All right, cool. Well,

03:16:52.940 --> 03:16:59.100
I'm sure we'll return to some politics. That was beautiful. Melia, can you tell us about yourself?

03:16:59.100 --> 03:17:03.100
You're also a fellow streamer. Yes. What's your story? I stream and I started streaming because

03:17:03.100 --> 03:17:08.540
I met him basically, kind of, but I don't do the politics. I do like travels or talk about

03:17:08.540 --> 03:17:14.300
relationships, talk to my audience basically. You're from that part of the world, right? Sweden.

03:17:14.300 --> 03:17:18.620
Yeah, exactly. So did you escape from prison and they didn't? That was Norway, especially

03:17:18.620 --> 03:17:23.500
Norway. That's different. I've actually really, I've been to Sweden a bunch of times. I love it.

03:17:23.500 --> 03:17:28.060
There's a tech sector there that's really like flourishing. Where did you go? Which city?

03:17:28.060 --> 03:17:32.860
I went to Stockholm. I think I gave a few lectures there. There's a vibrant tech sector. It was cool.

03:17:32.940 --> 03:17:38.460
And people are super nice. Yeah, we're friendly. We're not like very deep. Like we don't really

03:17:38.460 --> 03:17:42.780
have much deep conversation. It's like a meta. Oh, there's not many intellectuals that come from

03:17:42.780 --> 03:17:46.460
Sweden. We don't really speak very highly of ourselves. We kind of like just chill all the

03:17:46.460 --> 03:17:51.340
time. We don't make a scene. We don't, we're just like, you know. Do you know what the name for that

03:17:51.340 --> 03:17:56.620
is? There's a specific name for it. It's De Lagen. Yeah, De Lagen. Yeah. Oh, there's a philosophy

03:17:56.620 --> 03:18:00.220
behind it. When you're part of like Sweden or Norway, you like, you don't talk too highly of

03:18:00.220 --> 03:18:04.060
yourself because it's seen as kind of like rude. Like think of like America except the exact opposite.

03:18:04.060 --> 03:18:07.180
You don't even really want to like, you don't want to make yourself into a victim too much. You don't

03:18:07.180 --> 03:18:11.740
want to be too much of anything. You're just like sticking to the group to make big scene about

03:18:11.740 --> 03:18:17.820
yourself. But that said, you came here and you were, you put yourself in front of a camera and

03:18:17.820 --> 03:18:20.940
became a streamer. Yes. Do you understand how weird that is for my friends in Sweden?

03:18:21.660 --> 03:18:25.500
Do you have anxiety? I just didn't talk about myself and just like make a big deal about myself

03:18:25.500 --> 03:18:29.340
for hours every day. Was that like terrifying? Did you have anxiety about that? No, because I

03:18:29.340 --> 03:18:33.980
don't see them. But then I come back and I'm like, Ooh. So what do you feel like when you're

03:18:33.980 --> 03:18:38.300
actually streaming? You feel like you're just alone in a room? One-on-one type of thing? No,

03:18:38.300 --> 03:18:41.660
I see, I see Chad and I'm thinking, Oh, they're like a little fairies. They're not really real.

03:18:41.660 --> 03:18:44.860
They're just like out there. I don't know what they look like. I just see little names and they're

03:18:44.860 --> 03:18:49.660
just cute and just colors. You're talking to little fairies inside your head. Is that how

03:18:49.660 --> 03:18:54.300
you feel about Chad? They're demons for me. They're demons. Okay. My Anna fairies. Are they,

03:18:54.300 --> 03:18:57.500
so is Chad a source of stress or happiness? Like, is there a commander? No, for me,

03:18:57.500 --> 03:19:01.100
that's a source of happiness. I've been very intentional with like the construction of my

03:19:01.100 --> 03:19:05.100
community. So I'm really happy with where it's at. How are you able to actually have deep

03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:09.900
political discourse while playing a video game at the same time? I have a really good chat room

03:19:09.900 --> 03:19:13.580
in terms of like the way that people engage in conversations. Like I was one of the earliest

03:19:13.580 --> 03:19:19.420
people to embrace the philosophy of like, I am in total control of what people watch me think,

03:19:19.420 --> 03:19:23.820
that like I have a high level of responsibility for how they conduct themselves. And then if I

03:19:23.820 --> 03:19:26.940
conduct myself in a certain way, I can expect a certain level of conduct from them. And for the

03:19:26.940 --> 03:19:30.780
most part, it's like worked pretty well for the past, you know, nine or 10 years. Yeah.

03:19:30.780 --> 03:19:34.220
What about the actual playing of the game? Like you're able to parallelize

03:19:34.220 --> 03:19:39.420
the brain, like, oh, like it seems like factory seems like a super complex game. Yeah,

03:19:39.420 --> 03:19:42.220
I don't actually think that's possible. I don't think multitasking for human brain is possible.

03:19:43.180 --> 03:19:46.860
If you see me playing a game, usually what's happening is the conversation is like,

03:19:46.860 --> 03:19:50.220
I've had it a million times, so I'm not thinking about it. I've automated that. Or if the

03:19:50.220 --> 03:19:54.220
conversation is very challenging, then if you watch me, if you really watch what's happening,

03:19:54.220 --> 03:19:56.700
I'm probably just running around in circles because I have to think about the conversation.

03:19:56.700 --> 03:20:00.540
Okay. Because with factory, it looks like a lot of stuff is going on. Sometimes, yeah.

03:20:00.540 --> 03:20:04.780
So I guess it's hard for a person who hasn't played the game to detect that you're not.

03:20:04.780 --> 03:20:07.980
Does that come off as like, you're super intelligent and multitask? Or does it come

03:20:07.980 --> 03:20:12.220
off as like, he's not interested in this conversation at all? Yeah, there's a coolness

03:20:12.220 --> 03:20:17.420
to it. Like when you're not paying attention, like if you're looking elsewhere, like you're

03:20:17.420 --> 03:20:20.540
checking your phone, you're too cool for this conversation. There's a sense like that. Yeah.

03:20:20.540 --> 03:20:23.820
The reality is, though, is if you watch, it was easier to see in Minecraft, because in

03:20:23.820 --> 03:20:26.300
Minecraft, when there was a challenging conversation, if you watch me play, I'm

03:20:26.300 --> 03:20:28.940
literally just running around and jumping in circles because I have to think about the

03:20:28.940 --> 03:20:33.180
conversation 100%. I can't do a complicated task and think about the conversation. Or like that

03:20:33.180 --> 03:20:36.780
people always joke in my chat, like, oh no, the notepad came out. If it's a really challenging

03:20:36.780 --> 03:20:39.820
conversation, I'll get rid of the game and I'll bring out a notepad and I'll start writing stuff

03:20:39.820 --> 03:20:44.860
down to keep track of what's going on. Yeah. So what kind of stuff do you stream? So advice?

03:20:44.860 --> 03:20:48.780
You talk about relationships. Yeah, like either I talk to chat or I travel around, basically.

03:20:49.660 --> 03:20:55.260
Have a conversation so we like go to countries. I've been to like Italy. I was in Italy for like

03:20:55.260 --> 03:21:01.100
one and a half months, just like traveling around alone, going to cities, like having like my camera

03:21:01.100 --> 03:21:07.180
with me and like streaming for hours. Where's the coolest place you've been to? Ever. It's probably

03:21:07.180 --> 03:21:11.740
New Zealand. New Zealand? I think so. Yeah. After it is probably going to be Italy, I think, because

03:21:11.740 --> 03:21:16.860
I like history and yeah. Oh, so both history, because New Zealand is also beautiful. So it's

03:21:16.860 --> 03:21:22.620
both natural beauty and historical beauty. Yeah, for sure. I think it's just really like the

03:21:22.620 --> 03:21:26.940
Polynesian sort of culture. I think it's very interesting, like the ocean people and it's just

03:21:26.940 --> 03:21:31.420
really beautiful. People are very relaxed, chill. They're very far away, which is interesting as

03:21:31.420 --> 03:21:36.940
well, because whenever they talk about politics or they talk about just like the world, it feels

03:21:36.940 --> 03:21:45.020
really far away. So where's home for you? Is Austin home? Home for me. So a human being is home?

03:21:45.820 --> 03:21:49.020
We've lived in a lot of different places and traveled around a lot. So that's what you think of home

03:21:49.020 --> 03:21:54.460
as like humans? I think so. Yeah. I mean, if they're going to be a place, it's probably going to be

03:21:54.460 --> 03:21:59.660
like my childhood places, probably. Yeah. Like my old country house or something like that. We don't

03:21:59.660 --> 03:22:04.220
have it anymore, but like that's like home for me, I guess. So how'd you guys meet each other?

03:22:04.940 --> 03:22:09.900
You're currently married. Yes. To each other, yeah. Yeah. To each other. Yeah.

03:22:10.460 --> 03:22:15.100
Just making sure we're on the same page. All right, cool. How'd you guys meet?

03:22:15.740 --> 03:22:21.260
I was watching his YouTube stuff, like 2018, I think, like because it was the Swedish election

03:22:21.260 --> 03:22:27.500
around that time and I was interested in politics. And then I think he said in one of his videos that

03:22:27.500 --> 03:22:32.620
he had an Instagram and that he needed people to stop DMing him. That wasn't cutie pies. And

03:22:32.620 --> 03:22:36.700
then I messaged him and said, am I a cutie pie? And then you replied in like two minutes.

03:22:36.700 --> 03:22:44.620
Yes. And then that's when I was in New Zealand. And I guess you wanted to escape America or like

03:22:44.620 --> 03:22:51.260
LA for a little bit and include New Zealand. Where were you mentally there? Because we've talked to

03:22:51.260 --> 03:22:58.780
this timeline. Where's 2018? Was it 18, 19? Where was the low point? That was way earlier. Low point

03:22:58.780 --> 03:23:03.820
carbon cleaning. That was like 2010. Oh, okay. 2018 was probably your peak.

03:23:05.100 --> 03:23:08.380
Every day. Now is my peak. What do you mean? That was my peak. Why would you say that?

03:23:09.340 --> 03:23:14.780
Nobody ever admits being past their prime. Well, I mean, my prime is still coming out.

03:23:14.780 --> 03:23:18.540
It was probably around the time where you were getting a lot of lefties through your community

03:23:18.540 --> 03:23:22.460
and you were really thinking about that they would go too far. Maybe. I think that was still

03:23:22.460 --> 03:23:26.780
when Hassan and Vash were both in my community. Exactly. So I would say it feels like there was

03:23:26.780 --> 03:23:31.420
not really like much issues when it comes to like to your stuff or like your work stuff back then.

03:23:31.420 --> 03:23:35.740
Oh, something we didn't talk about is that like there were no politics on Twitch. I exclusively

03:23:35.740 --> 03:23:39.100
inhabited that place for like two years because nobody else did it because it was a really toxic

03:23:39.100 --> 03:23:43.340
environment for politics. So for a couple of years as it grew, like I kind of grew the whole

03:23:43.340 --> 03:23:46.220
space because it wasn't nobody was doing it yet. What did that look like? You're having

03:23:47.500 --> 03:23:51.740
like political debates, political discourse. Yeah, mainly like going into YouTube people to

03:23:51.740 --> 03:23:55.340
try to argue with them or just doing politics on stream, like reading stories, researching stuff,

03:23:55.340 --> 03:23:58.860
talking about stuff. But there's not like other people on Twitch to debate about politics because

03:23:58.860 --> 03:24:04.460
there was no politics. It was yeah. Was there a debate in the space of communism, socialism,

03:24:04.460 --> 03:24:09.740
social democrats, kind of like this? Are you trying to outline your own position during that time?

03:24:09.740 --> 03:24:13.020
I think it was mainly me fighting against conservatives because it was like Trump stuff

03:24:13.020 --> 03:24:16.780
and then it was coming off the back of like there was this movement called Gamergate and there was

03:24:16.780 --> 03:24:21.660
all this anti-SJW stuff on the internet and I was like the SJW, like the progressive that was fighting

03:24:21.660 --> 03:24:24.380
on the progressive side of things. So I think that's what I was known for. But I was fighting

03:24:24.380 --> 03:24:28.060
with people off of Twitch because on Twitch there weren't very many political discussions happening.

03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:34.540
So you were holding the SJW flag. Yeah. To what, to what degree do you still hold it? Like what's

03:24:34.540 --> 03:24:39.980
the best, what's the steel man case for SJW? I mean like I'm still very much that SJW from 2018,

03:24:39.980 --> 03:24:44.460
2019, but the positions have moved so much farther left that I don't, some people might not call me

03:24:44.460 --> 03:24:48.220
that anymore. I'm not sure. It depends on who I'm talking to. So it's basically what is social

03:24:48.220 --> 03:24:52.780
justice where you like being sensitive to the experience of others. Yeah, being sensitive and

03:24:52.780 --> 03:24:55.500
empathetic towards the experience of others and then trying to build a better world that like

03:24:55.500 --> 03:24:59.660
suits as many different types of people as possible while being like aware of like their names.

03:24:59.660 --> 03:25:07.100
Okay. So you guys met, what's from your perspective? Is that, is she telling lies? Is it accurate?

03:25:07.100 --> 03:25:16.140
No, it's pretty accurate. Okay. When'd you guys actually meet? I flew out in 2019. Yeah, basically

03:25:16.140 --> 03:25:20.060
there was like weird stuff happening in LA. I just come off of kind of a weird, not kind of sort of

03:25:20.060 --> 03:25:24.140
relationship and I just wanted to like go away for a while. Another company reached out to me

03:25:24.140 --> 03:25:27.180
and they had like a fun streaming device and they said they'd sponsor a trip if I went somewhere.

03:25:27.180 --> 03:25:29.900
And I was like, oh, well, I know this person. I know a couple of people in New Zealand.

03:25:29.900 --> 03:25:32.860
Malina was one of them. It's like, I'll go to New Zealand, New Zealand. It'll be fun.

03:25:32.860 --> 03:25:35.900
And yeah, I did that for two weeks. Do you guys believe in love?

03:25:38.300 --> 03:25:42.540
I feel like you're, you lack the gotcha got us into this. I'm not sure to the degree to

03:25:42.540 --> 03:25:47.740
which you have human emotions. I have quite a few. Okay. From your perspective, when did you,

03:25:47.980 --> 03:25:50.460
when did you fall in love with Malina? When did you fall in love with Meli Mel?

03:25:52.140 --> 03:25:57.980
The minute I saw her. I don't know. We, our first two weeks together were a lot of fun. We had a

03:25:57.980 --> 03:26:02.780
lot of chemistry in person. I was kind of shocked that I wasn't thinking about it because it was

03:26:02.780 --> 03:26:06.780
like, we spent like a week together and you said, I really want to tell you something. And you were

03:26:06.780 --> 03:26:11.420
like, you were like stalling that for the longest time. I think she was, oh, she said that like,

03:26:11.420 --> 03:26:15.820
I love you. No, he basically just said like, I really like you and it never really happens.

03:26:15.820 --> 03:26:19.500
That's what he said. And I was like, oh, and I thought, Hey, I thought.

03:26:21.260 --> 03:26:24.220
So let's still run. Uh, we said Trump getting banned from Twitter. Is that what we were talking

03:26:24.220 --> 03:26:29.100
about before? Oh yeah. Hey, you agreed to me coming on here. Of course I'm going to be doing

03:26:29.100 --> 03:26:33.100
this. How long, so how long did that take? Two weeks? You said that too, like a week. No,

03:26:33.100 --> 03:26:37.100
I don't know. I think it was just like, the thing is my mind processes, like information so quickly,

03:26:37.100 --> 03:26:42.620
two weeks to somebody like you is actually like years for me. So like me. Yeah. So there was like

03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:47.980
a lot of like factorial type of strategic thinking going on. I was seeing like all the events,

03:26:47.980 --> 03:26:52.220
like Dr. Strange or whatever. And the Avengers, when he's like seeing into all the futures,

03:26:52.220 --> 03:26:58.300
you just saw the future. You're doing like some game theoretic simulation of all the possible

03:26:58.300 --> 03:27:02.940
outcomes. Exactly. Okay. Um, but no, yeah, it was probably pretty soon. I realized that we had a

03:27:02.940 --> 03:27:06.380
lot of chemistry. I think before I left after my two weeks there, I was like, we need to make sure

03:27:06.380 --> 03:27:09.580
you get like a ticket to come visit me in the United States because it'll be fun and everything.

03:27:10.060 --> 03:27:14.460
Kind of decided that last minute too. It was like really like five hours before your flight back.

03:27:14.460 --> 03:27:18.300
We kind of realized because it was kind of like men is just like a one time thing. And then

03:27:18.860 --> 03:27:21.660
that was it. But we were like, oh no, this is a lot of fun. We should probably hang out again.

03:27:21.660 --> 03:27:27.500
Oh, so you realized you would miss each other. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The melancholy side of love.

03:27:27.500 --> 03:27:31.500
Okay. When did you fall in love with Steven? I thought he like hated me. I don't know. I thought

03:27:32.060 --> 03:27:37.900
not hated me. She still thinks I hate her. No, I remember like what he said that he really liked

03:27:37.900 --> 03:27:42.060
me. I was kind of a little shocked about that because I, I don't know, there was a lot of like

03:27:42.060 --> 03:27:45.820
random things happening in New Zealand. It was a lot of fun, but it was definitely like very

03:27:45.820 --> 03:27:50.620
interesting, like things that happen. Um, because I was like around a lot of other people as well.

03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:54.700
So I thought he might've had like a really bad time. Um, but when he said that I was thinking

03:27:54.700 --> 03:27:58.940
about it more and then we spent like more time together, like a week after that. And then I felt

03:27:58.940 --> 03:28:03.180
like that was more like real. And I think when he was about to leave, I kind of realized like,

03:28:03.180 --> 03:28:08.940
no, I really like him. Do you guys ever say love to each other? Like I love you. Yeah, of course.

03:28:08.940 --> 03:28:13.180
Yeah. Okay. All right. I wasn't sure. Why would you ask that? What has he said before? Because I

03:28:13.180 --> 03:28:17.420
haven't, I haven't sure. I don't think I've heard you speak. The only time I've heard Steven talk

03:28:17.420 --> 03:28:22.380
about love is when you're like criticizing the, the Red Pill community saying they don't ever talk

03:28:22.380 --> 03:28:26.460
about love and relationships. Almost all the time I'm giving criticism to people. Like I said,

03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:30.140
I'm kind of stepping in. I'm very disconnected from my own emotional experience because I'm

03:28:30.140 --> 03:28:33.580
trying to talk with them there. So it's pretty rare that I'll talk about. What is your own

03:28:33.580 --> 03:28:38.780
emotional experience? Exactly. Highly blunted. I guess there's a lot. Okay. What does that mean?

03:28:38.780 --> 03:28:43.580
Uh, I mean, what's the, what's deep in there? Are you, are you, is this just who you are genetically

03:28:43.580 --> 03:28:47.100
or are you running from something? I think I have a pretty good understanding of myself. A lot of

03:28:47.100 --> 03:28:51.020
people make that accusation to me, but I don't think I am. Okay. This is just who you are.

03:28:51.020 --> 03:28:55.740
It's just who I am. Yeah. Okay. There's not childhood stuff like trauma. Um, it's all sort

03:28:55.740 --> 03:29:02.060
of done. You figured it all out in your old age. As I grow every year, I figure out more and more.

03:29:02.060 --> 03:29:06.220
He did mention, I think I heard this somewhere that this was a source of fights for the two of

03:29:06.220 --> 03:29:11.820
you. The age thing. I felt the ageism throughout this whole conversation. Um, he's basically,

03:29:11.820 --> 03:29:16.380
he's saying that he gambles like with time. He's just like, I think she will be good later.

03:29:16.380 --> 03:29:20.220
And then just like, it's like an investment. Yeah. Yeah. That's like what he's doing.

03:29:20.220 --> 03:29:24.620
When this treasury bond matures, I'm going to be able to cash out. So far is the stocks going up

03:29:24.620 --> 03:29:30.780
or? Um, it's tumultuous. What's that mean? It's like Bitcoin. Yeah. Like Bitcoin,

03:29:30.780 --> 03:29:36.140
crypto mail. All right. If you guys don't mind, one interesting aspect of your relationship is

03:29:36.140 --> 03:29:41.820
you're in an open relationship. What's that like from a game theoretic simulation perspective?

03:29:41.820 --> 03:29:46.380
What went into that calculation and like, how does that? Like how that started or? Yeah. How

03:29:46.380 --> 03:29:50.780
did that start? Sure. Um, the only relationships I've ever done has been open relationships since

03:29:50.780 --> 03:29:55.180
I was like in high school. Cause I didn't really understand like why wouldn't you be able to like

03:29:55.900 --> 03:29:59.420
do other things for other people, but then just like have your main partner basically.

03:29:59.420 --> 03:30:03.980
So what, what is an open relationship generally speaking? That means you have one main partner.

03:30:03.980 --> 03:30:08.940
Not a monogamous relationship. Like you're somehow allowed like in different ways. Um,

03:30:08.940 --> 03:30:12.940
you can see other people sexually. Sexually, but like there's one main.

03:30:14.460 --> 03:30:18.220
It doesn't have to be there for some people, but like I think it's probably easier and we

03:30:18.220 --> 03:30:23.900
probably don't really have time or the energy for like more than like one person to like really

03:30:23.900 --> 03:30:28.700
like. What about like emotional? It's really complicated. There's a lot of complicated stuff

03:30:28.700 --> 03:30:34.380
going on under the hood there. Yeah. Um, I think broadly speaking, you've got like polyamorous

03:30:34.380 --> 03:30:39.100
relationships and you've got like open relationships where polyamorous is like, oh, I've got like three

03:30:39.100 --> 03:30:42.460
different girlfriends and we all hang out or sometimes even live together or three boyfriends,

03:30:42.460 --> 03:30:45.100
whatever. And then you've got like open relationships, which is like, oh, you know,

03:30:45.100 --> 03:30:48.460
like you can basically hook up with other people and then you've got like your main relationship

03:30:48.460 --> 03:30:52.700
and that's it. I think ours is probably somewhere in the middle of that, um, to where like we've got

03:30:52.700 --> 03:30:56.700
like long-term friends, some of them we hook up with and that's kind of how we, yeah, it's a

03:30:56.700 --> 03:31:02.220
delicate dance that explodes every six months on itself. So it does explode. You guys fight over it?

03:31:02.220 --> 03:31:07.500
We fight over some things. Yeah. I think it's mostly because a lot of people can't handle it

03:31:08.060 --> 03:31:12.060
and they, they agree to something and then they realize that we're way too cool and then they get

03:31:12.060 --> 03:31:15.660
really obsessed and they think that they can like get in there and then it gets really dramatic.

03:31:16.300 --> 03:31:21.820
Have you figured it out? Like, um, I feel like we figure out things more and more,

03:31:21.820 --> 03:31:25.900
like when it comes to like, what's a good person for us to hang out and what's not a good person

03:31:25.900 --> 03:31:30.620
for us to hang out with, or like, I probably have more opinions on like who he hangs out with because

03:31:30.620 --> 03:31:36.700
he likes the fucking psychos. Yeah. So you, you like to surround. He likes the nut, like the crazy

03:31:36.700 --> 03:31:40.700
ones, like the baby traps sort of women. That's the, that's the ones. And I don't like that

03:31:40.700 --> 03:31:48.300
because that affects me. That affects your game theory. Right. Uh, you like to surround yourself

03:31:48.300 --> 03:31:53.180
like in general, you've talked about with crazy people. I say crazy and I really shouldn't. It's

03:31:53.180 --> 03:31:58.060
that humorous. It's like, yeah, it's very unstable. Very can be unstable, but people that are very

03:31:58.060 --> 03:32:03.900
unique, like when I meet this person, that's like boring. Yeah. Not boring. Yeah. And you said that

03:32:03.900 --> 03:32:09.020
you're progressively becoming not boring yourself. No, I think I'm pretty stable. I don't let them

03:32:09.020 --> 03:32:13.340
affect me much, but. So you don't think they affect your. No, if I've said that, I've said it jokingly.

03:32:13.340 --> 03:32:16.700
I think I've like, I've got my stuff like really well figured out. It's what allows me to engage

03:32:16.700 --> 03:32:20.220
with people like this so easily because I can engage, I can make them feel seen and heard.

03:32:20.220 --> 03:32:24.140
And then if it gets insane, I can cut off and I can be chill. Like very few things affect me

03:32:24.140 --> 03:32:29.260
in the longterm. Do you guys experience jealousy? Usually, like whenever I feel like he's not

03:32:29.260 --> 03:32:33.980
spending the, like the amount of time that I'm asking for and he spends it on his video games

03:32:33.980 --> 03:32:38.700
or his stream or like he sees someone else like more than he sees me or something like that,

03:32:38.700 --> 03:32:42.700
that would like not be good because then it affects like our relationship. Do you have a

03:32:42.700 --> 03:32:50.700
good sense of like, is it literally time or is it the energy put into the. It's probably like if,

03:32:50.700 --> 03:32:54.620
like if he's with me, that like the attention in the time, like when he hangs out with me,

03:32:54.620 --> 03:32:58.460
and then there's also probably the time. So if I feel like something else is distracting too much,

03:32:58.460 --> 03:33:02.540
like it could be work or it could be a friend or it could be anything. Like if I feel like it

03:33:02.540 --> 03:33:07.660
starts to take away from like me, then I'm having an issue with it. I don't think he really cares

03:33:07.660 --> 03:33:13.420
much. I guess the only jealousy you experience is probably when you feel like, like if I get upset

03:33:13.420 --> 03:33:18.540
about him seeing someone too much and then I go see someone more and then he's like, why can I go

03:33:18.540 --> 03:33:22.620
see my friend more like as much as you. So like, that's the sort of like thing that we're trying

03:33:22.620 --> 03:33:29.020
to navigate on, I guess. I think we are like diametrically opposed sometimes in terms of how

03:33:29.020 --> 03:33:33.340
we view like engagement with people or engagement with the world sometimes. So like on her end of

03:33:33.340 --> 03:33:40.780
the spectrum, like a perfect week for her might be like being in a cabin, watching like fireflies

03:33:40.780 --> 03:33:44.780
at night, going hiking every morning, going swimming at the beach, because it's like you're

03:33:44.780 --> 03:33:48.860
taking in like the grandeur of nature. You're like connected with yourself. You're like very at peace.

03:33:48.860 --> 03:33:51.980
Everything is like chill and cool. There's the wind, the feeling of nature, everything. That's

03:33:51.980 --> 03:33:56.700
like her peak living experiences. I like being present. Yeah. And like my peak experiences are

03:33:56.700 --> 03:34:00.380
like people trying to destroy my life, like the challenge of like navigating really complicated

03:34:00.380 --> 03:34:04.620
discussion. Like, you know, several different dramatic events unfolding that might end my

03:34:04.620 --> 03:34:08.140
career. Like these things are like very, I like the stress and the action and the entertainment

03:34:08.140 --> 03:34:11.980
and everything's like very cool for me. So when we're together, she generally wants me to be like

03:34:11.980 --> 03:34:15.980
more chill. But if I don't feel like I'm being like stimulated a lot, then it's easy for like

03:34:15.980 --> 03:34:19.420
my mind to wander. To wander somewhere else. That's kind of the issue. Yeah. We have a very

03:34:19.420 --> 03:34:23.980
different way of like engaging with the world. So how can you find happiness in the stillness?

03:34:23.980 --> 03:34:28.140
I feel like if we're just like aware of it and we're trying our best, like whenever we like,

03:34:28.140 --> 03:34:31.260
we're supposed to do this one thing. So let's say that we want to go to New York and I'm like,

03:34:31.260 --> 03:34:34.460
we should just like go out and do this one specific thing. We try to find something

03:34:34.460 --> 03:34:39.500
that he enjoys doing. Like now that we're in Texas, we can go shooting or do something fun

03:34:39.500 --> 03:34:45.580
that he enjoys, then we can do it. And then I think like, just like for me also to be aware

03:34:46.380 --> 03:34:49.980
that like when he spends a lot of time on crazy people, it's not because he like loves them or

03:34:49.980 --> 03:34:55.420
wants to be with them. It's just because he likes having his life destroyed. Like you said,

03:34:55.420 --> 03:34:59.340
which I don't really do. So it's a completely different thing. So like for me to like understand

03:34:59.340 --> 03:35:03.340
more like how he's thinking, because it's so different from mine. And for him to understand

03:35:03.340 --> 03:35:07.260
how I'm thinking about things and like what I prioritize in my life, I think that's like how

03:35:07.260 --> 03:35:11.340
we navigate. But I think it's good. I think the differences can be good. Like when we're finding

03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:15.340
a way. Yeah. Well, I think you're, you're relatable.

03:35:17.100 --> 03:35:20.780
More of a human. I'm definitely very difficult to get along with. Like I always tell people that,

03:35:20.780 --> 03:35:23.980
if you're dating me for like more than a few years, like you get like an award. It's like a

03:35:23.980 --> 03:35:29.180
war zone that you've survived. Absolutely. You're like a veteran, you get medals and stuff.

03:35:29.180 --> 03:35:31.980
And it's always like, I think there's probably been like six different, I don't think she says

03:35:31.980 --> 03:35:34.460
it anymore, but there are like six different times in our relationship where she's like,

03:35:34.460 --> 03:35:38.060
is it always like this? Is this actually, and like every next year it's like.

03:35:38.060 --> 03:35:44.620
You were lying about that. You were like, nah, it's just like right now I'm having

03:35:44.620 --> 03:35:48.380
a huge argument online about saying the N word in private and it's just going to be like this

03:35:48.380 --> 03:35:52.860
and I'm going to be streaming 24 hours a day. And I'm like, when are you going to go to bed?

03:35:52.860 --> 03:35:59.820
It's been a week. I did playing league comment into this a little bit, but I'm clean. I'm clean

03:35:59.820 --> 03:36:04.140
of league like six months right now. What do you hate about legal? I never got humans.

03:36:06.140 --> 03:36:11.100
Well, speaking of which I, my participation in league involved on the robot side. Good.

03:36:11.100 --> 03:36:18.060
Cause that's, that's an improvement. Cause both with Starcraft two and, and legal legends,

03:36:18.060 --> 03:36:22.220
cause open AI and deep mind both participate in creating bots in those.

03:36:22.220 --> 03:36:25.740
I was a professional soccer of two players. So I remember when the AI started to play,

03:36:25.740 --> 03:36:29.580
it's interesting. The types of restrictions that you would have to put on like a gaming robot to

03:36:29.580 --> 03:36:34.540
make it like functional and not totally unfair to the other side. Yeah. To make it human-like.

03:36:34.540 --> 03:36:38.540
Yeah. Was that interesting to you to see AI be able to play those video games?

03:36:38.540 --> 03:36:41.660
I think in some ways people think things are more complicated than they actually are.

03:36:41.660 --> 03:36:44.460
And I think video games is one of those things where we're like, oh my God, there's like a

03:36:44.460 --> 03:36:48.140
million possibilities at every second. And who knows? And it's like, no, there's like three or

03:36:48.140 --> 03:36:51.180
four things going on at any point in time. And I'm willing to bet that like an AI could probably

03:36:51.180 --> 03:36:55.260
solve some of these games like pretty easily. Especially if there are no constraints on how

03:36:55.260 --> 03:37:00.300
they can learn. Yeah. Can I talk to you about relationships? Yeah, we already have some. Yeah,

03:37:00.300 --> 03:37:05.660
I know. But more generally speaking, we didn't get a chance to talk about the red pill community.

03:37:05.660 --> 03:37:09.580
Oh, sure. Well, first of all, what is the red pill community, the metaphor in general?

03:37:09.580 --> 03:37:14.940
I'd love to get both of your opinions on this. Sure. I know you're probably not as

03:37:15.820 --> 03:37:20.060
opinionated on that whole. I'd say. Do you think I am? Like probably not as you,

03:37:20.060 --> 03:37:24.620
like as much as you, but I do have opinions. You do? Okay. I usually don't like speak out too

03:37:24.620 --> 03:37:28.540
much on it because I feel like there's like a language barrier. That's why I don't really

03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:33.180
do politics because this is my second language. Yeah. That's right. You have to know the-

03:37:33.180 --> 03:37:37.500
A little bit like that, yeah. You know how to use, have to use derogatory terms every other

03:37:37.500 --> 03:37:41.500
sentence so they understand you, right? Exactly. I don't know anything about that.

03:37:43.180 --> 03:37:46.940
You need to be able to like speak really well for people to take you seriously,

03:37:47.500 --> 03:37:52.060
I think. And like that's a thing. Like if I don't have like the words and I don't have the,

03:37:52.060 --> 03:37:54.620
like I can't pronounce things correctly, then people are not going to say- Yeah, and I guess

03:37:54.620 --> 03:37:58.380
all persons searching for words look stupid, essentially. That's how people view it. Tell

03:37:58.380 --> 03:38:04.060
me about it. I have a podcast that a bunch of people listen to and I mumble and they, yeah.

03:38:04.140 --> 03:38:09.420
Wait, what's your first language? Russian. Oh, okay. But I speak both languages horribly.

03:38:09.420 --> 03:38:16.220
I'm just not, I'm not like, there is definitely a big disconnect between my brain and my mouth

03:38:16.220 --> 03:38:21.820
module. Like I'm not able to generate the thoughts efficiently. Like the things you're able to do,

03:38:21.820 --> 03:38:26.700
like da-da-da-da-da-da, like speak like that, I'm not. It's very, very tough. Plus there's

03:38:26.700 --> 03:38:30.780
huge amount of anxiety and social interaction that I have, which makes speaking even harder.

03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:37.420
Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's tough. I understand. Gotcha. Make sense. Yeah.

03:38:38.220 --> 03:38:44.540
The, the gotcha is both a symbol of compassion and derision at once. I'm just letting you know,

03:38:44.540 --> 03:38:46.860
I understand what you're saying. I'm just going to sit there and stare at you and-

03:38:46.860 --> 03:38:51.660
Confirm. No, you can just say like, yeah, I get it. Like, yeah. I get it. Gotcha. No, no, got you.

03:38:51.660 --> 03:38:57.740
I got you. Gotcha. No, it's so, it's so short. I got you. It's like say, say a longer sentence,

03:38:57.740 --> 03:39:03.500
but that means the same thing. I understand you. Yeah. That's good. That's like, not chills,

03:39:03.500 --> 03:39:08.700
you know, you get chills. Yeah. You understand me. Yeah. It feels good. Yeah. I hear you. I hear

03:39:08.700 --> 03:39:12.060
you. And like, if you just like hold the other person's hand, that's even better. You got to

03:39:12.060 --> 03:39:16.940
put in some emotion there. Okay. Show that you have some. I understand. What do you think about?

03:39:17.740 --> 03:39:22.220
Gotcha. What do you think about Red Pill? Uh, what, uh, sorry. What, what is it first of all,

03:39:22.220 --> 03:39:26.380
for people? I don't know. Yeah. The Red Pill community, obviously it's the matrix reference.

03:39:26.380 --> 03:39:30.700
The Red Pill that you take is when you realize what dating standards and norms really are in the

03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:36.220
world, that men are providers and have to become some great thing to hunt and attract, you know,

03:39:36.220 --> 03:39:39.420
the woman who are just kind of there floating around looking for people to give them the most

03:39:39.420 --> 03:39:44.220
resources. And it's like coming to a realization of what the world of dating really is broken away

03:39:44.220 --> 03:39:47.580
from the Hollywood standards and the romantic stuff that they try to sell you and, you know,

03:39:47.580 --> 03:39:52.860
stories. So there was kind of, maybe you can kind of educate me on this, but Red Pill used to be

03:39:52.860 --> 03:40:00.300
associated with just, um, maybe anti-establishment use. I don't know. Maybe, maybe Republican

03:40:00.300 --> 03:40:04.620
conservative viewpoints, right? Yeah. They use Red Pill a lot in like different communities. Like

03:40:04.620 --> 03:40:08.460
when you say the Red Pill community, that's usually means dating, the dating thing. But a

03:40:08.460 --> 03:40:11.660
lot of people say, Oh, Trump voters, they're Red Pilled. Are you Red Pilled on like politics or

03:40:11.660 --> 03:40:15.900
people say stuff like that? Yeah. Okay. Cool. And then there's like the Manosphere. That's all the

03:40:15.900 --> 03:40:21.660
similar type of stuff. And Andrew Tate is somebody that represents kind of the figurehead of the

03:40:21.660 --> 03:40:25.820
Manosphere of like the Red Pill stuff. Yeah, I would say so. I'm pretty sure. Okay. All right.

03:40:25.820 --> 03:40:31.020
Cool. So what are some ideas that they represent and what do you think about them? I think they

03:40:31.020 --> 03:40:35.660
do a good job at speaking to disaffected young men who feel like the rest of the world has kind

03:40:35.660 --> 03:40:40.620
of left them behind or isn't willing to speak to them. And they do identify some true and real

03:40:40.620 --> 03:40:44.700
problems. It feels like on the left, we have a really hard time doing like self-improvement

03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:48.380
or telling people how to better themselves. We focus too much on like structural or systemic

03:40:48.380 --> 03:40:52.780
issues rather than what can an individual do to uplift or empower themselves. And it also feels

03:40:52.780 --> 03:40:57.340
like they do a good job at speaking to some of the positive aspects of masculinity, that it's

03:40:57.340 --> 03:41:02.540
okay to be like strong and brave and a soldier and a warrior and provide for your family and blah,

03:41:02.540 --> 03:41:06.220
blah, blah. So I would say like those are like positive messages, like self-improvement and

03:41:06.220 --> 03:41:12.540
everything that come from the Red Pill community. What's the negative? I think the analysis on

03:41:12.540 --> 03:41:17.340
how men and women interact is a way too transactional. All of like the romanticism

03:41:17.340 --> 03:41:21.900
and love and chemistry is totally sucked out of it. Everything is very like sex-based,

03:41:21.900 --> 03:41:25.180
like how do you basically have sex with the most amount of women possible and that's going to make

03:41:25.180 --> 03:41:30.540
you happy. And then I think people's motivation sometimes are just spoken about in such a shallow

03:41:30.540 --> 03:41:34.540
derogatory way that I don't think is always reflective of reality. Like a woman only wants

03:41:34.540 --> 03:41:37.740
you because you make six figures and you're tall and a guy only wants you because he wants to have

03:41:37.740 --> 03:41:42.700
sex with you and blah. Like it feels like there's a lot of that going on a lot. Yeah and that misses

03:41:42.700 --> 03:41:46.940
some fundamental aspects about relationships, about meaningful relationships and so on.

03:41:47.340 --> 03:41:51.100
I've never heard Red Pill people ever, ever talk about like meaningful relationships. It's always

03:41:51.100 --> 03:41:57.100
just how to get in one or how to have sex really. Mel, what bothers you about some of that philosophy?

03:41:57.100 --> 03:42:01.420
I feel like the people that are like the Red Pill people, I feel like their solution is something

03:42:01.420 --> 03:42:07.180
that doesn't actually work out. Like where it works out for some people, people that makes a

03:42:07.180 --> 03:42:12.380
lot of money is like really successful in that sort of way. But it's not going to help most men

03:42:12.380 --> 03:42:16.460
out there. So I feel like it's just like a pointless like speech to give to these

03:42:16.460 --> 03:42:20.940
like really lost guys. And they really do believe that they can like, they can become successful,

03:42:20.940 --> 03:42:25.980
they can get money and like when they get all these things, they can get girls. But

03:42:25.980 --> 03:42:30.300
most of them is not going to achieve that ever. To get the money part or become successful.

03:42:30.300 --> 03:42:33.500
Just become a billionaire, you know, like and you'll get all the girls and which is true,

03:42:33.500 --> 03:42:37.900
but not everyone can do that. So I feel like when these guys are speaking to these men and

03:42:37.900 --> 03:42:41.500
there's like, we just care about these men out there, you know, they need to hear this.

03:42:41.500 --> 03:42:47.820
It doesn't really help a lot of them. And it doesn't inspire them to develop compassion

03:42:48.620 --> 03:42:52.140
towards the opposite sex, which is probably something required to have a meaningful

03:42:52.140 --> 03:42:58.060
relationship. And also like they seem to complain a lot about women. Like only wanting men that

03:42:58.060 --> 03:43:03.740
have money and that's tall and that's muscular, whatever, you know, all those things. But they

03:43:03.740 --> 03:43:09.340
complain about that. But that's like also kind of what they're trying to make the men try to do for

03:43:09.340 --> 03:43:13.500
themselves. So they kind of like falling to the same sort of behavior and it seems like they're

03:43:13.500 --> 03:43:18.140
kind of unaware of that as well. They're just playing a part of the game instead of trying to

03:43:18.140 --> 03:43:24.060
find a woman that doesn't look for those things and that are looking for not those things. Yeah.

03:43:24.060 --> 03:43:31.500
I actually would love to have like straight up data on people in that world versus not in that

03:43:31.500 --> 03:43:41.340
world how often they get laid. Like literally, so I think for sure people in that world have

03:43:41.340 --> 03:43:47.340
fewer meaningful long-term relationships that are fulfilling, that actually help them succeed in life,

03:43:47.340 --> 03:43:51.740
that helps them be happy and content and all that kind of stuff. But just even the straight up,

03:43:51.740 --> 03:43:59.260
the shallow goal of getting laid, I wonder because it's very possible that like just the roughness

03:43:59.260 --> 03:44:06.540
with which they treat intellectually women, that might lead to lower success, not higher success.

03:44:06.540 --> 03:44:10.060
It's very adversarial, which I think is always disappointing. Anything that talks about men and

03:44:10.060 --> 03:44:14.460
women, I think it's good to acknowledge differences. But when it becomes adversarial, especially when

03:44:14.460 --> 03:44:18.060
you talk about sex, sex is something that men are getting and it's something that women are giving

03:44:18.060 --> 03:44:21.340
and that type of like trade-off and the way they talk about it is like, yeah, it sets people

03:44:21.340 --> 03:44:27.020
against each other in a really toxic way, I think. How do you talk to people from that world,

03:44:27.020 --> 03:44:30.860
from the red pill world? Would you ever talk to somebody like Andrew Tate?

03:44:30.860 --> 03:44:34.300
Oh, yeah, if I had the chance to. I've been on the Fresh and Fit podcast a few times and then

03:44:34.300 --> 03:44:40.380
I've got a friend, Sneako, who's like very red pill, that stuff. If I'm trying to talk to them,

03:44:40.380 --> 03:44:44.860
usually it's kind of like approaching it like a scared cat. The first thing you have to do is

03:44:44.860 --> 03:44:49.020
be very gentle and say, I understand your issues, I understand your complaints, I know that I'm scary

03:44:49.020 --> 03:44:53.260
because you think I'm going to say toxic masculinity and feminism and all these scary words at you.

03:44:53.820 --> 03:44:57.900
So the first thing is always to recognize that a lot of what they talk about, there are true

03:44:57.900 --> 03:45:01.820
aspects to what they're talking about that people on the left won't recognize. So I think it's good

03:45:01.820 --> 03:45:06.380
to acknowledge those things that men and women are kind of different. We do look for different

03:45:06.380 --> 03:45:10.300
things in general when it comes to relationships. It's okay to say that, there's nothing bad there.

03:45:10.300 --> 03:45:14.460
And then it'll usually be like, once I've got your trust and I'm in your bubble, let's talk about the

03:45:14.460 --> 03:45:18.540
things that you want and maybe some of the strategies that you're employing aren't necessarily

03:45:18.540 --> 03:45:21.420
going to get you some of the things that you want. So for instance, if you're really worried

03:45:21.420 --> 03:45:26.220
about shallow girls ruining your life, like Malina said, it's probably not best to build

03:45:26.220 --> 03:45:29.500
your entire worldview around trying to get shallow girls that are going to ruin your life.

03:45:29.500 --> 03:45:33.500
If your way of attracting a girl is to go to the gym, get a whole bunch of money and try to flaunt

03:45:33.500 --> 03:45:36.300
your wealth as much as possible, you're going to be attracting the very same type of women that

03:45:36.300 --> 03:45:40.700
you're here decrying on your stream. I think we talked about that on the podcast. You probably

03:45:40.700 --> 03:45:44.780
want to have a woman that's going to be there if you lose your job, but still there. That cares

03:45:44.780 --> 03:45:51.020
about the things that's not just your job. It's more stable. And also I don't help you become

03:45:51.020 --> 03:45:57.660
a great man or grow. I feel like a great friendship and a partnership. It helps you

03:45:57.660 --> 03:46:01.340
make you a better person. Some of the most successful people I know, they have families

03:46:01.340 --> 03:46:06.300
and there's clearly a dynamic there that makes them, they wouldn't be that without-

03:46:06.300 --> 03:46:07.340
They're not an island, yeah.

03:46:07.340 --> 03:46:12.700
Yeah. And the kids actually are a big part of that too. For most people, if you're a good parent,

03:46:12.700 --> 03:46:16.620
they make you step up somehow in life. You have to take responsibility for

03:46:17.340 --> 03:46:23.660
getting your shit together and excelling in ways that I guess the philosophy of the red

03:46:23.660 --> 03:46:24.940
pole does not quite get to.

03:46:24.940 --> 03:46:27.820
That's always an interesting, I think I've asked that a couple of times where it's like,

03:46:27.820 --> 03:46:33.020
would you let your daughter date Andrew Tate? And it's always funny to watch them kind of like

03:46:33.020 --> 03:46:35.100
squirm around those answers sometimes.

03:46:35.100 --> 03:46:40.220
But see, if they don't have a daughter, I don't have a daughter. I think your

03:46:40.220 --> 03:46:42.220
whole philosophy changes once you have a daughter.

03:46:42.220 --> 03:46:46.140
Sure. Well, but even at that, they know that what they're answering, they feel a little bit

03:46:46.140 --> 03:46:49.740
weird about it. It's funny to watch them. Like they even, they know it's like, ah, fuck it.

03:46:49.740 --> 03:46:54.940
Well, they might say like, I want my daughter to date like a high value male to the degree

03:46:54.940 --> 03:46:59.500
that he's a high value male. Yes. But like, I don't think you'll feel that way. The definition

03:46:59.500 --> 03:47:05.660
of high value changes completely. Certainly the stereotypical measures of value contribute

03:47:05.660 --> 03:47:09.660
to the calculation, but it's so much more than that. I think the chemistry of the whole thing

03:47:09.660 --> 03:47:16.060
is bigger. You've also mentioned about body count. You guys both have a high body

03:47:16.060 --> 03:47:21.500
count. Does body count matter? Or it depends. Like you said, it's low in some people's eyes.

03:47:21.500 --> 03:47:25.740
It's high in other people's eyes. Does body count matter in relationships? Does the past matter?

03:47:26.540 --> 03:47:30.700
Well, the past matters. I don't think body count. Not to me. I don't really care. Not just as it is.

03:47:30.700 --> 03:47:35.900
No. I mean, it could be. The past does. Yeah. Well, the past is who you are, right?

03:47:35.900 --> 03:47:39.180
Like somebody tells me like they have a 200 body count and they're 16.

03:47:39.180 --> 03:47:42.300
Something's probably going on there that's not good. I was thinking about that too. Like,

03:47:42.460 --> 03:47:45.980
there could be like really young people that are having some sort of like mental

03:47:45.980 --> 03:47:50.380
problems going on. Or somebody's like 45 and they've like never had sex before. There's

03:47:50.380 --> 03:47:53.500
probably something going on, right? So it could be indicative. But if somebody's like in their 20s

03:47:53.500 --> 03:47:56.460
and they've had sex with, you know, a hundred people or 50 people or whatever, it's, you know,

03:47:56.460 --> 03:48:02.300
whatever. It's more experience, which can be good. Sure. Okay. So that just represents you're like

03:48:02.300 --> 03:48:07.740
sexually open. And so it doesn't really necessarily mean any kind of- Not necessarily. It could though.

03:48:07.740 --> 03:48:12.700
The number alone doesn't mean anything. Yeah. Okay. Well, you could meet a guy that's like,

03:48:12.700 --> 03:48:16.140
I just really, really like when I fuck a lot of people because it makes me so cool.

03:48:16.140 --> 03:48:19.740
Like you can meet someone like that, which is like- So the body count doesn't matter,

03:48:19.740 --> 03:48:23.820
but like where it comes from. Yeah. Like why have you slept with the people you slept with?

03:48:24.460 --> 03:48:27.820
Does it hurt like the romantic aspect of the relationship knowing that there's a lot of

03:48:27.820 --> 03:48:33.180
people in the past? Not for us. No. Is the part of the relationship fundamentally romantic?

03:48:33.900 --> 03:48:40.780
For us? Yeah. Okay. What? You come off as such a cold person.

03:48:40.780 --> 03:48:44.060
No, I was just in my head thinking and I wanted to just say, gotcha right there.

03:48:45.740 --> 03:48:49.260
It's so judgmental. I think when it comes to the sex thing, there's always like the way that I

03:48:49.260 --> 03:48:53.980
explain it is, and I understand like, I have to say this because I don't advocate for what I do

03:48:53.980 --> 03:48:57.340
for everybody or what she does for everybody. Cause obviously there's a whole bunch of

03:48:57.340 --> 03:49:01.260
natural feelings of jealousy that pop up for a lot of people. But when people ask me, you know,

03:49:01.260 --> 03:49:04.220
it's always like, oh, like, isn't this like horrible that you guys are doing this and

03:49:04.220 --> 03:49:08.780
you don't love each other? From my perspective, I can have sex with like any person and it can

03:49:08.780 --> 03:49:12.460
be sex. Like that's not like a special thing between two people in my eyes. It's like anybody

03:49:12.460 --> 03:49:17.260
can have sex, but there are like certain activities and ways that you can spend time with each other

03:49:17.260 --> 03:49:20.620
where you're like carving out these like precious little moments in time with a certain person that

03:49:20.620 --> 03:49:24.380
can do things that are special to that person. And those are the kind of like events that I

03:49:24.380 --> 03:49:29.500
remember more than anything else. So like the idea of like, oh wow, I had sex with a person

03:49:29.500 --> 03:49:34.140
that was so special. It doesn't mean as much as like, you know, us traveling to like New Zealand

03:49:34.140 --> 03:49:37.900
or sharing some special moment, doing like some really fun activity or event or whatever. That's

03:49:37.900 --> 03:49:43.340
usually how I like it. So a shared intimate moment. Yeah. I kind of agree, but I can definitely

03:49:43.340 --> 03:49:47.020
connect the romance with sex. Boring. I'm curious why you can't do that. That's because she's a

03:49:47.020 --> 03:49:50.700
woman. See, that's where the red pill's right. That's exactly what I'm saying. We've also talked

03:49:50.700 --> 03:49:56.300
about misogyny, which is clearly the embodiment of that. What were you saying? So there's some,

03:49:56.300 --> 03:50:00.460
there's a connection between romance and- Yeah, I think it is because I think sex could be a lot

03:50:00.460 --> 03:50:08.780
of things, right? It's some sort of bonding, I'd say in some way. They say that you really like BDSM.

03:50:08.780 --> 03:50:13.100
You kind of like, you become submissive to someone or you take control over someone. It's like in a

03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:18.300
very bonding, like intimate moment, I'd say. And that's romantic. The intimacy is romantic.

03:50:18.300 --> 03:50:22.700
I think it is. If you can show yourself as really submissive or like weak or you have like absolutely

03:50:22.700 --> 03:50:27.020
no control over yourself and you let someone else do it, or you are the one being that like

03:50:27.020 --> 03:50:31.340
you are the dominant for someone. I think that's a really like intimate thing because you show

03:50:31.340 --> 03:50:35.340
like the weakest part of yourself, kind of. I just feel like I personally,

03:50:37.820 --> 03:50:41.500
to me, some component of romantic, but to me, this is not judging to others. To me,

03:50:41.500 --> 03:50:49.260
maybe it's how I was brought up. The romance increases if the number of intimate interactions

03:50:49.980 --> 03:50:55.980
are limited to one person. For me, for some reason, spreading it out

03:50:57.660 --> 03:51:07.180
decreases exponentially the feeling of romance you feel. That could be just like sort of having

03:51:07.180 --> 03:51:13.100
grown up in the Soviet Union. There's the fairy tale stories and you're kind of maybe living

03:51:13.100 --> 03:51:17.180
through them. Yeah, I mean, I think what you're saying is really normal. Most people probably

03:51:17.180 --> 03:51:21.420
feel that way, yeah. But because you guys are able to successfully not do that, I just

03:51:22.380 --> 03:51:28.060
want to question my own understanding of it. Why is that? Why is that? Am I being very

03:51:29.100 --> 03:51:34.220
jealous for no reason? Maybe you can maximize the number of intimate experiences if you just

03:51:34.220 --> 03:51:39.180
open up and let go of the jealousy, essentially. I feel like in Sweden and in Scandinavia, we're

03:51:39.180 --> 03:51:45.660
extremely just sexually open. In general, we're not super religious either. We're very relaxed.

03:51:46.460 --> 03:51:51.100
We don't feel bad about ourselves. It's just a different sort of thing and I would say we're

03:51:51.100 --> 03:51:55.820
more progressive when it comes to feminism and stuff. It's more common that you will meet women

03:51:55.820 --> 03:52:00.540
with a higher body count than when I meet American girls. All of them have vaginismus,

03:52:00.540 --> 03:52:04.220
super-suppressed sexually. What did you just use?

03:52:04.220 --> 03:52:08.620
They have issues. They can't relax during sex, so it just hurts for them.

03:52:08.620 --> 03:52:10.620
Vaginismus. Vaginismus, isn't that what it's

03:52:10.620 --> 03:52:17.100
called? Yeah. I meet so many girls that are having a lot of issues with sex and they have

03:52:17.100 --> 03:52:23.420
a very low body count because they just can't relax. Usually, they come from a very religious

03:52:23.420 --> 03:52:27.820
background, so they have just been told you cannot wear that. You cannot be like that.

03:52:30.220 --> 03:52:34.140
Where I grew up, it wasn't like that at all. We just see it as more like a casual thing.

03:52:35.180 --> 03:52:39.740
Then you can just maximize the awesomeness of the experience.

03:52:40.060 --> 03:52:41.820
I guess I don't have a problem with it. Exactly.

03:52:42.620 --> 03:52:45.900
The important thing I think for everybody to realize is there's always pros and cons to

03:52:45.900 --> 03:52:51.180
everything. My lifestyle, obviously I get to have a lot of fun experiences. That's a huge pro and

03:52:51.180 --> 03:52:55.580
that's super cool. If you're a more monogamy-brained person, you're not going to get those experiences.

03:52:55.580 --> 03:52:58.940
But if you're a monogamy-brained person, when you're sharing that special moment in time with

03:52:58.940 --> 03:53:02.860
somebody else, that moment can be really, really, really special because now it's the thing that

03:53:02.860 --> 03:53:06.060
you're showing yourself and opening yourself up to another person and they're only trusting you

03:53:06.060 --> 03:53:09.660
to do that. That's a really special thing that only the two of you are sharing with each other.

03:53:10.300 --> 03:53:14.300
There's always pros and cons to everything. I think we both would say that doing an open

03:53:14.300 --> 03:53:18.780
relationship is probably not ... We would not recommend it. I don't think we would, no.

03:53:19.900 --> 03:53:24.460
Yeah, I recently fasted for three days and then ate a chicken breast at the end of that and it

03:53:24.460 --> 03:53:30.220
was the most delicious food I've ever eaten. There's some aspect of fasting and scarcity

03:53:30.220 --> 03:53:34.380
and so on that you have to figure out for your own psyche what works the best.

03:53:34.380 --> 03:53:38.940
It's good to be a little bored or not do something or work because you can just enjoy

03:53:38.940 --> 03:53:42.380
the time when you're doing something really fun is more fun. Otherwise, you're just going to get

03:53:42.380 --> 03:53:46.220
numb in general with everything. Yeah. Yeah, I personally just never get bored.

03:53:46.940 --> 03:53:53.900
I guess the boring thing is exciting to me. You're like me because everything I like is boring.

03:53:54.780 --> 03:53:59.100
I got to ask you, we talked about misogyny and he's trying to battle it out on the internet.

03:53:59.660 --> 03:54:06.060
What's your sense as a woman about the level of misogyny and the internet

03:54:06.140 --> 03:54:12.060
in the streaming community and how to fight it? For me, because I guess I get it every single day

03:54:12.060 --> 03:54:19.100
somehow because I have a chat that's live, right? But I have mods moderating that all the time so

03:54:19.100 --> 03:54:24.060
I don't really need to see much of it. I think it's just pretty annoying because you get to see it

03:54:24.060 --> 03:54:27.500
all the time. Does it become background noise?

03:54:28.220 --> 03:54:33.340
Yeah, a little bit and it's the same comments over and over again. But it's usually for me,

03:54:33.340 --> 03:54:36.860
I don't personally care that much. I understand that other people do, especially when it comes

03:54:36.860 --> 03:54:42.940
into when there's a lot of sexism and stuff and when there's a lot of men not taking women

03:54:42.940 --> 03:54:47.740
seriously. I definitely get that and I used to get that even more a few years ago with my accent

03:54:47.740 --> 03:54:51.580
and everything. I used to be blonde as well a few months ago. I feel like people wouldn't take me

03:54:51.580 --> 03:54:57.740
seriously because of that. That's a bit annoying, but I feel like it's pretty easy to see through

03:54:57.740 --> 03:55:02.860
when someone acts that way. For me personally, I don't really care, but it's a bit annoying

03:55:02.860 --> 03:55:07.580
being online and getting stuff every single day. I would say probably the worst thing is

03:55:08.380 --> 03:55:13.420
when you feel like you put in a lot of effort into some sort of work, everyone is just going to say,

03:55:13.420 --> 03:55:18.540
you just got that because you're a woman and you're attractive. That's probably the worst thing.

03:55:18.540 --> 03:55:20.380
Is there a way to fight that, you think?

03:55:20.380 --> 03:55:24.380
Yeah, I don't think you can. I think it just comes up all the time. It is what it is,

03:55:24.380 --> 03:55:28.780
I guess. You just got to keep doing whatever you do and not let it emotionally control you somehow.

03:55:28.780 --> 03:55:30.860
I think having more women in those spaces is always good.

03:55:30.860 --> 03:55:31.820
It's probably good, yeah.

03:55:31.820 --> 03:55:33.340
A lot of the guys, you can tell online that they don't ever-

03:55:33.340 --> 03:55:35.660
Don't bring on the worst ones then, Steven.

03:55:35.660 --> 03:55:38.700
See, she just did it. She did the misogyny thing.

03:55:39.500 --> 03:55:42.220
By having some bad women on, she's saying all women, see?

03:55:42.220 --> 03:55:45.580
Well, you know it's true, right?

03:55:46.540 --> 03:55:50.140
I disagree with you and I'm older than both of you and therefore wiser, right?

03:55:50.780 --> 03:55:52.620
Well combined, we're older than you, so be careful.

03:55:53.500 --> 03:55:56.140
We're one only matronomy. Yeah, we've got combined age.

03:55:57.820 --> 03:56:01.740
It could be the same thing as also the age thing and the woman thing. A lot of people

03:56:01.740 --> 03:56:03.980
think that I'm just copying every single thing that he says,

03:56:03.980 --> 03:56:06.380
which I think is a bit annoying as well, so I can never really like-

03:56:06.380 --> 03:56:07.660
Hassan accused her of that one time.

03:56:07.660 --> 03:56:09.020
Yeah, which is a bit annoying.

03:56:10.380 --> 03:56:12.860
It was about the defending police, like my dad is a cop.

03:56:12.860 --> 03:56:19.180
I like friendship, camaraderie, and love and respect, which you both have had for a time

03:56:19.180 --> 03:56:23.660
and have lost and I would like you to regain it. Let's try to increase, not decrease,

03:56:23.660 --> 03:56:28.140
the amount of love in the space. What do you think about some of the harshness of his language,

03:56:28.140 --> 03:56:34.620
which we talked about? Our word in the past when he used N-word, all of that kind of stuff.

03:56:34.620 --> 03:56:37.980
What he used to do, I mean- No, like what do you think about it?

03:56:37.980 --> 03:56:41.180
Like do you give him advice? To not speak a certain way?

03:56:41.180 --> 03:56:44.780
No, like a little more civility. I'm just trying to get a second opinion on this.

03:56:44.780 --> 03:56:46.220
Second opinion about- Normal people,

03:56:46.220 --> 03:56:48.620
non-internet people are way more extreme than-

03:56:48.620 --> 03:56:50.540
Yeah. She's way more extreme.

03:56:50.540 --> 03:56:53.820
No, that's not true. Okay, so here's the thing for me, okay?

03:56:54.380 --> 03:56:59.900
I was not online until three years ago at all. Like I would watch YouTube. That's pretty much

03:56:59.900 --> 03:57:03.580
all I would do. I wouldn't do anything else, really. I didn't grew up playing video games

03:57:03.580 --> 03:57:10.220
or anything. So I'm like extremely new to everything. So when I came into this world

03:57:10.220 --> 03:57:13.900
and I started seeing clips from him in the past, I don't think I really had much of an

03:57:13.900 --> 03:57:17.180
opinion because it just sounded like it was just a different like words that we're using,

03:57:17.180 --> 03:57:21.500
but it didn't mean anything. That's what it feels. It was just like, if you're saying the R-word,

03:57:21.500 --> 03:57:25.180
it's because you just want to call someone stupid, but you want to like do it a little bit more.

03:57:25.180 --> 03:57:28.940
But it's not like, it didn't feel like it was like a, it's not like racism or like,

03:57:29.820 --> 03:57:32.620
it's not- Agreement on this side here, right?

03:57:32.620 --> 03:57:37.900
So like if he was saying the F-word because it was just like a word to like insult someone and he

03:57:37.900 --> 03:57:41.420
wasn't like, I don't think he was ever, I don't think you were ever homophobic back in the day

03:57:41.420 --> 03:57:45.820
or anything like that. But I think it was just like a way to express yourself maybe back then.

03:57:45.820 --> 03:57:49.020
I don't know. I didn't do it. There's no videos of me or anything because I wasn't even online

03:57:49.020 --> 03:57:55.260
back then. Yeah, so my case was I definitely don't think Steven is homophobic or any of those,

03:57:55.260 --> 03:58:00.140
obviously. So there's a good heart there and a good mind. I was just saying-

03:58:00.140 --> 03:58:04.140
He just likes being mean, I think. Well, there's some, you lose yourself

03:58:04.140 --> 03:58:09.660
and forget the bigger picture that he's pushing for more effective discourse on the internet.

03:58:09.660 --> 03:58:14.140
He's like an inspiration to a lot of people, especially now, of like how you can use effective

03:58:14.140 --> 03:58:19.340
conversation to make for a better world, to radicalize people and so on. And then you lose

03:58:19.340 --> 03:58:26.700
some of that power by losing yourself in like the language, just more language of emotion versus

03:58:27.340 --> 03:58:31.820
effective communication. But it's a gray area. I would say like something that is probably

03:58:31.820 --> 03:58:36.300
recently done in that case, because it's been joking about women a lot. Like it's women's

03:58:36.300 --> 03:58:40.300
fault. They're bad. Like it's just, it's been like a lot of jokes when it comes to misogyny,

03:58:40.300 --> 03:58:44.060
I guess, in your community. And I think it's actually turned people a little bit that way.

03:58:44.060 --> 03:58:45.500
That's why we've done the recent-

03:58:45.500 --> 03:58:49.420
Yes. So I guess that's actually true because I don't think it was pretty,

03:58:49.420 --> 03:58:53.180
I don't think it was clear enough. I don't think it actually was. I think you did that mistake.

03:58:54.380 --> 03:58:58.460
But I think back then I was even saying like, hey, you should probably not, like you probably

03:58:58.460 --> 03:59:02.620
should not do that. Because it actually is pretty hard for me because whenever I come into his

03:59:02.620 --> 03:59:06.300
community, like his chat, people are just going to spam. It's like a woman moment. It's a woman

03:59:06.300 --> 03:59:10.140
moment whenever I say something and it's kind of like, yeah, it's getting pretty annoying. As I

03:59:10.140 --> 03:59:12.220
said, it's just annoying when you see it every single day.

03:59:13.580 --> 03:59:16.220
There you go. Wisdom from somebody younger than you.

03:59:16.940 --> 03:59:21.020
Wisdom can come from all kinds of people. Yeah, of course. Just sometimes in very limited

03:59:21.020 --> 03:59:25.100
quantities. Depends on the age. And learn something from anybody.

03:59:25.100 --> 03:59:28.060
What advice would you give to young people, the both of you?

03:59:29.260 --> 03:59:34.780
That you have both audiences where young people look up to you. In general, if you were to give

03:59:34.780 --> 03:59:40.380
advice to somebody in high school, like how to create a life that you can be proud of,

03:59:40.380 --> 03:59:44.780
what would you say? The most important thing that I've learned

03:59:44.780 --> 03:59:49.580
is to view people as different and not better or worse. And when you view people as different

03:59:49.580 --> 03:59:53.900
instead of better or worse, you learn that there's almost something that you can learn from anybody.

03:59:54.620 --> 03:59:58.940
Like be open and empathetic towards other people's experiences. Nobody does anything by

03:59:58.940 --> 04:00:02.220
random choice. Like there's always reasons why people act the way they do.

04:00:02.220 --> 04:00:06.540
And as long as you're willing to be open and receptive to the lived experiences of other

04:00:06.540 --> 04:00:10.300
people, you're going to be able to gather information and create a more cohesive and

04:00:10.300 --> 04:00:15.900
better view of the world than any of your peers will. Do you have any advice you can give to young

04:00:15.900 --> 04:00:22.140
folks? I feel like something that I see, especially in America a lot, is that a lot of people get told

04:00:22.140 --> 04:00:27.900
what to do early on. Like in high school, they're supposed to become this thing. Education-wise,

04:00:27.900 --> 04:00:31.660
they're supposed to become a doctor or this thing or whatever. And then they give up on

04:00:31.660 --> 04:00:35.740
things that they're actually passionate about. So I think a lot of teenagers get really confused.

04:00:35.740 --> 04:00:40.060
They get an education and then they get that job and they hate everything. And they think that

04:00:41.020 --> 04:00:44.060
when they're reaching the job, when they're reaching the journey, they're going to get happy.

04:00:44.060 --> 04:00:48.060
That's like where the happiness is going to be. But then when they get to there, they just hate

04:00:48.060 --> 04:00:52.460
everything. And then they become really depressed. And I've seen this so much. Like I've seen this

04:00:52.460 --> 04:00:58.380
all the time. And it's pretty sad to me to see so many people that are just wasting time. And then

04:00:58.380 --> 04:01:03.420
they just get really confused. And I don't know. It's the same thing with relationships too. No one

04:01:03.420 --> 04:01:07.580
really knows what they want anymore. I feel like everyone is just kind of doing whatever society is

04:01:07.580 --> 04:01:12.300
saying or their parents are saying or their friends are saying. And they're never really

04:01:12.300 --> 04:01:17.980
doing anything that's super meaningful anymore. So what I would say is try to find something

04:01:18.700 --> 04:01:22.940
that is important to you. It could be anything really. Like some sort of passion, maybe like

04:01:22.940 --> 04:01:27.740
your friends, maybe like what matters to you. Figuring those things out I think is really

04:01:27.740 --> 04:01:31.660
important. And that comes from being able to listen to like some inner voice. So it's not

04:01:31.660 --> 04:01:35.500
going to come from elsewhere. It's really hard because you're living the life and like there's

04:01:35.500 --> 04:01:39.740
things happening around you and people tell you what to do and what not to do. No one really has

04:01:39.740 --> 04:01:45.260
like their own opinions. Everyone is just kind of like listening to the cooler thing or you know.

04:01:45.260 --> 04:01:51.180
Except Steven. He seems to stand in his own trail. Yeah, I'd say so. And like something I realized

04:01:51.180 --> 04:01:55.020
too like because we just went to TwitchCon and we were talking to a lot of streamers. How was that?

04:01:55.980 --> 04:02:01.100
It was interesting. I thought it was interesting because the few people that I feel like that

04:02:01.100 --> 04:02:05.020
seemed really cool and that I look up to like in the streaming world. All of them wants to

04:02:05.020 --> 04:02:09.340
quit streaming. All of them wants to do it. No one wants like no one likes it. And they're so

04:02:09.340 --> 04:02:15.180
successful. Like they are around successful people. They're working every single day.

04:02:15.180 --> 04:02:19.980
They're working hard. They're making so much money. And everyone is just complaining and like

04:02:19.980 --> 04:02:26.140
they're complaining about like not being able to see their partner or you know because they

04:02:26.140 --> 04:02:31.100
need to live somewhere else. And I see these things and they seem extremely unhappy and

04:02:31.100 --> 04:02:35.820
but it's so hard for them to just like cut all this successful stuff off because that's like what

04:02:35.820 --> 04:02:41.180
you you know learn to do. And that's like supposed to be like your happiness but it isn't. Everyone

04:02:41.180 --> 04:02:46.140
is really unhappy. Yeah, there's something about maybe streaming is different but YouTube folks

04:02:46.140 --> 04:02:52.220
too have interacted with a few and even in podcasting space people become obsessed about

04:02:52.220 --> 04:02:58.940
the views and numbers and subscribers and stuff like that. So I turn, I never talk about that.

04:02:58.940 --> 04:03:07.820
I don't pay attention to that. I feel like that's a drug that destroys your mind. Your mind is an

04:03:07.820 --> 04:03:14.380
artist's ability to create truly unique things. Also your mind in terms of the anxiety, the ups

04:03:14.380 --> 04:03:22.620
and downs of the attention mechanism. And then also being just if it's something that you make

04:03:22.620 --> 04:03:28.300
is not popular but it meant a lot to you, you will think of it less because it's not popular.

04:03:28.300 --> 04:03:33.180
That's a really dangerous thing and because everyone around you is reinforcing like I'll

04:03:33.180 --> 04:03:40.860
get messages like wow this thing got this many views or something. Great job. It's like no,

04:03:40.860 --> 04:03:48.860
you don't get it. Everyone is enforcing this language of views and likes and so on

04:03:48.860 --> 04:03:53.820
and it's correlated of course because truly impactful things will get a lot of attention

04:03:53.820 --> 04:04:03.180
often. But it's not, on the individual local scale like temporarily, it can really fuck with

04:04:03.180 --> 04:04:10.300
your mind and I see that in the creators. They become addicts to the algorithm. Lost and chasing

04:04:10.380 --> 04:04:14.780
views. We know friends that we know cool people and they start streaming and eventually they're

04:04:14.780 --> 04:04:21.500
chasing the dragon. And they change. It's hard to engage with them anymore. This is something

04:04:21.500 --> 04:04:26.060
I've always said that one of the biggest blessings and biggest curses of humanity is we are very good

04:04:26.060 --> 04:04:29.660
at acclimating. You can become paralyzed. You can have all sorts of horrible things happen to you

04:04:29.660 --> 04:04:32.540
and you'll get used to it and you'll be okay. You're going to have a good baseline. But it

04:04:32.540 --> 04:04:35.900
works the other way too in that you can get more and more and more and more and you acclimate to

04:04:35.900 --> 04:04:39.820
it almost immediately. There's like this is a phenomenon that I bet it happens in the YouTube

04:04:39.820 --> 04:04:43.580
world but I know what happens in the streaming world where you're streaming 1,000 viewers every

04:04:43.580 --> 04:04:48.620
day. Huge event happens and you blow up and you got like 15,000 viewers for a day or two and then

04:04:48.620 --> 04:04:51.660
it starts to go down and down and down and down and down and down and then after all the drama

04:04:51.660 --> 04:04:57.500
stayed off you're at like 3,000 concurrent viewers. Now in the macro you went from 1,000 to 3,000.

04:04:57.500 --> 04:05:00.780
That feels awesome but you actually feel like shit the whole time because you're remembering

04:05:00.780 --> 04:05:05.260
when you had 10 or 15,000 and now everything feels horrible and you'll see people climb over time

04:05:05.260 --> 04:05:08.620
and like fuck like but whatever that one huge stream I had like I've never like been able to

04:05:08.620 --> 04:05:12.220
and it's like dude you're doing great what's yeah that happens a lot. There's so many people

04:05:12.220 --> 04:05:16.220
that we know that we find super super cool they're passionate about things they have so much

04:05:16.220 --> 04:05:21.260
interest and then they just get like so addicted to these numbers and like all the everything is

04:05:21.260 --> 04:05:24.540
just ruined like all the cool things about them is ruined because they stop doing the things that

04:05:24.540 --> 04:05:29.660
they actually like to do something else that gives them more viewers and more money and it's really

04:05:29.660 --> 04:05:37.500
sad to see. Yeah that temporary sacrifice that seems temporary is that it actually destroys you

04:05:37.500 --> 04:05:42.460
like for one time making a choice because I come across those choices often like I can do this.

04:05:42.460 --> 04:05:47.580
You can kind of know what's going to be popular and not and you have to ask yourself that question

04:05:47.580 --> 04:05:53.420
like is this going to sacrifice? Because if people are sacrificing like intimate relationships they're

04:05:53.420 --> 04:05:57.980
sacrificing time with their family they're like sacrificing time with the things that they feel

04:05:57.980 --> 04:06:03.820
good about and that they like and that's something I kind of realized last year because I was working

04:06:03.820 --> 04:06:07.260
so much and I was just grinding and grinding grinding because it was kind of new for me and

04:06:07.260 --> 04:06:12.380
then new years came by and I was like wait what did I even do like the entire year like I traveled

04:06:12.380 --> 04:06:16.140
to a bunch of places but nothing actually really meant anything to me because I felt like I was

04:06:16.140 --> 04:06:19.660
just working the entire time I felt like I was just numb through the through the entire year I

04:06:19.660 --> 04:06:27.100
was really scary um like I rented a like a super pretty house like for a week with my dad and my

04:06:27.100 --> 04:06:32.700
sister because I wanted to spend time with them but the entire time I was just streaming and I

04:06:32.700 --> 04:06:37.580
actually didn't ever like calm down and just like chill with them and I like that's like time I'll

04:06:37.580 --> 04:06:42.140
never get back I don't I don't give a shit about the money that I made that week but I lost the time

04:06:42.940 --> 04:06:47.820
and like that is really important to me and I yeah and a lot of people are doing that um and

04:06:47.820 --> 04:06:52.380
I feel like you as you said like you can definitely see that in like artists for sure I feel like if

04:06:52.380 --> 04:06:56.940
you look at like artists like back in the 60s or 70s I feel like things were just so much better

04:06:56.940 --> 04:07:01.660
back then and it feels like they were actually making music that meant something to them they

04:07:01.660 --> 04:07:06.460
were actually making art and I feel like today everything is just kind of like whatever is cool

04:07:06.460 --> 04:07:10.940
whatever sells whatever you know sounds in a certain way everything is kind of the same thing

04:07:10.940 --> 04:07:16.460
and everything that is very artistic and very cool is actually not that popular at all and uh

04:07:16.460 --> 04:07:21.180
that's kind of sad I think yeah of course there's now bigger mechanisms and platforms to spread

04:07:21.980 --> 04:07:27.820
stuff music so as long as you could be content with not being popular I think you can still

04:07:28.060 --> 04:07:31.980
yeah but not like when people get a little popular they get addicted to that so fast

04:07:31.980 --> 04:07:37.660
yeah it's weird yeah you have been somewhat good at least from my outside of perspective

04:07:37.660 --> 04:07:43.420
because I think you I can at least imagine you making choices that could make you more popular

04:07:43.420 --> 04:07:51.740
and you don't seem to make those choices but it is very intentional like you said like and I made

04:07:51.740 --> 04:07:56.140
that choice at every single stage of my life one is because from the perspective of being a

04:07:56.140 --> 04:08:00.540
carpet cleaner my life is way better than that was or ever would have been so I'm already doing

04:08:00.540 --> 04:08:06.220
way better than I ever thought somebody like me ever could be but then two I super love my job

04:08:06.220 --> 04:08:09.580
every time I wake up every time I fly to a place to a podcast every time I get to talk to really

04:08:09.580 --> 04:08:12.860
cool people like every single part of my job I super like if there's something I don't like

04:08:12.860 --> 04:08:15.900
I just cut it off because I don't care because I'm already making plenty money doing what I do

04:08:15.900 --> 04:08:19.660
and why would I ever wake up and not like what I'm doing when I can like what I'm doing how do

04:08:19.660 --> 04:08:25.180
you guys find through that given that you love it and sometimes maybe lose yourself from the

04:08:25.180 --> 04:08:29.980
drug of it how do you find like work life balance together inside a relationship

04:08:30.780 --> 04:08:35.900
like time for each other I don't at all so I'm not a good person to ask what do you love more

04:08:35.900 --> 04:08:41.980
uh mel or fact factor is a really good game that's like not a fair comparison okay you're

04:08:41.980 --> 04:08:47.180
talking about one of the best cleanest games best support ever made cleanest code base like yeah

04:08:47.180 --> 04:08:53.420
this is yeah it's more factorial time for me starting to understand where the massaging comes

04:08:53.740 --> 04:08:58.300
by the way is is is the inspector legit a really good game yeah of course yeah okay

04:08:58.300 --> 04:09:02.940
if you're like uh do you enjoy programming of course that's all I do that's all that's okay

04:09:02.940 --> 04:09:07.500
if you've got like uh programming is is the game in itself that I enjoy probably more than anything

04:09:07.500 --> 04:09:11.340
else but yeah it's very much a game like that like if you're into stuff like that like you can lose

04:09:11.340 --> 04:09:16.060
hundreds of hours like very quickly too like you have a problem and then you think of a solution

04:09:16.060 --> 04:09:19.340
and then you iterate on that over and over and over again in larger larger schemes sometimes

04:09:19.340 --> 04:09:22.220
you got to redesign stuff sometimes you're like it's a very much like that kind of game I see

04:09:22.220 --> 04:09:26.060
essentially building a factory like what on a foreign planet or something like that it's

04:09:26.060 --> 04:09:29.260
basically it's like a bunch of you're trying to automate different problems so that you can

04:09:29.260 --> 04:09:32.380
build bigger things so that you can automate bigger problems so you can build bigger things

04:09:32.380 --> 04:09:37.020
automate bigger problems so it's more complicated than like a city building game like some city

04:09:37.020 --> 04:09:41.820
type of thing I wouldn't say it's more complicated it's more like it's like factor is like a game of

04:09:41.820 --> 04:09:46.700
like logic like strictly like logic like it's almost like a building a circuit or something

04:09:46.700 --> 04:09:50.300
yes yeah there's like their circuitry and you've got your n orgs or gates you like there's stuff

04:09:50.300 --> 04:09:54.140
like that it's very much like that like what are the enemies in the game like what um they're like

04:09:55.180 --> 04:09:58.780
try to bite you and you can get guns and shoot and kill them but I saw there's like shooting

04:09:58.780 --> 04:10:02.380
going on yeah but that's like a minor just like another problem to solve in the game basically

04:10:02.380 --> 04:10:07.420
okay all right see see what we do there we just started talking about the game as we're trying

04:10:07.420 --> 04:10:13.340
oh my god that's like a game okay that's horrible anyway is there is that basically the struggle

04:10:13.340 --> 04:10:19.900
that's that struggle how to get human like intimate human time I feel like it was like

04:10:19.900 --> 04:10:25.980
that a little bit more in the past I feel like it's been better lately but I think it's because

04:10:25.980 --> 04:10:31.340
um when we started dating I wasn't streaming and I kind of just like gave up like my trip in New

04:10:31.340 --> 04:10:38.940
Zealand I give up like like I left Sweden so I was just like in LA which I hate I hate LA I don't

04:10:38.940 --> 04:10:45.100
like LA at all uh it's hard to make friends that are like real that are into the same stuff as you

04:10:45.100 --> 04:10:49.660
it's it was just really hard for me to connect with anyone especially also like being a European

04:10:49.660 --> 04:10:55.260
and like being around Americans was very strange so the only thing I had when I came here was him

04:10:56.060 --> 04:11:01.980
and I um and I didn't expect because because yeah because we had we had like two weeks of

04:11:01.980 --> 04:11:05.340
hanging out and like he would be on his computer sometimes and like do emails and stuff but I

04:11:05.340 --> 04:11:09.180
wasn't thinking that he would stream like 12 hours a day and it was pretty like it was pretty

04:11:09.180 --> 04:11:13.580
intense like in the beginning of it as well and I realized it was really hard to like get attention

04:11:13.580 --> 04:11:19.420
and get time because his like love meter would be like full if I was just in the house and that's

04:11:19.420 --> 04:11:23.100
just kind of like the way he is and for me back then when I didn't have anything else to do

04:11:23.740 --> 04:11:30.380
um was kind of like a it was kind of crazy uh for me I feel like right now because I do work as well

04:11:30.380 --> 04:11:36.060
and I have things going from for me and I have other friends uh now that I made I feel like

04:11:36.060 --> 04:11:40.700
it's a lot easier because and and I can definitely like enjoy just like being in separate rooms and

04:11:40.700 --> 04:11:44.620
just like hear him in the background is really nice I can like I can sit and paint and like in

04:11:44.620 --> 04:11:47.900
my room and I will do that for hours while I'm just like hearing a scream in the background it's

04:11:47.900 --> 04:11:52.700
kind of like comforting that he's he's just there it feels nice I like it because to you that's the

04:11:52.700 --> 04:11:56.460
sound of happiness yes because I know he's right there yeah it's nice and they will come in and

04:11:56.460 --> 04:11:59.820
check on me sometimes and it's it's kind of like it's actually very comforting it's very nice

04:11:59.820 --> 04:12:04.860
I like it yeah I think that's kind of what a relationship is like you do fun things together

04:12:04.860 --> 04:12:09.100
you know you share moments together but also just like having someone like around you is really

04:12:09.100 --> 04:12:15.820
really nice and I think that's probably maybe it's me growing up maybe that's what it is and

04:12:15.820 --> 04:12:20.140
like I start liking like the kind of I feel like we're like an old couple like we're like 80 we're

04:12:20.140 --> 04:12:24.700
just like around we don't really have to talk much it's it's nice to just do that that fills

04:12:24.700 --> 04:12:31.660
your love meter that um I like this terminology love I need both I mean okay you're making it

04:12:31.660 --> 04:12:35.420
sound like that I'm like craving like I haven't said anything I'm not saying anything I haven't

04:12:35.420 --> 04:12:40.140
said a single thing at all I know exactly what you're thinking so much judging going on there's no

04:12:40.140 --> 04:12:45.580
judging no but like we I think I think whenever we do plan something out like if we if we go on

04:12:45.580 --> 04:12:51.500
a trip like every other month or once a month I feel like usually like that's enough as long as

04:12:51.500 --> 04:12:56.220
he's not playing factorial the entire time like if he if I feel like he's going on these trips

04:12:56.220 --> 04:13:00.700
with me and he's not like doing things with me or he's not he's not interested in like spending

04:13:00.700 --> 04:13:04.700
time or like being present with me then I'll feel like I just feel like I'm just wasting time right

04:13:04.700 --> 04:13:09.020
now and then I get kind of disappointed but otherwise I think this like this is fun I think

04:13:09.020 --> 04:13:12.700
this is like spending time together because we're like doing something together yeah this is nice

04:13:12.700 --> 04:13:19.100
it's fun yeah my my love meter is your lever it is full it's my social life otherwise we like to

04:13:19.580 --> 04:13:23.180
think about it that way that like I need like a little bit more of like this one thing like

04:13:23.180 --> 04:13:28.620
quality time and he needs like almost zero quality time but like let's say that I we took away like

04:13:28.620 --> 04:13:33.260
physical touch you would probably not be very happy so you need physical touch so it's not just

04:13:33.260 --> 04:13:37.500
back to me huh no I'm a very cuddly person yeah like cuddly and then you're like I guess like

04:13:37.500 --> 04:13:41.980
acts of service like if I do something for you you get really happy like hot chocolate yeah like if

04:13:41.980 --> 04:13:46.220
I give him hot chocolate in the morning he gets really happy so the actual it's not the hot

04:13:46.220 --> 04:13:50.060
chocolate it's the giving of the hot chocolate no it's just the hot chocolate but if she gives

04:13:50.060 --> 04:13:55.420
it to me I didn't have to get it myself that's really nice all right well if you have to choose

04:13:55.420 --> 04:14:01.100
between factorial and the drama or political discourse which probably political discourse

04:14:01.100 --> 04:14:07.260
probably my calling but I am a good factorial player like what role exactly does factorial

04:14:07.260 --> 04:14:12.380
play in your streaming life oh well right now it's just usually there are like these games that I

04:14:12.380 --> 04:14:14.860
play in the background as I have conversations because it's hard for me to just sit on the

04:14:14.860 --> 04:14:18.380
computer and just talk and not like be playing a game at the same time so it's just something

04:14:18.380 --> 04:14:21.500
to keep me kind of like occupied you know I was able to buy like those little like widget things

04:14:21.500 --> 04:14:27.660
I guess yeah that's what yeah basically yeah it's like minecraft or factorial for me all right well

04:14:27.660 --> 04:14:34.300
