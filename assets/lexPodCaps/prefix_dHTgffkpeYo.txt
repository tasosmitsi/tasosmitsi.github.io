WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
we would come up to these rafts and these boats

00:05.120 --> 00:09.440
that were in really dire shape and people would be pushed off

00:09.440 --> 00:11.760
and people would jump off and people would fall

00:11.760 --> 00:16.760
into the water and some of them couldn't swim.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.200
And so we found ourselves in this moment

00:21.200 --> 00:23.040
where we had a choice.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.240
We could film someone drown in front of us

00:26.240 --> 00:27.960
or we could put our cameras down

00:27.960 --> 00:29.560
and pull them out of the water.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.280
The following is a conversation with Sky Fitzgerald,

00:34.280 --> 00:37.240
a two-time Oscar nominated documentary filmmaker

00:37.240 --> 00:41.120
who made the films Hunger Ward about the war in Yemen,

00:41.120 --> 00:44.080
Lifeboat about the search and rescue operations

00:44.080 --> 00:48.400
off the coast of Libya and 50 Feet from Syria

00:48.400 --> 00:50.300
about the war in Syria.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.160

00:55.280 --> 00:56.480

00:56.480 --> 00:59.960
And now dear friends, here's Sky Fitzgerald.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.520
Nearly 811 million people worldwide are hungry today

01:05.520 --> 01:08.440
and 45 million people are on the edge of famine

01:08.440 --> 01:10.180
across 43 countries.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.360
How do you feel?

01:12.360 --> 01:14.680
How do you make sense of that many people suffering

01:14.680 --> 01:17.300
from hunger and famine in the world today?

01:17.300 --> 01:20.080
I don't know if I can make sense of it, Lex.

01:20.080 --> 01:25.080
I mean, I think it's deeply disturbing to me

01:25.960 --> 01:27.760
that as a global community,

01:27.760 --> 01:32.200
we've allowed this number of people to go hungry

01:32.200 --> 01:34.800
when the food to feed them exists

01:34.800 --> 01:37.800
and the resources to feed them exists.

01:37.800 --> 01:42.040
I think the thing that disturbs me most about those figures

01:42.040 --> 01:47.000
is that many of those who are starving today

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
or going hungry today are the net result of war

01:52.600 --> 01:55.480
and intentional acts by leaders

01:55.480 --> 01:57.280
to starve entire populations.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.180
And that's the most deeply disturbing part to me.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.760
You know your history and we all know

02:04.760 --> 02:08.840
that deeply embedded in the Geneva Conventions

02:08.840 --> 02:12.300
post-World War II, the intent of one of those articles

02:12.300 --> 02:17.080
was to ban the use of starvation as a weapon of war

02:17.080 --> 02:20.780
because of what Hitler did during World War II.

02:20.780 --> 02:24.100
That's been reiterated multiple times over the years

02:24.100 --> 02:27.780
in international humanitarian law, including in 2018,

02:27.780 --> 02:30.540
because of the Saudi blockade over Yemen.

02:30.540 --> 02:34.380
And yet to this day, starvation as a weapon of war

02:34.380 --> 02:36.900
continues to be used in Ethiopia,

02:36.900 --> 02:39.780
obviously in Ukraine right now and in Yemen

02:39.780 --> 02:41.140
with the blockade over the country.

02:41.140 --> 02:44.580
And that disgusts me that the law is in place

02:44.580 --> 02:46.900
but it won't be enforced by the international bodies

02:46.900 --> 02:48.580
and the nation states that make up

02:48.580 --> 02:50.300
the international community.

02:50.300 --> 02:55.300
So the starvation is a result of actions, human decisions

02:56.540 --> 03:00.560
that it's especially painful to make sense of.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.540
For me personally, yeah.

03:02.540 --> 03:05.060
I think that if you and I sit in here,

03:05.060 --> 03:10.060
didn't eat for three days and had to lay our head

03:10.060 --> 03:12.640
on the sidewalk for a couple nights,

03:12.640 --> 03:17.640
I think we would take hunger and homelessness

03:17.740 --> 03:19.260
a lot more seriously.

03:19.260 --> 03:22.340
And I think that's, for some reason,

03:22.340 --> 03:25.660
that's missing at this moment in history, tragically.

03:25.660 --> 03:29.260
And I think until that we can generate enough empathy

03:30.260 --> 03:32.460
that's immediate for all of us to understand

03:32.460 --> 03:34.200
what that means to go hungry.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.580
I'm not sure we're gonna sort of marshal

03:36.580 --> 03:39.580
the global community to solve it.

03:39.580 --> 03:44.580
I did just that by the way, fasted for three days recently.

03:44.740 --> 03:47.480
It was fundamentally different, I think,

03:47.480 --> 03:51.960
because the thing that would be terrifying to me

03:51.960 --> 03:54.140
is not the fasting, but the hopelessness

03:54.140 --> 03:57.080
at the end of the fast, like I wouldn't know

03:57.080 --> 03:58.840
when the next meal is coming.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.460
I always had the freedom to have the meal.

04:01.460 --> 04:06.460
The fear, not just your own ability to eat and survive,

04:07.080 --> 04:09.000
but your family's, if there's loved ones,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.640
that's the other thing I don't have, I'm single.

04:11.640 --> 04:16.460
So I feel like the worst suffering is watching

04:16.460 --> 04:18.220
somebody you love that you're supposed

04:18.220 --> 04:21.800
to be a caretaker of, and you can't take care of them.

04:23.940 --> 04:27.220
And if all of that is caused by leaders

04:30.700 --> 04:35.620
as a weapon of war, that is especially painful.

04:35.620 --> 04:39.840
So how can we help?

04:41.460 --> 04:42.880
What are the ways to help?

04:43.720 --> 04:46.440
How do we alleviate this suffering?

04:48.360 --> 04:52.780
Well, I think on the humanitarian front,

04:52.780 --> 04:56.520
we have to be aggressive and attentive

04:56.520 --> 04:59.220
and intervene in significant ways.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.720
And I think on the political front,

05:01.720 --> 05:06.600
we have to hold players accountable for their actions.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.340
So the leaders that start the war,

05:08.340 --> 05:12.280
so when you say we have to speak up about the decisions

05:12.280 --> 05:14.160
and the humans making those decisions

05:14.160 --> 05:15.520
that lead to the starvation.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.160
For example, let's make it concrete.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.200
So when I was, I don't wanna jump ahead,

05:20.200 --> 05:22.520
but when I was filming Hunger Ward in Yemen,

05:25.020 --> 05:30.020
I met a mother who, when she gave birth, weighed 70 pounds.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.440
The mother weighed 70 pounds.

05:34.440 --> 05:39.440
And so her daughter was starved in the womb.

05:42.440 --> 05:46.600
When she was born, she was born into a world

05:46.600 --> 05:50.160
with no breast milk, very little formula.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.360
So she was starved before birth.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.680
She was born into a world where she continued to be starved

05:56.680 --> 06:00.040
by a mother who herself was starved.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.300
I watched that child, her name is Asila, die in front of me.

06:05.840 --> 06:10.720
Asila had no chance for all those things we hope for,

06:10.760 --> 06:12.600
for a child in this world.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.440
She didn't have a chance to grow up.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.760
She didn't have a chance to discover love.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.080
She didn't have a chance to have a career.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.240
She was robbed of all of those things

06:22.240 --> 06:24.480
because of the insidious nature of hunger

06:24.480 --> 06:26.380
that she was born into.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.860
She didn't have to die.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.720
She was not starving.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.880
Her mother was being starved

06:34.880 --> 06:37.100
because of the blockade over the country.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.880
Now who instituted that blockade?

06:39.800 --> 06:43.920
MBS in Saudi Arabia with the reinforcement

06:43.920 --> 06:46.440
and sort of tacit approval of the United States,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.600
our own government here.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.440
And so there are people who are responsible

06:51.440 --> 06:52.880
for the starvation of children

06:52.880 --> 06:55.600
and I think we need to hold them accountable.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.600
Now that's incredibly difficult to do,

06:58.600 --> 07:00.260
but just because it's difficult

07:00.260 --> 07:02.520
doesn't mean it ought not to be done.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.920
And we'll talk about many cases like these

07:06.920 --> 07:09.040
throughout history and going on today.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.520
Let's talk about Hunger Ward.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.360
Let's dive in.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.920
You've been nominated for an Oscar twice.

07:14.920 --> 07:19.480
This is one of the times for a documentary.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.240
Can you please tell me what Hunger Ward,

07:24.240 --> 07:27.440
The Last Hope Between War and Starvation is about?

07:27.440 --> 07:29.640
Hunger Ward is a short documentary

07:31.120 --> 07:34.720
that really is an attempt to illustrate

07:34.720 --> 07:38.320
the effects of the conflict on Yemen,

07:38.320 --> 07:40.260
specifically on civilians.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.800
And we document it in both the north

07:43.800 --> 07:44.820
and the south of the country

07:44.820 --> 07:46.760
because it's a bifurcated country.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.320
The south is held by the globally recognized government

07:50.320 --> 07:52.460
in the south, which up until last week,

07:53.680 --> 07:56.320
was run by, at least on the surface,

07:56.320 --> 08:00.160
by President Hadi holed up in Riyadh.

08:00.160 --> 08:05.160
He was essentially removed from office last week

08:05.240 --> 08:10.240
by, most people would agree, the Emiratis and the Saudis

08:10.520 --> 08:12.760
to put in place a presidential council.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.520
So we wanted to show that starvation was happening

08:16.520 --> 08:19.800
in very similar fashions, both in the south and the north.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.540
So, and we wanted to do this film

08:22.540 --> 08:27.360
because so few people in the west know anything

08:27.360 --> 08:29.120
about the conflict in Yemen,

08:29.120 --> 08:32.760
nor the U.S.'s complicity in it.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.280
And so my intent with the project was try to bring it

08:35.280 --> 08:38.360
to a larger western audience as an attempt to intervene

08:38.360 --> 08:40.240
and change the political status quo,

08:40.240 --> 08:44.680
which allows the use of starvation in Yemen to continue.

08:44.680 --> 08:49.280
So U.S. complicity, who are the bad guys?

08:49.280 --> 08:53.600
Now, the world, unfortunately, cannot be painted

08:53.600 --> 08:56.760
in black and white of good guys and bad guys.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.720
But for the purpose of conversation,

08:59.720 --> 09:04.720
who is causing suffering in the world in this situation?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.280
Who started the war, why?

09:09.600 --> 09:14.200
And then, of course, the roots of war go back in history.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.680
But let's start at the top.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.760
Well, there are bad actors and there are less bad actors.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.960
I mean, I think that's always the case in war, probably.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.640
And everybody loses in war.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.200
Yeah, I concur with that statement.

09:28.120 --> 09:33.120
In the case of sort of the status quo in Yemen right now,

09:33.200 --> 09:36.080
it's a completely asymmetrical war.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.200
And so the Saudi coalition,

09:38.200 --> 09:41.400
which is made up of primarily Saudi Arabia,

09:41.400 --> 09:46.400
the Emiratis, United States, France, Britain

09:46.440 --> 09:49.440
supplying weapons, but it's really driven

09:49.440 --> 09:51.480
and catalyzed by Saudi Arabia.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.000
And it's asymmetrical to a great extent

09:55.000 --> 09:58.800
just because of the incredible firepower by air

09:58.800 --> 10:03.800
that the Saudis use continuously to pummel Northern Yemen.

10:04.840 --> 10:09.080
When I was there, the sheer volume of airstrikes

10:09.080 --> 10:10.760
is hard to describe.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.920
And we show the result of only one in the film, really.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.320
But it's an asymmetrical war.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.240
The de facto authorities of the North, Ansar Allah,

10:19.240 --> 10:21.360
also known as the Houthi rebel group,

10:22.320 --> 10:25.200
they don't have an air force, right?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.720
They have a drone force, but they don't have an air force.

10:27.720 --> 10:29.920
And so from a military standpoint,

10:29.920 --> 10:31.880
it's completely asymmetrical.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.640
The Saudis really don't commit troops to the ground.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.200
They use only proxies to fight on the ground.

10:37.200 --> 10:42.200
What is the narrative they use to justify war?

10:42.480 --> 10:46.360
So there's a story on every side in war.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.080
Some of it is grounded in truth.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.080
Some of it is not at all grounded in truth,

10:52.080 --> 10:54.120
also known as propaganda.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.640
What's the narrative used by the Saudis for this war?

10:58.480 --> 11:00.960
The Saudi line is essentially that

11:00.960 --> 11:03.160
the Houthis are an illegitimate government

11:04.480 --> 11:08.760
and that it's really a proxy war between Iran,

11:08.760 --> 11:10.680
who supports the Houthis nominally,

11:11.800 --> 11:13.280
and the rest of the world.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.960
That's the Saudi narrative.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.320
The reality is something altogether different.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.600
While the Houthis do receive support from Iran,

11:20.600 --> 11:25.600
this is a war started by and sustained by MBS in Saudi Arabia.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.760
Who is MBS?

11:26.760 --> 11:28.360
Mohammed bin Salman.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.280
And who is he?

11:29.280 --> 11:33.160
He is the son of the ruler of Saudi Arabia.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.680
What's his power?

11:34.680 --> 11:36.680
I'm asking basic dumb questions.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.240
He's the de facto ruler.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.000
Of the military and the-

11:40.000 --> 11:43.880
Yes, he seized control of the country several years ago,

11:43.880 --> 11:45.760
even though he, on the surface,

11:45.760 --> 11:47.360
is not the ruler of Saudi Arabia.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.200
He is.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.040
He's the crown prince.

11:49.040 --> 11:50.080
I'm sorry to interrupt often,

11:50.080 --> 11:53.760
but who is he as a man?

11:53.760 --> 11:54.680
What's your sense of-

11:54.680 --> 11:56.640
Yeah, so I've never met him

11:56.640 --> 11:59.600
and I likely will never meet him, hopefully.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.560
But he is, I know a lot about him through his actions,

12:04.560 --> 12:06.600
sort of in the MENA region,

12:06.600 --> 12:08.920
Middle East and North Africa region.

12:08.920 --> 12:13.040
And he is one of three, in my view,

12:13.040 --> 12:15.400
as an American sitting here in the U.S.

12:16.040 --> 12:19.360
Three people in the world that I think

12:19.360 --> 12:24.360
has caused such an incredible volume of misery

12:24.440 --> 12:28.160
and suffering and murder on this planet

12:28.160 --> 12:33.160
that I think if he weren't around,

12:34.800 --> 12:36.360
the world would be a lot better place.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.480
And I'm not a violent person by nature,

12:38.480 --> 12:40.040
but there are three human beings

12:40.040 --> 12:43.640
that I think the world would be better off without.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.880
Do you have a mind, before I ask other questions,

12:45.880 --> 12:47.320
mentioning the three?

12:47.320 --> 12:50.400
Oh yeah, Assad is one in Syria,

12:50.400 --> 12:52.280
and that comes out of an earlier project

12:52.280 --> 12:54.520
that I did in Syria and Turkey,

12:54.520 --> 12:59.520
and what I saw Assad as a ruler do to his own people.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.040
And Putin would be the third.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.320
Those three human beings are murderers

13:07.320 --> 13:11.600
on a scale beyond imagining.

13:11.640 --> 13:16.160
On MBS, are you able to think as a documentary filmmaker,

13:16.160 --> 13:19.080
as a human being, as a scholar, as a thinker,

13:19.080 --> 13:22.120
with an open mind about a man like that

13:22.120 --> 13:23.840
who does evil onto the world,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.040
and what that must feel like

13:26.040 --> 13:28.080
to be inside the mind of that man?

13:28.080 --> 13:31.760
So basically, consider his world view.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.320
With most evil people, with all people probably,

13:35.320 --> 13:38.040
but with people who do evil onto the world,

13:38.040 --> 13:40.240
they think they're doing good.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.600
They're the hero of their own story.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.200
Right, and so to be able to place yourself,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.920
I feel like, for me, to understand a person,

13:47.920 --> 13:51.240
I have to literally, like the way actors

13:51.240 --> 13:54.280
kind of have to do, you know,

13:54.280 --> 13:57.280
live inside the body of the person they're trying to study.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.200
Inhabit the character.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.680
Inhabit the person.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.120
So are you able to do that,

14:01.120 --> 14:06.120
or because you are also studying the people who suffer

14:06.680 --> 14:10.120
as a result, as a consequence of their actions,

14:11.080 --> 14:13.520
you put them in a box, and you say,

14:13.520 --> 14:17.840
I hate the person in that box, I'm going to move on.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.680
This goes back to your black and white statement

14:19.680 --> 14:20.680
at the beginning, right?

14:20.680 --> 14:24.280
It's like, the world as a whole, of course,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.920
is every gradation of gray, right?

14:26.920 --> 14:29.040
My background is theater, like,

14:29.040 --> 14:32.400
and so I was trained long before I picked up a camera

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
to inhabit other characters, right?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.120
I have two degrees in theater,

14:36.120 --> 14:38.520
and so that level of sort of like

14:38.560 --> 14:40.200
walking into other people's shoes

14:40.200 --> 14:44.200
and trying to understand and empathize with their worldview

14:44.200 --> 14:48.000
is fundamental to how I live my life and how I do my work.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.200
So in the case of those three that I named,

14:50.200 --> 14:51.920
Assad, MBS, and Putin,

14:51.920 --> 14:54.200
yeah, I can go there and think through

14:54.200 --> 14:57.800
how they came to be who they are, right?

14:57.800 --> 14:59.360
From afar, right?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.720
And after I go through that process,

15:02.720 --> 15:04.920
I still don't think there's any way

15:04.920 --> 15:08.520
that one can justify what they've done.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.440
We're going to talk about each of those people, sure.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.920
Well, I'm not an expert on any of them.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.880
You're a human being, which makes you

15:20.200 --> 15:23.280
a partial expert on human nature,

15:23.280 --> 15:24.400
because nobody's an expert.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.320
You're just as good as anyone else.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.640
Anybody who actually cares a camera

15:28.640 --> 15:31.600
and listens and observe others

15:31.600 --> 15:34.120
isn't especially an expert of human nature.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.560
Who's willing to take that leap

15:37.560 --> 15:41.320
and truly understand somebody of any level, not leaders.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.680
I feel like to understand a leader,

15:42.680 --> 15:45.040
you have to first understand humans.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.200
And to understand humans,

15:46.200 --> 15:49.560
you have to see humans that they're worse than their best,

15:49.560 --> 15:52.280
which is something that you've definitely done.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.440
So let's stick on hunger ward.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.880
This lens that you've chosen to look at this

15:56.880 --> 16:00.560
is through a single, maybe you can speak to that.

16:00.560 --> 16:05.560
You've mentioned the starvation as a result of war.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.680
What is the documentary?

16:08.680 --> 16:13.480
What is the lens you've chosen to give the world a peek

16:13.480 --> 16:16.960
at the results, at the suffering that's a result of this war?

16:18.080 --> 16:19.720
People a lot of times will ask me

16:19.720 --> 16:21.360
after they've seen hunger ward.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.720
They ask where the hope is, right?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.880
You read the byline earlier.

16:29.880 --> 16:30.720
The last hope.

16:32.280 --> 16:37.280
And what I try to focus on in many of my films,

16:37.400 --> 16:42.400
including hunger ward is in the very difficult context

16:42.680 --> 16:47.680
of war as the case is in hunger ward in Yemen.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.320
I look for hope and I look for inspiration.

16:50.320 --> 16:54.240
And I do that through people who are doing incredible things

16:54.240 --> 16:56.680
under the most difficult circumstances.

16:56.720 --> 17:01.720
So when I set out to do a film about starvation in Yemen,

17:03.520 --> 17:06.200
right, I mean, just listen to that statement.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.000
Where's the hope there, right?

17:08.000 --> 17:12.520
And yet what I found, what I discovered were human beings

17:12.520 --> 17:14.280
that we could tell the story through

17:14.280 --> 17:18.000
who are incredible, inspirational human beings

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
doing amazing things every day.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.840
One of those is Makiya Maji,

17:23.840 --> 17:25.840
a nurse practitioner in the North of the country

17:25.840 --> 17:27.440
at a small rural clinic.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.240
And another is Dr. Aida Al-Sadiq,

17:30.240 --> 17:33.080
who is a pediatrician in the South of the country.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.040
And so we chose to tell the story sort of

17:35.040 --> 17:38.400
through their experiences as caregivers,

17:38.400 --> 17:43.400
devoting their lives to try to save this entire cohort,

17:43.400 --> 17:45.760
this entire generation of children

17:45.760 --> 17:48.800
that has been born into starvation.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.080
And that's an incredible, difficult task,

17:52.080 --> 17:56.480
but equally inspirational to watch these human beings

17:56.480 --> 18:00.400
devote every minute of every day to save a child.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.200
I mean, in my view,

18:02.200 --> 18:04.400
nothing is more important than that action.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.120
Maybe on that point real quick,

18:07.560 --> 18:11.400
so there is suffering at scale, starvation at scale.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.520
There's, I mean, the numbers,

18:15.680 --> 18:17.080
maybe you can mention in Yemen,

18:17.080 --> 18:19.400
what are the numbers in terms of people and starvation,

18:19.400 --> 18:24.200
but from a perspective of a nurse practitioner or a doctor,

18:24.200 --> 18:27.200
you always have, you're treating one person in front of you.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.360
So how do you make sense of that calculus

18:31.360 --> 18:35.120
of like there's a huge number of people suffering,

18:35.120 --> 18:37.560
and then there's just the person in front of you?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.160
Is that all we can do as humans

18:43.160 --> 18:45.440
is just to help one person at a time?

18:45.440 --> 18:48.000
Is that the right way to think

18:48.000 --> 18:49.480
and to approach these problems?

18:49.480 --> 18:52.760
Or can you actually make sense of the numbers?

18:52.760 --> 18:55.000
Speaking just as a human being,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.520
I think the scale of suffering is so great in Yemen

18:59.760 --> 19:04.760
that I think I'd be overwhelmed if I focused on that scale.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.480
You've probably heard that a child dies

19:11.480 --> 19:15.120
every 75 seconds in Yemen from hunger.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.360
So we've been sitting here, how long?

19:17.400 --> 19:18.800
35 minutes or so.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.320
That's a good handful of children

19:21.320 --> 19:23.480
that have already passed away.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.520
So to overcome sort of, I think,

19:25.520 --> 19:28.960
that danger of psychic numbing, which can happen

19:28.960 --> 19:32.480
when you think about suffering on such a large scale,

19:32.480 --> 19:35.200
as a filmmaker, as a human being,

19:35.200 --> 19:37.040
I have to focus in on the individuals,

19:37.040 --> 19:39.200
on those human beings in front of me.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.200
And I think that's exactly what Dr. Al-Sadiq and Makiya do

19:42.200 --> 19:43.880
to keep going each day.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.240
And one of the amazing things

19:45.240 --> 19:48.200
about these two healthcare providers

19:48.200 --> 19:50.520
that we showcased in the film is that

19:50.520 --> 19:54.160
they treat anyone who shows up, right?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.200
They don't have to have money.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.640
They don't have to have any resources.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.560
They just have to get to the clinic or the hospital.

20:00.560 --> 20:05.560
And it's incredibly moving to see sort of the flexibility

20:06.000 --> 20:09.240
of their thinking in terms of how they make that work.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.680
Makiya, for example, I saw her in the north of the country.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.800
It's an incredibly rural clinic that she works at.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.520
So it's like a magnet for all the cases

20:17.520 --> 20:18.920
in the north of the country.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.960
People come from hundreds of kilometers away sometimes

20:21.960 --> 20:25.880
for specialty treatment of pediatric malnutrition.

20:25.880 --> 20:29.120
And I, one time I saw a child come in

20:29.120 --> 20:33.400
and it was a male relative that brought this young girl in.

20:33.400 --> 20:38.400
And just because of sort of the gender dynamics in Yemen,

20:39.000 --> 20:42.440
there had to be a parent or a relative there

20:42.440 --> 20:44.320
to stay with the child while they're at the clinic.

20:44.320 --> 20:45.920
And it was a male relative.

20:45.920 --> 20:49.880
And so, you know, what many doctors in that instance

20:49.880 --> 20:51.760
would do would just turn them away.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.240
And instead what Makiya did is she walked into one

20:54.240 --> 20:56.680
of the rooms, talked to one of the other mothers

20:56.680 --> 20:59.400
and convinced them to become the temporary guardian

20:59.400 --> 21:03.480
essentially of this child until a female relative

21:03.480 --> 21:04.640
could arrive.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.160
So, you know, she's flexible.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.360
She finds solutions rather than allowing the problems

21:09.360 --> 21:11.000
to deter solutions.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.200
One child at a time.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.960
Yeah, yeah, one child at a time.

21:16.400 --> 21:21.400
You mentioned that you saw a child die in front of you.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.240
So when you're filming this as a filmmaker,

21:27.040 --> 21:32.040
what's that like psychologically, philosophically,

21:33.560 --> 21:36.640
creatively as a filmmaker, as a storyteller?

21:39.680 --> 21:40.880
What do you do there?

21:40.880 --> 21:43.920
As a human and as a filmmaker?

21:43.920 --> 21:45.840
Well, what's that whole experience like?

21:45.840 --> 21:47.440
Because you get to, like you said,

21:47.440 --> 21:49.720
you take it through the whole journey

21:49.720 --> 21:52.640
of a starving mother giving birth to a starving child.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.320
It's not something I want to film.

21:57.480 --> 22:01.760
It's not something that I certainly wanted to happen

22:01.760 --> 22:05.080
or seek out, but it happened.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.760
And the sad truth is that it happens every week

22:07.760 --> 22:09.280
at that hospital.

22:09.280 --> 22:13.040
And so when it happened in this instance,

22:13.040 --> 22:17.440
I felt an incredible responsibility to do justice

22:17.440 --> 22:18.960
to that reality.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.280
To acknowledge that a child had just died

22:22.280 --> 22:24.880
of starvation related causes.

22:27.080 --> 22:31.880
And to find some way, if the parents wanted us to,

22:31.880 --> 22:35.400
to integrate that into this story we'd bring back

22:35.400 --> 22:39.440
to a Western audience.

22:39.440 --> 22:44.440
And I've filmed many difficult things over the years.

22:49.520 --> 22:54.320
And usually I really love filming.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.440
And I didn't love filming Hunger Ward.

22:56.440 --> 23:00.440
It was not a process that I enjoyed

23:00.440 --> 23:03.000
on any way she would perform, sadly,

23:03.000 --> 23:04.280
because of the content.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.920
Because who wants to watch a child die in front of them?

23:06.920 --> 23:10.160
I don't, but I did and I had to.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.040
And when that happened, I felt an incredible responsibility

23:14.040 --> 23:17.280
again to go deep, right?

23:17.280 --> 23:20.920
To go deep with that family, to tell the story

23:20.920 --> 23:25.920
of this hospital with every sort of ounce of focus

23:26.400 --> 23:28.800
and talent that I could bring to the story

23:28.800 --> 23:33.800
because people should know that children are dying

23:33.800 --> 23:36.080
of starvation right now as we sit here.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.920
And that that doesn't have to happen.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.280
And it is happening because of political dynamics

23:40.280 --> 23:41.480
that we can intervene on.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.680
Is there times you wanted to walk away,

23:46.760 --> 23:48.600
quit the telling of the story,

23:51.200 --> 23:53.600
come back to the United States

23:54.680 --> 23:59.080
where you can just appreciate

23:59.560 --> 24:04.560
the wonderful comfort you can have just sitting there

24:05.280 --> 24:10.280
and having food and freedom to do whatever you want,

24:12.560 --> 24:13.880
those kinds of things.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.680
Doesn't have to be in the United States,

24:15.680 --> 24:17.600
in a lot of places in the world.

24:17.600 --> 24:21.360
Well, that dynamic of sort of like survivors guilt

24:21.360 --> 24:23.880
on some level definitely exists.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.840
One of the hardest things from Hunger Ward

24:25.840 --> 24:28.960
actually was eating, right?

24:28.960 --> 24:31.280
Because we were in these malnutrition clinics,

24:31.280 --> 24:34.440
they're called TFCs, Therapeutic Feeding Centers,

24:34.440 --> 24:39.440
where over a long period of time,

24:41.280 --> 24:45.400
children lost the ability to eat normal food, right?

24:45.400 --> 24:49.600
And couldn't digest it and just were literally starving

24:49.600 --> 24:53.280
and the practitioners were trying to bring them back

24:53.280 --> 24:58.160
to a state of thriving, but to leave those clinics, right?

24:58.160 --> 25:00.880
And to go to our camp or to go to our hotel

25:00.880 --> 25:03.440
and then to have access to food, right?

25:03.440 --> 25:06.640
Because we could buy food on the streets and in the hotels.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.880
I mean, it was a very intentional act

25:10.880 --> 25:12.280
throughout the course of the shoot

25:12.280 --> 25:14.720
to look at a piece of bread, right?

25:14.720 --> 25:16.640
Or to look at a bowl of rice

25:16.640 --> 25:20.320
and think about that child in the TFC

25:20.360 --> 25:22.960
and think about how the privilege

25:22.960 --> 25:26.560
of having that bowl of rice that I could eat and digest.

25:26.560 --> 25:31.560
So it certainly every day helped me appreciate, right?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.280
The privilege I had.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.520
Every bite you take.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.680
With every bite, absolutely.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.720
And so I wouldn't call it guilt.

25:39.720 --> 25:40.880
It wasn't exactly guilt,

25:40.880 --> 25:44.120
but it was definitely mindfulness, right?

25:44.120 --> 25:48.320
Meditate on the suffering of people who can't.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.720
That's right, exactly.

25:49.720 --> 25:53.320
So that knowledge, it was catalytic in some ways.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.120
It sort of moved us forward,

25:55.120 --> 25:59.240
really wanting to shape the most powerful story we could

25:59.240 --> 26:02.320
because we were surrounded by so much suffering every day.

26:03.160 --> 26:06.560
How did filming that movie change you as a man?

26:07.880 --> 26:08.880
As a human being?

26:09.760 --> 26:12.320
You've filmed a few difficult documentaries.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.720
That one is a heavy one.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.560
When you think of the person you were before you filmed it,

26:20.560 --> 26:21.560
and now when you wake up every morning

26:21.560 --> 26:23.200
and look yourself in the mirror,

26:23.200 --> 26:25.320
how is that person different?

26:25.320 --> 26:29.440
Every documentary I do changes me in a different way.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.760
Like I am not static in that sense, right?

26:32.760 --> 26:34.160
I'm preformed.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.120
It's like I change with every project

26:36.120 --> 26:40.480
because so many of them are difficult and challenging, right?

26:40.480 --> 26:43.080
And so in order to do them,

26:43.080 --> 26:46.320
I have to allow myself to change and be changed by them.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.920
In the case of Hunger Ward,

26:47.920 --> 26:51.880
you may remember the girl Omeyma,

26:51.880 --> 26:56.640
who's the 10-year-old girl who we showcase in Auden

26:56.640 --> 26:58.560
in the south of the country.

26:58.560 --> 27:03.560
And we were there when she was admitted to the hospital.

27:04.640 --> 27:08.240
And when she was admitted,

27:08.240 --> 27:10.760
this 10-year-old girl weighed 24 pounds

27:10.760 --> 27:13.920
and she could barely stand up.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.880
And we started with the permission of the family

27:18.840 --> 27:21.480
to start to document her treatment

27:21.480 --> 27:24.880
and to see what would happen with this young girl

27:24.880 --> 27:27.640
who is so severely malnourished.

27:27.640 --> 27:31.560
And we watched her be treated by the nurses

27:31.560 --> 27:35.120
and the doctors in Sadaka Hospital.

27:35.120 --> 27:38.840
And slowly over the course of a couple of weeks,

27:38.840 --> 27:40.800
we saw her change.

27:40.800 --> 27:44.160
We saw her start to sort of gain strength

27:44.160 --> 27:45.880
and start to recover.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.880
And she also watched the caregivers very carefully.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.320
And I watched her watch them.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.320
And I'll never forget,

27:58.320 --> 28:00.000
there was a moment where

28:02.040 --> 28:05.040
about two and a half weeks, I think, into her treatment,

28:05.040 --> 28:06.760
we walked into a room

28:06.760 --> 28:11.000
and I saw her offering a capful of water

28:11.000 --> 28:15.720
to another younger child who was also starving, right?

28:16.280 --> 28:18.240
The shot's actually in the film.

28:18.240 --> 28:22.280
And so to see Omeyma, this child who's starving,

28:23.320 --> 28:27.120
giving sustenance to a younger, more vulnerable child

28:27.120 --> 28:31.960
who was also starving, moved me deeply, right?

28:31.960 --> 28:36.960
So I saw her learn from the caregivers around her, right?

28:38.440 --> 28:40.840
And as a human being, as a filmmaker,

28:40.840 --> 28:44.200
I was incredibly inspired by Omeyma.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.480
That capacity for compassion is there.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.440
Even within a 10-year-old girl who's starving, right?

28:49.440 --> 28:52.360
And so you asked what changed me.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.360
That's one moment, right?

28:54.360 --> 28:57.080
Rather than being crushed by such heavy content,

28:57.080 --> 28:58.640
it was actually the opposite,

28:58.640 --> 29:02.320
where I came away inspired by a 10-year-old girl.

29:02.320 --> 29:05.200
And I didn't anticipate that,

29:05.200 --> 29:07.360
I didn't think that's what this content would do,

29:07.360 --> 29:09.280
but it's what it did.

29:09.280 --> 29:13.040
It reinforced for me sort of this incredible capacity

29:13.040 --> 29:16.160
we all have as human beings, right?

29:16.160 --> 29:17.920
To do good, right?

29:17.920 --> 29:20.880
To even within the most difficult of circumstances,

29:20.880 --> 29:25.000
to choose who we become and what we do.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.160
And a 10-year-old girl taught me

29:27.160 --> 29:29.160
that'll reinforce that for me.

29:29.160 --> 29:34.160
Were you able to feel the culture of the people,

29:34.200 --> 29:37.360
so the language barrier?

29:37.360 --> 29:39.240
Were you able to break through the language barrier,

29:39.240 --> 29:42.400
the culture barrier, you know, to understand the people?

29:43.480 --> 29:48.480
You know, even suffering has a language of sorts,

29:49.000 --> 29:50.720
depending on where you are.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.840
The way people joke about things,

29:52.840 --> 29:55.840
the way they cry, the way...

29:55.840 --> 29:57.640
This is an interesting thing I actually wanna ask you.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.600
Sorry, I'm asking a million questions.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.760
I find that the people, you know,

30:02.760 --> 30:06.040
I've been talking to people in Ukraine and Russia,

30:06.040 --> 30:09.520
but in general, I've gotten a chance to talk to people

30:09.520 --> 30:12.120
who've been through trauma in their life.

30:13.080 --> 30:18.080
And there's a humor they have about trauma in hard times.

30:21.760 --> 30:22.720
Yeah.

30:22.720 --> 30:25.000
It depends on the culture, of course.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.400
Certainly Russian-speaking folk.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.400
I mean, the more suffering you've experienced,

30:31.400 --> 30:33.720
for some reason, the more they joke about it.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.040
It's almost like they're able to see something deep

30:37.040 --> 30:40.600
about humanity now that they have suffered,

30:40.600 --> 30:42.520
and they're able to laugh at the absurdity,

30:42.520 --> 30:44.280
the injustice of it all.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.960
And, you know, you could also say

30:45.960 --> 30:47.840
it's a way for them to deal with it.

30:47.840 --> 30:52.840
But that humor has a kind of profound,

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
like, understanding within it

30:57.760 --> 30:59.280
about what it means to be human.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.360
That I just...

31:00.360 --> 31:02.480
And then you, to really understand it,

31:02.480 --> 31:04.840
you have to know the language.

31:04.840 --> 31:08.360
I guess I'm asking, were you able to really feel

31:09.320 --> 31:11.760
the humans on the other side of the language?

31:11.760 --> 31:13.000
I'd like to think so.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.720
I mean, as you noted, there are universals in life

31:16.720 --> 31:19.480
that transcend language, right?

31:19.480 --> 31:21.880
I mean, suffering is suffering.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.240
Love is love.

31:23.240 --> 31:28.240
Compassion doesn't take place only through language, right?

31:28.440 --> 31:29.400
It's through actions.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.560
And so, was there a language barrier?

31:31.560 --> 31:33.240
Absolutely, right?

31:33.240 --> 31:36.920
Did we try to bridge that through other means

31:36.920 --> 31:41.240
and sort of universal emotions and experiences?

31:41.240 --> 31:42.480
Absolutely, that's one of the things

31:42.480 --> 31:44.920
I always think about when I'm filming

31:44.920 --> 31:49.760
is how do we distill down to universals, right?

31:49.760 --> 31:51.360
Through imagery, right?

31:51.360 --> 31:54.600
Through the vocabulary of cinema, right?

31:54.600 --> 31:55.640
Because I believe so deeply

31:55.640 --> 31:58.520
that that vocabulary should be visual, right?

31:58.520 --> 32:01.320
So the words, what's the most powerful way

32:01.320 --> 32:03.240
to express the universal?

32:03.240 --> 32:07.880
Is it visual or is it language, words?

32:07.880 --> 32:09.840
I think it's visual.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.640
And we're talking about the human face

32:11.640 --> 32:14.280
or human face, human body, everything.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.560
Through actions as well.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.920
Actions, the dynamic.

32:16.920 --> 32:20.080
I'm thinking about a woman named Salha in the film

32:20.080 --> 32:23.080
who isn't named, but she's,

32:23.080 --> 32:26.120
you see her multiple times throughout the film

32:26.120 --> 32:29.400
and she's basically the matron of the ward in the south.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.560
And she's the gatekeeper for the ward,

32:31.560 --> 32:34.000
so no one enters that ward without her permission.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.040
She's literally the gatekeeper at the door.

32:36.080 --> 32:40.040
So no one comes in unless Salha allows them to come in, right?

32:40.040 --> 32:42.160
But then she also is sort of like

32:43.600 --> 32:47.920
the first point of contact for compassion in the ward.

32:47.920 --> 32:51.560
So when mothers and families are admitted,

32:51.560 --> 32:55.560
she forms relationships between the moms

32:55.560 --> 32:57.560
and the grandmothers, for example,

32:57.560 --> 33:00.240
who are admitted and who are living there on the ward.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.640
And she does it through hugging, right?

33:03.640 --> 33:07.360
She does it through bringing them food, right?

33:07.360 --> 33:12.360
And she forms these really rather quickly deep relationships

33:13.480 --> 33:15.760
of compassion with the families.

33:15.760 --> 33:19.200
And so it's amazing to watch

33:19.200 --> 33:21.280
and no language is needed, right?

33:21.280 --> 33:23.080
To bear witness to this.

33:23.080 --> 33:27.080
And she also suffers because of that, right?

33:27.080 --> 33:29.320
And so near the end of the film,

33:29.320 --> 33:34.080
if you recall, when another child dies

33:34.080 --> 33:35.960
and the mother is wailing,

33:35.960 --> 33:39.080
we actually cut away to Salha, who's in the hallway,

33:39.080 --> 33:43.080
who walks into another room and begins sobbing.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.880
She's not a family member,

33:44.880 --> 33:48.440
but she has a deep relationship with that family

33:48.440 --> 33:51.480
that she forged as soon as they stepped into the ward.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.440
So that's universal, right?

33:53.440 --> 33:58.440
To see a woman weep because a child has died,

33:58.640 --> 34:00.560
even if they're not related to that,

34:00.560 --> 34:03.560
that's a universal sort of emotional experience

34:03.560 --> 34:04.680
we can all relate to.

34:04.680 --> 34:07.560
So that's what I mean by visual vocabulary.

34:07.560 --> 34:08.920
And it's especially powerful

34:08.920 --> 34:12.480
because she has seen much of this kind of suffering

34:12.480 --> 34:17.080
and she's still, maybe she has built up some callous

34:17.080 --> 34:20.080
to be able to work day to day,

34:20.080 --> 34:25.080
but there's still an ocean underneath the ice.

34:25.160 --> 34:28.280
She's kept her heart open despite all the pain

34:28.280 --> 34:30.120
that she sees and feels every day.

34:30.120 --> 34:33.080
Somehow she's a human being who's able to do that,

34:33.080 --> 34:35.440
which is a very difficult thing to do, right?

34:35.440 --> 34:38.080
She still allows herself to be vulnerable

34:39.240 --> 34:41.520
and maybe that's why she can do what she does.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.000
What lessons do you draw from other famines in history?

34:46.000 --> 34:50.560
So for me personally, one that's touched my family

34:50.560 --> 34:54.160
and one of the great famines and histories in Ukraine,

34:54.160 --> 34:56.280
Baltimore in the 30s.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.600
32, 33, right?

34:57.600 --> 34:59.880
32, 33 with Stalin.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.800
Maybe you could speak to the universals

35:01.800 --> 35:03.120
of the suffering here.

35:05.280 --> 35:09.880
What lessons do you draw from those other famines

35:09.880 --> 35:13.280
if you've looked at them or in general about famine

35:13.280 --> 35:17.280
that are manufactured by the decisions of,

35:17.280 --> 35:19.320
let's say, authoritarian leaders?

35:25.120 --> 35:26.920
Famine doesn't have to exist

35:26.920 --> 35:29.000
or the bulk of famines on this planet,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.960
I believe don't have to exist and most of them

35:31.960 --> 35:35.000
or at least a good number of them are manufactured

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
by the leaders that choose to use famine as a weapon, right?

35:40.880 --> 35:45.880
And Ukraine is one of the obvious examples right now

35:46.880 --> 35:48.600
with siege tactics that are happening

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600
in different parts of the country.

35:50.600 --> 35:55.600
We built international humanitarian law for a reason,

35:55.880 --> 35:56.720
right?

35:56.720 --> 36:00.720
Many years ago and it continues to be written to this day.

36:00.720 --> 36:04.680
And it's there to prevent what's happening

36:04.680 --> 36:06.040
in Ukraine right now.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.560
It's there to prevent what's been happening

36:08.560 --> 36:10.880
in Yemen for seven years.

36:10.880 --> 36:14.240
And yet there hasn't been any teeth behind it.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.240
And that's what's happening in Ukraine right now.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.880
There hasn't been any teeth behind it.

36:19.880 --> 36:24.880
And that's what disturbs me is that we can see

36:25.480 --> 36:30.400
how these famines are being used as weapons in war.

36:30.400 --> 36:34.080
And yet we aren't sort of using the levers of power

36:34.080 --> 36:39.080
that exist in order to, I think, to call out

36:39.960 --> 36:44.040
in important and powerful ways those who are causing them

36:44.040 --> 36:46.800
and to make sure that we hold them accountable

36:46.800 --> 36:47.680
on the global stage.

36:47.680 --> 36:51.800
Now, to some extent, that seems to be happening in Ukraine

36:51.800 --> 36:54.360
in a way that hasn't happened for a long time.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.960
And that gives me hope, right?

36:56.960 --> 36:59.440
And yet I don't believe we've done enough.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.640
And I think the international community needs to do

37:02.640 --> 37:06.360
far more than we are both in Yemen, in Ethiopia,

37:06.360 --> 37:08.000
and in Ukraine right now.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.280
There are certain kinds of things that captivate

37:12.280 --> 37:14.160
the global attention.

37:14.160 --> 37:17.040
And it seems like starvation is not always one of them.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.760
For some reason, murder and destruction

37:22.800 --> 37:25.280
gets people's attention more.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.480
The death, of course, is easy to enumerate,

37:28.480 --> 37:30.640
but it's the suffering that's the problem.

37:30.640 --> 37:34.400
Yeah, yeah, you know, when we went to film Hunger Ward,

37:34.400 --> 37:36.680
that was one of the creative questions

37:36.680 --> 37:38.320
that I was really concerned about.

37:38.320 --> 37:43.240
Because starvation, it's not a quick action, right?

37:43.480 --> 37:47.360
It's a long, slow, insidious process, right?

37:47.360 --> 37:49.520
Just like hunger, right?

37:49.520 --> 37:52.400
And yet, when you're hungry, right?

37:53.360 --> 37:55.360
It takes you over.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.000
It becomes the most important thing, right?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.600
It's just absolutely fundamental to life.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.480
It's like drawing breath.

38:02.480 --> 38:06.520
And so I really, before I filmed Hunger Ward,

38:06.520 --> 38:09.200
I struggled to sort of answer

38:09.200 --> 38:11.240
how we could creatively approach that,

38:11.240 --> 38:14.840
because someone sitting in a clinic, right,

38:14.840 --> 38:18.120
starving or being treated for starvation,

38:18.120 --> 38:20.600
that's a pretty static scene, right?

38:21.760 --> 38:25.720
And what we found was that because of the volume of cases

38:25.720 --> 38:28.560
and because of the nature of sort of

38:28.560 --> 38:32.200
how quickly people were coming and going

38:32.200 --> 38:34.640
is that it was more dynamic than we anticipated.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
And there's something also about starvation.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.440
You get tired.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.680
It's almost like, it's a quiet suffering.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.680
Yeah.

38:44.680 --> 38:48.280
Like, and by the way, there's something about,

38:48.280 --> 38:50.200
when I think about dark times,

38:50.200 --> 38:53.360
I mean, you'll hear me chuckle, for example.

38:53.360 --> 38:54.680
I don't know what that is.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.520
That's almost like,

38:58.800 --> 39:02.320
it's almost like you have to kind of laugh at,

39:03.760 --> 39:05.360
you can't help but laugh at like

39:06.880 --> 39:08.840
the injustice and the cruelty in the world

39:08.880 --> 39:10.800
and how that helps your mind deal with it.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.240
I mean, I see this all the time.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.400
Like, when you're struggling, you can't feed your family,

39:16.400 --> 39:17.680
you lost your home.

39:18.680 --> 39:21.600
The last thing you have is jokes about-

39:21.600 --> 39:22.440
It's humor.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.280
Yeah, it's humor.

39:23.280 --> 39:28.200
It's like, ah, the fucking man fucked me over again.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.960
And there's jokes all around that.

39:29.960 --> 39:30.800
Yeah.

39:30.800 --> 39:35.800
And then you laugh and you drink vodka and you play music.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.280
I don't know what that is.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.280
I don't know what that is.

39:38.440 --> 39:39.560
It's gallows humor, right?

39:39.560 --> 39:44.360
It's a way of, I think, simultaneously acknowledging

39:44.360 --> 39:46.800
and allowing yourself to move forward, right?

39:46.800 --> 39:49.840
Beyond the pain and the suffering.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.800
So you mentioned Ukraine and you mentioned Putin.

39:52.800 --> 39:57.800
What are your thoughts about the humanitarian crisis

39:58.360 --> 40:00.720
and generally the suffering that's resulting

40:00.720 --> 40:02.440
from the war in Ukraine?

40:02.440 --> 40:04.000
Well, first off, I think the conflict

40:04.000 --> 40:08.800
is just gonna exacerbate sort of the global challenge

40:08.800 --> 40:12.960
we have with displacement, right?

40:12.960 --> 40:17.560
The last entire trilogy I did was about displacement

40:17.560 --> 40:19.520
to a great extent due to war.

40:19.520 --> 40:23.040
And this is a huge displacement of human beings,

40:23.040 --> 40:24.720
regardless of the cause.

40:24.720 --> 40:29.200
And that is gonna sort of have a ripple effect

40:29.200 --> 40:31.960
across the globe for many, many years to come,

40:31.960 --> 40:34.920
regardless of even if the conflict ended today.

40:34.920 --> 40:38.000
So there's that, that's gonna set up a whole nother strain

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
on sort of the global sort of resources

40:44.000 --> 40:47.720
that come into play to deal with refugees.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.800
You know, there were 79 million displaced people

40:50.800 --> 40:54.760
on this globe prior to the Ukrainian conflict, right?

40:54.760 --> 40:56.600
You probably know the numbers better than I do

40:56.600 --> 40:59.320
in terms of what the current estimates are

40:59.320 --> 41:00.840
for displacement from Ukraine.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.000
74 to 6 million.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.240
So what are we up to now?

41:03.240 --> 41:07.120
73, 74 million individuals on this planet now

41:07.120 --> 41:10.880
who are displaced, that's a significant bump.

41:12.080 --> 41:16.280
I wish that the levers of power were used differently

41:16.280 --> 41:19.720
in situations like Ukraine and Syria, for example.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.440
So what are the levers of power?

41:23.440 --> 41:26.800
Well, military might, let's take that for one, right?

41:26.800 --> 41:31.800
So I have always felt after working in Syria and Turkey

41:34.720 --> 41:39.480
that we completely missed our opportunity

41:39.480 --> 41:44.400
as a player on the global stage with military capability

41:44.400 --> 41:48.760
to prevent the killing of hundreds of thousands

41:48.760 --> 41:50.920
of civilians in Syria.

41:50.920 --> 41:54.680
We had the ability and we didn't leverage that ability.

41:54.680 --> 41:59.680
You know, the fact that I talked with so many Syrians

41:59.760 --> 42:02.080
during the course of doing that project,

42:02.080 --> 42:07.080
who told me their stories of living in their house, right?

42:07.560 --> 42:12.480
And having a Syrian helicopter fly over their house

42:12.480 --> 42:17.080
and drop a 55 gallon drum full of explosives and shrapnel

42:19.280 --> 42:24.080
in their neighborhood over and over and over again.

42:24.120 --> 42:27.680
Not focused on any, you know, military targets,

42:27.680 --> 42:31.560
only meant to kill and so fear, right?

42:31.560 --> 42:35.600
And early in the conflict, we could have stopped that, right?

42:35.600 --> 42:39.120
Before Russia got involved, we could have intervened

42:39.120 --> 42:40.880
and created a no-fly zone.

42:40.880 --> 42:42.000
We, the United States.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.960
We, the United States or coalition that we were a part of.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.440
Yeah, and we didn't do it and we could have.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.560
And I think that's an example where we have

42:49.560 --> 42:52.240
the military capability to actually do good

42:52.240 --> 42:53.520
in a situation like that.

42:53.600 --> 42:55.760
And we don't usually use it for those purposes.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.720
And I think that's what a military ought to be used for

42:58.720 --> 43:00.120
beyond just defending our borders,

43:00.120 --> 43:03.360
is to save others with the privilege

43:03.360 --> 43:04.880
that that power affords.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.480
What do you think about the power of the military

43:07.480 --> 43:09.200
versus the power of sanctions

43:09.200 --> 43:11.240
versus the power of conversation?

43:12.560 --> 43:14.000
They're all different tools, right?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.520
To be used at different moments.

43:15.520 --> 43:20.520
But if words fail, if sanctions fail, right?

43:21.400 --> 43:24.120
I think there are moments in history

43:24.120 --> 43:26.360
where power is justified, right?

43:26.360 --> 43:28.200
And I think Syria was one of them.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.920
I think when barrel bombs were dropping

43:31.920 --> 43:34.760
on civilian neighborhoods for months and months and months

43:34.760 --> 43:37.400
with no intent to do anything

43:37.400 --> 43:40.080
other than kill Syrian civilians,

43:40.080 --> 43:43.600
that's an instance, I think, where might is justified

43:43.600 --> 43:45.360
to shoot those helicopters out of the sky.

43:45.360 --> 43:48.480
Here's the difficult thing, we talked about Yemen.

43:48.560 --> 43:53.160
Where's the line between good and evil

43:53.160 --> 43:56.880
for US intervention in different countries

43:56.880 --> 43:58.600
and conflicts in the world?

43:59.760 --> 44:02.400
It's easy to look back 10, 20, 30 years

44:02.400 --> 44:05.800
to know what was and wasn't a quote unquote just war.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.720
In the moment, how do we know?

44:09.720 --> 44:12.360
I think it's incredibly difficult to answer that, right?

44:12.360 --> 44:14.560
And I think that's why leaders

44:14.560 --> 44:16.720
make the wrong choices so often, right?

44:16.720 --> 44:18.520
Because they second guess themselves.

44:19.840 --> 44:22.440
I think you take all the data at your fingertips,

44:22.440 --> 44:24.400
all the intelligence that you have, right?

44:24.400 --> 44:26.760
And you look at it all very carefully

44:26.760 --> 44:28.800
and you make a decision, right?

44:28.800 --> 44:31.200
There are some instances though

44:31.200 --> 44:34.800
where it's very clear what's happening, right?

44:34.800 --> 44:37.160
And leaders still don't act, right?

44:37.160 --> 44:39.400
In Yemen right now, for example,

44:39.400 --> 44:41.640
it's very clear what's happening, right?

44:41.640 --> 44:44.280
Children are being starved because of a blockade.

44:45.120 --> 44:48.960
All the US would have to do is ensure that blockade,

44:48.960 --> 44:50.960
now there's a two month ceasefire in place now,

44:50.960 --> 44:54.640
but remains lifted beyond that ceasefire

44:54.640 --> 44:56.960
and children will stop starving.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.520
That's pretty simple.

44:58.520 --> 45:01.280
You can trace, it's a direct connection.

45:01.280 --> 45:04.960
And we haven't had the sort of the moral wherewithal

45:04.960 --> 45:08.040
to make that decision because we're too interested

45:08.040 --> 45:10.920
in maintaining positive ties with Saudi Arabia

45:10.920 --> 45:14.400
where oil flows from and so much influence

45:16.040 --> 45:17.680
because Saudi Arabia has so much influence

45:17.680 --> 45:19.920
throughout the MENA region.

45:19.920 --> 45:22.160
We want to keep that relationship tight

45:22.160 --> 45:26.360
despite sort of the moral wounds that come from that.

45:26.360 --> 45:30.600
About half the world is under authoritarian regimes.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.440
Everybody operates under narratives.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.800
And there's a narrative in the United States

45:35.800 --> 45:38.920
that freedom is good, democracy is good.

45:39.880 --> 45:43.600
I have fallen victim to this narrative.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.720
I believe in it.

45:46.040 --> 45:48.640
I'm saying this jokingly, but not really.

45:49.640 --> 45:53.120
Because who knows the truth of anything in this world?

45:54.040 --> 45:57.040
I eat meat, factory farm meat,

45:57.040 --> 45:59.800
and I seem to not be intellectually

45:59.800 --> 46:02.600
and philosophically tortured by this and I should be.

46:02.600 --> 46:05.000
There's a lot of suffering there.

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
What do we do to lessen the suffering of the people

46:10.000 --> 46:11.600
under authoritarian regimes?

46:12.640 --> 46:16.280
Again, the same question, military conflict,

46:18.200 --> 46:21.760
diplomacy, sanctions, all those kinds of things.

46:24.400 --> 46:28.600
Does that lessen suffering or increase the suffering

46:28.600 --> 46:30.280
from what you see in Yemen?

46:31.280 --> 46:35.760
Is it something that has to be healed across generations

46:35.760 --> 46:38.720
or can be healed on a scale of months and years?

46:38.720 --> 46:41.600
I'm just a guy with camera legs, you know?

46:41.600 --> 46:42.960
But as a guy with a camera,

46:43.960 --> 46:48.960
I've seen a lot of things in a lot of places

46:48.960 --> 46:53.800
and I've seen the effects these decisions made

46:53.800 --> 46:58.800
by authoritarian leaders have on their own citizens.

46:59.320 --> 47:02.560
And that's what drives my thinking on this.

47:04.480 --> 47:08.360
And that's what drives and motivates me each day

47:08.360 --> 47:12.480
to raise the red flag through my films and say,

47:12.480 --> 47:17.480
listen, Biden, you campaigned for president

47:20.360 --> 47:23.520
in part on a platform that said

47:23.520 --> 47:26.960
that we would regain our prominence

47:26.960 --> 47:29.360
on the moral stage of the world

47:29.360 --> 47:34.360
and that we would prioritize sort of a moral paradigm

47:36.440 --> 47:40.200
over relationships with authoritarian regimes,

47:40.200 --> 47:42.280
Saudi Arabia being one.

47:42.280 --> 47:45.760
And yet when the CIA report came out

47:45.760 --> 47:48.800
that clearly articulated in detail

47:48.800 --> 47:52.120
that MBS was responsible for Khashoggi's murder

47:52.120 --> 47:54.280
and for cutting his body into pieces

47:54.640 --> 47:58.240
and probably burning it in the backyard of the embassy.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.320
What did Biden do?

48:00.280 --> 48:03.160
He didn't really make a pariah out of MBS

48:03.160 --> 48:05.880
like he said he was going to, right?

48:05.880 --> 48:07.680
What if he'd done something else

48:07.680 --> 48:09.960
and actually done what he said he was gonna do,

48:09.960 --> 48:10.800
which was make him,

48:10.800 --> 48:14.400
what if he would remove the ability for MBS

48:14.400 --> 48:17.160
to fly to the United States, for example?

48:17.160 --> 48:18.800
Now that's a sanction, right?

48:18.800 --> 48:22.480
That's a sanction that's individual and concrete

48:22.480 --> 48:25.840
and would be hugely embarrassing for MBS.

48:25.840 --> 48:28.040
That would have been Biden saying

48:28.040 --> 48:31.920
this is unacceptable behavior, right?

48:31.920 --> 48:36.280
This is something which because you executed

48:36.280 --> 48:39.360
such a horrendous act on someone living

48:39.360 --> 48:41.640
in the United States, right?

48:41.640 --> 48:46.640
We are not going to give you a stage here at least, right?

48:47.480 --> 48:49.640
Within the borders of our country.

48:49.640 --> 48:51.840
Those are the things that leaders can do

48:51.840 --> 48:53.760
that I don't think they do often enough.

48:53.760 --> 48:55.560
And certainly our leader right now

48:55.560 --> 48:57.680
isn't doing it in the way I wish he were.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.360
He certainly has taken a different stand on Ukraine

49:02.160 --> 49:03.560
and been very vocal.

49:03.560 --> 49:05.920
But there's so many instances we could talk about

49:05.920 --> 49:10.520
where I feel like the political gamemanship, right?

49:10.520 --> 49:13.920
Often falls into maintaining relationships

49:13.920 --> 49:15.680
like with MBS and Saudi Arabia

49:15.680 --> 49:17.320
rather than doing the right thing.

49:17.320 --> 49:21.440
Rather than as a nation, a leader of a nation saying

49:21.440 --> 49:22.920
this is unacceptable.

49:22.920 --> 49:24.840
We have a higher standard than this.

49:24.840 --> 49:27.760
Because I think when leaders do that,

49:29.120 --> 49:31.080
it becomes aspirational, right?

49:31.080 --> 49:33.480
It becomes aspirational for other leaders

49:35.120 --> 49:36.680
in the progressive world at least.

49:36.680 --> 49:39.120
And also it rings the alarm bells

49:39.120 --> 49:42.160
for other authoritarian leaders and says,

49:42.160 --> 49:44.680
you know what, there are lines, right?

49:44.680 --> 49:46.720
There are things that can't be done

49:46.720 --> 49:48.640
or there will be significant consequences.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.960
You will not be able to fly into our airspace anymore.

49:51.960 --> 49:54.880
And sanctions I think need to be concrete

49:54.880 --> 49:58.520
and individual in addition to the larger scope.

49:58.520 --> 50:01.280
But when they're concrete and individual,

50:01.280 --> 50:04.880
I think often they're felt in a different way.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.280
You mean felt obviously by the individuals

50:07.280 --> 50:09.840
and so the ripple effects of that

50:12.120 --> 50:17.120
might have the power to steer the direction of nations.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.960
Because of the nature of authoritarian regimes, right?

50:21.960 --> 50:23.280
Individuals have so much power.

50:23.280 --> 50:24.360
Exactly, right.

50:24.360 --> 50:29.360
So if Putin is put on trial in the Hague at some point

50:30.800 --> 50:32.600
or at least there's the threat of that, right?

50:32.600 --> 50:34.840
Now that's likely never to happen of course

50:34.840 --> 50:37.680
because someone has to be in custody to go on trial, right?

50:37.680 --> 50:39.800
And he's never gonna allow that to happen.

50:39.800 --> 50:44.800
But just knowing that danger exists

50:45.800 --> 50:50.200
is going to change his travel plans in the future, right?

50:50.200 --> 50:52.440
MBS not being able to fly to the US,

50:52.440 --> 50:55.240
he's gonna feel that and be embarrassed by that.

50:56.400 --> 51:00.360
So I think they have a special meaning

51:00.360 --> 51:04.040
and consequence in authoritarian regimes because of that.

51:04.040 --> 51:06.080
So you said you're just a guy with a camera?

51:06.080 --> 51:06.920
Yeah.

51:07.800 --> 51:12.800
I would say you're a brilliant guy with a camera.

51:13.800 --> 51:15.880
I'm also a kind of guy with a camera.

51:15.880 --> 51:16.880
You're a guy with a couple of cameras.

51:16.880 --> 51:18.240
A couple of cameras, I have work.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.320
Couple of mics too.

51:20.320 --> 51:22.200
You got a couple of mics, a couple of cameras.

51:22.200 --> 51:23.040
Robot over here.

51:23.040 --> 51:25.480
When you can't beat him with quality,

51:25.480 --> 51:27.160
you bring the quantity.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.360
That's right.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.240
So to me, that's also an interest

51:31.240 --> 51:34.480
partially because I also speak Russian

51:34.480 --> 51:36.000
and a bit Ukrainian.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.760
I wanna study that part of the world.

51:39.760 --> 51:41.520
I wanna talk to a lot of people.

51:41.680 --> 51:42.920
I wanna talk to the leaders.

51:42.920 --> 51:44.560
I wanna talk to regular people.

51:44.560 --> 51:48.720
To be honest, and I would love to get your comments on this,

51:48.720 --> 51:51.400
the regular quote unquote people

51:51.400 --> 51:53.480
are way more fascinating to me.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.560
As a filmmaker, how do you figure out

51:56.560 --> 51:58.400
how to tell this story?

51:58.400 --> 52:00.320
I'm sure a guy with a camera,

52:00.320 --> 52:02.440
you're looking at war in Ukraine,

52:02.440 --> 52:05.960
but also what's going on in Yemen and Syria

52:05.960 --> 52:07.160
and other places in the world.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.440
I mentioned North Korea.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.320
That's a super interesting one.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.800
Hard to bring cameras along.

52:11.800 --> 52:16.600
China, like in Canada, the truckers.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.480
There's all kinds of fascinating things

52:18.480 --> 52:19.800
happening in the world.

52:19.800 --> 52:23.800
So you as a scholar of human suffering

52:23.800 --> 52:25.080
and human flourishing,

52:26.360 --> 52:28.360
how do you choose how to tell the story?

52:29.240 --> 52:30.160
How do I choose a story?

52:30.160 --> 52:31.280
How do I choose how to tell the story?

52:31.280 --> 52:34.480
Both a story and how, I assume those are coupled.

52:35.960 --> 52:38.120
So how do you choose which story to tell

52:38.120 --> 52:40.960
and how do you choose how to tell that story?

52:40.960 --> 52:42.040
Yeah.

52:42.040 --> 52:45.680
Well, in terms of how to choose which story,

52:48.400 --> 52:51.840
it's a bit of a mystery potion for me, frankly.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.600
I go off and on instinct,

52:55.600 --> 52:58.880
but there's also a highly intentional piece of it

52:58.880 --> 53:00.200
for me as well.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.360
And the intentional piece is,

53:03.400 --> 53:06.920
I guess I'd call it the do I care threshold

53:06.920 --> 53:08.560
or the so what threshold.

53:08.560 --> 53:11.320
You personally, just something in your heart

53:11.320 --> 53:14.480
just kind of gets excited or hurts

53:14.480 --> 53:15.720
or just feels something.

53:15.720 --> 53:17.400
So one of the things that disturbs me

53:17.400 --> 53:18.800
about American culture, Lex,

53:18.800 --> 53:21.440
is that we seem to be a people

53:21.440 --> 53:24.200
that's fascinated by reality television, for example.

53:24.200 --> 53:27.720
Like look at how many of us here in America

53:28.720 --> 53:31.240
watch reality television, right?

53:31.240 --> 53:32.600
That deeply disturbs me.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.280
Not that I've never watched an episode.

53:34.280 --> 53:36.960
I've shot a whole season of it once to make a living, right?

53:36.960 --> 53:39.480
So it's like, I know it, right?

53:39.480 --> 53:43.560
But I feel like the things we should be paying attention to

53:43.560 --> 53:45.720
are the things, personally,

53:45.720 --> 53:48.800
are the things I choose to film, right?

53:48.800 --> 53:53.800
As a human being, as a dad, as a filmmaker,

53:54.440 --> 53:56.800
I think we should be paying attention

53:56.800 --> 53:59.520
to the fact that children are being starved in Yemen.

53:59.520 --> 54:01.160
I think we should be paying attention

54:01.160 --> 54:03.920
to the fact that Ukrainians are being displaced

54:03.920 --> 54:05.240
by the millions.

54:05.240 --> 54:07.680
So there's this so what threshold that I use.

54:07.680 --> 54:10.200
And I feel like it has to be a topic

54:10.200 --> 54:14.720
that if we don't cover and we don't put out in the world

54:14.720 --> 54:16.800
in the largest possible way,

54:16.800 --> 54:18.240
in the hope of intervening,

54:18.240 --> 54:20.960
in the hope of marshaling maximum resources

54:20.960 --> 54:23.400
and attention to solving the problem,

54:23.400 --> 54:26.480
that's what I'm dedicated to as a filmmaker.

54:26.480 --> 54:29.880
Because I didn't pick up a camera initially

54:29.880 --> 54:32.520
to film puppy dogs, right?

54:32.520 --> 54:34.120
To make people smile.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.120
I believe the camera is a tool for change.

54:37.120 --> 54:40.800
I believe the camera is a powerful tool

54:40.800 --> 54:44.880
that we can use to raise awareness and marshal resources

54:44.880 --> 54:48.320
and help people understand the impact

54:48.320 --> 54:50.760
that these geopolitical decisions have

54:50.760 --> 54:52.440
on real people's lives.

54:52.440 --> 54:57.440
And that's the intent I create each film with.

54:58.120 --> 54:59.960
Now, how I choose each story,

54:59.960 --> 55:02.480
that's the magic potion piece of it, right?

55:02.480 --> 55:05.440
And often one flows rather organically

55:05.440 --> 55:07.280
into another, frankly.

55:07.280 --> 55:08.760
So you just kinda, like you said,

55:08.760 --> 55:10.560
you go with instinct a little bit.

55:10.560 --> 55:13.560
To some extent, but oftentimes I choose the next project

55:13.560 --> 55:17.560
based on relationships I've developed in the last film.

55:18.840 --> 55:21.200
And so one often flows into another

55:21.200 --> 55:22.440
through relationships I develop.

55:22.440 --> 55:25.080
And then a colleague will share a detail

55:25.080 --> 55:27.880
about something that's happening in a certain place.

55:27.880 --> 55:31.320
And I'll go, hmm, really, I didn't know that, right?

55:31.320 --> 55:34.360
And usually it's before it's hit the world stage

55:34.360 --> 55:35.360
in a big way.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.280
And so I start to do due diligence.

55:37.280 --> 55:39.840
And often that, it reveals it to be a much bigger

55:39.840 --> 55:44.160
and more pressing topic that I wanna learn more about.

55:45.640 --> 55:50.640
Before I talked to you about Syria and lifeboat,

55:52.000 --> 55:54.160
you mentioned a camera is the best weapon.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Maybe you just.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.280
Well, I can't take out a tank, right?

55:59.280 --> 56:00.120
But it's a good weapon.

56:00.120 --> 56:01.720
Second, top three.

56:02.640 --> 56:04.640
I love the humor throughout this.

56:04.640 --> 56:06.640
I really appreciate it.

56:06.640 --> 56:08.640
We were talking about such dark topics.

56:11.360 --> 56:14.480
It resets the mind in a way that allows me to think.

56:14.480 --> 56:15.360
So thank you.

56:18.680 --> 56:20.160
As a filmmaker,

56:21.160 --> 56:26.160
I almost wanna talk about the technical details.

56:26.240 --> 56:31.240
How do you choose to shoot stuff?

56:31.280 --> 56:33.760
Again, so maybe you can explain to me.

56:34.800 --> 56:36.960
I work with incredible folks

56:36.960 --> 56:41.960
that care about lenses and equipment and so on.

56:42.880 --> 56:47.880
I tend to be somebody that just wants to kinda

56:48.400 --> 56:51.880
go as like a gorilla shooting.

56:51.880 --> 56:56.880
Like not plan too much, just go with gritty.

56:57.480 --> 56:59.880
I'm trying to come up with words that sound positive.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.920
Do a positive spin on what I try to do.

57:02.920 --> 57:06.200
But like gritty, don't over plan.

57:06.200 --> 57:09.680
Use, like we had a big discussion if you see this light.

57:09.680 --> 57:14.680
It's on a stand that's a very ghetto stand.

57:14.680 --> 57:15.520
It's cheap.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.360
You need a sandbag on that, man.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.200
Exactly.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.080
So no, see, no sandbag.

57:21.080 --> 57:23.800
And like the stand is actually bending

57:23.800 --> 57:25.240
under the weight of that thing.

57:25.240 --> 57:26.400
It could fall on us.

57:26.400 --> 57:27.240
It could fall.

57:27.240 --> 57:28.240
It probably won't reach us, but it could fall.

57:28.240 --> 57:30.920
But the danger, live under that danger.

57:30.920 --> 57:32.680
Embrace that danger.

57:32.680 --> 57:33.520
Love it.

57:34.400 --> 57:36.520
Because that thing is easier to transport

57:36.520 --> 57:38.120
than a heavier one.

57:38.120 --> 57:40.280
Sandbag, that's extra weight.

57:40.280 --> 57:42.880
So if you keep, like people tell me

57:42.880 --> 57:44.680
there's the right way to do stuff.

57:44.720 --> 57:47.400
Like here's these giant cases with all the kinds

57:47.400 --> 57:49.320
of padding for transporting stuff.

57:49.320 --> 57:52.520
I transport most of the equipment in a garbage bag.

57:52.520 --> 57:56.280
So that's just a preference because that's somehow

57:56.280 --> 58:00.720
that chaos allows me to ignore all the stupidity

58:00.720 --> 58:04.840
of loving the equipment and focusing on the story.

58:04.840 --> 58:09.840
So that said, I've never shot anything like worthwhile.

58:10.840 --> 58:15.680
Like there is power to the visual.

58:15.680 --> 58:16.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:16.520 --> 58:17.720
Like definitely.

58:17.720 --> 58:22.720
And so finding a certain angle, a certain light

58:23.000 --> 58:24.400
where there's natural light

58:24.400 --> 58:29.040
or additional artificial lighting, just capturing a tear.

58:29.040 --> 58:33.160
Capturing when the person forgets themselves

58:33.160 --> 58:36.080
for a moment and looks out into the distance,

58:36.080 --> 58:38.800
missing somebody, thinking about somebody.

58:38.840 --> 58:42.640
All of those moments you can capture, a lens,

58:42.640 --> 58:45.280
a camera can do magic with that.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.800
I don't even know the question I'm asking you,

58:46.800 --> 58:51.520
but how do both technical and philosophical,

58:51.520 --> 58:54.600
how do you capture the visual power that you're after?

58:54.600 --> 58:59.360
Yeah, so many of my films, I think,

58:59.360 --> 59:03.360
are built on the premise of access, right?

59:03.360 --> 59:05.080
Built on this notion that

59:05.600 --> 59:10.600
the biggest hurdle to the story is getting there.

59:13.080 --> 59:17.640
Being there in the room or being there on the boat

59:17.640 --> 59:20.240
while a crisis is unfolding.

59:20.240 --> 59:23.520
And that access typically is really nuanced

59:23.520 --> 59:26.360
and difficult to gain.

59:26.360 --> 59:29.280
And then trust flows from that, right?

59:29.280 --> 59:32.200
Because usually it takes a long time to gain that access.

59:33.120 --> 59:35.760
Because that access is so hard fought,

59:37.360 --> 59:42.360
it necessarily informs how we film, right?

59:43.720 --> 59:47.720
To be in a room at Sadaka Hospital in Southern Yemen,

59:47.720 --> 59:51.120
I can't have five people in that room, right?

59:51.120 --> 59:54.560
I can't have a boom mic over a scene.

59:55.960 --> 59:59.600
I want creatively the opposite of that as well.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.360
So it's not just a logistical question,

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.560
it's also a creative question.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.320
To capture intimate moments where

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.760
families are dealing with suffering children

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:13.080
and dying children and caretaking is active

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.720
and ongoing all the time,

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.680
you don't want to interrupt that moment.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.760
And so that informs how I do things.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.680
So we go fleet and nimble and small.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.800
Those are all really good words for.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.800
But so it's logistical on the one hand,

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.840
but it's also a creative choice, right?

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.080
So when we filmed Hunger Ward,

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.520
two people were filming the entire film, right?

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.560
Me and my director of photography.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.960
That was the two people in the room?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.040
Two people in the room.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.960
Yeah, that's it, the whole film, right?

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.240
We had a field producer as well

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.120
and he's part of the country.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.320
But in terms of camera, it's just two people.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.240
And we're doing everything and we have lenses

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.720
that are long enough that we don't have to move

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.680
to capture the film.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.640
So we can tuck into a corner sometimes, right?

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.480
And just.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.320
So what's long mean?

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.640
That means they're standing farther away and they can.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.280
Zoom lens, it's not a prime lens.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.080
So it's not a fixed focal length, right?

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:04.960
Cause a fixed focal length,

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.760
you have to move a lot more in order to capture action.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.760
With a zoom lens, maybe a 105 at the long end,

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.880
I can tuck into a corner and just film from 15 feet away

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.040
instead of having to get right up on someone, right?

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.000
So you less like to interrupt the scene

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.960
and you can kind of become the fly on the wall sometimes.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.280
So, you know, I'm very intentional about that piece of it

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.640
so that we can capture those vulnerable moments

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.760
and not interrupt them.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.800
That's really fascinating too, cause the access.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:42.960
I don't often think about this,

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.960
but that's probably true for me as well.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.240
Part of the storytelling is to be in the room.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.760
And that's the hard part.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.440
For me, most of my films, that's the hardest part.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.920
Actually as hard as Hunger Ward and Lifeboat were to film

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.400
and 15 Feet From Syria,

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.800
the getting there piece of it for the last two

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.240
was much harder.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.440
Yeah, and it's also, it's a creative act.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.600
It's, I don't know if it is for you,

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.200
but it's the kind of people you talk to.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.680
It's like how you live your life.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.120
Like the kind of people I talk to right now,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.800
they steer the direction of my life

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.680
and steer the direction of things I'll film.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.360
So like, it's not just like you're trying to get access.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.600
It's like, it's everything.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.360
It's like, it builds, it builds and builds and builds.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.200
Builds on itself.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.840
I mean, part of the thing, even saying, you know,

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.200
talking about some of these leaders

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.920
and conversations with them,

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.040
it's almost like steering your life

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.840
into the direction of the difficult,

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.080
of like taking the leap

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.720
and if you're a good human being

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.440
and a lot of people know who you are as a human,

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.120
like not as a name, but as really who you are,

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.920
that like putting that attention out there,

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.960
it's somehow the world opens doors

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.240
where the access becomes,

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.520
the access that was once seemed impossible becomes possible

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.080
and then all of that is a creative journey

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.200
to be in the room.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.680
I think that probably is,

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.680
I mean, it's true even for fiction films probably,

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.240
is like everything that led to that,

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.880
like to be in the room,

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.080
the journey to be in the room and to shoot the scene

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.800
is maybe more important than the scene itself

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.920
and like really focus on the creative act of that.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.040
Yeah, that's really fascinating

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.040
and especially, I mean, with a documentary,

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.760
you get one take.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.080
Yeah, you can't say, hey, reset, right?

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.240
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.200
God, that is so interesting

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.040
as you're in some of the most difficult parts of the world

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.840
in the room with some of the most difficult stories

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.120
to be told.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.600
And yet, I think that's why I keep doing these stories,

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.280
right, because once you have that lived experience,

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.120
for me,

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.880
it's moving.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.800
It moves me to bear witness

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:25.800
to these inspiring people under difficult circumstances

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:31.800
and I can't come back to the US afterwards

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.880
and walk down the grocery aisle

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.440
where there's 50 different choices for canned peas, right?

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:45.320
And not sort of feel that lived tension, right?

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.520
That lived tension of the privilege

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.440
that I have here in the US

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:52.320
and then I have a choice about what to do

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.240
with that privilege, right?

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.720
And the last thing I wanna do is start

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:01.360
doing stories about dandelions, right?

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.960
There's far more important things to do

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.960
on this very limited time that I have on the planet

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:10.960
and I think that's catalytic for me.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:15.120
I feel that mortality each day

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:20.120
and my goal is to tell as many of these stories

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.120
before I'm gone.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:28.360
Could you speak to the getting access?

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:33.360
Is this just, you know, is there interesting stories

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.360
of how a weird or funny,

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.400
or profound ways that led you to get access to a room?

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.080
Each one is a different adventure

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:44.920
and it's definitely an adventure.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.760
It's an adventure.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.120
Everyone's an adventure, yeah.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.120
Probably one of the easiest ones I ever had

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.080
in the recent past was for 50 feet from Syria

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:57.080
where I literally broke my hand in a bicycle race

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.280
and after many months of trying to get an appointment

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.200
with an orthopedic hand surgeon, you know,

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.880
an appointment with an orthopedic hand surgeon,

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.920
you know, a specialist, I finally did

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.680
and he was Syrian-American

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.840
and the Syrian conflict had just begun

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.600
and we just started talking about it

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.880
and after, you know, he looked at my hand

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.320
in the first five minutes, he's like,

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.240
yeah, you need surgery, right, great.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.840
But then somehow we started talking about Syria

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.360
and like five minutes in, he just stood up

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.680
and like put the privacy curtain around us,

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.040
supposed to be a 15 minute appointment or so

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.360
and we talked for an hour, right?

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.360
So, you know, those moments

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.800
of sort of mysterious confluence happen, right?

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.320
And I think you have to be open to them when they do happen

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.720
because I'm a storyteller, I'm always looking as well, right?

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.040
So, because he then contacted me later

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.840
and said, Sky, I am going back to the Syrian border

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.560
to volunteer as a surgeon, do you want to come with me?

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.400
That was an easy one.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.920
That's probably the easiest one I could give you

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.160
but it came out of this interesting moment,

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.880
very personal moment, right?

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.120
Lifeboat and Hunger Ward were completely different

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.400
and I had to really work hard

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.360
to gain access to those stories.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.320
So you intentionally thought like what,

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.320
I want to get access to the story

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.480
and then what are the different ideas?

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.440
And they often might involve a doctor or a dentist

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:29.440
or just being maybe intentionally and aggressively open

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:34.320
to experiences that lead you into the room.

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.920
So like, it's funny you mentioned the doctor

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.760
because I have similar experiences now.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.720
I've just gotten access to all kinds of fascinating people

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.040
in the same way.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:50.880
They're all around us.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.640
They're all around us, you just have to look, right?

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.560
It's like there's fascinating people everywhere

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.280
who are doing incredible things

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:59.520
but we have to be open and keep our eyes open

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.200
and realize that there are amazing human beings everywhere.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.760
Yeah, there's networks that connect people

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.120
just through life.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.600
You meet people, you share a beer or a drink

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:17.600
or just you fall in love or you share trauma together,

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.960
you go through a hard time together

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.600
and those little sticky things connects us humans

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.880
and if you just keep yourself open

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.880
and embrace the curiosity

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.040
and then also the persistence, I suppose.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.040
Like if you, like how long have you chased access?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.640
Does it take days, weeks, months, years?

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.080
Like I'm not the most talented filmmaker in the world.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.160
I'm not the smartest guy in the world.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.360
I think if there's qualities that have served me well

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.200
in my career, it's persistence and tenacity, right?

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.960
I've always been sort of a slow burn human being.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.240
Like I would never hit a home run

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.240
but I hit a first, right?

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.560
A single to first and then I'd hit another single to first.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.480
So I ran a marathon when I was 18

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.520
and I think that is illustrative

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.440
of sort of how my career has been.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:18.320
I just keep going and I believe in this notion

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.760
of incremental evolution that with each project,

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:26.000
I try to learn from it and take away lessons learned

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.240
and improve my craft, right?

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.040
And improve how I leverage that craft

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.360
and improve how I tell the story

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.920
from a narrative standpoint each time

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.840
so that on the next project, it's a little bit better

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.200
and that's the arc of my career is learning, learning,

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.840
evolving, evolving so that I can make

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.560
a little better film the next time.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.480
How do you gain people's trust?

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.640
Like for example, there's a line between journalists

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.680
and documentary filmmakers.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.360
Nobody really trusts journalists.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.880
Yeah, right, exactly.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.760
But a documentary filmmaker, of course I'm joking,

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.000
half joking, I don't know which percentage joking

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.480
but some truth, but a documentary filmmaker

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:16.880
is a kind of storyteller, an artist.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.920
Now somehow that's more trustworthy

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.600
because you're on the same side in some way.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.440
I don't know.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.400
Maybe on the same side, yeah.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.400
Maybe.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.520
Is there something to be said

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.280
in how you gain the trust of people to gain access?

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.840
Are you just trying to be a good human being?

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.600
Is there something to be said there?

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.400
Well, so I do draw a distinction

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.160
between journalism and filmmaking

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.560
because I think you're right, they're different.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:45.200
And there are some filmmakers who do hew to

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.920
sort of the journalistic tenants

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.640
of who, what, where, when, why,

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.440
fair and balanced on both sides, right?

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.800
Make sure everyone has a voice.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:53.640
I don't.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.120
If you say fair and balanced,

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.320
you're rarely either fair or balanced.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.720
I've seen that with journalists.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.840
Journalists often, unfortunately, in my perspective,

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.560
sorry to interrupt you rudely and go on a rant,

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:09.800
but they seem to have an agenda

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.200
as opposed to seeking to truly tell a story

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.560
or to truly understand.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.080
Especially when they're talking to people

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.280
who have some degree of evil in them.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.800
Well, we all have an agenda, right?

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.080
I think in anything we do,

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.520
whether it's like to seek truth

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.520
or some larger principle, I always have an agenda.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.080
Like I chose to work with civilians and caretakers

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.880
in Yemen on Hunger Ward

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.720
rather than to go interview MBS, right?

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.960
That's what I'm interested in

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.280
is bringing that to the world, right?

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:55.600
But in terms of building relationships and trust,

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:59.120
it's really, I think about transparency

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.720
as much as anything else

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.360
and going in in a collaborative sense.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.360
So I don't think of the people

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.600
of the people that I film with as subjects, for example.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.360
I think of them as collaborators.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.680
So it's a different mindset that I go into projects with.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.520
That's beautiful.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.880
And it's based on relationships, right?

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.280
You have to build relationships with other human beings,

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.920
however you can, and that takes time

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.680
and it takes listening and it's active.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.960
So I've talked about the notion of consent before,

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.680
which is so important in non-fiction film.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:39.920
And I hew to this idea

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:43.840
that you don't just slide a piece of paper

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.920
in front of someone, have a lease form

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.240
and have them sign it, right?

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.560
And then you're done.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:51.760
That's not the nature of true consent in my mind.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.760
It's you have to work on a foundation of active consent

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.200
every single day that you're working with someone.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.280
And that's based on relationship, right?

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.560
And it's based on dialogue.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:05.840
So it's trust that I'm always aiming for.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.840
It's the building of relationships,

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.680
which I'm always aiming for,

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.240
which is why yesterday I got a bunch of photos

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.400
from Dr. Al-Sadiq in the south of Yemen.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.440
And she sends me photos all the time

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.000
of the children that she's currently treating

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.800
because we have an active relationship

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.240
that continues on and probably will for many years to come.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.400
So it's going to continue.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.040
And that's the only way that I can do these kinds of films.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:36.720
Let me ask you about silly little details of filming

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.440
before we go to the big picture stories.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.120
Cameras, lenses, do those, how much do those matter?

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.920
You mentioned director of photography.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.920
What's your, how much do you love the feel,

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.960
the smell of equipment that does the visual filming?

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.120
You know, there's some people, they're just like,

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.080
ah, they love lenses.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.440
How much do you love that or versus how much do you focus

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.000
on the story or access and all those kinds of things?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I'm not a tech geek, but because during the bulk

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:18.440
of my career, I've worked as a director of photography

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.520
myself for other people in order to pay the bills

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.360
over the years.

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.640
You know, I know the technical side of it

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:29.000
because I've had to know it and I've had to train myself

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:29.840
and learn it.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.680
So I see them as necessary tools.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.680
And again, because I believe, you know, film and cinema

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:45.280
is and should be visually driven and not verbally driven.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.440
I want the best tools possible within my means, right?

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.840
And within the logistical ability of the project

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.160
because we have to go so small, right?

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.880
I can't afford nor can I bring a huge $100,000 lens.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.840
So if I gave you a trillion dollars.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:03.800
A trillion dollars?

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.640
Yeah.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.480
Wow.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.320
Unlimited.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.160
Yeah.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.640
There's still huge constraints that have nothing to do

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.480
with money.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.320
Yeah.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.160
Like you just said.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.840
So what cameras would you use?

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.080
You know what I'd do with a trillion dollars?

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.920
I could do a lot with a trillion dollars.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.760
You're only allowed to fund the film and no corrupt stuff

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.920
where you like use the film to actually help children.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.440
No, you're not allowed to do any of that.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.560
What I would do with a trillion is I wouldn't invest in it.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.320
Well, I guess I would invest in,

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.480
I would increase capacity to do more films.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.320
What I would do.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.640
So I would buy basically the perfect little, you know,

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.760
mini equipment set, right?

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.960
But then I would train three teams maybe

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.960
to do the same thing that I've been doing

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.320
so we could multiply and scale up.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.280
More and more stories.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.040
Yeah, that's what I would do with the money.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.520
But the actual setup.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:54.720
Would remain small and nimble.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.560
Yeah.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:59.840
And what about lighting?

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.840
Do you usually use natural light?

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.160
Do you ever do?

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.360
I mean, sorry for the technical questions here,

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.360
but highlighting the drama of the human face.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:12.640
Yeah.

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.600
That's the visual, that's art.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.840
That's like to reveal reality.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.680
Yeah.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.120
At its deepest is art.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.840
Do you use lighting?

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.160
Lighting is such a big part of that.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.520
Do you ever do artificial lighting?

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.160
Do you try to do natural always?

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.280
You know the best lighting instrument in the world?

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.800
Is the sun.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.000
At the right moment of the day.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.800
And so I predominantly use natural light

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:48.160
at certain moments and just shape natural light

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.800
during the course of these small human rights docs.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.760
That's not to say we don't bring instruments sometimes,

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:59.760
but when we do, they're very small and again, compact.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.080
So for example, I have this small little tube kit

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.080
that's just three instruments, right?

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.480
That you can charge with USB.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.960
Because electricity is often a major issue where we go.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.560
So there's just three little tube lights

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.920
with magnetic backs that if we find in a situation

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.320
where we can't get enough exposure

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.000
for a hallway or something and we have the time

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.320
to throw it up, we'll throw it up if people are walking,

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:27.200
if collaborators are walking down that hallway a lot,

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.040
for example, at night, just so we can see them, right?

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.560
So it's instances like that.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.640
Or if we do do an interview, which we don't do very often,

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.640
but if we do, just so we have a key light on the face, right?

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.440
And always bring a reflector or two, you know,

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.880
just to shape natural light as well in ways.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.880
But it's about shaping rather than producing light for us.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.880
Got it, as we sit surrounded by black curtains

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.640
in complete natural light.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.640
So just so you know, this room is like a violation

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.520
of the basic principles of using the sun.

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:13.160
So behind the large curtains are giant windows.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.000
Yeah.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
So this whole.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:15.840
Should I rip them open?

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.120
Should I rip open the curtains real quick?

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.440
How much of the work is done in the edit?

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.320
That's another question I'm curious about.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.960
And how much do you sort of anticipate that?

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.800
Like when you're actually shooting,

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.800
are you thinking of the final story as it appears on screen?

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.880
Or are you just collecting as a human,

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:43.200
collecting little bits of story here and then

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:46.600
in the edit is where most of the storytelling happens?

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.160
I've developed this sort of mental paradigm for myself

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.000
over the years that speaks to that.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.760
And I call it the three creations, right?

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.760
And so when I'm doing a film, the first creation for me is,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.880
you know, my preconception or visualization

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:09.480
of what the film is going to be before I shoot it, right?

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:14.200
So I have this entire vision of what a film's going to be.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.960
And sometimes it can be pretty specific.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.680
Like I'll think through the scenes

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.800
if I know the locations and everything,

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.440
and I'll have this idea of what I'm going to create, right?

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.760
And then I'm there filming, right?

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.840
And always without fail,

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.560
reality is something altogether different

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.920
than what I thought it would be.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.520
But it's still good to have the original idea.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.600
Yeah, yeah, but if I tried to hold to that original vision,

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.400
and to create a film out of that idea,

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.440
they'd be crap, all the films would be crap.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:46.160
So I have to adapt, I have to evolve my approach,

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:49.880
and then embrace what is actually occurring

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.440
with the people who are actually doing it,

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.040
and then re-envision.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.200
So that re-envision is very active

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.120
during the entire filming process.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.960
And so that's the second creation.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.880
That's the rethinking and re-visualizing

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.720
based on what we're actually experiencing and seeing

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.000
what this film is going to be.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.360
And then I finish filming, right?

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.080
And we bring the hard drives back

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.600
and we plug in the hard drives in the edit bay.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.000
And oftentimes, you know,

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.760
because it's two of us filming most of the time,

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.680
I haven't seen all the footage.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.920
Because in the field, it's all about just filming, right?

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.720
And then just transferring the footage

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.360
and getting it on safely, you know,

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.840
cloned to multiple drives.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:33.600
I don't have a chance to review everything.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:36.400
I can't do rushes like you do on a large feature.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.480
So because I'm filming half of it,

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.800
I know what I filmed, right?

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.200
But I haven't seen everything

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.080
the director of photography has filmed, right?

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:50.080
So the next stage for me is reviewing every single frame

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.000
of what's been filmed.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.120
And that's where discovery happens the third time, right?

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.640
Or second time rather, is wow,

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.680
now I thought we'd filmed this,

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.120
but actually there's this over here.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.480
And then I have to open up this second vision

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.960
and turn and transform it into a third vision for the film

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.960
based on what's actually on the hard drive.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:15.720
So is this like a daily process?

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.960
So what I do, my process is that

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.040
if it's a really difficult project,

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.400
I'll take a break before I go through this,

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.160
just for healing, you know,

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.400
and some space away and fresh eyes.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.120
And usually that's about a month.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:32.480
And then once I re-engage, I re-engage whole hog,

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.160
I re-engage fully and I review every single frame.

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.600
And as I do that, I create a spreadsheet.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.240
And for Hunger War, that spreadsheet was,

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.880
I don't know, 1500 lines long or something,

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:48.120
where it's basically log notes.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:51.320
And I watch every scene and I take notes

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.200
and I know really what we have.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.880
And once I've gone through that process

01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.320
that takes about a month

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.880
and I really know what we came back with,

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.800
I create an outline for the film from that.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.760
And that's the third visioning, right?

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.600
That's usually completely different

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.800
than my original vision for the film to some extent, right?

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.280
But I have to stay open to that entire process

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:17.080
or I'd be trying to create something

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.640
that I can't really create.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:22.680
So I think those are the three creations for me.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.840
That's so cool to know what we have,

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:31.840
just to lay it all out and to load it in into your mind.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.840
Because this is the capture of reality we have.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.840
It's a very kind of scientific process too,

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.520
because in science you collect a bunch of data

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:43.720
about a phenomena and now you have to analyze that data.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.080
But now your phenomena is long gone.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:47.840
Now you just have the data.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:51.480
Just the data and you have to write a paper about it,

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.040
analyze the data, it's similar things.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.480
You have to load it all in,

01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:00.000
where's the story, how do you,

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
that last probably profound piece of doing the editing

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.280
like in your mind, how to lay those things out?

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.240
Well, it's almost like the scientific process, right?

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:15.360
I have a hypothesis, a creative hypothesis, right?

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.040
Not a scientific one.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.120
But then I'm testing the hypothesis

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.000
during the course of filming, right?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.320
And I have to stay true to what the data tells me

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.760
in the end, creatively.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.520
So it's very similar to the scientific processes.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.200
I don't know what we should, we should probably coin that.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.200
Yeah, that's pretty good.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.680
Creative scientific process or something like that.

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:38.280
But then you actually do the edit and then you watch,

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.320
that's also iterative in a sense.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:45.200
Because maybe when you have a film,

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.440
that's 20, 30, 40 minutes, or if it's feature length,

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:54.320
like do you ever have it where it sucks?

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.440
Like it's not at all.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.680
Is there a stage where it sucks?

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.720
Like a stage where, right, right.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.360
Like is where it's like, no, this is not,

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.760
this is not what I was meant.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.600
Like when it's all put together in this way,

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.000
this doesn't, this is not working right.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.760
This is not right.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.080
Or do you, is it always like an incremental step

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:12.920
towards better and better and better?

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.920
It's incremental, yeah, it's incremental.

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.360
Yeah, and there's always some moment in the editing process

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.120
where there's a breakthrough,

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:24.360
where suddenly I understand how it fits together more fully.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.120
And you have to be, like you said, resilient.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.560
You have to be patient that that moment will come.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.400
Yeah, exactly.

01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:31.440
Are you ultra self-critical

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.400
or are you generally optimistic and patient?

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.520
I don't think those are mutually exclusive.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.280
Right, so you just oscillate

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.480
or are they like dance partners or something?

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.160
They're dance partners, yeah.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.440
Definitely dance, you know, all the way through the process.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.400
By way of advice, you know, to young filmmakers

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.720
how to film something that is recognized

01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:00.640
by the world in some way.

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:05.400
I would say, you know, first off, learn your craft, right?

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:10.400
Because I think craft is incredibly foundational, right?

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.480
To creating a powerful story.

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.600
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when you say craft,

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.800
do you mean just the raw technical,

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.800
the director of photography, like the filming aspect?

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.520
Is it the storytelling, is it the access, the whole thing?

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.960
I think craft is more than just knowing

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:28.760
how to push record on a camera or what lens to use, right?

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:30.520
That's part of it, right?

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:35.400
But I think at least in non-fiction, you know,

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.680
I'm a product to some extent

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.400
of having to know how to do it all, right?

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.760
Having to teach myself how to do it all.

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.160
Because I didn't go to film school, you know,

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:53.080
but I became so enamored of telling stories

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:54.640
through a camera.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.040
Where was the leap, by the way, from theater to storyteller?

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.960
Oh, I just needed an extra class in grad school.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.040
I was in a MFA directing class and I needed an extra class

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.000
and I just sort of like talked my way

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.800
into a television directing class and fell in love with it.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.240
And the actor became the director.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.720
Well, yeah, I mean, I wasn't an actor,

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.720
but I had to act and I had to know the craft of acting

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.040
because I was in the theater, you know,

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.800
to work with directors. Did you love it though?

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.080
Did you love acting? The theater?

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.280
Yeah, theater?

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.920
The first, yeah, as an undergraduate, yeah.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:34.080
But then I learned pretty quickly that I was pretty bad at it

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.480
or at least not very good.

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.360
And that my skills lay elsewhere

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.560
in more sort of behind the scenes and shaping a story.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.600
When you started taking a class,

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.800
but also telling stories as a director,

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.800
did you quickly realize that you're pretty good at this

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.120
or was it a grind?

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.720
That's a good question, Lux.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.280
I think I definitely knew right away

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:05.480
that it was more my wheelhouse, right?

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.480
And I think part of that was because I grew up

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.240
in sort of a world of imagination.

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:18.080
And I think that act of imagination as a child

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:21.120
really lent itself well to the skill set

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.000
that a director needs, right?

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.800
To shape story, to shape narrative, to shape performances.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.680
So I think it was a much more natural fit for me.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.880
Was I excellent at the beginning?

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.040
Heck no, no, you know, I think few people are, but I learned.

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:38.000
What was the biggest struggle for you?

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.640
So your imagination clearly was something

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.640
that you worked on for a lifetime.

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:46.520
So I'm sure that was pretty strong.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.960
Books, came from books.

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.360
Books.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.040
But the actual conversion of the imagination,

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.040
you said shape the story.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:56.920
Where was the skill most lacking

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.160
in the shaping of the story initially?

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.000
Technical side.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:00.840
Just technical side.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.920
Yeah, like, you know, cause I taught myself everything.

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.680
What kind of microphone should I use, right?

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:07.600
What kind of camera, what does this lens do?

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.520
I didn't know any of that.

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.640
And so I essentially was, I have been self-taught, technically.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.040
How do you get good technically,

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.240
would you say, when you're self-taught?

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.640
Just doing it over and over again.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.240
And what kind of stories were you telling?

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.760
I began shooting local commercials for...

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.600
For money.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:25.440
For money, yeah, yeah.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.240
So you're doing professional projects.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.600
And so I kind of learned on the job as I did it.

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.480
How many hobby projects did you do, just for the hell of it?

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.200
Or were you trying to focus on the professional?

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.760
Well, I was trying to make money, right?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.400
Right, right out of grad school, just to pay the rent.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.440
And then that, you know, that's a forcing function to...

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.680
I mean, I personally love having my back to the wall

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:48.920
where financially you're screwed if you don't succeed.

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.480
So that's nice.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.960
I mean, I lived out of the trunk of my car

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.720
for a couple of years after grad school,

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.520
just freelancing, you know?

01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:00.320
Just like, but that couple years really helped me learn fast,

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.480
cause I had to learn fast, you know?

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.880
So I did a couple of voyages around the world

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:08.160
for this group called Semester at Sea

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.600
that is a floating university

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.880
that where they go out three and a half months at a time

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:15.080
with about 500 college level students

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:16.520
and about 35 professors.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:19.480
And so you're shooting every day for three and a half months

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:20.800
in like nine different countries.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.280
And so that really was like instrumental to me

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.720
becoming a pretty good camera person pretty quickly.

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.280
And you were doing most of the work yourself?

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.240
One man, one man bed, yeah.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.480
The second voyage, I at least had an editor with me.

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.960
Yeah, but I was shooting everything.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:37.800
Yeah.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:38.840
What's the perfect team?

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:43.680
Is it two people for non-fiction asking for a friend?

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.520
Yeah.

01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:45.880
Some kind of interested in some storytelling,

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:50.040
not of the level and the sophistication that you're doing,

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:51.040
but more.

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:53.040
I think you have to allow the story to dictate

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.280
what the size of the film should be.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.000
For these small human rights docs I do,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.840
I think two or three, you know,

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.560
it means you work your butt off, right?

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.360
Cause you're doing everything, right?

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.640
But it allows you to tell intimate stories

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.560
and have that access.

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:08.520
I'm doing a film this summer that's a scripted piece

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.520
where we'll probably have 25 crew people.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.360
Oh wow.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:12.960
You know, so it's completely different,

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.560
different endeavor altogether.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:18.560
But doing it yourself, what do you think about that?

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:21.320
Even though you have that trillion dollars.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.040
Oh, I have that trillion dollars again?

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.120
Sweet, you can write that check before I leave.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:25.960
I will.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:26.800
Great.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.320
I've never seen a check for that thing.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.160
It's gonna be interesting.

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:32.000
How many zeros is that?

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:32.960
I write them so often.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:37.720
I've lost track or the United States government

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.360
sure as heck writes them often.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.280
Okay, anyway, I mean like, is there an argument

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.520
can you still man the case for a single person?

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.760
You know, not for me, not for me.

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.360
And here's why.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:58.680
What I found is that by being a team of two filming

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:03.680
with a field producer, by two people filming,

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:10.480
it allows us to double our footage first off, right?

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.680
So we have twice as much footage in the time we're filming

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:15.920
to come back with as opposed to one person filming.

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:18.400
So you're each manning a camera.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.880
Yeah, constantly.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.840
And how much, sorry to keep interrupting,

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.240
how much interaction interplay there?

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:28.200
Sometimes the director of photography is in another room

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:29.680
filming a different scene.

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.360
If it makes sense, sometimes we're cross shooting

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.760
in the same room, right?

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:35.440
It just depends on the needs of the moment.

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:38.040
So we come back with double the footage is one thing,

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:40.360
but as a director, so that's, you know,

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:45.200
and given how access is sometimes shaped by the event

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.800
so that we can only something, you know,

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:49.680
in lifeboat, for example, you know,

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.880
a rescue operation may only happen three days, right?

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.000
So you want as much footage of that as you can.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.360
But the other piece of it that's really critical for me

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.400
I found is that by having another human being

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:02.800
I'm filming with, who I'm co-shooting with,

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.120
it frees me up as a director

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:07.640
to not always have to be shooting either.

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:11.680
I can do all the other work to build relationships, right?

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.120
To have side conversations with people,

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:18.760
to sort out the right way to tell a story, right?

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:19.960
Or to transfer footage,

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.040
knowing that the director of photography

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.440
is still filming during all that.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.520
So it frees me up to think of as a director

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:30.040
rather than just an image acquirer.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.360
Yeah, because there's also,

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:32.520
I don't know how distracting it is,

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:33.840
you've obviously done it for years,

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:38.840
but setting stuff up, it preoccupies your mind.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.560
Like pressing the record button

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.040
and like framing stuff and all that,

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.520
that's still, that takes up some part of your mind

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.320
where you can't think freely.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.560
That's my choice, right?

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:51.120
That's how I work best.

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.120
That said, the caveat there would be

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.080
that's not the only way to do it, obviously, right?

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:59.040
Like one of my favorite documentaries of all time

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:02.960
is a documentary called A Woman Captured,

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.040
shot in Hungary, by a single filmmaker

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:09.520
with a single camera, with a single lens, right?

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.200
And it's brilliant and powerful

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:16.120
and moving and interventional.

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:17.960
It's incredible filmmaking,

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.360
and it was a single human being

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.480
who created that film with a collaborator or a subject.

01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:26.840
So it can be done, it's just not how I work best.

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:30.040
Yeah, how much personally would the other person,

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:34.200
how important is the relationship with them

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.040
outside of the filming?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.080
With the director of photography?

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.680
The director of photography, say.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:44.520
Like how much drinking, and if you don't drink,

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:46.120
whatever the equivalent of that is,

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.600
do you have to do together?

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.000
How much soul searching?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.480
Or is it more like two surgeons getting together?

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:55.960
Is it surgeons or is it a jazz band?

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.000
Well, it could be either, right?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.280
Hopefully not at the same time, though,

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:01.040
because I don't think surgeons and jazz bands

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.640
go well together, probably.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:05.800
They're both good with fingers, I suppose.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.280
Exactly, but I'd rather maybe not play jazz

01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.920
while they operate on me.

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.920
But I think, for me, I think there are moments of both,

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.640
but usually not at the same time, right?

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:20.920
There are surgical moments where the moment is so pressing,

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.080
you really have to be that task driven, right?

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:27.160
To capture as thoroughly as possible

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.360
whatever's unfolding, right?

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.440
But I think there's other times

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.960
where you do improvise like jazz, right?

01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.000
And where you have a lot of choices ahead of you

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.880
and you're doing maybe a dance

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.120
with the other camera person, right?

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.280
In order to capture a scene as creatively

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:47.520
and fully as possible during a fixed duration.

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.440
How much, you said shaping,

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.400
because it is non-fiction,

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.480
but I feel like there's so many ways

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:57.920
to tell the same non-fiction that is bordering on fiction.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.760
Yeah.

01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:01.200
Well, it's storytelling.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:08.120
And how much shaping do you see yourself as doing?

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.720
Like how important is your role, how you tell the story?

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.520
I suppose the question I'm asking is

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.720
how many ways can you really screw this up?

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.960
Every day you can screw it up.

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:25.040
I mean, that's really the,

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:26.040
I think what you're asking about

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:29.600
is really the ethos of documentary filmmaking, right?

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.640
I allow a lot of things to guide my choices.

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:38.160
One of them being, am I being fair, right?

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.800
Not balanced, right?

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:43.520
But am I being fair to what I'm witnessing?

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:46.480
Does the camera capturing in a fair way

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:49.560
the truth of the reality, some fundamental truth to it?

01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:51.640
And it also speaks to consent, right?

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:53.960
Am I being fair in a sense of,

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.440
do I have active consent in this moment, right?

01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.600
Regardless of whether I have a signed piece of paper.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.320
I always find some way to document it,

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.400
whether it's just direct address to camera

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:05.440
or a translated release.

01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:07.720
So there's, actually that's an interesting little,

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.760
so they say sometimes to the camera

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.080
that they consent or they sign the thing.

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.080
Yeah, so for example,

01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.320
the large broadcast companies have this formalized process

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.080
where they present a piece of paper, right?

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:21.920
Yes.

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:25.200
And the subject reads it and they sign it

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.880
and then you have permission and that's irrevocable, right?

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.800
So it'll hold up in court.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.840
That's not how I operate, right?

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.600
And so it's just, for example,

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.720
that doesn't work if someone's illiterate

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.040
and can't read that piece of paper, right?

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.320
What if they don't know how to sign their name, right?

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.480
So instead you have to have a conversation,

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:49.440
ask questions, have them ask questions,

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:51.600
come to a complete understanding

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.720
before you even know whether they understand

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.000
what you're asking, right?

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.280
And then in that case, if someone's illiterate,

01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:59.560
then you have that conversation, you just sit down.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.840
It takes a long time sometimes, but you have to do it.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.440
And then if they still wanna participate

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.600
and they give you their consent,

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.640
they can't sign a piece of paper, right?

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.840
So then you just do in their native language, right?

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:14.440
And then you have direct consent to camera

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:15.280
in their language.

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.120
Interesting.

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:17.960
But also you're speaking to the consent

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:21.040
that's just a human placing trust in you.

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:21.880
Yeah?

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:22.720
You make a connection like this.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.560
That's the most important concern.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.400
Right.

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:29.400
I hate papers, I hate papers and lawyers.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.760
Because they, exactly for that reason,

01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.520
yeah, okay, great, but you should be focusing

01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:40.160
on the human connection that leads to the trust,

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.760
consent day-to-day, minute-to-minute,

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:43.800
because that can change.

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:46.000
Absolutely, and it does change.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:49.400
You mentioned a woman captured.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:52.680
What the, this is, I'm sure you can't answer that,

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.120
but I will force you.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:58.360
What are the top three documentaries of all time,

01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:01.240
short or feature length, to you?

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.240
This is not your opinion, this is objective truth.

01:38:05.820 --> 01:38:09.320
Maybe top one, what's the greatest?

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:14.360
We got, let's see, March of the Penguins,

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.880
that's probably number one for me.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.720
Really?

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.760
No, I'm just kidding, I don't know.

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.760
I do seem to, the metaphor of penguins

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.200
huddling together in hard, cold,

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:32.520
like in the harsh conditions of nature,

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.960
that's something that's kind of beautiful.

01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.200
I don't love all nature documentaries,

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.440
but like something about March of the Penguins,

01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:42.600
I think Morgan Freeman.

01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:43.520
Yeah, he narrated it.

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.200
Narrates it, so maybe everything,

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.880
just any documentary with Morgan Freeman,

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.200
I'm a sucker for that.

01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.240
Warner Herzog, Life and the Taiga, The Simple People.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:55.520
I love Grizzly Man.

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.360
Grizzly Man.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.080
I love Grizzly Man, I think that's one of his best works.

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:03.240
Yes, I think that's Joe Rogan's favorite documentary.

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.920
It's both comedy and, I mean, it's-

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.960
Tragic comedy, yeah.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.800
Is there something that stands out to you?

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.960
I mean, I'm joking about like best,

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.800
something that was impactful to you.

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.800
Just to put it out there, I don't think there's any way

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:22.000
to say that they're objectively the best three

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:22.840
documentaries of all time.

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.800
But for me, and you may find this interesting,

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.800
given your background, is that I think my top three

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:35.720
are all from the Eastern Bloc, actually.

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:39.680
So Aquarella by Kosciakowski,

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.000
Victor Kosciakowski is one of my favorite,

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.800
and it's a couple years old now,

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:47.440
which is sort of a meditation on the place water has

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.120
on our planet and on our lives.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.360
I think A Woman Captured that I mentioned,

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.560
which was shot in Hungary.

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.520
Is it a feature length one?

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.520
Both are feature lengths, yeah.

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:01.680
It is just brilliant, and it, I think,

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.360
has yet to find distribution here in the US, you know?

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:09.560
But it's a perfect example of what they call verite,

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:13.400
or direct non-fiction filmmaking.

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:15.640
A European woman, this is the synopsis,

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.640
a European woman has been kept by a family

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:20.160
as a domestic slave for 10 years,

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:23.560
drawing courage from the filmmaker's presence.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.280
She decides to escape the unbearable oppression

01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.600
and become a free person.

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.560
Wow, so the filmmaker is part of the story.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.760
Part of the story, it didn't start that way,

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.360
but during the course of the story,

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:39.520
the filmmaker comes to understand

01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:41.920
that this is actually modern-day slavery.

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:45.360
And rather than just allow it to be,

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:48.440
actually enables and assists this woman

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.000
to free herself from slavery and become a free woman.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.680
I wonder, sorry, on a small tangent

01:40:52.680 --> 01:40:53.680
before we get to number three,

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.720
like Icarus is interesting, too.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.960
How often do you become part of the story,

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.720
or the story is different because of your presence?

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.120
Like, you changed the tide of history.

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.720
Yeah, well, back to just like one person at a time

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.120
that we keep talking, you know,

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:16.960
we keep coming back to that theme on some level.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.120
So this could tie in interestingly

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.160
into one of my favorite films, actually.

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.760
So the last two films that I would mention

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.640
from my top four list would be,

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.280
the third Eastern Bloc one would be a film called Immortal

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:34.520
in 2019, which was shot in Russia by a Russian woman

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.840
that sort of, you know, examines the place of the state

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:44.840
in shaping individuals to be vehicles for the state.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.240
I mean, that's my own synopsis,

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.080
but that's one of my takeaways

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:52.160
from the brilliant 60-minute doc or so.

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.320
Again, Russian filmmaking, right?

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:58.040
It's really quite good and powerful.

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:00.760
The fourth one would be a Frederick Wiseman film,

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:05.760
Titicut Follies, which was filmed in the U.S. decades ago

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:10.040
inside basically the bowels of an insane asylum

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.080
or a mental health institution.

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.440
And I bring up Wiseman because, you know,

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:18.960
he is really the godfather, so to speak,

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.760
of direct cinema or cinema verite.

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:26.080
And I went early in my career,

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.400
I really believed in what he expressed

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:33.600
as the place of the verite filmmaker,

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.040
which is simply fly on the wall,

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:41.760
which is only observational in nature, right?

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:44.920
And I believe that that's how I should be

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.280
as a nonfiction filmmaker,

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.400
that I was there only to bear witness, to observe,

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.960
and not to intervene in any way, shape, or form.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.000
And that was the sort of foundation

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.040
for how I operated for many, many years.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.880
And then some things happened.

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:06.880
So one of those things that happened was I filmed Lifeboat.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:11.000
And during the course of filming Lifeboat,

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.440
which, you know, covered rescue operations

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:16.640
in the Mediterranean off the coast of Libya,

01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:21.720
in the first three days of that rescue mission,

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:28.120
you know, we came upon over 3,000 people, asylum seekers,

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:30.760
floating in flimsy rafts in the water.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:36.320
And we were on the Zodiacs, and we were filming.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.120
And within the first couple hours, you know,

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:45.120
we would come up to these rafts and these boats

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:47.520
that were in really dire shape,

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:51.080
and people would be pushed off, and people would jump off,

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:53.360
and people would fall into the water.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.600
And some of them couldn't swim.

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.360
And so we found ourselves in this moment

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.160
where we had a choice.

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.400
We could film someone drown in front of us,

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:08.080
or we could put our cameras down

01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.880
and pull them out of the water.

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:11.600
And so that's what we did.

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.840
We put our cameras in the bottom of the Zodiac

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:17.400
and just started pulling people out of the water.

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.720
And, you know, if I was Wiseman, right,

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:26.040
according to his paradigm, then we should have just filmed.

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.600
And I didn't anticipate that moment beforehand.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.440
I had no sort of foreknowledge

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:35.840
that I was gonna find myself faced with that dilemma

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.360
of the moment as a documentarian.

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.040
But there was no question in my mind

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.400
that I had to put my camera down

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:43.880
and pull that fellow human being out of the water.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.520
And I don't regret it at all.

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.920
So I've come to a different place.

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.160
I've evolved to what I believe

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:52.360
for the kind of film that I do is more appropriate, right?

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.000
Like I can go to sleep at night

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.760
knowing that regardless of how the film

01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.760
would have been different if I hadn't made that choice,

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.800
I made the right choice as a human being.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.400
So I think of it as being a human being first

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.320
and a filmmaker second in moments like that.

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:09.960
That's beautifully, beautifully put.

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.320
But I also think like you could be a human being

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.400
in small ways too, like silly ways,

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:20.960
and put a little bit of yourself in documentaries.

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.080
I tend to see that as really beautiful.

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:25.800
Like the meta piece of it?

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.040
Yeah, just put yourself into the movie a little bit.

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.600
Because break that third, fourth, whatever the wall is,

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:38.840
is realize that there's a human behind the camera too.

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:41.720
For some reason, me as a fan, as a viewer,

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.960
that's enjoyable too.

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.840
I think there's a real authenticity there

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:49.240
behind the, especially with these hard stories

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:53.080
that you're doing that there's a human being struggling too.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:56.440
Like observing the suffering

01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:02.480
and having to bear the burden

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:05.200
that this kind of suffering exists in the world

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:09.120
and you're behind that camera, living that struggle.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.480
And there's small ways to show yourself in that way.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:16.560
As you know, I don't do that in a big way.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:19.000
But I actually, there are subtle moments

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.240
where I allow that presence to live just for a second.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.880
Like I hate belly button docs.

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:26.720
That's what I call them.

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:27.560
I don't know.

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.400
What's a belly button doc?

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.440
A belly button doc is navel gazing, right?

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:33.920
Where sort of a narcissistic filmmaking

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.400
where someone just studies their own place in the world,

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:39.240
right?

01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.080
I see, yeah.

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.160
I think my, you know,

01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.680
I'm more concerned with how I can intervene, right?

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:49.840
Yeah.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:52.600
Well, you're trying to really deeply empathize.

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:53.440
Yeah.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:55.960
So like, if you deeply empathize, who am I?

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:58.000
I don't wanna center myself in these stories.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.400
It's not about me, right?

01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:01.120
I am so unimportant.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.680
What is important is what's happening,

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:06.280
what's unfolding in the world that we need to act upon.

01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:09.160
And I think it's selfish and narcissistic

01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:13.440
to push myself into these stories unnecessarily.

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.280
Now that said, I think there is some small value

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:18.960
in what you're saying just to remind viewers

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:21.080
that there's obviously a filmmaker at play.

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:23.080
So sometimes the way that I do that

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:25.760
is just like through a question on camera.

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.720
I'd allow the audio to live of a question

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.240
or during a conversation I'm having with someone

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.880
so they can just hear how it's posed, for example, right?

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.120
And to me, that's enough.

01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.080
Yeah.

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:43.200
I do like moments when people recognize that you exist.

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:47.280
They look at the filmmaker past the camera

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:49.680
and yes, you ask the question in an interview

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:52.640
or something like that, and they respond to that.

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:54.120
Yeah.

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:58.320
They respond to this new perturbation into their reality

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.040
that was created by this other human.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:00.880
Yeah.

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:02.880
And I especially like when those questions

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.680
or those perturbations are a little bit absurd

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:11.200
and add something very novel to their situation

01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.280
and that novelty reveals something about them.

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:17.120
So as opposed to capturing

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.000
the day-to-day reality of their life,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.080
you do that plus the perturbations of something novel.

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.400
Yeah.

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:26.920
But of course, there's all kinds of ways to do this.

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.960
Let me, what was number five, by the way?

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.040
I only gave you four.

01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:31.880
You just-

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.520
I'm just gonna stay at four.

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:35.160
There's a short doc I like, I can mention.

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:38.520
It's called The Toxic Pigs of Fukushima.

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:39.480
I know, I know.

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:40.320
I apologize.

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.160
I know, I know.

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.240
It's dark.

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.080
It's a great title though, right?

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:43.920
It's a great title.

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:45.280
Yeah, great title.

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.760
No one's seen it, but it's great.

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.400
It says what it sounds like.

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:50.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:51.400
It's exactly what it sounds like,

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.760
but really brilliantly executed.

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:56.400
Well, let me ask you about Lifeboat

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.320
because it's extremely,

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:01.360
I don't,

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.360
it's a really moving idea.

01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.520
Just the fact that this exists in the world,

01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:14.520
that there's, as a metaphor, as a reality,

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:18.680
that there is a set of people trying to flee desperately.

01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:20.200
It's the desperation of it.

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.000
And now with these refugees, the desperation of that,

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
of trying to escape towards a world that's full of mystery,

01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:34.240
uncertainty, doubts, could be hopeless at times.

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.000
And you're willing to do a lot for your own survival

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.720
and for the survival of your family

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:40.720
and all those kinds of things.

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.840
That's kind of the human spirit.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.400
And you just capture it in Lifeboat.

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:51.040
Can you tell me the story behind this film

01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.520
as you started to already tell?

01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:55.480
Can you tell me what is it about?

01:49:56.480 --> 01:50:01.480
So Lifeboat really seeks to sort of lift up

01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:08.480
and showcase the asylum seeker crisis in the Mediterranean

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:15.040
when it was at its height in 2016.

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:19.000
And it came to be for many reasons,

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.760
but one of those reasons is colleagues

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:26.600
in the NGO community really shared with me

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.760
that when the borders between Greece and Turkey

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:34.760
were shut down, that the flow of Syrian asylum seekers

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.720
that was initially going across from Turkey to Greece

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.600
was going to shift westward across the Mediterranean.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.920
So I started to research that

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:46.720
and discovered that was exactly the case.

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:49.520
And then further stumbled upon the fact

01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:54.440
that nation states hadn't really stepped up to address it.

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:57.520
And that there were hundreds of asylum seekers

01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.480
often drowning in these flimsy crafts

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:01.880
that were pushed off from the shores of Libya

01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:06.160
because the EU wasn't doing its duty

01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:09.640
to patrol those waters from a humanitarian standpoint.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:11.960
And so the net result of that was that

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:16.520
this whole sort of like humanitarian community sprung up

01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:18.920
and it was civil society based

01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:22.240
that tried to meet the needs of those asylum seekers

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:25.640
to just ensure that fellow human beings

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:27.520
weren't drowning, simply put.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:31.120
And one of those was the small little NGO called Sea Watch,

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.440
which when they discovered what was happening

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:38.440
just cobbled together a coalition of volunteers,

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.880
bought a research vessel, retrofitted it

01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:44.520
and motored down off the coast of Libya

01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:46.080
to start pulling people out of the water.

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.840
And again, I found that inspiring.

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.560
That this group of volunteers was doing something

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:56.960
that our leaders wouldn't, right?

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:59.600
And it was something as basic and simple

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.600
as saving human beings.

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:06.320
And I thought there was an inspiring story there.

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.480
And as it turned out, there was.

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:11.240
Have you ever saved someone's life

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:17.560
as part of making these documentaries directly?

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:22.120
And directly, I think you probably have countless lives,

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:25.040
but directly, were you put in that position?

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.880
I don't wanna.

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.840
I mean, I certainly poured people out of the water

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:30.760
who couldn't swim.

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:33.560
I did that.

01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:35.720
And that's, again, speaking to the basic humanity.

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:37.640
Put down the camera and help.

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:39.720
Yeah.

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.560
So this is people coming from Libya

01:52:43.560 --> 01:52:46.280
trying to make it across the Mediterranean Sea

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.960
on a crappy tiny boat.

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:51.440
From a filmmaker's perspective, how do you film that?

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:55.960
Was there decisions to capture the desperation?

01:52:55.960 --> 01:53:00.960
Well, we were going back to this idea of access

01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:03.560
and how that's so fundamental to my approach.

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:10.080
We were bound by the strictures of the rescue operation

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.960
on this sea watch vessel, which was 30 meters long.

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:16.080
And we were two of a crew of 15.

01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.720
So we had to multitask all the time

01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:21.720
because the only reason we were on that boat

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:25.440
was by agreeing that if needed,

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:30.600
we would do whatever necessary to help.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:33.160
And so it was very active on multiple levels.

01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:38.040
And we were making decisions each and every day

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:42.200
that were not only filmmaking and creative decisions,

01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:47.200
but also decisions about how to live that duality

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.960
of being a humanitarian and a filmmaker simultaneously.

01:53:56.960 --> 01:54:01.240
And the greatest example I can share of that

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.480
was with my director of photography in that project,

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:05.400
Kenny Allen.

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.920
Kenny's a big guy.

01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:12.000
He's got arms like tree trunks.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And because he was so physically able and strong,

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:22.760
the head of mission really tasked him

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.880
to be on the zodiacs, to pull people out of the water

01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:27.160
because he could literally with one arm reach down

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.480
and just oftentimes pull someone out, right?

01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:32.960
Whereas usually it would take two or three people, right?

01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:37.080
And so when we were at the height of triage

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.440
and there were people in the water all over

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.840
and rafts were sinking,

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.800
Kenny was out pulling people out of the water.

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:46.440
And this went on for like 24 hours, right?

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:48.400
And at the end of that first day,

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.280
I remember like looking over on the deck

01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:54.400
and seeing Kenny like help people up from the ladders

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:56.320
to walk them back, right?

01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:59.840
And his camera was nowhere to be seen, right?

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.320
And so I walked over to him

01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:03.800
and I just grabbed him by the shoulders and said,

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:06.040
Kenny, where's your camera?

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.800
And he didn't know.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.120
He had no idea where his camera was, right?

01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.200
And so I just said, Kenny,

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:17.440
we're here to do what you're doing,

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:21.960
but we're also here to film it, right?

01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:24.240
To make sure that we document

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.120
what is unfolding in front of us

01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.160
so that we have a record of it, right?

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:30.720
So we can bring it to a larger audience.

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:32.400
So you need to go find your camera

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.880
so we can also document it.

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.480
And that kind of pulled him out

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:38.400
and he went and got his camera and started filming again.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.920
But that gives you a sense of sort of this world

01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:43.920
that we had to live in in order to get the story done.

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:47.280
But I think to be a great director of photography,

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.920
to be a great director,

01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:53.840
you have to lose yourself like that in the story too.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.880
But usually with a camera in your hand, right?

01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:58.080
But sometimes you forget the camera.

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.080
I mean, I feel like if you're obsessed

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.200
with the camera too much,

01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:08.040
you can lose the humanity of it.

01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.280
You get obsessed with the film and the story.

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:11.480
It can become clinical.

01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.320
Yes, it can become clinical.

01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:13.160
Yeah, absolutely.

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:15.640
And it's, yeah, absolutely.

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:19.360
And I don't wanna become clinical in my film, certainly.

01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:23.440
Let me ask you a strange and perhaps edgy question.

01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.120
So some filmmakers believe it's justified

01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:30.800
to break the rules in order to tell a powerful story.

01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:35.800
Warner Herzog, I read this somewhere,

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:37.880
teaches young filmmakers to pick locks

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.560
and forge documents and so on.

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:40.400
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:41.400
Interesting.

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:42.520
What do you think about that?

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:45.080
Bending the rules in service of telling a story?

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.240
You would, of course, never break the law.

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:54.440
But is there, does that just generally speaking

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.680
bending the rules and so on?

01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.280
You know, just to elaborate on this question, perhaps,

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.960
I'm distinctly aware that there's parts in the world

01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:08.960
where the rule of law is not, like,

01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:14.360
enforced as cleanly as it is in the United States,

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:16.520
as fairly as it is in the United States,

01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:20.040
that there's a lot of bribery.

01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:22.920
There's a lot of, like, you don't really know

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:27.560
to trust, you don't know if you can trust the cops

01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:30.280
or basically anybody.

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.520
So, like, the rules are a very hazy kind of concept.

01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.480
And a lot of them, especially, like, it's funny,

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.200
but authoritarian regimes often have a giant bureaucracy

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:40.800
build up that's full of rules.

01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.960
There's more rules than you know what to deal with

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:45.920
and you can't actually live life unless you break the rules.

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:49.160
Anyway, laying that all out on the table,

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:51.680
do you ever contend with that?

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000
On what are the rules I can break or should break

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:00.840
to keep to the spirit of the story?

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.280
I think you have to ask yourself, are the rules just

01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.080
and why are they in place, right?

01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.360
So, for example, coming into the airport

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:10.040
in southern Yemen, right?

01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:11.880
If I just tried to walk through the airport

01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:14.120
with all my equipment, even with all the permissions

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.000
beforehand, like we had, without having a fixer

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.520
at the airport beforehand to make sure

01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:23.200
we didn't go through the standard line, right?

01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:28.280
We would have been caught up for three hours at least

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:30.920
negotiating over our equipment and eventually paying

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:33.480
a bribe to get it through, right?

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:36.640
That's just reality in a place like Yemen.

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:40.800
And so, of course, knowing that, having talked to colleagues

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.360
who had taken that path previously,

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.160
I took a different path, right?

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:50.040
Well, we hire a fixer beforehand to sort it out beforehand,

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:52.280
rather than spending three hours of our time

01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:54.200
and paying a series of bribes.

01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:57.040
Instead, we're going to get it fixed beforehand

01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:59.240
so that we can walk through a different line

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:02.200
and have no one look at any of our equipment.

01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:06.440
That's a pretty good trade-off in my mind.

01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:09.320
What about security when you're traveling in these places?

01:59:09.320 --> 01:59:10.840
Do you ever have bodyguards?

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:14.640
Well, several questions around that.

01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.840
Are you ever afraid for your life

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.720
when you're filming in a war zone?

01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:24.600
Is there any way to lessen the probability of death?

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:28.400
I don't have a death wish.

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.000
I try to mitigate risk however I can, however I can.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.080
But one of the ways I can't do it in a conflict zone

01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:37.440
is by having armed security with me.

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:39.280
And the reason for that is because,

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:41.720
especially in a place like Yemen, right?

01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:44.280
If you have armed security, you become a target

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:47.960
in a way that if you're operating under sort of

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.080
the auspices of international humanitarian law,

01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:53.640
I actually have more protection.

01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:55.480
So I don't bring security.

01:59:55.480 --> 01:59:58.800
If you're working in Northern Yemen, for example,

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:02.080
you're going to have someone

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:04.840
from the de facto authorities with you anyway

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:06.800
the entire time you're there.

02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:11.000
So the authorities are with you in form anyway.

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:13.640
Regarding fear,

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:18.520
um, yeah, of course.

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.920
I mean, fear is a natural human emotion, right?

02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:25.920
And I think we have a weird mindset,

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:31.160
this sort of heroic mindset surrounding fear in the US,

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:34.280
which I don't pay tribute to.

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:38.960
I believe as a natural human emotion,

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:41.800
it's an alarm bell that I need to pay attention to, right?

02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:46.800
And I think rather than pretending to be brave, right?

02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:49.960
I think you have to just acknowledge

02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:54.960
that fear has a place to keep you alive.

02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:00.200
And I think it's a matter of not letting the fear

02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:01.960
arrest you, right?

02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:05.640
And allowing the fear to live and then acting anyway.

02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:08.440
Don't you think as a documentary filmmaker,

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:10.560
the fear is a really good signal

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:12.880
for potentially a good thing to do

02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:15.000
because there's a story there?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.400
So is fear an indicator that you shouldn't do it

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:19.320
or is it an indicator that you should do it?

02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:23.040
It's probably an indication you should do it, right?

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:26.760
And strangely, I think that's why,

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.600
if there's something unusual about the work I do

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:35.240
in some part, it's because of these types of stories, right?

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:36.800
They're hard to access,

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:41.800
but you also have to have a threshold of willingness

02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:45.480
to do them when you can't,

02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.200
there is no guarantee of physical safety, right?

02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.920
And maybe that's why you should do them.

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:56.280
I'm very much motivated by the things that scare me.

02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.320
They seem to direct the things that are worth doing

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.000
in this all too short life.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.120
How often do you interact with our friendly friends

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:07.680
at the police departments of various locations?

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.920
Because of the humanitarian nature of your work,

02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:17.040
are you able to avoid all such friendly conversations

02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:21.680
or are you often into making friends with her?

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:25.280
I try to avoid the friendly police people

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.280
all over the world as much as possible,

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:33.280
but in some instances, it's important to be proactive,

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.360
and make sure that they know what you're doing

02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:37.520
before you do it.

02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:40.640
So it's all about the context and the situation.

02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:43.560
For example, working in Northern Yemen,

02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:45.560
you couldn't film for five minutes

02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:47.200
if you didn't have paperwork,

02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.640
because you'd be taken away.

02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:50.720
So you have to make sure you have all those permissions

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:51.560
ahead of time.

02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:55.080
50 Feet from Syria.

02:02:57.720 --> 02:03:00.560
I would love to talk at least a little bit about this film.

02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:03.560
First, can you, high level,

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:05.480
can you tell what this documentary's about?

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:09.440
Yeah, it was early in the Syrian uprising,

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:14.440
and we returned to the Syrian-Turkish border

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:18.840
with a Syrian-American orthopedic surgeon

02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:21.520
who was volunteering, operating on refugees

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:24.520
as they flowed across the border from Syria into Turkey.

02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:27.720
And it was an attempt at the time,

02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:30.680
before a lot of films had come out about the conflict,

02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:34.520
to really show, again,

02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:38.760
the effects of the war on civilians.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.960
You've heard me echo that sentiment multiple times now,

02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:46.960
but people knew there was a major conflict in Syria,

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:50.160
but didn't really understand the form that that was taking

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.880
and the impact it was having.

02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:55.520
And so we embedded into the,

02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:58.800
at the time, it was the only clinic in Turkey

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.200
that was sanctioned by the Turkish government

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:05.040
to treat Syrian refugees.

02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:08.360
And so we filmed there with surgeons

02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.200
as they operated on war victims.

02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:14.200
And we also went into Syria, into some of the camps as well.

02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:17.920
So in this film, there's a man who crosses the border

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:19.680
every day to retrieve the wounded

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:21.680
and fear them safety and care.

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:25.440
And you also mentioned about heroism in the United States.

02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:30.000
Can you tell me about this man and just people like him?

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:31.800
Like, what's the heroic action

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:35.840
in some of these places that you've visited?

02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.600
So in that instance, you know,

02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:41.160
I thought of him as the Turkish shindler, right?

02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:44.040
Because he was a human being who,

02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:48.880
of his own volition, no one was paying him to do this,

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:53.640
but he was spending much of his time.

02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:55.480
He was just a local businessman

02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.800
who really saw the need in the camps

02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.360
right across the border, 10K away.

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:04.200
And he saw the medical need in particular

02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:07.440
and how hard it was to get people

02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:11.240
in desperate medical conditions across the border

02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:13.800
where there was a clinic just right across the border.

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:18.000
But because of the security and the layers of security,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.080
they couldn't get out by themselves.

02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:24.120
So he took it upon himself as a Turkish person

02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:27.000
to build relationships with the Turkish guards,

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
which was relatively easy.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.400
And then he built relationships

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.520
with sort of the guards in the no man's land

02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:36.280
between the Syrian guards

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:38.520
and sort of those who lived in the middle area.

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:41.320
And then also with the Syrian guards at the camp.

02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:45.000
And he would drive out there daily and bring them food,

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.080
right?

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:47.680
Talk them up and build relationships.

02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:49.960
So every day he would bring these guards food

02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:51.560
and build relationships with them.

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:54.440
And what that meant was eventually, right?

02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:58.920
He had this avenue of access to and from the camps.

02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:00.400
And so he started using it.

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:05.160
And he would drive this avenue of access

02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:08.080
through the three layers of guards each day.

02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:10.480
And then they would open the gates for him

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:13.960
because he had made himself trustworthy in their eyes.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.520
And he would receive the most desperate medical cases

02:06:18.520 --> 02:06:21.960
that were coming from all over Northern Syria, right?

02:06:21.960 --> 02:06:23.600
To receive medical treatment.

02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:25.480
And he would, as you see in the film,

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:29.080
he would ferry them into the back of his car, right?

02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:31.760
And then drive them to the hospital

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:33.600
where they would receive operations.

02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:36.680
And then he would bring them back if they wanted

02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:39.560
after they'd healed and recovered back to Syria,

02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.960
if they wanted to return post-recovery.

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:44.120
And he didn't get paid for that.

02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:46.640
He was spending his own money to do it

02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:49.600
because he saw other human beings in need.

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:52.880
And it's like we were talking about earlier.

02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:54.640
That's heroic, right?

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:56.000
That's selfless.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:00.000
That's aspirational for me, right?

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Here's someone who is spending their time on the planet

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.800
doing something of value and good to other human beings.

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:09.440
I mean, if you draw parallels to Schindler,

02:07:09.480 --> 02:07:13.680
I feel like the fascinating thing about Schindler

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:18.280
is that he's kind of a flawed human

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:21.680
and is not the kind of human that does these things usually.

02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:23.520
But you just can't help it.

02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.080
And that's like the basic humanity,

02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:30.080
despite who you are, the basic humanity shines through.

02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:34.960
I think the whims of war test people in those ways, right?

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:39.600
They ask of you things that you may not even know

02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.200
were going to be asked of you.

02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:43.160
And then it speaks to who you are

02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.960
fundamentally as a human being.

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:48.840
They reveal who you are as a human being, just as you said.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.160
Let me ask a kind of stupid technical question

02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:58.160
about publications of movies and so on.

02:07:58.160 --> 02:08:01.440
I've been recently becoming good friends

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.160
with Thomas Tall, who was the producer.

02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:05.280
His company, Legendary,

02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:08.560
funded some of the big sort of blockbuster films and so on.

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.960
And so obviously money is part of filmmaking,

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.880
it's interesting, but also the release of movies.

02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:18.880
And me as a consumer with Netflix, with YouTube,

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:23.760
that's one of the reasons I'm a huge fan of YouTube

02:08:23.760 --> 02:08:26.880
is it's like out in the open.

02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:30.400
Access, especially historical access,

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.960
like over time you can look back years later

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:35.200
if you pay some money,

02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:38.400
you can watch some of the great films ever made.

02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:40.360
YouTube, Hulu, Netflix,

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.960
I don't know what other services there are.

02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:44.160
HBO, Paramount.

02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:45.000
Paramount Plus.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.080
Paramount Plus.

02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.200
Anyway, there's all these platforms.

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:52.840
Spotify now.

02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:59.080
I understand they want to create paywalls and so on.

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:02.600
It makes sense, but I'm a huge fan of openness

02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:04.680
and I'm really kind of torn by this whole thing.

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:07.360
Anyway, that's a discussion for perhaps another time.

02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.000
But the short question is,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.040
why is it so hard to watch your documentaries

02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:18.960
and other films, other incredible films on the internet?

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:23.160
If I want to pay unlimited amount of money,

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.440
I want to pay a lot of money to watch it.

02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:27.960
Why is it so hard?

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:30.840
Well, Lifeboat is streaming free on the New Yorker.

02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:35.320
Yes, I saw that, which is interesting.

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.280
That doesn't make any sense.

02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:41.600
And then also Hunger Ward is on Paramount Plus,

02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:42.440
but also-

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:43.280
Pluto TV.

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:45.600
It's also streaming free.

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.880
So you can either go through a paywall

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:52.120
or you can watch it with ads with Big Macs interspersed.

02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:53.000
Big Macs.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:53.840
Sometimes.

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:55.640
Yeah, the contrast.

02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.920
It's tough.

02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:00.320
Well, it really reveals the power of the documentary.

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.920
No, but it's still not.

02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.480
Even those platforms are,

02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:07.840
I mean, they're not as easily accessible.

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:10.600
Because you have to use, you have to think.

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:13.360
And you have to chase a particular-

02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:14.200
You have to chase it.

02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:15.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.080
I guess from an economic standpoint,

02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:19.480
the answer to that is pretty clear, right?

02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:21.720
It may not be what people want to watch.

02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.600
Maybe people want to watch reality.

02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.600
Maybe people want to watch animal rescue shows.

02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:32.320
Here in the US.

02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:36.280
Which is exactly why, in part,

02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:40.680
I think it's so vital that we continue to do stories

02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:44.320
on things that aren't about flowers and puppy dogs, right?

02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:45.320
I would push back on that.

02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:49.280
So there's TikTok.

02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:52.000
And you could say, well, look,

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.920
humans just want to watch really short content

02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:58.320
because they seem to be addicted to that kind of thing.

02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:00.120
That's partially true.

02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:04.240
But they also watch two, three, four, five-hour podcasts.

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:07.400
On TikTok?

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.720
No, there's different platforms for that.

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:11.080
It's a place called YouTube.

02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:12.080
I'll teach you about it some time.

02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:14.360
Okay, yeah, I've never heard of it.

02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:17.000
It's a good place to publish documentaries, I think.

02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:21.880
Humans are interested in a lot of things.

02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:25.920
And I've seen many times a thing that you think

02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:29.080
is a niche thing become a very big thing.

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:31.000
But for them to become mainstream,

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.320
they have to have a platform

02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:35.120
that allows for the mainstream to happen.

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:35.960
The access.

02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:40.000
The access, the dumb, simple, frictionless access.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.600
The frictionless access is a really important thing.

02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:46.880
Paywalls create friction.

02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:50.480
And not just because of the money, it can be free,

02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:52.160
but if you have to click on a thing

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:55.640
or maybe sign up or put your email,

02:11:56.120 --> 02:11:59.480
it's just not, it creates a,

02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:05.040
it prevents you to enjoy the thing you would really enjoy

02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:06.720
and you know you would enjoy,

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:10.840
but your baser human nature prevents you from enjoying

02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:14.280
because you can just open up TikTok and keep scrolling.

02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:17.040
So that's just something to say about platforms

02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:21.680
because I think the things that need platforms the most

02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.000
are things like your films.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.320
The things that I think a lot of people would love watching.

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:30.520
They're very important and they can have viral impact

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:32.920
on the world that is fundamentally positive.

02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:35.480
You know, it's just, it makes me sad

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:40.480
that there's not a machine for celebrating those films.

02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:44.200
There are lots of machines to celebrate them,

02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:47.560
but they're just not as always accessible as YouTube, right?

02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.120
I mean, as soon as you write me that check

02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:51.400
for a trillion dollars when I walk out of here,

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.360
then I'm gonna put all my films on YouTube

02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:55.400
because then I won't have to worry about, you know,

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:58.040
selling them in order so I can make the next film

02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:00.920
because you know, film is not just an art,

02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:02.960
it's also an industry, right?

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:06.560
And that tension between the two is a constant interplay

02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.760
that is a reality for me.

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:10.520
So I always have to think about

02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:14.840
how can I access the largest audience,

02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:19.360
but also, right, go out and shoot the next film, right?

02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:22.360
So that longevity question is also an issue

02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:26.840
and the finances are part of that sort of equation

02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.560
that I constantly have to rewrite over and over again.

02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:32.320
How often, as a creative mind,

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:35.600
do you feel the constraints, the financial constraints?

02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:41.160
I wish I could do a lot more films

02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:44.840
that I can't always because of financial constraints.

02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.200
So it's the number of films.

02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.040
Yeah.

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.560
And are you, is a film that you do currently,

02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.920
is a film that you do at any one time

02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:56.480
as you're filming it already funded

02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:59.040
or is it the funding from previous stuff

02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.120
that you're trying to use?

02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:02.800
Before Hunger Ward,

02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:08.200
I would just take a flyer on my films, right?

02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:12.920
Where I would just say this meets the so-what threshold.

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:15.000
This is a story that has to be told

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.560
and I want to tell it.

02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:19.600
And then I could just go shoot it.

02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:22.800
And usually on credit, usually on a credit card, right?

02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:26.040
So based on a belief that,

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:27.480
Lifeboat was done that way.

02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:28.320
Yes.

02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:29.160
Right?

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:30.000
50 Feet From Syria was done that way.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.200
So you're on a boat, broke.

02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:34.880
Yeah, yeah, but it's free food, right?

02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:37.320
And free lodging because there's a bonk on the boat.

02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:41.600
But I do that not intended to stay broke, right?

02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:44.080
But based on a foundational belief

02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:47.520
that if I bring to bear

02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:52.560
all of my sort of quiver of creative arrows to it, right?

02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:56.680
That I can create something of value, right?

02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.280
In the world, but hopefully also financially

02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:02.000
that then I can sell to someone.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.040
And you know, every time I've done that, Lex,

02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:07.000
I've gotten into the black.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.640
So it's a risk.

02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:11.160
And I have to have a certain risk threshold

02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:12.440
financially to do that.

02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.440
But I believe so deeply in these stories

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:15.680
that I'm willing to do that.

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:17.200
I didn't have to do that with Hunger Ward.

02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:20.080
Luckily, I had funders for that film.

02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:24.440
Yeah, yeah, take risks in this life.

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:25.720
It's gonna pay off.

02:15:26.680 --> 02:15:28.400
Which reminds me of, let me ask you,

02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:31.080
I already asked you for advice about,

02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:34.320
for a filmmaker, how to win an Oscar.

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:35.840
Well, I haven't won an Oscar.

02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:38.040
How to get nominated for an Oscar, that's true.

02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:42.120
Or just how to make great documentaries,

02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:42.960
how to make great film.

02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:44.960
But let me ask, even zoom out bigger.

02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:48.240
Yeah, you mentioned some of these things,

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.440
doing the things that you think matters.

02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:52.960
What advice would you give to young people,

02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:54.600
high school, college,

02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:01.040
dreaming of living a life worth living?

02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:03.840
What advice would you give them about career,

02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:06.080
or maybe just life in general?

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:08.080
How to have a life they can be proud of?

02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:11.280
Yeah, I don't know how you're gonna react to this,

02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:13.040
given sort of your expertise.

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:17.320
But I would say, put down the smartphone.

02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:19.480
Step away from the monitor, right?

02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:23.640
Because real life is not a screen, right?

02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:27.040
I believe that sort of the foundational skills,

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:30.480
which are conducive and important to success,

02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:34.800
aren't necessarily those technical skills,

02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:39.440
which we're going to learn in trade schools or university.

02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:43.280
I think they're more foundational than that.

02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:48.160
They're learning how to interact and listen.

02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:49.000
With humans?

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.000
With humans, yeah, to really see and listen, right?

02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:55.680
And observe.

02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:58.560
And observe, right?

02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:00.600
And how to step out of your door,

02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:03.040
and if the electricity goes out, right?

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:05.040
And you're five miles away from your house,

02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:07.320
you don't need a smartphone to get home,

02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.240
because you've set visual markers for yourself

02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:12.520
on how to get back to where you live, right?

02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:15.040
I think we're in danger right now

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.800
of living in a world where,

02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:21.480
if the satellites stop functioning, right?

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:27.400
Then a whole lot of people become completely dysfunctional,

02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:28.400
right?

02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:30.880
Because we're so reliant upon the screens in our lives.

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:33.200
So I think there's a lot of foundational skills

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:34.800
that have nothing to do with technology,

02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:38.000
that we need to learn, and everything rests upon those.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.160
So I would say learn those foundations,

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:40.800
learn how to write well.

02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:43.360
Read a lot, right?

02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:45.640
It's a different kind of knowledge and wisdom

02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:47.400
that comes out of that.

02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:49.520
So reading is kind of the equivalent of listening,

02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:54.520
and observing, and writing is kind of integration

02:17:56.240 --> 02:17:58.480
of all of that that you've observed and listened to,

02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:00.520
and tried to express something with that.

02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:02.600
I think my training in the theater

02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:06.720
has served me so well in the documentary world, right?

02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:08.960
Because it's all about interaction,

02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:11.920
and listening, and talking, and dialogue, right?

02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:14.200
And that's what I do in documentaries, right?

02:18:14.200 --> 02:18:15.840
Is I listen.

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.120
Yeah, we mentioned fear.

02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:22.640
Being an introvert, I'm very afraid of people,

02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:24.640
but I'm drawn to them,

02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.960
and fascinated by them because of that.

02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:28.240
Enjoy listening to them.

02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:29.080
Totally.

02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:31.960
And observing them.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.120
And you mentioned reading.

02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.360
You mentioned books as a catalyst,

02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:37.960
as a stimulator of your imagination.

02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:42.360
Is there books in your life, a couple, one, two, three,

02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:46.240
that kind of left an impact,

02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:51.240
or a little bit of spark of inspiration early on in life

02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:54.400
that stand out from your memory?

02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:58.360
I was given The Prophet by Killio Debron

02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:01.840
as a graduation present from my high school

02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:05.960
English teacher, and I still have that book

02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:08.120
in a special place on my bookshelf,

02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:12.760
because I think it speaks to the nature of human experience,

02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:14.760
and I return to it all the time,

02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:16.400
because there's wisdom there.

02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:19.240
But there's many, many books.

02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:22.520
Fiction or non-fiction, what connects with you, usually?

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:24.240
In the past, for the magic?

02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:27.360
I read mostly non-fiction, most of the time.

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:29.960
Ten Points is a book I love a lot.

02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:31.480
What is Ten Points?

02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:34.080
I think his name is Bill Strickland.

02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:37.000
He was the editor of, I think, Bicycle Magazine.

02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:40.200
And it's sort of his personal memoir

02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:44.080
of his experience growing up with a lot of abuse,

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.680
and how that transformed him as a human being.

02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:49.240
You know, one instrumental book for me

02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:52.000
that I bumped into in my early 20s,

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.160
boy, these are all non-fiction,

02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:55.560
except for The Princess Bride.

02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:59.160
Have to mention, it's an outlier.

02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:03.320
No, no, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.

02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:05.480
I read that in my early 20s,

02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:10.480
and I found so many of the principles in that book.

02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:13.520
What are the habits from that one?

02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:15.920
Seek first to understand,

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:18.800
then to be understood is one of them, you know?

02:20:18.800 --> 02:20:21.840
The notion of proactivity is one of them.

02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:25.080
It's really, and so I've held onto some of those principles

02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:27.960
through my life as well, for sure.

02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:32.360
What have been, you've observed

02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:37.120
suffering darker aspects of human nature

02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:38.920
in your own personal life.

02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:43.000
What has been some of the darkest moments in your life,

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.200
darkest times in your life?

02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:49.440
Is there something that you went through,

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:53.040
and then perhaps you carry it through your work?

02:20:53.040 --> 02:20:54.680
Yeah.

02:20:54.680 --> 02:20:56.560
Probably one of the darkest moments

02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:00.880
was an experience that I had, again, in my early 20s,

02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:03.320
and I was living in Southern California.

02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:08.800
The Pacific Coast Highway

02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:10.640
that goes north and south along the beach,

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:14.000
and there's that little concrete path

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.480
that people jog and ride their bikes,

02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:18.120
and I was riding my bike on the PCH,

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
and I was coming up to a corner on it,

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.880
and I heard this tremendous crash.

02:21:27.520 --> 02:21:31.520
It was really loud, and I came around the corner,

02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:34.680
and it was a car accident, a car crash.

02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:38.000
It was a multiple vehicle crash,

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:43.000
and what had happened is that a Volvo had hit another car,

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:48.040
and then when it hit it, it went over the top of the car

02:21:48.040 --> 02:21:50.200
and hit a Volkswagen van,

02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:52.760
and it peeled away the top of the Volkswagen van

02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:55.080
when it hit it and then landed.

02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:59.520
So three vehicles, and it just happened,

02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:04.200
and lying in the middle of the road

02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:07.440
was a body decapitated,

02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:12.480
and there was another person from one of the cars

02:22:12.480 --> 02:22:15.400
lying in the middle of the road still alive,

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.960
and then on the hood of the Volvo

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:22.360
was this woman who had come through the windshield,

02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:27.360
just a mess, blood everywhere, moaning back and forth,

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:33.880
and a bystander ran into the middle of the road

02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:35.960
and started administering first aid

02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:38.240
to the person lying in the road,

02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:43.240
and I stood there watching the scene,

02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:46.760
and every fiber of my being

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:52.760
wanted to run to the woman on the hood of the Volvo

02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:56.960
and do something, anything, just to be there,

02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:00.600
and it was obvious to me that she was gonna die,

02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:04.040
but I felt like at least if I ran there,

02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:08.160
I could offer some comfort for her last moment,

02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:12.120
and right then, the sirens started to blare,

02:23:12.120 --> 02:23:16.680
and I knew that there'd be paramedics there within minutes,

02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:19.000
that people would come to help,

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:23.600
and I froze, and I was scared,

02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:27.080
and I didn't do anything,

02:23:27.080 --> 02:23:31.240
and I watched while this woman died

02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:33.640
on the hood of the Volvo,

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:40.840
and that experience is sort of seared into my consciousness.

02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:45.760
The fact that I watched and didn't act,

02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:49.880
I feel is one of the great failures of my life,

02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:52.640
that I wasn't able to act in a moment of need,

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:56.600
no matter how small, and from that,

02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:00.840
I made a decision out of that experience

02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:04.000
that if I ever found myself in a situation

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.440
where I had the ability to act and I could act

02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:10.520
to help another human being in such need,

02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:15.520
that I would act, that I wouldn't let fear freeze me,

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:21.080
instead, I would allow that fear to catalyze me into action

02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:25.360
and do something and intervene in whatever way I could,

02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:27.120
even if I didn't have the skillset.

02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:33.280
And in some ways, all of that echoes in your documentaries.

02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:37.120
You're not gonna let fear stop you from trying to help.

02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:40.760
I think that experience, that experience of failure,

02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:45.200
what I framed as just human failure on my part,

02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:49.600
is foundational, probably, to my work.

02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:52.000
I don't want that to happen again, Lex.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.960
I don't want to be that person who watches.

02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:57.240
I want to do what I can when I can.

02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:02.720
If we zoom out, you were just one human

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:05.000
that witnessed that, that trauma.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.640
You're one human that witnessed so much suffering

02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:11.520
in different parts of the world.

02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:15.720
And as we zoom out across space and time and look at Earth,

02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:20.720
why do you think we're here on this Earth?

02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:24.840
What's the meaning of human civilization?

02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:29.840
What's the meaning of your life, of individual human life?

02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:34.520
And broadly speaking, what is the meaning of life,

02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:35.840
Sky Fitzgerald?

02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:37.360
No, boy, yeah.

02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:45.000
For me, I can speak personally on that only,

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.120
and that's that I believe that the meaning of my life

02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:51.080
is to try to make the world

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:52.760
a little bit better before I go.

02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:00.320
When I was in theater in grad school,

02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:07.360
I directed a play called Shadowlands by C.S. Lewis,

02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:08.760
and there's a quote from that.

02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:10.200
It goes like this.

02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:12.160
We're like blocks of stone

02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:16.280
out of which the sculptor carves the forms of men.

02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:20.200
The blows of his chisel, which hurt us so much,

02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:21.680
are what make us perfect.

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:26.600
Now, I would take away the perfect part, right?

02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:30.680
But I think I've remembered that quote for so many years

02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:33.960
because I believe in the underlying notion

02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:36.600
that the blows of the chisel,

02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:39.000
which are the experiences that we go through,

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.360
shape us, right?

02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:43.920
Necessarily so, and hopefully shape us

02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:45.720
into a better human being.

02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:48.840
And in my case, a human being that I hope

02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:53.640
can make the world a little better through those blows.

02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:54.800
Before it's over.

02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:56.840
Yeah, before it's over.

02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:00.040
Before you go, as you said, do you think about that?

02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:05.040
You think about the going part, your mortality?

02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:06.200
You ever think about that?

02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:07.640
You said you don't have a death wish,

02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:09.520
you tried to minimize risk,

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:10.880
but eventually it's gonna be over.

02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:12.440
Yeah, for all of us.

02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:13.280
Absolutely.

02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:14.600
Well, speak for yourself.

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:16.840
Well, you've got other plans and stuff.

02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:18.320
I tend to merge.

02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:20.440
I'm going to merge with the robots.

02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:23.440
I mean, body, no, not at all.

02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:26.520
Yes, for all of us, unfortunately or fortunately,

02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:28.520
or who the heck knows.

02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:33.320
But do you ponder your mortality?

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:34.520
Are you afraid of it?

02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:39.880
I live with my mortality knowing that it's fleeting,

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:41.120
that my life is fleeting

02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:44.200
and that I'm gonna go into the ground

02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:46.600
just like everyone else or maybe as ashes.

02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:50.320
So I live with that knowledge every day,

02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:54.400
but I don't allow it to stop me or hold me up.

02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:58.120
Rather, I really, it drives me.

02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:00.680
It drives me to try to get as much done as I can

02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:03.000
before I go, right?

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:05.760
Yeah, so the knowledge of your death

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:07.800
is a kind of dance partner

02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:09.560
and you try to dance beautifully.

02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:13.160
Sky, you're an incredible human,

02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:15.160
an incredible artist and filmmaker.

02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:18.080
And it's a huge honor that you would sit

02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:20.880
and spend your really valuable time with me today.

02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:22.400
I really, really enjoyed this conversation.

02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:23.240
I did too.

02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:24.060
Thanks for having me, Lex,

02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:26.000
and thanks for doing what you do.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.520

And now, let me leave you with some words from Elie Wiesel.

02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:41.680
The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.

02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:45.840
The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference.

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:49.840
The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference.

02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:54.840
And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.

02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:59.400
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
